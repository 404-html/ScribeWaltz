Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Oh Shit. Here we go. Recording. Oh, you know what? What? Okay, go ahead. Go ahead. We're done. So many goddamn enemies on boiler fucking Gracie. I, we don't know. Fuck that. Yes, we're broadcasting right now. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the flashlight. If you go to Joe, who was that? Oh, so you, Brian, you goddamn rookie son. Uh, if you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link for the flashlight and enter in the code name Brogan, you get 15% off of the number one sex toy for men. Ah Ha. And with that said, oh, the black guy, you're a gentle, just sound today. Are there people that are on the fence about the fleshlight? But that 15% I was like, you know, when I heard the 15% I just jumped on it. Like maybe, maybe there's a few frugal master bars out there. Ignore 15% fucking off. That never makes a difference. Even when I was broke ass motherfucker, 15% off, never meant really? It. Never, not 15 didn't mean I ain't gonna make me get up out of my fucking chair and call somebody in order some shoes.

Speaker 2:          00:01:06       Well they made me 30 Penn, I'm a member of, I'm a member of all the coupon websites and if I had a flashlight web 15% off. Fuck yeah, I'm like free shipping, you know. That to me is like, oh I got extra free something.

Speaker 1:          00:01:18       Whoa, okay. I think everybody thinks differently when it comes to money. I think you're a lot like me and that you would rather not think about it at all. I don't want to think about thinking about it as much as you have to. I'm like, well how much is it? Would you consider yourself? To be honest, it's totally cool. Would you consider yourself a really big tipper? Yes. Oh really? Yeah, like 20% the coupons. I don't know that many of the guys in the coupons, but usually guys that are in the coupons usually generally don't tip

Speaker 2:          00:01:45       well. I, I consider it more of like that's human and you know, like I'm helping somebody out compared to like, fuck if I can get $20 off Amazon, I'm going to do that. Fucking Amazon in the ass. Yeah. Or you know, Amazon's actually hooking you up and giving you a way to make, what is the reason for coupons? I mean, is it just to see what happens when, when they offer people less money for things? Well, I don't know what the grocery stores have changed. They used to be relying on coupons. Now if you don't, if you go to a grocery store without one of those cards, you're pretty much paying a good 15 20% more than you would if you didn't have a card on here. What's the benefit in that for them? Because for, uh, for those people that aren't loyal, they just come in and just spend money and

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       I think a charge him arms advertising. When you put up a billboard and it said call now 15%. It's just, it doesn't mean shit to them. It's just a reason to have an ad like that will have like a storyline for an ad. So let's just say 15% off, we'll blow that up. It doesn't really matter. It's a reason to get the logo out. That's makes sense.

Speaker 2:          00:02:44       So sort of like an advertising move. Yeah, but I've always thought it was probably to see like maybe our shit's too expensive. Maybe we could actually make more money if we sold more of them at a lesser price. Probably also averages out. Like if you have a product that's $20 but you could also charge

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       $30 for it, then the average is at the people that use the coupons would probably make it more like 25 economics major right now. Pull it is fucking hair out. Usually know what you're talking about. I know. By the way, did we say this is Eddie Bravo Ramos. We opened the show with coupon. Your, it's a new day are he's not even here. I've never been one to, whenever I go to Ralph's or something like that. And they always said, Ralph's our local supermarket. Do you want to? Uh, do you want to have a Ralph's Card fucking card? I don't want another car. I have a free shake on a roll backs card or something. I'll just throw that away. You guys. So not good with coupons. They're keeping all that stuff in a little bag. Different mindset. Eddie and I have this, it's a modified stoner mindset. We get a lot of shit done.

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       But you and I are both the same way in that if we don't have to think about something, I'm not going to think about it. And if it's not going to make a difference in my life, I'm not, not gonna physically, physically feel the difference. Come on now. I need to do that. I guess in certain for the goods, man, it helps you. You need to like save money. Yeah. I need to make sure if you just didn't smoke fucking cigarettes, cancer boy, just throw those fucking things away. You'd have a lot of extra money. That's a terrible fucking drug, man. You know I, that was the number one thing when everybody, anyone ever talks anything about politicians caring. I just say, why the fuck don't they ever talk about cigarettes? What was the last time you heard Obama talk about everyone should quit smoking?

Speaker 1:          00:04:34       Getting on TV, talking about the 400,000 people. Sure. But it doesn't, you try to quit or hasn't he tried to quit? Everyone has. You know what? I'll be honest. Every now and then I have a cigarette. I don't have a problem with cigarettes. You know, every now and then, you know what it does when you get high and you throw cigarette on top of that, after five minutes you get like a big head buzz. That's pretty fucking cool. You've been having those menthol cigarettes. I can tell I really liked cigars and cigars are essentially, it's just pure nicotine that you're smoking. You know, it's, this is probably the same buzz that you get off of a cigarette and one way or another I don't recommend it, but I have full control of my body. I've been drinking since I was 14 probably younger than that and I never drink alone.

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       I never, I'm not an alcoholic. I don't, I only drink in social situations. And if I don't drink for four or five months, you know, I'm not an alcoholic. You rage hard in social situations. I wrote a blog about you. I'm a temporary drunk. Yeah, well you, what you have is um, you, you have the ability to control your impulses and even though your impulses might be crazy, you know, you have ability to put them in check. Whereas a lot of people when they start drinking and blackout and become another person, those people, they can't just not do it again the next day. The next day comes around. They have a couple of drinks in them. They can't step aside. You can stop at two drinks. How

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       about the pizza story and Phoenix are, no. Yeah man, we were, we were out. Okay. We were ham or 2005, 2005 I did the Improv and Phoenix and Tempe rather, we had a great old time, went out, got our party on God, drink on. We were hammered and we're at a pizza place and it's two o'clock in the fucking morning and Eddie Bravo was on the Atkins Diet. So he's blackout drunk, blackout drunk. And he still won't eat as crusts. God rest his soul. Gracie, Tony [inaudible] Harris way last year. I always fucking committed to that shit. I also remember your cheat day retake ridiculous. It's hard to have a Sundae with pizza inside of it. Chocolate sauce. Anything you can think of, you're just dudes are famous for. The cheat days is a dude who trains with Bj Penn. I Apologize, I forgot his name. He's a wrestler and he would put pictures of his shit online cause it was so ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          00:06:48       He would go to Mcdonald's and get a quarter pounder and then he would go to Krispy Kreme and it would cut a donut in half and he put the cheeseburger in between the donut. Oh Man. He was just fucking off some foods cheap. When you're on the Atkins Diet and you're restricting carbs, you think about bread like every day. Sometimes you dream about Brad and you're thinking about that Sunday and you're thinking, you're thinking about food so much Wednesday. I'm like, damn, all that matters to me. It's just a couple more days. Hold on. And I did it for almost three years where I was looking forward to that Sunday. Oh Man. And when I would wake up and stuff my face and I'm like, it's 11 o'clock in the morning, I'm stuffed and it's my cheat day. I've been waiting for this all week. I want to get hungry again. That's our spoken a lot of pot getting the cushiest of Kush.

Speaker 3:          00:07:31       You ever grow up? I'm sure I did. I mean you had to have some of the Shit I saw you. He was just ridiculous. I even know my fattest day never ate and then I would extend it to Saturday night. I call, I'm going to start early and then for like after a year I Saturday night and all day Sunday? Yes. You waited till midnight and then I did that for about a year. I would start Saturday night and midnight and just go off. Right. And take it all the way through Sunday. Dennis started Saturday afternoon around six UFC, you know, were eating before the UFC. Okay. Then it just became, let's just do Saturday and Sunday and less. I think about it no more. Let's just wake up Saturday, fuck it, and then when I added Friday night that I was like, I love sitting off opposite cheat day. I was like, I'm not going to get crazy with it now.

Speaker 3:          00:08:22       I'm not going to suffer. And I'm like, well, it's not even making a difference now. Yeah, you were doing that for a long time. I miss those days. That was fun. You are so insane with it. I was disciplined. Very disciplined. Yeah. You would just eat lettuce. I remember you were eating bunny food. You were just eating and time. People thought I lost so much weight. People thought, I remember at Abu Dhabi 2005 like people on the Internet were saying that, man, is he a heroin? I because Enzo said something had Enzo said something like on the Internet where they thought I was on like drunk. Will you growing your out then

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       you'll no, no. You haven't done that yet? Nope. Nope. It was hiking the way it is now and I was really skinny and it was from the Atkins Diet and people at Abu Dhabi thought I was on heroin. That was, that's a true story. When people were on underground talking Shit, oh he's, look, he's on heroin. It looks like shit. Crazy thing is how much you train you. You train a lot, but you would eat so bad that you would gain weight. You would just go off of Burritos and you would just go off. So now I'm like on a diet like part of the day, part of the day, like w how much of the day? A good 65 70% well, as long as you just maintain, you know, it's when you let yourself go and then you've got to get fucking skinny again. That's what happens with dudes and it was, it happened with girls.

Speaker 4:          00:09:39       It happens with everybody. That's the hardest thing is getting back in shape. You know, it's not staying and shapes they can shape is not that bad. You get some momentum and keep it going. The one thing to taught me a lot though is my girlfriend cooks for me all the time now. She moved in, so we were, I rarely go out before man in the middle of Hollywood. I had choices. That was all night that we want Carl's Jr. You Want Jack in the box? You know you can get Wendy's all night. You can, there's so much taco bells right there. You have so many choices in it. All I gotta do is get in my car. And what? What got me fat was the place I lived at before you, it was terrible parking. You got to, sometimes you have to punt four blocks down the street just to get a parking.

Speaker 4:          00:10:19       So if I had a good parking when I got home after Jujitsu, I wouldn't been want to lose that parking. It wasn't worth it that Carl's Jr was not worth losing my parking. But then once I got my old official parking man, you can leave at anytime. Just right there at three in the morning, ready to go to your place. Used to be brutal for parking. Yeah, I miss that shit. How do people live like that? That sucks. That's where live like that. And I'm thinking like what if he had to poop really bad and you couldn't find a parking spot and you always like champ pants. It's like when we were talking about with the, all the area around the Improv that everywhere you go on those side streets, it's all residential only parking and like you're literally not even allowed to park there.

Speaker 4:          00:10:56       They just did just saying sorry. Even though this is the street, there's no room for regular people. You have to live here to park your fucking car here because we fucked up and we put too many people in one spot. You can park. That's ridiculous man. That's the worst thing in the world above when you do sets and Hollywood. I used to park my car in the Improv. I you still let the valet parking but they let some fucking chick, she was, she was drunk man and she fucked up my car. She just, she was pulling it out of a spot and you know, it was a really tight little area and she just turned her wheel and hit the gas and just jacked my fucking car and she didn't have no insurance and I'm like, why am I letting these people parked my car? And you're obviously not looking after my shit. So I stopped doing that. You know that that reminded me of back in 2002 when you tore your knee and you couldn't drive your Nsx and I had a driver, you were so mad at me, it not a driver. He was really mad at me. It wasn't really mad at you. He kept like putting it neutral on the highway

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       and then dropping it down and it was just sex. It had a lot of horsepower, man. I wasn't just, I was driving caravans and shit up to that point. And Larry 1972 Ford curry and it was so funny because I've never been seen someone so like breaking down the effect of car has on girls, his needs tor, he's sitting in his car, I'm trying to help him and he's fucking, he's got pain here and he's like fuck, he's grinding my clutch fucking like locked up and it's, I'm taking him to like emergencies, not surgery. We had to go to get an MRI. The doctor gave me an MRI

Speaker 2:          00:12:29       immediately. We screaming on the top of your lungs cause I fucked my knee up.

Speaker 5:          00:12:32       I was just, this was the reading of tears. I've had a bunch of different knee injuries, but uh, the most painful one is ironically the one that healed the quickest. That's the meniscus one. Once they did the meniscus surgery, it was like six weeks later I was on the mat again. But when I had my ACL torn both times, it's not that painful. Not nearly as painful. The meniscus is what's really painful. The ACL just kind of snaps and it's fucked and it hurts a little bit and then you can't move your legs wobbling. Like what the fuck? And then you go to a doctor and they go, you don't have a ligament anymore. You have to get an artificial ligament put in place and it takes six months before you totally heal up. But the pain is nothing. It's like it's not that big a deal. The pain of the meniscus tear. I had what's called a bucket handle tear and it's called the bucket handle. Cause you know how a bucket handle can like flip up and it can like stop like in the center and the center position. Well, that's what it's like. It's like the handle of a bucket, like literally peels up and gets locked in place. So this sliver of meniscus is law and it's tearing and it's just excruciating fucking like soft tissue pain. It's really good.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       I had, I don't know what this is called, where that top bone in the bottom bone, like I, I twisted my leg weird and it hit each other like, oh, the thing in the middle, I guess the knee socket or snapped out a place in the top and hit, they hit bottom bone and then snapped right back. It's still fucked up, but it's still, yeah, it's still feels like it's going to happen again all the time. Like I'm so paranoid because when that happened, I was filming a home video and when I, in the video you can just hear me scream like bloody Mary, Mary, and then a bloody Mary bloody murder. And it, I'm thinking of a different thing and then post it. Yeah, you have that shit. It's, it's one of those videos my dad has on some VHS tapes somewhere. I'm gonna have to get

Speaker 5:          00:14:14       scour your dad's closets. We need to have a video for this story. So I never finished the video too. So, um, you, did you break a ligament?

Speaker 2:          00:14:22       I think he said he said that, I mean this was a long time ago, but he said it. He told me what happened and then I had to wear like this cast thing for a long time. Uh, maybe like six months or something like that. Ever since then. Six months, Huh? Yeah, it was a while.

Speaker 5:          00:14:36       Wow. Yeah. The body is so God damn fragile. I was in, um, we were in Pittsburgh and we were watching dudes on motorcycles with no helmets. They don't have a helmet law there. Just watching them drive around like, God, you silly fuck. Like your body's so fragile.

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       You don't even know you. If you knew what could happen to your head if you hit the ground, would you be willing to roll those dice, which you really be willing to just get on a bike with a bunch of people and trust them not to slam into you. Trust them. Not to smash your fucking head off the concrete. Really. You didn't just trust him. The problem with motorcycles is that the reason you get it is because you want chicks to see you on the motorcycle. The helmet, they can't see you. So that's why there's hardly guys they like had found a loophole. They just a little cap on the fucking top. They want their face exposed. Man. It always goes into that with you. It always goes to his dudes were in that Nsx. We're driving around, I'm a fucking pain. Eddies driving and dropping it down to fourth gear on the highway and she doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. Right. While he's looking around, he's like, damn, check show looking at me man. Cause I'm looking at me. They never look at me in my fucking Bronco are looking at me like that bitch right there. She's looking at me, man. She's looking at me right now. Explore, explore. I'm sorry

Speaker 3:          00:15:48       dude. When we would drive, we would drive your Barracuda, the big fish, a catfish, catfish, sick fish. Old Men wanted a soccer dad. They were like pulling up going whole, everybody that was, you know. Have you ever been in his car driving around? Everybody says Holy Shit, like 15 year old dudes that are rappers and shit look over and trip out. You know it's, it's too ridiculous. It's too, it sounds like a tyrannosaurus rex. Someone like machine when you rather, how does it sound? I forget slot a lot. I used to have that. My friend just did a photo shoot with that kit from the original knight rider car from the 80s though. A photo shoot with a kit. Yeah. And now it's like thinking wow, some guy owns kit and he rents it out like some that, yeah, I think it's an Asian businessman and he rents it out and I'm thinking, wow, they actually let kit mixed with porn.

Speaker 3:          00:16:39       That's weird to me. I guess I can have control. Yeah. Isn't that weird though? I think after 25 years it's like public domain or so I wonder if it is, some things are right on some movies, public domain and like books are public domain. Yeah. A certain amount of time. Yeah. How many, how many years is it comfort with theater? I think you could do anything you want with those lines. You can start your own TV station. I'm just putting nothing because it cost, it costs more to just get the, keep the license going then if they're worth really so no one owns them. Literally you can't nobody. Yeah, nobody owns it. Nobody owns in the public domain. How many movies you think, dude, I'm not an expert in this panel. There's nobody in the public. Once I plug public domain, you've got to get the shit registered every 25 years or so. And if there's no one there to register and most of those guys are in China and they're dead from the triads and nobody's allowed to

Speaker 4:          00:17:41       the mine from my old taekwondo days, my friend Larry Jones, Larry Jones was a phene for Chinese Kung Fu movies and he would always go and

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       he would like come to the gym the next day. Oh Man, I saw this bad ass Shaolin is Shaolin seven months. He would like every week it will be some new fucking Kung Fu movie that he just saw and loved and he would get together with a bunch of his friends from the gym and they would all go watch he's come from, would they get excited and while she's there was like real fighters and they're going to watch these shitty Kung Fu movies and I try to watch them. I never got it. I tried, man. I sat down and then I tried to watch them. That's the problem. Anybody who got Bruce Lee first is not into comfort with theater. I don't think so. How could you tried? You know what I mean? I think, I dunno what it is really. That's just my guess. But after on Bruce Lee or like fuck these guys are, everyone's trying to, I mean there was Bruce lies about that.

Speaker 3:          00:18:32       He's more than one, right? How many downsides were there? How famous was he? Was he famous like in China? Was he going to them popping bottles? You know what I mean? For a couple of years we've probably got laid. He was like Dan Cortez. That's how dumb these people think the people are, that they could just put a fake Bruce Lee up and a good percentage of them automatically get to know the difference. Is it because they, he was almost playing a character, would you think like maybe like he was almost like a James Bond put out game of death. They only had 10 minutes of that movie with Bruce Lee tree. The whole movie is not Bruce Lee. It's a game of death. The beginning is, but the beginning of game of death is the end of return of the Dragon. They start with the Chuck Norris fight, so it looks like a Bruce Lee movie, but that's another movie.

Speaker 3:          00:19:17       So they replayed that scene again, the exams in the beginning, that's how the movie started. Game of debt starts. The only thing that's Bruce Lee is the end where he goes up and fights, fights. Kareem Abdul Jabbar, that's all him, but everything, the whole movie is an imposter. I need to see. Wow. I need to see that again to every year and there's a beginning. There's a scene where the big Muesli sitting in his dressing room, because this is how they started, they start the movie with the fight with Chuck Norris and return of the Dragon. And then the movie is about a famous soup martial arts superstar loosely based on Bruce Lee. So once all the credits are over and the fights over, they go cut. And then Bruce, I think Bruce Lee walks offset. Like all of a sudden that was just a movie, that fight scene and it's about a famous actor and the Chinese tried, they're trying to control them or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:20:08       So from that point on, it's a fake Bruce Lee. The whole time he's sitting in his dressing room, he's talking to this guy, this mafia guy, and they put a picture, a still picture like right where his head's at. There's a still picture. So it's a Bruce, a picture of Bruce Lee. You could see the guy's shoulders are moving. It's a moving picture. That's how bad it was. And everyone wants to see this. I don't want to believe I was seven years old when that shit came out and get to know the difference. I didn't know the difference. They fooled me. They pulled the kids maybe back then. That special effect actually for the adults too and the whole movie he's got big shades on and they never get any closer. It's always from the side and he's got big shit. I wonder how much that one would be cost.

Speaker 4:          00:20:49       How much does that cost to make? And they probably made a fuck load of money with it too. Right? Cause people probably saw your movie. They didn't have fucking Yelp back then. They didn't have fan Dora. You know what I mean? You can't look find out how bad a movie was by just going online. Like now. Well now you find out real quick. If a movie's a piece of shit, it's like it could be out a couple hours and people were already freaking out about it. Yeah, it may even before, because people get screeners, they get, they get, they get previews before people go to previews. You can't sneak a shitty movie through anymore. The bank and that the amp committed took weeks before everybody figured out. That movie sucked. Yeah, I came up with that. Yeah, the kids, I thought it was great because the end is a class.

Speaker 4:          00:21:28       It's still Bruce Lee. They ended strong. He fights down in a Kareem Abdul Jabbar, some taekwondo guy. All that Shit's beautiful. Yeah, that was pretty bad ass and that's, that's really the only seen people like, remember when they watched as a kid, you remember, remember game of death. He's finding Kareem Abdul Jabbar. That's really all you remember. You don't remember all the bullshit fake shit, but when me and my friends are talking about the best Bruce Lee move move ever to Wa, the the Best Bruce Lee movie ever was actually done by the fake Bruce Lee. If guy was holding him, a guy who was holding him like this, he came from [inaudible] and held them and the fake Bruce Lee did a backflip, kicked him and landed back on its feet. It was a fake Bruce Lee. The vape was there from game of Dad. He, the guy did a backflip, kicked him, and then landed on his feet.

Speaker 4:          00:22:17       I wonder if that one dude is that he still goes around. You remember that scene came of, he looks like Bruce Lee. It's not loosely ads. Meek. We need a documentary on the fake Bruce Lee. All of us. Well we need a documentary on the guy who did that flip. But that was cuts in it. So it wasn't like one thing, you know, it was, there was some cuts and so it wasn't just some wild kamikaze type shit, but that wasn't the top three of best Bruce Lee moves ever. And it wasn't even him. When I met Chuck Norris, who was one of the few times in my life where I was genuinely freaked out, like, like I'm shaking his hand, I'm going to meet him and him to, and he knows who I am. He's talking to me and I'm like, Holy Shit, this is Chuck Norris. Like this is really Chuck Norris.

Speaker 4:          00:22:57       And the third thing I thought about was that movie with him and Bruce Lee. And I'm like, this motherfucker fought Bruce Lee in a movie. You know what I'm saying? I mean that is a crazy scene too. He's like the bad ass karate guy and then loosely and him go at it. Holy Shit. That was a good scene. It be hard to top Bruce Lee. Just the base. I used to like Chuck Norris because Chuck Norris was down with Bruce Lee because by association, even though Chuck Norris wasn't as dynamic as Bruce Lee, he was still in a Bruce Lee movie, you know, and there was some cool shit about him because he was American. He wore cowboy boots and fucking cowboy hat and he jacked guys up sort of like a karate but American style, you know. I thought he was a high, low most McQuaid him. David Carradine. Come on son. You Remember Billy Jack? Yes. Cowboy with a roundhouse kick is known for his roundhouse.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       You remember he would tell the guy, I'm going to put this foot upside your head and there's not a thing you can do about it. I remember thinking at the time, wow, that is fucking a white guy talking shit. Nobody wasn't really white. He was an American Indian. Nobody under 30 remember until the job Billy Jack, like there was always these hippie bitches. They were like around him bothering him all the time. You know, he would like take care of the hippies and he was like half Indian or something, wasn't he? I don't fucking know. That'd be cool if Chuck Norris flew around in Airwolf. You don't like that was his modes of transportation. If you flew around with a giant helicopter from the eighties you remember those when, how did we ever talk about this? It seems like we did where helicopters were really popular in the 80s and it was like blue thunder Airwolf and there was all these sitcoms about helicopters, drama shows, drama shows.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       Yeah. What the fuck was that helicopter? It's like, you know, it's like sort of, we were talking about Knight Rider, I'll fucking, you know a show about a car. Right. But at least that car talk back then was just like, no, that's just a bad ass helicopter. Remember was Roy Stridor Scheider yes. In blue thunder, blue thunder. Stupid movie about a giant helicopter went crazy. What the fuck, man? It's amazing when you go back just a couple of decades and look at the shit that people are willing to tolerate. People were so stupid. Yeah, I know. If you want evolution, man, you need look no further than human television. Look, look, look at TV shows for like the 50s. Go try to watch like Andy Rooney. I was watching a clip online. It was from the Andy Griffith show and it was um, it was a Jack Nicholson. Jack Nicholson was playing a bad guy and um, Ron Howard was in it and when he was a little boy, when he was opie who he was before he was opening preop pre AOP.

Speaker 1:          00:25:31       Wow. What was, who was he? He was opening on happy days before. What was he on the other show? The Andy Griffith show. He was the little Brat Kid. There's a little boy, he's a little boy and Jack Nicholson is there and it's like, it was fucking phones on and it's so stupid. It's just so obviously dumb, you know? It's like if you had it on today, you would just start throwing shit at the TV. Go, what the fuck? Kind of acting is what the fuck kind of shows us who wrote this stupid thing. But back then that shit flew. That was, that was entertainment. I can't watch fucking anything in black and white except for twilight zone. I can still watch that cause it didn't happen. They never had, they sometimes had happy endings, but you never knew if it was going to be a bad ending.

Speaker 1:          00:26:13       Sad ending, happy ending. I love that. But one show, one 99.9 of everything back then. To me, my opinion suck. You're right. I Love Lucy. Every now and then you watch that. There was some clever writing and I love Lucy. I mean that thing stood the test of time. It's still showing it now. It's still on now. You're right. Most things suck. But there's a few that fucking that really stand out still like the hustler. You ever watched the hustler with Jackie Gleason and Paul Newman? The movie? Yeah. With who the fuck played Burt, the guy from

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       Shit I forget, but a very famous actor as well and it's fucking incredible. Piper, Laurie, you know the, that woman, she played a a check in the movie. It's a fucking great story. It's like it's a good well acted movie and it's from like 1963 like there's a few who's afraid of Virginia Woolf? That's Elizabeth Taylor. Back when she was hot as fuck. Elizabeth tail was hot as fuck back then. And who's afraid of Virginia Woolf is a bad ass fucking movie that completely holds the test of time. If you watch the movie today, be like, Whoa, that was a good guy that I'm moving. And it was like from 1960 or something like that. There's a few movies from back then when they really nailed it. They really got it right.

Speaker 2:          00:27:20       Do you remember that movie? I Africa, the name of it? It had, I think Joe Piscopo during his big, when he was kind of famous in the early eighties and it used to have like this little documentary in the middle of Johnny dangerously. Is that the name of it? Yeah. And John, John and dangerously was, um, what the fuck is his name? Joe Piscapo. Yeah, Joe Piscopo. And what was the other guy? The good, the guy was Batman. The first Batman. Michael Key. Michael Key. Everybody remember the cartoon? I as a kid, I remember thinking how cool this was that your penis in you and it was like this animated cartoon of this penis and two balls walking around and stuff. I don't remember that.

Speaker 4:          00:27:56       Check out this penis sometime. It's pretty George. See Scott was the other guy who was in the hustler, so fucking great movie. And that's 1961 man. It's not even 63 61 they were a, it's back then. Damn. They were stupid. Really Mad. I mean it's, it's a good movie, but even though it's a good movie, you could still tell me how goofy people were back then. Richard Nixon, you watch him talk of your bullshit. Radar doesn't go off when you're watching Richard Nixon. Just any kind of speech. It like, it's like George W. Bush. Yeah, that's what I was going to say. If you, yeah, if you can't say that because of Bush, the real problem with, with dump Alta or right lying politicians is there's a lot of fucking dumb people out there, man. Yeah. And George W. Bush is the master for sure. He's the master of the dump, the dummies.

Speaker 4:          00:28:45       But Richard Nixon was pretty bad too. Everyone else's, not that bad. Bill Clinton, Smooth Obama, smooth as hell. Even Ronald Reagan was smooth this out. You know, Richard Carter, he sounds like he's a smart guy. Richard Carter, James Richard Carter, you know that fucking guy, opie Richard Nixon. He's just, he sounded like a smart guy, but he was always, he sounded paranoid and insincere in everything he said. Richard Nixon, Richard Nixon, he was a, he was a piece of shit. He was a terrible person. He was, he was one of those guys that got away with shit back in a time where you could get away with anything. You know, the days before they killed Kennedy, you know, till you know, till Nixon's era and you know, you'd go deep. The Reagan did. P three p were getting away with all kinds of crazy shit that you can never get away with now. You know, and they got away with a lot of the dirty fucking politics back then to what Nixon did was totally standard stuff. What he got impeached for it water game was something they all did, man. We've been doing that to the Russians forever. You know, I have a buddy, I guess we shouldn't say his, who used

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       to work for the u s embassy in Russia and he would find all these, uh, it was like standard. They would find all these audio detection devices all over the place or audio recording devices and the Russians were listening in to them. They found these Russians, uh, things that they made were so complicated that they operated on the swaying of the building, that that's what powered them. The swaying of the building back and forth actually charged them up and power them. So they had no external source of power. These are like, this was so complicated. He's like, when when they found that stuff, he's like, we didn't even know this shit existed. So that's been standard. People have been spying on people and listening into people. That's just what they do. Every fucking politician, every president did it. You don't think Kennedy did it? You know, everybody likes to look at Kennedy like he's says rosy, you know, beautiful figure from our liberal back, you know, or liberal pass.

Speaker 5:          00:30:37       But Kennedy's family was all fucking moonshine runners. They made all their money selling illegal booze and there was all sorts of people that were just like the tea party. People are today trying to get rid of. Obama gone crazy about the democratically elected president, Democrat president rather. They were doing the same thing for Kennedy. They were wanted for trees and they'd make posters with Kennedy's face on it. Nobody likes to think about that shit because it happened so long ago. What about the fact that he was, out of all the presidents that have ever existed, he's the one who had the worst reputation as far as womanizing. Oh yeah, dude. If they found out what he was doing today, he was probably just straight Clinton and bitches. You know more than Clinton. You think he was? I don't, I don't, I shouldn't say Clinton. And because when Clinton Clinton move is Clinton moves, you get a girl alone, you just whip your cock out, you know, and then they scream and fucking run away from you and freak out and you go to jail.

Speaker 5:          00:31:27       That's a Clinton move. He's the only president that probably rocked it that way. Yeah, it probably is it probably Obama and in that shit, you know it's actually shit up. Obama was probably not what they should do. A president should be smart if they're going to fuck around with these, these interns offered them and their family a thought. The underground cities when shit goes down, they ain't going to say she was a firm believer in the underground cities they're building out. It's not like that much of a secret. Oh yeah. I mean I've seen, I've seen underground bunkers and bases and shit like that. But you're a friend, you're a believer in that shit. Like you want to go there. If the shit goes down. I'm trying to, I'm trying to teach Jujitsu to CIA.

Speaker 1:          00:32:03       Give me a couple of VIP passes the moment, the moment,

Speaker 5:          00:32:07       the first, uh, the first atomic bomb blows or the first asteroid hits. I want to be under that thing. I want to be at the epicenter wherever that bomb goes off. I want to be at the part where

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       all they find a view as a shadow. That's what I want to be. I want to be right there. Fuck that down with some Mad Max shit. I don't want to be sick not having hospitals to go to the song. Yeah, I agree with you though. You know what a mom drops

Speaker 5:          00:32:37       and we're feeling the fallout here, but still alive. What do you do? Like blow your head up. No, no. Look, I'm going to, I'm going to follow my human instincts and keep on keeping on. But if I had to choose between living a life of fucking cancer and radiation and zombies or getting hit in the head where media I'll take getting hit in the head by a media. What's your take on the Zombie situation? It's funny how many fucking shows and movies and things. People that believe they're real. There's video shows where they're talking about preparing against zombies. Yeah, I mean, the book, the reason why is because we know about so many parasitic, uh, animals in, in the, in the animal kingdom that changed the host and turn the host into something that it's not. We know of. There's a aquatic worms we've talked about before.

Speaker 5:          00:33:18       Take a drink. If you're playing the podcasts, we've talked about it before. Will wreak programs, a grasshopper's brain, this aquatic warm, it infest the grasshopper reprograms its brain, and then convinces the grasshopper to drown, to convince is it to jump into water and drown so that it can be born and it busts out of this things body cavity and it makes it commit suicide. So we know that there's all sorts of parasites that changed the host and get the host to do their bidding. And we also know about rabies. We know that, you know, dogs get rabies. That's a wrap son. They're dead. That's it. You've got to kill that dog. They don't even cure him. You can't cure a dog from rabies, so you've got to kill that fucking thing. And if you get rabies, you could die too. So rabies, we'll turn a dog into a vicious fucking animal, like your own pet.

Speaker 5:          00:33:59       I had a dog that had distemper once and it tried to bite me mad. A Doberman Pinscher dove and picture snapping at me. I was like 12 years old. I was stuck in my living room with this dog that was sick and I realized like halfway through, like looking at his dog science, there's something wrong here. I'm like, this thing is really going to get me. This is my dog. My Dog's going to kill me. I really, really thought it was going to kill me. We had to get the dog put down. It was scary shit. People that are dead, they're buried and then they were all out of the dirt. Those people retarded. That's not going to happen. But what could happen is, you know, look, there's all these people that are getting their heads chopped off in the frozen. You know about all that cryogenics I've heard about it.

Speaker 5:          00:34:35       Well, there's people that are getting their whole bodies frozen as well. Like Walt Disney did. Apparently they freeze your whole body and so the one day they can bring you back, regenerate your body tissue. I believe that. Well that might be one zombies happened because maybe your soul's long gone and all of a sudden you just got this, this tissue with no consciousness that needs food all the time and eats anything in front of it. And we'll just grab a person and just start eating you if you don't feed what? I don't want to be cremated. That's the exact reason I wanna. I wanna come back Zombie and want to do that. You're going to kill people. It could be a cool zombies, zombies, all the hangout flesh bro. Do you not learn, listen to the movie or what about pay attention? What about the soul comes back?

Speaker 5:          00:35:18       I gotta go back while does it going to be alive and a couple of seconds I've got to go back. Maybe. Maybe there would be the first generation of people that came back with a memory of the afterlife when Kennedy died in south London. And that. Yeah. I remember when he was playing video games and having to kill the Mormons. Yeah, but Kenny died like a hundred times mean that's ridiculous. But within the episode he came back to the lap. That's never happened. Oh, oh really? Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Every week you just came back and no one said a word about it. Robot chicken. They had an episode or Walt Disney comes back to life and he became like this monster that just ate Puerto Rican babies. It was pretty funny. The real possibility is the possibility that was expressed in that 28 days later that someone comes out with some fucking genetically altered super virus that attacks the human body and literally turns you into some fucking freaky, crazy monster animal thing.

Speaker 5:          00:36:09       Like those 28 days, hard to kiss. Those fucking movies were awesome, man. Especially twen 28 weeks later was okay. It was high. It was pretty good. It's pretty good, but it was following one of the greatest harm movies of all time. You know? There was no way he can fucking really top that, that that thought is very terrifying to people. The thought that one day you wake up and the whole world's fucked and there's people out there in long your sleep and they're, they're coming in and they have axes and shit and they want to eat. You know, I mean, that's, it's a terrible fucking thought. That dot that, you know, people eating human flesh, you know, there's been documented very recently that they think that it was a, it was done like ritualistically for thousands and thousands of years. And then people have been eating people like whether they killed them in battle or that small children, they found a small children with tool marks on their bodies that they're positive and inside their brains in the brain cavity that they're positive with someone's scooping and scraping out their brains and cutting off their meeting, eating it.

Speaker 5:          00:37:06       So people have been, yeah, people have been preying on other people for forever. That's look man, when people are starving to death, you know if you're living like thousands and thousands of years before written language and people are starving to death and you're a bunch of fucking skin wearing savages and you look over the hill and there's a bunch of other skin wearing savage, do you look back at your babies are screaming in agony because there's no food in their body and you say, I'm just going to go kill these motherfuckers and eat them, and people did that shit. I bet they did that shit all the time. They probably ate their own babies too. They did eat there. I'm sure they did. Animals do it all the time if animals do it for sure somewhere a human before it became the human being of circuit 2011 for sure.

Speaker 5:          00:37:46       Someone, someone did everything that an animal's done. Animals always eat babies. I had hamsters man, and they got a wet tale. I think it was what it's called. It's a disease. I was a little kid and all of a sudden our sweet mama hamster started eating her fucking babies, man, and eating them brains first. Like just attacking the brain. My mom was like, get out of the room. I don't want you to seeing this. Get out of here. Oh. And I had a car can see and his fucking hamsters just holding onto our babies and just brain in. Are you kidding? Oh Dude. It was fucking deep, man. You know, that was a real thing, dude. It was deep. It was so hard to watch. I was like, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This mama hamster that I always loved. You know, we had the momma and the, you know, and the baby boy and they got together and they made babies in the baby. Somehow or another got this fucking disease and the mother just killed him in front of us. Killed them in eight dumb bro. It was, fuck. I never looked at that pitch the same way again. She was no longer my friend. You are, you're, you're rocking it to a different set of rules, you know? I can't really, I can't just pick you up at pet. You now I want to bash your brains on the sidewalk. You fucking creep your baby and creep. You know what the fuck man

Speaker 2:          00:38:56       did you ever have those balls where you put the hamster in it and we're like go around the circle and stuff like that. I rolled around and everything. I was so mad at my sister once and I didn't know she had her hamster in a ball and so I'm like, I'll take this. And I kicked it really hard thinking I was just going to break the ball. The hamster just flew right out of it though. And uh, it was okay, but it was the most scariest thing ever. It was so grift yeah, but it was so gross. It's, you know when you're a kid and he sees something disgusting and you're just like, I'm

Speaker 5:          00:39:23       not going to look at it. [inaudible] hamsters. How Durable Hampshire's this motherfucker is filming a video and he falls down screaming like a little bitch cause cause he's, he twisted your knee in a funny way and his hamster, you kick it across the room in a bar doesn't even need to go to the doctor. Yeah. Hamsters. So speaking of people and their affection for animals, I was in Pittsburgh this last weekend for the UFC and it was the same time as a furry convention. I don't know if you're aware of this because I certainly as fuck wasn't, I had heard of the term furry. I'd heard it like very, very abstract. I never sat down and had a conversation with anyone about it. It was just something that I've maybe heard on the news or maybe saw, you know, an article on the internet or something that I never paid attention.

Speaker 5:          00:40:12       I was like, oh there's some people that have a thing about wearing animal clothes and maybe they have sex with animals that I had no idea of the depth of this hobby. Or I go, well I don't know what the fuck you would call it. You know the w this fascination, this, this thing that these people have and this is what the fairy does. What a furry is, is they want to look like a cartoon animal like bugs bunny. I think the terms, the ampule anthropomorphic anthropomorphic and what that means is you know human characteristics and an animal's body and so they, they liked like Wiley Coyote. Like cause he stands up straight and looks like a person you know like that's the shit they're into. So they dress in these costumes that make them look like animated cartoon. People that are animals, you know like dog costumes and Fox costumes, costumes, but they look like mascots or things from like an amusement park. Mascots is the perfect way to describe them. They looked like mascots and I guess a lot of them are wearing mascot outfits and that's where they get these things from and they, all they do the whole weekend is get together and play like they're animals, they don't talk, they have their own language of like grunts and certain things. That means certain noises like they've created like a sub language and a fake language. And when they were staying at the Westin hotel in Pittsburgh, they sold

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       out every fucking room in the hotel. Okay, so there's like 600 rooms in Pittsburgh or the western, they're all furries and they requested a giant litter box in the front lobby that they requested that the west and put in a fucking litter box. So this is what these people do. They go and get litter boxes and they bring them up in the room and they take shits in their litter boxes. They don't use the toilet and they don't wash the light tubes. If you don't, if you don't wash, you stink like an animal. And that's what we're trying to do. They're trying to smell that candle. It's not all of them. I mean some of them, most of these varying, no, no, no. There's women. And to varying degrees of depth to how far you go into this thing, I don't know. You can't see. They're wearing this fucking crazy outfit whole time. We know what their bodies look like, man, they don't talk. So you don't know. You just know she's wearing a girl's outfit. So you assume it's a girl and they have sex with their outfits on and they, they have, uh, the opening in their crotch. They're like undo it. A velcro or zipper or whatever the fuck they do. Whip the shit out and just banging each other right there with their outfits on. They fuck all the time. They fuck crazy, huh?

Speaker 1:          00:42:36       My girlfriend's actually, before I even heard about this, my girlfriend's been actually recently trying to get me to go to our furry party and she's like, you know, we won't have to have sex with anybody else and no one will know who you are and we can just fuck. It's like an orgy by a bunch of furries and wants you to bang her in front of a bunch of other freaks that aren't showering and they're shitting and litter boxes and they're wearing, and she's just for the experience. And I, part of me almost would do it cause no one would know who you are, you know, and stuff like that and you'll see all these other, but I think just seeing a bunch of people fucking in costumes like that would be worth it. And I know it's like so bad. Some of them were diapers too. That's the other guy at the counter. The hotel was saying that it's a real horror short, excuse me. Real horror show for the maids. The port maid's go in there after these freaks of left. Oh God. There's litter boxes and bowls of milk everywhere. The big the order bowls of milk from the hotel and they have him bring it up and like in a giant bowl and they drink it out of a bowl. Like a dog. Yeah, I'd be a bunny. Yeah, you wouldn't be cat. And he looks into my back yard,

Speaker 4:          00:43:40       Jesus rabbit running around and he was like, oh my God, look, it's a bunny. Got a bunny runs and chases it. And you, you're like, oh, he's so sweet. Oh Bonnie's Bro. It's so funny. People would think that. That's a joke. No, that's, that's for real man. Do you think you could kill a bunny to eat it? Of course you could. Fuck no darling. Maybe. Nah, man, I don't even like those people say rabbit stew jokes and all that shit. I don't think that's funny. Really. You really have that much of an affection for rabbits. Mad. That's a little loving creature, man. I mean, we have a relationship going on and man, I love that fucking thing, man. I love rabbits. They look so cute. They're so fucking beautiful. And they don't, they don't meow. They don't bark. That'll make any noise. And they love massages, man. They load us. Don't love massage. She's

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       like, you know what? Cats, but cats love massages and they're more, they, they ask for it. The more flamboyant and the way they ask for. But you pip, I pet a cat fur. I have two cats. I pet them for 30 seconds to a minute. They're gone. They don't want to massage no more. Not The bunny. I is, he's willing to go all night. I could pet them here

Speaker 6:          00:44:48       going, there's no way you, you know my cat spass yeah, that guy. You could pet that cat for a hundred days in a row. Oh really? Oh No. My cat. My cat. You better. I pet him for 30 seconds on how they're raised. If they're raised with people all the time. Like my cat's been with me since she was a kitten. So from the time she was a little, it's all like, you know what jumped me on me own pets and everyday it's affection. So she associates people with affection. But if you, you know, you're around a cat and you just go to work all day and you barely pay attention to the fucking cat, then the cats like, yeah, you can pat me down with you. I got other shit to do. Yeah. So it's all how the cat grows up. Bunnies are so cute that even their poop is cute, but the problem is that high, that doesn't stay.

Speaker 6:          00:45:26       You know, that was on fear factor. We were trying to get people to eat bunny poop. That was one of the things injected by the network. That's bullshit. Maybe they don't say drink your own piss too. There was another one that the network rejected rabbit shit don't stink. My auntie in it, I would totally eat it. Nonfat milk. My ex girlfriend had a bunny and the one thing I did notice the negative part was, is that there was bunny shit everywhere. Like little rabbit turds everywhere to come up with your hand there like raisins. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:45:51       Yeah. Wow. How weird. I love that motherfucker. I have a whole room dedicated to him. You have a room in your house dedicated to all around. He's got a whole room. He doesn't even know he's captured. I leave, I leave the gate open because the gate goes around. Hold them cause we can't let him chew the base board. So it's a room, but there's a gate all the way around in the room and we leave the gate open. He doesn't want to leave. He hates leaving that motherfucker. I got up, I got a castle form. I got a Ufo form. If a car, Thomas Forum. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:46:18       you uh, you would make a great dad. Dude. You don't even know the, the, the, the love that you have for this bunny is pretty fun. It's interesting to see. But the love that you would have for a kid would really freak you the fuck out. Be like, fuck that bunny. The animals take a quick backseat deer. Every woman that says that she has,

Speaker 3:          00:46:39       I had, you know, I almost had, I thought I had it there for a few months. You know that kid. He's 15 now and um,

Speaker 7:          00:46:48       mmm.

Speaker 3:          00:46:50       Not any want to talk about it. Whoa.

Speaker 6:          00:46:53       Just opened up the door and close it on people. Did you meet him at a bar or like,

Speaker 7:          00:46:56       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:57       That's okay. No, I actually, look, what happened is I had an ex girlfriend of mine when I was 26. She, uh, she got pregnant. I thought it was by her. I thought her new boyfriend got her pregnant, but it was, there was a kind of gray area when she got pregnant. Like, Ooh, I think the, you know, maybe it could be mine. She had a baby. Your sister calls me up and says, Hey, Maretta had the baby.

Speaker 7:          00:47:24       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:47:26       You should come down and check it out. It could be yours. I'm like mine. She goes, it looks kind of Mexican because she knows what Thoreau family thought. It looked Mexican. So I came down and I'm like, Oh my God, I'm, I have a son. I totally didn't want it. We had broken up with, they're like, oh, it was around nine, 10 months ago or maybe longer and I didn't want to have anything to do with her. I mean we were done. I had a new girlfriend, I was moving on and now this kid could be mine. I went to the hospital, looked at the kid and all babies looked the same to me. I'm like, you guys think it looks Mexican? I don't think like, yes, look, look at his face. I'm like, he looks like me. So I go, let's take a DNA test then.

Speaker 3:          00:48:05       But you had to wait three months before he could pull the amount of blood that you need to take the test. So I had to wait three months. So I broke up with the girl that I was with and as I said, this is my son. I want to be around for the first three months, you know, so I'm going to treat him like my son. So for three months he, he was my son. And by the third month when it was, we were almost ready to take the test. I don't, I want him to him to be mine so bad. I'm like, man, I got a son, he's three months. Let's do this. Like I was ready to do it, let's go. And then he, it turned out obviously that he wasn't mine and I stuck around for a while and then me and me and me and that the girlfriend broke up a couple of times and we would separate them and come back and see him cause I was in love with them.

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       But, um, it was like a six month stretch when I came back and he was around two after we'd break up, he's running to, and when I got to the house, he looked at me and he didn't recognize me. She wasn't sure. And his mom was like, look, he's the one who took you to the zoo. And we're looking to zoo pictures and he's like looking at the zoo pictures and then look at me. And he's like, he's maybe like a year and a half. And that look right there. I'm like, man, I gotta I got a boat now. Got Now's the time to do that. He didn't even know who I am anymore. I love this little kid. You don't know who I am. I'm gone. So that was the guy in the picture? No, he was in jail. Yeah. That guy was in jail.

Speaker 3:          00:49:20       So anyways, long story short, of course I think about him every now and then. Like, you know, I was in love with that kid. How would it definitely, he's 15 now. He's 15 now. He's in Jujitsu. I found them on Facebook and I went through all the names that it could be. I went through a bunch of guys and sent them messages. I was like, you know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna look for this guy. Wow. So I found him. Holy Shit. So, uh, um, I thought, you know, we went back and forth a little bit on Facebook and, and did you tell him the story? No, we never talked about it. Whoa. So he doesn't know. Now his mom, his mom was remarried. They got a little happy family going. I don't want to cause any problems or anything like that. I just wanted to touch base. And, um, I, you know, he doesn't, he lives like five or six hours away up north and, and, and I, I, um, I got ahold of the nearest Jujitsu school around where he lives in. I said, man, you'd be interested in taking Jujitsu. It's a paragon. It's a Jeff Glover. You know, Jeff Glover, some paragon paragon affiliate, got ahold of the guy. I said, um, you know, I told everyone he's my nephew.

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       I didn't really want to get into details. It as really matter. He's not my nephew, but you know, I thought he was my son for a while. I thought, you know what, I'm going to get them into Jujitsu. He's all into it, man. He's obsessed. Oh Wow. That's awesome. Yeah. He's all facet that he loves it, so, wow. What a crazy story. Did you ever think what would happen if we decided to just stick around with that little dude? Yeah, man, I do. I do. Because at that point, within those first three months, that was my boy accurate. I'm like, like, you know, he was my son. I thought this, he could be my son. I thought he could be

Speaker 2:          00:51:03       deep down. I was thinking, I mean everyone says he looks like me. I don't think he looks like me. That's it. Everyone's saying he looks Mexican. So funny. You know, I didn't even know Eddie was Mexican. I thought he was fucking with me for like the first two years. Cause at the comedy store you're like, I'm half Mexican. I'm like, no, you're not Mexican or you said something like that to me. He used to say he was having, yeah. You said something else Japanese and how fast or something like that. Yeah. You said half Japanese. Half Mexican.

Speaker 4:          00:51:28       Yeah. I used to say that when I was a teenager just because I was an idiot and I want her to see who would believe it. And I'm like, wow, the Ed people believe anything. Did you use to do that with a lot of things he used to like tell people crazy stories and see how far you can go with it. Man, it's still happens, I think the whole, the whole, the whole, uh, why do you get into doing that man? Do you have a hard time not doing? If you look at, if you look at the [inaudible] and then you look in and then you look at that, what we did on the Joe Show, like with a 10 foot 10 foot screws, let me tell people, I don't know. Let me tell you what we did. We were in Denver and I was doing standup and uh, Eddie and Tate and Brian and Dunkin, we were all hanging out and we're walking and we went through this little shopping area that, what does it, those six street malls and what it's called, whatever the mall is, whatever street it is.

Speaker 4:          00:52:20       Anyway, we're going to this downtown Shami here and we see a wig store 2005 2005 was it? And just as a goof we decided to go in this wig store and then first of all we were high as fuck and somewhere in this wig store we came up with the idea of having a fake band and that you guys were all going to wear these wigs. So we, everyone bought wigs. Tate had this crazy afro wig and you had this crazy wig and everyone decided that we were going to play a band called 10 foot screws and we even announced the band like as having an after party in town. So people thought that it was like a real band and Eddie goes on stage, I get off stage, the show's over and he goes on stage with his fucking wig on and sunglasses we have video of it's still right. Yeah. Well there was a whole show. Which episode is it? Seven yeah. How do people find that one? Just type in Joe show seven, but you know, all the episodes were on your website, but since you moved to servers now everything is kind of weird. It was, there were probably getting too much bandwidth. The premise of it was Joe

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       wanted to put together a reality show based on him going to all these clubs across the nation and his posse and me, Tate, Brian, Dunkin, Ari, even Larry back then we were all as a producer when he got, we were all in this, that's what Joe show was. It was an actual origin of the word powerful. When you hear me say powerful, it's all because there's one dude, our friend Lara. So the show, what was that called? The Joe show. You had it on your website. We did about 11 or 12 episodes or something and episode seven we were in Denver. We were trying to come up with a pet premise and then it was, it was all about, we just, we just formed a band. So Joe's on stage and we, the way we sold it was Dunkin would get on stage and we'd say, uh, uh, who's going to the 10 foot screws showed an I, that's what we call it, 10 foot screws.

Speaker 3:          00:54:16       And that was Brian's idea. And so we wanted to, so Dunkin was getting everybody in the audience use it. The fact that we got 10 foot screws backstage and they're playing a big show at the boy with the holiday, the holiday home next to me, I'll know sixth, three to know point logos. So people were like, oh shit, there's a concert tonight. I didn't know about this 10 foot screws. Are they big? So then it was already there too. Who else are you wasn't very, wasn't there for Dunkin was selling it like he would, he was like the host and he was selling it. We got 10 foot screws tomorrow we're going to give away some tickets. So I've got a stack of half off drinks on Tuesday night. I got a two stacks of them and Dunkin introduced me. I was the lead singer, I was the total douchebag lead singer.

Speaker 3:          00:54:58       I was like just basically playing the singer of oasis, but backstage. So we, I got up on stage and said, who wants these tickets to the show tomorrow? Backstage they were going nuts. So like Paul Stanley, I divided the crowd to one side and I said just I Paul static. Okay. This side, let me hear the noise. Like a one to let me hear the noise. Ah. And then I stopped him and I go this side, it was just a total Paul Stanley in 1985 rip off. Most bands find that, find that, find that in, queue it up. Just that part of it. Because when I, when I threw those tickets into the audience too, were flying headfirst over tables that we're scrambling only to find that number Tuesday night, half off drinks and use of crazy man wearing a wig for a band that doesn't exist.

Speaker 3:          00:55:45       Yes. So when the concert let out, people had to walk by backstage. It was a weird, the club was set up. Weird word ever walking out next to backstage and we had the door open and dudes are walking by gone, where's that bad? So we were, we grabbed one dude and we pulled, we were, we pulled in maybe three dudes and we pulled him close the door. Now they're backstage with 10 foot screws and me and Tate are just huge bags were total douche bag. Do you remember those fucking questions you guys, now that I'm thinking about it, it was a great guy got down on his knees. Yes. He wanted to. He was astounded. Do whatever to hang out with the band. He didn't, he thought we were a real band so we got them to do crazy shit. He just wanted to hang

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       out with the bath. So we got, we're going to have to get on your knees. Okay. You're going to have to pray for us. Pray with us like, you know, band sometimes permitted up before they go out. Thank you Jesus. And he would replete, thank you Jesus. And you said for this dig a hole. And then he jumped up and ran away and then Tate was, he's like six foot four. He was so intimidating to the guided one. I like fire back, right. Just takes sitting there looking like a monster, you know, he was scared and then we got girls that he probably thought that you were about to try to get him to suck your Dick. And I keep really probably thought though, I mean you think about it, you're some fucking Wacko living in Colorado. You know some dude who's willing to go to some green room for some band that he doesn't even know, never heard of before, some van, it doesn't even exist.

Speaker 4:          00:57:05       He's on his knees praying back and forth. You in his head when you said that for this dictum about the saga, he probably thought, oh, I fucked up. I done fucked up. I'll do it, but damn, I didn't. I'm not going to like it. And that was a great episode two. And then the other good episode was when we were on Boston, remember in Boston and Ari salt or Aryan Dunkin, they both sold to the audience to open up and they said backstage where we're auditioning for the Joe Rogan life stories that they're going to film. And we're looking for guys to play Joe Rogan. We want authentic guys from Boston. So the guys in the audience are thinking, Oh shit, they're auditioning to play for play. Joe Rogan. I think I could do. You could do it, honey, you can do it. So people lined up and we had a fake audition. Like I'm this bad. I probably shouldn't talk about this. Cause I think what you did was illegal was, yeah, I'm pretty sure we did. I'm sorry. Yeah, we probably just didn't really happen. We denied that. Yeah. Yeah. This, this is all in another dimension. We deny this. We deny this parallel university. Bravo does not seek to get suited this moment in time. This is all fiction. Dunkin was the director never happened. It never happened. This didn't take place. He can't timber saying it. Probably.

Speaker 1:          00:58:16       You just farted. No, I did not know. I smell it too. No, I did not. And we need some air conditioning happens. Did you fart? He wouldn't do that. What'd you, Eddie, listen, this is not helping the podcasts at all. Not one moment. Jewish. Sure. Seventies unfound double unfindable when we have it somewhere. Right. Did you Google it somewhere? Yeah. It's not even on googling, right. The, the, the, the location it was on. It was on your website. Do you have the raw video still? I'm sure I do. On batteries.

Speaker 4:          00:58:44       You might not have the chance that you'd lost that forever.

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       Uh, Brian, how sad. I really doubt it. Well, really, I have, I have, I've had a hard drive die on me reasonably. We need to find that man, because that was a, that was a classic for sure. Somebody saved it. It's got to be someone out there that say, I'm 100% sure I have it, but it's just finding it. Those are those things. Don't make me laugh anymore. Those tricking people, things like jackass type things. No, I shouldn't say jackass, like pumped type things. They don't make me laugh anymore. They used to make me laugh, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:59:20       Oh, this guy's getting fucked over. And like the Jamie Kennedy experiment, I thought that show was hilarious. Guy's gone nuts. Used to make me laugh. But now I don't want to watch that stuff. I don't want to watch people get lied to. I remember what what it is. I became a pussy. It became super sensitive. I don't like watching that. I'm like, you know, you're taking advantage of somebody for entertainment. That's not even

Speaker 2:          00:59:41       I like, I like my poo Barry flashlight joke that gets me every time somebody does that. That was not very fleshlight. Yeah. I told you this. I have a fleshlight at my house and then this guy gave me this thing called liquid ass.

Speaker 5:          00:59:53       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You could bury. You make people smell. You're fucked.

Speaker 2:          00:59:57       I don't make it. I'm just like, hey, you should try it. Got It. That new pair Coobury fleshlight smells like blueberries. That's not that funny. It is funny when you see him doing it though. I've seen it. I've seen it on video. You think in real life it's funnier just cause you get to watch the real sick. It makes me giggle. Smell making some, seeing somebody's face when they're smelling poop. Just make me laugh. That kind of shit. You used to take photos. It doesn't make me laugh as much anymore. The premise has got to be good. If there's a good promise, you can't just, it's gotta be deep and good and it's the best one recently is it? But you know Jason Tebow, his girlfriend Danielle, uh, she never did it, so she opened it up and she smelled it. She was like, oh that smells like a homeless person's underwear or something like that. And then I'm like, put your finger in it. And I had just poured a new fresh thing of liquid ass inside of it. So she puts her finger and gets all over her hand and her whole and was like poop.

Speaker 5:          01:00:45       You're 12 years old. This is 36 years old. Can you believe that? A 36 year old, 12 year old, let me see your Id. No. Aligna it's motherfuckers going to be dressing up like Winnie the Pooh next week, banging his girlfriend in a room full of strangers. She's going to be just up like a little Fox. Would you, would you admit though that that's going to be interesting to see? Oh yeah. Listen, I would go no doubt about it. Especially if, you know, I knew for sure that the crotch and the ass of mite thing was zipped up. Nobody could get at me. Right. You know? I would go, I would just think they'd be crazy though, man. I think they just do take shit to each other and they just like, it can get like really uncomfortable. I think some of them are probably pretty normal, but I think whenever you get an opportunity to completely pretend to be somebody else, you get to dress up in some outfit.

Speaker 5:          01:01:31       You don't even talk. Everyone agrees to not talk. You get to see like how wacky some minds are. Some people's brains are fucking fried, you know, and you, you kind of put yourself at the mercy of being around those people without being able to filter them socially. You know, if we're all sitting around talking after five, 10 minutes, we all kind of figured out how we're each others vibes coming from. Even like do something that surprises us. You know, you find out someone's a little weirder than you thought, but for the most part you get a kind of vibe and some people get a vibe immediately. Okay, I don't want to talk to that guy. Well, when that guy's dressed up like Wiley, coyote, you don't ever get that vibe.

Speaker 2:          01:02:05       Yeah, you're going to have that one Wiley, coyote guy walking around creeping everybody out. Maybe that's what excites them.

Speaker 5:          01:02:11       Fuck yeah, I bet a lot of them. Look, I think that would be like a great thing for a serial killer. A great thing for serial killer would be go and hang around with a bunch of other people that are dressing up like this fucking Weirdo outfit. You know this Weirdo animal thing and you could wear one of those weird animal things and just infiltrate them and then hang out with them and a way that other people are never willing to hang out with two bunnies. Serial killer. I don't like. I would assume that most serial killers like you are around them. You'd be tripped out by them. Like most of them. Like you would get a weird vibe from them. Most of them, right? Wouldn't you assume? I mean you think that serial killers would be able to just like sneak on by Ya or do you think you would get like a weird vibe from him?

Speaker 5:          01:02:48       I think I would definitely be able to get a weird vibe from somebody, but then of course I have no idea. You have no idea. Right. It's all speculation. A lot of friends, the more friends you have and the more people you come in contact with, you can spot those in a second. Like people that look at ideas all the time and spot them. Fake ones, good ones all day. Yeah. This one's different. It's different. It's not the same. Yeah, you're right. If you have a bunch of different friends and you run a bunch of people and if you're honest, that to me I think is the big one. If you're a real honest person and you're honest and the way you communicate with people, you can see you pick up deceptive behavior very quickly because it just seems off. You have your guard down, you're relaxed, you're open, and then you see something that's like just not quite real. I just something about what you're saying. It seems like bullshit. You know?

Speaker 2:          01:03:35       I think psychedelics also helps that sense too because you actually see the person's inner soul at certain points of doing psychedelics where you could see their energy and ever since he see that or that feel, that feeling, I think he kind of have that feeling in the back of your,

Speaker 5:          01:03:49       do you ever go to the movies when you're high? Yeah, of course. You know how when you can tell that they're acting bad. Dude, I want, I saw the hulk, the Eric Bana Hawk and Eric Ban is a great actor. Don't get me wrong, he's in the movie chopper. He's a bad motherfucker in that movie. But in the Hawk there was some scenes where you didn't really have much to do and it didn't seem like he was the most focused, you know, there's a few scenes where him and this chick or talking, and I'm listening to the two of them talking about like if this is so not real, like I remember in the movie theater going, this is like some of the worst acting ever. This is so fake it seems like, so you're not committed to what you're saying. You're not thinking about what you're saying, but it's because the weed that we just lets you tune into it, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:04:29       But it's, it's that way with the conversation too. You ever, you know, you've been high before when you, you feel like someone's lying to you and to you it feels like even more so, it's even more shocking and weird if you're, if you're vulnerable and you're, you know, a little high, maybe he had to touch a paranoia and then you realize it's someone's lying. He like, they just feels fucking gross. Yes, yes, yes it is. Thinking about bunnies or anything about that. I don't know how to break this to you though. But these are fake bro. Dude, dude, I got it from amazon.com okay. Guaranteed. It's legit. Get it from Peru. Conspiracy theory. Crystal Skull. That's big foot. Oh no big fuss on a battle on a man. You know there's an animal channel show right now. It's sort of finding big foot or something like that on the animal planet

Speaker 3:          01:05:19       or animal channel. I've seen the commercials because on one video was in Spokane this past weekend, and, and as we're landing on the Spokane airport, you know, you're, you're, you're looking at all like the forest and the pine trees and, and you know, I started thinking about Saas, squash them. Like, I'm going to ask the guys at my seminar what they think, you know. So in the beginning of summer, I go by show of hands, who believes in Sasquatch? Nobody to school. The Edy's running. This is how he starts off. I wanted to, I want them to know this. Nobody raised their hand. So I'm like, Shit, none of you guys believe in Sasquatches holy shits. I'm thinking right there. Okay. If these people live here in Spokane, small city in the woods, if they don't believe it, then a couple of guys start going, well, you know, you never know because of this one, because of I go, wait a minute. So you're saying you kind of believe it? And I go, okay, by show of hands, who thinks that maybe they exist? They all raised their hands. Whoa. They all I go, really? They just didn't want to raise their hands initially because they didn't want, you know, they would probably ridiculed in school. Well, here's some new, there's some

Speaker 5:          01:06:23       weird facts. First of all, there's 250 different native American names for Sasquatch, 250 different names for this big hairy man that lives in the woods and the pro primary, uh, the, the big predominant, you know, a group of sightings is in the Pacific northwest. You think if they had the internet back then one back then I won't be one name. Right. That's 250 people talked about it and they all made it their own name. Well, no, they had a bunch of different languages to squash the best. That's the Indian name. I Sasquatch. Like Henry. Yeah. Well, the, the, the reason why it's interesting is because so many different names exist for it because of there's no other, um, mythical creatures in the, uh, the, uh, native American, um, like, uh, I don't think they have like a mythology that has like maybe different Indians do and some of them do and some don't.

Speaker 5:          01:07:16       But for the most part, I don't think it's like, you know, the Greeks had all these fake gods and all these different, you know, the griffins and all these different things that they had created. There was obviously a lot of fiction going on. I don't think there's that much fiction in the native American folklore. So when there's all these different names for this one animal, it makes you go, hmm, maybe there was a thing like that at one point in time. And then there's so many fucking sightings of these things and that makes you go, hmm, maybe, well, what the fuck would it be? How could there be an ape that no one's ever heard of? Then you find out that it's not an ape. It's no one's ever heard of it. There actually was an eight foot tall, erect giant ape called Gi do epiphysis that actually lived in Asia and lived in Asia as recently as 100,000 years ago.

Speaker 5:          01:07:57       And they think that this thing may have calmed down the Bering Strait along with American or along with native Americans rather. When people first came to America, America 10,000 years ago, half of North America was under a mile high sheet of ice. So there was a connection actually between us and Russia and Asia and animals would come across that connection, the Bering strait. And that's how people supposedly got here. And they think that it's very possible that at one point in time, this now extinct animal that they know exists, made that trip as well. This animal, they say it's definitely existed. It wasn't 100% exists. It's called tall person or no, it's called gigantic [inaudible]. They have, um, they, they, they found this thing because they found an extraordinarily large tooth and a one of these Chinese market somewhere. And, uh, it was a tooth that they knew as a primate tooth, but it was so large they couldn't believe that, you know, it was a humans.

Speaker 5:          01:08:52       And so they've tried to figure out what it was early man, what the fuck it was. And then they found some other bones and then, uh, eventually discovered that there was an actual animal called gigantic epiphysis. Hmm. So what about the argument that you don't find bones are, you know, 500 errors either man, you don't find dead bears who wants the bone? If there's a small population of them, if there's a small population of them and one of them died, things that die, there's a video, a time lapse video of Africa, which is obviously much more predatory than the Pacific northwest. But in this time lapse video of Africa, an elephant dies and these hyenas start tearing this elephant apart. And even some, uh, some lions actually scavenged a little bit if the thing's gone and three days in 72 hours is gone. There's nothing, nothing exists.

Speaker 5:          01:09:39       And it's a fucking elephant cause hitting in the bone, everything, they're all just chewing everything up. They all just take things away. The hyenas cause smash bones, hyenas, they have like some of the most powerful bites in the animal kingdom. And the reason why is cause they're scavengers. They smashed bones and you know, bite off chunks of meat from the bones. I mean, those are just ruthless cont. They're just there. They're the fucking total cons of the animal kingdom. They're just mean, vicious fucking horrible animals that screech and laugh. And the females are larger than the males. The reason being is because the males are so evil. They eat their babies all the time. So to keep the males from eating the babies, the females have to be larger than the males. And the females have a fake Dick. They have a giant full penis and they mount the males and dominate them with this fake deck.

Speaker 5:          01:10:26       It's a giant like arm hanging from between their legs. It's the creepiest shit you've ever seen. This giant female who's bigger than the male humps the mail and dominates him. It's a matriarchal society. I want to fake Dick you, you kinda real one though. Brian went to, if you look up gigantic mythic as though they have skulls in this thing. I didn't even know about that. I thought it was just like a cave man. Well you know they don't have a full skull, you know, but they have enough that they piece together what it would look like. You know they have bones and various parts of jaws and second video that didn't exist anymore. They probably don't exist anymore. They probably did exist like maybe even just a few hundred years ago and they'd probably died off or there might be a few of them out there. It's really possible.

Speaker 5:          01:11:10       The thing if you went to Spokane, you know that as you fly over that Pacific northwest, it really occurs to you how fucking dense that shit is. There is so much forest up there. It's hard for you to wrap your head around. It's hard for you to wrap your head around over an hour of flying through the air and it's still forest and that's what it is up there. I mean in some dense dense shit. So if you think that they've absolutely done a a survey and an account of everything that lives in that forest, you're crazy. There's no way they have, they just killed the fucking a Jaguar or a panther rather in Connecticut. They thought that there was no panthers on the east coast for a long time. They, I think the last one I believed that killed a New Hampshire and like the 18 hundreds, you know the, when they, uh, the settlers first came to the east coast, they eradicated most of the mountain lions, but they just killed one in Connecticut, 140 pounder and they saw it.

Speaker 5:          01:12:03       There was a spotting of one in a New York 20 miles away from that could have been the same panther because they've known, they're known to travel like a hundred miles in a day sometimes. So it could have been the same panther that went 20 miles away. But you don't know where this thing came from. It could have been a pet, he could have been a pet, but it also could have been something that was living in the fucking woods. It's really possible. They did use to exist and there are so hard to find men. You know, I saw one where when I lived in Colorado, but you know, it's, it's fairly rare to see one, you know, I've talked to people who lived in Colorado for years. He never saw one, but there's plenty of people that have, but they've got a documented population of thousands of mountain lions up there.

Speaker 5:          01:12:43       You know, it's not like they're scarce, they're just kind of crafty. They're crafty animals and that's way more populated than the Pacific northwest. You know, if you're living in a place like, like you know, Spokane or, or any of those areas where they have those Sasquatch sightings, it's always like northern California. It's always like the rain forest man. There's some fucking sounds that these guys have recorded and it could be hoaxes, but people who have studied these sounds like primatologist have studied these sounds. They said their primate in nature, you know, they don't know what the fuck it is, but these guys are camping out in the woods and they hear these screams and he screeches and the night, who knows? The thing that has me curious is that there's an actual animal and there's pictures of this thing. Look at this. This is, this is a, it depends because I mean look at it.

Speaker 5:          01:13:27       It's God damn big foot man. I mean, the real animal is a big foot. It's an animal that absolutely existed that that hooks us based off of probably. It could be. They could be, it could be. It could very well be a hoax for sure. Or it could be, there's a big fucking ape out there, but the thing is, if it did exist, brow, here's the thing. If that fucking thing existed, it would be in a cage right next to the gorilla at the zoo and nobody would give a fuck. It's because it's a mystery that's so intoxicating to people. We have this weird thing where we want things that are secret. We want things that we don't know yet. Oh, I don't know. Is it real? Is it real? And we want to uncover these fucking secrets, his deep desire to do that more than to accumulate knowledge.

Speaker 5:          01:14:10       Like people have a much stronger desire to find secrets like ghosts or something retarded like that. Like who the fuck cares? It goes, have never killed anybody, you know, you know, you don't get anything from goes see, you know, you can't record them on film. Everybody that sees them, they all sound like they're full of shit. You know, you really believe in ghosts, man. You're going to dedicate your time to go say theirs. But I was going to say is when there's all this shit out there that is real and it's fascinating, some incredible shit, the discovery, you know, they believe that there may be small black holes traveling through our galaxy and that can pass right through the sun. That can go through the sun and we wouldn't even notice it. We would still be a little blip, little blip out there, and they would just pass right through the son.

Speaker 5:          01:14:52       They know that there's a fucking RV sides, uh, asteroids that just whizzed by our planet. Just the other day, just yesterday I think it was like really close between us and the moon went fucking flying by in the same orbit, the same place as satellites are. That's how close it was. It's RV sized. I mean, you know, that's pretty small as far as as far as asteroids go. But if it hit it hit a city or something like that. Yeah, but that would have gone through our r whatever atmosphere, atmosphere burnt out maybe. It depends on what it's made out of. They don't all burnout. The really scary ones. The ones that are made out of iron, you know, there's some, there's some that are made, I mean comments. When you see the trail of a comment that's cause it's mostly ice, you know, that's water.

Speaker 5:          01:15:33       That's w there's so much fucking water and comments at that trail is actually the, the water vapor like coming off this giant fucking hunk of ice. Those are not nearly as terrifying as the ones that are all iron. You know, the ones that are all water and all sorts of other other shit, you know, as they're getting close. A lot of it's going to go away. But you know, even when it blows up in the atmosphere, even when it erodes in the atmosphere, sometimes it still produces insane damage, man. Like there's an area of the Soviet Union that was hit by a meteor in, I think it was the turn of the century and it's called Tom Guskey, you know, that's the, uh, the area and there's photos of just flat and miles and miles of trees. I mean, it just as fucked, like they got hit by a nuclear bomb man and there was no actual asteroid. By the time it got to earth, it had been eaten up by the atmosphere.

Speaker 1:          01:16:25       Those fucking things are terrifying, man. I want to know if it goes kills that goes, then you die and you're on the same level as the go is, can you think kill that goes, then he goes into another ghost level. You mean if a ghost kills a person, you become a ghost. Can you check that? Go Sas for killing you? Yeah. And then you kill the ghostmen ghost world. You can't kill Gusto. Yeah, but so there was no dine in a movie. That's the thing about ghosts. That's so scary. You can like get rid of them. If you have a good priest, a good priest who loves his mother, but if you don't have that the fuck man, you can't even can't kill him. You have to be able to kill a ghost and the ghost level cause then that has to be a third ghost thing. You can't kill him, Bro. That goes level would be really crowded. Then it goes, who's that? They have to trick you on a dime. You have to like get scared and fall down flights, stairs and shit.

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       You have to get scared back up into an open elevator shaft. That's how ghosts kill you. They can't really do shit. They're just bluffers. You know what's funny? This goes hunters is a real TV show. It's about one one. This is like a bunch of his more than one too. There's a ton of ghost shows. There's a ton of go shows and they're all exactly the same. It's all three stupid white people and occasionally there's a black guy with glasses and they're in a basement and they have night vision on and then they go, did you hear that? Sh and they cut the commercial and then they play music and be like, why are you playing music? Cut that fucking music out. And then they edit. There's nothing to see here. That's the thing about it goes. There's nothing to see here to fucking look all day. No one's the most you have is like some weird image, you know whispery image and again, it's only interesting because it's unknown. It's only interesting because people think there might be ghost might be real into secret thing. It might be real crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       It all depends on what you define as a ghost. You know, something that isn't in this plane or whatever. But you know when you, you talk science, the smartest motherfuckers that have ever lived with a Nazi scientists, they are invented missiles that were so far ahead of everyone else. Tech in science and technology. Those was good. You know what I'm saying? Like when they went down, Russians raced in a, took half their scientists. The Americans took the other scientists.

Speaker 5:          01:18:33       Yeah. A lot of people don't even know that. Our space program is based entirely on Nazi sign. Never the smartest motherfucker, Wernher von Braun, and they were

Speaker 1:          01:18:40       down this, I mean,

Speaker 5:          01:18:43       to ancient aliens. I don't know. According to age, that is maybe the worst reference you could ever say. It's like according to Wikipedia, you are a fucking skull and bones. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm very excited about it. No, I am me nice. He's a nice guy. I liked the guy because it's, it's, it's a show. It's an entertainment. Show me talks about Atlantis maybe being a spaceship that flew off in this guy. Of course. Maybe it's a rabbit in an eight, a giant magical carrot and that created the end of the Atlantic and empire. Yes, I did. It was fascinating. It was fascinating. The actual facts of what the Nazis were into and a lot of what they are into is like ancient Hindu scriptures, like the vimanas. They studied all these, you know, vimanas were like these flying things in ancient Hindu scriptures that from thousands and thousand years ago, these flying ships that people have always tried to interpret like, what the fuck did they mean by this?

Speaker 5:          01:19:34       You know, and the, the, the Nazi scientists were fascinated by all that stuff. They were very much into the cult and very much into a, you know, the idea of ancient knowledge. And you could throw that aside and say they were silly if it wasn't for the incredible technological capabilities that they had back then. BMW, that was, those were, they made engines for Nazis. Man. I mean Volkswagen, that's the car for the people, you know, there was, there was so much, they made incredible rockets there. Rocketry was so far ahead of anything and the rest of the world they were, they were the innovators when it comes to the, the field of, of

Speaker 4:          01:20:07       rocketry and space travel, pop Warner, von Braun. Yeah. Warner von Braun and Hermann Oberth are both quoted as saying all that technology came from help from beans, from another solar system. It never channeling, never channeling information. Yeah. To build UFL is they built four different models of UFS and they're saying they were getting the information antigravity information by the virtual society, which Hitler was a part of and they were running the Nazis, the rural society. And it was all based on channeling from another solar system that there were this, this chick, I forget her name, Maria. Oh, stitch was the head out of medium and she was channeling ancient Sumerian tax. And then they bring in a, uh, a dude who can transcribe it. She had no idea what she was writing. It was an ancient Sumerian text and there's instructions on how to build Ufo. They built four of them.

Speaker 4:          01:21:01       It's on record of Honeboo one Honolulu to Honolulu three. They built you elbows and they're saying they build space ships, they build Ufo. Well, you have photos are unidentified. Yeah, well yeah, they belt antigravity. So a lot of the, the sightings in the forties and fifties, and probably even to today are all based, or not all, but I'm sure a lot of them were German Ufo. When they say that they build something that's antigravity that can't really be proven because we can't do antigravity today. Right. So because we can't do antigravity, we don't have a working model that they actually had that we could fly around in. A lot of that is speculation, but we do know that they were coming up with some weird shaped aircraft. I mean, some photos of them with these saucer looking a Nazi ships, like actual undisputable photos. They didn't fly.

Speaker 4:          01:21:50       Who knows? Who knows if the flu or not? I don't know. Do you know that they didn't find it did fly me back then that for models? Well they had planes, man. I mean, they could, they could make one of those fucking things flying the jet engine, you know, I don't know if it would, uh, obviously it would be any good. I mean, it might suck. Maybe that's why they stopped using it. There's a funny picture online of a Adolf Hitler with, uh, with an alien. I think he's just in the center then. Adolf Hitler. Dude, don't even say shit like that on my podcast pitch. This don't, you didn't pay attention to what's happened to fucking Tracy Morgan. Just talking about Charlie Chaplin. There's a, there's all these weird photos. Are these fucking these things at the Nazis built? Man, I wouldn't know how many of these photos are hoaxes and how many of them are legit, but it's a pretty fascinating man. It's, to me the most fascinating part is that they were using mediums to channel aliens from another rep and how do we know that? That's true. Is that an ancient aliens then? It was probably the u s government. Yes. What are you doing? What am I looking for? The, what's the size of royal society? Spell that. R. I. L so sorry.

Speaker 2:          01:22:57       Yeah, it makes me wonder if maybe they were just really dumb. Yeah. He's like, yeah, we're talking to aliens and, but they were really talking to our government and we're like, oh yeah. Well, yeah. Well, you know, you can poo

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       poo all you want. The idea of secret societies, but the bottom line is almost every single fucking president has been a part of one of those fucking things in high school or in college. Rabbit's gone. Bullshit is so disturbing that these people get together in college and decided to run shit based on, you know, this, this bond that they make when they're in college. But it completely makes sense if you pay attention to how people operate, man. Especially if you could, I mean, the best way to keep something secret really keeps something secret is to have a bunch of people who belong to some exclusive group and they won't rat anything out. You know, it's like, like, like a, a group of buddies who will talk about man law. Like, you know, you don't say shit about nothing, nothing to, you know, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

Speaker 6:          01:23:47       I mean that's, this is that on a huge level, you know, skull and bones is basically what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas on the biggest level possible, raping the world, causing wars, doing all this crazy shit and doing it under this premise of we're all a part of this group that agrees to be running the world in secret. What happens in Iraq stays in Iraq and they put in, they're asking, they're asking each other to join this thing and so to join it, they make them do some really embarrassing shit. Like, you know, you hear different stories from Soc Cox to let guys piss in their mouth or to all sorts of weird shit and they get it all on film. And this is how you become a member in this, this group. Everyone has to do these things, dress up like a diaper, let dude shit in your hair like that.

Speaker 6:          01:24:27       Just the most fucked up thing possible. And they film it so that they always have you. Yeah, but who the fuck knows? That sounds like, that sounds like some shit that you're saying in your mom's basement and there's like wood paneling on the wall and you're doing bong rips like dude. And then they totally make you eat shit. Really? Yeah, man. So my cousin said, my cousin said that was real. Eddie likes super eight. It was all right. Yeah. That's how I felt too. People got mad at me. We talked about last week I gave some spoilers away. I would see it. I'd see it again. I mean if I didn't know any better, if I, if I didn't know that the plot, I would go see it. It's a fun ride. The fat kid is a great actor of all those kids are pretty amazing.

Speaker 6:          01:25:05       They were good. Elliot to his Gig, they're probably going to be spectacular. Fuckups later in their life bank on them. They're probably going to be amazing. They're probably going to be Macaulay Culkin, ask it. Just kind of, they're all going to be on Dr drew show. Have you watched the new episodes? Joey Diaz swears it's the best of celebrity rehabs I noticed. I don't know. I looked at my DVR the other day. There was a couple of them, so I was like, oh Jesus, here we go again. Lindsay Lohan, his dad's on it, and Amy Fisher. Is He really? Amy Fisher, the WHO got famous by shooting someone. She's on it. She's a celebrity. She shot married Joe Butter Fuko in the fucking face and that made her celebrity. That's hilarious. What kind of a weird world we live in and man, where every fucking show is real housewives and teen moms and mob wives and auto. Fuck are we doing man, you want to see real shit. That's not even real shit. We want to size UFC and all reality shows. That's like real shit. We don't want to see fighting movies but out a fighting movie. Most of those reality

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       shows are bullshit. You know that as much. But we think it's real. Most people think it's real. You know what I think it is? I think our lives are becoming more and more complex and people are more and more stressful and they have more and more real problems and they want to be distracted with a problem that they could focus on that they have absolutely no stake in. So they could watch people with their drama and getting mad at each other and crazy and screaming and this girl was fucking his wife and he's going fucking crazy and they're going bankrupt. But meanwhile, you personally have zero stake in it, so you can sit there and watch it and get totally caught up in it and you know and you don't. Your life doesn't fall apart. It's like Cathartic. Yeah, makes sense. Totally makes sense, right?

Speaker 5:          01:26:42       Yup. That's what I think is going now. This is, if you want real proof that there's an apocalypse coming down, it's what the fuck is on TV. That's the real proof. The real proof is mob wives. The real proof is real housewives of New Jersey. You Watch these morons living, they're retarded life. They're non introspective, no common sense. Not Thinking Ego testicle under the microscope and can't handle it. The spotlight's on them. They don't know what the fuck to do. They're acting crazy and here their nonsense talking. That's, that's the, that's the sign. That's a sign. It's all going down. That's the sign. Eddie Bravo. You know what? We should do Joey's shit. We should try to get tickets to that comic continents coming out. Fuck yeah. I would love to go down there and start some shit. We should speak. Speak at comic con about podcasts, like we're experts, we should speak.

Speaker 5:          01:27:28       Somebody asked me to speak at the zeitgeists movement. This is like guys thing. Uh, September 11th, 2011. There's the you want to grow, they want to go that, I don't know, it's an la, there's a series of them. It's like guys, the media event, they asked me to speak in it, which I'm down. But the problem is meant with, with all of these things, whenever you claim that you fucking got the answers. All right. Whether it's just like guys throw, whether it's Scientology or whether it's, I don't want to equate zeitgeisty Scientology, but it's too late already. Did they? They don't have the answers, man. And everybody's saying, you know, like, like if you, if you look at a, there's a, there's a website called zeitgeists debunked and you know, there's a lot of shit that they got wrong, man. Just straight wrong. Of course. When it comes to, even when it comes to the way they were backing up the, um, the, uh, the, the, uh, the, the history of, um, of, of religion.

Speaker 5:          01:28:19       They got all these, these things wrong with Mithra and all that and it's, it's been corrected on all these different websites, all the things that they got incorrect about, but they're so confident in these points of view that they can put these points of view out. No, no, no, no, not at all. No. I was like, can I see, it's pretty interesting. There's a lot of this, like I said, I've been nine one one, right. It's a lot of, it's nine one, one in the area and also I have a problem with it where there's, there's things when they talk about the towers and how the towers fell. I just farther this time, this time was, was me. That was me. If you smell as far, don't run away, Brian. Don't be scared. Anyway, the, uh, you're a, you're using this as an excuse to get up.

Speaker 5:          01:28:55       Did you fart? No, I did. I actually just had to go to the bathroom and they said it wasn't even bad, but I'm just, um, in so many didn't own up for the last one. I felt like I should only have it a smart man. Okay, man. Maybe it was Brian. Maybe it was thing my cat's in here somewhere. And by the way, she took a nasty shit and that litter box in the bathroom, it might be that walk out here. What percentage is explosive and which percentage of solid loaves? Well, I've been eating a lot of lettuce lately and I've also been drinking this new thing. Uh, this, this, um, this vegetable drink. It's amazing, man. I got this Vitamix, you know Kevin James loss 80 fucking pounds, right? Kevin look great dude. His face skinny, he looks so healthy. It looks like vibrant. It's crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:29:35       And he got on Chubby at all while he's still got a gut. He still, he look dude, he was 300 fucking pounds. He's got extra skin, you know, but he's in way better shape then. Awesome. Almost since I met him, I met him in 91, maybe somewhere around then. And this is about as healthy as I've ever seen him as far as like his diet and what's what he's doing. And he got this Vitamix thing and he swears by it, man. He's like, he's like, he told me about this book, some woman wrote this book on on, you know, how are you supposed to eat vegetables? And that, the problem is, you know, your, your body spent so much time digesting food and breaking food down that it causes a lot, uses up a lot of energy. So she has this, um, she tells you to take this blender and you blend all your vegetables together.

Speaker 5:          01:30:15       So I blend like Kale and I blend cucumbers and I blend like a pear and in some, some, some, um, some ginger and some celery, a bunch of shit together into this drink that looks like the hulks loads. That's what it looks like, just as green crazy drink. And I drink this shit and first of all, my shit, full clothes out of me like a river. No, nicely, just nicely. Just slides out like, like if you were logging on a river and it was a nice strong current to the river and you unloaded a whole truckload of, of logs into this river to take them down hill. And then he just went, ah, just traveled down hill. That's what it's like when I take a shit. My, my logs just traveled down hill. Ah Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So it comes out nice.

Speaker 1:          01:31:00       You don't ever have explosive. No, no, no. That's probably Mexican for the 5% much time. You know what that is 100% that what that is, it's a food allergy. A, you should get tested with food allergies, cell test, everything and give you a percentage up and down that how allergic you are at that rate of explosive shit. It's food hours. You'll be surprised your body. Cause it's after I eat. Yeah. Yeah. It's probably most likely bread. I bet you have a food allergy to bread and it might not be like you can't eat bread, but definitely be talking to the microphone more. So I think a lot of people have a analogy to gluten. Jeff, Jeff's wife has me. That's exactly what it probably is. Yeah, it's a real common one. Apparently it's not that good for your body to be eaten bread. Apparently bread, even though it fills you up, you know, bread, you know as great for poor people. You know, you take your wheat and you make your bread and it fills your belly and it gives you carbohydrates. Apparently you body doesn't like breaking it down, especially processed white flour. Apparently that's just just glue. You know? It's just like funky glue like you're supposed to eat. Like Ezekiel bread, like Ezekiel bread is really good for you. I love that shit. I have zeal bread with peanut

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       butter in it. I don't even feel like I'm doing anything bad. You know? I don't feel like if I have a peanut butter and Jelly Sandwich on whole wheat bread, I'm like, how much sugar is in this man? This is all sugar, you know? But if I have like some a Zico bread with some natural peanut butter, I don't feel bad at all. It's terrific for all the time. Great. Can we have a moment of silence for Fogo de Chao? I love that place. Oh, what fun is silence. Why don't you fucking go, there's one in Los Angeles. I was going to say, I went there two days ago. Did you guys, we need to do another desk squad trip there. This is what we're going to do folks. We're going to take a trip to the salt and sea. Eddie and I talked about it as soon as he showed up.

Speaker 5:          01:32:31       I got a book here on the salt and sea and I got to documentary sitting on my desk because being the retard that I am, whenever a subject comes up on the podcast or that I get up said hip too, um, I, I get fascinated by it and the salt and sees the thing that I've been so I'm so fascinated by it lately. And apparently Eddie says that Sonny Bono was the guy that was trying to save the salt and sea trying to bring it back and apparently it can be brought back. Yeah, it could be according to the documentary they, which documentaries this is it any of those? This one plagues and pleasures of the salt and seeing plagues and pleasures of the salts. And isn't that a John Waters documentary? I'm not sure, but it's amazing. It is. Gotta see that them pleasures on the salt and sea.

Speaker 5:          01:33:07       Yeah, I just received it because somebody sent me hip to a, a video online. They linked it to me on Twitter and I tweet retweeted it. Yeah, it quite open it. It was a while back, maybe a couple of weeks ago. And uh, I watched this video online about this ocean inside, I mean almost like an ocean that's huge. Manmade Lake inside of California's coast. And I was like, what the fuck? This is nuts, man. And then it talks about how toxic it became because of the runoff from all these different farms and that it got saltier and saltier. The point where like a lot of the animals of the fish just fucking died. And these people still live there and in the city got flooded, flooded. That's what fucked everything. Okay. And when you see it, man, you're like, what the fuck? It looks like like some crazy, it looks like some Mad Max shit like we were talking about.

Speaker 5:          01:33:52       It looks like Armageddon. Yeah, so we're going to do a desk squad photo shoot from out there. That's what we do live there. Yeah. There's 400 people that live there. That's incredible. It's cheapest. Fuck. You can buy a house for our property for like man, it's, it's a, it was a three it was probably $3,000 a month. You can buy a lot time. Does it take to drive out there? It takes about two hours. We should build a death squad studio at the salt and sea. Just do once a month salt and see shows. If I buy a house for 300 or 3000 bucks, you could probably buy 300 might be 300 but I think it's 3000 some of the people that they showed that live there, it's seriously, they're like crazy homeless people like meth heads. Well that's okay as long as we don't leave any equipment behind. But what if we like have a place and we set it up, we get some couches in there and shit, get an internet connection, bring our laptops so we don't really have to have equipment there. Bring our laptops and our mixer set that shit up and do like a weekly or a monthly show from the salt and sea. It's scary. Salty. I mean there was a thriving many French Riviera right in

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       California, two hours away. Jack the, I think it's the biggest manmade lake in the country. Yeah. And it's the biggest body of water in California. It was thriving in the 50s all the, they were building all these condos and houses. People were moving out there. It was amazing. They're like fuck palm springs, you ain't got no Goddamn Lake. They were going and salt and sea and then they had a big flood. Like the levees broke and all this shit cause was all manmade, flooded, everything out. People freaked out. And there's still people today that are living there that were there waiting for it to come back. They were back. They all, they remember the good old days. Wow. And it's dark. It's like, uh, it's like, um, it's really is a ghost town. It reminds me of like California. Remember Brad right

Speaker 5:          01:35:40       head and uh, and David Duchovny. Remember the whole, yeah. Cal California ghost towns like this. I'll do you've juke driven from California to Vegas before you've done that, right? Did you go with me? We drove and you and me and Dimitri and we stopped off in one of those little ghost towns where they had like a fake gun fight. Do you remember that Shit that was happening? It wasn't, you know, it was, it was me, Dimitri. Then we were headed to Vegas to see the k one that we went to one with a couple of times. We did a case that we did a couple of k one trips. Yeah. Well back then there was no UFC in Vegas is so old school were going, there was no UFC in Vegas. So Eddie and I would want to go see fights. We'd have to go see k one Vegas.

Speaker 5:          01:36:22       Scott Coker used to promote k one and Vegas and it's got hardly no one there. It's tiny little ballroom. The Bellagio. A ballroom. It was as big as are tough enough is, yeah, just like that. Exactly. We'll tell people don't know what tough enough. It's tough. And I was a local amateur show in Vegas and we would go down there and there'd be, you know, a few hundred people and you'd get to see fucking Peter Arts, Peter Arts, fos, Stefan Leco, you know like high level top of the food chain. K One guys. We're going at it, man. It was some great fucking fights. The K K one in Vegas was awesome. They should bring that back. I tried to talk to Dana about that. I tried to take, dude, man, maybe you should fucking get involved in k one k one in. I'm telling you to think about what's the most exciting aspect of the UFC.

Speaker 5:          01:37:02       It's striking, right? You get the best strikers in the world. Look, I love watching Abu Dhabi. I love watching Marcello Garcia and and Pavel Popovich go after it. I love watching Chaco Ray and Hodgett Gracie go after it in in Abu Dhabi because they're the elite of the elite grapplers. I also like watching elite of the elite strikers, you know, in just straight up striking. There's a lot of guys, you don't get to see their full striking skills in the UFC because they're always worried about getting taken down. They're always worried about getting submitted. They're always worrying about, you know, dealing with certain things. So it's hard for them to relax and just get into the striking. But if you watch like that k one max, you ever watched that Shit Dude? I'll be honest with you man. I try to watch it. It's hard to watch it. Is it really? Yeah. I'm not that into it, man. I tried to, maybe it's because you don't have a striking background man. Maybe that's what it is to me. It's exciting. It's fuck. That's all I watch when I watch a fights, when I have the garage and I'll have the set up in the garage. When I work

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       out all, I watched the k one Max I saw. It's hard for me. [inaudible] fights. I watched up crazy motherfucker. Those fights are wild dude. All that fucking just straight stand up man. When their leg kicking the shit out of each other and flying knees and Tude you can, you can't wash that. That doesn't just an extension. I want to, I want to like it, but it's boring as hell. Wow. That's so weird. I want it. It's gotta be, because that's not your background because it's like, look, I like watching pool. I watched professional pool. I've got hours of pool on my laptop. I got like maybe 10 15 hours of pool matches on my laptop at any given time. So if I'm ever in an airport by myself, Ooh, I'll watch Mika eminent play F and Reyes and I'll sit there and watch a pool match that I already know that the, the result.

Speaker 4:          01:38:36       Got It. You got to be God that wants it happily. If I'm gonna watch striking, it's gotta. It's gotta. There's gotta be a threat of the fight going to the ground. I mean, really, if I'm going to watch striking, it's going to be check Congo and Pat Barry. That's what I'm going to watch. You know what I mean? Right. There's a threat of going down there on the floor. They didn't stop it. I mean that fight could have been stopped two different times easily. Was that not the craziest end of a fight you have ever seen? Ever? This is the greatest comeback in the history of combat sport. I was watching it with a friend who doesn't train. He'd done it. He didn't, he was just telling me right before the match. He goes, I hate it when people, when a fighter hurts another fighter and he goes down and then he jumps in his guard and then strives to knock them out.

Speaker 4:          01:39:17       Why doesn't he just let them get up and stand up? I go, well a lot of times when a guy has hurt, he throws hay makers and, and if you catch one of those haymakers while you think you have him hurt so many fights can just turn it at the blink of an eye. You want to get them, you know your natural instinct is, I got them hurt. Let me put them in a spot where there's no way he's gonna knock me out. Exactly. So people just, that's a natural instinct. I got you hurt. Let me ground and pound you now and I know for sure that there's even strikers do that all the time, man. Yes, exactly. They get on the wrong side. They'll climate guys guard and we were just talking about that and it happened. Yeah. Yeah. Pat Barry would have just took him down and pounded them on the ground.

Speaker 4:          01:39:54       That wouldn't have happened. Did you ever see a Diego corrals and a Castillo? No. You never saw that fight? It was the boxing equivalent to that. Jose Luis Castillo and Diego corrals, dio corrals was fucked up. He was getting dropped and battered look at the fight was almost stop, Bang. He connects and corrals goes out. It was just like that. I mean almost except there was knocked down and they counted. The excitement level of this was higher because there was no counting, you know, it was like the fight was almost over at any second. And literally Dan Merch Leon, I got on top of them was going to touch them and stopped the fight. Like he had his hands over them to stop the fight. But then check Congo went for a single and he changed his mind like a brilliant decision and a lot of people said, oh you should have stopped that fight the fuck they should have stopped that fight. Luke, who won? He won by knockout. There's no way he should have stopped his fight. He still wanted to fight. He still could to fight. He still could win and he did win. So there's no way they should have stopped that fight early on. It was the absolute perfect stoppage. You look, you just know you had to stop the once Pat Barry

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       was out cause Pat Barry was unconscious. That's why I hate early stoppages. Let them take an extra shot. They, they understand the danger they're in there cause they're crazy freaks. I do. I agree with you. You don't like he seen a guy getting blasted when he's already hurt because I know what it does to them. I know the physiological effect. Did you see, hey, pull this up man. Pull this up. Roy Jones Jr can't say spectacular Po. You're going to listen to this man. This is traveling all over the Internet. This is a really uncomfortable thing. I saw it on my headphones. Yeah, you'll see it. You're hearing in your headphones. You don't have to see it because it's just Roy Jones doing commentary and he can't say the word spectacular. You know, he just got knocked the fuck out by a Russian guy. Yeah. Russian guy battered him and the 12th round just like I thought it knocking you out. You know it's all listen to play it, play it. And this is, this is going to freak you out. I listened to Roy Jones. It's, she's starting to slip. Listen to this, we're going to it

Speaker 8:          01:41:52       this region and it's country short Straw. We sit and he's different slick tech because he has typical here. Wow, that's great. Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:42:08       Has he been at the beginning? If you see it on video it's even more noticeable. Like he really was. Yeah. And you know, what's, what's dark about it all man, is that Roy Jones was the guy who never wanted to get hit or Jones was the guy who never wanted to fight really dangerous fighters because he was always worried about brain damage cause he was buddies with Gerald Mcclellan. Gerald Mcclellan was one of the best fucking middle weights and light heavyweights ever. John McClellan was a fucking animal, but in his prime he got in a fight with Nigel Benn and he cut a lot of weight for that fight. And during the fight the fight was ugly and he blasted Nigel Benn in the first round. But Nigel Benn had Matt Hart and Nigel Benn Hung in there and was there and the second and third and they, they fought like dogs, dude. And they headbutted and they clashed heads.

Speaker 5:          01:42:52       And at one time Nigel Benn and him clashed heads after Nigel Benn was jacking them with some punches. Like they were just, they were just going after it, man. And he, Gerald Mcclellan took a knee, he went down and took a knee and then quit and then sat down was corn and there was like, Whoa, what the fuck is going on? And then he just collapsed. Like he was obviously done like he was, his brain was starting to bleed and he had realized that something was terribly wrong. So we tried to like, you know, stop. You started to try to sit down. Like there's so much that a guy like him who's a, just a, a furious killer watch like the Gerald McClellan, Gillian Jackson fight, Julian Jackson rather if you want to see some, some crazy barbaric, top of the food chain, KL, KL, action boxers going at it because Julian Jackson was like one of the hardest punchers ever and Gerald Mcclellan fucked him up and it's a crazy fight.

Speaker 5:          01:43:37       It's a fun boxing fight to watch. But so Roy Jones jr saw that man and never wanted to be that guy. He was always scared that he would be lecture on McClellan man. He was always scared that he would have some serious brain damage and he would get really badly hurt. So he never took any damage. He fought so smart in his reflexes were so good up until he fought Antonio Tarver. He never really got fucked up and then he beat John Ruiz. He went all the way up to heavyweight and who knows what he did to get to heavyweight cause he was like 200 pounds and shredded and that's not normal. Usually when you do that you're doing some sort of testosterone or something. You're taking something and when a lot of people don't realize, especially like fighters, they don't know who to turn to. They get their advice from, you know, from either shitty doctors or they get their advice from bodybuilders that are their friends or something like that.

Speaker 5:          01:44:22       What what people don't understand about hormones is if you join your body, you make your body like a hyper testosterone levels where they're far above normal. What happens is afterwards your shit crashes. So when you get off this testosterone, if you take some crazy amount of, of, of testosterone in your system, your ball shut down. So you need double the time that you were on that shit to recover. So say if you went on a cycle and you were Roy Jones, this is hypothetically speaking and decided to gain 20 pounds of muscle. If you are on a cycle of steroids for three months, you need six months just to get your shit down to a normal level again. You're, you're shit, it's fucked up man. Your balls aren't working anymore. You're doing something that your body's not supposed to have you, but he's not supposed to have these levels in it.

Speaker 5:          01:45:04       And so when your body has those levels, it's shuts off natural production and it takes a while for that shit to kick back in. And if you watch the difference between Roy Jones, his body from the Antonio Tarver fight to the genre Weise fight, the genre is fight. He fought at heavyweight and the next fight is at light heavyweight. And he was like smooth. It looked like you had no muscle tone. It just didn't look good man. And he did. He looks slow and Antonio Tarver knocked him the fuck out and there was a first time you ever got knocked out. And, and from that point on it was all downhill. And then he fought Glenn Johnson and Glen Johnson fucked him up. Glen Johnson knocked him unconscious, dead, stiff legged, you know, just eat, you know that arms up in the air when they're just out cold like that. Glen Johnson did that to him.

Speaker 5:          01:45:45       And then ever since then, man, it's been a slow slide. You know, he fought scared against Hopkins. He didn't, it didn't go after Hopkins. He just was happy to win a decision or happy to rather to lose a decision and did not get knocked out. He never tried to win that fight. You know, Hopkins was just too good for him and you know, and then he fought that guy, Danny Green and Australia. He got knocked out in the first round and then he fought this Russian dude and got knocked the fuck out in the last round and it was ugly dude. He froze up like halfway, like like was crumbling and the referee, the guy looks at the referee and the referee wouldn't stop it, so he goes, all right, pop bang while he's crumbling while like Roy Jones essentially slowly crumbling. This dude tees off with two full power shots and he face plants of completely unconscious and so then he goes on HBO a couple of weeks later and he can't say spectacular.

Speaker 5:          01:46:34       We are, we are watching the slow slide. We are watching everything that that guy was terrified of when he was a 20 year old phenom when he was on top of the world. Lighten people up. What about that rap song that he did? Can we do put it? You've got to talk into the microphone. We can't that you know that. Yeah. That's all. Must've forgot. Yeah, we need to see. We need to hear that. Yeah. No, I don't think we can man. But now that we're on a serious, we're on Sirius satellite radio. We're not allowed to play music anymore at all. He gets sued. You see this shit? Yeah. The Nebraska power plant is about to get fucking flooding here.

Speaker 2:          01:47:04       Here's a question. Why? Why do we get the pictures? Obviously they've have flooding problem

Speaker 5:          01:47:10       show Eddie that photo because it's just a trip to see the photo. It's a nuclear power plant, Bro. Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:47:15       Why isn't there a wall at least the size of maybe 10 times the height of the current wall around the whole entire place if it's near water or the ability to get flooded?

Speaker 5:          01:47:26       Well, there's a lot of floods going on, man, that nobody ever anticipated. You know what we're finding out right now with Japan and what we're finding out with this as well is there's, there's not, they didn't do a whole lot of what ifs when they built these fucking things, right. You know, they, first of all, they don't have any options to shut them down if they don't have any power. When they lost the backup generators in Japan and every got everything got flooded out by the tsunami, they had essentially they had eight hours before the thing started melting down. They're fucked. There's no way to stop it. They made these crazy things. He's fusion or fission reactors whenever they are fusion or fission. Which one is it? Nuclear fusion. I think it's fusion, fusion, whatever the fuck it is. This incredible amount of energy in this one, you know, one isolated area and they can't stop it.

Speaker 5:          01:48:07       They don't know how to stop it. Those, the what's going on in Japan right now, man, the Michio Kaku just wrote a really fascinating and terrifying article about it, about how the three complete meltdowns in the, in those plants in Japan and you know, there's people online that are in denial about this. For some reason, like someone in my mess, my message board was, you know, a thread about this was like, oh, you know, you're giving out misinformation about your parents. Not that bad. Like the fuck. It's not man. There's video online on Youtube of people that live miles and miles away that have taken Geiger counters and they walk around with a Geiger counter on and then they take the guy your counter and they put the Geiger counter on the ground. And that's when it's fucking terrifying because in the air, when you walk it around it looks like, yeah, it's a little radiate radioactive, but not too bad.

Speaker 5:          01:48:48       But then when you put the fucking thing on the ground is a couple of videos like this. You see the, the fucking levels are off the charts like way into the levels where people aren't supposed to be anywhere near Harris. Yeah. And it's on the ground, man. It's on the fucking ground because that's where apparently the, the, all the radioactivity collects, it collects on the ground. So this guy takes this re this Geiger counter and puts it on the ground. So I'm freaking out, man. So I bought some Geiger counters on Amazon and try to buy some Geiger counters it. Yeah. Especially after we had the conversation about Rocketdyne Rocketdyne, which is only, you know, fucking 10 miles from here. Something like that. It had a total meltdown supposedly in the 50s that's probably where the zombies would start. Right? In Japan. Yeah. Dude, I think we should do what Japan is just to help those fucking people that are anywhere near that place. Help them get out and then use that as a place to store the world's garbage. That place idea. Your idea. I've been saying that on stage for weeks. Page.

Speaker 2:          01:49:40       Yeah, and I said, I'm the one that said that like dare you like to pump podcasts ago. I said that. I was like, we should use nuclear places to put our trash.

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       You don't remember that dude. I send that to you. Think you said that before me. Yeah. Yeah, I did, but no, it's not. Not before me. Before I saw it on stage and brought 100% I dumped that bitch. No, cause when I said you're like, that's actually a really good idea. He might be right now that I think about it. Either way. It's a perfect idea. It's a perfect idea. Yeah. I think it's an awesome, whoever's idea it was. Maybe it was yours. I smoke too much weed. If it was your idea, right. And then Joe Zombies Zombie was a movie right there. A spot where we could just dump garbage, garbage right into the whole of it. Fly over in a helicopter and just drop it right into the, what would happen? Well hopefully this a, what is that thing called? That's making a black hole, hopefully turns into a really bad black hole.

Speaker 5:          01:50:25       And then we can just put the garbage on the black hole, the large hadron collider so we could litter litter in other galaxies. It's terrible. I D [inaudible] crying, you know, they have hyper Novas in space. They find these hyper knows that are there basically these uh, these like really super powerful knows that I have these jets of energy spraying out in either direction. What if that was garbage? What if we got like really close? We saw like cans and shit and rubbers and it turns out that all that shit spring out was the garbage of another dementia. They had figured out how to launch all of their garbage with a rocket ship into black holes. The planets all clean, super clean like that. Walk around with a portable like connection to that black hole. I saw. Another thing that I see and I'm going to report on this cause this is number nine for me.

Speaker 5:          01:51:12       This is the ninth time I've seen this. A fucking guy in a Prius throwing a cigarette out the window. God Damn, that drives me crazy. This motherfucker pulled into a organic foods parking lot of an organic food store, gets out of his Prius and throws his fucking cigarette on the ground. I'm like, you cunt. You dumb, dumb, dumb cunt. You stupid. Fuck what? What kind of a person goes so far to think they're helping the environment by buying a Prius. He had a ponytail on so he's like, I'm living natural. I'm going to go get some natural organic food and I'm just going to throw my cigarette right there, king of the hill episode. Did it really do and I can get the hell. He started working at a whole foods and it's similar to that. Didn't throw cigarettes out the window at whole foods.

Speaker 5:          01:51:57       They had Prius's and never, ever just constantly contradicting themselves. Well, it's people, man. I've seen nine times now, nine times. I've seen a guy in a Prius throw a cigarette out the window. Nine over the course of my entire life. This is the ninth guy. I've been documenting them. The last one was in San Francisco, the last one in San Francisco. I saw two in a weekend. I was there. I was there Thursday through Sunday working at Cobbs and I saw two guys in their fucking Prius's throw cigarettes out the window. That's incredible. It's incredible. Videotape it. Put It on, you know, do you never know to have your fucking camera? How like there's a kind of Prius, let's follow him and smoking. I know he's got this. Fuck, he's going to throw it out the fucking window. Gizmodo also has a article about LSD being used to treat what they call suicide headaches, which are people that have really bad headaches to the point where they almost to kill themselves, like

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       migraines times a billion. Right? So these two psychiatrists have been, uh, giving Lsd to these patients. And I think they said like almost all the patients, uh, all six patients reported decrease in the number of cluster attacks and fives have this effect lasted four months after they had taken LSD.

Speaker 5:          01:53:04       Well, if they had the right dosage of Lsd, if you could administer it in a laboratory and you knew exactly what you were getting. There was an article really recently that said that Mtma, which is ecstasy and Lsd, let's beautiful, far, far closer to being, uh, available for prescription than anybody would really imagine really far closer.

Speaker 2:          01:53:22       I tell you, man, that is one of the most beautiful drugs in the road. Credible Molly, pure ecstasy or whatever it is. I can't get enough of it. But what's weird, it's recently I bought some ecstasy and I didn't feel the same. I've normal XSD feeling. And you came in and talking like Roy Jones allegedly. And uh, uh, and so I was telling him this other guy I know, I'm like, Hey, yeah. So I got the stuff, it looked like Molly, but the guy said was ecstasy and uh, and it did this, this was my effects on it. He goes, oh yeah, that's bath salts. People are actually selling that as ecstasy a lot in la right now. It's like, I've seen US basketball. Hey, did that mess fast? So in the house you're retarded. Yeah, I was doing whatever people get it. And what's funny is that it felt, it felt like ecstasy. Like it started like, okay, here it goes. I'm feeling good, feeling good, and I guess I'm tired. Goodnight. It was, it almost got to the point, God like euphoric, euphoric body kind of feeling good. Kind of, kind of like the ecstasy feeling, but then it just fizzles off. Every ecstasy

Speaker 5:          01:54:24       have that, that that next day, Blah feeling.

Speaker 2:          01:54:28       Well I was using on it labs dotcoms roll on and roll off. So I had no feeling the next day I felt fine. This is real. This stuff really works. The on stuff

Speaker 5:          01:54:38       I gave that shit the, the, the nootropic formula. Eddie, do you know we're making a brain pill. Oh wait, I got to talk about this to make it a brain pill. We're making a neutral. No, no, no. Me and Chris Markus criminal. Chris mark is doing all the work. We're gonna, I'm gonna help promote it. But uh, he started a laboratory when he left. Fleshlight started a laboratory for a, he's been on the podcast a bunch of times and twice. And uh, he decided to come up with his own business and one of them was that there's a bunch of different nootropics, a bunch of different like supplements that can aid in brain function. And what he did is kind nightmares, combine all the best ones and put them together. Dude, they give you the craziest fucking, well that's when I had the Arnold Schwarzenegger. What else? What's on here?

Speaker 2:          01:55:17       My girlfriend, I had been letting her have some of it nightmares really cause he's just intense nightmares and I didn't have nightmares but I had intense dreams. You said after you said that I started actually realizing, oh it's because of that.

Speaker 5:          01:55:32       No they're not. They're not. Um, well maybe like that, but this is going to be much stronger. And this stuff is like super called brain factors and I like can't go below but everything, everything for the brain in one formula.

Speaker 6:          01:55:44       I don't know what his levels were and what stuff he had as opposed to what stuff Chris has had. I would like to look at the two of them, but whatever it is, this shit that Chris has put together, he's thoroughly researched this and come up with this incredible formula. It really fucking works. First of all, it really freaky thing is, man, you don't get tired on this shit. That's the weird thing. Like if I travel all the way across the country, you would figure by the time I get there, five hours later I'm exhausted. Right? But when I take these fucking pills, man, we did a show on Friday. We've, we threw it, flew a red eye. All right, landed Friday morning. I didn't sleep at all. I slept a little bit on the plane. I ate something, got in the shower, went to the UFC, Wayans went from the Wayans and got some food, ate food.

Speaker 6:          01:56:22       W W W worked over my material, went over some of my material, gotten with Joey, we smoked a joint, went onstage, then did our show afterwards wanting to hang out with Ralphie May. Afterwards we went to a strip club afterwards, came back to the hotel and I'm still awake. I'm like, how the fuck am I awake? And then I realized I took six of those fucking pills. I took three earlier. Three. Yeah. Cause I was exhausted. I took three in the morning and then three like an hour before the show. Wow. Woo Dog. Just figured some shit out man. That's the crazy thing is when you have dreams, the dreams are super vivid and you can remember them, man.

Speaker 2:          01:56:58       It's because your mind's eye that whatever receptors awake, it's something's awake. That's usually not a wait cause that's like when we were talking about nicotine where it keeps your nicotine receptors in your head awake when you're on United, do a patch while you're sleeping, whatever's in that shit. It has something that it's reacting to.

Speaker 6:          01:57:13       Well, what I was impressed with is that I had some good ideas and I didn't want to get up and write them down and I actually remembered them. Oh really? That's never happens. That never happened. It feels sharper. Definitely. I was going over that video. You know there's a video. Have you seen it online of a, the Miss USA pageant contestants. They asking them about evolution. Yeah. Have you seen it? Yeah, I saw it. Pull that shit up cause it's fucking fascinating. Pull it up and we'll just, we'll play a little bit of it. Cause it's, it's the most ridiculous shit ever. And they get these girls and all of them from the deep south, all of them don't believe in evolution. They're all like, well I don't believe in evolution. You know, and I'm thinking while I'm there, I'm of course you don't believe in evolution.

Speaker 6:          01:57:48       You 20 years old, nobody's ever caveman fucked you. Nobody ever gorilla. Fuck do you? You don't, you don't know what darkness really is. You don't know that there are shades to man. There's a, there's a whole progression. There's a fucking spectrum of human behavior from really civilized and beautiful and nice to barbaric and animalistic and that shits because we came from fucking animals hooker. You, you just haven't even, I haven't experienced that yet. And your, your little cute life with your sash on your fucking, I remembered it all vividly when I woke up in the morning. What is the, we don't really have to see it. Yeah, it's really a low fruit as low hanging fruit. It's, it's just really, really poor dumb girls that are 20 years old and they're asking him about evolution and they're saying things that they want people to hear. Well, I think Jesus put me here for a purpose because they think that all the people from their church and all the people back home, that's what they would want to hear. You know, when you're 20 years old, you're indoctrinated into the world of religion. What are the odds of, you actually have a real opinion of it. You actually sat down and

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       sorted the shit out. Most of the time they're just spitting out shit that other people had been saying to them their whole life. You know, 20 years old. The fuck did you know when you were 20 you know, could you imagine if somebody had you on video talking about what you thought about the world when you were 20 I was an atheist at 20 do you got to talk in the mic, Bro? I was an atheist at 20

Speaker 2:          01:59:00       yeah, I have a video made top 20 just smoking weed with a bunch of my friends. That's all I all I cared about smoking weed and music. Yeah. Well you probably just, you were stuck in Ohio too, man. You know what the fuck you were in Columbus. What am I doing? You're all over the place now that you're, your shit's blowing the fuck up. You're planning a 10th of planets. Are you ever at home? Are you going out to a different city every week? Are you doing classes at Buddy's buddy? What you're talking about when you, what do you were talking, you were saying 10 planets. Planets. Yeah, just, just schools. But you, you have them all over the place. How many do you have now? Around 30. Wow. And so you're traveling pretty much every weekend and do a seminar. And one of them, I'm trying to do two a month.

Speaker 2:          01:59:39       And for me they cation and staying in la, staying home and I like, I like being at my house. I love hanging out with my bunny and my girlfriend. Just relax and go check out a movie. Just doing nothing, doing nothing at home when you have a day when you don't have to fucking be anywhere. So beautiful. So I try to try to stay home two weekends out of the month, you know, that's why I quit the UFC as well. I was trying to make it to my schools and do the FC. I'd be gone every weekend. Just can't do it. Well that's good that the school, uh, your schools have become quite successful now and you, and it's so funny. I see your shirt, your logo at all these places. I would be just sitting there and I'm like, Oh my God, that guy has a 10th planet shirt on and it makes me almost want to be like, hey dude, what's up?

Speaker 2:          02:00:21       You're not like, I feel like, oh, they all know Eddie's take Jujitsu. I got an already to do it for a year. Well, one my knee to time. You need Zell fucked up. All right. It will pop out of place in Jujitsu. Oh, probably. I'm not going to risk that. That was the last time it popped out of place for popped out once and then once it was close popping out where it felt like it did. How long after you actually injury was that popped out? Uh, three years. Four years? Yeah. It was pretty far afterwards. Yeah, it was skiing too and it was like, oh my God. Did it just pop out to fucking hurt or, yeah, you've got to develop a higher tolerance to pain, son. I, you know, I just don't have time. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          02:00:55       Get from Jujitsu, man, you got a high tolerance to pain because you're always in pain. You always getting smashed. You always, when you're next getting choked yours, your face is getting smushed. You know, like when you get tattooed, like some people get tattooed and they fucking scream in agony. I fell asleep getting tattooed once, literally nodded out. Just you get used to putting it out. You used to putting pain and then the any martial art and you're hitting things and Moy Thai guys, man, they don't think they get accustomed to paying you. You leg kicks always hurt, man. They're going to hurt forever. But you just get accustomed to that. You just deal with it. You know your legs certainly toughen up. Especially your, you know, your thighs toughen up and your shins really toughen up. They actually develop like little micro fractures over the surface of your Shin from clashing and other shins and kicking fucking banana trees and shit like that.

Speaker 5:          02:01:38       Like those, those crazy tag ions that are constantly kicking like banana trees, they develop like shins that like weapons man. You know, they've, they've, there's like a sports science on it where they showed um, uh, Melcher um, God, I forget the last, his name, his name, his phone, but it is a phase a Moy Thai guy. But uh, he's a former world champion and they had him kicked baseball bats and he was breaking baseball bats with his shins. Dude. Dude, it was so crazy to watch it just swing in that leg, kick into a baseball bat and snap in the handle off. Fuck that dude. He did two different kinds of, did an ash one and ash bat and a maple bat because the ash bad apparently is a little easier. So then he moved to the maple one next. Oh yeah. That is grabbing my shins.

Speaker 5:          02:02:26       There's such a difference in striking the difference in your striking in Jujitsu. I mean, you can get hurt and both of them, for sure. Miguel Torres, former WCPC bantamweight champion posted a picture, worst Bjj injury ever at my gym and it's a dude's toe. His toe got broken. Have you seen it? You have to see it. You need to look at it. Do Toe got broken and snapped off and the bone was sticking straight out. Dude, it was ha ha, hard core. And I was like, yeah, that can happen, man. Dudes can get fucked up. But it's striking you much more likely to get Roy Jones and striking. That shit is a, that's shit's happening on a regular dudes are constantly getting brained. You know, there's constantly getting knocked out. There was a post on the underground the other day, some guy was talking about getting knocked out and training, you know, and how much it pissed you off.

Speaker 5:          02:03:11       Some, some new guy came in and didn't really know what he's doing, swaying full blast and he didn't get out of the way and he got knocked unconscious, you know? And it's fucking not good man. When you watch something like Pat Barry and check Congo does that shit, uh, does that Shit Register with you? Do you see that and go, whoa, like what's what's going on inside Pat Barry's had right now and check congos both of them got rained on, you know? Yeah. I mean, it was for a fan. It was amazing, but I would never want to do that show. I love watching it though, but I'm not down for getting hit. It'd be awesome if they could fix it. You know? It's like, you know, if, uh, if you tear a knee ligament, they can fucking get another ligament, stick it in there and screw it in place and they can fix you up.

Speaker 5:          02:03:55       Nice. You know, if you like hurt your brain, they go do it. Don't worry about it. We're going to put you in his chamber. It rejuvenating all your brain cells and it's, you know, you're going to be 100% a couple of weeks. What if it was Chris Markus stuff actually does that? I don't think so. What's it's going to be a lot more complicated than some herbs, I think. I would think that if there's gonna be something that regenerates brain tissue that's injured, it's going to be something like some nanotechnology, something that re rehabilitates or fixes tissue sponsor Roy Jones and see what happens. Oh, we can Shakespearian off the top of his head. The crazy thing is he's not even willing to retire. He owes taxes. Apparently he was a three point $5 million in taxes

Speaker 6:          02:04:38       according to my online sources that I quickly googled. How does someone with millions and don't pay? Man, they don't fucking pay. They just don't have enough business manager and accountant. They just get stupid man. They get stupid, they get stupid. They just, they just spend all that money and they, you know, they have some wacky motherfucker that's handling their money. Just like a kind of guy who would have a wacky motherfucker handling his hormones. There's a guy that would have a wacky motherfucker handling his money and that guy tells you like Wesley Snipes is dude told him, you know, hey, you don't have to pay taxes man. That shit is unconstitutional. Look, I'll show you the closet is man, they ain't even going to come after you because they don't want anybody to know about this. And they're like, oh yeah, no, they're going to come after you and you're going to have to go to jail for a few years.

Speaker 6:          02:05:17       You know, you're a movie star and all of a sudden you're in jail. You're in. He's still in jail. He's in jail right now. He's in jail right now. He's going to be in jail for three years. They want to let people know, hey, we will lock you in a fucking cage. Stupid. You need to pay us and you need to let everybody know that you're paying and let everybody know that they need to pay. We all need money to make this fucking thing work. No cops don't work for free, you know it's not free to fix the highways. We need fucking money. Even if you don't agree with it, even if it's too much and I agree it is. It's definitely too much. You've got to pay that shit anyways. Side to put you in a fucking cage. Right? Brian,

Speaker 2:          02:05:51       did you have some tax problems? I still do. What's your tax problems now? The states coming after me. What did you do a use TurboTax and blindly was like, oh I have receipts for all this shit. Thinking that I would just use my credit card statements and then I didn't know like credit card statements only go back now like a year. Like if you want to go back in time and look at a statement or something like that, they don't let you go any farther than a year. You can't even find them now. No. No. Whoa. I didn't know that so cause I was doing my taxes thinking like, oh yeah, you know I got proof of purchase that you know all my students that like the bank getting together with the fucking absolutely tax people. Do you think that they conspired to like let's just find a lot of people out of money, man, we can get a lot more money that way.

Speaker 2:          02:06:34       Yeah. All these assholes claiming the deductibles and shit. Yeah, it's stressful stuff, man. I've had a business lounge are now three years and it relieves so much stress. I don't think about shit. If the government came after me, I got all that shit under control now. I just don't do it. Even though I should be writing all this shit off that I do and stuff like that. Now I'm just like, you know what? Fuck it. I'll just do like I do. And why don't you go to like H and r block? Because it's like $1,000 or something like that. I don't want to do it. I should. Is it 1000 bucks? It's a couple hundred bucks, man and r block. I was doing that before I got my business manager. My girl right now just paid something like $700 at h and r block to do her taxes. Really. Maybe just robbed her members. Like, Ooh, this bitch, I'm gonna get her to give me a lot of money. Yeah. I mean, to me, I'd rather, you know, I hate taxes so much, so I'd rather just go to TurboTax, take 10 minutes and do it and get it sent away, you know? And then having to pay extra and try to find money and do all that crap, which I should do. Yeah, I got to go. It's also got their fucking complicated. It's too stressful to think about. That shit is so fucking complicated,

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       isn't it? You're one of my movie drops. I'll go get me an accountant. When you move the drums, what are you gonna do in the movie porn? Hmm. First person does not worth any money in porn anymore. Dude, you gotta come up with another strategy and that strategy would have been the shit and 1993 you could have been like Peter North. Peter North drives a Ferrari and he did gay porn. Yeah. How about that? How about that? He's the only one that got away with doing gay porn. He did gay porn and they're like, all right, don't do it again. And then he came back and did regular porn from then on out. He did a little gay porn. I didn't believe it. Like people told me, it was like, no way. Not Peter man, no way, dude. You know, cause if you're going to have a porn idle, that's the one that have, you know, dude shoots these giant monster loads.

Speaker 6:          02:08:15       But then he'd go and find some videos online. It was a dude sucking his cock and like, hey, hey, hey. And this dude's bone in them in the ass. Be like, hey, hey, hey. And he tried to say there was like a body double sun to ain't no CGI that good. Talk about the hungry as butter ward. Can we talk about that already? Yeah, we did. I think we talked about it on stage and time that you came on earth. Oh, we didn't really, we talked about it on the podcast. Yeah. Second time. That is a crazy story. Good story. Is it good for the quick version of it? Is that a friend of ours? We won't say it. I wouldn't do that. I think we do. A friend of ours, no we didn't. We never did. How dare you? Friend of ours, uh, was uh, running a small mixed martial arts corporation and he found, um, they did a, an internet search on one of their fighters and they found out that he had won the Hungary is but award and then they uh, googled and there was no Google back then.

Speaker 6:          02:09:09       This is like the nineties. And they found some online pictures of him with two dudes treating him like Chinese finger. How many dicks in your ass do you have to get to get that and that in a year to get that award? Like I think it's wrong weekend. I'm thinking it's just what they called a video to sell it. How much? I don't think there was really like an award show. No, I think he won like eight. It was AVN, Hungary, his butt or something. Like it was the name of a video. The hungry is butter wards or something like that. It wasn't an actual award that he won? No. I mean it might look, look, we could give out an award for the hungriest butter. No. Worst side. Brian wins it. You know they are. You're in the business. Hey, do you know who the Helio Gracie of gay porn is?

Speaker 6:          02:09:54       Like who is the master of get like who just crushes everybody? Who's the Kelly Slater of her guy? Gay Porn for gay porn? I don't know anything about it. That must be, it must be a Jenna Jamison of gay porn, right? Master one more gay male, male gay porn star. We shouldn't even be googling this. There's probably puts you on the list. Yeah. Male porn. Is there a guide that just stands head and shoulders above everyone else? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe a Twitter would know. I bet if we asked Twitter, dear Twitter, what is the number one gay male porn star in the world? Is there a Michael Jordan? I read off the first answer. Not. You don't think so? No. I think there's so many. I Dunno. I just don't think porn. Some Lance Armstrong type motherfucker that figures things out that other people can't just rises to the top and becomes famous at a genre where no one else is getting famous gay gang.

Speaker 6:          02:10:48       A gang bangs. Like is there a dude who went to 50 oh, the DP or triple p and the butthole. Do they do that? Can you were asking me? Okay. This guy says, I only watch Steph Brent again, or this is a woman rather ampers and she says it's Brent Corrigan. That might be her ex boyfriend. Let's see. Oh yeah. My passion. I like this fucking clown. I'm going to, I'm going to get him on the, on the Joe Rogan podcast. Okay. Let's see. He's a male modern gay pornograph as best known for his stage name. Hmm. Yup. There he is. A little fellow's already highlighted. [inaudible] known for his roles in schoolboy crush. Uh, and Velvet Mafia. He has won six Gay v n they have the, gave Ian's et cetera. Higgins Avn awards including best bottom award two consecutive years. The butthole, or are they just talking about the shape of the butt?

Speaker 6:          02:11:50       Um, best bottom is you being on the bottom, taken in the ass. Yeah. It doesn't mean they wouldn't say bottom instead of bought hall. You know, Jesus Christ, they're, they're pretty open about how they feel. And I say I love his bottom. No, they'd say is asshole. What's the record for Gay Gang Bangs? So is it, what the fuck? Right. This guy's been a lot of God damn movies. All right, let's, let's find out what the number, uh, w what would we, what would we say? Gay, Gay, gay record. See, Greece holds the record for the biggest gay gang. Bang. Grease the movie. No, probably probably a dude. This was 780 men. Regular checks going nuts on ass suck. Wow. 780 men but not one dude, right? Yeah. There's one dude, I believe they've got a crush women because the women are doing like 50, maybe a hundred is the rec side, but guys don't stop the craziness that are causing more durable that buttholes I think that the problem is finding these guys that get in line and film it.

Speaker 6:          02:13:03       Gay guys finding that would be hard cause it's 10% of the population. It'd be hard. But if the numbers weren't a problem, they're willing to ship people in. I think guy gay porn would crush regular pointing. Gangbang wow. Listen to this though, man. Listen to this shit. The most, uh, Jackie Latori orgasms ever recorded in one hour for a man is 1616 in one hour, orgasms recording in one hour for a man to die, for the furthest a woman has ever been recorded to ejaculate was nine feet 29 inches. Well, why would it be nine feet 29 and she scored 12 inches is a foot. That's stupid. That doesn't make any sense. I came 16 times in an hour. Why was it same? Nine feet, 29 inches. Oh, it says three meters. Okay. Is that three minutes is just nine feet, right, isn't it? No, no. It's three feet per meter, right? Roughly. Right. So three meters is nine feet. So why is it nine feet 29 inches? That doesn't make any sense of 12 inches is afoot anyway. Whatever the fuck this says, the greatest distance ever attained for a jet of semen that has ever been recorded is 18 feet. Nine inches. That's huge. Wow.

Speaker 6:          02:14:13       Why would it be Lexington Steel? Horst? Schulze, that's the guy's name that shot a load that went 18 feet in the, in the, in the air. That's a credible up, up in the air or across, uh, what are the ways by distance? It's gotta be a distance. No Way. It could be straight up at 18 feet. That's incorrect. You as must have an arc to it. A Nice Arc, like a McDonald's sign type thing. Going on for 18 feet. Did they video it? I don't know. They must say this. I mean these are all world records. This is the top 10 sex world records. It's on, believe it or not, the average speed of a man's loads. What would you say your average speed, your loads would be like 35 miles an hour. What do you think Brian? 80 to 28 miles an hour. 28 miles an hour, so it's pretty close.

Speaker 6:          02:14:56       It's pretty close. If the car drove by, you could tell the difference between cargo in 28 miles an hour and 35 miles an hour. That's pretty fucking close. Having swallowed the most amount of semen ever officially recorded. Michelle Monaghan had 1.7 pints of semen pumped out of her stomach in Los Angeles in July of 1991 it was that pumped out by her ass. That'd be awesome, dude. 1.7 pints, but maybe if she had like a glass of coconut water. C Two o very delicious right before and it mixed in with the loads. Maybe my increased the size of the quantity of fluid in her when she threw up. Maybe she was throwing up loads and a sprite. You don't know. Right, right. What are they going to test it and make sure it's a hundred percent loads? No, they're just looked at it and a slice of pizza.

Speaker 6:          02:15:42       He wouldn't know the difference. Yeah. She just came into a big one of those big glass baking measurement cups. She just threw up in it. There was 1.7 the fuck is this podcast com female gang bang record is owned by a woman named Houston who had intercourse. It's 620 men. I think that's been been by then. This is some old guys. Yeah, that's the old one. A lot. I don't think it really is 600 men though. I think what they do is they do is the same guys and they keep rotating them. Consider the idea that guy, they like the common and they come back. That's not the real records like who made those records at Saint People? Me, girl fucks two dudes and they switch off a couple of times. She can say she fucked 15 guys. This doesn't even have gay. It has a male gang bang male gangbang world record goes to porn star. John Doe who worked himself over 55 women and one day he had five to six ejaculations. Hmm. Pretty good. Well, yeah, the checks. Meanwhile that got committed suicide. I got blew his fucking brains out.

That's hard to believe. I don't know anybody like that.

Speaker 6:          02:17:27       That's right. Again, it's possible. It's all possible, dude. If you were like some Super Alpha Quinten Jackson looking mother Fucker, I might buy it. I might believe it. But maybe all your testosterone, it's just stored up in your balls and your buddy doesn't use any of it for muscle development or you know, behavior or any of that shit. It's all just in your balls. Ready to shoot.

Speaker 1:          02:17:46       I say two minutes to take like a minute after I come. If I look at this, boners comes right back to your fucking pictures of your girlfriend away. You're really making me sad. Seriously. I never goes away. I just have like my, for the, for the first time in my life, my boner never goes down. I just can, you know why you're saying this?

Like I've always wondered how like guys in porn do it and stuff like that. Viagara when you drink. Some might be because I've already said that. I think she's like

Speaker 6:          02:18:43       get it in there and maybe she got tired of you. Like remember you, you say you would fall asleep because you were too tired to go down on her and then fall asleep because you were too tired to do anything. You do her and then you would fall asleep.

Speaker 1:          02:18:53       You talked about on the podcast, so yes you did. My current girlfriend, she said she was horny and you were too tired to have sex with her. She would go down now. That was one time. That was one time.

Speaker 6:          02:19:04       One time. One time. Maybe that time she's like, I'm tired of this shit. I want to get fucked and so she started crumpling up by Agra and I'm going to cook for you tonight, honey. She made you a nice Viagara meatloaf in like 2001 I got third row tickets to the cure.

So he would call her born again that that was her nickname.

Speaker 3:          02:19:27       Born again. That's hilarious. So anyways, uh, she was only stripping just to pay for school, but she was like hardcore Christian cause you're thinking of this. But we were going to the cure. So I'm like, I need some ecstasy for this concert. So I meet up with my buddy in the afternoon to get some Mexican and I always have bought vitamin bottles with me and I put them into my vitamin bottles and I go, when I eat, I'm going to take them out of the vitamin bottle and you know, eat and take my vitamins. It's one o'clock. I go to El Pollo Loco, we're sitting, we're going to leave around seven. I eat my chicken sitting there watching TV and I just got really horny.

I jumped off the bed with open up my vitamin bottle. Second Fuck, are you fucking [inaudible] I forgot to blow them out of my vitamins. I didn't know I was on ecstasy until right in the middle of sex. That's, it was incredible sex. I'm like, it's like I'm on email and it's just, that's funny. I flew eyes.

Speaker 6:          02:20:41       He supposed to kill your boner. Didn't you say that you would take Viagra and eat together

Speaker 3:          02:20:46       called after a while. After a while it kills your bone, but not in the beginning and the beginning. You get really, really horny. But if you want to go because when you're on, yeah, well people are different. No, no. People are different. Like for me, if, if you know, back in the days when every now and then I pop a pill, I would get a boner really quick. How many times would have done he in your life? How many times, man, back when I was younger I probably did eat maybe

Speaker 6:          02:21:16       40 times. Whoa. Oh Mike. Is that a lot? That expensive? Lots of it. It explains a lot. What do you mean is it was, and I was like, when I was younger, this motherfucker's taking shit. He doesn't even know what it is. He's taking bath salts. You gotta get your shit from reputable sources. You need to find some friendly person that works at a club somewhere, but excess is bad. Okay. I don't, it kills your brain and for sure does or ecstasy is not bad like MDM. And the problem is, is that you don't know what you're taking. Yeah. Bass Hall boy shit. Exactly. That stuff's supposed to be really tough. If you've seen it, this, this crocodile shit, they shit that they're taking the Soviet Union to shooting it up and it's making your skin runaway. There's all these photos of people with their bones hanging off.

Speaker 6:          02:22:01       Literally your bones exposed when were were wherever they shot it up. Like their flesh has deteriorated to a point where their bones are exposed. Yeah. It's crazy to look at it, man. That's gross. What a weird world we live in, man. People will take some drug that will make your, your skin literally rot off your body. People take some shit that they think is ecstasy and it turns out to be some weird fucking amphetamine that somebody made in the lab. You know, who knows what the fuck is going to do to you and it's not the end. They're gonna keep coming up with more and more of these things. Thinking about stuff off the dummies. Yeah. These bath salts. That's you bro. You took that shit. Does it, does that scare you when you think of that? Ah, that you could have taken something really nutty? Yeah. When you buy stuff like that, if you biolink ACCC, doesn't that scare you? Like you never know. Like you might get it from some, some dude that is scaring you. Heard about this cocaine that's making people's fucking flesh rot. If you heard about this shit, this is some cocaine is bad cocaine. That's in California. It's in New York and it's treated with some livestock dewormer. That's what they cut it with. And you know, let me look it up right now because it's fucking crazy. And people you probably hear, yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:23:07       okay.

Speaker 6:          02:23:07       Yeah, yeah. It's um, cocaine, bad cocaine in Los Angeles, in New York City tainted with a, some sort of a, I'm hearing this a livestock dewormer yeah, it's really fucked up. What happens when you do it? They, they're getting, they're getting really bad. Um, uh, noses, ears and cheeks develop ugly purple swatches of dead skin.

Speaker 6:          02:23:28       This is like d, it's, it's called Lavana soul. That's the stuff. And the dealers are cutting it with this shit. And they say like 90% of the cocaine in New York and California is, is contaminated with, is this, this shit? 90% of the cocaine and cow, excuse me, 70% of the u s department of Justice is reporting this. Okay. By the way, this is just the u s department of Justice. They might just be saying this to cut out the cocaine business. They're saying up to 70% of the cocaine in the u s is contaminated with this love van, Mother's soul, which is cheap and widely available and commonly used for deworming livestock.

Speaker 1:          02:24:04       Whoa. What the fuck man? What are they doing?

Speaker 6:          02:24:10       You would think that debt would be something that someone who hates cocaine users would do. You would think that that would be someone who actually wants to stop people from using cocaine. Would you know? They would like mix it in there so that people would stop coming back. You know what I'm saying? Like why would you do that if you're trying to sell more cocaine then almost seems like something like the government would do ma'am. Like the whole story's probably fake and they're just putting it out there to scare you. Like people are on Pirate Bay, like, oh there's a buyers in this file. I Dunno, maybe, but it's on La la weekly. It seems like they would do their due diligence, don't you think? Yeah, I like Waco. Don't you think? Yeah, you fell asleep on me. You mother fucker. No, I'm just thinking about your girlfriend said, Elliot, what do you think getting, do you think that they would do this? Who the fuck would do this? Do you think this is the government?

Speaker 1:          02:24:55       Who knows?

Speaker 6:          02:24:56       Do you see the UFO videos over London? Do you believe in those? Did you see that? I saw w what does that look like to, I just, there's so many videos like that dude looks like Cgi to me. It's too convenient, the whole, the way it's set up as two convenient. There's a bunch of people standing there looking up and everybody's looking up at night. They're catching these things and they fly in and out of the clouds. I've seen it, but you know what really makes me think that it's, it's a two convenient. The guy film looks up, films, some of the Ufos and then looks down all these people watching, which is the fucking last thing that you would do if you actually thought you saw a real Ufo is flying through the air. You would keep the fucking camera on them. You wouldn't want to turn it point down it all these people watching.

Speaker 6:          02:25:35       Maybe. Maybe you don't know what the hell it is and like look, everyone's tripping out. You know he showed that before you showed everybody looking up at the sky and then he catches this actors. Yeah, I think it's fake. People get a kick out of doing shit like that. They think it's cute. So much fake shit on the Internet now. That's one of the fun things about the Internet. Trying to figure out what's fake and what's not. Brian's the master at that Shit. He calls fakes. He calls fix better than anybody but sometimes he's off. Sometimes it's just sound sync problems and it looks fake. Look at this cocaine shit like we was doing these people. It's making their skin right off. Its like making that year turn like blue on black hair skin. Your skin's fucking farm cocaine. Yup. Oh my God. Yeah. There's some people have suffered permanent scarring on their body from this shit. You know what got the good shit. No fall off. This message brought to you by prescription pills. What is that shit? What's it called? It's called love van muscle. Yeah. L. E. V. A. M. I. S. O. L. E. Van Assault. It's bad for your kids. And on that note, I think this fucking podcast started off real strong and then someone other than we, we lost the last team

Speaker 1:          02:26:44       we got into gay porn. It was my fault. We got into gay porn and Brian started reminiscing about his girlfriend

Speaker 6:          02:26:51       looking at pictures. Oh. Um, tomorrow, somebody, I'm not sure, somebody will be on the podcast. The guy from, um, ancient aliens is coming on the podcast and he's coming on at the end of July. It will be July 27. And um, his name is Giorgio and it's just a tough one to pronounce. T. S. O. U. K. A. L. O. S. I think the is silent. Yeah. Soup. Gallows, sucralose, sucralose, Giorgio sucralose. And he's the guy from ancient aliens with the crazy hair who's a, a self professed wacky, alien, loving bastard. Cause that's what I called them and said yes. Guilty as charged. He's cool as fuck. I like him and I'm, I'm excited to have mom because we're going to talk about some weird shit. You should probably be on that one, man. I would love to ask a question. You should probably be in on that one. That would be a fun conversation. Yeah. We might have to bring you in on that one. I have to bring Eddie, Eddie Bravo and with the the alien dude. Be honored. Yeah, because no one loves the aliens more than you and him. You and him together. It would be a fucking, we fucked people. I tsunami of aliens.

Speaker 1:          02:27:57       Don't you have like aliens all over your logos and your shirt? Just don't necessarily believe in them. I do my logos. Well, my whole logo is an alien. If I'm down. I love a love Ufo DVDs and I do short 200 of them, but that's why I don't believe in them. I seen so much stuff. I think the way I look at it, and this is not, not that I don't in them because it's not

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       that I don't believe in them. I don't not believe, I don't believe you are. Foes don't exist. I don't believe that my, in my mind is open about it, but I'm not convinced either way. But the way I look at it, it's like everyone's got a goddamn camera with a f on their phone. Everyone does. Now you would think that if there, if I meet a thousand people, okay, out of every thousand people that I meet, at least 10 of them are fucking morons. Like extreme morons, right? If you meet a thousand when you say 10 or just complete idiots, pathological liars completely fucked up, right? It a good solid 10 right? So I would think that if there's that many people that are idiots and fucked up, and then you look at the number of Ufo stories, like what are the numbers? The numbers like are similar to what you would expect from a population of retards. I got a small population and dominant. You look at the smartest people on the opposite end of the spectrum. Wernher von Braun and Hermann Oberth. There were rocket scientists. They not only believe in aliens, they're saying our technology came from messages from pea beans, from other solar system. That's what they're saying. Yeah. I would have to talk to them. I believe that. I believe that quote go, go Wernher von Braun. Well,

Speaker 9:          02:29:31       uh,

Speaker 6:          02:29:34       uh, beans from Ufo beans from other worlds. His exact quote is beans from other worlds helped us. I've seen that. I've seen that written, but who knows what that really is what he said. You know, it's so hard when the dude's dead and he died in 1977. You know, who the fuck knows what he actually said? You know? Well, you know that he's quoted as saying it, so maybe that's, yeah, maybe, but yeah, two different guys. No, I think, look, it is entirely possible if it's proven that the quote was actually legit, like yes, here's the video of him actually saying then what, what happens at that point? That's, that's pretty convincing evidence. Maybe. Or He may be, he's a troll. Maybe Wernher von Braun was a big Nazi troll. I mean, the thing about Wernher von Braun is he was the head of Nazi of NASA rather. But he was a confirmed Nazi and the Simon Wiesenthal Center said, if that guy was alive today, they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity.

Speaker 6:          02:30:29       So who the fuck knows? He could have been trolling, but I don't, I don't believe that it's impossible. It's definitely possible. So I'm looking forward to having this Giorgio dude on. It should be a fascinating conversation. I want to find out how his brain works, man. You know, because he said, he says a lot of crazy stuff. I want to know. Yeah. He seems like I almost like it could be a character, may be a little bit, maybe. Maybe it's fun, you know, maybe some of it's sexy. I mean, he runs x. He, yeah, it's sexy. It's sexy to believe in bigfoot. Right. You know, it's sexy to believe in aliens. It's sexy to believe in all that shit. It's interesting. Who the fuck knows? But that's coming up. I don't know who's going to be on tomorrow, but we'll get somebody. Uh, and then, um, maybe Thursday's going to be my friend, young urban, you know, young dude who wrote all the books on, um, on mushrooms and, and religion.

Speaker 6:          02:31:12       The problem is he's got the flu and I don't want the fucking flu. Yeah. Let's give him a couple of weeks. Yeah. I might, I might have the guy that he's the guy that turned you to Terence Mckenna. Yeah, he turned me on to a lot of things. Uh, he's uh, he's a fascinating cat. He's a real, real odd duck. And uh, he's written two books now on psychedelics and religion one, and he was with us when we first did. Damn t he was with us when we, you had that crazy bad trip. The first one was horrible. Yeah. It was pretty bad. Screaming and gallon screaming. Well Eddie fucked up and he ate food right before he went on his trip, which you're never supposed to do. You're not supposed to have anything in your stomach when you go on the trip because your body, you know, kind of freaks out.

Speaker 6:          02:31:48       So he in the middle of this trip gets up and I have to help him get to sink and he threw up in the sink. You, you hurled in this sense, just throw up all over the floor. No, no, no, no. You made it to the sink. You manage the sink. You don't even remember the story that could, right. It's probably [inaudible]. I just don't remember exactly. It was ed per Gail the whole time too. I was like, wow, just hanging out with ed brick gal, because when whoever wrote this whole story on your message board didn't put Eddie Bravo. That was John. John Changed the names of everything and I thought it was ed per gallon. It was a Johnny rotten, I think it was Johnny rotten. Maybe I was either Yana Johnny rotten changed the names of everything sink and your little bar, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:32:24       That's what he threw up. Yeah. You heard, I looked up at you and I remember because I was screaming, I was screaming and I looked up at you and I'm like, all right, don't worry about me. And then like that was like me letting you know, just let me fucking throw up, scream, I'm going to be fine. Well, the thing about bad trips is the real, real bad trips happen when you're trying to control the experience. Like the whole idea is to just let go and let this journey happened and you got to, you got to trust in the psychedelic, but you are fighting it tooth and claw and it was all going on. That first time was a disaster. Shazamm this Friday night, July 1st we will all be in Las Vegas, Brian included. So if you want a hug, Brian, come on down. We met this dude who had a fucking death squad tattoo your little logo.
