Speaker 1:          00:00:10       And we're live. So literally this morning I had this thought, um, I thought about it a bit yesterday and this morning I thought of it and I was like, why don't you just do it? I said, I need to do like some sort of a, an MMA recap show cause there's always so much shit that's happening then I miss a lot of it. I don't get a chance to talk to a lot of it. I love doing it with Brendan. He's my favorite because we get so silly and because he loves MMA as much as I do know, I could talk to him forever about it. So I'm sure I'll do some of those. Definitely in the future with him. Uh, he's really good at breaking down fights to men. He has a, he's got a skeptical eye for things and he has a great, obviously it was a high level professional heavyweight fighter, but he also has a real good understanding of where someone is at various stages of their career.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       I think that's big because fighters have like these peaks and valleys and you never know where they're at. You know, like fighting is a hard, hard business and the idea that you could stay at like a super high level for a long period of time, that just doesn't seem to be the case. It seems like everybody's body starts giving out after a certain period of time, after a certain amount of time cage fighting your body, just giving out unless you're a guy like GSP that takes all this time off, which I think was brilliant. Now in retrospect, he knew what we all didn't know. He really was in fucking amazing shape. He really was fighting, I don't say amazing cardio shape cause that's one legit criticism that Brendan had is that he looked like he was getting tired and it was pretty early in the fight.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       The guy was off for four years and he's stepping right in fighting Bisbing who's the middleweight champion? That is not easy. It's very hard. Bisbing keeps a fast pace. He's got amazing cardio. He's tough as shit. Like there was a tall order like to see him come back like that. But he, I think he recognized that grind was too heavy on him, but he wasn't done yet. You know, he was only 32 I think when he retired. 32 is that right? Somewhere in that range comes back at 36. I'm like, wow, you know, what are the odds? He's actually going to be better than he was before or look good. He looked fucking amazing. He looked like a bigger, better version of the, the welterweight champion. George St Pierre was weird. It was weird to see. I mean, I don't want to say that I doubted them because I did not doubt him because I'm very open minded and I have a deep respect for George. I think he's amazing. He's just a great person. A great example of an, in my opinion like how a champion should carry himself. Like George has always been like one of my favorite examples because you see them and you liked that guy is like well spoken, he's friendly, he's genuine. And he's super open minded in terms of like,

Speaker 2:          00:02:57       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:02:58       uh, his to listen

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       to coaches and formulate a good game plan and always be trying out new stuff. Like he spent a lot of time working with those guys and a Hendo Gracie's that Donna hurt death squad. There was a lot of images of them training together if he's training with like Gary Tonin and some of these fucking animals.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       I mean, John Danaher is a wizard and he's, he's done just this amazing job with Eddie Cummins and these kids that he has in New York that has these, these leg lock masters. I mean, it says Gordon Ryan, they're just animals. He's guys are killing people. And for George to be in the mix with those guys, like he's, he's getting down with some serious fucking strangle experts.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       So for just knowing that he's training with those guys because Eddie Cummins has been killing tournament's. Gary. Tony has been killing her. They've all, Ryan's been killing tournament's that all those kids, Nikki Ryan, his brother too, they're all animals. So these got, like, Donna has this great group of really savage Jujitsu players and George has diving into that mix. Comes to la, he's doing boxing with Freddie Roach. You know, it was one of the best boxing coaches in the world. Many packy I was trainer. So he's like getting down with like real boxing trainers. He's getting down with real jujitsu coaches and he never stopped. He never stopped, which is just amazing. It's amazing that you can just jump right back in. Dominick Cruz send me a text message right after it was over. He said, I told you ring rust is bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:04:34       And unfortunately Dominic just broke his arm. I don't know the specifics of it, but that's a, that's a huge bummer. He's uh, he's gotta be chomping at the bit now to get back in there. Now that Tj just knocked out Cody Garbrandt he must be chomping, chomping at the bit. Um, so a few of the fights that went down really recently this past weekend, Pedis and pour. Yay. Holy Shit. What a good fight that was. That was crazy. That's a crazy fight. And Dustin poray at a 155 pounds, it seems like a different person. He just so much healthier at one 55 and he looked awesome. The Joe Duffy fight too. And this, this fight was a big, big wind farm though. Former champion in pedes guy who was a champion of strike force too. I mean, shit, that's, it's a big win. You know, Anthony Pettis is a tough loss. It seemed like he had broken a rib or something. Like there was something going on. Like when he got mounted, he had a tap, you know, that's uh, that's very unfortunate. But pet is just look really good. In his last fight, who did Pettis fight? He fought and beat in his last fight.

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       Did he fight Gilbert Melendez? Jim Miller. That's right. That's right. Who did Gilbert Melendez. Right. You know what I just watched the other day I rewatched Gilbert. Oh, Gilbert fought. Who has it? The kicked his legs. God dammit. Can't believe I'm forgetting this.

Speaker 1:          00:06:12       Jeremy Stevens. That's what, sorry, Jeremy. Jesus Christ. There was like one of Jeremy's team is, is fine, finest performances. I forgot who did it does too many fights. I have to erase my brain data. I got to race him. Dan Severn footage from the 90s. I just, I have to, I can't though out of respect, but I have just a too many fights floating around my fucking head. That fight was a good fight though, cause that was the pedes employee. A fight is a fight between two guys that are like legit top 10 contenders. Like either one of them with a couple of good wins could be fighting for the title and maybe for portrayed that was enough to get him in there and fight for the title. But it's like you gotta just a shark pool there. Tony Ferguson is the interim champ. Who knows what the fuck is going to happen now with Connor because Connor was involved in some sort of an altercation with referee Mark Goddard, where he jumped into the cage while the fight had not been called yet.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       Apparently this is mark Goddard's interpretation of it. And I think Connors Connors, uh, he made an apology and I think what he was basically saying was that he was angry that the referee had not stopped the fight. First he thought the referee had stopped the fight and then he was angry that he had not because he gets like really concerned when someone's taken a beating too much and he felt like this guy really was out of it and taking a beating. I think where the confusion was, and I hope I'm not fucking this up, we'll check the confusion was I think that Mark Goddard was saying essentially that he had not known whether or not the bell had gone off. He knows he knew the bell was close, but he did not know whether it had gone off. It was too loud in there for him to hear it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       And he was concerned. I believe that it went off. And so that's when he stepped in because he thought the round was over. He was not necessarily calling the fight yet. Then when Conor McGregor jumped in, since he hadn't already called the fight, he was in a bad situation cause the fight, technically speaking was still going on. I hope I'm not fucking this up. Did I fuck that up? He made a statement on Facebook. Yes. And by the way, I felt the way he wrote this statement was really, it was, it was not just like very professional. It was, it was very, I'm poised. I was very impressed with it. I don't want to read the whole thing, but he essentially says the first round is progressing and then so when the guy, when the guy got hurt, he said he connected a Charlie ward connected with the left hand that slumped John Redmond to his knees.

Speaker 1:          00:08:42       And at this exact point I could not, and had not made my determination that John was either out of the contest or not in the petition position to intelligently defend himself. The Punch and the action that followed resulted in a surge of crowd noise. One that was so significant. I had already made my determination that I could not audibly hear the bell sound for the end of the round. I had made my decision to step in with the belief that the bell had indeed been sounded, which in actual fact it had not, this is a critical fact to the ensuing proceedings. So apparently there was a massive amount of confusion because of the noise.

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       And so it looked like it looked like a very reasonable stop exceeding and find the video footage to me. Cause there's a bunch of video of the brawl itself and all the craziness that that happened with it. But it definitely seemed like if they, if I remember correctly, I've seen it, but I, last time I saw it was a couple of days ago, it looked like a really reasonable stoppage, like a smart stoppage, I guess see it and you go, yeah, that guy is, he's getting hurt, they should stop this. And then I think Connor just assumed when he stepped in, which you would, especially with staff fucking loud, you assume there's no bell and Mark Audit steps in.

Speaker 1:          00:10:08       See Conard runs in and he tackles him to the ground. And then, but there's already cornermen in there. And so these guys are hugging and Mark Goddard is trying to get control of the octagon. And so Connor comes at him, it pushes him and he's yelling at them this, this is a just a terrible scene. Terrible scene. You know, and I'm sure Connor, if you could take it back, we'd take it back because I'm sure he, you know, realize that this is a disaster. And he even apologized. You know, you can't, you can't do that. You can't run in. You gotta be sure that the referee stopped the fight.

Speaker 1:          00:10:52       And you know, I mean, they have to have control of the octagon, otherwise anything can happen, right? Anybody can get it in at any time. Not just a friend, but somebody wants to hurt you. So they don't know what I mean. Obviously they knew that Conner was probably coming in to congratulate his friend, but they, you can't make them give up the rules. Like the rules are in place for very good reasons to protect the athletes. People get super emotional about fights and there's many times I would believe that if they weren't like very, very stringent in how they allow the athletes to behave, like have really stringent set of rules. If they didn't do that, those guys would fight a lot. I mean there'll be a lot of chaos. People would climb into the ring and beat the shit out of each other. We've obviously had a few incidents where corners argued with each other, but relatively speaking, when you think about how many fights take place, it's a very small number and it's one of the reasons why is because we have pretty clear rules like you have to listen to the referee at all times.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       It's, it's real simple like this. There's a time where the cage is shot in the referees in there and that guy has control of that until you bring somebody in and he has to have control over it. If he calls the fight, then he does. He calls time and then he brings the doctors in or whatever he wants to do or he stops the fight. That is entirely this guy entirely be his call. And I see the Connor thought it was over and it was probably like completely caught in the moment and he just fucking happy for his friend. He dives on his friend there, they're celebrating, he's thinking that there's going to be a bunch of people in there any second now because the fights over, he's thinking they're gonna open it up and Bruce buffer is going to step in. But no would have been Bruce buffer is another organization.

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       But you know what I'm saying, whoever their of Bruce buffer is. But then somewhere along the line he realized the fight hadn't been stopped. And then I think he got very upset. He said because he has seen people take unnecessary punishment and he felt like that guy was done and he felt like to not stop the fight right then would be a terrible thing. And I totally see his point of view. That makes sense too. That makes sense to just, you can't, you can't push officials. You can't jump in when you're not supposed to be there. So mistakes were made, but, um, I don't know what you do about something like that. I Dunno how you, I dunno, like fifth standard punishments for Shit like that. But it'd be a shame if that instance took, uh, a Conor fight away from the fans. I'm not saying he shouldn't be punished. I would just say if he was punished, it would be a shame. I mean, I guess you have to set a precedent. I don't know how that works. You ever shove an official Jamie?

Speaker 3:          00:13:43       No, I've definitely yelled at him. No, but I mean, playing basketball, right. Fighters. You can talk to an official, right?

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       Yeah, man, they're real strict about that. Like when people do, they get very upset and you definitely can't put your hands on them. You know, Roy Roy Nelson just was pissed off once it a late stoppage and he, uh, he kicked a big John McCarthy in the butt, but it was like the most gentle kick ever. I mean, he didn't kick him like he was trying to hurt him, you know, he like touched his foot on his butt. I mean it was nothing and big John said it was nothing but he shouldn't have touched him. It's all it is. It's just there's rules and you get crazy. And it was the same thing. In fact a big Roy was pissed that he um, he let them take so much punishment.

Speaker 3:          00:14:30       Something similar happened this year in the NBA. The Steph curry is one of the top players. He's known for throwing his mouthpiece when he gets pissed. He always takes his mouthpiece out a lot when just one play is not an action. So he does well for whatever reason, something happened in the NBA finals last year, he turned around and tried to throw it a at like the the scores table and it hit a fan.

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       That's so nasty. It's definitely really gross. I mean it's just like a UFC fighter throwing it into the crowd. Like some nasty mouthpiece. I nobody wants that. Some fighters, oh no, this is, some people would dive for a UFC fighters mouthpiece, but if he's throwing it at a referee that's like spitting in his face. Boy, he bounced off the ground and hit him I think is to what happened here. Oh, like he didn't, I don't know if he even meant to throw it at them, but either way he shouldn't be thrown his mouthpiece and he's pissed. It's sort of like, but he didn't get suspended, which a lot of people were saying like what do you think? Early in the year you should have at least got a three or four game suspension, not just a $50,000 fine, which is a 10th of what he makes that day probably.

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       I don't think anything would happen to you if you're a fighter and you three your mouthpiece at the ground in front of a referee. I think cause the rev, the UFC is so violent that that would be taken as like, oh come on, throw the mouthpiece on the ground. But I think in basketball it's probably a pretty big deal. Right? Definitely different. I mean you can't, your spit your gum, Adam can't spit at people. Man. Wow, that's different. I mean we are taking off your head bailing, you're spinning at people. You're just throwing it with your hand, that things all slobbery and shit. You know what the fuck you doing? So gross. Anyway, I all the hands and sweat and blood and everything. Just going around the court. Is it a satisfying know to take out your mouthpiece filled with spit and hit someone in the face with it as it is to spit in their face?

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       Never done either, to be honest with you, but I don't know it in the face thing. It's a dangerous move. Haka Big Louis. Yeah cause you gotta be close. Real close. It's a bit, it's like, uh, it's like I'm ready for violence move. You spit in someone's face like Ooh, that's not just an insult. It's like the only way to respond to that insult is like something more intense. It's like there's always like a moment when someone spits in someone's face with, is this like terrifying moment of anything could happen here? Like how does this go? Does this swing left the swing? Right. How does this go?

Speaker 1:          00:16:46       But in MMA, like that happens, I mean you're, you're involved in these violent altercations. If someone just through their mouth piece of the ground, like you barely even notice it, you know, you couldn't do it at a referee. Like obviously it a referee, they would warn you or something like that could, maybe I'm wrong. Could you throw a shadow punch or shadow kick and buck. I was never going to hit him. I wasn't even close, but like, no, no, no. That's threatening. That's threatening. You know, if you, if you fee like fake kicked, even if you were five foot away from someone, you're kind of threatening. You're at the very least, you're doing something that's totally unnecessary. Like why, why would you do that? You're doing that to elicit some sort of response from the referee. You're trying to get them scared, trying to get them to realize that he's in the cage with a trained killer.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       You know? I mean, seriously, if you're in the cage and Frances and Ghana, who's mad at you? Direct three. Ah, what a fucking terrifying position you'd be that guy. He's a smasher. He's just a super athletes at Emory happened in the history of MMA, like in a big fight in a cage or that a fighter's gotten pissed and taking us from, I've seen it happen in boxing I think enough few times just doesn't happen often obviously. But I think UFC fighters credit, I don't think anyone has ever taken a swing at a referee. I don't think that's ever happened. I don't think so. Okay, well that's good. Yeah. I think that like if you, if you stop and think about how many fights there are and how few even like bad situations or are in between fighters, I like to think that even though it's a super intense

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       endeavored to do be fist fighting another person, male or female, like for the most part they're like really friendly people that do it for the most part. They're very, you know, they're, they're accomplished there and they don't have any time for bullshit. But lately there's been this trend and I think it's because Conor McGregor has been so successful with it of shit talking to like the nth degree, like who can be the biggest shit talker? And Colby. Covington is just going for it, baby. He's fucking going for it. And I got to tell you, I don't know how I feel because part of me thinks it's entertaining as fuck. When I read some of the shit that he says and I see some of the shitty says like he is just going for it, but it's working. See, here's the thing, and this is one of the things that he said.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       Got To understand like a lot of this is your true, just trying to get your name out there and you try to do something that makes a splash. Even if it's a band splash, even it's like pissing off the entire country of Brazil. He's making a splash, you know? And I could see the point that like you shouldn't do it that way. I get it. I get people saying that. What I don't get is people saying that they're not paying attention. I'm paying attention. I'm not encouraging it. I'm just being an, I'm a analyzing it from an outside perspective. As a person who's a huge fan of the way Conor McGregor talks, shit, I enjoy it. I fucking enjoy it when Jeremy Stevens says something to when he goes, who the fuck is that guy?

Speaker 1:          00:20:07       He's um, he's a magic man with that shit. I think he's amazing. His fucking timing, the things he says, he's a character, he's a fucking character and he fucks people up. There's no denying that. You know, Conor McGregor is a beast and I think probably not even in his prime. I mean, I think his athletic prime might be a couple of years away. I mean he, who the fuck knows what that guy can accomplish? But one thing that's clear is that he's changed the landscape when it comes to shit talking. Like now everybody wants to be a shit talker now. Shit talking. It's like it's mandatory for the Gig. You know, shit talking is become some thing that like, it's like an art form in and of itself. [inaudible] some guys are just going for it. So Colby apparently got into it with Fabrizio Verdon because one thing about Brazilians, if you talk some shit about Brazil, they will get really mad at you. They're very proud. They're very nationalistic. They'd love Brazil. And I don't know if that was what the argument was about, but for breezy over doom hit Kobi Covey to with a fucking boomerang.

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       See, the problem with that is I don't think for BC was trying to kill him. Right. But the problem with that is that's a weapon like that. It literally is what it is. Like it seems like it's goofy because it's, uh, something that we have when we're kids, you know, it never really works. I can give you ever got a boomerang to come back to you. Like, come on man. You can't just stay in the same spot and get that boomerang to come back to. Is Anybody ever done that? Can you really do that? For sure. I've seen it happen for sure. You got to do it up in the air or something, the way you throw it. Yeah. They could just go right back to you. See if you can find a video of someone to actually getting a boomerang to go right back to the same spot where he stands. They do that you can do with the Frisbee to, I seem like I do it with crazy frisbee. So like they invented it so they can kill things with it though. They invented like throw at birds and shit. So this is a real weapon. Like you're literally, you literally hitting the guy in the head with a weapon. I mean, I'm not, I'm not looking at this guy that's Australia is fuck, what's he got to say?

Speaker 4:          00:22:24       And the boomerang. We'll come back and then we just demonstrate for you. That's, that goes English. How you see it. Boom. Raise was straight out. Oh, I fuck dog.

Speaker 1:          00:22:33       Which is it? All right. He got Ya. He got shot. He got Ya. I believe someone probably can, but the point is, it's a weapon. So it's like co Colby got hit with a weapon for dude hit him in the head with a piece of wood and apparently he punched him in the phase two. According to Colby Covington, this guy looks like he'd be really good at a boomerang. Let me see it. Come back. Oh Shit. Look at that. That's fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       Oh, flew away. All right. Yeah. I mean, is this bullshit too? It comes back to the vicinity that you're in. Sorta like a, I mean, I don't know. Like even if you send a falcon nine on and off and come right back to the same gps spot that you left it, let it go from, but pretty, pretty close. Yeah. How does that work? Falcons who just didn't know what to do. I have no idea on that. So this dude is like a boomerang expert. Look at them just whipping that boomerang. How long would you have to practice to get that good at a boomerang? That is what? A weird fucking weapon. And he couldn't catch it. You couldn't catch it. But what a weird thing. Yeah. You know that someone figured out how to do that. Like how smart were those? God Damn people. Like how many different shape today come up with a w. Okay. If you had to guess, how long do you think the boomerangs been around? Thousands of years. Abi. I would say

Speaker 3:          00:23:51       it's gotta be one of those accidents someone figured out and was like, Whoa, look at that and just throw it right. Hey comes back, look at that. It comes back.

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       Yeah. But do you think that like there's a conventional academic view of like when it was invented, it must be right. So you could find that.

Speaker 3:          00:24:08       I just heard that there's this, the one, one of the most popular VR games or VR experiences, I think I it to, you probably done it called tilt brush, that virtual painting experience I just saw yesterday a tweet that said it was started as a, the guy who made it start out to make a three d chess game. But a bug was found that one of the pieces was dragging a light behind it or whatever. And he's like, oh look at that. And now he made the most popular VR thing. There was based off of a bug that so similar to someone could just throw on a stick and be like, hey look. I said, hey, this is what comes back to you. What could we use this for?

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       Right. SORTA like how they invented Viagra cause we were trying to come up with some blood pressure medication or some shit. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Like hey, hey, hey, I want to knows when no one knows for sure how the returning boomerang was invented. Mm. Anywhere cold. We got hit in the head with one. I don't know how that works, man. That seems like a salt. I mean that's like, I know he wasn't trying to kill him. If you watch the video, let's see if we could watch the video. Boom. Right. 25 to 30 to 50,000 years ago. Wow, that's a big gap. Yeah. They're like, um, I dunno. Threw a bag of like he just bought it or something. I think someone might've, yeah, he might have bought or someone gave it to him or something. They give you boomerangs down there, but he's got it in the bag and he just fucking whips it. He hits him in the like side of the head. He hits him in the shoulder and the head and Colby still talking shit to him.

Speaker 3:          00:25:30       Did they give out boomerangs like blaze and Hawaii? Is that probably show up. They give you one.

Speaker 1:          00:25:35       Yeah. Colby. Like when he hit him with it, he's like, whoa. Yeah, this is crazy. That just happened today, right? I think so. I just found out about it like right after the last podcast was over cray and they talking crazy shit to each other. We don't have to broadcast, they shed talking. I find it rude and vulgar. It's weird man. It's like some people like it, some people like the trash talking, but to these two guys are obviously in different weight classes so they're never going to fight. But some people like this like tough guy conflict that fighters have with each other and some people hate it. There's some people that think that some people are martial artists, you know, and they think that this is all like offensive, that you should conduct yourself like a martial artist. And some people have said that and you know, a lot of people like agree with it and think that this is the better path for this sport for all of us. But there's no denying the entertainment value of being a shithead.

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       It's entertaining. You know, I don't want people to fight, but I am entertained. Often when they do, I think we'd all be better off if they didn't fight. But there's something about like, John Jones going, I beat you after I did cocaine. Like there's something about that that, yeah, it's not like, it doesn't feel like the embodiment of the true spirit of what we would think of as martial arts being a vehicle for developing your human potential and the path of the Warrior Samurai and the noble poet. You know, we have all these like quiet Chang Caine views of what martial arts are. But one thing that martial arts are, is a psychological warfare as well. It's undeniable that it has a big impact and who you're fighting, you can get emotional. If a guy fucks with your head too much, you can get to a point where you're at a character and you take chances.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       You shouldn't take your nervous beyond like your ability to control because you're so worried about losing it. This person that they have this big emotional investment with, that's real. I mean that's one of the things that me and molten Musashi used when he was a sword fighter in, um, the book of five rings. He would talk about all the different games that he would play. I people have documented it like when Musashi would have these duels, he would show up like hours late and let this poor fuck just freak out worrying about a sword fight that he was going to have the guys sitting there for hours and hours. Then finally Musashi would show up and the guy would be like a nervous wreck and he would just fuck them up and kill him. And he, he had all these tactics that he used and that was just one of them.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       So psychological warfare is something that's always been a part of the martial arts, but some people feel like the most noble path for both warriors is just be respectful and just have no, no emotions on the line with this in terms of like, uh, a hate for each other. Instead just respect each other like warriors and go after it. And there's been some amazing fights or guys took on that mentality. That's uh, you know, that's an, it's an interesting, it's an interesting thing, the way people express themselves when they're doing what I think is like the most difficult athletic endeavor, the way people get their express themselves. Do you decide, just put on a show or do you decide to be the stoic warrior, you know, who doesn't talk much and takes care of business? It's interesting, man. I go, we were talking about steep bade.

Speaker 1:          00:29:15       Me, Oh church before the podcast, I was going back and forth and Steve based, he pays a fireman, he's the heavyweight champion of the world and he's also a fireman. He's the baddest man on the planet. He's the UFC heavyweight champion of the world. He's smashing people and he's also a fireman. You know, like that guy doesn't get enough love. Like that's the, that's the heavyweight champion of the world to, it's what a what a weird position that guys in, you know and couldn't be nicer but you got to think what if he was like a crazy shit talker would have steep Emile chick was like Colby Covington just talking mad shit. You know, instead Steve Bay shows up to knock people out and he looks like he's in in line to like take the bus to get to work. Like he barely looks like he's about to fight.

Speaker 1:          00:30:08       He has like the most stoic relaxed expression before he fucks people up much like fate or did. He's got his own sort of version of that. I goes, one of the more amazing things about fate or his career was like he would be in the middle of a firefight, just a full on fire fight and he never let his expression shift. You never saw fade are like gritting his teeth and making a mean face fade or it didn't waste any energy. Maybe if you made one or two main faces in his career, I might've missed it, but most of the time he would be in the middle of these fucking horrific wars and pride with like just dead face, you know? I mean he in hindsight, especially since Keynes been injured so many times, he in hindsight I think has to be recognized right next to Fabrizio over doom as the two greatest heavyweights of all time, which Cain Velasquez is right in there in that mix too.

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       And if he wasn't injured so much, I would think Kane is probably the most difficult one for all of them. He just was when he fought for doom, not making any excuses for him, but I think he really didn't have enough of an opportunity to adapt to the Mexico City altitude. It's like extreme altitude and for Dune did a very wise thing. He got up there way early and he lived up there even higher than Mexico City. He lived up, he set up his training camp like way in advance, so he totally acclimated. So for the first time it Keynes career, somebody had a cardio advantage over him, which was crazy. And then on top of that for BC over doing, it was just the nastiest submission artists in the history of the sport. He tapped out fade or million enco he tapped out Minotauro Nogueira any topped out.

Speaker 1:          00:31:51       Cain Velasquez, those three guys have to be considered top three all time. So top three or five all time guys made a Taros tap. Three of them, excuse me, for for breezy. Over doing was tap. Three of them made a Tarald tapped a bunch of them too. You know mandatorial when he tapped Mark Coleman, that was gigantic for Jujitsu to show that a guy could tap somebody off of his back that was a UFC heavyweight champion and still a murderer like mark the hammer Coleman watch them in a Toro. Tap Him was giant, but it just got to think of how good for doom is for doom tapped minute Toro, he tapped cane, any tapped fader or so for Colby to talk shit to him like cheeses too.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       I want to see the rematch between for doom and Steve Bay. I hope they can make that. If for doom wins his fight, he decided to take this fight on short notice, fairly short notice for mark, Mark Teen Marchine. How'd he say it? Marching Tibora who's a very promising young guy and he was supposed to be fighting Mark Hunt, which is going to be a crazy strikers match I would imagine. But I'm Mark Hunt got pulled from the card. There's some concern about something that he said in an interview and he said that the UFC is uh, they wanted to remove him because of his lawsuit in the UFC was like, look, we, we've already paid you one point $6 million since the lawsuit was filed. Like you've, you've fought for us and made a lot of money since then. Like we're not trying to stop you. I believe that's what they said.

Speaker 1:          00:33:33       Pretty sure. I don't want to, I don't want to misquote that. But the point is like, uh, they decided for whatever the reason was to remove Mark Hunt from the car and, and Fabrizio moved right into it. And it was right after he just submitted Walt Harris so for resale is still in the mix and like having that quick win like that over Harris got a nice submission, beautiful armbar transition from the back. It was just nasty. His, his just so high level on the ground. I don't think people understand or appreciate it. He could do that to almost anybody. That thing is like his level of Jujitsu. He, he was a legitimate world champion in Jujitsu. He won Ahboo Dhabi. I mean for breezy over doom is just a straight up killer. His Jujitsu is at such a high level still like most of the heavyweights they get on the ground with him are going to be in deep fucking water is just the level of Jujitsu that he has is so high.

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       They're like the average MMA practitioner, you know the at a, at a high level has a really good level of Jujitsu but Fabricio Verducci is the guy that taps those guys. Like that's how good he is. He, if he gets anybody that's anywhere near his size on the ground that's competing in the heavyweight division, there is a huge likelihood that he has a massive Jujitsu advantage. And until you've rolled with a guy who has a massive Jujitsu advantage, you don't realize like how big the difference between like him being 5% better than you. Him being 10% better hidden being 15% for ratios, probably 20 to 30% better than anybody else in the division when it goes to the ground. So it's even if you're good and strong and you're athletic and you're quick, he puts the smush on you, you stay smushed, man. I give the Brandon verify.

Speaker 1:          00:35:22       It's a great example of that. Brandon Vera was a bad motherfucker and he's, he's good at the ground. He knows how to fight, he knows how to submit. He knows how to kickbox. He was on fire at the time, but Fabricio put the smooshed down on him. He got on top of that mount was just inescapable and he started smashing him for Bricio, super underrated Jujitsu. I think even though people know it's his strong suit and they know how bad ass he is when you watch like the shit that he can do, there's not a whole lot of guys that are like that as a heavyweight. There's not a whole lot of guys that have that kind of guard is on a whole lot of guys that are just so dangerous from everywhere and his striking has got really good too. You've got to think. He knocked out Mark Hunt with a flying knee, you know, and that's how he won the title.

Speaker 1:          00:36:06       He's a beast for received for doom is a fucking beast. He just got super emotional when he fought Steve Bay in Brazil and just really charged at him. Almost uncharacteristically aggressive and steep page is set it up and just dropped a bomb on him and knocked him out. But Steve Bay could do that to any living human, any living human that chases steep Emile chick around like that and Steve Bay can just stop and cork went on you as you're moving in. The only one I think you might be able to take something like that was like a prime time Mark Hunt like primetime Mark Hunt had like the greatest job of all time. Cro. COP head kicked him full on, left high kick to the head and Mark Hunt like barely wobbled a little. He was like wobbled a little like it might've went down to one knee for a second and bounced back up like that would smash people. Most people got hit with that Cro. Cop left high kick and it was night night, but there's a video of it. I'm pretty sure cro cop was wearing shoes. I think he was wearing shoes when he had kicked him.

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       He's wearing shoes. Yeah, that's crazy. They let Mirko Cro, cop Kitkak kickbox which shoes on pride didn't give a fuck. Look, see that he's throwing kicks with that. Boom. Hits him in the head. Look what happens. A little wobble. That's it. That's insane. You have to know how insane that is. Folks who don't know. I mean, that is crazy. Mirko Cro. Cop puts everybody to sleep. He didn't even make Mark Hunt sleepy that prime time. Mark Han had the most ridiculous job all time, the most ridiculous, ridiculous ability to take a shot, I should say, of all time, because it wasn't just his jaw anywhere. He just could take a shot. Just insanely, insanely tough for base over doom owed him. So you have to realize you we're talking about a straight up killer now and he's 40. It's interesting. He says, uh, he says he feels great though with guys like that. You almost wish they could get him on some TRT. You almost wish it was legal. Like the only they could administer it monitor levels. Because if for Breeshia over doom could do TRT, if we get out like TRT Vitor tight physique member that does the, those were the glory years of chaos. The TRT RTV tour years have you get a TRT ver doom. Holy Shit Son.

Speaker 1:          00:38:45       I mean, God damn, that would be insane. I wonder. Uh, yeah, there's tr TV tour and there's regular retort with the cross on his head. And then there's the first v tour, which was, uh, probably like some other Shit v tour. Yeah. Crazy. But that his prime man, like when he knocked out Luke Rockhold or when he knocked out Michael Bisbing or Dan Henderson in one round, he was just terrifying. He was just something different. Just smashing people in a way that like, was kind of stunning. Like wow, if he tourists never been better, he just understood more because he was older and experienced. And then when they let them take tests, his body was performing. Look, a young guy's body. So he has this young guy's body, but this old guy's brain and he just has incredible confidence from all his wars and he's been in there with so many just assassins and survived and lost and won.

Speaker 1:          00:39:49       You know what I mean? Vittores it's been around forever. So to see him on the TRT makes you go, God Damn Monster, I'm doing cheer team, man. You're not supposed to say that. You're not supposed to say that. But here's one way that a company like Bella tour or one of these other organizations could get ahead is if they allowed that. I don't know how they do that. I don't know if that has to be a state athletic commission thing, but if there was a way where Bella tour decided, listen, let's be honest here, fighters would be much healthier. Be able to get through their training camp better, feel more physically strong if we just allow them to do just a little bit of TRT. Well the, we'll monitor it. We'll make sure everybody's okay. Extend the career of a lot of the older guys. What's up with that?

Speaker 1:          00:40:42       A heavyweight Grand Prix. They just announced a big tournament. Yeah, they're doing some big crazy tournament. Ryan Bader is going to fight as a heavyweight. Came Mo's going to fight as a heavyweight big countries in it. Mitre own fade or rampage. Chael Sonnen's in it. Yeah. It's going to go like for a year or that they really don't know. I don't know what the schedule is. Um, I just saw the announcement for it the other day and I saw some pictures and I was like, Oh shit. Yeah. Interesting. Huh? It Trios. I like, um, Ryan Bader as a heavyweight. That could be interesting. Ryan Bader, we're not having to cut any weight. Maybe even putting a little weight on fast as fuck man. That might be his weight class. Who knows? You know, and Ryan Bader is the, he's the bell tore champ now some I get cut off in the back there.

Speaker 1:          00:41:35       Who was that? What happened? The picture cut someone off. Isn't that Frank Mir? I think that the pictures, Frank Mir, how dare they cut Frank Mir off you sons of bitches. You sons of bitches have some respects that frankly on the left have some fucking respect. Whoever edited that Shit's going to ask if you, have you heard any, I haven't heard his name come up yet to know that it's Kyle Snyder. He's a wrestler from Ohio state. He won the gold medal and the Rio Olympics and he's really young. He's only 20 when he wanted and he just won the 2017 Gold Bento for heavyweight. Uh, it could be to Russian and I guess he's, I've seen his name pop up a little bit, but I haven't heard any of them thing about him training with a particular team. I think he's done at Ohio state now. He went back to back like doesn't want to fight MMA.

Speaker 1:          00:42:18       So I was just googling it. That's why I was asking if you heard anything. It said that he wants to fight in the UFC and do the 2020 Olympics. Whew. You'd have to be matched up carefully. You know the thing about the 2020 Olympics, like, man, I got to think that would take up all your time. How would you have time to like kickbox and learn submissions? I don't know. I mean he's a bad ass wrestler obviously. It's, I don't know. I don't know what he doesn't know or what he needed needs to. Well, I think everything escalates, right? Everybody gets better. I mean there's, there's outliers in every generation like Michael Jordan type characters. But I think in every sport people get better. And it must be the case in wrestling too, right? It's gotta be, I would imagine, I don't know enough. I only wrestled for one year in high school and I quite honestly don't know enough about modern.

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       Right. But I could always call, call me up and he would school me on it. But I think like if you look at the level, like he's a great example. Look at the level of technical wrestling knowledge that [inaudible] has in relationship to maybe some of the earlier days wrestlers you're talking about a completely different level. Like one of the reasons why core has been so successful is how technical he is as a wrestler. How good he is. I cause his wrestling's [inaudible] like him Yoel Romero is probably number one like Yoel Romero meddled in pretty much every international match that he was ever in. Every international major tournament that he was ever. And he medalled the Romero was like one of the scariest wrestlers it's ever done. MMA for sure. There's no doubt about it. I mean, he was the freak of freaks. He beat Cael Sanderson twice. And who's one of the greatest wrestlers ever? I mean, you all were marrow, so fuck Rick. Did he, did he ever fight in UFC or anything? I remember hearing him when I was growing up. Cael Sanderson. Yeah. I don't believe you ever fought MMA. Could pull, pull that up. Find out if that's true. There was a fake MMA fight. I found out that, um, uh, the Russian experiment did God damn it. Why can't I remember his name?

Speaker 1:          00:44:26       I don't see anything. It just says he's a coaching after he wrestled. Yeah, it probably did. Probably decided not to. What the fuck's that dude's name? The giant guy. The experiment. I can't believe his name is slipping my, the giant Russian dude. I believe. I can't remember I said Carrie Berona. No, the one. I'm always talking about. What, how, what, how does that happen? Where does an idea go and just vanish? Why is it saying sleep experiment? No, the Russian experiment. Uh, he's the guy who lost a rule on Gardner Gardner. Jesus Christ. I can't believe. I can't remember his name. This is so embarrassing. I got God that was pull up. Look him up. No, those guys. Huh? No, the guy right about what? The group, the red singlet. Keep going. Keep it right. Right, right. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:29       That's him. Go to the webpage. Alexander Karelin. Thank you Jesus Christ. How can I not, I was coming up with some weird fake Russian names. We smoked pot before we did this. I'm sorry. Sometimes is not good for your memory. There's a perfect example because Carolyn is a guy. I've been a fan of his forever. He's just one of the scariest human beings that's ever lived. Uh, I don't even know what my point was. What was my point about Carolyn? Why would we be bringing him up? Oh, we had a fake fight. He had an MMA fight. Everybody was always like, wow, if that guy only fought MMA, it would be fucking amazing. And then he had like a pro wrestling match. I don't believe I W W it's not my, I'd seen it was like a fixed fight. I'm thinking it was like a pro wrestling type situation. And, uh, it just look weird to watch. But at the time, I think before Rulon Gardner had beaten him. He had one like, who knows how many fucking matches in a row. If you such a terrifying person,

Speaker 1:          00:46:35       he would scoop guys up by their waist and they would try to flatten out on their stomach to try to avoid being thrown the received video. Whoa. Did we blow out what happened? There we go. Yeah. All right. We're back. We had some issue, I don't know what the fuck happened, but we were talking about, uh, Josie Aldo versus Max Holloway to dose, which is only happening because Frankie Edgar apparently got injured. I do not know what the injury was. Do you know what the injury was? And James, did you disclose it? Stepping up? I thought it was a bunch of people that we're talking shit online. I was watching, uh, one of his, uh, Instagram pictures or the video that he made a bunch of people calling him a bitch for pulling out of the fight. Like these fucking kids like it of all the people to call a bitch. Frankie Edgar is one of the biggest studs it's ever fought in MMA. That guy's an animal. He's, I mean he's like one of the most durable, tough and like mentally strong guys in the sport. So when someone calls him a bitch, it's, it's, it's actually hilarious. It's like you read that, you're like, that is one of the craziest fucking things anybody could ever say. You called Frankie Edgar a bitch like that doesn't even make it. That's preposterous. That's like saying Joey Diaz is a hot chick or something. Just what he's saying, it doesn't even make any sense.

Speaker 1:          00:48:03       Like if Frankie Edgar is a pitch, do you know what kind of benchmark you ha you have set? Like you have to be more of a man than Frankie Edgar or you're a bitch. That is crazy. We're all going to be bitches. We will all fail. You're going to look at a nation of bitches if that's what you're setting your bitch benchmark, you're calling yourself a bitch. For sure. For sure. Because I guarantee you if Frankie Edgar's pulling out of a fight for an injury, you would have pulled out quicker. So you're more of a bitch than him. You'd have to be. There's no way you're less of a bitch or anything. Anything remotely close to him. When you're talking about a guy who's a former UFC lightweight champion in a weight class that he barely even cut any weight for, that was, he would walk around at one 55 and he won the title. He beat Bj Penn like get the fuck outta here. More than once. Big Cubs wants to me. Frankie Edgar is a fucking monster. He's an animal.

Speaker 1:          00:49:06       He's the wrong guy to be calling a bitch. She can't. It just, it just shows you how ridiculous people are online. WHO's Joe Nobel? You'll get it, bro. He's a bitch for pulling out. I guarantee you that's not true. I guarantee you if he pulled out of that fight, it's because he's fucking injured. Period. End of discussion. He's not a bitch. He's not afraid of anybody. And that's not taking anything away from Max Holloway Cause who's fucking awesome? Max Holloway's a savage. He's a killer. Straight up killer and not even close to his prime. Max Holloway is a long way away from his prime. He's way better now than he was when he first got into the UFC. He's continued to get better with every fight. Now he's the champion and he just stopped all though. And then when they offered him the rematch because Frankie Edgar got injured, they offered all do the rematch. So although took it now it's going to be Max Holloway versus all though too, which is still a huge fucking fight and all those, when he although got accepted, Max Holloway wrote on his Instagram, it is what it is like no big deal. Well what are we going to do? Like what you're about to fight the greatest featherweight of all time for the second time. And he's like, it is what it is. Like that's how bad ass he is.

Speaker 1:          00:50:32       He just figured if I fucked you up once, I'm gonna fuck you up again. Like in his mind, this is not a good fight. Which is hilarious. That's, that's what a beast Max Holloway is that he's facing. Joe's a Aldo and he's like, it is what it is. It's not what I was looking for.

Speaker 1:          00:50:52       Yeah, it is what it is. What a beast. Max Holloway is a killer. He's a fucking killer. That kid, he's a killer. It is what it is. You're fighting Josie, although he's coming to get you because you knocked him out to win the belt. He has a chance at revenge and he's like, it is what it is. He's an animal man. A fucking kid is the real deal. What's so exciting to him about him and said he's not even close to done. You know, he has massive potential and he could easily move up to one 55 if he wanted to. Like if they could, if if say Max Holloway wins this fight spectacularly and then starts talking about your shit about Conor McGregor and then moves up to one 55 I think Max Holloway can easily compete at one 55 if you wanted to do some sort of unification bout.

Speaker 1:          00:51:48       I think that, I'm not a unification bow, but you know a champion versus champion bout. I think for sure Max Holloway could, could be competitive at one 55 and Max Holloway's only lost in his career and was to Connor as the only loss he has on his record. That's what a Badass he is. And he was the only guy that went to decision. Frankie Edgar release a statement after UFC two 18 withdrawal Max. I'll see you down the road. Well, what's the statement? It's got a facial surgery to repair a facial injury. It says it's a minor setback. Oh, start trading in about six weeks. I wonder what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:52:26       Oh, maybe it's a phase problem, bro. It might be. I'm just saying facial surgery can meet a lot of things. You know, it can mean a, you got something wrong with your jaw, a which is not good. You could mean you got something wrong or your cheek bone, which is not good. It could mean you got something wrong with your orbital, which is not good or it can mean something to that. I don't understand. So if he's not concerned about it, maybe it's something I don't understand. Maybe it's not a broken something. Maybe like something was like detached or something need to be stitched back on. Yikes.

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       I think about all the elbows, people who've taken all the shit that gets displaced all over your face. Like John Wayne par. I sort of documented all the stitches that he's ever taken. Multiple time world Moitai champion. Just a fucking straight up savage from Australia and John Wayne par was still fighting. It's fighting for Bell Tor now. It's one of the bell torque on the Beltour kickboxing roster, but he's had, oh God, he's going to be pissed at me for not remembering, but I think he's had more than 300 stitches in his face. He's such an animal. He's like documented them too. I think they did some thing where chose John Wayne par and it shows all the places and they put stitches on all the places where he's had actual stitches. They like, you know, doctor demand. Yeah, and the pictures just straight crazy. You're like, you are in a business that's shreds your face.

Speaker 1:          00:53:57       Yeah, that's it right there. That's all the different places in his body where he's been stitched up, which is just incredible. I mean, you look at his face, it's like a mask of stitches, but he looks normal. When you meet him, they did a great job stitching them up. I mean, it definitely looks like a guy you wouldn't fuck with, you know, and you want to fuck with a dude who a scars all over his face. Probably not a good move, but couldn't be a nicer guy. That was a fight that he had, whereas cornermen took that big cut on the side of his head and started making mouth many things with it and talking, Hey Martin, dear ms Mr. Caught, that's how morose these guys get. But um, you know, he's, he's still after it and that guys, you know, I mean it comes to like the amount of facial damage that he's received and delivered, delivered a lot of it too. Shitload of it. Yeah. Oh No. Who's that? Ron Stallings for? Suffers nasty cut eyebrows hanging off. That's the choir boy.

Speaker 1:          00:55:04       He's a very good fighter. That sucks. Yeah, there was a real bad one with Marvin Eastman. Vito Belfort hit Marvin Eastman with a flying knee, not a flying knee, but like jumped into it jump knee and just smashed him in the forehead and cut his eyebrow open terribly. It was like this really long cut. I was like, oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. That one. Pull that up. Yeah. That is a enormous cut. I mean literally, I mean four inches long, maybe third eyebrow. Yeah, like a, a huge third eyebrow going off his eyebrow and you see all the meat in there and everything and they have to stitch all that together. I mean, I don't know what happens with the muscles underneath it. Shit. That one was bad. What was that one? Is that it? Marvin Eastman. Oh my God. That's the other, the last tangle was even worse.

Speaker 1:          00:55:59       Go to that one right next to that one. Yeah. Look at that. When you see it from that angle. Ooh. It literally looks like he got attacked by a machete. Like someone stuck a machete in his head. Yeah, those are nasty. I don't know how we got to that and then how we got on that. We're talking about damage, you know, I dunno if we said enough about the, the Goddard Mcgregor thing, but it's, it's always, this is very disappointing. I wish he hadn't had done it, but I get, I get where he, I get how he thought the fight was over. I get why when he thought the fight wasn't over, he was furious. I get all of it. It's just very uncomfortable. Uh, and I think Goddard could not have handled himself better. That guy is a fucking man. I love the way you handle it.

Speaker 1:          00:56:46       I wrote love the way he wrote about it, the way he wrote about was like so clear and so concise and uh, it's the way he wrote about how taking control, like his job inside the cage when he was trying to do, makes you realize what a great referee he really is. Like how he's taking everything into consideration and following the rules even in the middle of chaos. But you gotta do, you gotta do, it's fucking tough job. That is one of the toughest jobs in sports to be a referee in a professional MMA fight. It's one of the toughest jobs in sports. There's so much craziness going on and it's so dangerous if someone loses the moment between someone getting hit and k out and being okay that to taking five, six, seven, eight unanswered blows and not being okay that there is a difference.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       There's a big difference in a great referee is very, very important and it's so subjective. It's so hard to decide when a guy's done. And how do you know and do you take into consideration how tough the guy is. Cause like Frankie Edgar can survive past the lands of doom where most people drown in their own fear. He survives past that and comes back and can win. There's guys like him and then there's some guys at once they get hit and once they get hurt, they're just, they, their ability to recover is not the same. And I don't know what it is. I don't know if it's just the person who recovered, didn't fight someone who hits hard enough or in the correct places to do enough damage where they couldn't return or if they're so damn tough, it doesn't matter who hits them or where they hit him, they figured out a way to make it back.

Speaker 1:          00:58:28       It's who knows? There's a lot of arguments on both sides, but man, you got to take into consideration like if, if you're watching, say a Frankie Edgar Gray Maynard fight and you go, oh my God, this could be stopped at any moment. It can be stopped, but it wasn't stopped and Frankie came back to when he had a draw in one fight, one in the second fight and the second fight where he won by knockout. It was arguably even crazier because gray Maynard was fucking him up in the first round. Again, like gray Maynard was a beast and he was huge for one 55 but Frankie Edgar got through that storm. Some guys wouldn't have in some referees would have stopped that fight and I don't know who's right. That's, I want to be really honest about this. I have no idea who's right. I don't know what the right move is.

Speaker 1:          00:59:16       I don't know if the right move is to let a guy fight and let them recover and, and, and give him every chance he can to win that fight. Even if it makes him take unnecessary damage. Give him the benefit of the doubt or err on the side of caution and safety and different fighters would have a different opinion. Um, you know, there's, there's, there was this archaic idea for a long time that is pretty much since been abandoned, but the idea was that if you tap from strikes, you're a bitch. It was a real thing. You know, that people would stick. And George Saint Pierre his face because he tapped with strikes to Matt Serra. Matt Serra was just blasted him and he was on top blaspheming. Him and George knew he was going out. So he just, he had a tap. Matt Serra was a Kol artists too.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       He could hit fucking hard. Um, but when you tap to strikes, if you, you know, if you know that you're not going to recover, I think it's a smart move. I think we have the wrong way of looking at it. If we denigrate P I know, I know they do it just to talk shit. I know it's a, I don't, you know, you're testing someone's courage but I think between fighters there should be a difference between the shit talking that fighter's engage in and then the way that other people analyze the actual sport itself. Because I think if you analyze the actual sport itself, you can't see anything wrong with tapping. It strikes if you're a, you're a pundit, you're a sideline or you're an MMA fan, your eye, in my opinion, if you really trust you guys' judgment as a champion and as a high level fighter like George Saint Pierre, as you can't be upset if the taps, the strikes, it's cause he's getting fucked up and he knows it like the you want to you and Jay check, she said she didn't tap the strikes.

Speaker 1:          01:01:03       She said she was moving her hand around. It looked like a tab to me. She was getting smashed, though she might not have even known she was tapping. She might've been in a a memory short out circuit or she's getting blasted, blasted, blasted. So if she even remembers tapping, who knows? She's getting cracked, man. I mean she got clipped with that left hand and then rose gets on top of her and starts dropping haymakers on her, which was boom, boom, boom, boom. And you see her reach over and tap right as a referee gets in and rescues her. And she might not have meant it. She might've been just, you got to realize when you're getting smashed in the face like that, everything is chaos. It's fireworks and sparks. And every situation is different. In one situation, you might have a guy who was fully aware of what's happening and knows exactly what he's doing.

Speaker 1:          01:02:00       He's getting bombed on, but he can get through it. Versus a person who gets hit and from the very first shot, they don't know what the fuck is happening. They're just on Queer Street. They're gonna fail. They don't know where they are. They're like, whoa. And you can't see it from the outside. The only person who knows is the person that's getting and you only person who knows their ability to recover. Now how much is that his psychological, how much that is their fighting spirit, how much of it is physiological guesswork? No one knows. It's a combination of all those things for sure. 100% cause you can't just have the physical and you can't just have the mental. If you have the mental and someone has the physical way better than you, you have to have all of it. It's a big, there's a, the, the idea that any person could be an MMA champ, it's like Ooh, I don't know cause everyone that's a champ is fucking super ups exceptional.

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       If it's not just physically, it's physically and mentally like it's not an easy game. It's a crazy fucking sport. And who knows if you want a chapped, it looked like she tapped. Who knows if she realized what was going on, you know? Did you see that thing about that football player that was diagnosed with CTE for the first time while he was alive? We sort of glossed over it. When we were talking to Dan Carlin, this is the first time a living football player has been diagnosed with CTE and ask what it was, but it says there unnamed. Mm. Yeah. I wouldn't want people to know, I guess man, they're saying that even high school kids have it, but high school kids who play a lot bang heads a lot. You're going to get it like that is, that is so hard to deal with. You think about how many people play football, how many people box, how many people fight, how many people are going to walk out of that thing? Does God's Ville

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       and how many people are going to be really clever like mighty mouse and avoid the damage and just have a technical understanding of like where to be and we're not to be what's coming next, how to, how to keep somebody's thinking, how to overload their, their, their mind with possibilities. You know, it's like you've got two different styles. You've got that style. I think these super technical upper echelon of MMA where he's like get super aggressive and picks up his pace towards the end of the fights and wind up finishing guys just had a just excellence like that crazy um, suplex to arm bar thing that he did on um,

Speaker 1:          01:04:42       ray a goddamn it. What's his name? Ray Borg. The taz Mexican devil. I fucked that up all the time. And when I do the Wayans I call him the Tasmanian Devil. It just comes into my mouth like an idiot. But Ray Borg who's a very good fighter and very tough and fast man when mighty mouse just put it on him, it was like you're watching an artist, you're watching someone who's just clearly head and shoulders technically above anyone in this division. That's why this fight that Tj is asking for, it gets really interesting. Tj Dillashaw versus mouse is going to be one of the greatest fights of all time. If they could pull it off, they actually wind up making that fight. Holy Shit. Will I be excited? I'll be so excited. Cause I think this would be the first time in a long time where mighty mouse has been challenged.

Speaker 1:          01:05:34       I mean you've got challenged by Ian. Ian Mccall had him in a really bad spot. Um, he certainly been challenged by other fighters. You know, he certainly like fought fighters early in his career where he had like really good fights with them. Joseph Benevidez but at the stage that he's at now, he's like, he's so fucking, he sell advanced that I think it takes someone like a Tj Dillashaw like a real super confident world champion killer to give him the fight that we need to see. Cause if Tj really can make one 25 and he says he really can make one 25 then holy shit. What a fight that is. Ooh, that's a good fight because TJ will have a giant power advantage. Right? I mean Tj is knocked out Hanan Barao Tj is knocked out. Cody Garbrandt in his last fight, TJ avoided all, all the chaos that John Linacre brings into the cage.

Speaker 1:          01:06:36       Tj avoided all that. He shut him down. Like TJ right now is operating at a real high world championship level. And the only fight that he lost, he lost to Dominick Cruz by the narrowest of margins. Some people don't even feel like you lost that fight. The, there was an argument that if you look at the damaging blows that he landed more damaging blows to Dominic picture it. Particularly if you factor in the leg kicks. So it's a, it's arguable that that was it at the very worst, a draw that was a such a close fight to call. That's arguable. Or you could argue the Dominic one too. But the point is he's a lid git world championship caliber fighter. Like TJ is a fucking killer. He's a killer. What he did to Hennen borrows insane. And then what he just did to Cody coming off the deck and Kale and Cody Garbrandt like that.

Speaker 1:          01:07:27       That's fucking insane too. He's in rare form. So him versus mighty mouse is the fight. That's the fight where you go, Holy Shit. Which one of these guys is arguably the best fighter in the world? Cause right now we think it's mighty mouse. But that's that thing always moves up and down. Like who's the best fighter in who? You know that it always moves around. Like when Jon Jones wins and knocks out Daniel Cormier, you go, damn, you almost want to give it to John. Like he's easy in a deeper shark pond. You know there's more killers. He's fighting Cormier who's just as good as they get after beating rumble after holding the title and John Kay, awesome. You got cop hand. You almost have to give it the John. But then John test positive. So you're like what the fuck man. So here's the heat. It's John and DJ, right? Demetrius is probably my ideas. Number one cause and John is in the situation where he's probably going to get suspended or something. But then you got probably Tj, if not George Saint Pierre GSP

Speaker 3:          01:08:34       moved up on the official list. Did you go to number one? Number two

Speaker 1:          01:08:37       Oh of course. That's interesting that you give them that with one fight against Michael Best Bang. That just shows you how bad ass you have to be to step in and fight Michael Bisping after Michael Bisbing knocks out Luke Rockhold, after he had beaten Anderson Silva defends his title against Dan Henderson and he just jumped in there and beat him and then jumped to number two and the pound for pound rankings. Like, welcome back, man. It's crazy. So what do you think about all that stuff? They're having all this, uh, these conversations about who's ranking the fighters and that the organization shouldn't be able to rank the fighters. Like do it, shouldn't be able to make the matches.

Speaker 3:          01:09:24       It's done technically right now through a writer's right, but mostly writers is it, I think are, you can see who the writers are, right? Who writers are voting panelists. I'm sorry, but they're all people from, let's see. Yeah. But at the end of the day, logs and whatnot, do you have see decides what they're going to do right now? At the end of the day, they go, yeah, you guys are cute. Listen, George Saint Pierre is going to fight. Michael Bisping shut the fuck up. It's going to compare it to a, just something that came out this week, the way the college football at friends, they're big playoff as they have a panel that takes into account all of the official rankings that are done, a couple of computer rankings. But then at the end of the thing, it's still the seven or eight people are going to decide that this team is ranked over this team and it really comes down to money. Dick matchups they want to see and what they can sell in ads, but they don't officially say that. It just creates more posts that like why did they do this? We don't understand it. And they won't say it was that Kinda, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:10:19       well it's the UFC has the ability to do whatever it wants and they're in a situation and this, here's the argument for it. During the situation where they just bought this organization for $4 billion that need to make money, motherfucker. So think going to have Tyron Woodley fight Nate Diaz. Like, Hey, I was going to do some paper review numbers and it will, that's an interesting fight. I like to see it. I'd like to see, uh, I'd like to see how Nate deals with the biggest, fastest welterweight in the division, the biggest knockout artists welterweight in the division. I mean there's no doubt about it. Tyron Woodley is a tank. He's a tank who throws missiles your way. Boom, boom. And he's gotten very tactical. People got mad at him for those two Wonderboy fights. But I, I suggest that they don't truly appreciate what those fights represented. They represented extreme consequences for any mistake.

Speaker 1:          01:11:17       You're fighting a guy who's like one of the best counter strikers on the planet earth in Wonderboy. He's one of the sneakiest slippery just strikers in the sport. He moves like a world champion karate guy who also has takedown defense and he's got a ton of experience in MMA now and he just fights weird. He throws front leg roundhouse kicks to your face, he jumps in and hits you with shots you don't see common cause he like has that blitz karate style that he employs sometimes very difficult to hit. His hands are always down low and Tyron managed to not just beat him and they were boring fights. I'm not going to lie to you. They were boring fights, but they weren't boring to me while they were happening. It was boring in terms of the overall result because it was a five round decision. We're not a lot of exchanges took place, but it wasn't boring when I was watching it.

Speaker 1:          01:12:08       And this is why it's because now that you know that what, how it ended, you'll just sit through the fight and go, oh my God, this is boring. But when you don't know what is going to happen, they don't know either. And they're making these decisions and they're so evenly matched that they're canceling each other out. And Tyron is doing a very smart thing by not engaging and he's not doing too much because if he does too much at leaves these openings and he doesn't want to even remotely risk that, he's going to put himself in a position where he gets open and wonderboard catches him. So he makes Wonderboy do all the leading. And then when the bombs get dropped on both occasions, Tyron Woodley was the one that hurt Wonderboy, which is crazy when you think that Wonderboy is one of the best kick boxers it's ever fought in MMA.

Speaker 1:          01:12:52       He had some insane kickboxing record. I want to quote it out of the top of my head. I think it was 57 and [inaudible] 57 [inaudible] as a kickboxer. He's, this is a guy that George Saint Pierre said was the best striker that he's ever sparred with. That's how God damned good Wonderboy is. He's, he's, he's another level striker and those two fights between Tyron Woodley and Wonderboy, essentially we're striking exchanges for the most part, except for the first fight, the first fight. Tyron did get him in a gay teen for awhile and it looked like he was burning his arms out. Like you couldn't believe that wonder boy you got out of it. But the point is that in the points, in the moments of the fight, we're one fighter was in trouble. It was always wonderful and that's enough in my eyes to give tiring the decisions for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:13:44       Just the just that if we want to look at what is a fight, I think the current system of like 10 points, nine points, it's too flawed. It's a, we adopted this from boxing we that we should have a way more comprehensive system and I think it should be a system that's probably over a hundred points or up to a hundred points rather that you have points for significant moments in the fight. Like maybe significant moments when someone gets dipped that accounts for a certain amount of points, significant moments where a person almost get submitted and figures out how to power out that accounts for a certain amount of points. Do they power out and wind up reversing the position cause that should be worth a certain amount of points. You know there should be an accumulative effect. It shouldn't be just like you want or you won. She'd be like, how do you know who won?

Speaker 1:          01:14:27       Like can we look at the stats? Can we look at the numbers and then can we look at it from an expert point of view? Cause every punch does not have the same impact at other punches do. Every kick does not have the same impact that of the kicks do. And every submission doesn't have the same probability of succeeding. So if you're watching all these things happen, you need real world class experts to assess what's happening at any stage of the fight. Like you should. The only people should ever judge a fight. Our guys like bat Hume who used to judge for pride, guys like Duke Roufus like worldclass guys for Rasa Hobby. We could, you could get that level of martial artists to judge fights and I think you'd have the opportunity to create a totally new system that's not boxing base. Cause the 10 point must system is just so flawed.

Speaker 1:          01:15:15       Have a new system and just only have high level worldclass martial artists and nothing less do all the judging cause they don't understand what the differences between someone just taking somebody down and someone taking someone down and threatening them. Someone who's on the bottom was winning with elbows or was threatening with submissions. Maybe they don't understand how close these submissions are. Some people don't know what a triangle is locked up until it's a fucking tap. You know, there's, if you've never sparked a day in your life and you watch someone who's tapping someone with a wrist lock, you're not going to know what the fuck is happening. You're just not most likely unless you're a real efficient auto that's just never physically practiced it. Most of the people that are referees, unfortunately, or I should say judges, there's a lot of them, I don't want to say most of them.

Speaker 1:          01:16:02       A lot of them are real martial artists, 100% but there's quite a few that were sort of grandfathered in from boxing and they don't necessarily know a whole lot about MMA. Now, this is not representative of the vast majority, but I see them every now and then and some of them were very nice people and I say, Hi Mike, how you doing? I mean, we're just talking disagreements on things and maybe different levels of appreciation for what's happening, but some we get every now and then you get a decision where everybody looks at. Everybody was, what in the fuck does that just say like everybody, you, me, everybody look over at Tony. I look over at Jon Anik, he'll look over at me. I look over at Daniel Columbia. He'll look over at me and were like, what the fuck? That shouldn't happen. That shouldn't happen when all the experts are in agreement that this is a bad decision.

Speaker 1:          01:16:51       Now we're not talking about like debatable moments. Like there's fights where you look at it and go, man, I could see the argument for this guy winning. And then the other guy could say, well I see the argument for that guy winning and I'll be like, damn, you got a point. You know like Brendan and I will do that all the time. He'll, he'll make an argument for why he thinks that Conor won the second fight easy. And I'll make an argument and like, I don't know man. I don't know about all that. I mean we're not using the same system back then when someone got dropped, it's not an eight a ten eight thing. Right. It's not like they don't give away ten eight rounds as quickly back then. I'm pretty sure that was the old rules wasn't not God damn it. I should know that.

Speaker 1:          01:17:29       Anyway, point being, um, some people think Nate could have got to draw on that fight and I'm like, maybe, maybe it wasn't far enough away. We couldn't see that it was one of those where like Bob, maybe this has been a bunch of fights like that and I could see the argument for Conor winning 100%. He hit him quicker, faster, harder one the first rounds bigger, you know. But man, I don't know. We're adding points if you just doing this ten nine thing that occasionally 10, eight, but now most of the states are adopting the full new MMA regulations and as they do that we're going to get a much better, we're going to have a much better uh, range of rounds. Like what would around scores as which is a good step. It's a good step in the right direction. I just think it is an incredibly critical part of the sport is who judges the decisions.

Speaker 1:          01:18:21       And that again is not to disparage anybody who's currently doing it, but I think it is a position that should be held in the highest of esteem right up there with referee. I think this position is, is, uh, it's crucial for the future of the fighters. It's crucial for the legitimacy of the sport itself because when bad decisions happen, people get angry and they question whether or not the sport is legitimate. And that's dangerous to the respect that the athletes face. Like, here's a perfect example. Canelo Alvarez versus Gennady Golovkin everybody was a boxing fan, knows Gennady Golovkin won that fight and last year a huge Canelo fan and you just, you're just absorbed in Canelo. You love him. If you watch that fight, Golovkin seem to control way more of the fight that Canelo did. It didn't mean a Canela didn't win rounds didn't mean Canelo didn't land good shots, but he lost he, it seemed to me that he lost and they didn't give it to him. Golovkin didn't get the decision. It was a draw and people were watching it going, what the fuck? And that's what Brendon called in advance. Brenden's shop called it in advance. He's like, and let's go Lufkin wins by knockout. He's never women in decision. And I go, you really think so? He's like, fuck yeah, he nailed it. He totally nailed it. When, when they read the draw, I put my hands on my face like Macaulay Culkin home alone. I Wa oh, you fucked him. Who fucking not Eagle Love Kid. Oh, you got 'em.

Speaker 3:          01:19:54       What do you think of the, when they did the instant replay at, I think it was the first time at the UFC in New York. I didn't know Walt Harris fight. Yeah, it's a good move ma'am. They keep doing that or is that only a one time kind of thing?

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       I don't know. They should keep doing it. No, it wasn't Walt Harris, right. Wolf. Which fight was it? They said they did it because of the massage. Aussie Weidman fight. Right. And then they used it. I guess it got used though during those two fights, right? Yeah. It was Juan Harris fighting and it was the other fight. Um, uh, it was Demir. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I came into play and was used properly, probably, right? Yes. It was. Well, the wall Harris things. Very unfortunate. And he had kicked that dude. Um, but the other one a owes Demir got knocked out by, who was the gentleman? Austin. Tamir was fighting.

Speaker 5:          01:20:38       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:20:41       don't try to remember. Look it up. I was like, I was there. I can kind of remember. I remember him like being pissed that he thought he'd knocked a loss. Then you came in and told him that he didn't actually lose. Is that the duty? Fobts a beast. Um, this is a weird time. We're at time for the sport man. Like a, this is like a transitionary period, I feel like. And uh, Connor is such a gigantic star that he's almost eclipsed the sport. Who Was it? It wasn't, it wasn't. No. Oh. Volkov owes Demir is the guy who's going to fight. Yeah, he's going to fight. I'm like, that's hilarious. Just pull up the last card. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:21:32       17.

Speaker 1:          01:21:35       It's not Alexi Oli nick. Actually that sounds right. Is it Curtis blades defeated Lexi Olin name Curtis blades. Beat the shit out of him. Yeah. Oh, that's right. Curtis blades is a really interesting prospect, is a big, big kid, is super athletic, and he threw a, an illegal kick, but it literally just touched the ear. That was the god Beer Walt here. That was the illegal kick and that that was God be Your Walt Harris. Yeah. The other one was a doctor stoppage. Right. But wasn't there something that happened in that fight? There was also a controversial, I think he was beating him up and then there was a, I can't remember how it stuck. I think it was who did God be a fight? He fought Walt Harris. He got head kicked. Correct. Right. And God beer got the win on this. But then when Curtis blades, he accidentally kicked him in the ear or you just touched his ear.

Speaker 1:          01:22:28       Referee stopped the fight after blades delivered in an illegal kick to down the opponent. Yeah. Doctor called in to check to see that that kick barely touched his ear like he was already done. Yay. Right? Yeah, he was hurting really bad. Curtis was putting a beating on him and when he went down Curtis through this wild kick and just touched, I mean literally touched his ear, it did not hit him, but the referee saw the contact and then went to the instant replay to make sure that it was okay. But as soon as the referee saw the instant replays, like, okay, clearly he's okay. But the doctors looked at him and they asked him like, dude, this guy's fucked up like this. This fights over. And I think he said that it was over.

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       He said he couldn't continue. I was bringing that up to begin with. Could do you know how the instant replay worked? It was like, did they all just get into a huddle and watch the video or is there someone, I can imagine the referee probably right.

Speaker 1:          01:23:17       Watches it and they probably watch it with like Mark Ratner, one of the officials, you know, and they, they look at it and make a, an informed decision, you know, and I don't know what the parameters are that are, no, don't who gets the call. But I would imagine it's a group. I would imagine there's very little disagreement when someone's looking at film like that cause they're not biased. They don't, I mean these guys, if you have John McCarthy and herb dean, they're looking at film, I guarantee you they're going to agree and what it is and it's uh, there's a lot of dispute dispute about that kind of shit. You know, it's, it's really important to have those guys that are like completely on top of the rules. Like there was one fight where, uh, Tim means fought cowboy Olivera and he hit him while he was down.

Speaker 1:          01:24:00       Do you remember that? And we were trying to figure out whether or not it was legal and I believe it was Dan Merkley, Yada. And we even got mark Ratner on the air and Mark Ratner thought it was illegal knee cause he was down on one knee with one foot and no hands. He's like under the new rules that would be legal and big. John McCarthy says, no, it's not. If anything from your feet other than the soles of your feet are down on the ground, you're still a down to Poland. And I was like, oh. So he had explained it to me after the fight because everybody was called it three points of contact, but Olivera literally did not have a foot on the ground. He just had his knee, his foot was up in the air and his other foot was touching the ground. And he got kneed in the face and we got kneed in the face.

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       They said it was an illegal nay. And we were like, how is that the case? Cause there's, there's only two points of contact. There's the knee and the foot. Like you're not talking about Nia foot. And the hand is just two points of contact. But apparently it can't be anything other than the ball. Your feets. But it could be is you have the both balls of your feet down on the ground, but you have one hand down that's three points of contact. And under the new rules that would be legal under the old rules. If you touch the ground at all, it's illegal. Super confusing. Right. So in that one, it was really important to have a, a referee like big John Waite. And right there. Yeah. See he smashes him like see how he's got,

Speaker 3:          01:25:38       yeah. The need means more than one. Right. That's what they're going with.

Speaker 1:          01:25:41       Well I think when it landed that right foot was elevated and was off the ground,

Speaker 3:          01:25:49       then something similar happened. Where did the guy delivering that needs like lifted him up off the ground. Yeah. Get them off the ground yet.

Speaker 1:          01:25:55       Yes. Yeah guys have done that to lift him up off the ground and slammed ease into their body because they were touching with their hands. You can do that. That's legal. It is a weird a rule. It's a rule that we're going to have to figure out what makes sense because the knees to the head to a down deponent. I feel like that almost makes sense because that is a real legitimate move. And if someone can do that to you, why is that different? Is it too easy? Like why is that different than being able to elbow someone in the face when they're on the ground?

Speaker 1:          01:26:33       Cause it hits harder? Is that what it is? Okay, so it's better. So I can't use it because it's better. So you can just elbow me all day long in the face, but you can't name me in the head and put me out on my miseries. I don't know who's right or who's wrong, but it's an effective martial arts technique and they've eliminated supposedly for the safety of the fighters. But you got to figure out like what's legal and what's not legal. Like here's another thing, and this is a fascinating fight that just took place between Matt Brown and Diego Sanchez. Crazy wild fight. As long as it lasted. Matt Brown lands this fucking beautiful Elbulli palms him away and just boom, drops this beautiful elbow on him. I mean it was just picture perfect and Diego goes limp, like a sniper. Just shot him from the sixth floor depository.

Speaker 1:          01:27:21       I mean it was perfect. It's like the perfect Kao. But Diego was complaining that it was the back of the head. But here's the thing, nobody gives a shit if it's the back of the head of your standing up. Watch this, boom. Look how it goes. Limp. I mean that is Diego Sanchez is a fucking warrior dude for him to go limp like that. Look at this. Boom. Totally on the back of the head, but that's okay. When you're standing up, that's, it's weird if you punch something in the back of the head, like when Matt Serra Fought George, I'm pretty sure some of those shots he blasted him with, he hit him in the back of the head. It might've even been the first one because if you're swinging sometimes and your hand goes around like your hand hits the back of the head all the time. Head kicks, head kicks hit the back of the head all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:28:10       I give you neck kicked. Somebody. Like if you go over, like say if someone's standing with her left shoulder to you, have you go over that left shoulder and dropped down with that kick, that neck kick shit that a lot of time it goes in the back of the head. That's a lot of times where it's landing. It's coming around. You're coming over the short. You're literally slamming your he foot the instep right into the back of that dude's head and that's a hard fucking impact from a leg happens all the time. It's totally illegal. It's weird because if you get on the ground, they'll go watch the back of the head, watch the back of the head like even from the mountain. I mean even for the guard, rather. If you're in someone's garden, you're punched him. Watch the back of the head. Everybody's watching the back of the head.

Speaker 1:          01:28:54       How about protect the back of your head? No one says, watch your eyes. What? Don't hit the eyes. You don't say it on hit eyes. Be The back of the heads off limits. It seems like a good spot to hit. Like what do we do it and I mean, well it's so dangerous. It's everything is dangerous. This is fighting. This is MMA. Look, it's we shouldn't, you know what works the best if you can elbow someone in the back of the head sometimes. How can we can't do it all the time. I'm not saying that anybody should change that result. The result was perfect. Matt Brown by Kale. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is open it up. Let guys do whatever they want to do

Speaker 1:          01:29:34       and no gloves. I'm tired of saying this. Take the gloves away. No raps, no hand wraps. That would save a lot. You would not be able to get away with nearly as much. Everybody would look like John Wayne par though. You'd be all cut up. But I just think it's more realistic. It's just so weird to me. He put pads on your knuckles, but you're allowed to elbow someone in the eyeball. Oh, you're protecting your hands. Oh, that seems like cheating. You should be like, if you only hit someone with your hands so hard, that should be how hard you can hit them. Shouldn't be able to fucking put them in a cast. I mean that's what you're doing. You put them in like a soft leather covered cast. That's what that Margarita fight was. You know when Margarita got busted with Shane Mosley when they found a cement and his gloves, I took it too far. But that's what it is. You're, you're, you making it so you can hit someone harder. It hurts almost as much. It doesn't have the sharpness to it that someone has when they hit you with bare knuckle. Bare knuckle has like a sharpness, but the amount of power that someone can generate just w with no regards to their own safety is more, they can swing drop bombs on you. That

Speaker 3:          01:30:54       copy cause of that picture. They saw it and I do not know. Did they see it there? You could see it there. I mean it's hard to tell what that is and that's what that, that's what that other picture was sort of alluding to. Can you make that bigger? That's far as it'll zoom. I think it's hard to tell what that is. That could just be the gauze that's all wet. I mean it's after the fight it looks like a crack. I guess that's what they're trying to say is like low. Really. I mean, I don't know that Gosh shouldn't crack like that. Right. I should rip

Speaker 1:          01:31:20       Yo. Imagine if that's the case. What if it really did turn into like hard shit? Like real plaster.

Speaker 3:          01:31:29       Whoa. I don't know how they found it. Yeah. I mean how did he get caught?

Speaker 1:          01:31:32       I don't know either. I think they uh, someone from, cause that's how you catch sugar. Shane Mosley's team watched him, watched him wrap his hands. I think you're allowed to rap, watch your opponent, wrap their hands. And he noticed something in the wraps and had it pulled out. So then everybody decided that that's what he had been doing his whole career, which is why he had been smashing people cause he had been smashing a lot of people. He just had more power. More pop is loaded. Gloves. Prior to the 2009 sugar, Shane Mosley, Antonio Margarita fight Mosley's trainer Nasim Richardson was in the Margarito dressing room so he could observe Margarito his hands getting wrapped prior to putting on boxing gloves. As Margarita is trainers, we're wrapping their fighter's hands. Richardson noticed what appeared to be a plaster of Paris powder on the wraps. Don Tom. Ah, the plaster of Paris hardens when it comes into contact with moisture and any fighter will sweat during the course of a fight. Oh Shit. As soon as Richardson saw the substance, he accused Margarito of fighting with loaded gloves. Margarito his hands or rewrapped and Mosley hammered Margarito he did too. He beat the shit out of him that day. I bet that dude felt guilty.

Speaker 1:          01:32:51       No one that you were going to try to fight a world champion like sugar Shane, but you try to change up. Yeah, that's not good. But I think that bare knuckle would be different. I think it would be better for submissions for sure. Way Easier to secure. Chokes your hand slip behind things way easier when there's no gloves and it'd be way harder to hit somebody. You, you would have a really hard time if someone duct and you hit the top of their forehead, you can easily break your hand. Like people break their hands all the time and that way. Um, what else did I want to talk about? I think that might be it, dude. We covered it all. Although Max Holloway, we covered that a little bit. I want to see if, although still can compete at a world class level and improve because you know that he can compete at a world class level. You've seen the last few fights that he's had. He's still, I mean other than the fight that he had with Connor were Connor starched him. Did he fight Frankie Edgar right after he fought Conor? I believe he did. I believe that's who we won the title from.

Speaker 1:          01:34:07       Is that who it was? Yeah. And he uh, outboxed him, you know, he fought a guy in Max Holloway that's at the top of his game, top of his game for now and with more height to come. But I mean, he's just peaking. He's ramping it up right now. Max is a fucking beast. So it's interesting to see whether or not all though can recover and he doesn't have a full camp for this fight either. You know, he had to take this fight on, um, I want to say four weeks notice. See if that's true.

Speaker 5:          01:34:42       I don't want to lie, but

Speaker 1:          01:34:46       I think Max Holloway is one of the best up and coming fighters for sure. In the world, a world champion. When I say up and coming, I mean up becoming in like the pound for pound sort of a way. I mean he's just greatness written all over him. If he just keeps up at this pace and he's got the attitude, he's got the skills, he's a straight killer. But you can't look past and old warrior like Aldo. Not saying that he is, I bet he's not. But um, everybody else can't look past it either. Although still fucking super dangerous. He's going to be real motivated in a wind by all though would be to [inaudible] John, I can't tick at this stage of the game. If although could bounce back the way he bounced back from the Mcgregor fight, an outbox Frankie, if he could bounce back in some way, figuring out what he did wrong in that first fight and solve the puzzle.

Speaker 1:          01:35:39       Whoa, that's big. That's a big fight. And the other fight we talked about, um, Tyron Woodley and Nate Diaz does the other one. That's crazy. Five days ago I found that it says he was supposed to fight Ricardo Lamas, uh, two weeks later. And now he's been bumped up to this. So it was only five days ago they made that fight. Whoa. And so he only has two weeks then. Yeah. So yeah, November 11th she's confirmed auto replace Frankie Edgar. So I guess that was when they announced it. Jesus Christ. That's crazy. Well, I hope he's training a lot. I hope he's in great shape. I hope to weight cut isn't too much either because he's a big guy. At least he was for awhile. He leaned out quite a bit because I think he was having a really hard time making that cut from like well into like he looks like he's about one 70 something and they would cut down to one 45 and real hard for him.

Speaker 1:          01:36:35       He would suffer in the last round, the fights like uh, if he didn't smoke guys early on, sometimes he faded towards the end like he did with Ricardo Lamas. Like the end of the fight, moss was on top of him. Like he had done enough to win for sure. But at the end he was fading. He's getting tired. And I think a big part of that was probably just getting the water sock data. You know those guys, they tortured themselves, man. The card for this weekend, Dun, Dun, Dun Dun Duh for doom and to bore is interesting. I like that Tim Means and below Mohamad. That's a serious fight. Some good fights on that card. All right, and that is when Saturday, yeah, Saturday night. Saturday night in Australia. Oh Shit. Oh Australia. I'll be in, I'm going to be in Phoenix. I'm going to be in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm going to get to see a Mike Goldberg.

Speaker 1:          01:37:27       I haven't seen Mike and Forever. He's killing it in Beltour man. I like the fact that Bella tour exists. You know, I love the UFC. The UFC is my home. I'm not doing commentary for anybody ever. The UFC is like family to me, but I think competition is important. I think it's important for everything. I think the systems competing with each other make some greater. I think the more opportunities that young fighters have to perform and fight, the more you're going to see higher and higher level of ability and performance level fighting knowledge. You just, there's more, competition is a higher level for the UFC. It's higher level for Bella tour, everybody is going to accelerate. This is a growing thing right now and as long as you're not competing with each other on the same night long, they don't do anything dumb and that fights in the same night.

Speaker 1:          01:38:18       I think they compliment each other. I really do. I think there's some fighters that will do better in Beltour. I think there's some fighters that prefer to be in the UFC. It's all good man. It's all good. You know the UFC has way more worldclass fighters, but bell tours got some tough motherfucker, some real legit worldclass fighters to now and their, their rosters growing like Rory Macdonald's is one of the best fucking welterweights on the planet and he's over there now. I hope we get him back. I really do. I love commentating his fights. Lorens Larkin's over there now. A llamas. Like there's a, there's a bunch of guys, Diego, Lima, um, I think, uh, Lima is, or Douglas Lema is one of the best fucking Walton weights on the planet for sure. His brother Diego, I think it's still fighting for the UFC, but there's a bunch of town over there now.

Speaker 1:          01:39:13       Like real legit talent. It's good. It's good for everybody. It's good for the sport, gives people opportunities, makes people raise their games up for the athletes. The more Michael Chandler's are out there, the boogie man in the woods, Michael Chandler is a boogie man and 155 pound division. He's terrifying for everybody. It doesn't matter what organization you fight for that guys, straight up killer. So this like, there's enough really dangerous worldclass fighters over there in Beltour for it to be excitingly competitive for everybody. I think it's good. And I liked the gold. He's got a Gig because I love him. Uh, so I think that's it. I think we did more than an hour. We're going to call it the hour, but I'm blabber mouth motherfucker and I can't stop talking. Um, I don't feel the need to apologize for anything I said. I don't think I fucked up and offending anybody. If I did, I'm going to blame it on the weed. Anything to add young Jamie? Nope. I think that was a good first episode one. I think we'll do this more often. Okay. I'm not, I'm not guaranteeing every week, but we'll keep it close. All right. Bye. Bye.
