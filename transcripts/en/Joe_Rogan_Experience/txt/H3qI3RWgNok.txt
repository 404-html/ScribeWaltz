Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Four, three, two, one. Kelly slater, we've been talking about doing this for how long? Couple of years. While for having me. Thanks for being here. I'm glad we finally got a chance to do it. What are you in California for? I know you broke your foot, right? I broke my foot real bad. I have to do that. Might. Well my girlfriend's from San Clemente and her family lives there and uh, so we kind of live here. We're not moving around too much so I'm just going to here right now. I'm not competing. I broke my foot. I was surfing in South Africa about 15 months ago and I was just on a wave that I wouldn't consider a very big wave. Nobody would really considered dangerous and it all kind of closed out, which is, you know, when it all breaks at once, I just pulled into thing because I was going to sort of wash on the rocks right where that was and change boards and uh, I was practicing.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       I had to compete and about two hours from then. So I was just testing out different boards for some reason I wasn't riding the board, I was planning on writing competition so I was going to come in and change and switch to my norm board and I just pulled this wave and just, I kinda hesitated like usually you either ride those out and stay on your board or you jump off and I was kind of between the two and I kind of lifted my front foot off my back foot. My leg was straight because I was kinda going to think I was going to jump off and as my foot got my leg got locked back straight. The board flipped in. Oh, against the toes. And it just broke the top of my foot and a half. Like immediate. Like there was my guy. Yeah, we're looking at a photograph of the expert right now and it's like every bone it's snapped.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       Well what you can't see. So do you know, are you aware of the Liz Frank joint niches? Like that's where the first big metatarsal comes together. So that first big joint on top of the foot there. Why is it called a Liz frank joint list? Frank was a doctor, I think is what I am. I could, we could look this up. I think that was the person that did the original surgery when you used to break your foot in a stirrup back 100 years ago. They used to cut your foot off. Oh God damn it. Ah, so, so that was, what was it? Uh, that was kind of how this sort of joint got famous. But normally what happens is those toes, those two bones right there, the first and second metatarsal can either spread or converge one way or the other. And that's usually what a liz frank fracture is.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       I had the best of the three, which is, I had a crack. You can just see on the right side of. Yeah, if you go down with the cursor right there, just a little lower. There's a little crack right there, uh, right there on that corner. And then the next one broke across. You can just see right there. It's cracked across. And then so it kind of went in a line up and across the foot. And then the other two are just destroyed. The third one displaced the fourth when shattered into eight pieces. The doctor said he lost count putting them back together and then, you know, you, you would know from injuries. The problem with when the shatters of bone, they're not getting the blood flow. So it's not like a four or five week repair job. It's like, that was like nine months before that thing was together properly.

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       So when they do that, how do they piece that shattered one back together again? A delicately and they put like a mesh over. So I got to kind of like figure out how to. Well I had, I had a plate on the list, frank, and then it had a plant play, a kind of a bridge across the third and fourth. And so they kind of meshed it all together. And then, uh, I think I had 16 screws combined in all that. God Damn. Um, it was, it was, it was brutal. The problem with it was I did it in South Africa where I wasn't going to get surgery, so I had to wait for the swelling to go down for about six days before I could fly. Oh God. Because they thought it was going to swell too much because it was already swollen from the event.

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       So I shit on my foot for like five days and sat there and watched. Unfortunately the waves were perfect, so I was sitting on the beach as watching perfect waves and you know, it's like, that's like as painful as the injury to a surfer, you know, it's like watching a bunch of elk walked by in front of you and, and not, not scared of you. And uh, um, so I sat there because the whole time prior to me being injured while I was there for like two weeks, the ways weren't very good. So I broke my foot in the way he's got great. Oh. So I had to watch it, so it's, that's painful for us. But uh, so then I waited for the swelling to go down and then it's too red eyes to get back. Was there no way you could get it fixed in South Africa?

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       I maybe could have, but then I was probably looking at St Africa for a month or more in and also I didn't know that the quality sort of level of quality of doctor I was going to get there. And I got a doctor I work with here and I called him straightaway. I said, look, it's my fourth broken foot, but I've never broken it like this. Usually it's like let it heal for four weeks. And you're surfing and it's all from surfing. Yeah. In offering the same way. I'll really, really pretty much the board going back against the foot fall. Um, because. And usually it happens when I'm, you know, I don't know how well versed you are in surfing, but when I'm tube riding and usually with my back to the wave, which has happened two or three times. So I'm in the wave, the lip pitches over and lands.

Speaker 1:          00:05:06       But when that lands it sends a shock back into the way. Like, you know, when the lip hits flatwater that lip, some of the energy goes down and some disperses out and up and some comes back into the tube, so if it does that and you're in the wrong spot, the board will flip into your feet, but oh wow. Normally what we do is we were, when you rubbed backside barrel ride, a lot of times you're grabbing the rail so you kind of have both your feet and your hand on it so you can handle that shock, but if you're just going no hand backside, it's usually pretty big intense barrel and so that lip has a lot of energy and it shoots a ton of force back towards you. And if, if it hits your board just rolling, it can flip in your foot and break it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       Do you know anybody else's broken their foot like you like that? Not this bad. I'm one guy on tour broke his foot. Pretty bad knee requiring surgery this year. That looks horrible, man. How long was it before you can walk? You're walking. Totally normal now. So how long has it been since the surgery? I had surgery in July last year and then walking normal wasn't until maybe December, January. Well, December I competed again, but I probably shouldn't have, but we're, we're at pipeline in Hawaii, which is, you're not doing maneuvers. It's not a small wave kind of competence. If the waves are small, I wouldn't have served since it's bigger. It's a little easier because you take off and kind of trim a straight line. So you're kind of going straight, you know, even though you're writing the barrel, you're kind of going straight, but are you conscious of your foot being compromised?

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       Yeah. Wow. I don't know. I just, that's my favorite event in the world, so I just didn't want to miss it. But fuck. If you broke your foot again. Yeah. But then you know, the bones were pretty good back together then. And I could walk somewhat without pain and if I put myself in a real vulnerable, vulnerable, vulnerable position on a wave, I would kind of maybe jump off, you know, I wouldn't really push it. It's not worth winning a contest, dillon foot again, but I'm sure to be able to surf pipeline with no one out is kind of worth the risk. Now when you are healing, is there anything they give you that can accelerate bone healing or is there any. Supplements are. A lot of. It is kind of. I mean it's the furthest place from your heart, right? So. And it's, it's down at the bottom of your body, so you got to kind of get that foot up.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       Like a lot of times I'll sit against a wall and elevate my foot and let it completely flush out. You know when you're a kid and you kind of hold your hand and somebody pushed all the blood out of your hand, you ever do that one? No. It's like this trick where somebody hold your, your, your, your arteries. So No blood's going in, you push all the hands, all the blood out and then you let it go and it's like a little spider web feels like if somebody goes like that, it was killing a spider web. I did do that when I was a kid. So it was forgotten, I just kind of imagined that's what I was doing with my foot up and like, oh, okay, all the blood's getting out of my foot now and I'm a. But did you like research whether there's something that accelerates bone healing or you can use magnets.

Speaker 1:          00:08:03       Magnets, yes. Some people believe magnets help increase the circulation and thus the, the uh, especially, uh, rotating magnet because it kind of creates a force field around your foot. Really? Yeah. Supposedly, I mean, around the magnets. Is this like, are these legit people are, these days are like theories healer's healer, energy healer. While I'm just saying what I've heard people. So the first time I broke my foot, a guy, a chiropractor, Guy I had gone to, he's like, just when you go to sleep, it's not going to hurt, you just put her on your foot. And I was actually competing, uh, five weeks after I broke that foot. So I don't know if it helped or not, but I just asleep and it was near my foot and maybe it helped. That takes six weeks for a bone heal, right? Doesn't it? When you're on to take four weeks and then it takes two more weeks for the calcium to properly fill in.

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       So like the. If you take an extra after four weeks it'll still look like there's a whole, like a break there, but apparently the bone has sutured itself back. But if calcium has not filled in to make it totally strong. That's what I was told by my doctor on this last one because I asked every question possible why is it still look broken? Why is it. And he was telling me, you know, it's not till you get enough blood flow and then it's. And then it's once there's the proper blood flow in the bone, then you get the calcium coming back. And the only thing that I've heard too that really is supposed to accelerate healing is a hyperbaric chamber. Which I didn't do. I had one sort of at hand in Hawaii I could have gone to, but I didn't know I was supposed to.

Speaker 2:          00:09:37       I know that Uriah Faber use that a lot after he fought Josie Aldo, although kick the shit out of his leg and his leg was really badly. Swollen was horrible. No Bra. Did he break the bone? No, it didn't break the bone, but it was. It was so bad. It was like his left leg was literally twice the size. And remember Paul, I've seen the. I've seen the flight photo. Are you talking there it is right there. There's a photo and in the fight you're talking about. Look at the color on his leg. It was so nasty. That was. Although when he was in his prime and he didn't see those kicks, you couldn't see his kicks coming. He was just like, he doesn't even load up it just there. That's probably right afterwards. It must've felt broken. It feels fucking horrible just to get hit once, man.

Speaker 2:          00:10:20       I mean, you're right. It's so tough to just take that over and over and over again. Like he did. Was He. Can you check those and what it can you turn it into? Um, the problem is when you get hit what just getting hit once by a guy who's really good, like a peter or, or someone who's like a really good leg kicker, they hit you once and you're, you're not even going to lift your leg upright. Well, think of a Charlie horse, that guy gives you in school when you're a kid and how bad that, that's probably 10 times out of 10 times whatever it is. There's a Nesto who's probably one of the greatest lessons, not probably, definitely one of the greatest lake carriers of all time. And there's a video called the perfect leg kick by Ernesto, who's then it just shows you like a compilation of him landing leg kicks in people and you just see like you see their, their, their legs buckle.

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       And, and he would walk with him. He would whip it down like he had this angle. They said, yeah, he's a long, tall guy. And his technique was just perfect. Oh no video of him. He was so good. Watch his left, left kick or left kick and then left hooked rather than the right leg kick. The way he goes, you're covering up top and you don't mind maybe even see it. Hook. Look at this though. Being the, just the, the whip into it. He was so good, man. He was so fucking good and he would always do it. Left, left hook to the body. And then right leg kick afterwards. Uh, Ricardo Arona a buddy of mine. You Know Ricardo? No Ricardo pretty well. Yeah. CSR for. Yeah, he surfs a lot of Brazilian guys surfing now. But who did he kick rampage or somebody in the lower leg?

Speaker 2:          00:11:56       Like I think Vendrell a, I don't know, back in the pride days and uh, I think he killed, broke someone's lower leg or something. Sure. He was the victim of the worst slam I've ever seen in my life. Well, he told me, he's like, I don't know why I didn't grab the leg. Yeah. And the thing I didn't realize because I had watched the fight before and I didn't pick this up. I wasn't very well versed at that time in watching fights, but he goes, he goes, Kelly, you know, the thing was I put him to sleep in the fight before that and I let him go and then told the rep, you sleeping, he's sleeping. And he goes, and then he woke back up and the rough kind of you can watch it and it touched them. Goes okay. Keep fighting. Yeah. What? Did he catch them with?

Speaker 2:          00:12:35       A triangle or something? I'm kind of trying. Yeah. Uh, no it wasn't a triangle was a teen or something. Might have been a good team. They were on the ground. So yeah. You like or maybe knocked him out, know I thought he put him to sleep or something. I don't know if it was. Anyways. Yeah. But then rampage woke up. Yeah. And then kept finding rough like, oh yeah, we'll pride was crazy. Yeah. They would have let you fight to the death. If I went to a. was it a k? One? I watched Kitty Yamamoto and an inhaler fight. Oh Wow. And uh, you know, I had run into hoist the night before. Just saw him at a bar and he's like, what's up? And I'm like, I'm leaving. I'm going to fly out tomorrow. He goes, no, you've got to come to my brother's flight.

Speaker 2:          00:13:15       So I went to the fight and then got knocked out. Man. It was. It was hard to walk. What did he fight? Hitler fought. Could Yamamoto. Yeah, that's right. That's when it was five. Yeah. He was getting involved in mma and he really didn't have any striking. Yeah, he was out cold for a couple of minutes. I was like, did they just offer him a shit load of money? Like why did he decide to take? I don't know. I, I, I, I had never met earlier at that time he fought. He fought a bunch of people. Sakharova, which is really crazy. And Sakharova had him in a Kamora with his arm way behind his back and they stopped the fight rather than let him get his arm broken because he wasn't tapping. Yeah. But he was like, mom, really flexible. Like I wasn't gonna tap.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       I can, I can do that. Yeah. I see some of these yogis. I follow this guy, this Yogi guy, and I think this guy named, uh, go Kula chondral or something and he, he, um, he puts these poses up and I think if this guy did Jujitsu, there's no way somebody could tap him out because he, he's doing, he's the craziest. I don't know how you put your. I've never seen somebody put their body in these contortionists positions and you just wonder if somebody who's a real true contortionists if they knew Jujitsu and how to escape things. If they could ever really get tagged with like arms, I'm sure next or gay teens or whatever. But what do you got here, Jamie? Oh, there was a guy thought we were showing us some. There's a guy named Ray who was, oh, look at this guy did follow this guy.

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       Yeah, he's, my God. It's insane. He does these poses where he's, he's balancing on his elbow and he said, and then the rest of his bodies in these poses. It's insane poses and stuff. One go above that, right there on the far right. Jamie. That one when he's on one hand, it's amazing. That's fucking nuts, man. Yeah. This kind of stuff and the strengths and the amount of time you had to take to learn these things. It's like, it's. I mean, that's sort of a martial art in itself. Oh yeah. Well, um, there's a guy who's a famous Jujitsu guy who once said that yoga is a martial art that you do against yourself. Yeah. There's, my friend Ray is a, he was a lead singer of a band re Capo. He was a lead singer of some punk band and then became a Yogi.

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       Hm. Yeah. And we called Yoga Ray and uh, he would uh, come to 10th planet and he would just, he could move in ways he likes without fuck. Are you doing man? Like his body was. So he had so much dexterity and flexibility. It was impossible to like hold them in positions. Like he just could move. Segue your two belts below me, but I can't pin you. Well, he was actually a very high ranking guy. He was really good at Jujitsu. He had this crazy yo and he also had amazing breath work. Like he, he, he never got tired, like his cardio is incredible, but it was all because of his, his breathing techniques. Hixson hixson would work on a lot of breathing stuff. Yeah. Yeah. He was like, I've, I've, uh, I've known Hickson quite a long time and he always talks about that when you breathe through your nose and how you calm your heart and you have to panic breathing through your mouth is what they would call know when you panic.

Speaker 2:          00:16:28       Breathe. Yeah. Yeah. Most people in their title. But he was always about control, controlling your breath, go. And he was like, you know, prior to him doing his thing and becoming sort of, well known, he hixon would go sit and cold ice cold streams and just real calm through the nose and control, you know? Yeah. That's in that movie choke. He's in a glacial river and he's just sitting, we're neck deep in and everybody else just dipped their foot. And I'm like, fuck this. Yeah, he's in, in the freezing cold water. Just loving it. Yeah. He's a fascinating guy and he was really the first guy that sort of introduced martial artists to the power of yoga because he was the best that stomach work he could do, you know? Yeah. It's like freaky freaky.

Speaker 2:          00:17:17       Yeah. We've played that. It's from the movie choke. Yeah, that's what it's called. A fire breathing or some blank breath of fire. There's like a word for that kind of breathing. It's probably more just if you'll go to a class and they'll go, okay, breath of fire is right. That's just like that. But he had his. He could pull his stomach in and move it side to side in some weird way. He said like he could use every muscle in his body individually, like move it independent of other muscles. That's a weird one. He also loves surfing. I Love Surfing. Given boards to for a long time. Really? Yeah. That's so cool. Yeah, it's amazing. How many Jujitsu Guys Love Surfing. Yeah, there's an endless. Is it just because of Rio and Rio is like just a place. It's they all sorta and and sort of played soccer and serve there on the beach.

Speaker 2:          00:18:08       So they're kind of doing these things and some volleyball with their feet, whatever you call that thing. Right, right, right. What is that? Slams are sick. It's crazy. But I posted a video of these guys in Thailand that we're doing that. They were playing volleyball, a version of volleyball with their feet and it's fucking wild man. It's like the ultimate hacky sack. It's the craziest shit. Like the dexterity they have with their feet where they're whacking the ball over and then the other guy on the other side is whacking it back and it's like they're catching it with their foot. Oh look at this angle is they get. Yeah. I mean the flexibility to. And these guys are really close to each other too. Yeah. That's must be some good fails that kicks into face. Sure. I'm sure there's a lot of that. What's it called?

Speaker 2:          00:18:55       Well this is Koreans are. Boom, look at that kid. Oh my God. That's insane. And then you have to fall in your hands and hope you don't break your wrists falling. I wonder if they got added a floor like a, you know, like a mat on Dojo. This is pretty impressive stuff. But Jamie, see if you find that video that I posted on my instagram page, I reposted somebody else posting it. It's fucking bananas because these guys are using this little shitty ball in the jungle and just the ability that they have with their feet is just out of this world. You ever hear of a guy named Sir Donald Brat? Uh, Gosh, I forget his name. Bradman. I believe it was. He used the best crooked player of all time. No, that's cricketer of all time. So he grew up in Australia. Outback and he, he, I guess from what I heard, there wasn't many people around and he used to play, uh, he would take a stick, just a random stick and he would hit a ball against a corrugated, curved a wall, corrugated aluminum, you know, one of those kind of bended walls and they use for roofing and uh, so the ball would just bounce off at all these different angles and uh, hit his hand.

Speaker 2:          00:20:08       Eye Coordination became like, you know, as good as you could possibly ever have because it was like his fun thing to do. Check these guys out, look at this crazy shit and I saw you look at this and off the head and it looks like these perfect shots, but they keep firing it back at each other. Look at that off the head and it sounds hard. It sounds like a coconut or something, you know? Right. It sounds like they made it at a like, like a rock and some fucking. Oh, how was that? How was that kicks? That was just straight up martial arts. It was like a push, kick, push kick, but a roundhouse kick at the same time. Like a push crescent kick.

Speaker 2:          00:20:45       This guy. I mean. Oh, and the block if you can get good at doing that. I guess it is tie because those are tie writing, but if you could get good at that man. I mean there's certain guys that just when you see them in Moitai they have. Oh, that's what it's called me. Seapak top gras. It's Burmese. Oh, okay. Soccer and volleyball put together. Yeah. Those guys would be awesome fighters. There's certain guys that have just insane leg dexterity that you see in martial arts. Like do you know sunshine is ever see Sanchez Sanchez leg kicks would be insane. Yeah. Well he's everything. He's, he's. There's a famous highlight reel of him where he throws this like fake knee off the right and then jumping roundhouse kicks this guy in the face and chaos and with his left and it's just the, the, the ability that he has to place his foot like anywhere he wants.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       His dexterity just out the world is a range. Would just be other worldly. Right? Yeah. Well that's. I mean, Tisha slept there. He is. Oh yeah. No, definitely younger guy. And he was essentially. I was talking about. They're asking about connor fighting. Conor. He ever see that thing? He's like, no, I'd kill this guy. Fuck him up so bad. Like he probably let it go. Okay, kick me a few times on this trade. Let's try it. A couple. He's so hard to hit to Sanchez. Just so elusive. Why wouldn't someone like him in, in a UFC fight? He doesn't know how to fight on the ground. I mean, that's all it is. It's just they just pin him with another standup guy. If they were smart, yeah, that would be the smart thing to do, but I'm not going to put Sam punk and gets another ground guy, are Ya?

Speaker 2:          00:22:22       Well, that's. That would be a disaster. Cm punk. That whole thing was everybody's like, I could do it. You know, you watch cm punk. You're like, fuck, I'll fucking fight. Like I guarantee you, Sam, Sam punks probably a lot tougher than the average guy anyway. I mean, I don't know. I don't know fighting, but you know, even in the average fighter, no nothing. Average fighter, but maybe the average guy in a bar, right? Cm punk is a real nice guy and I don't want to say anything bad about them because I mean the guy gave it his all. He really did. Totally, totally dedicated. I don't have some humble pie and he was totally cool about it. He was in these cool about it the first time and he was cool about the second time. He's a real good guy, but he doesn't have what I would call talent.

Speaker 2:          00:23:02       The skill just moves wrong. He doesn't see them against. When Mickey Golar came in and just went over the top and he was probably so nervous to never being in that situation of a real flight. I mean, he's been in front of the crowds, but that was a nightmare that micky gall fight was so ridiculous. Micky gall is fucking good. He's really good. He's fucking. And to have a guy like cm punk that doesn't have a back. It's not like brock Lesnar Brock Lesnar came to the UFC. He was a wrestler. He's a fucking gorilla. As a human being, just a freak athlete. Cm punk is a regular guy like he's not. There's nothing freaky about it. He doesn't have crazy power or weird speed. You don't see them and go, that guy looks super scary for a guy his size. I mean there's guys that don't look like sand.

Speaker 2:          00:23:48       Chai himself does not look like a freak freaky so frequently, but when you see him, he looks, he looks like an athlete, but he doesn't look like you know. It's not like Roy Jones Jr and his prime or something. When you see them, you just go, Jesus, so you're this fucking guy. He was just, I mean he's just so good. But a guy like cm punk, he didn't have a background and he tried martial arts when he was like 30. So he had no background. Not Real in the even wrestling background. No, he didn't even wrestle. It was all theatrical. Wrestling was all entertainment, you know, you would think though that those guys would even, even the theatrical reffing, they would go and work on the skill like day in, day out mean that's all you have to be as a wrestler. Right. This is such a difference, but you can work on the scale day in, day out and then work on skill and someone doesn't want you to do it to them. Yeah. That's the thing. And then when they're trying to do things to you, like, just fucking you up. Yeah. And just nothing you can do about it. Like in your mouth breathing.

Speaker 2:          00:24:46       Everything's wrong. But I mean, I'm sure he made a ton of money and he, oh, he tested himself, the guy, I mean give the guy credit. He really did test himself. I think it was a good thing for, for Dan and everyone to see, to like, oh okay, we're not going to do that. Let's not, let's not put someone in that position that's not put ourselves in that position. But they were talking about like Logan, Paul Logan, Paul fighting in the UFC, and he was like, Logan Paul and get killed. Logan. Paul is fucking way better, way better than cm punk. Logan Paul like actually knows how to fight. He had a boxing match with another youtube guy. But I was watching him throw punches in that fight. I'm like, this is a guy who actually knows how to punch like kids punches looked good. He gassed out. He got a little tired first real fight like that.

Speaker 2:          00:25:34       But he has a background in wrestling and he, he actually can punch. Like I was watching him punch this guy. I was like, that's a guy who actually knows how to throw punches. He now he knows how to, he knows distance and timing, he knows how to connect and he doesn't look like Canelo Alvarez or anything crazy, but he looks like a guy who can actually punch more. You can give him a break on that. But Dana is like, you know, have him fight in the UFC would be, he would get killed. Like I'd fucking cm punk fight. This guy is way better than him. He really has a background in fighting. How, how does that dynamic work for you and Dana were, you know, with something like that that, that can be seen if somebody is a little triggered, are a little sensitive, they might get a little bit like angry at you saying something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:26:16       Dana is the easiest going guy ever with that kind of shit. He doesn't give a fuck. He looked. Me and him have been friends for like almost 20 years. We've been friends for a long time and I've been working for the UFC. I mean I started working for the old company in [inaudible] 97. I started working for that long ago. Yeah. And then the new company, I started working for them in 2002 and I was friends with Dana before that. It's just he, he knows my heart's in the right place, but he also knows that if I wasn't honest nobody would listen to me. Yeah. That's the thing. I enjoy watching the fights and listening to your, your critical in a fairway with people I think, you know. Yeah. When you, when you critique what somebody is doing, it's like if they listened the right way it's probably going to help them.

Speaker 2:          00:27:06       Well I definitely don't say things that if I don't know what I'm talking about and I don't say things that I don't mean, you know, but if I see something and I've watched, I mean I've called at least a thousand fights. I don't know how many times or probably more. Yeah. And I've seen some of the greatest fights of all time up live in close. Right? Right next to the cage. You know, I seen a lot of shit. So if I'm saying something it's probably because it's right. I mean it. But if I don't know what I'm talking about, like it's one of the good things about having Daniel cormier there or dominick Cruz, if there's some aspect of fighting that maybe I'm not exactly sure about, I can defer to them and I could say like, wow, what's so important about getting the under hook here?

Speaker 2:          00:27:49       You know? And then cormier could go off about like, why this? And then you go, oh, okay, I get that. Okay, I see. I like that was a big thing in the fight with Steve and Daniel Cormier. Dominick Cruz was explaining how important it was that caught me a kept pummeling. He kept shifting positions and pummeling for under hooks and that was one of the reasons why I was able to land that big right hand because he was never static. He also had to wear something to get in there too. Then yeah. I mean he was writing Steve based face and she pays like, I mean that was such a great match. Even though obviously it didn't last very long, but I mean he, he took a few on the chin real hard to get in there. And uh, for Steve Bay has got to drive him fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:28:29       Like she's been tweeting a lot. Why wouldn't he get a straight rematch straight away? I mean there's even supposedly talk at mcgregor getting rematch when he got pretty much handled everywhere. I don't think there's real talk of mcgregor getting a rematch. I think the real smart money is on Tony Ferguson fighting Khabib next that Dane has been saying that I, I 100 percent believe that Tony Ferguson. I don't think Tony Ferguson should have ever been stripped. I think he should still be the interim champion. I mean, the guy fell while he was doing press and tore his knee apart. Six months later it comes back and destroys Anthony Pettis and spectacular performance. Fight. Pettis was great too. Fuck you. It was Tony's. Tony's just a warrior. I mean he's, he's cardio, never runs out. He throws weird stuff with everything you can throw currently got upset that we call them a Weirdo.

Speaker 2:          00:29:21       Like he's, I guess he's sensitive. He apparently got upset. I said it was a brilliant Weirdo like when he was on his way to the cage, but I meant that 100 percent complimentary ankle weights at the weigh ins, like I don't even know what I mean. He uses a wing Chung dummy. He sets up his, all of his camp, his training, and he sets it up himself. He puts the mats down. He builds his own like heavy bag hangers. He puts, he puts up Chin up bars, all that shit does it himself. He's like, he does construction like it's unfamiliar to the average training regimen. Yes. That's what I'm. I'm in a complimentary way. I'm a huge fan of that guy. I am too. I thought. I think he's awesome. I also think that he is the toughest test for Khabib because of his cardio and because of its versatility, because he could fight really well off his back when he submitted Kevin Lee off his back to win the title.

Speaker 2:          00:30:08       He's got a fantastic darce choke and his ability to hold guys in his guard and recover if he gets clipped. I mean he's. He's the most dangerous guy. Lightweight. For Khabib. I think, in my opinion, yeah, he just never gets fucking tired. It doesn't even make sense. And Eddie, Eddie trains them. He's one of Eddie's students. Eddie says he's never seen anything like it. He said, this guy work out six hours a day, full clip, everybody else's exhausted. He keeps going there doing sprints up the hill, 20 laps. Everybody keeps going. He's just. Cardio is off the charts. I wonder if that's a Mexican thing too. I think there's a lot of Mexicans that have amazing cardio, right? I don't know what it is, man. I mean if it's a running thing for sure, but I mean if you go back to Julio, Cesar Chavez, Aka baby, I think, I mean Gilbert Belinda said that wants to that.

Speaker 2:          00:31:00       It's a Mexican thing. It's cardio because Gilbert's always been known for his crazy cardio. I really wonder if there's like certain ethnicities that have an advantage or at least a better starting point and then it's all hard work from there. Yeah. That must. Maybe there's some genetic thing you can prove and the way that blood holds on to Diego Sanchez. He's another one. You go insane cardio. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I mean it's a, it's a, it's a fun thing to think about. I mean, you, you go, like, you go to back to boxing in particular. I mean, how many great boxers had fantastic cardio from Mexico, you know, Chavez in particular, Julio, Cesar Chavez, which is where guys down the volume of his punching. It was just never stopped. Just constantly on. You constantly moving forward, bobbing and weaving and throwing shots. And sometimes as an athlete, like if you're a boxer, you'd have to,

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       even if you didn't have that, you'd have to dig deep and pretend you had that, you know what I mean? Because then it starts wearing another guy. Like, this guy's never stop. You know, like I had a, uh, I had a situation once I was super winded, I was really tired in a, in a heat surfing in Tahiti and uh, this, this heat ended up sort of being like a world title heat for me. And um, I was losing with like two minutes ago and I ended up in this paddle battle against a guy and he's a good paddler and pretty fit guy and we're like head to head. And what happens, we, whoever gets back out first deemed by the judges gets priority over the next wave. They can have whatever the way they want. And with two minutes, three minutes left and a heat surfing, there's, that's not a lot of time to get a wave if uh, if the wave comes, you got to be the guy that has priority for it and we're. And

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       I could feel him just for half a second kind of lit up when his paddle like, okay, I'm getting ahead on this guy. And as soon as he did I paddle harder. And I was like, I, you know, to show him. Like I got more and he gave up and I got it. And then I got, then I needed like a score out of 10 points and I needed like a nine. I got like a nine point four with 30 seconds ago or something. It was just. But it was, I didn't have that in me, like physically I was like, I don't want to quit too, you know, but I was like, I got a poker face, this guy, I think I got more, you know, and I, I really didn't. It was just that choice. Like I don't care. I'm going to get out there with the lungs burning and I'll feel bad for 30 seconds, whatever, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:33:15       But sometimes I would imagine boxers, pro tribe or may guys for sure. Sometimes you can't bluff that, but sometimes you can't bluff it. But yeah, for sure it does come up where there's an edge one way or the other. That's a big thing with Ferguson, that pressure that he puts on guys. Yeah. He just never gets slow. You know, if you watched the Gustafson, a Jon Jones fight to John late, that fight, did you know? There could've been some doubt. And so people who winning that fight or it close fight, but look like John just started pouring it. He was three. Yup. Strikes in the last couple rounds. Yeah. The last rounds one him that fight. And by all accounts, John Wasn't in shape by all accounts. John Really didn't train for that fight and didn't take Gustafson seriously and kind of half assed his training camp and still pulled it off in the championship rounds.

Speaker 2:          00:34:04       That guy's livable and they're going to rematch. That's right. Yeah. That's anyway. Yup. The December card, it's January, New Year's Eve, you know, basically I think it's the December 29, 29 things. Fantastic fight. And because I think Gustafson's way better now. You see when Gustafson knocked out globally to share. I mean he just looked like there was like a video game. Combinational. Yeah. So I think that fight is a, that's going to be one for the ages. And then for John, his comeback fight for Gustafson to be the rematch he's asking for forever. And it will be for the light heavyweight title. They're going to strip cormier. Are they going to fight heavyweight in? Yeah, I mean he's gonna. He's fighting Derrick Lewis in December and weird flight. Well he's number two. I mean if you look at the rankings, it's not. If you look at Derrick Lewis is obviously unorthodox, but he was, he was just getting mauled in that last flight.

Speaker 2:          00:34:57       He doesn't matter when you go in, I guess in Madden when you get that last punch and the power that he has with his finger, you know, why am I, why am I even talking about this? But I'm just a fan. He really was the number two contender headed into that fight and then wins. I think that guy was the dark horse, that division. So for him to knock off Alexander like that, that's a jet was a giant knockout and to get his ass kicked for three rounds. Respect to to Alexander though. Yeah, for, for staying in the pocket. Fighting out with 30 seconds to go when he clearly winning Netflix. Well, he got hurt. He got hurt a couple of times in that fight. Did he just. Yeah. Yeah. There was one time where he lost his mouth piece and he tried to give it to Derek.

Speaker 2:          00:35:40       Yeah, that's right. I think he was on Queer Street. I didn't. I don't think he knew what the fuck was going on because Derek hits so hard. He, if you don't get knocked out, you're probably like, oh, even a glancing blow. Right. Hey, you probably like, what in the fuck me thinking about the way he knocked out Travis Brown when he knocked out Gonzaga and Derek would be even better if he didn't have a bad back. Derek's got a fucked up back. So why does he want it? That's three fights in six months. Or what was the last flight within Ghana? Um, well he fought in Ghana and that was the fight where it was just like, what the fuck? That was barely a fight. It was like five punches thrown the entire as a fan watching it. I felt like c one against in Ghana. Um, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:36:22       Yeah. But as a fan, I. Did you feel like that was more on in Ghana than it was on Derek? Yeah, I don't know. I always felt that way. Well, in Ghana who didn't do anything and Derek one, you know, he didn't win by much, but I mean he was basically waiting for in Ghana, you know, you gotta be careful with in Ghana because in Ghana punches so fucking hard but steep a fuck. That dude's head up. He really did steep ages. Fucked his head up. He, he. Yeah. That was even talking about in Ghana anymore. That's what's weird in Ghana. Before the steep a fight, everybody's like, this is the second common cited for that thing. Oh my God. When he knocked Alistair overeem into another dimension, everybody was like, Holy Shit. Yeah. That was, that was like, that looked like a career ending. Punch.

Speaker 2:          00:37:05       Her Dad was like a break your neck with this. Meanwhile overeem ready to fight again. Didn't he fight again after that? Against Curtis Blades. I feel like you did. I feel like he fought curtis please after that and lost and got stopped in that fight too. Yeah, I mean, look in Ghana hits Falk in hard, harder than anybody has ever fought. I mean, he's not. When he's mouth breathing in the fifth round, it didn't matter because he gassed himself out in the first and he really wasn't prepared for a full game. You really didn't think was going gonna go to the ground. From what I heard. Yeah. I thought I'd catch this guy. That's what I thought. He. He thought he hit so hard that steep. It was going to be in front of him. He's going to hit Steve Bay's going to be the heavyweight champ I was going to ask you.

Speaker 2:          00:37:44       Do you, do you have your absolute dream job? But I mean you do a few things, but like you, you get to talk UFC. You're a black belt under Eddie, right? Yeah. And so like you've kind of found the perfect job for yourself because you just can't tell when you're talking about. You just love it so much. Like I love surfing. I just, I live, eat and breathe surf everyday I wake up and the first thing I do is look at where's the waves in the world. Whereas when you retire, you'll do commentary. Uh, maybe a little bit. Yeah, maybe a little bit. But I don't want to, I don't really want a job whenever you die. You know, I've been, I've been, I've been on a pro tour pretty much since I was 19 and 46. I took about three years off, but I would still compete a little bit those years. What are the, what? It's the high end of the age limit in terms of like where does that can really compete? Like right now, no one's ever been my age on tour. Yeah, no, I think the

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       next oldest grand towards 38 and he's retiring this year. Wow. When I've gone on tour, the oldest guy was 28 years old. Holy Shit. It was like there was a real, you know, that I would say in the eighties there wasn't like, it didn't look like you could make some money and if you were a top five guy but it didn't look like you could have like this crazy career. So guys weren't thinking longevity. They're like let's go have a freaking good time. Travel around the world and get paid for it for a few years and then we'll figure out a job after or maybe we'll have enough money to kind of live real humbly. What is the difference between how you prepare and other guys? Is that your diet strength and conditioning? Like what is it? I don't overexert myself very much so my, my training aside from surfing isn't a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       I retain. I feel like I retain enough strength to be good at what I need to. So to find. Burn yourself out. I don't burn myself out, you know, cause like the oldest people in the world weren't athletes and they're kind of people who didn't burn themselves out too much. So I, my theory on longevity is like don't overdo it. I don't need to necessarily be overtrained for what I do. A lot of the skill. A lot of the, the winning that I do competitively is from a skill. It's not so much from being super strong having crazy cardio. It's making a choice about which wave, how I'm gonna approach and ride that wave. And I have to get two scores every 30 minutes when they compete. So it's like I got this 30 minute window I need to be ready for. I don't need to be like in crazy, crazy shape [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       So what is it that held other guys back in the past? I think there's a number of factors. I think you have to naturally be really competitive. Like in your, when you were born in your home, somehow you had to, maybe you needed something to prove. You know, I, I was Kinda like, you know, growing up I started of back at it and kind of laugh. Like I maybe I couldn't get the girl I liked because she liked an older guy or you know, I didn't have, we didn't really have any money in my family so I wanted to make some money. I had an older brother who kind of picked on me, but I hung out with him and played football with his friends that were all three years older than me. So I had to be strong, you know, I had to be tough and fast.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       I had to be smart. That's the case with a lot of guys, older brothers, you know, brothers that they couldn't really compete with them like this motherfucker. And so every night we would just eat away at the end. I think it, I think it did and there was always that, you know, my brother and I have, I think we have a pretty good relationship now and I don't think he would disagree with me that we kind of didn't get along for 20 years or more resort hate each other a long time. But you know, from the time we were teenagers we kind of grew apart, you know, I, I sorta started doing real well competing on the world stage and he sort of stagnated and we just, you know, people and families have different dynamics, you know, each child has a different dynamic, whether the first, I'm in the middle of three, all boys are younger.

Speaker 1:          00:41:24       Brother was three or six years younger than me, so he was kind of out of the loop when we were teenagers. He still a little kid so we, we're really competing with him. But he saw us competing against each other. And maybe a few ways and it kind of turned him off to surfing so he didn't start surfing until he was a teenager and when he did he wrote long boards and we're all, we're both short boarders like you know, more competition kind of guys. And He loved kind of the old throwback, the sixties and seventies surfers on long boards or on single fins, which is not a modern board at all. And why would someone choose one or the other? Longboards are short word. Yeah, it's a, it's a real different skill. Longboards are kind of easier to just get up and ride a wave.

Speaker 1:          00:42:08       But the skill you have on a long board is more. It's more ballet than it is a gym or something, you know, it's not like big maneuvers. It's more like gliding on the wave, looking like you're not trying hard. It's, it's more of a, a dance if you will. Then it is like a, some kind of an athletic skill and short boarding is just, you know, you're going for aerials and lots of different sort of fast maneuvers. Really riding in the pocket of the wave as long boarding, you're looking for a different kind of you. You write a different kind of way of altogether. You really don't. Most of the waves we ride for modern shortboarding and competition aren't waves. You would ride along board because they're too hollowed there too quick and fast and you can't fit a board in the same way. So your brother just kinda took it up more for the fun of it and the aesthetic of it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:56       He literally was at the beach one day, his story and he was about 14 or 15 and we always try to get them to surf and when he was about eight or 10, I took him surfing one day at our local, a break at Sebastian in Florida and I pushed him on this wave and he. He ate. It was underwater. Long time. It kind of freaked them out. Not a long time, a long time for an eight year old, like maybe 10 seconds or eight seconds. You know when you're out of breath, a little freaky like you don't know which way's up. And he kind of quit surfing and then when he was like 14 or 15 years at the beach and this guy, he, he really respected this kind of older guys. Like, Hey, I'm going to run somewhere. We watched my board, he had a longboard and he said, we watched my board.

Speaker 1:          00:43:33       And Steven said, oh yeah, watch it. And the guy said, or you can go use it if you want. And you paddle out and caught a few waves. And he just sort of fell in love with at minute with surfing. And it was something unique for him because we didn't long board. So it was like, it was that beach life and thing we love, but it was different, you know? Right. He got his own thing. Yeah. Yeah. And then me and my brother, we, you know, I got more and more into competition and getting sponsored and stuff and he sort of, he, he just kinda started fading out of doing competition fulltime and stuff. And, and, uh, and uh, then when I was a teenager, when I was in of a freshman in high school, this guy moved into town, a kid named drew and he had sort of got kicked out of a couple of schools elsewhere and I got himself into some trouble and when he came he came over to the beach.

Speaker 1:          00:44:22       He was kind of in these inland schools, but he was good at football and go to baseball. He was kind of a really good athlete. Uh, he became the quarterback on a football team. He was a baseball player, all this kind of stuff. So he was, he was a total jock, not a surfer at all. And somehow he and I became best buddies and you know, I liked, I liked all the sports. I grew up playing football, basketball, baseball, a little bit tennis. Um, and, and he and I ultimately where we got to is he sort of became my big brother competitively and we used to battle and it didn't matter whose feelings got hurt, you know, like we competed at absolutely everything from horseshoes to bowling to pull on my birthday. Every year on my birthday we made it a pack to where we'd go play every kind of game we could possibly.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       And we keep a tally of who won wide. It was many, it was Putt, Putt, golf, it was go carts, it was basketball, it was shuffleboard, it was like literally everything air, you know, everything we could think of. And uh, we just keep a tally and we, we used to be in the millions of dollars real well. Yeah, of course. So, you know, at some point somebody owed somebody a hundreds of millions of dollars, but you never paid no. Of course when it came down to like actual money, then it was like five bucks. And at one point he, he was uh, he got really into horse shoes and he called me out one day and he's like, meet me at the beach. We're gonna play some horseshoes. I'm like, all right, bye bye. I'm like, but I'm not playing you unless we're getting some money, some real money. And he's like, all right, bring some money.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       And at the end of the day, he ended up owing me about 160 bucks. He's like, you fucking tell my wife I owe you, I'll fucking kill you now. Never pay you because I don't have the money. I can't pay you that. And he was like, so I'll pay you like 20 bucks here and there as we go. But drew used to, he beat me at everything. He was better than me. Uh, basically everything. And so it was like that. A pingpong too on my 18th birthday that I like to call it the night upsets because it was a night that Mike Tyson last the buster douglas and it was, it was, uh, the night of February 10th. My birthday's in the limit on the 11th, but they were in Tokyo. So they were on the 11th fighting. Tyson last drew shows up in my house with the ping pong table and he says that it was like my birthday gifts. All my friends want me to ping pong table. My mom, my three buddies and drew beat me 17 straight games in a row. And I started crying.

Speaker 1:          00:46:48       I think he ended up letting me finally win the last game so we could go to bed at two in the morning and man, I've never been. I've really honestly never been so frustrated and just outright beaten by somebody at anything and he just owned. I just knew he owned me and he would just tell me where he's going to hit the ball on the table and beat me. Ping Pong is a serious skill. It's a really good at it. Oh, follow. You should go on Pol affinity on instagram and watch these things. These guys do. It's out of hand. I'm scared. Yeah. Ping Pong is one of those games where I was like, if I ever got into that, I think it would eat your life. It seems like we used to stay up the night and you know, we sucked and we thought we were pretty good. You know, we'd, we'd, uh, use soap and

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       water to make our or paddles a little stickier. You know, we thought we had all this pain and stuff. The guys are playing three way. That is crazy. I mean that's another kind of way you like it's a street and they're just smashing the ball and it, this is crazy and low behind the back. And is there money in Ping Pong? I don't, I, I think there are, you know, in China or something. Right? I don't think in the states there really is, but that's the same thing with pool now, but I don't know. I don't see some white guy going to China and beaten all those guys. You see these guys are masters. They don't move, you know, they just, they're the risk moves it, there's no dancing, you know? Yeah. It seems like one of those sports where there's just, there's a whole, there's a whole world out there that you're not aware of of like elite killer ping pong players.

Speaker 2:          00:48:22       Like most people aren't even thinking about it. Yeah, it's funny. We could talk about ping pong and it's like everyone can kind of join in. Like if I ever talk about fighting people are shut your ass man. You stay in your lane, but you know, it's just like, I'm a fan of pink pong too. I'll talk about ping pong. That's a funny thing that stay in your lane thing like, you know, have to have an opinion on things. Yeah. Yeah. So then why can we vote? You know, about somebody who's going to handle everything. Why are we allowed to. Can we only just vote be about something that has to do with surfing or fighting is a weird one. Like people want you have for, for some people, like you have to know how to fight to be able to talk about fighting. Yeah, they take it real serious about that.

Speaker 2:          00:49:01       Like you hear that about journalists, like look at this fucking guy. Probably never trained in Dana's life. You know, they look at a guy and he's fat or tiny or whatever and they just don't want to listen to anything that they say. But meanwhile they could be an expert. Yeah, I mean fight Roy Nelson. Yeah. Okay. Go, have fun. Have Fun with that one. But it's a, it's. I was a kid I trained with Don the Dragon Wilson. Oh, did you really? I did for about a year. I got a chance to spar him once. Did you. It was awesome. Yeah, it was. So to me it was like, I'm such a fan of that guy. He was totally ambidextrous Whitney. Oh yeah. He could fight any style and he, I mean he also had that weird, a sideways stance where, you know, he had like kickboxing skills, boxing skills, more skills, but he also had like a traditional karate and Kung Fu background.

Speaker 2:          00:49:44       So we'd stand sideways on you and you didn't know what was coming at you then, right? Yeah. Now he was awesome. And I remember when he fought Dennis Alexio, Dennis, Alexia, he moved to the west side of Oahu and that was like all the news back and then I, and he fucked Alexio up with leg kicks. He was like one of the first guys that punished Alexia with leg kicks. He did a thing on youtube about defense defense for self defense for women. And they were saying like, you're, it was part of this group. And the, they talked about like, you know, if you're gonna, teach a woman something, kick, kick the leg because that's the biggest target, you know, bad advice before Jujitsu. People kick the balls, but your legs carry you around. I mean, that's the thing about a woman. If a woman weighs 135 pounds,

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       she's walking around with 135 pounds carrying it. It's like, how, uh, how long could you walk on your hands? Yeah, I mean I heard that brock lesnar could walk into his hands like a mile, which is kind of crazy. Yeah. Really? He's a freak, like a legitimate free. He walks in his hands all around the gym. Yeah. He wanted to do a video, like walking up the stairs. I had a buddy, a surf buddy from. I'm from Santa Cruz. He unfortunately passed away gun. He and Barney a good friend of all of ours and he used to do these surf video clips and he would walk downstairs and then walk upstairs and he did all. He could literally just walk anywhere and his hand. It was so cool to see. Well, I mean, I guess you would build it. It's all about how often you use it, right?

Speaker 1:          00:51:08       You use your legs constantly. Don't use your arms constantly, but if you did and you built up over years of time, I would imagine. I mean there's obviously the shipping is quick to, you know, I mean I started doing hand actually right before I broke my foot. I started when I was a kid. I used to be able to pretty much walk in and listen on my hands. Like when you walk on your hands while your foot was broken? Uh, no, but that week I was like, you know what? When I was a kid I could walk for minutes at a time. My hands, I'm going to get back into that. So I started training that week. Like I just started doing handstands everyday with my friend's daughter. You broke your foot right? The week I broke my leg for the two weeks before I broke my foot and I started like quickly I could feel the skill coming back, you know, I mean I probably should have kept with it because then I could have walked around for a while and kept my foot high.

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       But uh, no, but I mean, my point is that like pretty quickly your body starts to attune to that thing. Like I used to do pushups on the back of my wrist, this buddy of mine who was into martial arts, he's like, do risk pushups. And what's the benefit of the. He was just saying to strengthen your risks. I don't know. He used to do it, but the first time I did it it really hurt my wrists. And then after about a week of doing it didn't hurt my wrists anymore. Your body just kind of adjust? Definitely. Yeah. But I dunno, I think I'm going to start doing handstands and doing that. The Burmese a volleyball thing. How long did it take? I mean, what were you on crutches or you want a wheelchair? Like how long did it take before you could actually walk a broken foot?

Speaker 1:          00:52:30       While I was walking a little too soon. Oh yeah. How long I didn't. I didn't break it, but I didn't displace the bones any. But I mean I actually wrote, I wrote a couple of ways, like six weeks later. No. Yeah, I probably would you do that? Well because we built this wave of like a up in your fresno. We built a manmade wave and um, are those a good way to learn? Yeah. Well, yeah, they can be. I mean it depends on how long the wave lasts and what size wave and how fast and all that kind of thing, but our way, it's pretty easy to learn on, but our wave lasts on the low speed for a beginner. It lasts over a minute long. That would seem to me that, that would be a great way to like just get your feet wet.

Speaker 1:          00:53:09       Yeah, no, you should come up. Is that it right there? Yeah, but that's not the low side at least what's like the, uh, as the high setting. Yeah. This was. And this was actually. Where is that like, is that a like 40 minutes south of Fresno area? Yeah, it's a big. It used to be a ski like, so it's long narrow lake. Oh Wow. That is crazy. Yeah, that's all manmade. This is manmade. That's so weird. This isn't the newest version of it. If you were to google, if you were to search, like, um, uh, there was a contest called, we had a couple of contests. We had one called the surf ranch pro about six weeks ago and that's, we changed the waves since then and uh, we remodeled that we had to rebuild it, but, um, anyways, the reason I surfed was because we were having the first competition at this wave and I wanted to ride the first way like, oh, I didn't want get to compete.

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       I just like, symbolically I wanted to ride the wave at the thing. So how does this work? What's making that wave? This is a coil, a wave foil, like a in the back it looks sometimes you'll see in the back behind the wave, not there, but to the left side more you would see this thing. It's a, it's basically a super inefficient boat hole and it pushes through the water. And so it's pushing water instead of planning on the water. Like you would want a boat too. So it's pushing all the water sideways and it's just this foil shape. It's almost like the shape of a finn or a wing straight up and down in the water is that blue thing in the back and it rides. It's like a rollercoaster and uh, it gets pulled on a pulley system with a 4,000 horsepower engine.

Speaker 1:          00:54:44       There's two of them actually wanted to go either direction. So you see it's now they've got their back to the wave when they're riding, but the first few ways they showed me this is Stephanie Gilmore. She's like six time world champ. Um, this is a, that's me obviously. And this was just about six weeks ago in September. And um, so yeah, I mean, I, I designed the technology with the scientist and then design the actual brief bottom or concrete bottom that, that makes the wave break. Yeah. Because this seems way more advanced than the ones that I've seen. Yeah. This is, it's a really advanced way. It's actually longer than it needs to be. Also [inaudible] at a fast speed. The waste to like 45 seconds and your legs are fried. This is Philippe Toledo, who's number two in the world right now. He's unbelievable. That's crazy fast.

Speaker 1:          00:55:30       Great Surfer. Where's he from? Brazil. A lot of surfers come from Brazil. All the new good guys are from Brazil. It's like the flight or fight game, you know, this is a Gabriel Medina guy's incredible. He's a, he's unbelievable. Whoa. And he's a fucking balanced. That's, that's probably shove it. Yeah. Um, and I think that was a corrupt flip. He did super high tech moves, but he. Gabriel Medina is one time world champ from few years ago, but I thought he was, you know, I thought he was just going to win year after year after year after his first title. I don't know if it got complacent or what happened and he and I aren't super just like, how do they judge like it's, it's a subjective. Yeah. Um, that's the probably the tough thing for our sport, but I mean gymnastics is subjective. Um, ice skating, you know, that kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:56:22       So it's not too different to me. It's not too dissimilar to that. So, you know, the judges are all good surfers, relatively good surfers. Maybe not exposed, but you know, guys who know what is possible. On a wave and I'm there, it's pretty easy for them to compare apples to oranges, a different person skills over the other one. Um, but it would be interesting in UFC, you know, if, if you had judges subjectively judging, not, not necessarily like who won the round or looking at counts, but like who styled it. I like how fast and how much power did he have, how did he link is, you know, strikes together. Just a subjective element to it. But unfortunately, unlike surfing the is not the judges, they're not, it's not comprised of former fighters were people that really know a lot of, which is wrong, totally wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:57:10       It's awful. I mean some, some surfers really believed that the judges should just be x pros that were tour level guys that make those calls. It seems like there's enough of those guys out there. There are, there may be, but you know, getting back to why that kind of leads me back to like you asked why guys didn't have the longevity that people get married, have kids and have a life back home. All of that kind of stuff. So, you know, I was sort of not quite the traditional route with all that stuff. Um, so I had a lot more time focused dedication into what I was doing and I wanted to do it for a long time because I just love surfing and I mean it. If I had my druthers every day I'm gonna wake up and go ride waves. Now is there a point system that this Koran Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:57:54       Out of 10 out of 10 boxing, not everybody gets a nine. If they lose that battle, you know, it's um, 10 is the Max tens Max, but I mean more average. You're seeing threes and fours than you are eights and nines because you know, it's just a certain wave in a certain skill set gets you up to that excellent category. So we consider eight and up. Excellent. And you know, sort of six, five to eight is like really good. And is there a lot of debate about whether or not I have a nine? Is, is, is accurate for someone's Rod? Yeah, yeah, there is. Well, if, if it's early, there's a lot to it, you know, like if it's early in a heat and a guy gets a nine or a girl gets a nine and then you think that there's a lot more that could have been done either on that day in those types of waves or on that wave specifically.

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       Like some occasionally you see somebody get 10 perfect. Why as good as you can possibly do. It's the ultimate, you should remember that way forever kind of thing. You know, it's like the perfect knockout but then won't, they'll kick off the wave when there's more to ride or they'll fall and they still get a 10. So like sometimes you'll see somebody get a really good score and you know, a lot more could have been done. They could've been deeper in that tube, they could have been higher in that area, they could have rotated it kind of, you know, more they could in the air, they could have written out like smoother. It could have linked a couple different, more difficult turns together, added more variety. So you have to kind of like if anything scaled down, I think as a judge as opposed to scale up because then you, if, if you're surfing in really great waves, which makes it easier to get a good score.

Speaker 1:          00:59:33       So like Tropo in Tahiti, if you, if you pull up Tahiti, I'm show poor t a h u t o m contest 2014. So we had really unbelievable waves in this contest. I'm almost every wave looked like it could be a 10. Then it comes down to like how late did you drop in? How critical was it? How deep were you, how did you maximize your time in there by slowing your speed, how much risk did you take? So even though they've only lasted about five seconds, there was a whole lot that can be condensed into that five seconds. And did you wait for one of the biggest waves or did you take a smaller wave and take and go, you know, a little bit easier? What is it like when one of those giant tubes crashes down on top of you? Um, yeah. So this game, Medina, he, he ended up winning the contest.

Speaker 1:          01:00:24       Um, it's not super fun when you eat. It could imagine that you've probably talked to Shane. That's me actually. Yeah, I've talked to Shannon about it. Yeah. And I mean, look, Shane, no one's more of an authority than Shane is. Maybe not in the super hollow, crazy stuff. Whatever. Shane writes everything. But the biggest waves in the world changes the authority. Like he's had wipe outs that he came close to dying. He probably talked to about their vest he created because of that, he almost drowned. He created a vest that you pull the co two cartridge and it bless, you know, this big bladder and lift you to the surface. Even if you get knocked out or taken water, someone's going to find you and probably save you. Um, but yeah, this is me there. So I didn't make that, but that wasn't even a big one.

Speaker 1:          01:01:08       You're not that for that day. That was a small way of fucking huge. The one that's coming down to see where I'm at. I'm kind of in blue water. Right. So I was able to dive and kind of get under it and not get sucked back over. So there's a little bit of a skill that goes with wiping out. So you understand that energy. It's, you know, it's like a, it's like a tornado or a hurricane. Like the eye wall is the worst. But your fear in the center, you're fine. You know, I always, I've always wondered like, could you follow a hurricane inside the center of the eye? Like could you just stay with it and be okay? I bet you could. If you moved to a really slow speed right there, don't move them. They only move about 10 to 20 miles an hour.

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       Sometimes less kind of playing go that slow. No, but maybe you could stay in the car, run, kind of like know, find a road. If you had a really good gps system, you've got to go, no, no, no, no. Go northwest, go northeast. Yeah, I'm okay. You're going to have to go off road or you'll die. But. So that energy, all that energy is in where the lip, where the, you know, if you're in the center that you're pretty safe. But as soon as you get sucked in right into the wall, that, and you get pitched in the limb, that's when the lips spreads the water that it hits and it sends you right down to the, especially in a place like this where it's, when you see a way that's real hollow, it's generally a lot shallower than it is high. So the wave will be 15 feet in the water, might only be five or six feet deep.

Speaker 1:          01:02:22       So think of all that energy it's going to hit. Most of it's going to hit the reef at some point. So that's a, you want to, you want to try to kind of fall like where that lives landing and then escape under it into blue water. What do you do? You know you're going to hit a reef, you kind of just breaks, you don't want to hit your head. Um, for the most part you can tell up and down. I mean, sometimes you lose your equilibrium a little bit underwater. But for the most part you can tell what is up and down so you can feel it coming. And I'm going to put my arms there before I take it on my head. And so I'm, I'm like trying to be like a cat, like when I hit, I want to be able to, I'll break my hands or feet or whatever, you know, I'm not worried about that.

Speaker 1:          01:03:00       I don't want to get knocked out. Right, right, right. So I think everyone, a default is to try to cover your head. Um, you know, if you hit anywhere else you're kind of okay. You just don't want to hit your head. And when the waves come crashing down on you, do you lose your sense of up and down? You can. Yeah. But you know, you, you also have your board connected from the leash and that's usually, that's generally going to pull up. So you kind of know, um, if you don't feel you're aboard pulling, you're kind of worried like, shit, my board might hit me, might spare me underwater. You know, you can occasionally get spirit in the face with your board or fin or something that's kind of spooky. Um, I was surfing with a guy who's like a big brother and I used to travel with Tom Carroll.

Speaker 1:          01:03:43       He's a two time world champion. We're surfing Tahiti one time together and he used to wear a helmet. A lot of guys, don't worry, most people don't wear a helmet, but tom used to wear a helmet. He was real really used to it. But having something, you know, an extra say inch around your head or half inch, it's like, it changes your judgment a little. So you got to be used to it. I always felt like it was weird. It's weird for aspiring to. It fucks with your peripheral vision. Yeah. Yeah. So it would mess with me when I tried to wear them and that extra weight and like when we're trying to, on a critical way of. We're trying to pull in the barrel, we're, we are dealing with inches, you know, percentage of inches. Like just tucking your head into that lip. And so you gotta you gotta kind of be really aware of your range and your, your ability to like Tuck your head at certain places and I was never comfortable with it but certainly with Tom and he wiped out and his board spirit him in the ear and it broke, it broke the helmet and broke his ear drum Jesus.

Speaker 1:          01:04:35       So we were just wondering like, what the hell would have happened if he didn't have his helmet on? You know, like probably would've killed him, you know, would it definitely knocked them out and we didn't have a jet ski with us that day or anything. We were, you know, 500 yards or more off the beach, half mile off the beach somewhere at this wreath. And blow your ear drum like that. Do you have to get it surgically repaired? Uh, no. I don't think so. I think I've never just let it heal up. I almost busted my eardrum like six weeks ago in Hawaii. Just free dive in. I felt it like, like a pinhole leak. I could feel it like going and I kind of got dizzy and I just came up and stop diving. But um, there was a guy, I'm like, I've got a buddy named Greg Long.

Speaker 1:          01:05:14       He's, he has drowned and he been attacked by a shark. Not Too many people can say those things and he's life. How do you get saved when he drowned? A, that's a really crazy story, but I'll just talk about one sec. But he did break his ear drum at mavericks up in northern California and he just, you just flounder. You don't know what you think. You're swimming one direction. You're, it's like you have, it's like your boats turn in and you don't know which there was no rudder, you know, and you don't know what's up and down and you know, you think you're something up and you're going sideways and it's really dangerous. There was a, there was guy in Hawaii a couple of years ago that drone surfing an outer reef. He and a friend of mine caught a wave and this guy wiped out.

Speaker 1:          01:05:56       He didn't have all he had with surf trunks and generally will wear like even a wetsuit, which is just then, but it keeps you warm and even that's enough flotation to where if you'd got knocked out, you'd probably come to the surface. So this guy wiped out his leash broke, so he lost his board and then we think, you know, the guys who are out there think that he popped his eardrum because they said they saw him hit the surface and start like his feet were coming up and his hand was coming up and you know, he was kind of just floundering around and then the next wave hit and they never saw him again, but he was only in surf trunks. So they didn't ever find the body. Um, because he didn't float up. But if he just had it, even just a wet suit, just some neoprene ever found the bomb, didn't find him.

Speaker 1:          01:06:36       The waves were huge. It was, you know, it was like 40, 50 foot, whatever. But it was really unfortunate. It was a real. Those things are really like sobering in the surf community because we all know each other and um, and you know, ultimately you're doing this for fun and you know, it's, it's a, it's a heavy thing, but it's crazy that your eardrum affects you that much. Yeah, I mean I've seen, I've seen people that have inner ear infections and they'll get dizzy walking. I just don't know what they're doing while they're one front in front of the other, they want to fall sideways. It's very strange. Yeah. Well, so greg, Greg Long, he drowned actually at a place called Cortez Bank, which is about 120 miles off the coast of Dana Point. It's just a re. It's basically that the top of a mountain on an island that never hit the surface.

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       And it was discovered when, I think it was a nuclear ship actually grounded itself on that reef back, I don't know, 30 years ago or something and caused a lot of, caused tens of millions of dollars of damage to the ship navy ship. Um, and yeah, I don't know if they had sounded the bottom by then. It must not have known it was there, but um, anyways, this wave breaks when it's really big and I'm, Shane's been out there. Shane was actually, I think Shane was out there this day, not positive, but I'm pretty sure Shane was out during this session. There's about 15 guys out, doesn't guys out and Greg took off on a wave and a, somebody who in front of him on the wave, which kind of changed his angle a little bit, but he, I don't think he would've made the wave anyhow, but it just puts them in a little bit of a precarious situation.

Speaker 1:          01:08:12       Um, and he ate it. It was down a long time. This wave has just so much energy in it because there's nothing between where the wave started and this break, like it's thousands and thousands of feet deep that, you know, over the whole Pacific. So there's no continental shelf to slow the wave down. Know if you can imagine the east coast. We have small waves. A big part of that, part of that is because most of the storms go west to east and they don't come towards us. But even on a hurricane are our surf, not that big because we have a continental shelf that goes, you can go out, you can go out 20 miles and it's 70 feet deep someplaces. So the swells just drag in the Pacific. They don't drag, there's just nothing to get in the way. So these wells are going 35 miles an hour when they hit.

Speaker 1:          01:08:56       So it's a lot faster than a normal wave. So there's all this energy and the wave. And so when Greg went down and this wave is probably a 40 foot face or whatever, 50 face, he was underwater and he's really calling. He's, you know, he's probably as, as ready for anybody in big surf. He's totally prepared. He's done all the CPR and breathing courses and everything and he was real calm and he said he pulled his vest and it didn't work. And then he pulled another one and it didn't work and he pulled it a third time and it didn't work. And so he's like, Oh fuck, I'm screwed. You know, that kind of thing. But he, at that point, you're, when you start to pull it, you, you're already in a little bit of a, some, some guys pull it right away just to be safe when a big wave.

Speaker 1:          01:09:37       But some guys kind of wait and go, I'll see if I'm able to pull this one off and I'll save my little canister because you only have like some of the vets have to earth two canisters, some have four. So you don't want to have to change your canisters over. So if you're thinking going to make that, you're going to get back to the surface. Are you okay? You can handle it and you got a good breath. You're like, I'll just, I won't pull it. But he pulled three times and then he blacked out and they, luckily it had really good water safety crew and um, I don't know that it was his brother that saved them. But a couple of the guys went and grabbed dove in and pull them up by the leash. Luckily he was to the least because he wasn't floating because he didn't have the CEO too.

Speaker 1:          01:10:15       And then he had taken a lot of water and uh, they had to airlift him off the boat in height and big seas that night after dark and got him back to the mainland. So did they do cpr on him? They did CPR. Yeah. And then the come back to consciousness came back to consciousness, but he was like awake when the airlift and nobody gets fucked up. Yeah. But guys can have secondary drowning. Um, we still have water in the lungs and you're not aware of the symptoms or whatever. Get it out. Um, I don't know. They pump it off it out. They can't just hang by your ankles or anything. Yeah, I think they pump it out. I was with a buddy in Australia a year and a half ago and then he almost drowned, got knocked out his board, hit him in the chin, knocked him out cold.

Speaker 1:          01:10:57       And uh, I was, I was sitting out the back waiting for a wave and I heard everyone kind of, I heard another friend screaming. Luckily the waves kind of stopped and they were able to get to them, pull them up on a jet ski and he had taken it in some water and he's puking and coffin and all this stuff and I came up from behind and I didn't see his neck. Um, and I heard, I heard one of the guys say, Oh, he got his board, hit him in the neck and the throat, and so I was expecting this artery be cut or like the throat to be open. Like I was like, okay, I don't want to look yet, you know, because I was behind him. I didn't want to get it to go around him and try to look. I'm like, okay, let's get him into the beach.

Speaker 1:          01:11:36       Luckily we had a jet ski because we were about a mile off shore. And um, I just, I held on the jet ski and kind of, I just squeezed on behalf on the. We have a sled on the back of the jet ski, like a body big giant bodyboard with handles. So I just kind of straddled him. My other friend rode the ski all the way up on the beach and then I thought, okay, when we get the beach I'm going to have to see, this is going to be gory. But luckily he wasn't opened up. He just had a huge hematoma here on his neck and he, it didn't slice him. It just like contusion, like blunt force. That's very lucky. Yeah. But he spent two or three days in the hospital because they were worried about secondary drowning, which I don't exactly know what secondary drowning means, but I guess when you have water, salt, water in your lungs, it can.

Speaker 1:          01:12:16       I don't know, maybe from the way you laid down or I don't know, I should probably be super school mistakes you're living. Right? But uh, yeah, you must see a lot of crazy shit in the water. Like I'm seeing some crazy stuff. Yeah. Wildlife. And I mean, you must see an amazing amount of fish and the shark copics super. It never ends, you know, like, I mean anyone in the world I meet is like, Oh, I'm scared of sharks. Told me about that story. Doesn't ever end that story like it's a primal fear, like getting eaten by a monster, you know, you feel so vulnerable in the water. I mean maybe you feel less vulnerable because you're bored and you have a board knew so quick with the board, but like someone like, oh, you, you are totally vulnerable if a great white one too. Oh yeah, completely. If you're, if a shark over, I mean, even if a six foot shark wants you, but that's the, that's the misconception. You know, everyone thinks, oh, shark death, you know, jaws just fucked everybody up. So I was seven or something when, when I was six, I think when jaws came out and I watched it, you know, I watched brick poltergeist when I was 10. My parents let me watch everything and mine to.

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       Maybe that's why I always thought there was some boogeyman in the closet, you know, or whatever. But yeah, it keeps your prepared. Maybe that's why I started training with a dragon, you know? But uh, um, so jaws, I wouldn't even go in the deep end of a pool. I was so freaked out that I was like, there's going to be a shark at the deep end somewhere and you know, I would only stay in the shallow end for a couple of years when I was like five or six, you know. But uh, yeah. So anyway, so greg got to the hospital. He was all right. Um, what about a year and a half ago, a friend of ours who's a great big wave, got like, this guy is completely, totally fearless. He drowned in Fiji and Greg, who had, who I talked about it, Cortez Greg actually did CPR and brought him back.

Speaker 1:          01:14:18       Wow. And um, they're, they're, you know, the, the big wave guys are a tight. It's a tight bond of camaraderie with these guys because I mean, yeah, everyone wants that big wave. They want that biggest way. They want something they have never had, but they want their, they're all really close friends. Like they're, they know that there's life and death having each other's backs and pretty much everyone knows cpr. Most. Yeah. Most everybody that. There's courses that the big wave guys run every year. They put these courses together a couple times a year, um, specifically to train for the situations that we could be in and um, yeah, so it's really, really great because they bring in a lot of, you know, breath hold deep freediving people and the best cpr and lifeguard guys in the world, a lot of the best life guard guys in the world are already surfers.

Speaker 1:          01:15:02       Anyway, on the north shore of Awahoo. I'm in Maui and uh, I mean those are the guys you want to have your back when there's in the surf zone. Some guy in the coast guard's probably not gonna be able to do the same. Like they might help your boat, but they're not. And I'm not trying to put coast guard guys down at all in any way. I'm just saying like these guys trained specifically for in the Whitewater, in big surf, you know, they train the seal team, six guys in Hawaii every year, so it for heavy situations. So how often do you actually see shorts? Depends where you're at. In Florida, I see sharks almost daily. Real. Yeah. I live in Florida. I'm from Florida. I still go back there and most days you surf, you'll see in certain places you'll see a lot of why I live here.

Speaker 1:          01:15:49       I live in Hawaii, I live on Australia. Oh Damn. You're. I'm a nomad. I'm not going to modern nomad, you know, but I'm cheap apartments in different places. So when I, when I first started making money, I thought that would be cool to have a little place in each place I go that I kind of based out of so I can be feeling like home on the roads. That's another thing is like I've always, I've, I wanted to make the world like my home when I was a kid. I just love traveling. I love meeting people everywhere. I love having these sort of household feeling, uh, you know, families everywhere and stuff. So in Australia I bought a place in Sydney when I was 20. I'm with a friend, you know, I just bought this real humble two bedroom, tiny little two bedroom on the beach, like just back from the beach.

Speaker 1:          01:16:34       My old roommate and I talk about it now, we're like, why don't we buy that whole freaking apartment block, you know, because it was cheap back then. It was like 150 bucks, 150,000 bucks per apartment Australia, which was like $100,000 us at the time. So I bought I own half of that for about 15 years and then I sold that and I bought another place up near. I'm on the Gold Coast in Australia. Australia has a lot of dangerous shit, right? Because they have every dangerous shit box. Jelly fish. Yeah. They box jelly fish, salt, water crocs. Lots of great whites while you're surfing. No, I. Well I have. Yeah, I have Costa Rica Do. That's scary. That's those things. People talk about sharks. Sharks don't hunt you. They might bite you if they see you, you know, like, but uh, uh, a saltwater croc. That thing is watching you.

Speaker 1:          01:17:22       It can feel you walking in. It knows from that vibration how close you are to the water's edge. It knows exactly. I can pinpoint it. Can pinpoint to the waters edge where you're at. Yeah. That noise, my friend Adam Green tree lives in Australia and he's not all over Australia. They're everywhere. No, no. Do Your House. No, no. They're waiting for you at the supermarket. But they do keep track. Like I know that the closest one to the Gold Coast where I'm from is like, it's still like 300 miles north or something like 200, whatever. It's like the closest saltwater crocs. Yeah. They keep a track, like, you know, they're pretty visual and about how, where they are, what rivers they would be. Because I got to warn people like, don't swim here. Some people don't listen, they're stupid and they die. But like a crock snuck on to just sort of give you an exploratory bite like a great white might in review.

Speaker 1:          01:18:09       They're going to snatch you and there, you know, and they're not going to get the surfboard in the way from the underbite, you know, they're gonna. There was a horrible story that I read it. I think it was a national geographic about this. These two people that were kayaking in the river in Africa and this guy was the guy went with them. Did you? This might be a different story. I don't know what story did you hear? This one was like, these two guys were going to do a first descent down this thing and they were contacting another guy who had done that river, an American guy, and the American guy was like, I can't miss this descent. I got to do this. I got to do that whole river. And then the three of them got into the zone where they're just everywhere in the river was real slow and wide and as soon as they got there, all the river, all the crux came off the river bank and they were like, oh shit.

Speaker 1:          01:18:52       There's like tons of them. And this guy's theory was to take his helmet and throw it off to the side so it would be like movement and distract them. And they'd attack that and he paddled to shore and all three of them got together and the American guy was on the right side and the other two guys were together and they were so close. They see like the guy in the middle like couldn't really paddle. He would just kinda like, you know, trying to move along with them. And so they figured if the bigger we are, the bigger we look and more intimidating, like maybe it will be okay. Fifteen, 18 foot crop comes up, grabs the guy, takes him out of his, pulls them out, as Kayak disappears, they never see him again. His backpack floats up. And then this stuff's floating down downstream.

Speaker 1:          01:19:28       The other two guys get out of the water. And um, I think I'm telling the story pretty good because I read it like five times online too. And they got other water and then there was a little village just down and there was a little bridge over and they had, there were some boats when the boats were all dry docked and they went down and in broken English it was one person that could talk to him or whatever. And they said, we know our boats are not in the water because there's too many crocs here. Like we know not to go in the water because they were like, we need a boat. We got to find his body, we got to try and save him, you know? And then they went to the bridge and watch this stuff like float by. That's the same story. It's. And the guy wasn't supposed to be on the trip and there was about the, the, the Kayak flipping and then pulling

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       his body out under the Kayak. Yeah. Brutal. They're monsters. It's a, there's a show called. They really are. There's a show called uncharted by what you've seen that show. My friend Jim shockey is Florida. Yeah. That's 15 foot fucking alligator they found in Florida was strolling across the golf course. And the next day they found a giant snake, a giant rattlesnake strolling across a golf course. Look at the size of that thing I fed, you know, I was friends with Steve Irwin. So you said go to look at the size of that thing on a golf course. Here's the thing. I, I, I, I think there's a misconstrued misconception about the crocs. And they actually talked about this because I used to be friends with Steve Irwin before he passed away. He took, he actually had me hand feet, a 13 foot crock, scary, scariest thing I've ever done in my life.

Speaker 2:          01:20:59       Terrified he would you do that? I don't know. He, he told me, you know, you got to feed a crock because like, Kelly, you're ready. You got a fee. Crock got to Viagra. So for two nights so crazy for two nights I had nightmares. Look at it. What is this guy doing? I told you I saw this a few weeks ago. This guy doing. He's feeding them by hand of these things. Look at their heads, kid. Good Lord. And these are wild crocs. Well, they look like they know this guy is going to feed him something. They know something like that. Bad Man. Look at the heads on these things, but see, this is like the conception we. The concept we have about these animals, right? We just think that they're just killers and whatever. Do you ever see the guy and limone Costa Rica who had a pet?

Speaker 2:          01:21:48       15 foot crock? Yeah, they did say that guy's an asshole. This is crazy. It's a crazy animal man. It's a crock. Freaked me out. But I like, I kind of miss when I'm playing. When I'm playing golf. I played a lot of golf when I'm in Florida. I always messed with the gators. Like I'll grab him by the tail. Yeah. Why? It's kind of. I don't know. It's just like, it's fun until you get your arm bit off I guess, but this guy's not even. He doesn't even need to backstep, you know? He's like, well those are smaller. Yeah, but that means that going to rip your arm off death roles, but that's so small in comparison to those other ones. I was fishing in Australia in this fresh water, a river, but it goes down to the ocean. So salt water crocs come up to a certain point.

Speaker 2:          01:22:34       There's like this dam and they don't go past that. So you know, down here, up here, appears all the fresh water down here is fresh and salt water. And we saw a few 15 foot crocs this day and we're in a boat there was six feet wide and 18 feet long, 15, 18 feet long. And um, you know, the guy taking us, he said, you know, we don't have problem in this boat, but you know, if you fill out the boat, there was a problem. But he was telling us a story. One day I was fishing with these guys, this one guy standing up in the boat fishing. He falls out of it and the guy was about 250 pounds or something, like

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       a big dude, like maybe 300 pounds. He was like a big overweight guy and he fell the boat and the guy said the guy was in the water for about two minutes and he was just like, any second, this guy is dead. He's like, there's nothing I can do. And he said it was all they could do to hit dead to get him from the front of the boat. He was trying to pull up up the side and he couldn't and he was panicking. So He's, you know, when people go into panic mode, like when people are drowning and they're panicking and they say you got to punch them in the face and try to knock them out and calm down and they couldn't punch this guy like they were. They were trying to get them to calm down and then to get them all the way to the back of the boat because they had to get him up the transom and they said from there they could get leverage and lifting and it wouldn't flip the boat or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:23:44       But he said this guy was in the water for a couple minutes and he's like, at any time there is a crock that's big enough to eat you within sight of us here at all times. But this guy said that he said that I'm the biggest, you know, I said what's the biggest one you ever seen? Because we've seen 15 foot crocs like every 20 minutes, every half an hour. 15 foot. Yeah. No Julian fricking. Yeah. And we're, we're fishing. Oh my God. I'm, we're fishing for bear Monday. That's a crazy fish. Yeah. And um, and uh, so we're fishing for money and I keep thinking like, I don't know when you got one in the line is like a shark bite, that thing or whatever. And anyways, we start asking the guy, what's the biggest one you ever saw? And he said, mate, the biggest one I ever saw was about 28 feet.

Speaker 1:          01:24:26       20. Yeah. Twenty nine feet maybe. And he said he's only seen it once. And he sought from about a kilometer away and the estimate of the size. And he said, this guy, these guys in a helicopter salt at once and it doesn't stay in the river, it stays out in the ocean. And he said, it's so smart, it knows it's in silty water where nothing can see it. There's nothing as big as it. It owns its territory, you know, one the eight feet. Yeah. And he said that he said that the back, we're in the six foot boat. And he said, if this thing, he goes, I tell you this, how big they are. He goes, this one would be, he said if it was under our boat, it would be sticking out about four to six feet on either side across his back, sideways.

Speaker 1:          01:25:04       And we're in a six foot wide boat. So he said it'd be like 15 foot across the back. It's back, like that's how fucked up. So think of the girth. So something that big 15 feet across the back. Yeah, that's what this guy told me. I don't know, we didn't see it. Oh my God. I mean we're seeing, you know, 15 footers that are like, it's girth close to that, you know, like a great white. When you see a 15 foot great white, it's girth is 15 feet pretty much. They're so fat. Yeah. Once they get like 10 feet, then they start getting fat and the growth gets about the length them. So if you see a 15 or 20 foot 18 foot great white and you measure their girth, it's pretty much their length. How big the crocs get. I don't know. This guy said, I don't know, this guy's claiming it's like mostly the biggest crock in the world, but there was one they called gus or something in Africa. I used to go late night just youtube this stuff when they were saying this is the one that had eaten, like they think it's eaten over 100 or 200 people in these villages and they think it's like 23 feet long or something. Well this Jim shockey show that I was talking to you about uncharted Gustavo's. Turn him loose. Look at that fucking thing.

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       The Savannah King. Is that a perspective shot though? Look how far back those of you wonder. You wonder. Yeah, but people do that with pigs and they make them. I do that with my 28 when I catch a fish, put it right where it says 28 feet, four inches. So that makes sense. Like what's that? That's a replica of how big it was. Fuck that thing. Fuck that thing in. Everything that was alive before that made this worse to, you know, go back to that picture jamie. That replica, make that larger the replica and just make that larger. Look at the size of that fucking thing. Oh well what is the largest confirmed ones? Because if that one is 28 feet, four inches. The thing about that, when they said 28 feet, four inches, that's like back when people were full of Shit. Yeah. I mean this guy who told me this guy might've been trying to freak me out too.

Speaker 2:          01:26:54       I mean because that thing is 20 feet and it's not 20 feet across his back or 12 feet, you know? Yeah. But another eight foot long, it's pretty. It's a lot bigger. And why you see when you see like a five foot crop or alligator and then you see a 10 foot the girth relative to the length changes at that point is. It's like a. What he's talking about the ratio in the size. It's at one point. What does it say? Number one. What the say? Number one candidate. This was a list of the top 10. So I think their largest crunch. Cambodia crocodiles, seven me. Now, is this just the species they're talking about? Yeah. This is just the five largest crocodiles ever recorded. Oh, okay. Cambodia show the picture of the Cambodia 1:23 feet. That doesn't have a pen. Oh, it doesn't. So there's only one that had a picture.

Speaker 2:          01:27:37       Did you not take a picture of a 23 foot long crocodile? Trust me, bro. Shit was big. Yeah, I mean I would imagine that there's probably bigger ones out there. I know there was a super killer croc that went extinct that far. Dwarfed those. Those were 60 feet are enormously extinct. Pull up that extinct. Giant crocodile. I had a friend who was a commercial fisherman in South Africa and he was like, he told me, he's like the biggest check, so way bigger than you think. He's like, I want to see a picture or something. He said, I'll tell you this. I was on a 60 foot boat with 10 guys fishing almost a. He said like everybody in the boat saw the shark he had at camp next to their boat. There were 20 miles off of Port Elizabeth where there's this reef, they fish and he's claiming the thing was more than half the length of their 60 foot boat.

Speaker 2:          01:28:26       Yeah. He's like, it was 35 feet. That's what he tells me. What is the biggest great white like 20, but he's saying there's big jock who's stoke supposedly filled one and Cape Verde that they didn't have anything. They couldn't tell the size because they didn't have something next to it. He said it was close to 10 meters, which is 30 feet, but this guy's. This guy's telling me, he goes, no. He goes, I've seen this shark twice out there is what he told me, but I dunno. They're out there every day. That's the thing. How many people are out there? You know? I don't know know. It's like people are the biggest ones. The biggest ones are smart, you know? Yeah. Like I don't, I rarely see a big shark. Rarely I'll see. Like I've seen a couple of great whites in South Africa jump look at that thing, that, that is the replica of something that used to exist.

Speaker 2:          01:29:09       12 animals. You're glad his fucking skull. This guy's basically standing inside the skull. This crocodile. So freaky. Fuck that man. Well that's that. That's the premise of that stupid movie. The Meg, meg, Meg, A. I won't even watch it like that. Do you remember that movie? That deep blue. Is that what it's called? There was a shark that they were, there were sharks. They were training. They were like Gmo sharks are. So these genetically cloned sharks and they were supposedly training them and then they got too smart and they started eating everyone and then there's like, you know the girl in the Bikini and she has to take off her wetsuit because it's rubber. I don't know. There's, you see these movies and you just like the artistic license on these things are so bizarre. There's no truth to it. It's like Samuel Jackson was in a rico and he starts talking about. He goes, you know what, you know what? Dangerous waters, not dangerous use as dangerous.

Speaker 3:          01:30:08       We're going to pull together and we're gonna find a way to get out.

Speaker 2:          01:30:19       Good moving. See that? I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't see that coming at all. I wouldn't go in the water for seconds after that. So that movie, you know, I actually was with Samuel l Jackson like three weeks ago in Paris. Golf together. How big I wanted to ask him about that, but I didn't. I didn't know the balls. I mean, how big do you think they could be? And people don't know. I mean 30 feet sounds reasonable. If they think they're 25 feet, there could be one that's 30 feet maybe. Yeah. I mean I think it's reasonable to go and. But that's a lot more years and eating and like no one saw it during that time. I mean it's Kinda like Ufo is I got to see one. Yeah. I got to see an alien sharks and we know they get big and we're not just how many people are out there looking for them?

Speaker 2:          01:31:05       That's the thing. But they filmed one they call big blue last year I think in Guadalupe Island. I think it was. And it was 22 feet. Yeah, the videos online and it's, you know, a big day look, right? Yeah. This thing's face and nose looks small because the body is so huge. It must've been a pregnant female or something, but it's body looks like even bigger around in the length. And they said it was 20. She like it's face almost looks like small to fuck. Oh my God. See the girth girth is so foiled. Smartest Shark. Seven meters. So that's 20, 22 feet, 23 feet. What the, this guy touches it. Comes out of the cage and touch it. Look at the size of this thing. That's another thing. That's the shark feeding freaks me out. There's this guy touched it, watch. He just comes out and he's like, I gotta touch this creature and I got to get out of there bitch, but she like his face almost like small compared to how a massive so scary that is so big.

Speaker 2:          01:32:07       It looks like a whale. It literally looks like a whale. Oh my God. And to think that there's something out there that's 10 feet bigger than that. Well, a killer whale can eat that things liver without thinking about it in half. And killer whales, just a dolphin. It's so weird to think that that thing has dominance over that thing. It is, but there's just so much smarter. It's not even close. There's so much more agile, so much smarter. For how often. What? This is a seven year old, what do they call that? Oh, Greenland. Shark. Yeah. They think isn't. Wasn't that one of the speculations of what the Loch ness monster was? I think it was some sort of a landlocked green or not. Landlord wouldn't have been in the lock. Now the thing was the lock because it was trapped because the law is used to be connected to. That was a twig that was terrific. Woodman, or it could be like a sturgeon or some shit like that. Like there was one of. One of those was a lake champlain or one of those surgeons are huge. Sturgeons are crazy. That's another dynamic alligator. Gar. You seen those things? My friends went fishing for them. Yeah. They haven't made Texas. You can catch them in Texas. Those things are bizarre. I don't think you're noodling for those things.

Speaker 2:          01:33:20       That's another thing. It's hundreds of millions of years old, right? I mean that would be. I'd love to go take my friends and just go. Newland sometimes sounds kind of creepy or girlfriend. Be like, what noodling. Oh, for catfish, you get accidentally get turtle. Sometimes they're snapping turtles and bite your arm off is Gary's. I feel fucking. We just break your arm in half. Probably. Fuck you up. I mean, I'm sure dudes are probably lost fingers. Snapping Turtle. Those. What's that? Yeah. Actually I googled that and the snapping turtle incidents popped up. Guys losing their hands. Don't show me this because that's like razors. They're like two razors that go garden sheers. Taking your fucking arm off. Oh, what? How often have you encountered workers? I've never seen an Orca. Really? No, not. No. I mean not other than two worlds. Kidnapping of them. Foxy world. Yeah. I'm with Ya.

Speaker 2:          01:34:14       I just don't understand. I mean, I guess I understand because I was a kid once and I went there, but I don't understand how a rational, logical thinking adult could take their kids to see world after all the information that's out there about, about the social behaviors, about how smart these animals are about how gotten to a lot of people. Unfortunately, I agree with you if you did get the information, but a lot of people just don't know. They think, well they're. They're fed. They're healthy. Yeah. They don't. Yeah. I got in this battle with and look, I'm no scientist. I debate people all the time, but I'm no scientist obviously. I just, I think I have a pretty good heart and I feel bad for animals that are up, that need to travel a hundred miles a day in their social pacts and they need to have interaction with other animals and they need a certain amount of space.

Speaker 2:          01:35:04       I mean, imagine you think about solitary confinement for a prison, a prisoner who's, who's in, who's in a room that's no wider than they are tall and maybe twice as twice as long as they are tall, you know, and, and there's no interaction with other people. They go crazy. Most people will come out of prisons and jails worse than they went in because of this kind of thing that happens to them. But I think of being in there for 30 years, just wondering, God, there's another whale and the other side of that wall. Can I get some fish? And I mean, you go nuts and you see these videos of that, the trainer that was killed, um, and a trainer, one trainer, luckily the guy was a great free diver and he lived through a, basically an attack by an Orca. And the thing he knew, he wanted to get over to that wall and he went, Nope, I'm not gonna play with you and I'm just going to keep pulling you down and pulling you down.

Speaker 2:          01:35:54       And the guy was good enough freedom to be able to know, okay, I've got to conserve my energy. I gotta bring my heart rate down. I'm going to have to hold my breath against my will when I don't know what's going to happen. A friend of mine used to work at marine land in Canada. My friend would fill, filled demars and he was an Orca trainer and you know, and he's trying to get marine land closed down. There was this big lawsuit with them and he's been involved in a lawsuit with them for over five years now. I was just hanging out with him in Toronto and he was a Walrus trainer and this is Walrus that he was taken care of. It's the only one that's left there that survived. And marine land is like slowly going bankrupt. The guy who was the original owner is now quickly go bankrupt.

Speaker 2:          01:36:36       That's why it's so dark, man. The whole, the whole business is so dark because, you know, a lot of them say, oh, we won't take any, you know, orcas are dolphins from captivity, but they'll get them from people that stole them in the wild and they, they, uh, breed, you know, I think there's no more breeding a lot in America. Yeah. But they'll get them from someone that bred them in Canada or Russia or China or wherever, someplace where there's not as many rules. You know, John Lilly, who was the guy who actually invented the isolation tank, is a, he was a pioneer in interspecies communication, which is a, it's a weird field. He was a scientist. That was also. He took like extreme liberties with his scientific research, took a lot of acid, gave asset to dolphins, did a lot of dolphin research in the flotation tank, did a lot of really, really wacky shit.

Speaker 2:          01:37:26       But he believed that one day dolphins, we're gonna have a seat in the United Nations. He believes we're going to be able to communicate with dolphins and that dolphins were going to be recognized as water people. He thought they were going to be literally the thought there was smartest human beings. Amazing. If we could figure out how to communicate with them, they would have the same rights as human beings. Yeah. And Guy was a genius. I mean, just he and I, I agree with them. I think there's just a level of communication. There's a way that they have of communicating that we don't understand, but it's super complex, very of their own dialects. They, they, they have this crazy social code that mean they, they have something like incredibly dynamic about their environment and their, their, their, their, you know, their social groups. To be, uh, to be able to speak a language you need to know, like 150 words.

Speaker 2:          01:38:19       There was a dolphin that new like 700 words, 300 words, I don't know, like 100 commands. Standard human words. You know how many dolphin words we know? Zero. A fucking clue. We have no idea. We don't know what the fuck they're saying, but they're so goddamn stupid. Fucking stop giving me macro level. They're like, they don't know, were making fun of them for 100 years. I don't think they know what to do with them. Well, one of the things that Phil was working with was there's a group, what was that group that where they're trying to, they're going to create a boundary out in the ocean and slowly released these dolphins and orcas out into this boundary and then you know, and keep feeding them, but then slowly released them out open ocean pens. Yeah. They're talking about doing that possibly, and that would be a way for people to actually experience it because the idea is that you and I, I had a debate with his trainer.

Speaker 2:          01:39:13       I watched blackfish and it just freaked me out and of course it's. There's probably a lot of confirmation bias. There's probably some information in there that is not totally unbiased. Right. Obviously they're trying to make a point, but this woman was. She talked to all the different trainers and stuff. I got in contact, a guy got in contact with me that was a trainer and he said, Kelly, the whole movie is Bs. I think. I believe this guy was actually in the movie. He's like, it was all bs. Orcas live longer in, in captivity in indeed they do. In the wild. He told me that orcas haven't been in captivity as long as they live yet, so we don't know that. So that's completely a lie. It's. He has no idea if that's true. He said they're more healthy. He told me all these things and I just finally went, this guy's just full of shit.

Speaker 2:          01:40:00       I Dunno, I, I can't buy what he's telling me. And He. But he said I'm a trainer. I've been a trainer for it. I looked him up and biased because that's what makes his living exactly. And I know some dolphin trainers and I actually went to seaworld a few times in Australia. I used to know a few of the trainers back in the late nineties and I went there a few times when I'm with the dolphins. The first day I was there, one of the things I asked him was like, do they? Well these guys ever get set free and right. Then I could feel a little pull back. You know, like straight away I could feel like maybe, and I released my slaves. Yeah, I felt a little uncomfortable with keep asking questions because it is their livelihood and I had a respect for that and I know that all these trainers love these animals. They really, truly, probably loved them more than most people. Um, but that doesn't make it right at all. Um, and there are probably some animals that can handle being in a zoo or they're happy. They're giraffes, giraffes, and a bit about that, that just walking around going on was no lions,

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       Kangaroos, you know, they get fed well, they don't really need to migrate Predator that's going after them. There's, I mean they let babies feed giraffes at the zoo. Yeah. Because there's so calm. My friend has a draft in Malibu. Really? Your friend as a giraffe has a draft. How ballers your friends fucking awesome. And bitches come over your house. You got to right? They bought it for like 30 grand or 20 grand. Yeah, his Ferrari got a bunch of that. That's my giraffe. They got some emus and the mind inside our chef will be cooking for you or we'll fly to Jamaica. My private jet motherfuckers got a giraffe can be poor and they got a winery. They got a giraffe. They got. He's got his own winery. Yeah. Their family has like all this acres, but anyways, this draft, super cool. He come up and eat at her house in Malibu, Malibu Hill.

Speaker 1:          01:41:38       It's called Malibu wine wine or Malibu winery or something. Man. Wake up with a mountain lion eating lunch around. I know they got to watch out. There's a mountain lion that killed 11 alpacas up there. My friend lives in Topanga Canyon and he, he, uh, he came home one day or one night a mountain lion got into his pig pen or pen or something Kinda ugly. There's a lot of them were talking about that anymore and it had to figure out like he had this, the way he had his thing, it couldn't climb up the fencing or break under it. It had tried apparently the thing new to climb up this tree and drop from like 12 feet or 15 feet down into the pin. What's. Yeah, yeah. It had to climb this tree he had. He has cameras and stuff. He figured it out. Figured it out.

Speaker 1:          01:42:26       Yeah. Fuck those things man. You know, I went to muscle bay and in South Africa, so I was interested to do one of those shark dive feeding tours. I thought I'll go check it out. Got there, get on the boat and you go out and you don't want to. I didn't want to bring my own wetsuit because I didn't want all this fish slime all over it. You know what I mean? So like I don't want to go back to surfing the next day at some back of Jeffery's bay. Smelled like fish. Yeah. And uh, so um, get on the boat, go out there and where they feed them, there's like these couple of little rock islands that stick up right there. And they'd just parked the boat. As soon as they parked the boat, boom. The sharks are on you. Sharks are pretty inquisitive anyways. Even when I've been on boats out in the ocean, fishing or diving, wasn't Papa New Guinea one time.

Speaker 1:          01:43:10       We pulled up everywhere. We anchored immediately be three to five, maybe more sharks on the boat. Did you come up from the deep check out? What is that? And to kind of disappeared. Then they're probably watching because they can, they know what's going on. But the great whites pop up. I think that day we saw about eight or 10 great whites, different sizes and ages and whatever. And uh, what about 500 yards away? There were guys surfing and I was like, this is fucking weird man. Like there's no way I'd be surfing and these guys surf there every day. And then there's a couple other spots. A couple of friends of mine like grew up in that area and they surf these reefs that are like right back where we came a mile a mile from there and the boat just on just on the outside of this harbor. And

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       there's kind kinda two ways of thinking. Like number one thing that bothers me with it is that dish, like sharks know where they got, they got a meal, sharks, they tagged sharks, they know they come back to a hunting place where they got a seal the year before or whatever and they're there at the same time. You know, they're, they're the same month or whatever. So like September, October, they're like here on the coast of California. Internal. Yeah. And then they go down to Guadalupe Island and then then they go out about a thousand miles off the coast and they believe they breed out there and then a lot of the females will go to Hawaii in the males that come back and kind of do that route, pick up the coast. But they, they. The craziest thing about these animals, they, they know how to just free swim. Like even if I'm swimming on the surface, I got to like put my head up and go, okay, where's the beach?

Speaker 2:          01:44:40       Whereas the, you know which direction I'm going. Imagine like they can just swim out in the ocean and find each other thousand miles from shore and breed out in the middle of nowhere. How do they, how do they do that and they all know to get to this place. You can imagine like fish smell. Imagine how bad shark pussy smells like real distinct. I don't know. I mean animals have crazy smells each other when they're breeding in. Oregon knows that there's a liver in that great white and he's gonna smash it and eat the liver out of that and leave the shark. How they smell that. That's what all Alpha males like in the packs, when they kill a thing, the Alpha male always eats to deliver. Wow. It's the most nutrient dense Oregon. Yeah. Well the. So what I don't like is that sharks I believe are equating, okay, I see a boat, I see a person, whatever that thing is, and he's got food, right?

Speaker 2:          01:45:34       I just don't like that equation. It's, it sucks. And all these shark week's and stuff, they're all filming off of Cape Town and they're, they're, they're. I think they're educating the sharks that, like you said, human, it's not fear, it's just not necessarily the person's food, but they have food and if they don't give it, it's like a spear fisherman shooting a fish. You don't give up. Your fish will bite you sometimes. Well, you know, that's the case in Kodiak Island with grizzly bears. They said the grizzly bears have gotten so used to the sound of a gunshot, meaning a deer's dead. Oh, they'll look towards the sound of a gunshot. Yeah. There's no. So they hear a gunshot. If someone shot a moose or someone shot a deer, that means that the dinner bill. Yeah. So they run towards gunshot sounds. You know, there's an island up in the Aleutians that has a bunch of Caribou on it.

Speaker 2:          01:46:22       You know about them, you know, and no bears. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to go home, my friend Adam Adam Green tree that we're just talking about a shot that a water buffalo about my head just shot a giant Moose and a grizzly bear stolen. No, in the Yukon last week. Wow. Not even last week. Three days ago. It might be still in his instagram story, but they took some meal eating that thing right now. Will the bear buried it? Buried it buried a jog and fucking magic? Well, it's an enormous bear. It's a bear in the Yukon. So you talked about and bear. Yeah, easily. 11 foot bear. So this bear buried his entire moves and it's all fucking huge. Moves. Like an 1800 try moving that moose one foot. Yeah. This bay or just picked it up and dug it? Yeah, like a front loader or one of those cranes just digs foundations for houses.

Speaker 2:          01:47:11       They just like, like the meat to rotten and they grind it well, they also want to cover it so the birds don't find it and then nothing else can see it. So they did giant. They'll cover the Moose and the Gi. He just decided it was his and so they were terrified. When they got there they found the Moose was covered. They knew it was a grizzly that did it because it was so big. So they just took some of the meat and ran pleasure. So primal, because they can only do so much at a time, but why would you even take any? I just get the fuck out of. I mean nothing comes back or smells you look at. That's the moose that shot size, that fucking thing. I mean that is a massive moves. A friend of mine got a moose last year, but he's got photos. Go to the photo of what he got out of the Moose from the bear. He got a bag. A small

Speaker 4:          01:47:56       bag might be that.

Speaker 2:          01:48:02       What does it say? This is not my kid anymore. Yeah, click on that. You can see the video like play that

Speaker 5:          01:48:07       very the whole mood. Come on, look at this whole booth is buried. Oh my gosh. That's my. Are you sure it wasn't a skunk ape. The detail. Look at that. Look, look, look, okay. I don't like this.

Speaker 1:          01:48:25       I would feel like we got the fuck out here. Plus their bow bowhunting. Don't even have guns. No guns. You ever hear that story of the guy who, the kid who was getting attacked by the bear, the grizzly running down a hill and his dad was looking up with a bow. You hear the story? No. You got to find this story. It's so sick. The Dad was looking at, the guy decides to go up this Ridge, this kid, he's like 25 years, 20 year old kid or whatever, and he's going up the ridge and he sees a couple bear cubs or whatever. And then, oh no, there's mom think comes after him. Just charge and he comes running back down the hill, but he straightened line with the, with the bear that dad is looking at him, pulled back, ready to let, let an arrow fly. And the kids exactly in line with the bear. Oh my God. And as the bears like getting to him, the kids kind of sidesteps and the dad lets it fly and it hits the bear in the heart and the baird falls on. The kid starts ripping at him and dies.

Speaker 4:          01:49:19       Whoa. Whoa.

Speaker 2:          01:49:23       Outdoor life. September 25, 2:37. So yeah. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:49:28       Elk Hunting? Yeah, Naomi pig got him and started tearing at him and died on him. Jesus Christ,

Speaker 2:          01:49:40       I passed my dad and I saw an arrow fly by my leg about two feet away. Dad kept it together. Tell you what. There's some serious target panic there. Yeah. You better go charging at you and your sons in front of you. Oh my God. I hate to wrap this up and I got to get out of here. It's already 6:30. I had a question for you please. I was talking about this with a couple of friends of mine that you are exposed to probably more information and people and and all that and more walks of life than maybe anybody in the world. You realize that everything about that because you get such a diverse group of people to come talk to you from politicians to chemists and scientists and athletes and you just know so much information about so many topics. It's really no light scattering.

Speaker 2:          01:50:28       Little for you know a little bit about everything. Sort of like sometimes. Sometimes I don't remember anyone being humble, but I mean I think it's cool because you're just in this sort of, in this, you're in this place where now that information is so readily available to you firsthand and definitely have learned a lot, but what's interesting is that this was never the plan. This is all just complete happenstance and good fortune. I mean there's this whole thing just started out talking shit with comedian friends. Yeah. Yeah. And then slowly but surely someone was like, I want to go on. I'm like, okay, come on. And then you know, I got like Anthony Bourdain was one of the first guests that was like a guest guest. And then were you buddies with him? Did you become friends? I was friends with him and sad thing it's fucking beyonce.

Speaker 2:          01:51:10       But like, yeah. So your experience now is your flow state. It's just like it's just happening. And is it you enjoy it? You know, I love it. I love watching into it. I look forward to meeting interesting people and meeting people like you and people like Neil degrasse Tyson or Graham Hancock or there's so many different people that can come on and talk about so many different fascinating things that maybe a lot of people just weren't exposed to the information for that. Um, just to wrap up that foot thing because I didn't enter, it'll be super short. I got a second surgery in February, put me off for about six weeks. I for about six weeks and I started getting good again and then I taught because my foot was so tight. I did like a turf toe terror on the bottom and I ripped the plantar fasciitis or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:51:59       So I've been fighting that, but I'm, I'm right back now. I'm going to start competing in December again. Nice. Um, so yeah, I wanted to go to one of those live where, where's. Is there anyone live around here? Any. Any competition that I could see a. not really around here. What would it have to go? Hawaii? Yeah, come to Hawaii when I went to the second week of December. Second Week? Yeah. It's in between. It's in between your fcs. I, there's actually, there's actually a billet door that week in Hawaii. Honolulu. That's right. Yeah. A friend of my card. Oh, I forget the card. My friend Dustin Barca is fighting on it though, man. I was planning on seeing fate or versus Ryan Bader. It was going to be at the bay door. Is that what happened in? Yeah, on the 26th. But now, um, what is it? November? No, December 26. Well, whatever the date is, there's a UFC now. Bummer. Yeah. I wanted to see him live, but there's a Bella tour. I mean, I don't know if you're. Are you contractually obligated to not go to those now? I can go. Yeah. Can Go. So there was one that week and the. We have a surf contest at pipeline. Who's on that belt or card? Because Michael Chandler, the main is Valerie laterno verse. I can't say her name. Mcfarland. You can say it. Go ahead. I don't know how to pronounce that.

Speaker 2:          01:53:15       Lima, Lima, farlane and Lima lay. Mcfarland. She must be how, what? In what? We should probably the local and the local car. Machida, I can't figure out this website, man. Liotta was great guy when he was undefeated and it was a bad motherfucker. That's a good fight. Even gracie and Ed Ruth. Ooh, that's a good fight. King. Oh, and Liam mcgeary. That's a good fight to Kona. He's a friend of mine. Kona. Olivera Oh, okay. He's a surfer guy. What a weird bell towards. Got a very strange website. Yeah. 15th. Is this car? This one. So that's the same week. And what island is this surf contest on a while? Husein. Ms Dot Lou. Oh, okay. That's on the north shore. I'll send you a sincere for cat. I'll tell you what days is running. Okay. If you want to try. If I can, I wouldn't try. I really want to see one live.

Speaker 2:          01:54:06       Yeah, I think it would be cool to be there. He's probably won't compete, but he'll probably do commentary for Shane's. Going to be here real soon. He's here the day of sober October. November fifth show. He got me in here early. You got you got me in. I did that. I don't drink, I don't drink much, but I was like, I was in Paris that we tobar started and I'll let you know, I'm just like going to my friend's restaurant every night and having a drink or two and stupid, you know, and so I just feel so much better not having even a beer, you know, it's just, it's a good look. I enjoyed it. Last year, last year we did 15 days of hot yoga. We had to do 15 hot yoga classes. Ninety minute classes. Yeah. That was kind of a pain in the ass. This year is way more of a pain in the ass.

Speaker 2:          01:54:45       This year we're doing this crazy fitness competition where we're wearing this my zone heart rate monitor and you get a certain amount of points for every minute you're in, you know, like 80 percent of your max heart rate. Seventy percent of your max heart rates every day. You're just, dude, I worked out for five and a half hours today. Five and a half hours. I'm trying to kill my friend. I served for five hours yesterday and I'm not dead. I just haven't served much later. I'm not bullshitting. I worked for. Worked out for five people. You're exaggerating. No, it's documented. I did. Much of that is 913 points. How many shitting their pants right now? How many? Nine. Twenty nine. Before I quit. How many minutes? Do you know how many minutes today you were? Eighty percent heart rate or whatever hours. All those yellow hours this month? Yes. No, today. Today I was at ours at 80 percent of couple hours.

Speaker 2:          01:55:35       More like three. Wow. Because the reality is at 80 percent of my max heart rate, it had to be because 913 you get 240. What's the per minute to end game is I win nobody. I mean do you go do a triathlon afterwards? I'm in fucking crazy shape right now. I'll tell you that you are. I may go on and I'm like freaking ripped, but I mean I've, I've, I've literally never been in better cardiovascular shape in my life when it works out for five and a half fucking hours today. So what do you do? Anything with that besides just feel good like like just trying to get my belt. Will we have a championship belt, like a wwe belt at the end of this intergalactic champion to sober October and I'm just trying right now. I'm trying to literally kill my friends that are trying to compete you at me.

Speaker 2:          01:56:18       I want, I want them to regret getting into this competition with me because I don't think they totally understood how fucking crazy I am. And so this thing started heating up and I told them I'm going to do 929 points everyday. Right now. 1,600 points ahead of second place. Do you ever fast. Have you fasted fuckers? No. No, no. I've done intermittent fasting fast, like 16 hours but never liked the master cleanse for 10 days or so. No. I like food too much, but I do enjoy intermittent fasting. I like to do 16 hours. I've done like nine, 10 day fasts. Master cleanse, but do that. I recommend it just because you get all this stuff out of your colon that looks like your colon. It's like old poop and it real. I swear to God, I came out of my body, I thought I pooped out my colon.

Speaker 2:          01:57:04       So it's like when you haven't eaten in like two days now, how much you shitting? You still know that y'all used to poop the poop everyday. A little bit. Yeah. Wow. That's crazy. That's got to. This stuff comes out of your gut. They call mucoid plaque. You can google that and it. It is like 20, 30, 40 years of stuff built up from the mucus your body creates when it doesn't like what you're eating and that goes down and it gets stuck on this, on the walls of your intestines and it's like tire rubber and you poop it out. It looks exactly like the shape of your intestine. I thought it was my intestines. So you thought you should out part of your body. I did. It was freaky. And how how good you feel and this is over. You look, latency, pull it up, pull it up.

Speaker 2:          01:57:48       I didn't believe it was real and I got it and it's like weird flap. That is nuts. Yeah. I got something that does look like intestine. Yeah, it looks like intestine dude. It's gross. So that's what comes after your nutrients. Have to go through that to get Kiddo. How long? Well maybe I'll do that right after I'm done with sober October. When Google the master class, because you're drinking a tea of like maple syrup, lemon and Cayenne pepper for how many times? I kinda like it. I did it for 10 days. Ten days. No food. Just that. Whoa. Yeah, but I got that stuff coming out after about five days because I was really aggressive with the. You do a salt water flush every day, every morning and then you take this smooth move tea that makes you kind of like go to the bathroom. Well, I'll tell you one thing that I had been doing because I've been sweating so much.

Speaker 2:          01:58:36       I videotaped one day the sweat puddles that are left in the jar. I watched that and then I set off my alarm fire alarm in my gym from my sweat and today it was so bad. That was when you lapped the field of your friends? Yeah. Today was so bad too because today I did the longest that I've ever worked out, but um, I know your nutrition is good too, so I mean, but you gotta be thinking about what's going out in what you got to put back in. That's one of the things I've been drinking water with electrolytes and I'm adding salt. I'm adding Himalayan salt to the water, but I may be added too much and when I talk about just forget diarrhea, not really diarrhea kids, it's basically water coming out of my ass because it's, I mean it would be like, I would feel it be like you don't pay it all.

Speaker 2:          01:59:28       Oh boom. It was like opening flood gates and gallons of water would come out of my ass. Most people should do that like once or twice a month. Two tables, two teaspoons of salt in one liter of water or a quarter water, banging it. Your body sees it as food, not as P, right? It just means you have to stay home for that one. I wasn't staying home. I would just jump off the treadmill for five minutes. Take a volume is shit of water was basically water coming out of my asshole, but it probably cleans up a lot. Right. It cleans. It cleans you out. Yeah. There was stuff. Weird stuff floating around in there. I didn't know what that was. Maybe body uses so much energy for digestion. Yeah, but I got these guys that fall in line to do water fast, like every month and they're doing a five to 10 day water fast coming up this week.

Speaker 2:          02:00:12       I'm not going to participate in that one, but I want to do a fast soon. So. Great. How much did you look forward to that drink, that tea with the law? I mean if you're not. I really enjoyed calories. Yeah, really enjoyed it. It was a lot of weight. I lost. Yeah. I didn't weigh myself, but I think I lost 10 to 12 pounds. That's a lot. I really appreciated. I was pretty sure I did, but I was thin too, you know. But then you build back at that first date I ate afterwards, you know, it was like the best food I ever had my gun, you know, just like you've never deep 10 whole days of just the tea. Yeah. Wow. And, and uh, and a salt water flush every day and the smooth move tea, which I was doubling up on. So I was, because I didn't have the full 14 days, so I'm like I got to go fast.

Speaker 2:          02:00:56       But I was getting stomach cramps because I was eating, drinking too much of that tea. I'll try that. Yeah, I'll give that a shot. At least Google it and look and, and, but when you can, when you can abstain from food, it's, it's like you could quit heroin or some people are so addicted to food. Look at people thing because of this. Like I'm the amount of calories that I'm consuming. Like let me tell you how much I burned today because it's so goddamn insane. Today I burned. I mean this doesn't even, it doesn't even seem real. But I burned 4,217 calories during this workout. Yeah. That's a or you just circuiting the whole time, ran the hills around two miles with my dog in the hills, which believe it or not, you don't get many fucking points for it because it's think sucks. It's way harder than the other things that I'm doing because it's basically straight up, but I'm just trying to.

Speaker 2:          02:01:45       I have a two year old golden retriever and he's got so much goddamn energy. He's the best, but I got to wear his ass out. Otherwise he annoys. Everybody jumps up on people who just needs attention, but when I run with them he's just chill. So I'll do two miles in the. What do you got here and just give you. I'm going to plug my buddy sunlife. I love this stuff. What is this one that's a dawn patrol. It's like cold brew coffee, coconut, a coconut cream, coconut sugar. Anyways, you go into my time, but I do. I go in there all the time in depth. Courageous. I. They have great everything. Yeah, just awesome. I really live there. Sometimes they'll spend half the day there and get to my meals. Got Bone Broth to enbrel. I love the bone broth that he. It's like his Kahleel special style.

Speaker 2:          02:02:34       Yeah. Yeah. With the Cayenne pepper and that's fucking sensational. Was I saying, oh, but that's not good for that many points. No system. Not Gauging the going up hill. It's like it's more grinding. It's like just if you get to 80 percent of your max heart rate and just grind. You guys got money on this thing?
