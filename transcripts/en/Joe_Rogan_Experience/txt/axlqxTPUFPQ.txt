Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience,

Speaker 2:          00:02          but the beautiful thing about boxing is that with everything wrong in the world, and I hate to use this cliche, this terminology, but you know we'd live being unfair because I don't like to use that because. Because sometimes people nowadays, for me, there's too many excuses out there. There really are. There's too many damn excuses. You in this country, you got a chance to do some where you don't have in other places, but having said that, he can feel like life's not fair sometimes. Supposedly when you think about some of the things we just talked about in a day that's gone now, it's not there no more, but. Well, Dave Lewis and all those kind of people. Life wasn't fair that really they really had a right to use that say nowadays, I don't think people have a white black, purple. They don't have a right to say that to the extent that they did back then. Not to the extent. No, no, they don't. They really lose all the things wrong or they're messed up. People still out there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But sometimes it's too easy to use that. Yes. It's just too easy. I agree. So. But there was a time when life too often was unfair. Ruthlessly unfair. Really unfair. Were ruthlessly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:24          And when life was unfair, boxing was around to make it fair. And I'll tell you how on one given night, if you worked hard enough, if you dream big enough, if you were tough enough and you made yourself tough enough, you sacrificed enough, it became polished and savvy enough and and technically equipped to do things that you had. And you learn those things and you just work yourself to the ball. No matter where you came from, no matter what part of the world, no matter what, who your parents were, no matter what your poverty level may have been made, not a bit, no matter what you had, what you didn't have, no matter what people had told you, didn't tell you all of that. If you made yourself and took advantage of that opportunity and get yourself ready, you already to behave like a champion. You could get in that ring on one given night and make the world fair and have your hand lifted view called champion of the world that makes box and special

Speaker 1:          02:49          and it's also, I think in some ways there's a leveling of the playing field that a lot of these ideologies present to some people where they, they go, no, you're not a freak. You're okay. You know this. There was some silly article on fat acceptance the other day and it was talking and then they got some proposed, which is fine. Um, I accept people who drink except I've accept all kinds of unhealthy choices, but listen, don't lie to me. Just don't lie about the physical reality of what you've done to your body. If you reach 400 pounds, that's not, that's not healthy. You're saying it's healthy. You're saying it's okay. No, you're just not dead yet. If you lost 200 pounds, you would feel wonderful. That would be healthier. Like if you smoke every day and you're like, look, no, cancer, smoking is healthy. No, no, you just, you just, your body is dealing with it.

Speaker 1:          03:41          Your body's processing it. It won't be able to forever. That is exactly what's going on. If you're morbidly obese and for you to pretend any differently and to just go on about this fat acceptance movement and you know the big beautiful this and that and like, no, you're obese. You've eaten too much food. If you see a fat guy, how come he doesn't get the same sort of treatment? Have you see a morbidly obese man and his underwear? No one's saying he's beautiful because he's disgusting and he's fat and he's lazy and he's. He's addicted to food. We all know it, but if it's a woman were so inclined to like accept just, okay, I'll let her go. She's fine. You're wonderful. You're beautiful. You're amazing. Like can give her her space. We treat them as if they're incapable of recognizing the absolute reality of their physical being. I don't know how you feel about mumble rap, but mumble rap is one of the weirdest things

Speaker 3:          04:40          to me. It's. I'm confused. It's bizarre. It's bizarre what is happening. I just, I feel like I feel like I don't want to be that dude who doesn't get it right. You know what I mean? You don't get it. I don't get it either I don't. But when you start dealing with youth culture and when I was the age of these mumble rap kids, they were older heads saying, yeah, you know, the, the generation before roster, the cold crush brothers to the big daddy kane. So they probably thought what we were doing was crazy. So is that what's happening? I don't know. Maybe everyone's like, what the fuck is that? It's like I, it's to the point with me where I'm like, Yo, is that even a genre of rap? Right? Like I almost look at it. I guess I don't, I guess I don't have a problem with it because I don't process it as anything close to what I do. It's almost like if you said, Yo, what are you think about Edm? I'd be like, oh, I don't know. August. Is that right? It's, I don't even look at it like I can't listen to that. And then let him hear big daddy Kane and think it's the same thing.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Kids listening to music. Right. If you were listening to something that you enjoyed, one of the things you loved was good lyrics of course, and when you can understand what they're saying.

Speaker 3:          05:51          Yeah. And it's also, it's just so driven by phrase driven. Yeah. They just, whatever the and over and over and over again. Yeah. I don't know if it's just because these kids are doing my alley or whatever and they're just in the zone. Is it drug culture? Because that's happened before Tuesday, you know, one thing creates the other, it's like chicken or the egg. Are these kids doing molly and make mumble rap or they don't mumble rap and they eat molly and it's all, it's, you know, the sixties, you going back to the fifties and beatniks and that scene and jazz and heroin and w w what created it, you know what I mean? That miles and Coltrane make some of those records because they were on heroin or vice versa. And it's happened historically. Is this just a drug driven culture? I don't know because I'm detached, you know, I'm detaching that and I, and you know, I'm, I'm a kid who grew up, you know, listening to metal and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          06:42          So I, I don't, I'm not at a shortage for Oleson to slayer. I'll just listen to slayer before I listened to that. If that's my only option, then I'll listen to slayer. You know what I mean? I listened to black flag, I listen to minor threat. That's what I'll do, you know? So whether I, however I feel about it becomes irrelevant when you realize that you have so much good shit out there. So I don't need. It's like with film, like I'm not worried about a bad movie. I just watched the dope movie. There's so many movies thrown them away. Right. And it's like, Yo, I was just listening to thin lizzy if I, if I don't feel like adjusting to that, you know what I mean? And there's other things that we might not get because we're not doing what we used to do. Maybe I was a bar of the clubs five nights a week and you weren't married with kids and we were hammered maybe a challenge, different time and place yet

Speaker 1:          07:37          because, uh, I am baffled by this carnivore diet. Yes. And baffled. I'm baffled by how many people are cleaning to it as a panacea. I'm baffled by whether or not it's a physiological effect or whether there's a placebo effect going on. I have a theory please. Yeah. So

Speaker 4:          07:58          my theory is that it mimics some of the benefits of fasting, um, but allows people to persist for longer because it's providing some nutrition. You know, most, if you look in the scientific literature, fasting is the cure all for everything. I mean, like you can look at any condition and fasting is the cure time, water fasting. So you can do it for two, three, four weeks from his, tried that for a year. That will be the cure for life in that case. The longest example is a year of Waterford. So most people are not at that last, uh, it was, he was extremely obese of energy stores this fat stores. Right? So that's one thing about that was that he actually his skin trank to right, which is really, yeah. Which doesn't usually happen with weight loss. So this is just a theory. I have nothing to.

Speaker 4:          08:47          No, I don't have any evidence, but we meet as absorbed very high up in the digestive tract. And so when you only eat, it's a low residue diet and there's nothing leftover to irritate or inflame the gut. My theory is a lot of people who are benefiting from this have really disrupted gut microbiome. Alessio Fasano has argued that leaky gut is kind of a preconditioned for autoimmunity and this, the carnivore diet is, it's essentially like a gut rast or a fast. And so I don't doubt that people are benefiting from it. The question is what is the long term implication?

Speaker 5:          09:22          Yeah, I mean I, I'm not anti Quito, I'm not anti Vegan. I'm anti bullshit. And one of the problems we have is nutrition is replacing religion for a lot of people. So you find something that you identify with and then people start to try to say because they identify with that movement or like for example, vegans, they identify with many of them, uh, protection of animals, not my job to judge their ethics and that sort of thing, but then they kind of try to backtrack to find the science to support them as well and they, they pick and choose. And this is guilty of all groups, not just vegans. This is also a lot of key digital diet cell. It's a carnivore diet, whatever have you. If it has the word diet, they're zealots out there who are going after it. And I will stick up for.

Speaker 5:          10:10          I've stuck up at a scientific conference for the Ketogenic Diet. Uh, you were, we were having a round table about something different and somebody said, well, we know that the key to genic diet in prayers, exercise performance and endurance athletes. And I said, I don't think that's necessarily true. Uh, you know, the, the, it's pretty ambivalent or ambiguous as to whether or not it does. It seems to be kind of individual. Um, but on the whole, on the average, it doesn't seem to impair exercise performance, so it's kind of what you like, but when you have people who you know, like, like a Gary Taubes, who says, well, calories don't matter, it's all carbohydrates, that sort of thing, or the carbohydrate, insulin model of obesity. I mean, the research is you're able to do a lot of hand waving about insulin and you know, where you burn so much fat when you're on a high fat diet, which is true by the way you, you burn a lot of fat, but what they don't talk about is that it's, it's overall fat balance, how much fat you store versus how much fat you burn.

Speaker 5:          11:07          And when you're on a high fat diet, you store a lot of fat, you also burn a lot of fat. The overall caloric balance is what determines whether or not you will have net storage or net deposition. This same thing for high carb diet as well. You know, this idea that with high insulin it just completely shuts down all fat burning everywhere. That's just not true. Now, if you have high carbohydrate, you will burn less fat, but you're also storing less fat as well. And again, the net caloric balance is going to be what determines how much you store because you don't really store carbohydrates as fat. For most people. They did a study, a overfeeding women where they overfed them 50 percent above their caloric maintenance and they found that of 282 grams of fat that they stored during the day and adipose. Only four grams came from carbohydrate. Two hundred and 78 came from fat.
