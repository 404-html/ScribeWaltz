Speaker 2:          00:08:04       Awesome podcast. How many episodes do you have now? I just put up episode 26. Jesus. Louisa, can you believe that? Number one, you were number one and I do it weekly and you, you inspired me. You and your listeners inspired me to do this. Well, you're, you're born for this. This is a perfect venue for you. I'm telling you. Thank you. By the way, but I'm telling you when I left your studio the last time I was on, I probably got 300 tweets from people saying, start your podcast. It's awesome. It was great. It was so great. That's so cool. You already have 26 of them. That's incredible. How did you do that? So fast? He just do them weekly and it's been that long. It's been 26 weeks, so it's been six months essentially in March or April. That's awesome though. That's so cool that you did it. You, you need something like this because you know, whenever you deal with a lot of producers

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       or you know, network folk think they mean well, but they all, everyone has their own idea of what should happen and even if they're nice people it gets in the way. It's so true. And like I, you know right now I contribute to, to different television shows and I'm very lucky I'm a freelancer. I'm a contributor so I work on a show on Al Jazeera America called Techno, which is a great science kind of news magazine style show. And then I work on a local show here in la called soquel connected, which is on Kct, which used to be our pbs affiliate and now it's just a, um, a public television kind of standalone. And that's great. I have great producers. I get to self produce some stuff. It's wonderful. Prior to only doing those and the podcast, I was full time on a show called take power, live on pivot TV.

Speaker 3:          00:09:42       That was daily eight to 12 hours a day every day, you know, hair and makeup for two hours straight. Basically two hours. Yeah. Was trying to turn you into a werewolf saying absolutely didn't look like he wasn't allowed to wear my hair straight, wasn't allowed to wear black, wasn't a law. It was crazy. Like I couldn't have rules. Very strict. I could not be myself on that show. And I look back and that is really when the podcast started because I was so, like you said, kind of boxed into speaking only in sound bites and presenting a version of myself that honestly I was not comfortable really presenting the podcast was a really, really necessary outlet. Like it was so psychologically freeing for me and now I think it really helps keep me centered and anchored when I do new jobs and new work to really understand how not to let things get out of him like that.

Speaker 3:          00:10:35       The best representative of yourself is yourself. You got a bunch of people like deciding what you should do. I think it'd be great if you wore pink. Oh look what you should be in paint that legitimate like I did. They made me wear pain. Like it was crazy and I had to wear my hair out curly. I read it and they hated that and I don't know, man. I think it's because I was the only girl on the show at the time. It was like very male heavy and I was supposed to be like the representative of the female species, which was like, come on. I'm kind of a tomboy. Like it wasn't really working for me. It was a lot of short skirts too. Which is weird for me. Like I like to wear black leather, but yeah. Anyway, and we've talked about it many times in the podcast about how you watch Fox News and all those women who like, it's almost like they have it in their contract that they have to uncross and crossed her legs like a certain amount of times per minute because it's like who the fuck is that uncomfortable that you're shifting and switching your legs back and forth and if a man dressed like that, it would be so insane.

Speaker 3:          00:11:37       Oh, can you imagine saying because there are, you know, if you watch runway shows ever, you keep up with fashion at all. There are kind of male versions of that sort of ensemble, but nobody actually. Where's that in real life. Like the short kind of tight, maybe not up to

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       your nut sack, but like halfway down your thigh, these little like plaid shorts and then he will, you know, it's very runway, but even those are shorts. There's something crazy about a skirt. Yeah, I agree. I mean it's just like easy access. It's the most ridiculous invention. It's like your vagina, which is your coveted sexual organ. I mean, this is like, this is where the babies come out, this is where you let the loved ones in this so much to the vagina and yet it's there protected by the thinnest piece of fabric. If, if we've seen all these little teeny bopper celebrities and their little woopsies getting in and out of cars oopsies where there just happened to be cameras right down near the vagina is like, that's not a website. Such shit was engineered. What's the reasoning behind that? I should have a cooter. Why would you want to do that? Some people want to look at it.

Speaker 2:          00:12:45       I don't want that to be Clark Clark with me. I'll never forget what he said about vaginas because he's of a different persuasion. He goes firsthand saw vagina. I was like, when's it going to heal? But it is a weird thing. I mean that you're presented as a serious journalist on Fox News or as a neuroscientist, which is what you are, and yet they want you to have your vagina basically just barely protected by a little, a little napkin that they throw over it. No, thank you. And always the cameras are, you know, right at the midlines, the midline of the table and so it's, it's just like an unflattering or, or ultra flattering depending on how you look at an angle that just makes you feel really exposed. It's. Yeah. How are you supposed to take somebody seriously? That it's. It doesn't make you any hotter.

Speaker 2:          00:13:37       That's where people are confused. Yeah. You don't have to. I think it's a little better sometimes to leave things up to the imagination. Yeah. Well, I mean, no it's not, but I'm saying like maybe not on tv, on the news news. What's your. Yeah. What's your objective? I mean, is it better in real life? Well, no. Well I don't know. Depends on what you're trying to do, but if you're on a show where you're just trying to like talk about issues, it's distracting. It's distracting to have like this really sexy outfit on and I think that's half the reason why these fucking Fox News type shows do that. Barbara Walters never dressed like that can be corrected, but she, you know, not too too scandalous. But she did wear short skirts and I was actually just watching, so I'm gonna get a little more comfortable. I'm very short and I feel tiny in this chair. Um, so I'm just crossing my legs. So I was watching this documentary called misrepresentation. Have you seen this? I'm about to get like super feminist on the show really early, just so I can piss off like everybody on twitter. Um, so actually really good documentary. It's called misrepresentation. You can find it on Netflix and it was produced and I'm kind of narrated by Jennifer Siebel newsome, who Gavin newsome's wife and

Speaker 3:          00:14:51       the whole thing is kind of about media representations of women, how women are portrayed, how women, you know, make up x amount of the population, x amount of the jobs in this field and this field and this field and then how they're represented both in fictional television but also in nonfiction programming. And they talk a little bit about that, kind of why our female news readers meant to look. So I'm sexy. It's always kind of like the crusty old dude. And then like his hot and nice, like that's what it looks like when you look it up, a news reading team, um, and, and they have these great interviews with people like Lisa Ling and Katie couric and kind of talking about Katie actually is very open and says I kind of feel guilty like almost I played into this like maybe I set this trend in motion and um, you know, I was fit.

Speaker 3:          00:15:43       I wore, you know, not ridiculously short skirts, but you could see my legs on TV. And then it seems like that's now the formula that every news reader has to have. And you almost just assumed that they're dumb. Like it, it, it portrays. I, I don't think it portrays strength. Unfortunately. When you have these girls that are women that look like they're trying so hard to be sexy, then all of a sudden it puts it in your head like, oh, she's just reading a script that somebody else wrote for her. When sometimes these are really, really bright, really successful women. Like why do you want? Or just they just want people to watch it and they just feel like the best way to hook people is sex. Yeah. And, and the truth is they also, in the documentary, they showed all of the major news corporation, which there aren't that many anymore, you know, they've been kind of conglomerating and, and uh, more and more of the property is owned by less and less people and they showed the number of women on the board, on the board of all of these different news organizations.

Speaker 3:          00:16:42       And so you look at like Time Warner or you look at Viacom and it's like one woman, two women, you know, to women and as opposed to like 30 men are 15 men. The people that are making the shows and the people who have ultimate control over those kinds of decisions historically and to this day are like 99 percent male. I wonder if that's why I like women like Megan Kelly, that Fox lady who's not at all, she's very sharp. She's kind of mean, kind of got an edge to her wonder if it's like to like let you know, hey fuck face. Just because I've got my tits hanging out in my legs are crisscrossed, barely covered my cooter. I'll still put you in your place where she's on her heels all the time. I'd always backed up. Yeah. I don't think it's an uncommon feeling for women who are just in a position where they're surrounded by men who just are going to assume when they walk in the door that she's just dumb bimbos she's a weather girl. She's a news reader, but really she's writing her own copy and doing her own research and it a really strong smart. I mean, I disagree with like fucking everything she says, but I've seen her be a total brilliant on air before.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       She's slightly more rational than most of the people in that network. That's not saying much because she can be pretty rational, but she, you know, she's right wing. That's just, that's her thing. She's like a real Santa Claus is white. Is that her kapow she's hot as fuck. That's very distracting, right? It is. But it's also usually looks like that on. That's what you should do. Just fucking work it all the way deep. Ridiculous. She should do the news from a bed all day. All the news should be done from silk sheets. She's got her tits highlighted. Yeah, she does. They're different colored. Yeah. That's an interesting. I mean, come on, wardrobe, dry. She basically has a two tone thing with the tits or impossible to not look at because they don't blend in at all. And that's the thing. It's like they really push you.

Speaker 2:          00:18:34       I remember on um, take part live one day wearing one of my favorite looks, which was like black pants, high heels, a white button down shirt that was fitted. I mean I think that the outfit was, I consider it like a hot outfit and a black tie and, but I had my hair braided and kind of pulled back and I was wearing glasses and my producer told me that I couldn't dress like that anymore because it was too masculine. Look like a girl. Like it's obvious that I'm not trying to be a dude. I like to wear ties. Producer guy. No, no. You don't have to say no, he wasn't. It wasn't. No. Maybe he really was. No, he wasn't for sure he wasn't where he thought you look masculine like that. No, I mean, I dunno. It's like put on a short skirt and and you get that thing to where even if they don't overtly tell you, it's like you get off air every night and when you're dressed in an outfit that you love, like pants a shirt, like you feel comfortable but you feel good about yourself and you look in the mirror and you think your body looks good.

Speaker 2:          00:19:29       It's like whatever. Okay, fine. Show whatever you were like the dumbest little short pink skirt or dress that you're totally uncomfortable in and you're not acting like yourself. You look great to know like in your ifb, like in your, in your ears, because they're constantly, they're like in your ear, like that's gross to the ifps are gross. I know it's horrible having someone talk to you, especially if you're in the middle of a conversation and they're difficult that or don't say this or bringing this back and bring up that are asked this. It's tough. It's tough. Especially when there's tension between you and your producer when not hiding it. When I do post fight interviews, when I first started doing it, they used to talk to me in my ear like way back in the day, like sometimes it'd be in midsentence and there'd be some fucking clueless shithead on the other end.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       You know, it hasn't happened in decades because then the new guys are awesome. The guys that have been doing it for, but in the nineties when I did it, there would be a guy talking. I literally had to take the thing out of my ear because I couldn't concentrate on what I was saying and they have a meltdown in the booth when they see you take it out of your year. I don't know what it's like. You can't. You literally can't form a sentence. First of all, when you're doing post fight interviews, you're doing it in real time off the cuff, completely ad libbed and you're. You're asking questions and adjusting based on how the fighter talks to you. They don't understand like even a good producer will be like, well, I never talked to you while you're talking. I wait until you stop talking. It's like, yeah, but I have to fucking hear with the person I'm interviewing says to me, you literally can't hear you.

Speaker 2:          00:20:56       Someone to talk to you here and you're talking. I don't hear it. No, you can't hear it all and it's, it's the same thing that show I was on was a live show every night, so I get it counting down to commercial. The things where you have to keep time. Hey guys, we gotta wrap it up. We've only got a minute left. Great. But like just the talking and the talking or you should say this. It's like fuck you. I'm not going to say that to say what I want to say. Well that's the beautiful thing about the Internet. You know, the beautiful thing about the internet and producing your own show and creating your own show is I kind of look at those old shows, the shows that have been around for a long time like that. Especially those news type shows we talked about like the the uncle and the niece and the like, that kind of weird format where they talk fake and it's everything.

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       Seven minutes cut to commercial. I feel like that's a dinosaur. I really don't think that's gonna. I mean I don't think it's going to last for people, sort of our generation. I use that loosely, but I think most of middle America is still watching that kind of traditional television in America gets the Internet two. They do. That's true. That's true. America is not middle America anymore. I think most of middle America, I mean they're. They're watching what's on because it's always been there, but people are way more hip. Yeah, they are. But tell him when you go on the road, don't you feel it, Brian, when you go to Ohio and all these different places like that used to be like a little behind. They're not really behind anymore and there's a lot of fucking slick people that are living in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, absolutely. I think that's what's great about everything.

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       I mean, I just got rid of cable from my first time in for once. I'm like choosing what I want to watch instead of just like, oh, what's on TV right now? So you're kind of directing, but what are these Middle America people picking out? Stupid Shit. Like I wanna watch this. Slowly but surely though they're getting more hip. No, I think so too. I think part of the problem though is that, I mean you look at the statistics and Fox News is still the most watched news network. Like what does that say about our country? What says? First of all, they don't really know what the fuck people are watching because the Nielsen ratings are ridiculous. That's true. It's the most antiquated way of figuring out. It's the only thing that's worse is the arbitron. When they try to figure out who's listening to radio, that Shit's ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:22:59       I could give you a book and you're supposed to carry it around and write down. When you listened to this channel, when you listen to that channel like they don't fucking know. What ends up happening is that people represent themselves to be different than they are. They're like, I love NPR when they like never listened to npr because they think it looks good as well. There's that thing that they do on networks as well where they'll. They'll like, if you're on a talk show, especially the. They have the ratings based on how many people are watching up into a certain point. Like that's why the tonight show has a 20 minute break because 15 minutes in is when they do their first rating so they don't want to cut to commercial because then you'll change the channel fuck up the ratings. So they have this 20 minute things so everything is geared towards like keep watching us, look at us.

Speaker 2:          00:23:44       We're going to do something crazy and they just. It's like sweeps every night duties, do anything to try to get you to hang in there for 20 minutes and then they'll bring someone on and that's what the skirts are all about and that's why you have all these people that their sensibility is not based on what's the best way to get caris thoughts out. What's the best way to get megan's thoughts out? The thing is, how do I get someone to watch this chick? Oh, completely. And also there is a problem I think where people say, okay, well people in the industry, especially when you talk to them about this, they go, well, whatever. We just give people what they want. So you look at like bad reality tv where there's cat fights and humiliation television and all the shit that, you know, the Kardashians, all the shit that we're like a breaks my heart that this is so popular in America.

Speaker 2:          00:24:26       And then people say, well that's what the people want and we're just answering to what their needs are. You know, we're not actually effecting any sort of social change. We're just playing into the hands of, of, of what they're interested in. But I say that that's fucking bullshit because we have an illusion of choice in this country. Like we don't have viable options. If I want to watch the news, I've either got Fox News, MSNBC or CNN. Those are the things that are easy for me to find. I probably, unless I haven't expanded cable package, don't have al Jazeera or BBC World News or another option or rt or another option available to me. So I'm watching this programming that's no longer even news. It's just fucking advertiser blow jobs and like ratings run offs. You know, our team, an interesting example is kind of a fucked up channel that rt is very like in the one hand there's amazing reporting happening there and in the other hand it's like answers to the Kremlin.

Speaker 2:          00:25:27       It's so weird. Abby Martin is a friend of mine. She's been on the show several times and she's great and she's one of the rare people that can kind of dress however she wants. She dresses, she wore slacks should wear. I mean she's very pretty, but she'll wear, you know, she'll wear something that makes it look hot and then if that's what she wants to wear or she'll wear something different. But she has a weird situation there too where she's criticized Russia, like especially what's going on in the Ukraine and you know, and they were like, we're going to send you to the Ukraine. And she's like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, the fuck you are like, no, you're not sending me to the Ukraine. They like made a publicly or press statement because she was, she was criticizing Putin's administration and what, what was going on and you know, was very public on television.

Speaker 2:          00:26:09       She did this thing and so they said, we're going to send her to, to Crimea so she can see what it's like on the ground. She's like, Yo, you're fucking mind. I'm not going to a war zone. What did you guys, you didn't talk to me like, you know, this is not happening. I'm just telling you right now. It's not happening. But it's weird. It's a weird place. I've, for Russia, I'm pretty good friends with um, a loaded mankowski and Jenny Churchill who used to work at rt on the aloneness show back in the day and then they went over to huff post and we're at huff post live, which is, um, where I kind of met them. And that's where the science editor. Yeah, that's where I was their science correspondent. There was a science editor in New York. I did all their correspondent, like on air work, um, and so I met them there and yeah, they've told me some pretty interesting stories too about our t and a lot of stuff has been leaked lately, like you see it, like the reporters there have been more and more open about the fact that there's an obvious agenda at that news network and I feel like when it comes to Russia reporting you have to take it with a huge grain of salt, but they do a good job of investigative reporting in other parts of the world.

Speaker 2:          00:27:15       And also what's interesting is everybody that knows about our t primarily knows about it from clips that were released on the Internet. Yeah. They, they're really good about their social media and videos. It's a big reality when it comes to all those new shows too and all those tonight show and talk shows their, their whole thing is get a clip that pops it completely. Something that you could put on television and the or put on television, but then people will make a clip of it and put it on Youtube. I mean look at Snl, obviously people still watch it if you want to believe Nielsen ratings, but like that show is not good anymore. It hasn't been good in a really long time, but they really reinvented themselves with the digital shorts a few years ago and as those were getting released, I mean there was this new kind of resurgence of young people being like, oh, snl is actually funny.

Speaker 2:          00:28:02       It's not so kind of worn out and old. Yeah, it's the whole problem with this and there's a bunch of problems but trying to do a new show every week and then just doing it live in front of an audience. Just a terrible idea and they don't have any. It's like make it a half hour show. Like don't make it an out. Because what ends up happening is they have good ideas for clips and then they just, every, every single sketch, they just run it into the ground. It's just like they get the joke and then they repeat it 10 times. It's also like a super competitive environment and you know Phil Hartman, who was a good friend of mine, we were on Newsradio together and he was on Saturday night live and he had a nightmare stories like after talking to him about what it was like the backstabbing and all the weird behind the scenes shit that goes on.

Speaker 2:          00:28:46       People trying to force their, their sketches in and other people cock blocking them. It was just like, oh, that sounds horrible. Worst thing, the worst way to come up with something creative. Like they have this like weird competitive environment. Like no one's supporting it. I mean, I don't know how it is there now, but he told me some nightmare stories. Yeah, there were times when it was really amazing, but yeah, there was. There were some times Eddie Murphy days, there's, you know, I mean it's, you're always going to have talented people who are capable of being funny under extreme circumstances can put them in the worst scenario and they could figure out how to make something funny occasionally, but you're right, like it would be better if it were much looser, but it's TV. Be Better if they had time, like you need to work on a sketch like a once a month sign and drive specials would probably be a fucking nuclear bomb. That was really bad. That's true, but people have these expectations and they want to live up to those expectations and they want to keep up with the ratings and make enough money and all the old school

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       tv model is I, I don't know how much life it has left in it. The problem is that's where the money is still. It's a legacy model. It's all of the investors, all of the advertisers. It's how they know how to do their jobs because they've been doing it for so long that they still pumped so much money into that machine. I mean, I see it as a freelancer when I get offered a TV job. It always pays better than a web job across the board. That's where the money is still in, in and. And that's where my agent is trying to push me. I do a lot of web work because I like new media and I like that. I can be free on it, but the truth is we're still in this kind of legacy world with, with old school media and until those large corporations start to understand new media, I think that you're going to see this weird inflated bubble where all the money's still stays there, but nobody's even fucking watching anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:30:33       It's adjusting. It's adjusting slowly. But it's, it's, it's definitely, uh, in this transitionary period where more people are kind of realizing, hey, isn't everybody on line? Everyone is online, right? So isn't it aren't the same people that are online also watching television shows like we can reach them in both ways and then it will slowly shift. In my opinion, it's going to shift to the Internet almost entirely. I really don't see. The only benefit that I could see a networks is things like game of thrones where you need massive budgets to put on these spectacular special effects and everything in Ireland.

Speaker 3:          00:31:07       You know what I mean? So I think you will be able to see and what happens when those production companies or when Hbo Rolls Out and it becomes a standalone app where you don't need the cable provider anymore, then fuck, that's online too. I mean, the only things that I appointment view anymore at all on television are masters of sex. What does that? Um, it's on showtime. Oh, is that the Kinsey thing? Well, it's masters and Johnson, so different researchers. But yeah, sex researchers from the fifties.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       So this is like that movie was Liam Neeson. Who the fuck

Speaker 3:          00:31:39       is that the Kinsey movie? Yeah. So, so the Kinsey and then I don't remember, but Kinsey and masters and Johnson are probably the most cited sex research, historical sex researchers in psychology courses where you learned about sexual behavior, but masters and Johnson a really interesting thing because masters was an ob Gyn. Johnson was his research assistant and they fucked a lot and that's show. And so they got. They were the source of a lot of their research. Yeah. And it's Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen. It's really good. Is it? It's a great show. That's interesting. So is it, is it a pervy show? Is it Kinda like a. well, there's a lot of scientific about their socks. Yeah. Well yeah, they totally are. But it's a new field at this point. Nobody has thought to investigate like sexual response. So they are the first people to detail what happens when you have an orgasm. They're the first people to try and take measurements of female orgasm, like all these. Really nobody thought that that was legitimate research at the time. So he gets thrown out of multiple institutions. He's always getting

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       in trouble.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       It is pretty fascinating. We think about it. It wasn't until the 20th century that people started researching stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:32:45       Oh. And sexuality. And even then it was all men, like nobody gave a shit about a female response. That was totally secondary. Like because this is what happens. This is another little feminist. I'm a soapbox. Is that feminist though? I have an issue with the term feminism. I know it's kind of like, it's the term feminism. All it really means is that I support equal rights for women. You know? So in that sense of the term, yes, I'm very much a feminist, but so were you. So it was probably everybody in this room and of the people listening for sure. And so this is the thing when you don't have female physicians and you don't have female researchers because the institutions don't allow them, then you don't have a female research perspective. So all of the sudden all of your research subjects are men because nobody thinks that it matters to research what happens to a woman's body.

Speaker 2:          00:33:35       And it took decades for research on female sexual response to catch up to research on male sexual response, which is crazy because females are the child bears. Yeah. It's pretty bizarre. I know. We're pretty bizarre when you think about all the different things that used to be used on women, like the women used to go to a doctor to get manually manipulated to orgasm because they were like suffering from hysteria, hysteria, hysterectomy, hysteria. They all connected. Like that was the idea. And you know, in women who would go to hospitals for exhaustion, that was like a common thing to Austin. She's hospitalized for exhaustion, which is celebrities still do that. Precious. They say, yeah, they say that, but it's like it's either depression or substance abuse. Right. That's what they used to call them, exhaustion and it was only women, wasn't men that were going to do it sometimes too, but it was very common for housewives to go in for exhaustion. Wow. What they do to. I'm just check them off, just they might've. They might have and they probably gave him like early versions of psychiatric medications and they basically let them leave whatever stressful environment they weren't. Get away from the babies that were making you depressed. Get away from the husband, go be on your own for a bit. Read a fucking book. Do you think it's fair to think that

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       as life becomes easier and as a society and civilization is more like goods are more accessible? It's easier to get food. It's easier to get water. It's easy to get services and then slowly but surely things sort of equalized in terms of the more aggressive sex males paying more attention to the needs of the female. But in the old days when things were much harsher, people lived less that they have a shorter lifespan. The world was a darker place than it was more sexist. Do you think it was more like men were just like, look, this is, these are tough times. Fuck off bitch, you know, I'm going to get mine.

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       I think it's probably both. I think that there's definitely, you look at kind of maslow's hierarchy of needs you've ever studied

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       psychology, hospitalized for exhaustion make you look at maslow's hierarchy of needs and it's like this pyramid. It's like the food pyramid, but it's the needs pyramid and at the bottom are things like food and water and shelter. Like when you're concerned about food and water and shelter, you're not concerned about things like love and um, friendship. And then as you get to the top, it's things like self actualization and Blah Blah Blah. So I think that there is a component of yes, if you're just struggling to survive, contemplating or waxing philosophical about it, you know, civil liberties and things like that, it's not in your. So you may be very instinctual and you may be aggressive because of that or for whatever reason you may see kind of patriarchal lines that are drawn in the sand and some sexism and some violence. But I think on top of that, maybe that would always be the case.

Speaker 3:          00:36:34       So long as women didn't have a voice. I'm not sure. I'm not sure if just moving to the future and I'm not sure if it has a function, if it's a function of people having more access to food and goods and services or if it's really a function of women. Because what happened was women were mothers and men said, okay, mothers bring life. This is something that we should respect and we should honor. And this was a historical norm for a very long time. And then as you know, these kind of hunter gatherer societies moved into more agrarian societies and started to form cultural structures. Men realized I can overpower that bitch, like I have physical strength and I can physically put this woman in her place, and as they realized that there was a power differential between them, that men were physically stronger. I think that's where a lot of patriarchal wisdom comes from is that men are physically stronger than women.

Speaker 3:          00:37:29       Do you think that wasn't there was there was realized not until there was agriculture and until there was cities and I think that that was a big part of it is when you think that that would be a big part of it everywhere. I mean all primitive cultures. Well if you are a hunter gatherer type and so you're living in a very small tribe and you're concerned about kinship or the welfare of your children, then I think that there's a certain amount of respect and honor that you are going to pay to your wife, but why does that go away with agriculture? Why does it go away with the city? It's not so much agriculture as it is. All of the things that come along with that agriculture, which is maybe political power, which is starting to stratify and have jobs and, and it no longer are you making your own clothes, making your own shoes, doing your own hunting, doing your own cooking. All of a sudden now you're a cobbler and you're a butcher and you're whatever. And so people have to depend on one another for goods and services and they have to say, okay, I'll trade you this for that. And then money comes into play and bartering and all of a sudden, whereas it was a lot more egalitarian before where

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       everybody kind of had a strong role because they were taking care of themselves or they're very small groups. Their family groups. Now all of a sudden they have a place in society. And that's I think where you really start to see a subjection of women is because men start to develop power within societies. And if you look back historically, there are no known societies that were matriarchal societies, but you do see in smaller kind of tribal communities, more matriarchal, um, ideology more kind of honoring and worshiping of mother figures and mother gods. But every time there's a society, it becomes patriarchal historically, throughout every time. There's no such thing as those. Yeah, all of it. There is no such thing as those Amazonian women tribe that, you know, people talk about like the Amazonian women. That's your girlfriend. Yeah. And that's not a real thing, like women are going to take care of them.

Speaker 2:          00:39:29       It's a myth. It's a myth. So their vaginas. So, and I don't know, I can't say that that's a cause of it, but those things are highly correlated. But do you think that that evens out once civilization society becomes more complex and has. So my, my point was that scarcity makes people desperate and when people get desperate, they victimized not just women, but they've victimized week. Exactly one week. It's like you know who, who were the people that we historically look to for like heroic figures in times of great stress when people that pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and go out there and kick some fucking ass people with big muscles. So I mean that's the thing. It's, it's such a brutish and such an underdeveloped, a way to value strength, to only value strength in like I punch harder, right? Because there's other forms of strength, but you're right, when people are desperate, people know that, that, you know, think about if you're having an argument with another guy or if something comes to a head even at work, wherever, and you're having an argument and you can't agree with each other and you start to get more and more frustrated.

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       What's the way in every film, in every I'm a book. What's the way that it finally get settled? You roll up your sleeves and you get into a physical altercation with each other, which is just not a form of strength or not a form of, um, of settling a score that's common in like feet. In females it happens. Don't ever watch basketball wives. Yeah, it happens. They throw it out like the worst of the worst to. Not Normal. It's counterintuitive, but the best way to avoid that with men is martial arts. Get men in a situation where they train and they compete against each other on a regular basis. They don't have this need to dominate each other the way it's true because I do think that it's a bit stupid to to to just completely ignore the role that things like testosterone play in gender dimorphism like in female male differences in humans and and other higher order mammals like testosterone is

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       a is a chemical that actually is highly linked to things like aggression and feeling tension and having this need to release that in some way and we have less of it. We have significantly less of it and some women are more aggressive in. Some women are completely passive and are never aggressive that way, but there is a significant difference between males and females and testosterone is a big reason for that. So being able to get that aggression out, whether it's on a heavy bag or whether it's through martial arts or whatever exercises you use, I think it's irresponsible to think that that's not part of the equation.

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       Yeah, it definitely is for a man coming from a male point of view. I know it makes a significant difference with me whether or not I can release it or not, but it's also the just doing martial arts and being involved in something that gives you an understanding of what physical confrontation is really all about it. It doesn't. It's not this scary thing that every man has to like puff his chest up to avoid happening or. Or you go into it completely ignorantly thinking it's like a movie, like you're going to sock some guy and that's going to be the end of it and meanwhile you throw a punch at him and he moves his head and you're like, oh shit. This guy actually knows how to fight. Now I'm fucked because now I tried to hit somebody that is not going to let me hit them.

Speaker 1:          00:42:47       They're going gonna beat me up. A lot of that I think comes from fear and it comes from ignorance. It comes from other ridiculous, these media depictions of what happens when people hit each other. One the things that drives me fucking crazy and I really wanted to talk to you about this because I wanted to get into depression is a head trauma. Like there's so many God damn movies where someone hit someone in the head and they fall down, they get up and they rub their head and they were out cold and then they go out and they fucking have a crazy fistfight with 100 people or you know, they, they make it like they're back to normal. Like they get shut off and they come back to normal and that's fine.

Speaker 3:          00:43:20       Guy Is like, you know, this great martial artist is, is in a fight with like 10 other dudes. Right? And then he's like punching and kicking and then he does that thing where he headbutts like tons of like cracked his skull against the skull of like multiple people in a row. And it's like in no way affected by it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:37       Well, headbutts, it's really weird thing, but the way to do it correctly, it actually is effective because you're using this part of your head, your forehead, which is a really hard part and you smash them in the nose and your nose kind of gives in so crazy, but it works. It works like crazy. I wish we had a shot of redband just then when there's a great video of a woman knocking a guy out in a bar, this. There was some sort of a bar fight in this. This guy was involved in a fight with this woman's boyfriend and the guy grabs the woman and the woman grabs the guy shirts and slams him in the head right on his nose and the guy goes out cold and goes limp and it's hilarious because it's like this little woman and this big man and she knocks him out with her head.

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       Yeah, but that's that. They never showed that in the movie. They never hit him in the nose. They hit him like in the same part of their head. Yeah. You can't do that. Well you can. You're going to scramble your brain or Samoan if you're like one of those dudes with extra big head, you can get away with that, but for most people you smash him in the nose. I mean, you probably don't want to do that too much. We're even seeing that there are just a video. This watch. This girl had bought this dude. It's fucking hilarious because there's all this shit going on and this girl just grabs this dude and Kaos see if you can cut to it because it's kind of a long video. If I remember correctly. There's like a lot of shit going on. Big Bar fight. Oh, just isolate it because this is. Is he punching her? No, I think. Yeah. Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          00:45:07       Dude. That's insane.

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       Yeah. I don't know when in this video. I don't think this is the same video. I think this is a different one.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       Yeah. This isn't the same video. The other video was indoors. That one, that one's outdoors, but whatever. Um, yeah. Like even, you know, they're finding that soccer players, just the multiple, the movement of like hitting a ball with your head over and over and over and over and over causes mild concussive injuries. So yeah, cracking people in the skulls a lot is probably. Yeah, it's not really avoided. Well, you know, and me, I've obviously I come from this background of not just constantly doing that my whole life, but being around it my whole life I've been around so many guys getting hit in the head and I've seen them from the beginning of their career and then I see them at the end of the career and I see a significant decline in how they communicate and how I'm sure how they feel. They seem like old men when they're in their forties and depression is a real issue and it's one of the reasons why I wanted to bring this up is because my friend Mark Gordon, Dr Mark Gordon, who's an expert in traumatic brain injury and he works a lot with soldiers and athletes that have had significant brain trauma and they have a lot of issues with their hormones afterwards.

Speaker 1:          00:46:24       The pituitary gland is extremely sensitive and he wrote a piece connecting Robin Williams with depression, not just based on a lot of factors. I mean robin had a lot of things going on and he, he obviously had substance abuse issues. He obviously he had the Parkinson's issue which was also taking medication for Parkinson's, which has been connected to depression, but he also had heart surgery and his Dr Gordon's connection was that Robin Williams having had this major heart valve replacement, which entails many hours of anesthesia, lowered blood pressure and the literature speaks of post cardiac surgery, depression and over 100 publications and that the prolonged surgery with low blood pressure, they believe precipitates a perform a form of she hands syndrome, which is the loss of important brain hormones. Oh, interesting. Additionally, there is an increase in reverse t three and a decrease in t three, which can cause a relative hypothyroidism that's also associated with depression. And Mark Gordon wrote this whole piece about it and he's saying that what people have to consider more is like when you take someone into a situation where you're fixing their heart, you're, you're, uh, you also have to realize that there's gonna be some adverse effect. The whole body's gonna react to this. It's not just gonna be about, look, your heart's fixed, you know, why are you so sad? You know, hormones are fucking completely out of whack now. And that could have played a factor in this that was ignored.

Speaker 3:          00:47:54       Well, and that's something that I think that we've historically had this really weird approach to medicine, which I think is kind of a secondary effect of thinking scientifically. And obviously I, my background is in neuroscience. I worked as a scientist for many years and I am very much a scientific thinker and I'm all about the scientific method. But I think that we sometimes are at fault when we're a little bit too reductionistic and our views. And so if you look at the history of modern medicine, of evidence based medicine, what ends up happening is that we look at a problem and we try to fix the problem and we look at it as if you can somehow cut that piece of the person's physiology completely out of them, solve it, and then put it right back in. And it doesn't have any effect on anything else in their bodies.

Speaker 3:          00:48:44       I mean, you look at medication, right? Um, any, any form of pharmaceutical, they all have side effects. If you think about what a side effect is it, it comes down to how medication works of medicine is a molecule. It's some sort of molecule that fits in a receptor somewhere in your body. And the idea is that you want it to have really high efficacy. So let's say that I'm somebody who has a problem with blood pressure for example. Or actually let's just jump into depression because I've been talking about this a lot lately around Robin Williams. I had Paul Gil Martin on my podcast just last week to talk about that. He, he hosts the mental illness. Happy hour podcast and has really great insights into mental illness and I of course publicly have dealt with depression most of my life. I take medication every day. I go to therapy every week. I'm very open about it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:36       Isn't that for a lot of people, they would look at you, especially people that don't have any issues with depression. They look at you, obviously very intelligent, beautiful young. Why would you be depressed? Guys probably tripping over themselves trying to date you. You, you. You're obviously very successful in pursuing intellectual pursuits. Why would you be depressed? For a lot of people are like, why would a lot of people don't understand the difference between depression and sadness and they don't understand that depression is a biological illness. Know they don't think of it and they also don't think of it in terms of like people look at it in terms of like, well, you've got all these sums. Looks like you've got all this, these numbers. Look, there's all

Speaker 3:          00:50:13       that almost can can make it worse for certain people. I mean, you look at somebody like Robin Williams, he had so much going for him right? He was famous, he was loved, he had all this money. How could he be depressed? He didn't have the problems that you were I have and you know what? Then you have this extra layer of guilt. You have this extra layer of shame, this extra layer of why the fuck am I still depressed? No matter how much success I get, no matter how much money I make, no matter how much people write me letters and say that they love me and and whatever. I can't seem to beat this feeling inside of me. This constellation of symptoms because it's not coming from that. It's coming from your brain, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          00:50:53       I don't suffer from depression, but I have had many friends who do and I have always wondered what it's because it seems to be that when you go to a doctor and they start treating it with a treat it with medication or they try to adjust your diet and prescribe exercise first, that there's no like one simple fix and everybody's completely different.

Speaker 3:          00:51:14       We'll get people get upset about that because I think it goes back to, to kind of what I was talking about before, which is a meandering way to, to. Okay, so again, to go back to this idea of a drug, you take a drug, let's say I take an antidepressant. My antidepressants specifically is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, an Ssri that's called citalopram. That's the off brand. I think it's Selectsa, um, is the brand name I take that it binds to my serotonin receptors in my brain and it allows me to dump more Serotonin into the synopsis that the gap between two brain cells so that I always have more available. It basically tells my brain that I need more serotonin so I make more serotonin available to myself. It's a, it's a real uptake inhibitor. And so I'm sorry, it keeps more serotonin in, in the gap, um, instead of sucking it back into the cell.

Speaker 3:          00:52:05       So I always have more available to me now. It's a molecule. It's got a shape just like anything out there. It has geometry, so it binds to this specific receptor in the brain because it had got a similar shape to that. There are other things in your body that are similarly shaped and so what ends up happening is when you take a drug, the specificity of the drug is only based on whether or not the key fits in a locked somewhere in your body, but let's say that you had hundreds of thousands, millions of locks available to you and one key and you started going through. You'd be able to stick that in a bunch of locks. Some of them it might even turn, but it would fit in the lock of multiple locks hanging on that wall. So what ends up happening is I take this drug, it binds in my brain, it does what it's supposed to do in my brain, but it also may be does other shit like makes me really fucking tired or it makes it so I don't want to have sex as often.

Speaker 3:          00:52:58       It's a side effect and the reason that you have a side effect is because there's other parts of your body that the drug binds to. It's the same thing with medicine. Like you were saying, you operate on somebody heart. The heart is connected to other things. It's it, it's the source of blood flow throughout your body. It is connected to hormone levels. There's all sorts of things that can happen when you put somebody under under anesthesia, when you them open, when you, uh, you know, you, you cause an immune response and inflammatory response there your body is a holistic thing and so when you start jacking with certain things, other things are going to happen. That doesn't mean you should throw the baby out with the bathwater, but medicine is a risk benefit analysis always. But how do they find the. It seems to me that they find the right medication by experimentation that they try it.

Speaker 3:          00:53:53       And is that just the only way? It's because we don't have any test. I can't. You can't go up as a doctor. You can't come to me, stick a needle in my spinal cord, take out my cerebral spinal fluid and measure how much serotonin I have in it. I wish you could. I wish I could take some sort of a blood test or I could, you know, pee in a cup and then you could analyze that p and say you're low on Serotonin. You need an Ssri. That would be what works for you because other people's depression comes from problems with dopamine, comes from problems with norepinephrine or some combination thereof. But there's no test for it. It fucking sucks. There's no test for it. And so what ends up happening is you have to play a musical chairs. You try a drug. Maybe it was the first drug I tried for aunt, uh, when I decided to finally go on antidepressants, fucked me up so bad.

Speaker 3:          00:54:39       I took an n, d, R I a selective serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. I was so fucking depressed. I couldn't function. And we decided, let's throw the book at it. Let's take the drug of all drugs, the monster drug that does everything. And I couldn't sleep for a week. I felt like I was on straight up crank. Like on crystal. I quit smoking, I quit smoking. It was awesome. That's when I quit smoking. That's an important point. Terrible for your body. Horrible. Did you do anything to try to naturally stimulate your body to produce more serotonin? Did you try a lot of exercise? Did you adjust your diet but you didn't quit smoking? I did. I mean ultimately you've got on the drugs, didn't trust only on the drug for a week. So as soon as I got off the drug again, I immediately wanted to smoke again.

Speaker 3:          00:55:30       But at that point I'd push through it and I said, you know, I'm, I'm at my lowest. I was at my lowest point I've ever been at. So I was like, fuck, it can't get any worse. And I did. I quit smoking and it's been a couple of years. But I did, I tried. But the truth is, this is why addiction research is so important. This is why researchers go into the lab with a bunch of mice or whatever and they feed them a bunch of cocaine and they, you know, do these different kinds of experiments where you, you've heard of the famous experiment where you have the mouse in the cage and it's got a bar pressing paradigms that can push the bar. It gets coke and then like it just fucking does that until it dies. Like it. Like there's food right next to it and it's like, no, I want more coke, and then it just dies. And so the. Obviously there's something happening. This is a natural phenomenon because mice don't have value judgments. They're not thinking about this from a religious perspective. They're not saying, I don't know, maybe I should stop doing this coke and maybe exercise a little more and that'll give me the same kind of high. It overwhelms. It's

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       such a strong addiction. Nicotine have the same sort of addictive properties are more addictive. Nicotine is nicotine. Natural in the natural form is not like nicotine as far as like pipe smoke, nicotine is still addictive. Even if you're talking about like vaping it or something like that, and I'm talking about like the, like traditional methods of it, like the way they would smoke tobacco in a pipe or a cigar or something. It's not as addictive. I don't think it's as addictive, but it's still addictive. I mean it's still, it's the nicotine is the molecule that studied in laboratories. It's not the tar, it's not the shit that comes in the papers now. That's what has much more carcinogenic properties, but nicotine itself is highly addictive and that's the molecule that studied in research. It's pure nicotine. Nicotine itself. It doesn't actually have some medicinal benefits.

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       It does. It's actually neuroprotective so it can protect against Parkinson's. Wow. So if you smoke you won't get Parkinson's. Well, I wouldn't say that, but there is some evidence in the lab that animals that were given nicotine, um, had a lower incidence rate of Parkinson's. Is it, is it dangerous in the form that people take it as far as like gum or things along those lines as much less dangerous, but the goal still would be to get off of nicotine because the reason they're chewing the gum is because they're still addicted to it, but is there a way to take a small amount of it that gives you those neuroprotective properties but it's not dangerous? Possibly. I'm on, but I think it would be important for us to see more research to see how. How you know, again, it's a risk benefit analysis. Like is it really that beneficial?

Speaker 2:          00:57:56       I don't know. It's hard to say what's the dose response curve? How much would you have to take for it to be beneficial? The thing about depression that is fascinating to me is that there are some correlations between how well your life is going. Do you have relationships? Do you, are you happy with what you choose to do with your day? I had a friend who was a. He was on like some serious a SSRI and they changed his life. They got him. He, he quit his business. He quit his job, brother started his own business, got involved in relationship, and then once he got to a really good place, he slowly weaned himself off the antidepressants and now he's great. Yeah, and that happens to a lot of people and so I think that there's different. What we have to understand too is of course all psychiatric disorders or spectrum disorders, right?

Speaker 2:          00:58:39       There's really extreme examples and there's barely any examples and if anybody who's ever taken a psych course or who studied, you know, if you were a psych major in college, you know that as you've studied the dsm four, which is, it's called the diagnostic and statistical manual that they use in psychiatry and psychology. It's basically the big Bible of all the things you can be diagnosed with. The more you study it, the more you're like, I have that. Oh, I have that. Oh, it totally fucking have that. And you realize everybody has. Everybody can convince themselves that they have these. It's like web md. You know what I mean? So it's only once it is sufficient, lee, detrimental to your life, that it affects your relationships. It affects Your ability to work, it affects your health, whatever the case may be, and usually within the dsm there maybe like

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       eight things and it's like you have to have five out of these eight things and so anybody can read it and go, oh, I've felt depression before, but what they don't realize is there is a difference between depression and sadness. There's also a difference between parody depressIon, so depression that lasts years, decades, and the type of depression that people get that's directly linked to life events and that's your dog dies, you will a big one. You lose your freaking job. Like we've seen so many documentaries lately about this. As the economy took a downturn, people lose their job and then they ended up committing suicide because they can't. It's like this cascade of awfulness. That's a really common one. Um, you know, family member dies, you have a stillborn or you have an abortion or you how you have a baby, a healthy baby. Postpartum depression is incredibly common.

Speaker 3:          01:00:11       And in that case, that's much more common that people can take meds, they can do all these things, and once they get back to where they were before that horrible life event, they're okay to get off off the meds. Some people are able to get their depression managed without medication perfectly well, but some people aren't. Is the different reactions that different people have two different medication? IS it because their depression has a different source or is it just a biodiversity? I think it's more of a biodiversity thing than a source thing as sources. Hard to say. So depression is both. When you think about it. Well, brain and mind are the same thing in most modern neuroscientists say that brain and mind are two sides of the same coin. That mind is just an emergent property of brain. Nobody's a dualist anymore. They don't think that you can like heal the mind and it has no effect on the brain because it's the same fucking thing.

Speaker 3:          01:01:04       So there are some people's depression comes from the fact that their dopamine levels are, are not healthy or their norepinephrine levels are not healthy or whatever the fuck. But I think the, the common view of depression now is that there's some sort of biological difference in your brain and oftentimes that's either caused or it develops out of childhood or early life experiences where you know you have some sort of trauma or you have some sort of development. You have some sort of, you know, interaction with famiLy, whatever the case may be. And it doesn't have to be, you know, you were molested as a child. It can literally just be like you didn't feel loved or whatever the case may be. And you've got this brain difference combined with this emotional experience and what ends up happening. Because when you're very young, you're brain is very plastic.

Speaker 3:          01:02:00       So when you're very young, you're learning skills that are gonna last you the rest of your life and you're actually building your brain architecture. Certain neurons are connecting and disconnecting and reconnecting and pruning out the tree. The beautiful tree that is all of the cells in your brain is getting pruned when you're young and if you're depressed when you're young and you're experiencing those kinds of things, when you're, you're going to prune a tree that's prone to depression as you age because you're going to keep reinforcing those neuronal connections. That's why therapy is so important. Meds in and of themselves are never going to get you in a place where your depression is really well managed. It's going to get you in a place where therapy is going to be working better for you. Meds are going to be an immediate and necessary interventional strategy so that you're not crying or you're not trying to kill yourself or you're not.

Speaker 3:          01:02:49       Whatever your symptoms so you can actually fucking get out of bed to work on yourself. That's what meds are there for me. Meds keep me from staying in bed all day. That's not variable though. Finding the right counselor has got to be incredibly difficult. It's tough. It's like I always liken it to the women who are listening to the podcast. I liken it unto you when you were first deciding to go on birth control. a lot of women will go to their gynecologist when they're 15, 16, 17 and say, I want to go on birth control and they'll give them ortho try cycling or whatever the pill, the regular old pill, and they'll be fine. A lot of women will take the pill the first time and it will make them really sick. Like every time they take the pill it makes them want to throw up or it gives them cramps or something's weird about it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:30       It affects others and they go, oh, this drug doesn't work for me and go, oh fuck, okay, let's try one with lower levels of estrogen or progesterone, or let's try the ring or the depo provera shot, or maybe you need an iud. I was like that. It took me multiple times to find the right drug and I think it's the same thing with therapy. I think it's the same thing with psychiatric medicines. It's not, we're not monolithic, so the same combination isn't going to work for everybody and the truth is if that makes you afraid of modern medicine or if it makes you think that psychiatry is woo or something like that, it's the same thing as cancer in many ways. There's so many parallels. Cancer is not one disease. It's a spectrum of diseases. If I got diagnosed with breast cancer and you got diagnosed with breast cancer and we both went in with our diagnosis the same day, our oncologists would give us different treatments because we would have different genetic markers.

Speaker 3:          01:04:19       We would respond differently to different types of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy means chemical therapy. It's a really big umbrella term for all the different kinds of cancer treatments that are available. Maybe you would get more radiation. Maybe I would need surgery, but your metastasis would make it so that surgery wasn't a viable option. It's it's a spectrum. Disease and psychiatric illness or the same way. The variable though, the counselor has to be kind of weird. It is weird. It's weird. Find someone that you can confide in wholeheartedly and it takes time a really long time finding the correct sex, right. Whether or not some men will do better with women counselors. I have a male counselor. I'm like, I would never. It's funny, I have a male therapist, but I have a female gynecologists like I would never in a million years let a dude like put speculums and may and like dig around in my cervix, but I'm totally comfortable with a male therapist. I have a friend who went through a male gynecologist and the gynecologist texted her, asked her out. Oh

Speaker 3:          01:05:22       my gosh. She's kind of a flirt. She might've put it out there. It's crazy. There. Reminds me of what's the, um, jet appetite. What's the jed apatow movie while he was getting in there? Whenever you have obviously never had a path you would never know. I haven't, but some girls are dirty bitches. But what's the judd apatow movie with? Um, uh, knocked up, you know, and, and she goes to the doctor and it's her sister's doctor and he's all like, oh, I recognize your now. Like putting puts her in this. It's like so good. I couldn't do dig around your cooter. I could never. I just could never. I'm glad that I live. I'm glad it's 2014 and there are plenty of female. Ob gyn is available because back in the day you had a male guide. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       because they were only do doctors. Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. That would be really weird for a guy to have a woman doctor that's checking out your genitals. So would be odd as well. Would you have a female doctor before? Right? Like grab your balls while you cough that. Yeah, but that's the issue. Like the man would be the predator like that the doctor, the female doctor would have to deal with, especially if it's an attractive female doctor would have to deal with the dude being kind of excited about a woman checking out his balls. I'm not sure. Keep doing it. She found it. Yeah. That she'd probably have to deal with that a bit for fucking sure. Well, there's um, you know, I was talking to a friend of mount this, uh, the other day and he, uh, is pretty philosophical, older guy and he was um, he's been through two divorces and he was talking about how sex starved so many people are like, you're dealing with all these scenarios where you're like, oh, this guy was a creep and this, you know, this woman is ridiculous and there are people out there that no one's touching and they are so hungry just to be held.

Speaker 1:          01:07:10       and I mean this is a minor story, but when I was a, when I first came to California, I didn't have any friends, came here from New York and I wasn't happy. I wasn't happy because I didn't enjoy acting. I didn't enjoy being around actors and I didn't have any friends and it wasn't, didn't have a girlfriend, didn't have any dates. And I, I got a hug from this girl in a set and I'll never forget that feeling of that hug because it wasn't like a sexual hug. It was a friend gave me a hug and when she gave me the hug it was like my, my level One but not sexual. It was like love. Like I got, I got touched you. Gotta love boner. I got touched for the first time in like a couple weeks and I was like, oh, you need thIs. Like this is important for people.

Speaker 3:          01:07:56       It's totally important for people. There's all sorts of hormones like a cascade of hormones that you set off when you are affiliative when you're, you know, close to somebody else and it's absolutely necessary. And kind of going back to what we were talking about about aggression, like a male female difference. I also feel strongly that many men have a deep need that slightly different than than women that our sexual needs are much more affiliative and emotional and there is some physiological basis for female sexual need. Don't get me wrong, like any girl can tell you that she's had this craving, this, this passionate feeling where she's like, I just need to come or adjust, need to have sex with somebody. But with men, there's literally a backup of fluid that you have to release. That's a very different physiological thing than women. And again that goes back to testosterone. So the same thing as you were saying, mma can be really helpful for clearing the mind and for lowering your. Your base levels of aggression. I think coming does the same thing. I think it's healthy for guys to jerk off if they're not having a lot of sex because guys can get pent up and be aggressive because they're not coming up

Speaker 1:          01:09:15       well. They're also. You're desperate to. Yeah. I had a joke about it was. It was a whole descriptive called jerk off first. Then think about it like anything you're thinking about doing in live. Any weird decision you're gonna make. You're getting married. That's good. Jerk off first. Then think about, you know you're going to decide to do this, you're going to buy that car. Are you going to do this? You're going to buy those clothes. Jerk off first. And tell me if you really want to wear alligator shoes, what are you? Why are you wearing those? So you're trying to attract a certain person like

Speaker 3:          01:09:42       about the little head and people guys thinking with that head or whatever. There is a really big neurono link there. There are hormones that affect your dick the same way they affect your brain. And so you can't pretend again that your cock is somehow completely disconnected from your emotions, from your feelings. Well, if you at it,

Speaker 1:          01:10:03       and also if you looked at it objectively, if you looked at the human beings on this planet as like a giant mathematical equation, you would say, okay, why are there so fucking many of them? Well, because there's this intense need to breed and this intense need to breed was back when it was really difficult to stay alive. You know, we are essentially the same organism that used to get cut down by each other by animals, predators, natural illnesses, disease injuries.

Speaker 3:          01:10:29       We've only been around for 200,000 years in our, in our current form, homo sapiens as a species. So before 200,000 years ago, we're talking about something that was different enough from us, evolutionarily speaking, to be a different species. Homo sapiens, 200,000 years old, that's long enough for a little bit of evolution. Yes, we are. We have changed in some ways, but that's not long enough for that much evolution in many ways. Biologically, psychologically, evolutionarily speaking. You're right. We are the same organism. That was like crawling out of the trees.

Speaker 1:          01:11:02       Yeah, extremely primitive. And again, when you also talk about the biodiversity, there's some folks that are just more fucking primitive today, more animalistic or more kinetic and just

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       the range is so massive when we talk about what is quote normal and what is hyper and hypo. So many people are so different and that's why it's cool to see when people actually manage to partner up or whatever sexual or emotional partnerships make sense for them, whether they're monogamous or polygamous, whether they're um, you know, gay, straight, somewhere in between. It's so cool when you see people that make it work because they're on the same page when there are so many differences that exist out there. When two people go, you're awesome, or three or four, whatever. And they go, you're awesome. I'm into. You were into the same stuff. We abide by the same rules. We have the same sexual proclivities and it works like how fucking cool is that because there's so many combinations out there. When those magnet, those two ends of the magnet kind of find each other in that way, it's.

Speaker 3:          01:12:13       It's pretty dope. Like it's not that common. Well, even like when you were talking earlier about molecules and receptors, it's almost like you have to have the right fit. Yeah, you totally do. You also have to be a good molecule. It's like how many people truly have their shit together to the point where anybody would want to be with them and so many people are so god damn codependent and so fucked up. Then they laid can attract anyone because their own biology, their psychology though, the mix that makes them a person, it's just so chaotic that you can't expect to be happy in a relationship because you're not happy alone. Yeah. There has to be equity in a relationship, like you can't suck the light. You can't be like a vampire and a relationship. You have to offer somebody just as much as you get from them and you have to be, like you said, very standalone.

Speaker 3:          01:12:56       I mean that's a common theme for me in therapy is this conversation about if I am in a relationship, feeling very confident and comfortable because I have like an insane fear of commitment. I because I'm so used to thinking about our relationship as if it's a I'm a prison sentence and I've been really relearning what it means to be in a relationship with my therapist and how the idea of living for now is a healthier way to look at life. Like I don't have to think about hardcore future kinds of conversations. Like if I'm comfortable with myself right now and I can be comfortable with a partner right now and not have all this like sense of intense obligation. That's where that codependent stuff comes from and that's what I think is so incredibly unhealthy in a relationship. It's like I'm going to bring my best self to the table and hopefully I'll find a partner that does the same thing instead of needing a partner, which is a common motivation for people to get in relationships. I need somebody else. I can't handle it on my own. Well then you're not going to end up working it out. There's all those variables to like the sexual variable, the emotional variable.

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       There's so many different things that are going on and then it's almost like, okay, I found this waterhole. I can't leave. I finally found water. I was alone like my experience of going several weeks without being hugged and then being hugged and like, oh, and that was just a friend. It was someone on the set. The difference between that and someone who's gone years without a relationship that really worked and you finally have one that works and you fuck it up [inaudible] you too. God damn clingy and too crazy. Where are you? Where are you? Why aren't you home? I'm texting you, why aren't you texting me back immediately? That kind of shit is what makes me run out the door. That's what I'm talking about when I talk about my quote unquote fear of commitment. What it really is is it's an intense feeling of stress when I feel obligated to somebody else, so, so in the healthiest relationships I've been in there, the relationships where there's not a lot of jealousy, not a lot of possession, not a lot of that checking in and it's just trust.

Speaker 2:          01:15:08       You trust each other and when you're really into somebody, you want to be around them and you spend time with them, but when you want to be around your friends, they're not like, where are you? Why aren't you checking in? When are you coming home? It's like, fuck off dude. Like I don't want to be with you. If it's going to be like this, there are friends like that and they're brutal and you got to cut them off. Yeah, you do because that's. That's that codependency and what happens when you end up with two people were like that with each other and they less and less learn how to exist on their own, so then when they finally do break it off because it's obviously unhealthy, then they're fucked. Then it takes all this healing to get back to a place where they're independent again.

Speaker 2:          01:15:43       Yeah. That's so true. And iT's. It's a weird thing when you find those two people that like, they can't be a part. Like they literally, they don't go everywhere together. They roast like nobody wants to be around them. They're the worst friends like that, don't you? I cut off all my friends. oh, you have no friend. I'm your friend. fuck face. What are you talking about? I mean all my shit friends. Oh, you're shit for it. That's good. cutting off shit. Friends is just. Me and my girl were out there riding motorcycles. Well, I think the older you get, you just realized why my friends with these people. That happens to. That's true. When you're younger you need a lot of support and I think the older you get the more you value your alone time and the more you realize that good relationships and good friendship shouldn't feel like work and once they start to feel like work you're like, fuck, I have too many obligations and responsibilities.

Speaker 2:          01:16:36       I don't want to have to work to be friends with you. Also I have a lot of friends that are like super empowering. Like when I'm around them I want to do better. I want to be better. I get stimulated, you know, I think better my mind functioning like I'm inspired. I'm very lucky to have that. Now. You know, you were talking about your experience when you first came to los angeles and not having a lot of friends and kind of being depressed and so when I first moved to la I was in New York. I'm usually not that comfortable talking about this, but for some reason I'm going through right now. I was living in New York and I was working on my phd and then I started dating

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       bill maher. Like that's why I came to los angeles is because we started dating, I was living in New York. I would kind of come and go and see him and we weren't committed to each other. I had a life on the west or on the east coast. He had his life here on the west coast and eventually we got close enough that we decided, hey, let's give this thing a go. And so I was like, fuck it. I was actually really not happy in my degree program. so in some ways it was a double whammy. I was very happy to be exploring a deeper relationship with this guy that I'd grown to love and also I was more and more not happy with my situation in New York and so it was a new opportunity. I moved out to la and we ultimately ended up dating very seriously for about three years and that was my, my first la experience was bizarre as fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:17:58       I was dating somebody who was incredibly famous in the public eye who had a lot of money. There was a big equity problem in the relationship. I didn't know what I was going to do with my life. I had just left my degree program. I was searching for answers and I was young. I was 24, um, but I had no friends, none. I mean I was friends with people in their fifties, like that's, that was my social circle and yeah, I would meet people like I would hang out with sarah silverman, a little bitter, but they weren't really my friends. I was the come along. I was the girlfriend and there were all very nice to me and I was like, what a weird life, but it was almost like I was living somebody else's life and I was pretty depressed and I was very lucky to have my best friend at the time, kelly was still living in dallas where I grew up and I'm kind of worked with her and hooked her up with a job.

Speaker 3:          01:18:47       Working with bill. She ended up becoming his wardrobe stylist and she still does that to this day, which is really amazing. It was a huge opportunity for her. She always wanted to come to la. So. And now she's this incredible celebrity stylist and has this great job. And, and um, so I was very lucky when she first came out maybe six months later because we got an apartment together and I finally had somebody, but I just had her and it took probably until just a couple of years ago. So now that's maybe been five years out before I met this group of friends that we affectionately call each other. The nerd brigade. Yeah. We hashtag nerd brigade on twitter all the time and they're like, one of my best friends just finished her phd in molecular neuroscience from caltech. One of my other best friends got his phd from usc in animal cognition.

Speaker 3:          01:19:33       I have a friend who, another neuroscience student at caltech. I have a friend who, um, has a marine biology degree. they're all like science communicators, writers, academics, but cool young, edgy, fun people who like, we get each other, we're friends because we have a lot in common. It took a long time to get close to these people and to meet them and to finally. Because la is a fucking hard city. If you're used to living in a university town like there, it's so hard to you in. Well first I was in denton, Texas. That's where I did my undergrad and my master's at the university of north Texas. And then yeah, I was in New York city but I was living in queens specifically in forest hills because I would take the bus to flushing every day to um, to queens college. That's where I was working on mY phd at the city, university of New York graduate center.

Speaker 3:          01:20:26       But queens college was my campus. And um, a lot of my friends live in pasedena still, which is very much a college town because their cow, they were caltech students and now they're working there or, or some of them are still taking courses. But I saw, I mean brian just shook his head like la, it's hard to meet smart people in this city. It's so full of fucking vapid people and people who will. I learned this quickly. I moved to la dating somebody who was like an a list celebrity and all of a sudden I was like, wait, why do you want to be friends with me? Wait, what's going on? I also date I dated another very, very famous person in my life where I don't, I don't publicly talk about that relationship at all just to respect each other's privacy. But I wouLd learn things about people.

Speaker 3:          01:21:10       Like I had this one group of friends who I thought were my friends, um, and I remember dating this person and being like, hey, do you want to come to a barbecue? I don't know. Oh, but you know, so and so thought that you might want to play tennis. We're going to do it at so and so's house. Oh, so and so we'll be there. Oh yeah. I'm totally down. And you would get that all the time. This like, oh, is that why you're friends with me? Thing is very bizarre. It's such a weird experience that I think a lot of people don't. I never even imagined. But it also has opened a million doors for me. Like how the fuck you think when I was 23 years old, you know, cutting up mice or birds and digging around in their brains. See, I always thought I was going to be a bench scientist and that's what I was going to do and I kind of hated it.

Speaker 3:          01:21:55       I loved teaching, kind of hated doing the lab work, but I was like, okay, this is the path I'm on and this is who the fuck. If somebody had told me, oh, you're going to be in media, you're going to be on the joe rogan podcast, you're going to start your own podcast. You're going to be on television. I'd be like, you're fucking out of your mind. Like I'm scared of camp. When I was in Texas at 16, I tried out for season two of american idol. You sing? Yeah. I was a jazz singer and qa. Yeah. And so I made it through for callbacks and season two american idol. I made it through the producers, the executive producers more. ExActly. I finally got to the three judges. Who were they? The main ones? It was like randy and paula and simon cow. And um, so that was the last audition you do before you have the book.

Speaker 3:          01:22:38       Right. And you know why I didn't get it. All three of them said like, you're not, they go, we'd like your voice. We like your look because I was a total punk rock kid. I had short spiky hair and my lip ring and the arm is very avril levine, kind of a look back then. And they were like, oh, we love it all your, you're the total package. And I was like, great. And then I auditioned and they were like, you're not going through. No, but why? And they were like, you are not tv ready. I was so afraid of the cameras. I like didn't have that dynamic personality that all of the reality tv stars have where they're like, I'm going to win this competition because I'm the best. I just walked up and I was like, are you ready for me to say I'm so scared?

Speaker 3:          01:23:14       Like it was I, I was weak. I didn't have that, that kind of self assertive thing going on to develop that. I think I did. I think it happened from getting thrown into it. I think what happens is when you're like, okay, I'm just working. I met him in the lab also. I taught between then and now I've taught like a million courses so that helps you stand up in front of a classroom and you go, you don't understand glycolysis, we're going to figure this out together, up on the whiteboard and you're helping the students. So that helps with your confidence for sure. But also I think getting thrown into it. I come to la and it's like, oh, let's go to the emmys. Let's walk this red carpet, let's do all. And then you know, you're all the sudden in the room with all these really important people and you don't even know who they are.

Speaker 3:          01:23:56       Like I would go to parties where every single person there was a celebrity and the people you didn't recognize, you didn't recognize because they owned movie studios. Like it's the weirdest feeling and then once you realize I'm not that different from these people, I can have a conversation with them like anyone else and I would talk about science, I'd be like, science is awesome. Let me tell you this story. And they'd go, oh, that's kInd of interesting. And then eventually bill was like, you need to be doing this on television, you need to be trying this at least because I think you'd be good at it. He completely and utterly pushed me into this and I thank him everyday for it because I never would have done it without his help. When the depression started when I was a child. So you were dealing with it your whole lot?

Speaker 3:          01:24:36       My whole life. Oh completely. Some of those years, like when I was dating bill or when I would be moving, those were some of the worst years because it was so stressful because he didn't have friends because I was unmedicated unmedicated then. Yeah. I didn't start taking medication until about three years ago. About 27. Did you try other methods to try? I tried some things and I, I've been in therapy my whole life. My parents first put me in therapy when they first started to decide that they were thinking about getting a divorce and I was a young man. I was maybe six or seven, so from the time I remember I've understood the therapeutic process and they always really promoted that in me. so then even after the divorce and the re marriages and all of that, I started doing the, the, the therapy thing on my own.

Speaker 3:          01:25:18       Then when I went to college and I was very much on my own, I went to college when I was 16, by the way. I've lived on my own at 60. I was fucking weird kid. Yeah, so I was a little. I'm an adult, but I wasn't. I did that. I went to therapy. I did all those things by myself, but I always had this mental block. I always had this like, oh, I don't need meds. meds means you're really crazy. Meds means you really don't have control and not until I kind of hit a very bad rock bottom a few, maybe three years ago did I finally say, you know what? Fuck it. I've, I think I actUally have to do this. I think it would be good for me. And then it was the same experience that I've heard over and over and over from people were finally they get on the meds that are right for them and they calibrate to their dosage and maybe they've been on it for about two months and they just have this epiphany of like, why the fuck did I wait so long?

Speaker 3:          01:26:05       I could have felt like this my whole life. What the fuck was I thinking? Because you're so societaly, we're so resistant to looking at mental illness the same way we look at physical illness where, so it's so easy. Uh, paul gil martin just made this point when he was on my podcast last week. If you went up to somebody with diabetes type one diabetes and you were like, what the fuck dude, why don't you just think more positively so that your pancreas makes insulin? Like what? What's wrong with you? Why can't you just make more insulin? It's like they'd be like, what are you talking about? It's the same thing with depression. People put the onus on you like they, they look at it like it's a disease of will, but it's not. It's a, it's a biological illness and that's just very hard for people to understand and so what you end up doing is carrying around a lot of guilt and shame and a lot of feelings like, I'm not good enough. I can't will myself out of this if I just think more positively. It's not about that, and I did that for years, years. You just deal with it and I destroyed so many relationships.

Speaker 1:          01:27:12       Wow. yeah. I can only imagine. I can only imagine being trapped in that scenario, but I'm. I'm also very sensitive to the variables that different people go through with their bodies. I have hypothyroidism. I have to take thyroid medication. It runs in my family, my mother has it too, and I know I used to get headaches, these weird headaches at the end of the day where I was like, oh fuck, like I could fall asleep. And it wasn't like, it wasn't like I was like, now I get tired, I go to sleep, but it was like I could fall asleep just watching tv and be out for like an hour. So it didn't make any sense. It was like a weird tired, like I was in pain, so, uh, and I get these weird headaches. And then once I finally got on medication I was like, whoa,

Speaker 3:          01:27:57       yeah, right. you're like, oh, this is, this is what other people feel like, like I thought I was normal because that's another thing. There's such a stigma in this country, not just about mental illness but about any sort of illness where people can't openly freely talk about it. So you end up living in this weird bubble where you don't really like, I know people that have mental illness that didn't even realize they had mental illness until they finally had a conversation with a doctor about it and they were like, oh, this isn't normal. Like everybody doesn't hear voices or everybody doesn't. It's like, yeah, because you're so afraid to talk to somebody about it. So that's, I mean that's a really important part of this I think is just getting past the stigma. That's why when something like this with robin williams, which is so fucking depressing happens a lot of people rally around it and they say, hey, maybe we can use this as a teaching moment because this guy, no matter how good his life was, he had this thing that he ultimately couldn't kick and it wasn't his fault. It just

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       is that way sometimes. And hey, maybe you have it too. I think in some ways it's good when high functioning People come out and talk about their illnesses because then people who are actually experiencing things like loss of employment, loss of a loved one, whatever, or who have had a bad go of it for other reasons or like even you, like you had said before, like even you, but you're pretty or, but you're successful, you're whatever. Well, if you could have that, then of course it's not weird that I have, you know, it's like it's a good thing for people to be able to see that they're not alone like that. And also there's a bunch of people that attribute other people's depression really irresponsibly to a bunch of different things. Oh yeah. I had gotten the podcast last week that was saying that robin williams killed himself because his wife's ex wives took all his money as if he knows it all.

Speaker 2:          01:29:56       It's like, oh, I'm so glAd you're such an expert and I'm not saying that it was a women's addiction to free stuff that was loose. It was so horrible and it makes you want to be like, who the fuck are you to presume that you know what's happening in somebody else's head ever? Not only that, it's insanely you're responsible to go against the grain of science and medicine, which is clearly established that it's an illness. It's an illness. Yeah, and I think that that's something too that a lot of people don't understand the same way. We're so comfortable with concepts of diagnosis and cure because we're so used to things like flu cold, um, you know, tonsil infection, whatever, where you take an antibiotic or you take an antiviral or you just wait in your immune system clears the disease. We're used to catching things and then eliminating them.

Speaker 2:          01:30:45       But when you have disease states that are processed, states like cancer, like diabetes, like mental illness, there's no cure per se. like I even, I got a tweet just earlier today from somebody who is like, blah, blah, blah. Have you ever thought about blah, blah, blah to cure your depression? It's like, I'm not cured of depression because I take attallah pram, I'm in treatment puts. I'll be in treatment the rest of my life. Do you believe as a person who's a neuroscientist, is it possible that they could eventually come up with something that balances your brain out instead of just adding something to your neurochemistry, which sort of enhances your serotonin levels, but rather something that where they can get it at a genetic level? I hope so. I mean, I really hope so. We're starting to see major improvements in cancer biology with personal genomic medicine. My fear with genomic medicine is only not to put a dark cloud on it because I think that it has like amazing prospects. My fear is that it's going to further increase the kind of class divide where you've got people who are sick because sickness strikes rich and poor the same, but for some reason we are a very class based system

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       and I think that you're going to see that rich people get those kinds of treatments and poor people don't and that that kind of stuff

Speaker 1:          01:32:06       scares me. That worries me. It always is with anything emerging technologies. Remember in the old days, the wall street phone, remember that wall street movie where Michael Douglas epic fucking stupid phone and that was like a huge status symbol. Rappers used to happen videos, most people couldn't afford a phone. Now I, I go to Brazil all the time for the ufc and I've gone to these poor neighborhoods. You see people on cell phones.

Speaker 3:          01:32:26       Oh, you see it in, in african nations were there aren't, there isn't enough malaria medication, but I mean there's this huge malaria, um, push right now to increase awareness and you know, you can get mosquito nets, you can do malaria tests on your family and you do it all through your cell phone because it's very common for people to have cell cell service or maybe not service, but to have access to a cell phone because the technology is getting cheaper and cheaper. So yes, I do think that time always tells and that hopefully eventually that kind of stuff trickles down. but I wish it didn't have to trickle down. I wish medication. I wish health and wellness, we're a more egalitarian enterprise that one of the biggest problems I think with the structure of american government and being such a capitalist society, which I'm all about capitalism, don't get me wrong, I think we need to be a socialist capitalist blend just like we are. Um, we have a lot of socialist systems in our country. The male, the socialist educate, public education is socialist. We have a lot of capitalist systems in this country. I hate that healthcare is a for profit system in America. It makes no sense to me.

Speaker 1:          01:33:33       The argument is obviously the people who work harder or more ambitious become better at it, should be rewarded for that. And that's what's going to motivate them to work harder and be the best heart surgeon to be the best brain doctor to be the best. You know, the guy who fixes.

Speaker 3:          01:33:47       I just feel like by the time you're a brain surgeon and you're licensed brain surgeon, you're a fucking good brain surgeon like you. You don't get through a 10 year residency. You get your surgical degree and then you have a 10 year residency before you become a neurosurgeon. You don't get through that and you're like a sub par neurosurgeon. You're, you're a fucking incredible neurosurgeons. they're the best of the best, the best of the best. And if those people want to do private practice on top of it, that's fine, but we have a practice on top of the socialized medicine. There has to be a national health service. Has to be. I agree with that. Here's the problem. Here's the problem. Fundamentally and I, it's very. If you can provide me an argument that solves this problem for a capitalist healthcare system, then I'm all about too, and I don't mean you, but I mean anybody listening, I'm all about hearing it.

Speaker 3:          01:34:34       The problem is that when you have a capitalist system that's a competition based system for profit, what ends up happening is that people compete. That's how it works, right? You compete in, a lot of times they say that's what drives prices down, is that you compete and prices get better and then you've, you know, the best part, whatever. Um, but what ends up happening when you have for profit healthcare is that illness is incentivized. Wellness is not. People make more money. The sicker you get, people make more money. The more procedures you have to get. People make more money, the longer you stay in the hospital and the minute. I'm not saying there's some grand conspiracy to keep people sick, but if you've got an industry like the insurance and pharmaceutical and for profit hospital industry where the profit comes from sickness, where is the incentive to get people?

Speaker 3:          01:35:33       Well, I'm not saying that doctors aren't very noble people. They are and they work every day. DoctorS, nurses, other healthcare officials to get people better. But the system in itself does not incentivize wellness. It incentivizes sickness. So at that very basic level, it's a bit broken because somewhere along that chain people are gonna take advantage. They're going to say, oh, I make more money if this guy has to stay in the hospital an extra day or I make more money if this guy has to get this quote unquote unnecessary procedure all the way across the board. The sicker you are, the more money goes into the system and that's really gross. It's gross. There are certain things that capitalism don't work on and I think that wellness, which is a basic human right, is one of those things. It just doesn't make sense. it's fundamentally incompatible with that type of monetary system, but isn't that just taking into account only people that do the wrong thing, but people who do the right thing, who motivate themselves to become the best orthopedic surgeon and treat the lakers and fix all their knee issues and these people rise to the occasion, shouldn't they be rewarded totally.

Speaker 3:          01:36:47       And the turd in the pool is not the surgeon. Trust me, it's the insurance company. It's the pharmaceutical company. It's this. Occasionally the surgeon. I have a friend who was my friend rob when he was young, worked at a resort and he. He clearly remembers these doctors bragging about how they talked to some guy into getting a surgery and because of these buying a porsche. Yeah, no, there is that. oh, for sure. So, so the fact that it even trickles down to the people who took a hippocratic oath to the people who we think of as being the most noble of the most noble of citizens in this country, if it even trickles down to them, how is it going to affect somebody who's pushing paper at the insurance company where you're just a number on a piece of paper, you're just a statistic and you're a bottom line is the answer to cut out that aspect of it, that the insurance company is the, the the issue and that really socialized medicine would be compensating the doctors and the doctors would still be potentially able to rise.

Speaker 3:          01:37:46       That would be my answer is the same. I think as any other industrialized western nation. We're the only industrialized western nation that doesn't have national healthcare, so what ends up happening is you have a public option. You have the option to have a healthcare system that is free and available to you and it has basic levels of treatment and care for anything that could go wrong with you and their doctors. You can see in their hospitals. You can go to if you want to go private. It's the same way that we have education in this country. I had an amazing public education. I have friends who went to private school. Their parents wanted them to go to private school. Good for them. They may have had a better education than me. They may not have because there were still amazing teachers available and an incredible infrastructure in place for me to get an incredible education as a student in the right spot or you can be in the la unified school system and have fucking horrible education that that is a problem with gentrification and with segregation and with again, I think some of the problems of our capitalist society.

Speaker 3:          01:38:51       While it's certainly a problem in how we view and what you know, what we think about in terms of where our money should go. LIke if we had. We had privatized police force and privatized fire. Like every time your house was on fire, you had to pay someone to come in and fix the issue and put the fire out. Like, my god, it's happened before it's happened there. Yeah. You can find stories online of people living in, in regions where they have like a privatized, um, fire service, like it's a, a four pay fire service and like people's houses have burned down because they can't afford to put it out a weird area. Like some, like some rural area. Exactly. And imagine what that was an urban issue with healthcare. I mean healthcare. You can be in the biggest, most populated city in the world and there's poor people that don't have healthcare.

Speaker 3:          01:39:38       Yeah. I think that if society is going to offer basic services, police force and fire for fire departments, medicine has got to be wanting to be one of them. And the thing is when you put the money into preventive care that's necessary, you end up saving so much money on the back end when people who can't afford to go to the doctor until they have a festering wound or until they've allowed the cancer to spread or whatever are going to the doctor early on and they're getting a checkup because they can afford it because it's free to them. When you've got somebody who's living on the street who obviously going to be subject to much more infection, much more disease because they just, they're living in squalor. If they can go to the doctor on a regular basis and get a checkup, they're not going to be then going to the doctor later to get some multi thousand dollar procedure.

Speaker 3:          01:40:30       That hippocratic oath, they have to do this. If somebody goes into and they're like, fucking arm is hanging off, no doctor is going to be like, I can't reattach your arm. You're just going to die. They're going to do it. They're going to build these people and they're never gonna fucking pay their bills because they can't afford to and then you and I are going to absorb that cost in our. In the money that we're paying for our insurance. Go back when you're talking about people living in squalor. That goes back to the mental illness issue as well because

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       he definitely massive percent of those people that are wandering around homeless. They're such an important point to make, but that was the gun. Damn. Ronald reagan administration, they changed the standards. They let loose, I remember it, I was a kid and I remember being in New York and seeing all these fucking people wandering. I came to New York for a martial arts tournament during the reagan administration and I remember like people were talking and I was young. I was a teenager and these adults were talking about these that all of a sudden they changed the mental health standards and they were releasing all these people and I was like, what? LIke they're just releasing them. They were taking these people that were in mental institutions. They changed the standards of what you needed to to keep these people in these facilities and they were just released them on the streets and influx.

Speaker 2:          01:41:38       There were two massive releases. There was one in the fifties when held all first came on the market, which is an anti psychotic, which was a major improvement and psychiatric care. So all of a sudden you had people who were schizophrenic, who had delusional kind of disorders and you can treat them. And so these people who were like basically just being fed and watered and asylums were given how doll and they could lead functional lives again. So there you saw a big change in the way that mental health services happened. You, you no longer had the asylum population and then you started having more of this idea of like a mental health facility. And then again, during the reagan administration used, you saw a big release. The problem there was, it was, it was really a name only. They weren't getting any better treatment. They were just put out on the street, change the standard.

Speaker 2:          01:42:23       Exactly. And so you've got these people that are put out on the street and it's, it's again, that there's, don't get me wrong, I, I mean, look at me like I, like I said, I moved out when I was fucking 16. I busted my ass my whole life to like work really hard. I got a good education. Um, I, you know, even coming to la with bill, he opened a bunch of doors for me. I fucking walk through those doors. I made sure that I was as responsible as possible. I am all about fiscal and personal responsibility. I have amazing credit, I have no debt. Um, but I also know that as a nation we're only as strong as the weakest amongst us and there are certain people to whom those types of standards just can't apply because they're, they're ill will. It's a spectrum issue, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          01:43:11       I mean there's, there's so many variables that when, when people like to look at these issues and look at them in a black and white term, I'm a liberal. So I think this, I'm a conservative. So I think that. And that's really, you know, I have a lot of ideas that are very liberal and a lot of ideas that are fairly conservative too. There's a real issues with picking aside like that, especially when it comes to ideologies. It's just such a lazy way to think. You're not thinking, you're letting somebody else think for you. I get a lot of hate when I come on your podcast, but also when I go on the young turks, anytime I talk about gm foods or genetically modified crops in any way and because what ends up happening is people look at me and they go, oh, you're a liberal shill. They say, I'm a shell. They look at me and they say, okay,

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       you're a liberal, you're a progressive, you're left wing. Why do you have this super conservative ideology when it comes to gm foods? Why would you say that you thInk that's a good thing? You must be pro big agribusiness. You must be pro monsanto and it's like, because I don't inform my politics based on what a party tells me, my politics are informed based on the science. I studied the science behind genetic modification and I come to a personal conclusion that genetic modification in and of itself is not only not dangerous, but can also be a huge boon. It can be really helpful for health and human safety across, especially in lower income and globalized areas where they're not very industrialized. Second problem is that people have a really hard time with the concept of sin touchy. This idea of, you know, that's a literary term for looking at the part for the whole or the whole for the part.

Speaker 3:          01:44:47       So people say gm food, monsanto, monsanto. It's the same thing. It's not the fucking same thing. That's a company that utilizes gm technology and yes, recently I got offered a branded entertainment job with monsanto and I had to turn it down and the reason I turned it down was not necessarily because I really disagree with the practices even though I do fucking disagree with their practices. Like let's be honest. There are a lot of monsanto things that make me mad. Social practices are but in the capitalist kind of prep, but. But the reason I had to turn down this brand to deal is because I knew that if I ever took a dime from a company like monsanto, my ability as a journalist to talk about gm crops from a very neutral perspective would be out the window. Nobody would ever take me seriously again.

Speaker 3:          01:45:31       So it's the same thing with big pharma. People go like a big pharma's evil, and it's like, so what should you never take drugs again? Are you out of your fucking mind? It's like you've got to be able to look at these things in a nuanced way and understand that there are problems and there are evils, but you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater and you can't say, oh, all modern medicine is terrible because pfizer is making money on the backs of poor people. It's like, yeaH, that's fucked up about pfizer, but that doesn't mean modern medicine is terrible. These are two totally different conversations.

Speaker 1:          01:46:04       AlSo people, when they start talking about genetically modified foods, one of the things that they have to take into consideration is that almost everything you eat is genetically modified and you go to the grocery store. If you're getting corn, if you're getting apples, if you're getting tomatoes, stop thinking that this just because it's organic, that it's not genetically modified. The corn that you eat today has no resemblance to the original corn.

Speaker 3:          01:46:25       None Whatsoever, and then they'll say, yeah, but it might not be transgenic. It likely is transgenic too, and that's another thing like genetic modification is a really big umbrella term. It could be selective breeding is genetic modification with a lot of people have a hard time with the concept of transgenic foods and I say to them, fine, if you don't want to eat transgenic, food's good. Define transgender. So transgenic foods would be a scientist going into the genome of an organism. Let's say it's a type of corn. They go into the genome and they go, okay, this corn tends to die readily. When the temperature gets above 101, well the climate is changing. It's getting hotter and hotter Where they farm it, so we're going to tinker with the genome and we're going to delete a gene or insert a gene or move the genes around in some way so that this corn is now drought resistant.

Speaker 3:          01:47:14       Change the genome, produce a new corn crop, and then continue to breed that corn crop and that is really the goal and generally the motivation behind gm crops. It's to make them withstand things like droughts or pests or whatever, so that they can live heartier and feed more people in that way. Now sometimes you have a company like monsanto doing their own research where they want to make a crop that can only live for one generation and then die so that farmers have to keep buying their seeds, for example, or they make a roundup ready crops. I want to crop so that I can spray the whole thing down. With roundup, the crop survives, but all of the weeds around it die. It's an easier way to farm, but it could have some really detrimental ecological effects, but for the most part, this is why a lot of scientists get pissed off about all the gm hysteria because they're like, okay, if I were to take this random corn crop and that random corn crop and breed them, I'm shuffling like 30,000 genes.

Speaker 3:          01:48:08       If I were to go in targeted and changed three genes that only affect the ability for it to withstand a higher temperature. It's a much more specific and targeted way to change this plant. I trust it more. I know exactly what I'm eating, but people are like, oh, it's horrifying because they're going in with, you know, pipetters and tools. Well, it's because of things like roundup because of companies that do mean there's a reason why people are suspicious is reason why people are cautious, they are worried about. And then there's been also some. There's been some fuckery involved in these studies too. Like there's a study about rats where they showed the grow, grew all these tumors in rats. They use more susceptible to tumors in the first place. it's not, it's, it's, you know, what, as somebody, as a person who has never studied lab science to try and make sense of all the bullshit in the media and, and, and to be reading articles that were written by journalists who have never studied lab on, how are you expected to keep things straight?

Speaker 3:          01:49:12       That's why I do what I do for a living. I'm a science communicator and my job is to look at research that exists and to try and translate that to the public. But I also want to try and understand where the public is coming from. Why are you afraid of this thing? Why does this thing worry you? Let's understand the psychological reasons behind it. LeT's understand what you've been fed your hold lives by the media and see what's reasonable and what's not and come to a rational conclusion about it. Unfortunately, we as a species respond better in some ways to fear and hysteria. We we see on the news that's like, holy shit, this thing could kill you, and you're like, oh my god, really? I need to know about this. Because if the media was always presenting things rationally like, okay, let's take a balanced approach to this. Let's look at the pros and the cons and people would tune out. It's not that interesting anymore. The things that we find salient are the things that raise the hairs on the backs of our necks and what that ends up breeding is, you know, is just a media landscape of fearmongering and screaming matches and worst case scenario conversations, which I don't think is very helpful for anybody.

Speaker 1:          01:50:20       It's also the reality of the absorption of information that people's ability to take in. How, I mean, how much time do you have in a day? People work eight plus hours a day plus commuting plus family, plus you have to be an expert about whatever they do for a living. I doN't know, contradicting information. You could always go online and find a host of websites that will tell you about the evils of genetically modified foods and if and if you absorb that information and you. That is what you preach, that's your mantra. Now. It's very difficult to be open minded and then sort of accept other ideas and try that, contradict those original ideas that you've been telling everybody about

Speaker 3:          01:50:55       and in. The truth is it's, it's, it's hard to figure out who to trust, especially in a landscape like this. That's why I never promote. I have no intention as a science communicator that the work that I do is going to necessarily promote a lot of people to go off and become scientists themselves. I mean hopefully young, young children or some Teens, people who are in that, in that age group and who are interested. Maybe there'll be influenced a little bit about some of the work that I do, but more more than that, I want to see a higher level of scientific literacy in this country. All that means is that we think more with our brains and less with our emotions and less with our, you know, that stephen colbert truthiness, like we got to get away from truthiness just because something feels right doesn't necessarily mean that it is right.

Speaker 3:          01:51:45       So it's like, stop for a minute, listen to the argument that's being made. Who is making the argument? Do they have any financial reason to be making the argument? Did they have any political reason to meet making the argument is this, is this article about gmos being evil on a website called, oh my god, gmos are evil.com or you know, and, and that's the thing. And I, I, and, and I think this also goes back to this conversation I had about throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The mainstream media has its problems, but journalism is an enterprise has a lot of nobility to it. The pharmaceutical company has major problems and it's very broken the insurance company too, but medicine has so much worth to it especially, you know, evidence based by biomedical advances. Psychiatric medicine has a lot of know pluses. The process of genetic modification is so important, but yes, monsanto has a lot of problems. We've got to be able to think more nuanced about these things and instead of going, well, I don't trust fox news, therefore I don't trust any media. Therefore I only am going to go to the site. Did that keeps, as you said, reinforcing what I already believe. Omg, gmos are horrible.com. That's the only place where I get my news. Well now you're in an echo chamber.

Speaker 1:          01:53:10       That's a huge issue and the other thing that you brought up there about political, about financial, all the different motivations, all the different things in the variables, that's also stuff that you have to try to pay attention to and squeeze into your head and that's the thing that it's impossible. We need someone like you to sort of break it down. Someone who has a background in this particular area to break it down in a way that we can understand what go. Okay, I'm comfortable. The santa maria is being honest with me about this particular aspect of depression and neurochemistry. He theSe are. This is her experience. This is also what she knows about the science behind it. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:53:43       I have no motivation otherwise. Nobody's paying me to say this and I think that this is why we, as you know, the listeners of the joe rogan experience, the listeners of talk nerdy with carrie, santa maria, the people who are really involved in the next movement of alternative and new media. It is our responsibility to continue to support these kinds of programs and to continue to speak up and become engaged and involved. Because if we're not happy with the way that traditional media is handling things because they're playing to the ratings and they're playing to the lowest common denominator, we can't be passive about it. We have to support the news outlets and the organizations and the podcasts and the web shows that that we support. We have to do our part to make sure that those things don't fail because the unfortunate thing is we don't have the backers that they have.

Speaker 3:          01:54:33       You know, I have a squarespace on my side. I have computer learning zone on my side. You have these wonderful, uh, sponsors on your side that help you keep doing this so that you can offer it for free to your listeners, but we're not being backed by pfizer, but we don't have four months and we don't have to meet with these other companies would find value in it and they know that we're going to say some crazy shit, but the only reason they're going to keep supporting us if is if people keep listening and if you raise them where people are going to keep listening because it's interesting. And the only reason why it's interesting is because we're being honest. Yes. And so that, that whole chain, like we're all in it together. I think that's the important thing is that like, we're here for you, you're here for us.

Speaker 3:          01:55:12       And we're all on that same team to be that counterculture and to, to offer opinions. But also offer facts that are, that are based in evidence that are based in reason, that aren't based in some sort of corporate interest or because some producer is in that fucking thing in my ear telling me that I have to do or say or act like somebody that I'm not. I would love to talk to you about this to the end of time. I would love to not tell you that you're already past the time you were supposed to leave. You know what's so funny too is the reason I have to leave and I'm so sorry you guys is because I have therapy therapy at three

Speaker 2:          01:55:43       and I've got to make it all the way across town to see my therapist at anytime you want to do this, I'm more than happy to with you and I'm so happy you're doing your show. thank you so much for wearing my tee shirt. I have to. Can I take a moment to plug? Is that okay? Because I just started making all this great merchandise and you can find it if you go brian to my main website just to care. Like if you go home, maybe click on home, then you can see that I've got all of my episodes right there. You can download them into the center. That was on a different page. it was an old episode that I did a talk nerdy to me, but there's, you know, you can see my episodes of the podcast right there. I use soundcloud, so it's through there.

Speaker 2:          01:56:21       And then if you scroll down you can see all of my merchandise there. I have t shirts and stickers and slap bracelets. This one just like that one. The old school microphone. I'm going to have a new style coming out soon and also I'm going to be offering soon hand made mugs from a really amazing potter friend of mine. So those will be really cool. Custom one of a kind. Mugs are made in a fucking factory in China by slaves, but they're beautiful. They're pretty cool. well it's Mike Maxwell, Mike Maxwell, the artist. I really like it. It's cool. And I get to take this home, right? Oh yeah. Fuck yeah. I've run jre cups now too, and if you guys want to buy them, they're available@higherprimate.com. Thank you very much, kara. Thank you for your podcast is awesome. I always love talking to you. It's just a. It's always just trying to catch up with your thought process and stuff it all in there, But I appreciate it very much. Thank you so much. Ladies and gentlemen, please check out our podcast. It's amazing character. Tweet me at carolina. Maria, out of her. Um, anything else before we go? You have anything going on? People need new t shirts. You fucking talk to the back of microphones. 40 t shirts@shopsquad.tv. Come into columbus, Ohio with tony and Tiffany Harris and all that
