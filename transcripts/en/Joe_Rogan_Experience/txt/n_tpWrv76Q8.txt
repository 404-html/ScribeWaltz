Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Four, three, two, boom.

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       What's up man? How are Ya? Hello. Thanks for being here. Well, I'm pleased to get here. It's a kind of a strange day in this part of strangers that every gets there. The big concern in Los Angeles has always been according to a firefighter that I've talked to. Once that the right wind catches a fire and it takes it all the way through Los Angeles, down to the coast. Well, it's not quite that. It didn't go through Hollywood. It didn't go. They think one day it's going to happen and with the right when they're not gonna be able to stop it, but she's just. Yeah, this was pretty bad. This is about as bad as I've ever seen in happen all in one day. Yeah. It was extraordinary. Driving down the road to get here. Just these huge, just huge pillowy. The. I thought it was just, you know, mountains and I thought it was a strange cloud formation, but it was just smoke smoke.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       Yeah. It looks like a giant gray mountain in the distance. Yeah, it's, it's insane how bad it's gotten. I've, I've had it happen three, this is the third time I've been evacuated since I've moved here 20 plus years ago. Wow. Yeah, it gets her off. But this is the roughest have ever seen. Jamie and I were doing the podcast yesterday and when it was over, I had like five text messages from friends that live in my neighborhood saying how bad it was. And then when we got home the wind was just crazy and it was just, it's just, it's humbling, you know, I mean, it's super unfortunate for all the people that are losing their homes and losing. They're losing their property. But the reality is this is um, it's nature. This is just something that you just can't avoid it. There's nothing you can do about it. It gets dry like this and I don't know what started it. I hope it wasn't a cigarette because that's the big concisely so many moron. So throwing cigarettes. It's not just a weather thing that just happens. It's, it is literally things like cigarettes and unfortunately a lot of the times it means the weather certainly accentuates it because it's dry and windy. And this is fire season. Well

Speaker 2:          00:02:10       anyway. Hey, thanks for being here man. He's incredibly comfortable. Chairs. They're not bad. Right? They're amazing because they support your back as well, which is a 47 year old man is helpful. So I'll keep bouncing away from the microphone, which I'm sure isn't good. But yeah, they're incredible. They keep you sitting straight to accentuate your posture. They do. There you go. So what's up man? What are you doing in town? Shoulders, back, chest out. They would be proud. There you go. I'm here. Yeah, I'm here doing a idea for a week. I've been A. I've got a show on Netflix that's come out, so I'm just kind of generally here to talk about it I guess. And uh, seeing a couple of friends and it's been a really nice, really nice week. Yeah, this is a good way to end it too with a giant fire and just saying get the fuck out of here quickly.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       These people are crazy living here with no water. Never rains. Yeah, it'll be. It's very different. Back home. It'll be. It'll. Yeah. It's uh, it's, it's, it's amazing. Just at this time of year, leaving England and coming to somewhere like, I mean, I'm sure, I'm sure you don't take it for granted, but you know, it's, it is amazing. Just for the weather and just for a bit you, would you like la as a, like as a place in our home and uh, does it, I mean, you've got an amazing sort of set up there. Is it just a, is it just a dream place to you?

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       It's a, it's a love hate relationship. Certainly the, the real problem is the population is just so insane. There's more than 20 million people. Plus who knows people, you know, how many. They really don't have no idea how many people have snuck in. You know, it's, it's just a chaotic place. There's no public transport. It just hit me that. No, there's no trains, there's no infrastructure. A, everyone's driving these huge. Everyone has an escalator or a tesla or something. Yeah. It's um, it's just a strange place. There's, the highways are massive. You know, you have five, six lanes on each side and they're jammed solid where nothing's moving either way. And if you can see it from there, really we realized how preposterous it is when you're flying into lax and you see the four, oh, five highway and the distance and it's all stopped for as long as you could see miles one way miles the other way. Just complete parking lot and just realize, wow, what are we doing here? Found a spot with great weather and you know, and then the entertainment industry draws people in. I don't know, maybe it's better to be in England to keep the rain a little bit, a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       She had like a little bit that I like, I do like a bit of the Ela, so anyway, I'll take a lot of pictures and it's very nice like when the rain clears and everything's sort of glistens and that's a nice. Yeah. Your instagram is interesting, you know, it's surprising. Well yeah, I mainly put, I paint and I do a lot of street photography. So those, those. I've already got into instagram recently and I've just been putting, putting that stuff on there, which I don't know how interesting it is. Generally a nice place to put that kind of stuff. I paint like these big portraits and they just ended up sitting around my house. No one wants to buy it. No one's to buy a giant picture of my mother, so they don't really sell them, so they just sit around. So actually, yeah, putting them on. At least that's not my mother. Just for clarity is your stuff is really good. Thank you. Are these. It's a caricature is Tom waits once. Excellent.

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       It's surprisingly good. I mean you think someone is really good at something like magic and you say, well that's about as good as he's getting. Get it. It's not like he's going to be that good at something else, but you are literally flicking through my instagram. Yeah, I mean you're, you're really good art artist.

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       Thank you very much. Have you done this your whole life? Not yet. Um, yeah. Pretty much like as a, as a kid I used to draw and paint a lot and always faces like I'm no good else, but a faces has always been my thing, so I should do like cut these kind of, you know, characatures and now I paint more, sort of straight pictures I guess. But it's nice if you do something that's kind of, you know, public, it's nice to do something that's private and it's that thing of something bigger than yourself to throw yourself into and dilute yourself in and it's great, you know, days, weeks of, you know, just being in my studio is just as lovely. That's a great thing.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       Do you find that stuff like that clears your mind for your other work?

Speaker 2:          00:06:29       I think it's, it's just the sheer contrast, you know, and one of my favorite parts of the year is touring and I get to do the shows in the evening and then the days are free and I'm like, I'm not in London, I'm in some other cities, so no one can. No one can like get me in for a meeting or anything. I just had the days free and I can write. I had a book on happiness that I wrote, which I wrote while I was on tour and it was just this amazing routine of just finding a coffee shop, spending the day writing, and then if that does get a bit, you know, a bit boring or a bit sad or something. If it's not quite coming together, you've Dang you then get to go out and be this amazingly charismatic, well rehearsed version of yourself on stage, which is, you know, full of adrenaline and lovely.

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       So that, that's an amazing routine. I think that's my favorite, favorite thing. So yeah, the painting and all that. Photography is an interesting one because you, you, you find yourself on the one hand kind of slightly because I do street photography so it's kind of, you know, out taking pictures of candid moments I guess. So your, you're a step out of it, but you're also very open and engaged and, and that feels like a really prime state that's very kind of porous, lovely state to be in and having been used to keeping my head down out in public because I realize I'm not known here at all. But in the UK I a bit. So if I, if I was out in public or generally kind of naturally kind of hunker, hunker down and now it's the opposite. It's totally changed that relationship. So that's good. Yeah. It's not just photography, just being out there and taking pictures of you having to be mindful and open and alert and uh, but at the same time, because I'm probably a little bit shy. So having that little step back thing as well because you're, you know, taking pictures is, is uh, I found that really, really great state and it's a lovely contrast to the, uh, the shows and the, you know, the rest of it

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       or you always shy or did you become more shy because of becoming really famous?

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       I was always,

Speaker 2:          00:08:25       well, not always. I think I grew quite, um, that's probably quite insecure to get. It was very charming and very, um, uh, quite bright and quite like socially, you know, that was, that was all good. But I think like inside I was, um, I was very intimidated by the kind of sporty kids you would have terrified me as a, as a, as a child. Um, and uh, I fled, uh, kids like kids, just sports, just not use that because I really didn't fit in with any of that. Um, and so when I first started, I started my career as a hypnotist and I, I saw this guy performing at university and I, uh, I just thought I'm going to, I'm going to do that. It just, I, I didn't realize at the time all these boxes that it was, you know, performing that sort of, you know, need for affirmation and love and center of attention and also the control aspect of it, you know, the kind of um, uh, yeah, the control aspect and also the kind of people that, particularly the sort of guys that would respond well to hypnosis and come up on stage and you know, and respond well to it, tell it to be exactly the kind of guys that would really intimidated me before.

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       So that was at an unconscious level and I hope I've grown out of that now. Main Labor. Yeah. It takes a lot of, it takes a lot of boxes. So that was, that's how I started in the Em's. Definitely driven by insecurity because Eddie's any sort of magic which sort of followed me on from the hypnosis, you're basically, it is the quickest, most fraudulent route of impressing people. That's the subtext is only look at my great, which is not that interesting after afterwards. So I've tried to, you know, as I've, as I've grown up, I've tried to move into a different area and one that's a little more resonant than just showing off. That's fascinating that you started out doing hypnosis, shows that a comedy show, I know it was sort of, um, I would mainly performance like uh, colleges and I do a demonstration and then have questions and questions and answers afterwards and I wasn't making people look stupid.

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       It was an entertainment show and I guess it was kind of funny, but it was um, it was, uh, it's just a really interesting thing and the trouble with doing on stage is because it gets mixed up with people just kind of playing along and stuff. So it, it's. But if you take that out of it, it's just a really interesting area and I've done this stuff for, you know, 20 years back home and I'm not, I don't think of myself as a hypnotist. That was just kind of where I, where I started. But the suggestion based techniques. So that is something I continued with and brought into different areas and I still don't fully understand it. You know, now you can have a quiet climates inside someone's head and know what they're experiencing. Like I used to do in the, what I used to do these like stage hypnosis shows.

Speaker 2:          00:11:09       The last thing I did was to, I'd tell these people on stage that I was invisible, right. And I'd, I'd float something through the air, right. Like this bottle I've got here is, it's normally something bigger like a chair and they'd be freaking out, running off stage and so on. But afterwards, when I'd had this kind of q and a I them, I'd ask them, what was your, what was your actual experience like, like, the show's over and I'll be honest, what we, what you're experiencing. And you'd get some people that would say, well yeah, you were obviously just floating that you were just holding it, but I kind of felt like I had to play along and then you'd get this interesting area in the middle of, of like, well I kind of, I now when I think that yes, of course it was you, but it was and I sort of knew it was you, but I am emotionally just completely.

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       I could only experience it as a terrifying floating bottle or whatever it was. So that's a bit like an actor, like getting caught up in a role I guess. Like they know, they know they're onstage and it's a character, but nonetheless emotionally committed. And at the other extreme, people that would not accept that it was me floating, it just, they that must have been on a wire or something. There's no, there's no way that I could drop you back at the picture in my memory of that thing. So how do you know? How do you, how do you judge what that experience is when there's and, and all those people that are saying, no, you are really invisible. Are they just saying that because they want to be like the best subjects in that, in that group. I mean, how do you tease it all apart?

Speaker 2:          00:12:22       It's that is, is that that must be a real issue, right? The people that just want to please you and are playing along. How can you tell if you were fighting people? Yeah, I can tell, but I. The way I use it now, he's kind of, I use it quite sort of subtly in the show. I don't like overtly hypnotize people, so that means it can mean one of two things. It either means it just, I'm not interested people playing along because I'm not just trying to create the effect of someone hypnotized. They need to genuinely be responding to this thing in order for the next bit to work, in which case I have to filter out anybody playing lumbered, but occasionally,

Speaker 2:          00:13:00       occasionally it doesn't matter. Like a lot of the time, like I'll get people up on stage and I'll shake their hand and they're, there's a rapid handshake induction that the guidance just falls to the floor. Um, and there are times that that matters and they have to be, that has to be really honest response. Other times I can tell they're sort of half into it and they're just a bit intimidated and, but for the 2000 people looking, that might look, it kind of might look like the same thing and then it won't, does exactly. Does that work? The handshake induction, what? It's, it's a, uh, I take no responsibility for explaining this to your tens of millions of listeners and viewers. Um, but, uh, it's, it's, you're, you're interrupting a, an automatic process, right? This is the, this is the key to it was made popular by, um, made popular by I guess Richard Bandler who's the guy behind nlp and so on. I don't know if he kind of created this thing, but perhaps perhaps Erickson did before him. I don't know. Anyway, you take an automatic process and you interrupted in the middle. So like when you're shaking hands with somebody, it's such a familiar process that when you start, you're not thinking, okay, I'm going to grip this person's hand now. Now I'm going to move my hand up and down with them a few times. Then I'll take my hand to what you just kind of do it automatically. And there's something about interrupting that that Leaves People Really

Speaker 2:          00:14:19       flummoxed and bewildered because they're really, really caught off guard. Like if you imagine somebody comes up to you in the street and says it's not half past seven,

Speaker 2:          00:14:27       you know, your reaction isn't to go, yeah, yeah, I know it's 20 past nine. Your reaction is, is a sort of, you think you've missed something, like you're trying to make sense of it. It's a strange, uh, Kinda put you on the back foot. And at that point if you to, if you've got somebody who's fairly suggestible and people coming up on stage, it's such an odd moment for them anyway. They're naturally wrote, suggestible that a clear instruction to sleep or whatever you want give them, tends to be taken very deeply and very often than you'll see on shake hands. And I'll, I'll break the pattern of the handshakes. I'll, I'll often take their hand and lifted up to their face and say sleep and show them their hand like that and they just sleep and well it's not sleep that it's a kind of um, it looks like.

Speaker 2:          00:15:08       I mean they, they'll do anything from eyes closed. Head drops down to just drop like a, like a dead weight on the floor, you know, what I found is most interesting actually. It was like applying this in slightly more useful everyday situations was as a sort of like a self defense technique. I was walking a between so I was like, must have been like 20 or something and I was at a magic convention and I was walking from one hotel to another and I'm dressing like a three piece velvet suit as skinny British law, but might as well have, you know, punched me in the throat, tattooed across my face. And this guy comes up and it's like he's drunk and he's about three in the morning. Drunk aggressive is with his girlfriend, clearly looking for a fight. And uh, he sort of, he comes up to me and he says, well, what do you, what do you fucking looking at when you're looking at?

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       And because I'd spoken about this, how to deal with this sort of thing, but it never found myself in this situation. I kind of had it all mentally rehearsed. So I said to him, I said, the wall outside, my house isn't four foot high and I guess there's an equivalent to this with sort of adrenaline dump. I think it's called and in martial arts, but there's a, it just like, he's got all this adrenaline and then a thing like that for me, which is just out of context. Like it makes sense. I'm not talking gibberish. It makes sense, but it's just out of context. So now suddenly he's thinking, I've what? I've missed something. So now he, he was sort of went what? And I said his girlfriend walked off and I said, the wall outside, my house isn't for, for high. I spent some time in Spain, the walls that were very high, but if you look at the ones here that they're tiny, they're nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:16:44       And then he just sort of broke down. He sort of at war, ha. And uh, started crying, what, you know, it wasn't quite crying, but it was just, it was like all the adrenaline and everything just just flooded out of him. And he sat down and I ended up sitting next to him on the, uh, on the road side. I'm asking him, you know, so what was the plan was I was going to try and stick his feet to the floor and lay out. His whole family just kind of collapsed and sat down. So yeah, that was because I knew it would be like this highly suggestible state and either way, the moment of aggression and passed. But I ended up, ended up weirdly sitting with them, asking him what had happened that evening and his girlfriend, I think she'd bottled somebody or something horrible had happened.

Speaker 2:          00:17:23       So we'd got out with all this aggression, but it's a, it's a good one, isn't it? If you just have like, um, it could be just a song lyric or just some, some weird kind of thing that you can just go into in those situations. I mean, if someone's running at you with a knife, it's a bit difficult, but you just, you, you're kind of strangely taking control of a situation. Otherwise what you're going to do if they say, what are you looking at? You can't, there's no way you can answer that without being on the back foot. So it just kind of nicely kind of inverts the situation and puts them on the bank vault, which anyway, it worked. It was a, it was kind of fun.

Speaker 1:          00:17:56       Isn't there like a process required to hypnotize someone? You could just do it that way and saying it didn't. Just talk them through some sort of a program that makes them think their foot is stuck to the floor.

Speaker 2:          00:18:07       I, it, it will. Depends on the moment I had. I used to hypnotize people in my, in my room when I was a student. Right. So I was the guy that did hypnosis, what are people coming regularly coming to to try it out? And um, I this, this one time I used to leave people with like if they were responsive to it and this was like I was really early days, it was like 20 minutes, half an hour of relaxing somebody and maybe suggesting that their hands were getting lightened floating or heavy and they couldn't lift them. So kind of, you know, kind of basic stuff. But I would leave them if they were very suggestible with the instruction that when you come back, if I click my fingers, you'll get back into the sleep state and they, you know, they kind of get conditioned to that. It'll often work even like a week later and this guy came and uh, I thought I'd seen him before.

Speaker 2:          00:18:52       I thought he'd been on the previous week. So he sat down and I go look at me and sleep, click my fingers. And he went out, whatever that means. Right? And then we did whatever it was. Maybe perhaps you wanted to stop smoking or his hands floating in the air. Whatever it wasn't at the end of it, I realized in talking to him that I hadn't met him before, so then I'm like, well, how did, how did, why did you respond to me clicking my fingers because I don't have magic fingers. There's nothing like anything going on here other than. And I realized it was just that. It was just that moment of my kind of confidence with it and the fact fortuitously that he was also very suggestible and put those two things together. That's what made it work. It was just that, that psychological moment for him that was more important than the nature of the 20 minute script that I'd been learning and using up to that point. So that was kind of a seminal seminal. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:19:41       Confidence in that he had already been under.

Speaker 2:          00:19:43       Yeah. I didn't question it because I really, I believe that he had and it just kind of, it just sort of happened and then he just. If he hadn't been a suggestible type and it probably wouldn't have worked, but luckily he was. And that kind of really, really changed the way that I, that I thought about hypnosis and also started this, you know, this realization that ultimately my, my kind of toolkit with what I do is, is the stories that people are telling themselves that's, that's kind of, that's really all there is. Even a magician showing you a card trick is just getting you to tell yourself a story, edit, edit this event in such a way that you go, oh, you know, I picked a card and then it disappeared and it was, it was in my pocket. He never went near me. And you it out.

Speaker 2:          00:20:27       All the bits that don't seem important. Like when he complimented you on your jacket earlier on in the day and may have stuck a card in there or the bit where he took the car back for a moment, whatever. Because you don't, you know, you're, you're being sold a story with a particular sort of edit points. And you know, to me that's interesting because that's what life is, you know, we have this infinite data source coming at us. We can, we just have to kind of reduce it to store is to make to make sense. I think stripping aside all the kind of Vaudeville and tacky associations of hypnotists and magicians and solid think there's something. There's something interesting at the heart of it. I think that that our storytelling capacity is endlessly fascinating to me.

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       Well, it's fascinating in that regard, but it's also fascinating that there seems to be like some cheat code, the human mind, like there's a, there's a way you can like lock into like an admin panel and all of a sudden you're doing things like telling people they don't really don't want to be smoking or putting them into this hypnotic mindset by just snapping your fingers and sang sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       It's odd. I think it is. I think it looks like that and that's the problem because it looks it. It's. You so often see it when performers are doing it and they're often going for kind of theatrical effect. If you go and look at it like a clinical environment where hypnosis are being investigated, it isn't like that at all. It's much more a kind of boring in a wiser, isn't, it? Doesn't have any theater attached to it as much more on, you know, kind of intuitively understandable had been hypnotized yourself. I'm terrible. I'm a really bad, really bad subject. I had one experience where I only one when I was in like a workshop thing that I was, there is a, like a, you know, a pain, a person that wasn't giving the workshop and um, I was sat with, uh, the, the, the exercise was, it really worked for me.

Speaker 2:          00:22:17       It might work for others. So you're split into pairs and uh, the idea is you start to describe a scene. So you sat, sat with this woman, you close your eyes, you start to describe a scene and you get back and forth adding details. Right? So she says I become laying on a beach. And um, so I just imagine that like, okay, now I'm going to beach and I can, um, I can feel the warmth of the sun on my face. So I'm just kind of like imagining it and joining in with the story. And then I just remember somebody going, okay, guys, time out, time for lunch. And I, I, I had been on a behind beat on a beach and I, I'd completely just, I'd been there like a dream. It was completely real at some point it tipped into that. That's the only experience I've had of it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:58       Other than that, I don't respond to it. I'm just not. I think it's just suggestibility. It's something about a. and we get it when you know, we get it, when a doctor gives us a placebo and we respond to that because this authority figure is giving us that or, or the way we absorb a opinions of people that we admire and experts that we admire. How we just more easily take those on board. Unquestioningly this is all the same thing. It's just suggestion. The trouble is most of the time it's done through the world of the performing hypnotists, which isn't. It isn't giving really a very clear and fair view of what was going on because it's so theatrical and so often you know, you're, you're relishing and things like I click my fingers and this guy went to sleep, but that's not really, you know, the, what are they doing?

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       Their Qa, they just, I think just kind of responding because you've just asked them to and they know that when you click their fingers, they're supposed to go to sleep is there's a real range of possible experiences that you might look like a power, but it doesn't mean it is. They might just be just complying. I was going to do some of this stuff on stage without using the hypnosis to show that there's. I don't think there's anything that happens under Moses that can't be done without a. and I was having this discussion with my friend Andy who directs and my stage shows with me and I was saying like that thing of, you know, when you, when a hypnotist get somewhere to eat an onion and says, you know, this is a classic hypnotic stone. Gives them a raw onion and says it's a delicious juicy apple.

Speaker 2:          00:24:27       Now we sit and enjoy it and you get somebody munching into an onion and like having no problem eating it. I was like, well, I'm sure that feels like if you're just going to pull it off without hypnosis, would that just happened anyway? And Andy said, I bet I bet you can use it anyway. And he went to my fridge, took out an onion, took a big bite of it, and it was fine because he's so. He's proving a point there, right? So he's in a different mental state than somebody going got a day to take a bite of that onion when suddenly you're like, you're preempting the, you know, the disgust and all the reasons not to do it, but the fact that he was just going, I bet you can do it. And trying to prove a point. Many, he did it and it was fine.

Speaker 2:          00:25:03       So that was a different mental state and it worked. So that wasn't hypnosis, but the end result still, if you do that onstage and pretended to hypnotize somebody first it would look like you've done something amazing. So I don't know. It is. It's, it's to me it's just, it's just that story that someone's telling themselves. What did it taste like? An onion to him or did it? It just, it's just, it would have. No, no, no, no. It would have tasted like an onion. I. There was no suggestion of female that are hypnotized. Does it tastes like an apple to them? Well, I don't know. It's like a monument. Invisible one of the. What are they seeing? I think for some of them it will, you know, taste and pain and things like that and discomfort. It's all very subjective. But the end result of doing this thing that looks like it couldn't happen without some magical process.

Speaker 2:          00:25:46       That's the key. And none of these things really demand that met. Even when even when you look at people being I'm undergoing surgery through hypnosis and being wide awake and being cut open. So you think, well that must be evidence. The hypnosis is some special thing because that couldn't happen otherwise, but of course it can, you know, the layer of skin that feels pain is actually sort of quite thin. So once you get through that, when you're moving organs around, that's not, that's not a painful process anyway. Plus very fully tend to use a bit, a little bit of like a local anesthetic anyway just to numb the very top layer of skin. So again, what looks amazing very often isn't, it's a, it's an endlessly rich and bizarre area to me. And I kind of, um, as I said, I don't really think of myself as a participant that the, that process, that kind of, uh, ability for people to get into this space where they could have that kind of experience is, um, is something I, you know, I'll always find interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:26:47       One of the recent stage shows I did a, it's called miracle. I don't know if you've seen it, but I'm faith healing in the second half. So using exactly the same idea. And I've got an audience that are like me, you know, that don't believe in that. And I'm saying, look, I mean I'm an atheist, I don't believe in this either, but will you just kind of go with me or at least at the start, because the results are a really interesting. And I, um, I just started doing this, this, I'm fighting, not really knowing if it was going to work. I thought, well, I can get some adrenaline going and I know could see the techniques that the charlatan faith healers we're using. And uh, I thought, well, I'll just, I'll, I'll do that. And I thought, well, the adrenaline kills pains, I think get some adrenaline going. There's bound to be people that said, oh, I had a pain in my back and now it's gone. But the actual results, admittedly with small percentages of the audience, right, not everybody, but the people that were coming up and saying, I had this problem and now it's gone. And they were, there was a woman that had a, she'd been paralyzed on one side of her body since a kid. And she's like, in her forties now she's in floods of tears going, I couldn't move my arm. And this was, this is a skeptical audience like me that know that there's kind of playing along with something. And uh, nonetheless, again, small percentage, not, not, not everybody, but having, having these kinds of experiences. It is.

Speaker 2:          00:28:04       So that's less of a psychological component of suffering, which, which is, which was really eye doing that show night after night after night. Well, faith healing has got to be a form of hypnosis, right? Yeah, exactly. It's the same world is playing. They both were, they both joined by is the idea of suggestibility and uh, it doesn't. And sometimes those healings, it's sort of, I mean, if you take an x ray before and afterwards, nothing's changing, but in as much as a lot can depend on this psychological component, it can, can really make a difference. It gives the percentages are getting smaller. So 3000 people in the audience, 300 people come up, 10 people come up on stage and I'm involving them in the show, but getting even smaller. There are people that like a year later we're getting in touch and say, just so you know, that thing did actually clear, like it hasn't come back because I thought it would only last for 10 minutes while they're on stage and then, which is why you don't tell people to throw the pills away and so on. Right? But we're in probably like that half a percent now, which is always going to be kind of pretty extraordinary. But um, uh, it was like a real, real thing. So when it's still, if you had 200 people and one of them actually cured from that, that is immensely bizarre. It's immensely bizarre, but it's, it's bizarre. And,

Speaker 2:          00:29:19       and I'm like, I had this bad shoulder for a long time and I, uh, I got really used to, when I put a jacket on, kind of putting this in my left arm, putting it in, like letting my left arm go dead and then using my right arm to pull the thing up. Right now I don't know how much I really need to do that anymore or whether I'm just doing it out of habit. But if somebody got me up on stage and said, your left shoulder is healed, it's now and kind of made me feel a bit now go on, try it, try and move your, move your arm. I think in the surprise of it and the sheer kind of just snapping out of that habit of being like, this is my dead arm, I probably would be very surprised that I could actually move it as much as I can.

Speaker 2:          00:29:58       You know, it's, it's just, it's like when you break it down, it's like not that amazing. But when you, when you, when you see the, the, the more kind of extreme and exciting ends at that. It's, it is mind blowing. And then you've realized how these performance, how you start to go mad yourself and think, well, I've got this special gift I could pack out stadia doing like, uh, I did think of one point, why don't I do like a secular healing show? I could say, well, this is, it's just, you know, it doesn't work in everybody and it may only work for 10 minutes, but it certainly works in some meaning of the word anyway. I didn't do that, but you know, you can start to go mad.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       Well, the processes of the mind, I mean the idea of the placebo effect is fascinating. The idea that your mind has some ability that you can't tap into consciously, but you can in some sort of a subconscious sense. Someone gives you something and if you're convinced that it's doing something positive and it actually will have some benefit to you of real, tangible, measurable benefit and it doesn't seem to make sense. There's no mechanism that we can trace.

Speaker 2:          00:31:02       There's no mechanism. No, it's what I found works really well is I've done a few shows on placebo is for me, I found the key is the person gets to absolve any responsibility for the change themselves. So they. I've done a couple of things where this new show I have on Netflix now called sacrifice. A guy thinks he's got a micro chip implanted in him, which is doing all the work. Uh, another show I've done is, was a placebo injections they were getting. So they fill the drug is doing the work, but the key is they don't have to. They don't think they're doing any work at all. This thing is taking care of that for me. And that's really powerful because suddenly it's, it's that thing of I don't have to do the person thinking, I don't have to make this happen myself. There is no onus on me.

Speaker 2:          00:31:47       I don't have to do any anything. This, this magic formula is somehow doing it is hugely powerful. So that. Yeah, that's, that's a, that's A. I think that's a big, big part of it, which is why a lot of the. When we, when we did the placebo program, we created this whole like I'm fake a pharmacological building. We had a building. We just fitted out with actors and equipment and stuff to just create this environment that was going to be convincing before the injections were even given. And these people that had various like fears or problems or things that would be just going to just investigate and see how well the placebo worked and uh, yeah, it did. But that, that that's a helpful thing. Feeling. There's just something in you making it,

Speaker 1:          00:32:29       making it happen. Yeah. Almost like a subconscious optimism or something like that. Yeah. I've, I've wondered if that sort of mindset that allows you to experience a beneficial result of a placebo if that in some way transfers over to everyday life events if having this may be unfounded sense of optimism or this a bizarrely positive outlook or this, uh, almost undo confidence actually can have some sort of a beneficial tangible result in the real world in terms of actual events that take place. Whether it's because of the way you interact with other human beings that they are being influenced by your positive attitude, attitude and energy and the confidence and enthusiasm. And then therefore things go smoother or whether it's really some sort of a factor of the way you interchange with reality itself. And that your attitude actually has an effect on events.

Speaker 2:          00:33:35       I think it gets vastly overrated. I'm a big advocate of strategic pessimism. I think the the problem with that kind of the problem with unwavering self-belief, yes. Is that it just doesn't. That doesn't quite map into how life works, I think. I think the Greeks had this down, so if you imagine a kind of a graph, so you've got your, your y axis going up here of your aims and things you want to achieve and then your x axis is just what they used to call fortune stuff. That life throws back at you that you have no control over, no control at all. So we are told a lot nowadays that you just set your goals, believe in yourself, visualize this as if we can crank up the sort of the line that we're living. Yes, right up in line with our goals and our aims and so on.

Speaker 2:          00:34:27       The reality is there's always life like pushing back. So actually what we lead is an x equals y line. That that's a kind of more realistic, I think appraisal of what our life is. So actually kind of sort of, I think making peace with that which allows for all the optimism you want, but also makes peace with the fact that at some point that might let you down, you know, you can spend your life climbing a ladder and then realize you had it against the wrong wall to quote Joseph Joseph Campbell, you know, you can set goals that they may just be the wrong goals and you may achieve them. And then like, you know, now what I've got, you know, a friend who um, uh, spend a long time building up a company and selling it and it'd been driven to do this all his life because he liked, needed to sort of achieve, to feel like, you know, that he was a kind of really worth something that was, he was all about achievement and then he sells the company, achieves that dream and then he didn't know what to do with his life because that urge was still there.

Speaker 2:          00:35:27       Now it had nowhere to go and actually ended up in therapy because of it. It was such a strangely a counter intuitive thing. So I, you know, I'm, what about changing the world for the better, but I think we have to make mental space for the fact that, um, like when, when Freud credit psychoanalysis, he wasn't trying to make people happy, he called it, he called it restoring, restoring natural unhappiness. My life is basically going to be unhappy sometimes and he was trying to get rid of unnatural unhappiness as he saw it, like it sort of neurotic unhappiness and restore a kind of an easy relationship to life and fortune. So to me that's, that's the case. I'm always a bit, was a bit skeptical of the kind of, uh, just unwavering positivity. Yeah. No, I agree with you. I mean, I think that unwavering positivities usually delusional.

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       Yeah. But a certain amount of positivity at schools. Oh yeah, of course. A certain amount, a certain amount of the dangerous. It's like the faith healers, right? So the faith healing thing of you go away, you don't take your pills, and if this condition returns, which it's going to, it's your own fault because you didn't have enough faith right now that's quite a toxic cycle of self blame. It's exactly the same cycle that you get when you read. Like the secret, for example, says quite explicitly, if these great things don't come your way, it's because your self believer wavered for a second. You only have yourself to blame. She's very explicit about that. Um, and that, that's the problem. It's it, it's great if you can put it in a certain context. If not, it's sadly can be a recipe, I think for anxiety and just a feeling of failure that you don't understand where it's come from.

Speaker 2:          00:37:07       Well, but I was trying to get at was I wonder if it's a component in a much larger picture. Not that it's the one thing like the key, like the real problem with the secret is the idea that you're taking all these people that are already successful, they've achieved a certain result, and then you're asking them, how did you achieve that result? Well, I thought positive and I just really put my mind to it and I dreamt on it. They all have this in common. Well, you know, who also thought positive bunch of losers. They tried and you know, they got hit in the head by asteroids or car accidents or the world turned bad on them. That actually can happen too. Yeah. So it's just, you're using, you have a biased focus group executive about it. Yes, exactly. It's exactly. And, and the, the idea of setting a goal fixating on it and ignoring all the haters and ignoring all the people that will bring you down is a perfect recipe for failure as much as it's a common anecdotal, a story of success.

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       Well, the problem with that is if you just focus on the one. The thing about human beings I think is that we really do need other people's input and interaction and the idea that you're going to work in a vacuum and create this great masterpiece without any interaction with other human beings as doesn't really. It doesn't really work like that. It doesn't because life is active and messy and ambiguous and ambivalent. And W I think the trouble is we get hung up on nouns like happiness or meaning or even the self, right? Because I think, I think actually these things are verbs there. Webby we sell as a verb. You know, maybe something that happens dynamically in the relationships that were maybe ourself is something that kind of extends out into the world and is kind of fluid in that way. And happiness maybe is.

Speaker 2:          00:38:44       Maybe that's an activity, meaning is maybe an activity, but we, w we reduce these things to nouns. Like they're really neat, easy, isolated things and uh, they're really not. So I can in a lot of the TV shows that I do, I'm putting people through like a transformative process and they're reacting to kind of really extreme situations. And I always had people saying, oh, I wouldn't do that love already, but think it's all fate because I would never do that. But they're viewing themselves as this isolated. There's just this sort of individual kind of separated from everything else. Watching that and thinking how they behave, what they're not doing is thinking. And if I were in that situation with the same pressures and then that's, that's amazing that that does changes that were not there for two, 300 years. We've had this idea that we are, these kind of all goes back to like not being influenced by kings and priests.

Speaker 2:          00:39:41       Like it was John Locke. It's like the, the beginnings of that, that idea that, no, no, we, we, uh, we should not, we should have this kind of personal authority and it's drifted into a through can't. I think it's drifted into a really unrealistic and unfair sense of how isolated beyond we're not. We're clearly social creatures. I, there's a show on Netflix called the push, uh, which I did, which was to see whether, if you create this environment of social compliance. So it's a big party, right? There's one guy and it doesn't know that this is being filmed, that is part of a TV show. Everybody else is an actor. And the plot was to see, could you get him to murder somebody to push someone off the roof to the death as far as he's concerned. Obviously it doesn't. No one really dies. Right? And it just starts where he kind of gets roped into helping out at this event.

Speaker 2:          00:40:28       And it's a big high stakes event. Everyone's in, um, you know, Tuxedos, but he didn't get the memo for the dress codes. We already comes in feeling a bit and then he gets, he gets roped into helping out and like the first thing is asked to do is to label, um, meat filled sausage roll snacks as vegetarian, right? Because they, the vegetarian ones haven't been delivered. So it's just like a little kind of foot in the door thing and it just builds and it builds. And, uh, it gets to this point when he's on a roof having been through this really dark, extraordinary and sort of hilarious and massively anxiety, juicing journeys, a lot of emotions you go through and you watch it and then faced with this massive pressure to, to kill this guy. And I don't want to, don't want to spoil the ending because it's a stronger. But um, this is like, it's, that's what it's all about. You know, how your, how your sense of like the story you tell yourself about who you are. It's just, isn't, isn't, isn't real casual about the new shipping, about net are the sacrifice because anything you want. But can I ask you one question about this? What I mean, do you feel

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       a certain sense of moral confusion when you're trying to talk someone into potentially and you realize that if this wasn't a show, if similar or maybe even more powerful pressures were in play and this guy was suggestible and he found himself in very unusual circumstances where it seemed like a good idea to kill this person. Like you're, you're introducing this thought and this, this scenario into a person's mind that perhaps could go cradle to the grave and never have that.

Speaker 2:          00:42:09       It's, it's kind of the opposite, what it actually, it's just hard to about giving away the ending, but the, what it does is actually mentally rehearse somebody. What this guy took away from it is the knowledge that if he was ever in a situation again where there was anything like that nature of compliance that he now has the tools to just like stand up to it because you need that kind of promotional. And likewise for viewers hopefully watching it too. That's kind of the idea. You're all, we're all emotionally rehearsing it with him. Um, and unless you've been trained in staff and you know it like that, you need like an emotional experience of it to know when that thing happens, to just have the resources to understand that you can be manipulated. These are very. Although it does, I realize it doesn't sound like it. And that showed the purchase. I mean, it's kind of like the darkest of all the shows, but they are, they are there for like a good reason. There's like a, there's a reason for doing it. Everybody that comes away, it was always like, you know, that's, that, that was a great thing to do. Best thing I've ever done. You know these even though the journeys themselves but do look very dark.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       Well he sounds like the guy who had a positive outlook on it sounds like

Speaker 2:          00:43:16       it can learn from their mistakes. Yeah. But there's some people that when confronted with some new situation like, wow, I really was going to push that guy off the roof. Like this is me. Like I didn't think that was me. Now I know now I know that I'm capable of doing that. If I get manipulated to the point like wow. And then they have a lot of like real confusion and, and, and perhaps a lack of faith in themselves and their ability to make a decision. That's Kinda, that's Kinda my job to make sure that the framing and that, yeah, that's kind of, you know, I mean, I get these ethical questions that are worth asking. And ultimately my concern with these, I've done a lot of these shows where people are put through these dark journeys to reach a valuable point, much more valuable than perhaps the end of the porch, which is quite dog.

Speaker 2:          00:44:04       But um, the, my, my only real concern is their experience. So the guy that has just done this new show, for example, I said to him before I came out and started talking about the show, I said, what do you want me to say about your experience? And you said, aside from having my kids, that is the best thing I've ever done. But I know other people watching the show will say, how can you now, can you justify that you're manipulating somebody and why did you just want to kill you at the end of it? And that the reality is it's just this one guy's experience I care about and that's something that I can manage and create and make sure that he's left in the right way. And also these are people I just like we'll remain friends with for the rest of my life. So it's not like great, you've done the TV show.

Speaker 2:          00:44:41       Thank you. Goodbye. This is, there's a genuine, um, intimate bond. Well, we all, like, we all end up falling in love with me and the production team falling in love with these people because you're putting them through this like 10 month projects. Half was a little different with them sacrifice because he, um, he thought he was taking part in one show, which was a documentary when actually there was this whole other thing going on, but a lot of the time they have no idea how long was pushed for it. Like push was. Well that was only like, it. That was like one evening of actual filming, but they, because it was just one light real time event, but the preparation for it, you know, it goes back a bit. I did, uh, the biggest one was I did a show called apocalypse, which isn't on Netflix.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       I mean if you go down the rabbit hole, it'll be somewhere on youtube where we ended the world for somebody. So we, we took control of his, a news feed, a TV we filmed like special editions, tv shows, new shows that watched, fed them into a drip by drip, created the idea of the world was going to wait and there's going to be this meteor strike even I could be out in the cafe and the radio in the cafe because we'd know we'd be in that cafe. There's a radio playing with Djs that he knows that we're talking about this thing that is supposed to happen. And then we stage it. We staged this pyrotechnic end of the world thing and this kind of a sort of controlled enough environment we could get them into where we could stay to that convincingly. And then he wakes up in the second episode to episode thing in this post apocalyptic seemingly like weeks later in a hospital, like everyone's gone.

Speaker 2:          00:46:12       The places abandoned, um, uh, some infection spreads. So there is like, this is the plot and he then lives through the plot of the wizard of Oz to find his way back home and the point of it was this stoic idea of valuing what you have because this was somebody who by all reports was, you know, Lazy, selfish, took advantage of his parents who was living with never had a proper job. It was just kinda like needed to value what he had said. The stoics would say, you know, just rehearsed taking everything away. So when you returned to the stuff you have, you valued that rather than just always desiring more. So that was that idea, kind of writ large, take everything away and the world. But again, like he was transformed by it really changes. You're still in touch with this person. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:46:51       Yeah. And so is this, this is a permanent shift, permanent shifts. He ended up being a teacher in a special needs school that has kind of worked his way up through and is now like, you know, he's getting married and it's just. Yeah, it's lovely. That's crazy. I'm not that I can take credit for all of that, but you know, it was definitely a big part of that. Well, near death experiences are often incredibly beneficial to people make big giant shifts in their attitude and their perception of the world. And I realize that time is finite and then it could have been taken away from them and they feel like they have a new lease on life. I mean, you really can become a totally different person after something like, well, that's what's happened with this guy fills in the, in the, in this new show, which is also the first, like brand new thing I've done for, for Netflix.

Speaker 2:          00:47:33       There's a couple of other shows. But what is it called? It's called sacrifice sacrifice. So the plot is, I take this Guy Phil, who is, uh, an American guy, his father's, his father's British British links, but he's an American guy living in Florida, Cocoa Beach, Florida, big, a right wing guy, strong views against immigration. And I using these covert psychological techniques, try and get him to the point where he will willingly lay down his life and take a bullet for an illegal Mexican immigrant already somebody believes is, you know, it's an actor because it's the whole thing, whole thing with actors. So, um, so he went through this journey, which is not a, it's not a political story at all. I mean, obviously it kind of resonates, but it was ultimately a story about compassion and, and uh, and humanity. And there's ultimately a very human moment that either he found himself in.

Speaker 2:          00:48:30       Um, and you know, the guys like made a huge difference to him. You know, it's, it's a. So this is, I got done a giveaway exactly how it turns out. The process take it was about 10 months there for him. For him it was like maybe three, four months. It was like the beginning block of this year. But there's like two levels to make any shows you've got to write the I, you know, that this is the plot of the show and finding that and make that happen for him. But you've also got to create this whole thing has, it's like the Truman show it, you're creating a fiction for somebody that has to be completely convincing. That's a whole other level of, of kind of work. Plus, you know, you gotTa make sure this guy is robust enough to go through something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:49:09       So there's a whole vetting procedure that has to happen without him realizing what it's all about. That's a great way of putting it. Robust bus psychologically, right? Yeah. Yeah. That is a crazy amount of preparation and production work. Is He? Uh, it's, it's, it's huge in the apocalypse show. That was like one moment when we had to just make this guys because there was the idea that there's electrical interference with the meteors just had to make his TV pop off in his room, like just sort of cut out and to do that, there were two guys out in his garden shed. I'm waiting. Had to be there all day because I couldn't come in and out of the garden because you might see them pulling a cable at this moment to make the TV go. But then they couldn't leave because he might see them, so they had to spend the night in this garden shed and this is like after three months of not having a day off as well.

Speaker 2:          00:49:51       So that's like a nothing moment than normal ever remember from the show. But yeah, a huge amount of huge amount of work. I always get people saying, oh, it's all fake. We haven't really done it. I think it's just that they won't believe you should actually go to all that trouble for the paranoid. Like if you, if you did that to a naturally paranoid person or person with a touch of schizophrenia, which is why they have to be vetted very carefully, very carefully at any point during the process. Of course we can like stop it, I can, you know, I can put that would suck, wouldn't it? That would 10. And they see a guy starting to question reality and look at clouds in an odd way. Next thing you know. Oh boy. I think, I think he's slipping away. Yes. So yeah, that's never happened.

Speaker 2:          00:50:32       It's always been, it's always been hugely. Uh, that is an amazing process though. I mean, it's amazing how much prep work is involved in something like that. Just set up the radio where they walk into a place to different news broadcast. I mean, that is, that's fun. The Tab most terrifying was the for him was the kind of end of the world moment because we had this fake fake radio broadcast from, from the BBC and it was just so convincing. It was just magic blood go cold. More of worlds type stuff. But in this, like in this thing, in a sacrifice, there was a, like a amazing pivotal moment in it when he, um, we do this staring tests which was developed by New York psychology professor. And the idea is you just, you might have come across it, you just stare silently into someone's eyes for four minutes and it's, it's the most amazing thing because obviously the first thing is you get listed of awkwardness and this kind of giggling and, and then that tends to stop and then you're just facing a human being and like you've sort of somehow broken through all the kind of crap.

Speaker 2:          00:51:38       And then you just see like a person that's like living and struggling like you are and someone with a private life that like, that's a big thing for me. Like, you know, we, we, we go through life seeing people general generally at their best light, you know, generally people will present their best version of themselves to you. If you have a couple over for dinner, you'll tend to see that couple at their best. So you had this skewed idea of how together other people or how impressive other people are, how great other couples are compared to how you are with your partner. And we missed that like, because we know for us we have this big clumsy, embarrassing, lumbering giant of a, of a private life that's just following us around and it's particularly now, you know, with instagram and all that, people are branding themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:52:21       So, I mean it's like, it's so unfair in terms of the difference between how you perceive yourself and how you perceive everybody else. Um, so again, you know, there's the store is that we'd kind of a living out so that, you know, it takes like four minutes of this bizarre staring thing to kind of reach a moment of just suddenly I think hitting a point of just seeing another human being and everything that comes with that. And it was a big moment for this guy, phil going through it. It was a really. We tried a couple of things then that you see in the shoulder don't work out quite well. And then um, and then this a really emotional moment when he, he just has this big change. Yeah. It's think also just being able to do a TV show that really like changes somebody quite aside from how popular the show is or how well it works as a show or who watches it, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:53:11       Just to actually feel like, you know, at some point in my life I've done it a positive thing just for one person with TV, which is like, you know, generally kind of a pretty. I'm more authentic kind of medium. So to be able to just do something meaningful as you know is, is good. Well, listen to, it sounds amazing. It doesn't just sound good. It sounds like quite a work of art that you've managed to figure out a way to coordinate all these moving parts and trick someone into accepting a bunch of different versions of reality that you're presenting to get these results. It said, well, I've got a big production crew that will, you know, it's not all of me. I've got to write the thing and he was on it. And so on that, that the, um, the we kind of worked on over the years.

Speaker 2:          00:53:58       We had small, like little things that involved a involve those kinds of plots that, that was the first show I did, like that was taking a guy who, if not as we fill in sacrifice and she's bringing out someone's here. Right? That's really what it's about. That's kind of the story you're seeing somebody go through a big change, but bringing out the hero and the um, the first show he did like that involve this guy who at the end of this, his own journey had been through, finds himself on an airplane, is terrified of flying, but he, you know, we created this situation where you had to be on a flight and you didn't do anything to do with us. Everyone's an actor in the plane. We've got hidden cameras throughout the plane. Then there's this, there is a medical emergency and will somebody land the plane? Someone needs to step up and do it.

Speaker 2:          00:54:48       Yeah. It's called here at 30,000 feet. Oh, I just, just to talk through the edit because it's not, it's kind of a spoiler, but it doesn't matter. He, he, he does it right. He rises up, has this moment. He goes to the cockpit. Now he is highly suggestible. Right? I've used him because he is suggestible so I know that I can put them to sleep in a vertical was by clicking my fingers. Right. He's conditioned to that. So I step out before he ended the cockpit, click my fingers, he sort of zonked out. He's got very conditioned to this throughout the process, stick him in a wheelchair, we land the plane, he wakes up in a, about to walk into one of those convincing simulators that they use for, uh, for pilot training, uh, and it's kind of a night flight. So that was, we found out that was the most convincing thing was to have it when it's dark.

Speaker 2:          00:55:33       So he now goes in believing is in the cockpit of a real plane, 30 feet, 30,000 feet up in the air. He's got the guy on ground control who is, you know, Internet obviously is everybody is talking him down getting into that on the plane and he just, it's just amazing. This, this guy as in his mind, you know, is landing, was playing, saving the lives of 300 people and that he steps out and then the thing is revealed to him and it's so emotional. And then there's a, you know, the gaming means that Michael Douglas Philomena has always been a point of reference for me. So he comes out, there's like a big party of everyone that's been on his journey, all these people, these actors that have been, you know, taking it in this direction. Yeah. So it was amazing. So I've, I've, I've, over the years kind of work with these kind of, uh, these plots, these kind of immersive Truman show style a plots while at the same time doing stage shows. I do, I do a live show every year as well, which is kind of a bit more like an old fashioned sort of magic mind reading kind of kind of show. Um, but uh, yeah they are, they are these, you know, these extraordinary journeys. But I just do like maybe one a year because they take, you know, they just, it.

Speaker 1:          00:56:39       So it seems like not only does it take too much time, but it also really, you rely so heavily on the improvisational abilities of all these other people. Their ability to adjust an act normal and to be convincing. Yeah. And to follow the plot and not deviate at all. And the LAS,

Speaker 2:          00:56:55       because we used for sacrifice worse, so good. It's just like, it's just like in your blood or whatever, so, so good. And they were like big at the end that like big sort of aggressive racist biker characters that we use. Terrifying. And uh, yeah, but just a hilarious thing of like they are because they were bikers as well, so they are big like Harry intimidating people. But at the same time they want to know about the motivation and whether they did a right listening. Got Artists bombed audio. Odd combination. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:57:24       What a fantastic idea for a show. And so uniquely original. I mean it just seems like there's so much work involved in something like this. You must obsess over that.

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       I, the process is I come up with an idea. So like let's, which is normally we normally sit, I sit with a couple of guys that are at the shows with. We normally drive themselves mad thinking of ideas and then one of us normally me goes, oh, can't we just, let's just end the world and it zombies all. Let's a safe someone we can get someone to push up off a building or with this one, because I'd done the push, I wanted to kind of do the opposite of it. Something that we saving a life and much more redemptive story than, than the. So the idea is the first thing and I try and combine a really strong dramatic hook with a really, like a good reason for doing it. Otherwise you're just making like a controversial, shocking thing for the same. Which languages? No interest. So a, well that's a beautiful perspective to that you actually want to benefit someone through this crazy prank you're playing on them. Yeah. Yeah. Otherwise, exactly. It would just be a crazy horrible. And there's, there is like part of the enjoyment of the show I guess is a little bit of that. It's kind of a little bit, but that's, that's uh, the, the, you know, the, the shows. I think they have a lot of heart and a lot of them

Speaker 1:          00:58:46       thought you were intended to be beneficial to these people is what transforms that you have empathy for these folks. Yeah. And you, you, you truly care that that alone makes everything else better. It makes the whole, if the whole thing is just like, I'm smarter than these dummies and I'm just going to trick them and we've had that show before many, many times and make people feel terrible and it's cringe inducing when you watch it and you can't look away, but that you are doing this. And the end result is actually a benefits their perspective and actually might change their life for the better. That's extraordinary. Amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       Thank you. Well that's, that's, that's the hope. The way that I do it, the way that I changed them is through conditioning. So I, um, this is a technique I've used a lot over the years. Have you kind of take the emotional state you want the person to have at the end a, break it down into components and then attach each one of those to a, to a trigger. So this guy, Phil, uh, in sacrifice is using, um, I can app which he thinks is sort of talking to this. I'm at the microchip. He hasn't him because he thinks he thinks we can. We really do like cut him open and seemingly. Yeah, we just don't, you know, it's a placebo. We don't really put it in. But now you do cut them. Yeah. We caught him and stitch it back up. Yeah. Wow. Um, I don't think it needs that.

Speaker 2:          01:00:04       Don't need stitches for. It's kind of a small car, but it's a scaffold going in normal. Um, so he thinks he's using this app which is kind of helping motivate him but what it's doing, it's attached. It's giving him this sound like this little jingle that gets attached to all those feelings of motivation. So that means that when he finds himself in this kind of final scene where he has this choice to step in and save a life, that we can have the same jingle on the radio that plays and you know, it's like that thing of you hear a song when you're breaking up with someone and it's a horrible period of your life and then five years later you hear the same solid and it just brings it all back. That process or obviously like you know, advertising as the big example of that is the premise behind something like the Manchurian candidate that there's some way they can snap and then you go back to the state of mind.

Speaker 2:          01:00:53       That's more kind of, I guess overtly hypnotic. That's like a post hypnotic suggestion. This isn't, this is more gentle because he needed to make the decision himself. The idea was not that it'd be some kind of hypnotized robot if that would even work. Anyway, you know, this, this is, this is about creating a trigger. Those feelings of empathy are important. A lot of the shows about empathy and a lot of the show is about the desire to act and then he's, he finds himself in this situation, which is extreme. He has no idea at this point. It's anything to do with the filmings finished that will happen in England as far as the concerned is gone back home. We had time to forget all about it and then ends up stranded in this situation where it all happens. Um, and then I trigger these things off.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       So I'm giving him this kind of psychological nudge and then it's, you know, what, what will happen, will he, will he, will he rise up and take it like that, the guy landing the plane. It's kind of like what, what, what ultimately, you know, it's that guy's decision and it's also, I think it's a story about stepping out of the kind of, the, you know, the, the, I guess the show resonates politically, but it's not a political show that the, there's like there were political narratives we get constrained by and we forget that attitude to the dialogue between the sides that you know, where humanity emerges and will we find truth. So this is also, I guess a story about a guy coming out of his particular sociopolitical narrative and just finding something that ultimately is just a human, a human quality, kindness, compassion. And these are not political qualities.

Speaker 2:          01:02:22       Although they ended up getting politicized, but they're not, they're not. I think there are a lot of people are gonna Watch this and want that to happen to them. Like I need some sort of a transformative prank played on me to be. I think people do. We do get caught and ruts right, and we do get stuck on momentum. We get stuck following the same patterns over and over again. It's very difficult to change your life. This is the thing that makes us so great at evolving. Our ability to adapt is the same thing that just. It ties us down. So like all through life. So from an early age like we merged in this world and we're very quickly given messages about what our relationship with that ship to that world is. This is what people are like, this is what they want from you.

Speaker 2:          01:03:05       You are not powerful. The world is powerful, you know, and that that is, it's going to be skewed. You said that I love this, that the greatest burden a child has to bear is the unlived life of its parents. Such a great thing to your starting point is this skewed story and then you just go through life looking for things that just fit and recreate that. Those patents because they feel so comfortable. You know, you're what you learned about love from your parents. You've start to bring to your adult relationships and project all that stuff on a, on your partner. If you think about, you know, the, if you've had a nice loving upbringing, you are getting a ridiculously skewed version of what love means. Like we know as adults how difficult it is raising kids. We never saw that as kids. We never saw our parents going off and screaming at each other.

Speaker 2:          01:03:54       The next room wants to be going to bed. We just have this sort of impossibly uh, hopefully, you know, if we've had a, had a happy one, we'd get this impossible, um, template of what love is and should be. And then we just dumped that on the poor adult partners which nobody can live up to. So our ability to adapt, to internalize stories about who we are and then like mistake that for reality is just a, is just what makes living just difficult and complex. And also the narratives that come through fiction narratives from films and books and songs. The versions of romance and. Yes, particularly with that. Yeah, I love the idea that I'm done. If you never landed Bhutan is a British philosopher and writer and he said, you know, if you go to bed twice a week with your partner thinking, oh, the fuck am I doing with this person, that's normal. That's a normal thing. I like. To me that's more useful information than you know, how to make your relationship perfect. These things aren't perfect and again, living, living with the understanding that you know, life is devoted. What about three times a week, three times a week. I think that's probably pretty normal as well. In general, what's the number where you should start to read? Five. Two good nights. We have two good nights though. Five nights a hell of a two of them. She's the best. Yeah. What do you do? What do you do?

Speaker 1:          01:05:23       Yeah, I think the. The narratives that we get from fiction or they're very confusing to people, particularly people that are very romantic, they have these ideas that their life is going to be like one of their favorite films and that that's what they're looking for. They're holding out there, holding out for when the music plays in, the closeup is there and

Speaker 2:          01:05:41       and those stories stopped. Going back to this guy mandible. Tony wrote a lovely book on this. Those fit the trouble with those films that those stories. They stopped when the people fall in love and get together. That's what. That's when it starts. That's when the tough stuff starts that we could do with some good strong fictional frameworks to sort of absorb that. That's when the tufts stop. It's like it's like death. It's the same thing, isn't it? We have no. We've kind of lost touch with the cultural narratives around death that gave it some meetings and now when it happens, it's just as absurd, scary thing that we don't know what to do with. The only narrative we have that we have absorbed, I guess, is that of the brave battle at someone's fighting, which is so unhelpful for the person that's in that situation makes everyone else made me feel better, but just adds like eventual failure and letting everyone else down to this person's burdens.

Speaker 2:          01:06:28       It was what they should, what they should. What we should feel in that at that time is you know, that this is, this is when we can bring out if we have the opportunity to bring our stories to some kind of ending, you know, if you watch, if you watch a film or read a book, that final scene makes sense of everything that's happened before. This doesn't happen in live. It is kind of. And so we should be like author of our stories more than at any point before death. And you know, if we have the opportunity, what happens is the opposite. We become like cameos in this story, you know, the main characters or our loved ones or the doctors or people making all these decisions and we kind of get sidelined. So yeah, these fictional or mythical storage, just these things that just give us a sense of where our experience fits into a wider sense of meaning. We've, you know, we've, we've kind of lost touch with that the last couple of hundred years and there's a lot of good stuff that's come with that because we've embraced, you know, science and knowledge at the expense of superstition. Of course, but I, you know, we've kind of lost touch of something so we've lost a little bit of touch with

Speaker 1:          01:07:30       nature and the natural laws of things living in dying and I think we as human beings today are probably more alienated from particularly the death of farm animals and things along those lines. Like where, where our food comes from, like actually seeing death. Even if your dog is sick, you bring him to the vet, the vet puts them down, you know, all these things that people probably experienced firsthand for hundreds and hundreds of years, particularly like raising animals and that is done is just completely removed from the equation.

Speaker 2:          01:08:05       Those folks. Yeah. That sort of embodied dialog or that dialogue with ecology with nature is interested in. There's like view of like what, what the kind of indigenous peoples, uh, well, like dad, you have to shame and our view of what the Shaman is is so skewed by our kind of western mode. The, what the, the tapping into is not like it isn't the supernatural. That's not sort of the, um, that's not really the mode what you have and you still have it in these, uh, indigenous peoples that sort of say live like, um, rural Asia and so on that were, these, these, these ways of living is still going on, is what's, what's clear is it's not the supernatural, it isn't the spirit, it's, it's all about a really easy relationship with the natural world. So an example of this is a great book called the spell of the sensuous by David Abrams, who actually was a magician originally.

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       He went out and lived amongst his people and he eats, he talks about this and he said there was a, he was staying in this compound, this shamans compound. And the, um, the shamans wife would bring him some fruit every morning, but you also had these little like banana leaves with Rice in and she would, she was going off and doing something else with those and he asked where they were going and should all those for the spirits of the house. Right. So what, and then she'd come back and without them we were just wondering kind of what that meant and what he was doing. So one day he just kind of followed and watched. Gentry was placing these little pockets of these little things of rice out around the perimeter of this compound and he was watching it and from a distance and he saw the rice start to move and yet a moment of like, oh, this is the spirit, what is this?

Speaker 2:          01:09:48       And then the rise moved along the ground and you've, oh, it's aunts, it's aunt. So what she's actually doing, she's putting out rice for the ants. So then he had the thought of, Oh, it isn't spirits, it's just ants. And then you realize now of course the ants kind of are the spirits, right? So this is a house where food is prepared or they have a lot of, of big events. And an ant infestation would be just disastrous for them. So the spirit of the offering to the spirits of the house is a kind of a dialogue with the answer is going to, if we were going to put this rice out, can you just, if you just have the rise, if we do this every day, will you leave us alone? Um, and then that's it. Like it's, it's kind of that it's quite simple dialogue and I sort of this lovely kind of embodied relationship with nature that of course we're so far from here.

Speaker 2:          01:10:38       So interestingly, we do tend to pack a lot of ideas into the, you know, the supernatural even like the unconscious and depth psychology and so much I'm a big fan of, but we can take all this, the unknown stuff and shove it into these kinds of bottomless pits. Whereas actually, interestingly, if you trace it back, it seems like it just wasn't like that. It was this very, uh, well it doesn't, it depends on what they're doing is particularly with Sherman Sherman is concentrating on psychedelic drugs. They're an Iowaska church and they're giving people dimethyltryptamine like this is the, they are dealing with the supernatural. A very bizarre

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       and intense transformative experience they're putting people through and there's different like that term Shaman. It really, it kind of was very rare, very rare to be discussed up until about maybe 20 plus years ago and it seems like there's been some sort of a psychedelic revolution over the last couple of decades and it's almost become a little bit too popular here were a bunch of people are profiting from it or they're. They're opportunists and they're their labeling themselves as shaman. I think the term that they use in Peru, they call them plastic Shazam and, and they're, they're setting up shop and putting together this Iowasca brew and having all these Americans come in, fly in and Europeans are looking for, you know, air quote, spiritual experience and these are not necessarily pure shaman and the greatest sense of the word. It's a different. This is what we think of when we think of Shaman today.

Speaker 1:          01:12:09       We think of someone who conducts a psychedelic ritual. Exactly. Which I know very little of you know, you've had any experience. I'm excited if I put, you know, real real coffee with DECAF and how come? Why haven't you tried something? Nothing. Psilocybin. Nothing. No, I never even smoked a cigarette or anything. It's, it's, it's a real magicians thing. It's kind of like a pendulum like that too. Yeah, it's very common instead of A. I think it's like a new robotic control thing during that period where if you're going to do it, you're going to be doing it then and then, and then that kind of time policies and it just ends up being something that gets missed. A lot of magicians don't drink. Don't smoke. Penn had the strangest response when I asked him about that. He said, uh, I think we figured out everything we can from those things already.

Speaker 1:          01:12:57       But you have it. Yeah. You haven't, you, you've learned. We've learned everything we can learn from these psychedelic trips was with his perception was you. I don't know if he's amended that since then. This was over a decade ago. We had this conversation, but that thought process is fascinating to me because, uh, well, you mean you're talking about like this transformative experience that you've put through people through with these shows set and setting them up these, you know, they think the world is different and changed and then they changed because of that. I think what we're missing is, uh, is a, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:13:30       it's the, it's the experience of transcendence that's important. Yeah. Really, religions originally gave people that there was a time in history where were a religion was being born and it was giving people of phenomenal logical, embodied experience of the transcendent whatever that was, whatever that meant. And then time moves on and then that kind of moves out of living memory. And so you kind of have to need to recreate it, recreated feelings through practices. And then there's practices start to becoming a rituals and dogma. And by this point you're creating a sort of recreating a belief, but the sort of the embodied experiences sort of kind of faded into the background. And then, you know, I'm, I'm a, I'm an atheist, but that I could see that what you're left with thousands of years later is, is quite easy to knock down. Um, I'm kind of poke fun of.

Speaker 2:          01:14:22       But actually it's at some level, I think it's, it is not doing a very good job of pointing back to the original experience, the importance of transcendence. Now you can diy spiritualize that doesn't have to be about anything overtly spiritual, but like finding something bigger than yourself in life and throwing yourself into that thing is how we find meaning, right? Meaning trump's happiness or anything else. And that might be through your kids. And I guess this is why people generally sort of, we have kids at a certain point, you know, our ego gets to sort of step down, um, so that, you know, that that's. And if what we, what we do instead, I guess hence the interest in these dodgy Shamans, we just put it in all the wrong places, money, fame, and so on that don't supply it. They do not supply those feelings.

Speaker 2:          01:15:07       Transcendence, we think they will because we think, you know, rich and glamorous life will lift us up and out of our boring everyday lives, but of course you know, they don't work. There's something. There's something about that relationship to the mysterious that even even me as an atheist and the rest of it, I kind of. It's important. We have to have that somewhere. Someone realize that needs to be some kind of space for that. It doesn't need to be anything. I'm spiritual. It just is a kind of a respect for and understanding that serving something bigger than yourself, whatever, whatever that is and whoever knows is is a important part of being human.

Speaker 1:          01:15:44       I liked it. That keeps coming back to you. This recognition of your work as being something that's bigger than yourself. You pour yourself into this and through that experience you somehow transcend that. Something comes out of it, you, you, you, you grow with the creation of this thing in some way and while it's happening, you're about as alive as you can be. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:16:04       Me, well I'm, I'm happy if my breath is decent at four in the afternoon. I have very, very low ambitions with the business stuff, but it's. But it's for the, certainly for the guys going through it, other people going through it, I hope it gives them a profound and transformative experience for me. I, I get very, I get kind of a bit low if I'm not actively engaged in something creative so that, that, that is important for me, but I, you know, the painting or whatever. These are all things that you were referring to

Speaker 1:          01:16:39       to the painting and the exact same way. Something bigger than yourself. Yeah. Yeah. That's projects. Something to occupy your mind and your spirit and your creative juices.

Speaker 2:          01:16:49       Yeah. It's, that's, I think that's a really. It's a, it's a vital part of your life. Making sense of some, you know, the people sadly that throw themselves off buildings. It's not, they're unhappy. It's that they've normally, there's no meaning has gone that, that's, that's the real, that's the real killer is lack of meaning and we find meaning through throwing ourselves into something bigger and recognizing that. And you know, I think maybe the reason why this sort of work on myth and so on is he's sort of feeling like it's coming back into the back into the dialogue now is bs because it's something that's something kind of real brackets fictional to kind of, you know, to, to hang onto these. This is important. They are the I think are articulate. Something that's needs to be recognized and somehow honored within within life.

Speaker 1:          01:17:38       Do you know Tyson furious. He's a British heavyweight boxer who's the lineal heavyweight champion and he went through severe depression. He won the title from Vladimir Klitschko who had held it for many, many years and beat him and then felt like he accomplished his goals and just went into a real bad funk, gained a ton of weight, started drinking every night, carrying on and got suicidal and was thinking about driving his Ferrari into a bridge and then decided that he was going to make another run at the heavyweight championship. And so through all this depression and suicidal thoughts and all these different things, what turned him around was goal setting. The idea that he had something to work towards and something to live for, and then getting in shape and then forcing himself to be on this path, try to achieve that goal. Um, and then what happened if it takes place, didn't December first.

Speaker 1:          01:18:36       It hasn't happened yet. The rematch hasn't happened yet, but he's lost more than a hundred and 60 pounds. He's, he's slim and he looks fantastic and healthy and he was really fat and really large and very, very depressed. And now he's really happy and no medication. And that's the craziest thing about it is we're always searching for some pill that's going to fix, fix whatever weird, funky path the mind is on. But for him, what he found was that goal setting, like having something that you're striving towards working towards this danger is though what happens afterwards. It's exactly the danger because that's what he said. I asked him, I said, well, what if you win? What if you win the title? What if you fight deontay wilder and December first and you beat him and he become the championship? Uh, maybe I'll balloon back up to 400 pounds again and get depressed and I don't say that because I'm worried that he's being honest because he has been down that road before. But it's fascinating that he achieved real happiness from attempting to work towards these goals and building towards these goals and having this vision in his mind. I think a real thing happening. And

Speaker 2:          01:19:47       with Christianity that kind of exploded a relatively new idea onto the seat and a couple of thousand years ago, which to bear in mind. So prior to Christianity you kind of had the stoics, like for 500 years they were the, you know, the hugely popular philosophical school and they're all about bear in mind, they're also the first election from the east. So there's a kind of ideas around like non attachment and mindfulness that was sort of differently expressed in a much more western rational way. But they kind of reflect some of those ideas that were going on in Buddhism at the time. So the idea of happiness was very much about your relationship to the current moment and your emotional state in the in the moment, and then also stepping back from her whole life and it said you couldn't really judge anyone is happy until they're on their deathbed. And then what is, what is the story that emerged and what happened with Christianity is for the first time there was this, this new message that no, no, you suffer now and your reward will happen in the future.

Speaker 2:          01:20:51       And it's like, it's an amazing idea, particularly if you're suffering. And that was, you know, a time when there was hellenic walls and you know, it was a time of great suffering. So an amazingly powerful message. But like that idea of you can take that sort of spiritual ladder, that idea of sort of climbing towards your, sort of this shimmering golden haze of a, of a reward heaven, whatever it is off in the distance that's now the corporate ladder. Right? That idea that, that mode has, has stayed with us. We now, like in England, I, I'm not familiar enough with the school structure here, but in England when you're 16, you're choosing your a levels, right? Which is what you finished school with to then decide what you're going to major in at university in order to then what job you're going to get at the end of that to what promotion you could get and what you're going to work your way up to. I'm like, what is that moment? What is that point that it's that, that end. You know, we're so we are so fixated

Speaker 2:          01:21:49       on what's coming and I know this is in a way it's sort of like, well, this is familiar in terms of the importance of mindfulness and so on, but it also ties in with like a fear of death, death. Death is. It's interesting. Unpacking why deaths frightening because we're not going to be there when it happens and all those things, but it seems to be that it's frightening because our projects will end. You know, the, the, whether it's your kids or grandkids that you won't see grow up or what. There's always something that's going to come to an end and the the antidote to that seems to be just just reappraising that constant fixation on the end. So I'm on the, on the future, so that's why I'm, you know, I, I, I hear that and god, how, I mean, how amazing he is. Found that now, but I can't help but think and then one and then what, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:22:33       I couldn't agree more about this idea of working towards something when you're in school that you're, you're, you're, you're almost trying to reach an end that never comes. I mean you're, you're, you're building for something and also the pressure that they put on children to start that off at age 14, 15, 16, and to pick what you're going to be doing for the rest of your life and this idea that one day you're going to air quotes, make it and then you're going to make it and.

Speaker 2:          01:23:00       But if you did, you'd be like inferior in that situation now or that. This friend of mine I said built up the company and then sold it. It was depressed and had to go into depression at that that need the thing that has been driving it, that's still there and that needs someone to go and it's like you're much better off having something unfulfilled that at least is taken care of that need so you need. He needs something that's going to be perpetually a, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:23:22       rewarding, but patch stimulating, stimulating the human mind needs to engage in puzzles and and projects and creative endeavors and all sorts of different requirements that the mind has. I believe that mirror requirements that the body has. We think of the body having requirements like you need some daily exercise. You need good food. I think you need some mental exercise and I think you need knowledge. You need information, you need wisdom. You need that to to. You need inspiration and inspiration like when we're talking about all the different things that you can do to someone as a hypnotist or that you can do to someone when you're putting together these shows and changing their perspective on things through these transformative events. That's, in a lot of ways, it's a type of fuel for the mind and inspiration is a type of fuel for the amount, a great book. It's fuel for the mind, you know, um, even sometimes people mean this fast food culture that we live and we like it in a little tiny meme, a little inspirational meme on someone's instagram page says, oh, I like that. That's what I like, that it makes me feel good. It gives you a little bit of a, uh, some nutrition for your mind,

Speaker 2:          01:24:38       but at the same time is, it's squaring that with how

Speaker 2:          01:24:45       that life is, it's actually really ambiguous and complex and that's, that to me is the, that's the big thing to become, I think more conscious of what you'd love. It's probably the best we can really aim for us to become more conscious of, of the things that beset us because the stop around conscious of is the stuff that owns us. Yes. And the stuff that we're unwilling to acknowledge. Yeah. That's the stuff that comes back and bites us in the background constantly. Yes, absolutely. The model of I'm psycho psycho analysis. I love it as he talks about the god, so he was very interesting talking about like the, the, the, the Greek model of the gods because they didn't necessarily like worship the gods and believed that they were like real definitive in the way that we might talk about God now, but they, what they were doing was honoring these different, sort of like clusters of energy, like, like the god of Eros, like, so that's you, you honor Eros because it's important to honor the sort of, the erotic urge.

Speaker 2:          01:25:46       And if you don't, if you don't honor that, it's going to come back and get you. So the, the homophobic televangelists that gets caught in bed with some guy and at some massive scandal, it will come back and bite you. If you just want to bury something in you, it will come back and bite you. And I liked that, but it, it, it, it, it just means that it, you know, life is, I'm ambivalent and complex and I think the best we can do is, is try and be conscious of that and not be constantly reducing things to uh, so easy packages. But at the same time, how else do you navigate forward without, without reducing things to an easy story, that's the only way you can make sense and move forward is to, is to have an easy story. So it's, it's a, that's like a whole lifetimes, you know, preoccupation there.

Speaker 2:          01:26:31       Yeah, it is all messy. Yeah. We do love to similar things down to a nice tasty little easily digestible package, but the reality is when you open that package there, every package is intensely complex. Like every single situation has all these different interacting factors that led to that situation taking place. And if you take them all into consideration and really dwell on it, like you just get paralysis by analysis. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. But a consciousness is awareness is probably the most weekend we could aim for, at least in our own lives. God, you can only. You can only sort your own life out here. It probably also plays into hypnotic suggestibility in my own work, in terms of suggestibility, because we are, we're looking for direction, which is essentially that the simple message that easy message was. So we just kind of kind of wired to grab hold of that and absorb it.

Speaker 2:          01:27:29       Just kind of want to hit me. It's like a director of somebody giving you something you know you can hang onto when you're just kind of confused as sort of essentially I guess what, what suggestibility is your essentially confused and looking for an answer and at that moment someone is giving you the answer in the right way. But correct me if I'm wrong, there's no clear scientific understanding of what hypnosis is. It's not like there's like you can clearly show like this is what's happening and that's how it works and this is why it works. There is. I don't think there's an easy answer to that, but there is like a said, forget the hypnotist and the performers. There is a hole that big body of clinical work investigating it because it's clearly a thing yet suggestibility is part of the human experience, but as to what it is.

Speaker 2:          01:28:14       Well that's kind of. That is kind of the question because you can't ever quite climb inside a person's head and. No, but I like I, in one of the shows I did, I did a show where it took you Sirhan Sirhan who assassinated Bobby Kennedy. So he said he was hypnotized by the CIA. So it was like that. That's his story right now as a whole. He sets out how, uh, how that happened. So we took that said, well, let's, let's do it. Let's set up a and assassinations whether or not is it plausible, I mean, is if you take some of the tiniest possible, do you believe that we did it? We got a guy and the show starts with a big audience of people that are up for taking part. I find the most suggestible person in the audience. And by the end of it he finds himself in a packed theater.

Speaker 2:          01:29:01       Uh, no it doesn't. No, it's being filmed. He's got what he thinks is a real gun, which he thinks is a thing that is going to carry with them in a bit of filming is going to do later. But he has a real gun on him and we set off these little triggers in the same way. So has a hand said happened to him, right? So there's a girl with a Polka dot dress. Uh, there's a sound that he hears, which we had a someone's ringtone next to him. The little triggers that they had apparently implanted. What would you do? Would that guy. He has no idea. This is being filmed as know as part of the show isn't a packed theater. We've got Stephen Fry on stage, right? His, he's the guy that's going to get assassinated. So he's on it. He's wearing scrubs and everything.

Speaker 2:          01:29:35       He knows that he may get assassinated at some point during the show. Will the guy do it? And he does it right. He stands up and does it. He fires. What is a real gun? A weird, weird thing of expecting pandemonium from the audience. And there's that weird normalcy bias that kicks him enough. I just sat there thinking, is this part of the show? We had all these crowd control people and like nothing happened, but he did it like, you know, he uh, he shoots it. But that was good as I mentioned that because at the beginning of it we're doing these tests with a guy, um, and you know, the people in the room and sort of looking at what is, what is going on with it Moses. So we had this, we had an ice bath and I hypnotize him and told him under hypnosis he'd be able to come to begin the ice bath and you wouldn't feel the, the temperature.

Speaker 2:          01:30:20       And I had no idea if you would, because that's a real test. Like if he's just sort of playing along at some level, you're not gonna, you're not gonna get an ice bath like that. Even if it's even if there's some kind of physiological state you can tap into to make that possible that some people with training can do as a first time just step in and do it. He's gonna he's not gonna be able to do that. And I had these two clinical hypnotist with me. They hate actually might made a bet on whether or not you do it. They thought he wouldn't do it. I had no idea. And he did do it. And it really kind of, sort of three me, he was comfortable being in this ice bath and see the temperature. We had him kind of linked up to a thermograph thing.

Speaker 2:          01:31:00       We had to pull him out if he was at a certain temperature. I think if it got to whatever it was, 50, whatever that means we had to, we had to take him out. Um, you know, and that was, that was extraordinary. So although I think of it in very behavioral terms, I don't think of it as any kind of special. We had state. Then it's like, well then you know, what was, what was going on with that guy? Well it's, it's a physiological possibility that we can do that because somebody can do it through lots of training. So maybe it just kind of with this guy cut to the chase and he was able to just do it. But I don't know what the next guy do it. Probably not. I don't know. What about the, the ethical

Speaker 1:          01:31:36       complications that are involved in having a guy literally performed murder? I mean, he doesn't, he's not actually do because it's an actor. He doesn't, he doesn't know that he's not performing murder. He thinks he's a murderer and then you put it on television. Yeah. You have a murderer. Yeah, he's a murderer. I mean there's a,

Speaker 2:          01:31:59       there's a good kid that's a show where he is being like completely conditioned, but that's terrifying

Speaker 1:          01:32:06       that a, this is possible and they'd be to this person that has never experienced anything like that before. Finds out that it's possible for him and that he actually squeezes the trigger and watch a Stephen Fry fall to the ground. The squibs go off and he thinks he's a murder. And look, if you follow the logic that the FBI is used because the FBI has used similar logic to talk some pretty mentally challenged people into detonating fake bumps that were purchased from the FBI and those people are in jail for life. And this is a thing that happened in Dallas. There was a young man who was very suggestible and uh, he had some serious psychological problems probably. And he was a radical and he wanted to become some sort of a terrorist, whether it was al Qaeda or isis or whatever. And the FBI infiltrated this guy his life and set him up and got him, or whatever organization was with the CIA or FBI, they or they organize some sort of an artificial bomb. They got this bump to him, had him set up the bomb, and then gave him this ability to detonate it. He goes to detonate it and then they arrest him. So there was no bomb. The bomb didn't exist. They talked him into doing it

Speaker 2:          01:33:26       and they genuinely invested in many genuinely good,

Speaker 1:          01:33:28       genuine jail for live. They talked him into doing it. They provided him with the bond. The bumper didn't exist. It wasn't a real bomb. It wasn't going to kill anybody and they took this person and essentially did a version of what you did. But it wasn't funny.

Speaker 2:          01:33:48       It was. It wasn't for a television show, but through the same intent, through this guys are different intent. Hopefully. Well he might. For him, the intent was to kill

Speaker 1:          01:33:58       and the intent to kill Stephen Fry or the intent to kill innocent people. He was going to get with his bomb. Essentially. There were both talked into doing this. No real evidence that this guy would have ever done it without the FBI or CIA or whoever the fuck else it was.

Speaker 2:          01:34:13       Yeah, but if, if, if that had ended with them stepping in and going, okay, we're going to stop you here. This was an experiment. Yes, you've been conditioned to do this. We wanted to see if you would. You have done it and now he is a very careful and delicate dad thing to make sure you're okay. That would be a different story and somehow the ends would then it would be like a maybe even a fascinating and valuable thing to do if, if the guy was fine at the end of it and happy with it and it wasn't in jail, well that's kind of more of the world that we're in here and I'm not making a judgment on what you're doing. I think what you're doing is awesome, but I mean, I think it's fair. I think what they did is kind of fucked up and not just fucked up but crazy that this is a waste of resources. I mean, maybe I'm incorrect. Maybe this person on that path.

Speaker 1:          01:34:57       Anyway, and they recognized it and they stepped in, they said, listen, this guy is going to do something and we're going to help him because we need to get this guy off the streets, so let's show that he's capable of detonating a bomb and killing a bunch of civilians and will provide him with whatever he needs. Then we'll get them. Maybe they did it that way. I don't know. I don't really. You know, obviously I wasn't there when all this was going down, but it seems eerily parallel.

Speaker 2:          01:35:22       Yeah. Well, yeah. My, my, my concern is I guess what makes hopefully what makes this shows compelling, these sorts of questions, the sort of implications beyond a controlled thing with one guy who is fine.

Speaker 1:          01:35:35       Also it opens the door to the possibility that this has been done in the past was Manchurian candidate possibility. Yeah. Well, yeah, I perspective you must think it's possible. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:35:49       Well, I often making that show I sort of felt, well, that work, it doesn't mean that his story is true. Of course. It doesn't really necessarily have to relate to that at all, but.

Speaker 1:          01:35:59       But you did. It was kind of, it kind of works. It worked, yeah. Why did you write a book about happiness? I wrote a book about happiness because the,

Speaker 2:          01:36:11       that makes it really resonated with me. I was, I like, I, I studied law. I was supposed to be a lawyer and I uh, graduated and I kind of was living in Bristol, this lovely city in England and I'm making my living as a magician because that wasn't the hobby that I had started and I was just kind of thinking what I need to some point with this grow into a job. I don't know, but I know that my priorities are just kind of, I want my life. My Dad used to feel like this is good, everything's in the right place and this is kind of an enjoyable and worthwhile pastime and, or worthwhile existence. And I never really thought beyond that. So I've never had any kind of ambition, genuinely have any, any salt, which is why, you know, I haven't really, I'm not a whole goal setting thing particularly.

Speaker 2:          01:36:54       So. But the trouble with thinking like that as you grow up and become successful with what you do is you start to feel like a kid, like everyone else is a grownup and you're the kid and, and slightly embarrassed that you don't seem to care enough about the things that everybody else cares about. The businessy things and the viewing figures into this, I, my interest was genuinely am I enjoying what I'm doing and is it worthwhile? And then I read the stoics and although that's not like the central message, it's a big part of their, what they write about, you know, not, not trying to control things that are out of your control, not attaching yourself to things that leave you kind of emotionally vulnerable. Um, and you know, just your relationship with the present moment and so on. And it really resonated. So I, uh, I read it, I read a lot and it took me off into other directions that I started writing.

Speaker 2:          01:37:43       And I wrote this book on happiness after it took me three years to write it while I was on tour for three years. But blocks of blocks of writing, not like three solid years. It also, that meant by the end of it I kind of had and changed and felt differently and I think for anyone that knows about stoicism and it's so immensely valuable resource in terms of if what you want is a sense of feeling centered in a kind of emotional robustness in your life. And uh, you know, if you suffer from anxiety and so it's, it's, it's phenomenal. I think there where it, where it's slightly doesn't deliver is the importance of anxiety. It's all about avoiding anxiety. That their image of happiness was a sort of tranquility. Avoiding disturbance that actually cause disturbance is really important. Anxiety's important in life because how do you change?

Speaker 2:          01:38:27       How do you grow other than a. unless some anxiety triggers that you know, lets you know that something's wrong. If we just look for security all the time. And I say this because I know I'm like this, like this is my, my problem is that I'm too. I'm very good at avoiding stress, very good at avoiding anxiety. But the danger is, I don't know, am I going to grow or, you know, I'm just going to just be too comfortable. That's not, you know, there's not necessarily a good thing. Um, so, uh, so yeah, by the end of the book I was, I kind of could feel the edges of stoicism in terms of, uh, the importance of anxiety in a, not just living to comfortably, but it is a. and that's not, you know, they were movers and shakers, like there are people that changed the world.

Speaker 2:          01:39:10       Marcus Aurelius, greatest philosopher, king, an emperor most powerful man or ever was probably ruled the earth and was, uh, was, uh, one of the great stoics. So they're not like, it's not a recipe for complacency, which you can often sound like when you talk about this kind of tranquility and non attachment. But, uh, it is, it's, it's, uh, it's just, it's a very robust kind of language. They talk about being like a rock where the waves and lashing against you and I, I prefer the image of sort of don't. If you know Martha Nussbaum, who's an American philosophy, he writes a lot about these things, but she, she talks about being more porous, like a rock that the waves, the water can move through. And I think that's a more helpful image. I think that's a, that's a good way I think of stepping out into life is if you can have a, a sort of a robustness, but at the same time, that kind of uneasy porous relationship with what's going on that gives you that easier relationship to fate and fortune and all those things that they used to honor and recognize so much more than we do now because we don't read tragedy.

Speaker 2:          01:40:13       So we don't think in terms of those things. It's all just, you know, pride and Hubris now that they had lessons about back then and uh, you know, uh, uh, but I think that's a really. I think that's a, that's a good, that's a good starting point for life. So I wrote, I wrote this book happy it is. It's actually just become available in the, in the US on Amazon. I don't think you find it any bookshops, but um, because of the like I'm to hopefully doing a broadway show next year and these netflix specials and things that are, you know, so it, it is now available. Um, and uh, and ironically, the moment I finished writing it, I was out giving talks on happiness, feeling oddly sad and I couldn't work out why. And it was because this amazing three years writing project had ended and I realized, yeah, I. The importance of some kind of creative pursuit or something that brings you out of yourself is so important. That's fast.

Speaker 1:          01:40:59       Meaning that in the embracing of the anxiety of the difficulty of the task and finding upon it

Speaker 2:          01:41:07       completion, that you feel sad. That oddly a oddly sad. Well, it's kind of proof of concept that, right?

Speaker 1:          01:41:14       I mean, with what you're saying is like in this theme that you keep saying over and over again that putting yourself into something bigger than you, something, something that you're attempting to work through and that through this difficulty and all the struggle and trying to put this something you, you, you gained some sort of intangible benefit from them.

Speaker 2:          01:41:34       You feel like you, you seem like you're some of the. Seeks out those things. You seem like you've always immersed yourself fully and things that would, that would do that.

Speaker 1:          01:41:43       Yes. I'm a firm believer in the importance of difficult tasks. I think, uh, I think seeking comfort is one of the worst things a person can do in terms of achieving overall happiness. I think overall happiness, a lot of it comes through this amazing sense of wonder and the unknown and possibilities and working towards things with this embracing of having no idea how the, what the result is going to be. No idea where this is going to go and being genuinely nervous about it every step of the way.

Speaker 2:          01:42:17       And do you find that there's normally being, having the language for something means that it doesn't come naturally because if it, if that came entirely naturally are the things I'm saying, if they completely just, I'd always been like that. You wouldn't have the language because they'd just be entirely unconscious. So you found this is stuff that you've found and then learn to articulate, but because it does not, it's not an easy thing. It's not an not an intuitive thing that maybe life is, is essentially difficult. And these lovely happy moments we have are wonderful, but they're not the kind of. They're not the central force of life, which is that it is, it is difficult. I not. And if you want to philosophy of life, it has to work in those has to work at the difficult moments, isn't it? Otherwise it's not really. It's not really going to support you.

Speaker 1:          01:42:59       I think it's also the attitude in which you embrace those difficult moments and how you approach them. You know, if you, if you relish them and understand that there's going to be some genuine benefit from getting through these and whether it's a physical thing or a mental thing, whether it's a creative thing, whatever it is, as difficult, like just embrace this massive struggle and and enjoy this. Just the puzzle of it all, the, the, the, the majesty of the unknown, and then when you get through it on the other end, you get a different level of happiness. He had this powerful earned

Speaker 2:          01:43:34       because she's grown and grown and you've, you've moved forward and you don't, you don't, you don't cross the road on your own without having to let go of your mother's hand at some point something. Well, this is, this is the death and resurrection, isn't it? That's why these myths do have some resonance. Yes, something has die before something new, before something you can grow. You have to, something has to be let go of in order to step forward. So if you're going to grow, you have to, there has to be anxiety and disturbance and some kind of some sort of death in the metaphorical sense.

Speaker 1:          01:44:05       Yeah, that's tough. It doesn't come easily. No, it doesn't come easily, but that's also what's beautiful about it. If it just came easily, I don't think it would be appreciated. Exactly. You wouldn't be doing it and there's all this resistance to even engage in it in the first place. I mean, it's hard to write the first word of a book, right? The first word. Sometimes you just sit in there or anything you're trying to do, get it. The first step of a 10 mile run. All those things are the most difficult thing. Once you're. Once you're going, it's not nearly as hard. It's getting going. There's something about overcoming all this anticipation and all the weirdness of it all, you know, and then once you do it and you realize you can do it, it enriches you in all your future attempts. So something like you deciding to run a marathon would help you decide to write a book. Like all these different things are interconnected. The poet, a real random area, real cut talks about him

Speaker 2:          01:44:56       was loved this image of like some people live in a big room, some people live in a small room and some people just like just pace up and down by the window. Kind of write that. Although I do a lot with my life, but I think instinctively I'm the guy that's just sort of pacing up and down by the window. I'm instinctively how so in that I'm, I'm a little shy and I kind of. I'm very good at avoiding. I just think you're smart. To avoid

Speaker 1:          01:45:20       no shy is a lot of it is like, look, the interaction between human beings is so who knows what the fuck's going to happen? You know what I mean? You, you, you don't know how people are going to perceive you. There's potential bad feelings that could come with that is there's all sorts of weird social anxiety and social cues that you have to read and the complications of those. Make sure you get it right. Don't want to get it wrong. Don't want to be too rude, don't want to be too forward. Don't want to be too shy. Ramped up. It's A. I think it's the case with everybody. I mean the, the, the reason for shyness is there's a terrible feeling when you're rejected, you know, the meeting, someone who doesn't enjoy the way you've presented yourself as an awful feeling that will haunt you for hours if not days. Three in the morning I've had interactions with people and then two weeks later I'll be putting gas in my car. Just go, what did I say? Why did I say it like that? Like, who knows? Like that's all of that is there's a reason why people have some sort of a weird anxiety about interactions.

Speaker 2:          01:46:23       Also the stuff that, which is why that the difficulty is so worth embracing because if you can, if you can, if you can embrace it, that's where there is a kind of oddly sublime space because that, you know, that's the real stuff of life and that's the stuff that actually binds everyone together and that the, the, the happy moments. Well, they might just be happy because you know, she's great and wonderful, but you might just, you just haven't got all, got all the information at that point, right. That's kind of what's going on. So those, when we, when we, when we're embroiled in the difficulty, I think that's when we're most human and it doesn't necessarily make it any easier by its nature, but there is a real value to that. There's a level of growth and a kind of sort of just a voice somewhere in the background that these, or just as a note of this, this is, this is what binds everyone together.

Speaker 2:          01:47:20       And I think the, as you said, yeah, it's a better type of happiness, but it doesn't, it doesn't come easy. But I think life is about growing up is about tolerating ambiguity, isn't it more than more than anything. When we're infants we scream and someone comes in and gives us the thing that makes us feel good. And uh, there was a British and a child psychologist called a Donald Winnicott, who's sort of, kind of appeared after Freud and that there's a lot of, there was a lot of people felt so guilty and terrible after Freud was damaging the kids and he had this great message of light. You've actually what the mother or the principal caregiver needs to be as good enough. What she actually needs to do is to gently let down her infant, right? Because if you, uh, if you, if you just grow up thinking that every time you screamed, someone's going to give you what you want.

Speaker 2:          01:48:11       If you make enough fuss, you just get what you want. That's not a very healthy way of growing up into adult life or becoming a leader. Um, so instead what the, what your mother caregiver needs to do is to, is to let you down, is that needs to disillusion. You need to learn. Sometimes I scream and I won't get those things and that, that's okay. And you know, um, so likewise, you know, in life, like living with disillusionment is like, that's, that's, that's fine. That's how it is. And if we don't have that, if we live out this sort of fantasy that we owed, we're owed something should, why load, right? That the secret that I did at universities arranging itself around our banal hocking wishes or, and it's always like actresses and obviously, and the fact that she sort of says, oh, this all goes back to Plato. The, they couldn't have been any any further from the idea of a wandering all these kinds of material gains.

Speaker 1:          01:49:13       So it's fascinating how this subject repeats itself in some sort of a strange intermittent cycle where people start talking about manifesting things with your mind and put it in La. I don't know if that's a thing. Well, it's recently, it seems to be working its way back around again where it was. It was outside of the conversation for quite a long time. But now it seems to be coming back again where people are always looking for reasons why certain people are successful. And that's a big one. The big one is this, this idea that people can manifest things with their mind and you know, when it comes from, again discussing this with people who have become successful and they're looking for a reason as to why they're successful

Speaker 2:          01:49:55       and it's very hard to accredit luck would show it's in their success. Yeah, well it's an element analysis, the whole story, but the secret thing

Speaker 1:          01:50:07       and element, the power of positive thinking is an element. All these things are elements, but they're all combined with circumstance, luck, genetics, cultural interactions, the way human beings, they're just the time of the year you were born. You know what I mean? There's so many different factors. There's so many things that can lead to. I mean, and also where you're born. I mean you do where, where are you living? I mean all these things have a huge factor in your success. Try being a entrepreneur in Ethiopia. I mean, it's a different experience than being, you know, a, a, a tech startup guy in San Francisco. It's clearly one of them has an advantage and there's a lot of those things that play into each other and to say, well, you know, the guy in Ethiopia, he just wasn't thinking about it the right way. He didn't, he didn't, he didn't make a wish board and put his pictures of his, uh, his house was Ferrari in front of it or yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:51:03       whatever the fuck is trying to. It's, it's an, it's the infant's urge. It's screaming into the and the universe will provide if there's some way that the universe doesn't get, that should be our starting point of living, but surely the universe doesn't care.

Speaker 1:          01:51:18       What's the perspective enhancer? The universe in, in and of itself is a prospective enhancer minutes. If you can go somewhere in the country where there's no light pollution and see the Milky Way, you get this. Oh, okay. Okay. This is a lot bigger than I'm thinking. It's, I think it's one of the real problems that we have with our society with electrical lights that sort of blind out the stars.

Speaker 2:          01:51:42       We don't get humbled that the book I mentioned spell of the sensuous. This guy, David Abrams, who was out living in rural East Asia, he described at the very beginning, this amazing image. He was living in this hot and it was just, he wakes up in the middle of the night. There's any, just kind of, I guess being there for a night or two and he's in this patty field which has become drenched with water, with rain. He steps out and you have this incredible star filled clear sky, which is reflected. It's pitch black apart from that, right, so a star filled sky. It's reflected perfect like a, like a mirror in this drenched enormous battlefield that is this fireflies everywhere in between. Flying around, right? These little little specks of light and they had no sense of like what was up, what was down, which had totally disoriented. This feeling of just falling through space. It's a great opening to the book. Yeah. We don't get a lot of that. We don't get along.

Speaker 1:          01:52:43       We. We missed that part. Galactic part. We really do. It's so unfortunate. Whenever I'm out in the country and I look up, I see it. I go, Oh, I was in Utah a couple of months ago and it was, we were way in the mountains and it was. There was no light, just nothing, and you look up. It's just Phil Stars. Every inch of the sky had stars on it. It's just, it's. It's so humbling and I think it's such a powerful image for human beings and it's inspired so much, so much pondering throughout human history and so, so much philosophy and so much so much of the way people interpret our position in the universe is based on this image, this undeniable image of the cosmos that it's so magnificent and yet in our amazing technological society that we've created, we have a side effect and that side effect is light pollution. That light pollution has shut off one of the most magnificent inspirations that's available in the natural world. It's available to us every night. Instead, we block it out with fucking seven slash 11 lights and

Speaker 2:          01:54:00       and that in touch with that, not just, not just that, but the wider sense of the that the mystery that is represented by. Oh yeah. I don't know everything I'd done everything I know. Then sadly, what do we have? We have people like me have magicians doing tricks and psychic mediums. We're tending to connect with the dead. That's like our, our tawdry onset to the providing a sense of mystery there. Just hustlers. It's horrendous. I sat in a studio audience wants and uh, watching a psychic. It was one of those TV filmed ones where there's, where there's an audience was just like said before filming starts. He came out and he said, so is there anybody here that's hoping, you know, hoping that someone's going to come through and all these hands go up and he just asked people, so what are you hoping will come through?

Speaker 2:          01:54:49       Okay, what do they look like? Is there anything. Because I'll let you know if they come through. Is there anything I can ask? Any bit of information they could give me that nobody could possibly know that will prove to you it's them. Yes. Yes. He, he drowned and he was wearing a red sweater. Okay, well I'll let you know if he comes through and then they start filming and he just says all those things to them and uh, I think about the reason why that stuff is, is like people do believe it is that the lie is so ugly that it's so much easier to believe something amazing must be going on there. Then just is it, is it just that ugly, empathetic ally? It's such a, it was such a, it was such a horrible experience. So many of them them.

Speaker 1:          01:55:24       Yeah, I mean they have a television shows where there was a medium television show where this woman was connecting people with their dead relatives and it was so fake. They're just, the, the questions were shitty. It was so poorly thought out. It wasn't just a lie was a live vitally moron.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       That's a shame. That's the it. Oh, that was, I in one of my shows I had um, I got like 50 people up on stage had like a, like an audience thing set up on stage and I'm, we're doing medium shit with them and providing like, like very accurate information. But at the same time saying, I am, you know, I'm lying, right? You'll, your grandmother's telling me what, she's not telling me anything. I'm making this up, you understand? And then after the, so he's got to be. It was an interesting kind of like. Right, right, right. And then afterwards, I think it was the first night of doing the show, I went out the stage door and I was talking to people there and there was a girl who'd seen the show and she said, will you, um, I wonder if you could put me in touch with my dead grandmother? And I said, Oh God, well, I hope you understand from what I've just done that I don't, I'm not really doing it. That's kind of the point she had on. And I understand, I know you can't Redo it, but would you be able to put me into Jesus' eyes an amazing capacity for just this kind of dissonance?

Speaker 1:          01:56:38       Well, that's how cults work, right? I mean, that's the only way they can work. Once you get Ahold of the manuscript and you, you read whatever it was, whether it's mormonism and Joseph Campbell, the 14 year old boy who found golden tablets that contain the last work of Jesus, only he could read with his magic seers stone. If you, if you, you know, if you have any critical thinking left in you at all at that point, you just, you put the book down and go, what the fuck am I doing with my life? But people don't want that. They want, they want the, the, the universe is so open ended and the possibility of your, your existence expiring at any moment and you just vanishing into nothingness. And this consciousness which is literally stopping the lights go black. And that's it. It's so terrifying to us that we, we would prefer some nonsensical, unrealistic version of something but rigid. So we know how to follow it and a bunch of other people follow it as well. And we have this community of people that fall away and we gain comfort in that. And some very, very strange way.

Speaker 2:          01:57:44       There's a, um, that's sort of an for me and an unexpected, um,

Speaker 2:          01:57:50       comfort that comes with this sort of, the meaninglessness of it, which I've sort of recently kind of found that, that all of the people in your life and the people that like people that you work with and see a lot of, but that like annoy you and end up being like a cock, a constant source of niggling irritation like we, you know, we have people like that or people that we kind of admire or maybe you're a bit intimidated by or um, or like Fitch is going to be the peak. They were gonna, they're gonna be the people that just kind of populated your life at what point. And it will amount to no more than that, but there'll be, they'll be the people that were there and, and it's, it's hard to articulate, but it's, I find that like a,

Speaker 2:          01:58:32       it's a lot easier to kind of love. It's a lot easier to love when you realize that it isn't the end of the day. It's all. Yeah, none, none of that's gonna. None of going to matter. The, the, the, the guy that's annoying you everyday is these, that's going to be, that was that guy that was with you all your life. Kind of annoying, but that was one of the, one of these people and the puppet July. I find it a very, very powerful, uh, kind of just just reset in terms of sort of attitudes towards people that engender any kind of nervousness, irritation, intimidation, any of those things. It's like a, yeah, these are just, these are my sounds, but these are, these are, these are my fellow people, these will be the people that, these would be the characters that people that populated my life. And then that's kind of a nice thing.

Speaker 1:          01:59:19       So that makes sense. Does it, does. So in embracing data, there is no great grand meaning to it. All.

Speaker 2:          01:59:28       This sort of intimidation doesn't, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Their religious going through their own shared as well and I'm just a character in their lives, but that's kind of Nice that like, oh, this guy was, this person was with me every day. Or even that famous person that maybe I never even met, but like how weird that that was just like a force within my life at that person represented something, you know, these, these, uh, um, said it's just a lot easier to sort of go out in the world with love, which is ultimately what we need to try and do with that thought. I think

Speaker 1:          02:00:05       don't listen. That's a great attitude because anytime you can have less annoyance by a person who's just, whether they're ignorant or confused or agitated or whatever's causing them to behave in a way that's uncomfortable for you, anytime you can just sort of just, I Quito that and just sorta look, relax, and let it roll off you and just keep moving and go, uh, what are you going? Do you know what I mean? That's one less thing you have to wrestle with in your psyche. I mean, that's just, that's just a recipe for emotional success, period.

Speaker 2:          02:00:42       Yeah. Well, this, the stomach are there. If you could only control your thoughts and your actions. So powerful, isn't it? Anything else? What other people do where they think everything else outcomes are not under your, not under your control, so you can decide that those things are fine and that's such a, a like to really let that idea drop into the soul that, oh, it's fine. What if it's fine if my partner handles stress battling drives me and what if that's what did, that's, that's fine. Then I'd also, that allows me then to be a better partner and maybe be more helpful if I'm not internalizing it and making it all about me and you know, making it, making it worse. And again, it sounds like a recipe for complacency, but I like the tennis analogy, like, like so with success or with matters of social injustice where you think, well I need to, I need to go out and change that in the world is then it's like a game of tennis.

Speaker 2:          02:01:29       If you go into a game of tennis thinking, I must win. Then what happens when you start to lose, you become anxious. You don't play as well. You're trying to control something you can't. Whereas if you go into that same game thinking, I will play to the very best of my abilities. That's, that's on the line of your thoughts and your actions. That's something under your control and you'll play better. You'll get better results. That's, that's, uh, that's become a big thing for me. And when I get stressed about things, I find that something is really niggling away and bothering me that thought of like, hang on it's face because it's always fun. It's always something outside of the thoughts and actions. It's always something else and it is fine. It's normally just someone else's thing that is just the way they're manifesting. That is annoying. Maybe it's fine. It is fine. It feels like when I was a kid and I used to wake up on a Saturday morning and think I had to go to school and then realized I didn't. That kind of relief. I feel as an adult so much with this, that kind of thing. No, no, it's fine.

Speaker 1:          02:02:27       Think it's a complacency thing. You mean the idea is that you're, you're, you feared that this attitude would lead to complacency? I think it just leads to you picking your battles. Battles exactly. Which is important was your, your, your wisely allocating resources, right? You're not, you're not concentrating on some shit that you're not going to control anyway. You know, grabbing some guy you don't even know. Listen man, you gotta straighten your fucking life out. You're annoying and this is why. And like, that guy's not going to listen to you. It's just an ineffective way to interact with people. You're way better off going with this fucking guy and just keep moving so myself out sort myself out. And your reaction to him is the only thing that you could really control. Certainly can't control him, but you can control your reaction to them and there's some, there's a certain amount of pride in just being able to like whatever and just to a person or a thing or person's behavior that you might have been furious about just a few years ago or you know, or deeply irritated by where it would cling with you for days you'd be in your car or thinking about it like.

Speaker 1:          02:03:34       But the ability to just let that go or to even enjoy it, enjoy it, enjoy it,

Speaker 2:          02:03:41       it's good stuck advice which has come back now. It's such a, I think through CBT seemed to be the way that CBT, cbt, not a cock and bull torture the other one, cognitive behavioral therapy that may for all I know, both disciplines. Um, but yeah, the cognitive behavioral therapy is the kind of short form therapy that is essentially getting into the process of how an anxiety pattern might happen and kind of throw a spanner in that works and make people by being more, more aware of other possibilities that behavior kind of undoing it like that as opposed to the longer form of therapy of getting into a deeper dialogue with the self and tracing those things back to where they come from and so on. But it is the, uh, the founder of, uh, one of the founders of CBT was, was, um, was explicitly taking it from the stoics. There's a very, it's interesting how that, how that is coming back and I wonder, I wonder what it is, what it is in a culture that's now made us [inaudible] he was very, very popular now and there's that sort of awareness. It's a reaction against, against psychoanalysis. I suppose it's a yearning for shorter, quicker answers, which may be taps into this difficulty in tolerating ambivalence and complexity. Maybe a thing as a perfectly effective therapy for many things, but it's just interesting how it's coming. This stoic audio is cultural cycles of

Speaker 1:          02:05:10       sort of rediscovering things. Yeah, and I think um, I think that happens with A. I think it happens with Yoga. I think it happens with meditation. They become in vogue and then they sort of die out for awhile when a new generation sort of forgets it or doesn't learn, and then someone catches onto it 10, 15 years later and then it becomes very popular again. Then it's in articles and magazines. Then people started talking about it and then yeah, it's this weird thing that we do with that knowledge, you know what I mean? This is our version of oral history, we just pass things on and in this sort of a weird way where, you know, we, we forget that these are tools and then people start discussing their benefits and discussing the positive results they've had with it and then it sort of builds up.

Speaker 2:          02:05:55       It's a bit like the atheist argument thing I was saying, uh, as, as an atheist, but we hung up on the, knocking down the things that are actually just sign posts back to something that is important, is vital, but just very difficult to articulate. When Nisha said that God is dead, he meant that the sort of the young, the unknowable God is now dead because we were, now we've established this thing that we call God, which is just like the big guy and you know, we've, we've put like a box around it and gone. It's that. And in doing so, we've kind of lost that touch with that numinous unknowable thing, which irrespective of what you believe as like a religious believer, the represent something that unknowable force that, um, led even as a, you know, a hardheaded rationalist is sort of like there's a. yeah, you want to make, you want to honor that thing because we never, we need, we need to know what it is to step outside of ourselves.

Speaker 1:          02:07:01       Yeah, honor that thing is a great way to put it. I think. I think we have a really strong desire for some sort of a practice of humility and, and, and, and true all. And I would love to be if you could go back in time and interact with people where everyone believed in thor and Zeus and, and it would probably be absolutely fascinating to watch how these people live their lives with this undying faith in these deities were in control

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       of all the matters of the unit with no scientific knowledge at all. It must be amazing. And when you think about the fact that that was, I mean, what, how many thousands of years of human history people engaged with the universe like that? There's other things. There's only two, 300 years ago. It was only with the enlightenment that we dispensed with the humor, humoral theory of, of, um, of, of medicine, you know, we believed it was, you know, the fire and flame and all those, those kind of ethereal substances in the body that's like that. Then it was only at that point that medicine became something that was, could actually start to fight against death ward off death to which means death, you know, became the enemy. And that's what we start to lose. That kind of respectful, you know, death is some sort of companion rather than just some sort of stranger.

Speaker 2:          02:08:27       But that, that's, that's only, that's only a couple of hundred years ago. Um, so yeah, look, you know, I'm a huge fan of the enlightenment of course. And uh, as a magician of coals, you very quickly develop a love of a. well, certainly you did that at that skeptical attitude that magicians have had forever. And it's kind of debunking and so on. That was, that goes hand in hand debunking the, you know, the charlatans and the whole world of sort of spiritual nonsense. But, but that's, uh, that's sort of a separate thing. That's a different, that's a different thing. Um, and uh, again, I only can only articulate it at all because it doesn't, it doesn't come naturally, you know, I, um, it's, we, we find things that are sort of compelling because they don't come naturally do this. I, you know, I, I, I don't quite know what that means to me, but I think if I, if I knew too easily what it meant to me, it might have lost something in the mix, you know, I think that, I think the relationship to allowing your life to, to, to grow and to transform into whatever that means has to be surely are

Speaker 2:          02:09:40       Dr at some level. Otherwise we'd just pacing up and down by that window. Yeah. Otherwise, what are we doing? What are we doing, Darren? I don't know. I don't know.
