Speaker 1:          00:00:01       And Five, four, three, two. Yes. How are you sir? Good, thanks. Thanks for being here, man. Um, I wanted to ask you this because I was reading this today and I started to freak out a NASA is planning on drilling into yellowstone. Okay. To save the world. I didn't know about this. You know, about the relieving pressure. What are they doing? Yes. Yeah, there's the practice. We're talking about chiropractors for the startup folks. Uh, I think they plan on like a, you know how like if you have like a giant cyst and you sort of make a slice in it, you can kind of squeeze everything out of there. Let's see a doctor do that. I've seen doctors do that. I've never seen this. I do this. I have no idea NASA wants to send through. NASA wants to spend $3,000,000,000 drilling into a volcano to save the United States and a presumably a large chunk of the world to write because there would be some sort of a nuclear winter type scenario where the guys would be covered with.

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       This is not your area of expertise and sorry to throw this out, I wonder, I wonder about the providence of this, but you know, uh, these are things that, it's some people's areas of expertise, but no one has figured everything out, right? Like we don't know all the forces that are pushing around to make volcanoes and earthquakes, stuff like that. So back to that picture. Look at this picture. That picture freaks me out. I think it's realistic. Yeah. Every six to 800,000 years, that thing. Blow Sky High. Microsoft paint version of geophysics. Yeah. Yeah. It's from like a geocities site from 1994. Yeah. Well, here's the thing, they have to think about it, right? If he keeps this up close to you. Sure, yeah, yeah. Pull it. We, uh, there's all sorts of disasters that could happen to us that we don't really plan for because human lifetimes, a hundred years.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       Technology is a few hundred years, but maybe there are disasters that happen every thousand or 10,000 years and they could be very bad. I think solar flares are the one to really worry about it because that what you you're concerned with, it's not my pressure professional concern, but I was once sitting next to a hot shot lawyer who had just been finished a visiting Washington DC to campaign for. We got to start hardening up the electrical grid because one kind of solar flare that he says happens every thousand years could wipe out electricity in the United States or the world for weeks or months. Millions of people would die, right? So a few billion dollars and we can harden it and fix things, but who's going to spend a few billion dollars for something that happens once every thousand years? Isn't that the issue? It's like even with preventing asteroids or doing something to avoid collisions. It's right now we don't have an issue, so we have other things to worry about.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       We have a terrible president. We have a global warming. We have this, we have that. There's always something that keeps us from being rational about the future. Yeah, that's right. And with the good news with asteroids is that there's other good reasons to look at this guy and map things. Right. So the what astronomers are doing are piggybacking asteroid mapping strategies off of things they can actually get money for it. Right? Because yeah, no one is going to pony up that much money to look at the asteroid. Why would think that that would be like a really good use of money? Like let's, let's keep an eye on the rocks that might kill everything you would think that everyone would say for their retirement and so forth. Right. This avilia planning for the future, not what we have all four. Well that's a big ability.

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       I mean that's a big plan for the future that, I mean literally you're talking about like it wasn't there one that just whiz by that was three miles wide. Yeah. But was by means. It was something like eight times as far away as the moon. Was that what it was? Yeah. This is not. There's the chances of an asteroid even will be very bad. The chances of a bad one or are much smaller than some of these other thing. You don't come from me. Alright. For Comfort, I hear the truth is I take the comfort as you will, but isn't there like there's a lot of areas they can come from like behind the sun where the, the gravity of the sun sort of distorts the view. Not really high. They got to orbit, right? They can't stay behind the sun. They. Sorry. They can.

Speaker 1:          00:04:07       There are, there's what's called the garage point. There's a place exactly the opposite where the earth is going to have to hang out. If you were to be hidden from us for a long time and you can hang out there but you would never leave there. So there probably are some asteroids right opposite the earth, just like most planets have them. So they're just sort of orbiting. So what you're saying, yeah, they're opening once a year, a 180 degrees away from the earth and that's what they will be doing until they are possible. That one can come up and hit us from the bottom. And we're not looking. No, it's not. No Way. How's that? Now, part of the danger is something from far outside the distance holders that we just haven't just too far away to dim and it wouldn't come from like in where the South Pole is very roughly speaking.

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       We're looking at the whole sky, not just a, you know, you can see below the South Pole if you're in Chile, for example, with lots and lots of telescopes. That's where they have that. What is the, the giant one that they put in Chile recently that's not totally operational. Uh, yeah, there's, there's a whole generation of telescopes. I forget which one it is that's there yet, but one of them is it the giant Magellan telescope? Maybe essential one. I think they're just still working on it now and Chili's because it's because it's a high altitude and the environment is very flat and dry. Yeah. So I'm a Hawaii, he's not a good place to put telescopes, but that's gotten in trouble with a local resistance and astronomer is just not even trying to take that into consideration and therefore getting themselves in trouble. Canary Islands are okay. But uh, yeah, two ladies, one of the best places, Chilean Antarctica.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       Actually, I've been to the Keck observatory couple times. I've been three times and every time I go, the first time I nailed it and every time I've been since then I haven't gotten like, one time we went and I didn't plan for the moon and I was like, oh, there's too much moon out. And it was, it wasn't, it was just too bright. This guy was too bright. And then the next time unfortunately we got it when it was raining, kind of cloudy. We didn't get a good vision, but the first time, first time changed my life. I mean, I've really felt like I was on a spaceship looking through a window, you know, what they were observing, I don't know, but we were actually just at the visitor center, just looking at the visitor center to the sky is so magnificent at night, you know, there's no light pollution.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       They use diffused lighting on the island, you know, the whole deal. And um, the, the image that you got from just looking up, I mean, just with the naked eye, it's just spectacular. It's just an amazing view of the Milky Way, the telescope through there, right? Yeah, I think so, but it gives you a perspective that I think I think we're missing with our cities and I think we've done something amazing by creating these cities were, wow, you know, you just walk down the street and get some food delivered, you know, you can go get a car, you can, you know, go buy a TV. There's all this stuff and these congested areas. But in putting all this artificial light, we've removed our connection with the view of the cosmos. It's absolutely true. And I'm, I'm the biggest booster of cities. I love cities. I love living in them.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       I think that they're good for the planet, et Cetera. But uh, yeah, it does exactly like you said, it sort of makes our environment so artificial that we forget. Uh, I remember a great story a friend of mine told me she worked for an organization called project exploration, which is based in Chicago. They were devoted to bringing the wonders of science to kids and minorities and so forth, and they do these trips from Chicago on the train out to Montana to dig up dinosaur bones. Right. And so they are out there. They get to go on a ranch, they get to dig up real fossils, bring them back, and she said the thing that got them the most that was most effective to them was they saw stars for the first time in their lives. Right? They'd grown up in Chicago, they'd never seen a star in the sky.

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       And I think that's a shame. Yeah. You see these faint little flickering things you don't see like a full. The view of the Milky Way where you actually look up and you see that white sort of stripe across the sky and you realize, oh my God, that star. So those are all stars. The Milky Way is the best. I get dizzy looking at it. Right? Knowing that we're at the edge of this spinning disk whirling around, uh, and if you don't get vertigo, you're not doing it right. Yeah. As a person who studies space, do you ever take time to like go out into the desert and just to stare at the space with nothing out there? No light pollution that much, you know, honestly, the thing that I study are equations and formulas and theories and I use space. My friends who are observers go out there and collect the data and figure out what ideas we have are right and which ones are wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       And I'd love it when I get the chance, but I don't go out of my way anymore than anybody else. Um, you were saying that people were asking about general relativity. Was that the, uh, the quantum and quantum mechanics people on twitter say, all right, I hope to figure out quantum mechanics, but the first time here they look up to you for this. Yeah. Well the problem is not impossible. I don't think I'm just joking, but what? I'm very touchy, but it's one of those things where everyone is hoping that someone is going to be able to boil it down and simple. And Neil degrasse Tyson does a very good job of doing that with the cosmos. He's been able to boil down quite a few things on this show where a lot of people went, thanks man. Finally I kind of get it sorta yet.

Speaker 1:          00:09:09       He's fantastic. He has an amazing ability, especially off the cuff. He. Well, it seems like off the cuff I, I had this vision that he goes home every night and plans out answers to every possible question because there so slick when he delivers that does a little. Because I've heard him give the exact same semi off the cuff, but they're great. So it sounds like it's like a stand up comedian delivering a line. It's new to you. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So what is it about it that they don't understand? You think quantum mechanics? Uh, I think that's the subject of the next book that I'm writing a book I'm working on right now. So just starting thinking about it, but it's not just the people on the street, it's my professional colleagues with phds in physics who don't understand quantum mechanics. And rather than being embarrassed by that, you know, rather than thinking, wow, this is a terrible thing that we should devote all our resources to understanding, they flip it, they, it's like a aesop's Fox and the grapes, you know, the parable where the Fox is trying to get the grapes and you realize that he can't reach, reach them.

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       So he says, I never wanted them anyway. They're probably sour. Right? So that's a physicist. Or like with quantum mechanics, like now if you try to understand it at a deep level, they disrespect you. You're like, why are you wasting your time doing that when we could be calculating some numbers? Right. Ego and knowledge. It's always a weird combination. I would always, always. I've always assumed when I was younger that well, when you get to the highest levels of science or any sort of intellectual pursuit that the people that are really involved, there wouldn't be any ego issues. It would all, you know, as an outsider, I was like, well there's ego and every other part of the world. But those super smart dudes that are figuring everything out, they got all that stuff locked down. Kind of the opposite of that. Really, really, I love them.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       These are my people, you know, and uh, but, but it's, it's. Well, I'll explain quantum mechanics eventually, but please. But you are right. I mean the, I mean, sorry, the, this ego thing. I'm the. One of the thing about academia being a professor, right? Whether it's science or anything else, is that you are constantly being evaluated by every other person you meet. There's a hierarchy, there's a rank, how good you are at everything, right? And it's not written down necessarily. There's not a rankings that appeared in the sports pages, but everyone is judging you all the time and you know, my students and so forth, they say, well, I don't like to ask questions in a seminar because I worry that someone's going to be judging me. And all I can say is that yes, they are going to be judging you at the very, very, very, very tippy top.

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       Am I number two or number three? Right? And it's. Yeah, it's very sad and it's not, not everyone's like that, but a lot, most people in the field get to be like that and probably it helps forward the advance of science. Right? The competitive nature of it. It's competitive and egotistical and they want to do better than everybody else and prove that they're better and and I'm sure Einstein and Newton where justice driven by that is that anybody else? Isn't it weird? It seems like human beings need that comparative sort of competition thing going on in order to afford whatever they're doing. They need peers. They need some sort of. It helps it's there. Yeah. And we live in a world with scarce resources, right? Some of us are going to live longer than others. Some of us are going to get tenure and some of us are not.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       Some of us are gonna be Nobel Prize winners and some are not. So no matter what, there's going to be competition. Yeah. Yeah. And in your, in your field is there is a big issue, I guess with people disregarding other people's discoveries or wanting to rather like saying like wanting to poopoo things and I think this a very complicated issue that I don't really have clear because certainly scientists can be very, very supportive of each other under the right circumstances. Uh, but there are, there human beings, there's all sorts of cognitive biases that they have prejudices, basie and priors for what's likely to be true, what's not likely to be true. And it's not just perfect reasoning, perfect rationality, right? People come in with their prejudices and if you go and tickle their a preconceived notions, they'll think you're great. And if you say something that doesn't quite fit into what they're thinking about them, they'll sort of look somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       Your ministry, do you, um, do you teach this? When you're teaching classes and you're, you're addressing potential future cosmologists and quantum mechanics, quantum mechanics now committed. There's no person who does quantum physicist as good. Yeah. What do you, do you tell them about the potential pitfalls? Maybe plant a seed in their head like, hey, you can avoid this. You can still be competitive, but avoid all these traps that are essentially like these intellectual rabbit hole you can go down that are really not beneficial to anybody. Yeah, I mean if I'm formally teaching class and I'm standing up there in front of a lecture hall, a 98 percent is teaching the material pretty straightforwardly. I try to dribble in little words of wisdom here and there and especially if I think that there is a way that we always teach the subject that is wrong and wrongheaded and we should be doing it right.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       I tried to highlight the differences, but if I'm advising students like my graduate students or my undergraduates, then I, you know, lay on very hard the, uh, my own perspective on how it is to be a scientist and what is the good way to do and what's the bad way to do it. What are the pitfalls? And also just, you know, how to not make mistakes and trip up your own career. Yeah. That's critically important. Now, what is it about quantum mechanics that you think people don't understand? Well, yeah. Everyone agrees on what we don't understand this the thing that makes quantum mechanics, which is our single best theory of the universe in some sense, the thing that makes it difficult to understand is that as the only theory you've ever invented, where there is a difference between what the world is

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       and what we see. When we look at the world, right? In every other theory, if we look closely enough, we would see the world as it is, and quantum mechanics has this fundamental rule that says you can't see the world as it is you. If you have an electron, right, a particle that can be spinning clockwise or counterclockwise, you think that's what can happen, because every time you look at it and you say, is it spinning clockwise or spinning counterclockwise? You get one answer or the other, but the rules of quantum mechanics, I, when you're not looking at it, it's in a super position of both and you can calculate the probability that you're going to get one answer or the other and this drives people crazy because they think that what they see is what is real and therefore they have very, very difficult times figuring out how to make a sensible theory of quantum mechanics that explains what you actually see.

Speaker 3:          00:15:41       Yeah. Even you just explaining that. I'm circling around and signed my brain. I'm looking for like a Cabi to put place this. Where does this go? Superposition. What was he saying? He's saying that it's in two different places at the same time or that it's still an emotion at the same time. Good. Right, so that's right. So exactly what you're doing right now. You're saying that you know, there are things that it can be still in motion,

Speaker 2:          00:16:06       this place, that place and somehow it's in both at once or something like that. And with quantum mechanics says it's not an either. Like if you ask where's the position of the electron, there's no such thing as the position of the electron. If you look at the electron, you will see it in a position, but that is not the fundamental essence of the electron. There's something called the quantum state where the wave function, there's a mathematical way that we have representing the reality of it, but the answers that gives us two questions are just not here. It is. There has how fast it's moving, et cetera. That's not what we calculate using the theory.

Speaker 3:          00:16:43       Does this, is this sort of. I mean it's very bizarre. Right? And it's very complex. And is this sort of lend itself to get hijacked by Woo folks? Oh totally. Which is why like what the bleep, like the what the bleep do we know? That was when I first started really paying attention to this stuff and then I was reading criticisms of what the bleep and that's when I got an understanding like, oh, okay, well this is kind of horseshit and this lady is kind of a channeler. Yeah, like what? In a kind of a cult, sort of a deal. What? Wait a minute. Like when she was saying her name was ramp though, it was like that's her real name. Ten thousand year old warriors, you know that. How come they didn't put that in the movie? Like the. There's a lady in the movie, if you've seen what and so many people are in my God that changed my life and we were training because all of a sudden they thought that like magic was real and it is kind of right. I mean it's something magic, but magic. The world is not magic, but when you look at an atom and realize that most of it is space, like most of the things that we're looking at are mostly space and that subatomic particles really do kind of blink in and out of existence. You look at all the various quantum weirdness that is real and observable by people like you that actually studied this stuff. It looks crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:18:00       Yeah. In fact, so I hate to be that guy, but both the claim that atoms are mostly space and the claim, the particles pumping out of existence are both entirely bullshit. Oh, please educate me more. Why do people say that all the time then? Because they are privileging what you see when you look right. Privileging like white privilege or different. Exactly like that. Know they're there. They have a view of what should be. Okay, and so if you have an electron in an atom, we have a mathematical way of describing it and it's a cloud. It's not located anywhere. It's not empty space and here's the electron and most of the rest of it's empty. It's not like a little miniature version of the solar system. The solar system is mostly empty. There's empty space in between the planets and if you draw a picture of the atom or look at one from your high school science book and Adam looks just like the solar system, right?

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       Exactly. Is at the center and these things moving around it. That's not what it is. It's A. It's a smooth cloud that is everywhere inside the atom and that cloud is the answer to the question where I do look for the electron, where would I most likely see it? Okay, and so the leap that is very, very hard to make is what the electron truly is, is that cloud. It's not what you see. You never see the cloud. When you look at it, you see the electron position, but what it is is that cloud and people just can't. And so that's what they talk about. Particles popping in and out of existence. What there is is this wave function, this probability cloud that tells you how likely is it, you'll see a particle, and if the answer is, well, it's very unlikely. It's point zero, zero, one percent chance. If I look here and look here again, look here again. Then when you do see it, you're tempted to say, Aha, a particle has popped into existence. The reality is there was the cloud that was there all along. It was sitting there. It was not fluctuating, he was not changing, but it's not what you see. And everyone from Einstein on down has had a real tough time wrapping their heads around that. Yeah, I still don't get it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:00       So, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:20:02       so when people say that an atom is mostly empty space, it's not true. It's mostly this wave function for the electron. Yeah. So there's this sort of very difficult to describe property to it yet. And they were trying. So we are we looking at things sort of in a very material sense, like you know, this mug is ceramic, this table is wood, and we think about the composition of it. If we cut into the ceramic, we know what it looks like. So we're trying to apply those principles to like maybe an Adam. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 2:          00:20:33       They just don't apply because it's the other way around. Like we, we think that our world that we see every day is sort of basically how things work and we're going to sort of translate other extremes of existence into that language, whether it's far or way back in time. We're very, very small or whatever, but there's no reason to think that our everyday life experience has equipped us with the vocabulary to talk about these things in any sensible way and in fact it hasn't, so we have a very completely viable way of talking about the atom. We have very, very rigorous mathematical ways of describing what happens and then quantum mechanics says what you see when you look at the Adam is different and we just sit there and insist that what we see is the real way to talk about it. No matter how anti quantum mechanical that viewpoint really is.

Speaker 2:          00:21:21       That's got to be incredibly frustrating to you because I've heard like legitimate mainstream scientists on television talking about the Adam and describing it in that way. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I know. Believe me, and this is to be, to be super fair. People disagree. Okay. So I think that people disagree about what the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics is and I have no problem with that. I mean, I have a point of view and I actually believe in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and we can explain that and I think it was perfectly sensible and coherent and fits together. Uh, but if you have another point of view on quantum mechanics that is also perfectly sensible and coherent fits together, that's fine. We can disagree and we can ask about what experiments to do. The sad thing is that most physicists, especially ones that go on tv and talk about this stuff, just don't think about it that hard and therefore they're sloppy when they talk about it and therefore people come away going, oh, I don't really get it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:17       It's very gettable. It's totally understandable. Again, we can disagree about what the understanding will ultimately be, but physicists contribute just as much, you know, not on purpose, but they, they allow, they opened up the space for what the bleep do we know people to insert their woo in there because they're not doing a very good job of measuring up to the reality themselves. So it's, it seems like it's something that's intensely complex that almost needs to be described with mathematics, which would require you to have a deep understanding of mathematics to really completely grasp. Is that a fair assessment until my book comes out? Yeah, that's what it is. What is the book? Oh, well, so the title of the book is something deeply hidden. This is a phrase from Einstein and the idea is that there is something real that we can get a handle on is just different than what we see and I, I don't think that we need the mathematical details to get it right.

Speaker 2:          00:23:09       What we need is to have the willingness to let go of our intuition a little bit to, to, to accept the idea that the way the world works at a fundamental level is very different than the typical ideas about space and time and stuff that we are born with. Where were you when that, what the bleep moving was out where you were a professor yet? Uh, I think so. I, I lost a perspective girlfriend over that movie, like we met and we went on a date and she's like, I got the best movie for you to say I don't think I'm gonna like it. And she says, well, you got to be open minded gotta. At least watch it. I watched it. I was like, oh my goodness. Did you try to explain to her that it's not true? But there was, it was not a close call. It was not like, Oh, if I explained this, she'll get it. Is Love this movie

Speaker 3:          00:23:55       important. Right. And I have a friend. It was a really sad story. Um, I have a friend who was really into the secret and uh, she was actually a friend of a friend more than a friend and um, I ran into her at the comedy store and we were talking and she was explaining to me how she has sort of use the power of the secret to map out her life. And it was all gonna take place. Right. And I didn't see her again for like, like a year or so later, maybe more. And then the next time I saw her, she was like, I don't understand, you know, I, I really thought this was going to work and my life is still a mess and my dad is a loser and every guy date is a piece of shit. And it was just like, yeah. And she just couldn't, she couldn't get it right.

Speaker 3:          00:24:43       And she was convinced that this law of attraction, which in my eyes is very similar and a lot of ways, like the, the idea behind it is, look, you're taking a bunch of people that are extremely successful and you're asking them how'd you do it? And they're like, well, I visualize it. Holy Shit has got to be the answer. Right. No, that's, that's one part of a giant thing that makes someone successful. Yeah. And luck. Is it even bigger for a lot going on there? Yeah. Like did you imagine that you were born with two legs because some people aren't, right? Yeah. So when you deal with something like the secret or something like that, you know, the, uh, the rabbit hole, well, you know what the bleep, there's this desire that people have to find like some secret message, like there's, there's a, a magical quality to the world and all you have to do is think about it and look about it in a certain way and your life will take on this incredible quality. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:25:36       Yep. And I think that, uh, it's. So my last book, the big picture I actually devoted, even though it was mostly about physics and philosophy and cosmology and biology, I devoted a little bit to the fundamental principles of reasoning and especially basie and reasoning. I don't know if you've ever heard of basie and reasoning. I have. What would you describe it? Sure. I mean it's, it's basically the, the essence of it is the following idea. Someone tells you a good idea or do you come up with a good idea yourself? The usual thing that people will do is either say, that sounds right, it's true, or that sounds wrong. It's false. And what Phase II and reasoning says no to every possibility you say, okay, maybe it's true. Maybe it's false. I will assign a probability to it being true or false. It's called that the prior probability.

Speaker 2:          00:26:21       And then I will go collect data. I will say, well, what will the world be like if this were true? And then we'll go look right? Does this a woman over here like me? And she romantically attracted to me? Well maybe that would affect what she says. If I say hi to her and therefore I'm going to do the experiment. Right? And this is everything from going through your everyday life to being a professional scientist. So look fine. Read the secret. Be told that there's this law of attraction. If you understand how physics works, you know that it's completely nonsense. But if you were tempted to believe it, say to yourself, alright, let me test it. Let me figure out what, whether it's true or false by saying if it were true with the following, things would happen. If it were false, the following things would happen.

Speaker 2:          00:27:01       And that I think that everyone thinks they work that way, but almost no one really does. Yeah. It's very difficult. We have these preconceived notions that we really like to clean code. Yeah. We really like to imagine that we're right about things we hate to be wrong. And if you. Once you were on a path like I believe in this, it's super hard for people to shake that loose and people generally think that the probability that something is true is either zero or 100 percent. You don't like the idea that there's something as 70 percent true and therefore they can sort of improve that or deep or, or disprove that or whatever. It's just a, it's just hard going through life thinking about probability distributions for every possible version of reality. But that is the best way to do it if you can probability distributions.

Speaker 2:          00:27:44       Yeah. Is that what you do when you walked on the street? Oh yeah, totally. I long list of numbers in my head. I mean the good news is you. There is a certain threshold, right? If something is 99 percent true or 99 percent, 99 point nine, nine percent likely to be true, get on with your life. You just accept that as true and don't keep trying to come up. Come up with evidence for it against it, unless it's forced itself on you. Like a. When people say that the universe is not really expanding my, my field, I get this right, like we've had evidence since the 19 twenties. The universe is expanding well, who says it's not everyone who emails me every like I get emails and letters and they have their own theories and the light just got tired coming from these other galaxies that gets tired.

Speaker 2:          00:28:29       There's literally something called the tired light theory like fatigue. Yes, exactly. And I'm not, you know, so there's some version of the scientific method that says every idea should be treated seriously and you should sort of write down what the evidence for and against this is. But come on, I've done that. I know the universe is expanding. I'm not going to waste my time. That's okay. That's why we can get through our everyday lives perfectly well without being very good Bayesians at all. Have you had many flat earthers email you? I haven't had flat earthers email me. I did once tweet. I had one tweet mentioning the phrase flat earth and I did get an invitation to come on a podcast, a flat earth podcast. They have a flatter with podcast. I'm sure there's thousands, but uh, yeah, they are. They're out there. Where are they going to try to school? You, uh, you know, it was to their credit, it was quite polite and you know, we know you don't believe this, but let's come. Come on and have a conversation and we'll talk to you. And we're just about questioning things and getting at the truth and getting an education and actual astronomy or astrophysicist that the crucial thing that you notice whenever you talk to the many, many physics and astronomy crackpots out is that

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       they're never asking questions. They're always here. I will tell you the truth if you want to know it. They're never like helped me learn. Right? If people, if people email me and say, help me learn that, I'm usually very happy to converse with them one way or the other. Well, it's super easy to start questioning things, but it's very difficult to get a degree in astrophysics or to get a degree in astronomy or to really read books about it. Like I getting through Lawrence Krause's last book, man. There's chapters that I had to like go. Okay, let's go through this one more time. Like when he came here I had to ask him like one of the first things we did, it was probably a mistake because it's so complex. I tried to get him to explain gauge symmetry to me. Okay. Yeah. And it was just like he did it like two or three times.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       I'm like, okay, there's certain parts about it that are really hard. Yeah. Whereas we can try that again if you want, but it is. There are hard things. That's okay. You would be surprised if there weren't. Right. Like if you spend 500 years learning about the universe and everything made perfect sense the first time, that would be kind of remarkable. No, yeah, it's super complex and I, I guess that makes sense. It makes sense that it would be. Now when someone boils it down to something that's really woo woo, like, you know, what the bleep do we know, how is that frustrating to you? What does it mean? That must make you communicating with people that have seen that and have these ideas that are false assumptions based on it. Sort of like I said to you that atoms are mostly hollow. What does that frustrating?

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       I mean, what does that line gets frustrating at different levels? You know, I think, um, I, my first impulse is to be charmed and happy when people care, people are even interested on a very positive. Have you? Uh, yeah, like I first want to give people credit and see if there's something inside them with that we can work with and try to work toward the truth. Right? Um, but then, yeah, so, and I think most people maybe are like that and there's some hardcore people who have made up their minds about the craziness. I mean, you see where it would come from, right? Because quantum mechanics says what the world is is different than what we see when we look at it. So it's a small leap from that correct statement to we bring the world into existence by looking at it. Right. Then you're deepak chopra and DM me on twitter.

Speaker 1:          00:31:54       So whenever I tweet something about quantum mechanics, he retweets it with something. But it's all in your mind. It's all consciousness bringing the world into existence. He loves word Salad. Yeah. That guy is the biggest like dealer of worlds word salad. Yeah. The world is ever changing. This is putting them the word salad into a recipe that people think is nutritious for them. Right. They really liked to eat even though there's no actual nutritional value. Well there's, you get a lot of that from like certain yoga classes, like there's certain yoga classes that I go to where like the yoga teacher will start talking some woo woo shit and like you're being in the middle of the pose. And I'm like, what the fuck is this guy going on about the. I do it too. And as long as the pose is helping me, I'm going to put up with that smile my way through it, debate them

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       right in the middle of it. But it's weird that that stuff is all can sign up. That's all sort of kind of in that sort of genre of people that are trying to improve their life or be spiritual or they love that deep rock show up or shit. Like I've had the, I had this conversation with a friend of mine who's like, it gave me a Deepak Chopra book and I started going through it. Now was like, I go, you know, this guy's crazy, right? Probably wants to do well, it's probably not a terrible person probably wants to do well. But he's also ignoring the actual scientists that study all this stuff and he, he's sort of pitching this thing that what it is like this Deepak Chopra ism this sort of like spiritual pseudo spiritual view of the world that he's pitching to like, uh, these, these middle aged housewives.

Speaker 3:          00:33:30       They're like looking for some sort of meaning to life, but they don't like going to church. Yeah. And Daniel Dennett, the philosopher, came up with a great word for it. He calls them deep at ease. When you string some words together in a way that sounds extremely profound, but you look closely at it, it doesn't actually mean anything at all. You know there's a website that will do that for you. How the Deepak Chopra quote general. That's it. It's not that hard. I would like to laugh at. There's another website that comes up with brandon physics, paper titles. It's not that day. Not that different. Usually tell when it's a random visitor, but the physics stuff is. It's almost be I guess, similar issues with the reason why deep bra can do that is because most people don't understand what he's talking about. So if you say a lot of stuff about things that people don't understand like I've had, we've.

Speaker 3:          00:34:15       There's been a bunch of videos that we played on this podcast about a fake martial arts practitioners. There's a whole business and these people that have these fake martial arts techniques and they use all these huge words that are rare, very rare about the central nervous system and about the, you know, the structure of the body and they'll, they'll use all this stuff to try to get you to think like, oh, well this guy, obviously it's an enormous vocabulary and a deep understanding of anatomy. He must therefore be this she master that he's pretending to be and it's kind of very similar. So I kind of recognize that pattern in the EU. People like, oh, I kind of see what you're doing. You're throwing a bunch of very complicated word that aren't in most people's vernacular and you're saying them in a way that makes me feel like you have some sort of a connection to the CI and to the shock rose into the inner whatever that everybody's trying to reach to be happy. Yeah, and another problem is just that whenever there is a field, whether it's physics or medicine or whatever, where we know something, but it's hard, complicated, counter intuitive. When we explained that we translate it right, you know, in physics we have mathematical equations that are quite an ambiguous as to what they say, but then we use words, we say, well there's a cloud, there's a probability, etc. And every translation is inaccurate in some sense. So if you're bAsing beliefs off the translations,

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       then you can fudge them a little bit more to get almost wherever you want to go. Oh, you're confused me more. I was good with the cloud up until now. Why? Why? Why is it a cloud like why? When you describing where the electron in habits, why is it a cloud? Well, it's if you're thinking about the electron, the, the, what the wave function is sort of how we use it is you asked the question, if I were to look for the location of the electron, there's a machine that tells me the answer, the probability of seeing it here with a certain number of probability of seeing it, their probability, seeing it somewhere else. And so at every point in space there's a number, the probability you will see the electron there, right? So if you visualize all those probabilities all at once, it looks like a cloud that is filling up all of space and then the leap is to say there's no such thing as where the electron is. There'S only the cloud. it's not like the cloud is expressing your ignorance of where the electron really is. The cloud is what there really is.

Speaker 1:          00:36:42       And I sound exactly like deepak chopra or there's no way. No, no. You don't bore versus electron cloud. Oh yeah. Here we go. Visualization of it. It is. That's right. Yeah. So on the left, these are. This is the picture we like to draw electrons orbiting around as if they were little planets in the solar system on the right is closer to reality, but you see even there they couldn't quite resist the temptation to make it point to list and little dots and it's really should be some smooth distribution. This is what the, the physicist would call the thing on the right, the wave function or the quantum state of the electron and it is that cloud and it answers the question. What's the likelihood that we see it in different places? The hard part to mentally get to is the cloud is what is real, is it almost like, like what, what we're looking at here with all these dots here and it says jamie would go back to where it wasn't pleased, um, where it says the probability of the density of electron and then you see all those dots is the issue like making a visual representation of it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:47       Almost like, like if I asked someone to draw a visual representation of a thought. Yeah, it's something like that. Exactly. Because we're used to stuff, coffee cups, bottles of water, and like they have locations in space. They have a shape, a size thoughts. Yeah, exactly. But it's hard to draw them. Right? Where's that going? Where the hell is that? I mean, that's the most important thing that we've ever had when it comes to the creation of civilization, inventions, innovation, creativity, all those things are just thoughts and try, draw thought. Right? But when you were intuitive, we're, we, we get that. You mean when you say he's hard to draw a song, right? But okay. No, what it is you can draw the musical notes and then. But uh, yeah, and so if you talk about an electron that's supposed to be a thing I was supposed to be somewhere that I can like find it and someone comes along and says, no nature is totally different than that and you will never in your life be able to see with perfectly clear eyeglasses what nature is really like.

Speaker 1:          00:38:50       They get a little annoyed, but it's the truth. What do you think about the very uber bizarre theory that the universe is incredibly fractal in the sense that what we're looking at when we're looking at the universe is essentially some sort of subatomic particles for a much larger adam and then it goes bigger and bigger and then there's a human out there. I think also a part of another galaxy that's also part of another universe. It's also part of another atom. That's also right. No, I get it, but no, I think no, the closest thing that is a little bit more reasonable to that. well, so let's go the other way around. Yeah. Um, well let me ask me or let me ask you, why is it no. Well, so let's go the other way around. Okay. Let's, let's, let's ask if maybe what we think of as adams could be alive with like little people and substructure that we just don't know about.

Speaker 1:          00:39:40       So if you're an honest, conscientious scientists, you always say we don't know for sure. Right? But what we, everything that we think we know about quantum mechanics says that things like electrons and quarks are completely featureless. That if yOu tried to put little wrinkles and make them different, like the earth and venus and mars are very different from each other. Every electron is exactly the same as every other electronic. And if you tried to give it any distinguishing features, it would cost an enormous amount of energy. Energy that's just not there, so there's fundamental principles of physics that says that there are no people living on adam's okay, and so what we're like with our solar system, even though it kind of vaguely resembles and adam in some sense, we are nothing like real adams. We could not be patched together to make a solid object in this bigger world or anything like that.

Speaker 1:          00:40:27       So the. So our exIstence sufficiently different from the summit atomic realm that I see no way that we could be the same thing as the subatomic realm to some bigger people. I do think we could be living in a simulation as elon musk famously a suggested. We could be all living in a computer simulation. I don't think it's likely, but it's completely plausible given what we know right now. Right? The real issue is that one day we most likely will have something as long as technology continues to exponentially advanced, will one day have something that's indiscernible from the reality, there'll be able to interface more than likely to be able to interface with your senses, with the way the mind perceives reality and create something that passes that uncanny valley and literally feels like like real life matrix. I think that we might be very far or we might be pretty close. I think it's hard to tell because there's so much We don't know right now. It's not like this is coming in the next 10 years, but it could be a thousand, but yeah, absolutely. It could. You know the thought experiment that that helps people accept this is you know, a single neuron in your brain, you have something like 100 billion neurons in your, but every

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       single one is not that complicated. It takes in some inputs, outputs in some outputs. It might be work to figure out exactly what it does, but it's not mysterious. Right? So We couldn't imagine replacing one neuron in your brain with a solid state micro, a device that does exactly the same thing as that neuron, and you will be the same person roughly speaking, right? So, okay, so if you believe that, then do that With 202 neurons and do it with three neurons and you're gradually building up who you are, but just replacing your brain with something that is a machine made and if you believe that can happen, there's no reason to think that machines can't be as human as we want them to be. do you follow any ray kurzweil stuff? A little bit. I don't think that, uh, he's and especially deep thinker, but he's a good one.

Speaker 3:          00:42:20       How are you counting on his desk? I could be this mother fucker. you don't think he's an deep thinker. I mean, he's a brilliant guys. Invented a bunch of really fascinating things.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       Yeah. He likes to extrapolate without, uh, without limit pretty fearlessly. Well, he must have irritated you for you to jump right out with. I don't think he's a particularly deep thinker. No, but I do think he serves a role. I think there are people who, uh, make us think more deeply. Like I remember seeing a panel discussion with, uh, murray gilman, who was a famous physicist and isaac asimov. This was like 30 years ago when, uh, as well as still alive. And there was some, someone else who's on the panel, I forget, it was another physicist. And the amazing thing was the science fiction author was by far the most conservative thinker up there in terms of what he thought would really be happening a thousand years from now. Right? The physicist had these Way out ideas and asthma was like, yeah, I don't think it's going to be all that different. Right? And it's just hard to predict the future accurately. And there's a role serve both by trying to be as realistic as possible and, and careful and basie and saying what are the probabilities? And so forth. There's another role served by just being the, a provocative in saying, well, maybe this crazy thing is going to happen. Maybe we'll cure death in the next hundred years. And a light bulb change for everybody dramatically. That seems fairly likely, right? They'll to figure out some way to reverse aging. Yeah. I think that's plausible. There's no biological reason why not.

Speaker 3:          00:43:49       Kurzweil's got some weird motivations to. he literally wants to sort of rebuild his father. Yeah. Yeah. He wants to be able to piece together some sort of an artificial intelligence version of his father and go back and see him. Yep. that's deep. That's a word for it. Yeah. He, he thinks that there's gonna come a time, uh, inside his lifetime hopefully, that you'll be able to download consciousness, that consciousness is going to be something you, you'll transfer sort of like a code. Yeah. I think that there's, there's a difference between, you know, what is potentially

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       given arbitrary amounts of time and resources and what is realistic in the relatively near term. By the near term we mean 50 or a hundred years. Right. And I think that people like ray kurzweil are far a exaggerating what's going to be possible the next 50 or 100 years because they underestimate how little we know about how the brain works, how important it is for the brain bring to be in our bodies, right? We, one of the, one of the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence over the last couple of decades was to realize that if you try to build an artificial intelligence computer, it's, it becomes much more realistic if you give it a body, if you give it a face and it can interact with people. I mean we underestimate the extent to which having a body is an important part of how we think and who we are.

Speaker 2:          00:45:14       And these, this is just like such baby steps and understanding this stuff that to imagine that in the matter of decades we'll have it all figured out and have downloadable consciousnesses is not realistic to me. Do you think that we have to absolutely understand the exact way that the human brain works in order to replicate its possibilities? No. I mean, I think that uh, we probably won't step, probably won't be the way that we make artificial consciousness or artificial intelligence, like we won't just be reconstructing human beings. Like when we made cars, we didn't reconstruct horses. Right. We just did it in a very, very different way in cars are much better than horses and in various ways not as good in other ways like going on the hills, going up hills. But also, you know, in the early days of cars, one big complaint was. But if I'm drunk and passed out, it won't take me home.

Speaker 2:          00:46:03       I'll buy. Does that a complaint? That was a complaint. Hilarious. Because the horse had just take you home and knows how to get there. Exactly. Finally, we'll get the artificial and nobody gets mad. Self driving cars will be able to do it. Finally, if you're driving a horse drunk, nobody gives a shit. No, you're passed out. That's right. Yeah. That'd be like a big adjustment for people. Yeah, exactly. More trunk. And so the idea that the way that will make artificial intelligence is just sort of mimic a human being is just crazy. That's not how it's going to be. What do you think it's gonna be like, well, I don't know. There are. There are problems that can be solved by things that we design or just a different set of problems than the thing that evolution naturally made us do. Right? Like evolution built a very, very general purpose machine that is inefficient and irrational and all sorts of ways like anyone's pocket calculator since the 19 seventies can multiply numbers way better than your brain can write.

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       Your brain has enormously more computational capacity than a pocket calculator. Why can't we multiply numbers? That ability was not important back when we were evolving these things. Right? So the set of things that it is easy to design is just very, very different than what the brain does. So who knows? I don't know exactly what it will be, what it will look like. I actually think that the more important thing we'll be blurring the distinction between human beings and machines. You know the, the crossovers. This is another one of elon musk's project is called the neuro link. The idea of basically a neural lace, something that is just interfacing your brain very,

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       very, very fast so that you have access to the entire internet or whatever peripherals you want in real time. So wikipedia is part of your memory essentially, and that's just who you are and how you walk around and you can multiply numbers as fast as you want to. That seems very likely that augmented, augmented reality. Yeah. Yeah. And some sort of a weird symbiotic connection to the net into the electronics, whether it's a wearable thing or maybe even an embedded thing. Yeah, that's. I think it will be embedded. So yeah, this is more efficient. We use. We will you be one of the first adopters? Are you gonna wait a little while. I'm never a first generation adopt or even have iphones much less, you know, things embedded in my body. But look, I just adopted two kittens. They get microchip implants. Oh yeah. You adopt a cat that gets a microchip inside so you can't lose it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       Yeah. And so to think that we're very far away from doing that, I don't think is right. I think that we're going to be doing things. I was just looking at a a laptop bag. It's a laptop bag that also is a. You have a passport bag and a laptop bag and then a carry on and then a check and sto for airport airplane luggage and all of it is bluetooth and all of it is location coordinated with gps so that if somehow or another your bag gets lost, you literally can go on a computer and I'll show you where your bag is. Like, whoa, how long are we going? When are we going to do that with people and I feel, you know, I, I'm a big believer in privacy rights and so forth. Her dilemma, do I let my employer microchipping what does this.

Speaker 1:          00:49:01       There you go. There's a company in Wisconsin that had microchip day on August 1st and they implanted microchips and people first of all, that dude with his ears in that, those fucking earplugs and the lower ear lobe thing. You ain't doing nothing buddy. Sticking that in me. Look what you've done in your ears. Fellow Wisconsin company becomes first us employee. What, and these are very simple, just location tracking things. Right? Why would you allow the company to do that? I wouldn't allow my company to tattoo me. Why would I allow my company to microchip? It's for tracking and you can also like they can buy stuff in the cafeteria and one, you know what else you could do use your wallet. You say that, but you know, do you turn off all cookies when you have your laptop on and your browser. So I do know.

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       No I don't because it's convenient and these guys they like, they get, they can buy their snacks with their microchip. Well wasn't the machine and get a snack, but here's where therefore separation every last this laptop I can go like that and then I could walk out the door on that laptop stays here and all the cookies and all my browser history stays here. It doesn't. It's not an estimate. They want you to think now you're freaking me out. Another thing I wanted to talk to you about with quantum mechanics that came out of that movie, what the bleep. That was very confusing to a lot of people was the whole observer effect. Now that is something that I've tried to explain to people that the issue is, well please, if you could explaIn it like this is the thing is that people believe that in quantum physics it's been proven that if you look at things that you looking at things changes those things, but the way it's been described to me, it's like, no, it's actually because you are measuring those things and that's what changes it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       The act of measuring in. Yeah, and that there's some sort of physical interaction when you're measuring something. That's what's changing the effect. Is that correct? Yeah, I think that's right. The this is a legacy of the battle days of quantum mechanics. When people were a little bit fuzzy about these things, it was better at it. The bad old days like battle rap, battle days maybe like see einstein and bohr going at it, rap battle, the bad old days when people had a more limited understanding of what quantum mechanics really is and spoke about it and slightly sloppy ways, so there is the truth that if you want to describe what you see when you look at an electron, what you see is different than what it is like you. You do change it by looking at it and therefore back in the battle days, a lot of people wondered whether there was something special about consciousness or human perception or something that was helping us explain the laws of quantum mechanics.

Speaker 1:          00:51:45       So as you are pointing toward no, the answer's no. There's nothing special about quantum mechanics and consciousness in any way. A rock could do the same thing or a video camera or a speck of dust. The the quantum mechanics rules says that things change when systems interact with each other. The way that you described the system is different when it's all by itself. Then when it interacts in some interesting way with some other system and that system can be a person, but it can be anything else also. So in that famous experiment that's in that cartoon that gets passed around by people every two or three years when they're like, wow, the world's made the magic and they pass this around. It's usually a yoga teacher. They, um, that, that shows that the, you know, there's the particles in the waves. Indeed. Do you remember the saving and funding?

Speaker 1:          00:52:32       I know it's dr quantum when we get in trouble playing that be maybe for shitting on it, we will get mad at us. We might get pulled, we get pulled from you had a good run. What people, you know, they own these videos and so it's a real issue is wildlife videos. Those suckers, they're, they're so quick to pull the trigger and you know, they have a claim. It's their video. So if you use working together. Yeah. So if you use it in mock, whatever is happening, or even if you tell them, hey, go watch this video, it's on youtube, here's the name of it, right? You would think that'd be like good advertising, but no, get here. I'll bring it up and I can. We can like talk about it a little bit. Okay. So give, give me some volume so I could hear what they say. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. The double slit experiment, right see is similar to

Speaker 4:          00:53:25       the line. The marbles make bar when we add the second slip, something different. If the top of one wave meets the bottom of another way, they cancel each other out. So now there is an interference pattern on the back wall. Places where the two tops meet are the highest intensity. The bright lines and where they cancel there is nothing. So when we throw things that is matter through two slits, we get this two vans and hits and with waves we get an interference pattern of many bands. Good so far. Now let's go quantum. So now you're going to freak out. This is where you start getting mad quantum quantum, I know, tiny, tiny bit of matter, like a tiny marble fire street already shaking his head folks. It's not a tiny marbles.

Speaker 2:          00:54:36       You got to do a little bit of commentary on we can't just play the whole video. I can do the gun. I know exactly what they're talking about. That's very famous experiment. So yeah, so if you have two slits that you let marbles go through, they get two slits in the receiving screen on the other side, right. Whereas if you let a wave go through two slits, you get this interference pattern. Right? And so what happens when you let an electron go through? The answer is you get an interference pattern. It's more like a wave than a particle, but the real weird thing that they're going to get to eventually is if you have. If you let an electron go through two slits, but you put little detectors on the slits, so you say which detect which slit did the electron go through. Then it always says it goes through one or the other.

Speaker 2:          00:55:22       It never goes through both. And the interference pattern on the other side disappears. You only see the two lines that you would have seen if they were marble link. So the point is when you're not looking, the electron is acting like a wave and when you're look at it, the electron acts like a particle. That is the lesson of the double slit experiment. Right? Why? Why? Because when you put that detector on the slits, you interacted with the electron and you localized it, right? There was no such thing as the position of the electron. There was no such thing as the answer to the question. Did it go through one slit or the other? There was only a cloud. There's only a wave going through, but you affected it or whatever the detector was affected it. When it looked through the slits to see did it go through this one or this one and that affect changed it from being going through both lists to being only going through one and how does it affect it like that?

Speaker 2:          00:56:16       Well, there's this what, what's called quantum entanglement. The detector becomes entangled with the electron and this is where you get into what I my favorite version of quantum mechanics, which is the many worlds interpretation. The the right wAy to think about the electron was that cloud, that wave going through. That's the natural thing. The weird thing is that when you look at the different slits, you only see it go through one or the other and it acts like a particle. So how do you explain that? So in other words, our natural intuitive way of thinking about electrons is as particles. Little marbles and quantum mechanics says, no, no, no. It's naturally a wave. The weird thing is when it acts like a particle and if you are many worlds person, what the answer you give is the following. When you look to see to the electron go through one slit or the other you or whatever video camera you had or whatever becomes entangled with the electron and what that means is that the wave function of the whole universe, the wave function of both the electron but also your camera and you and the stars and galaxies and so forth splits into and there is now one branch of the wave function which which acts like its own separate world which says the electron went through the left slit and your cameras saw it go through the left slit and it made a little line on the other side and there's another branch which says the electron went through the right slipped and your cameras, so it goes through the rites lit and it makes a line on the other side and so they're both still there, but the world split into and now you're only in one of them.

Speaker 2:          00:57:44       You don't see the whole world anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:57:47       You managed to make it more confusing. Congratulations. Screwed my head up even more. I did that. I understand it. The less, now that's even more baffling, but the bit you understand is actually true. That's true. Well, it's a little illusion of understanding doesn't count. Oh, okay. So by not understanding, I understand more. There you go. Boy, you have a weird job. A very, very weird job. Well, it, I, I get it now though in talking to you, why, you know, you have the deepak chopra's of the world and why you have the, what the bleeps because it's so intensely confusing. Yeah. And especially with the limitations of language of just counter intuitive, it's against every little bit of our everyday experience. It's a set of concepts that were not equipped with that. We're not born with that we have to struggle to get into our heads over many, many years. And it shouldn't be surprising. So you as an educator, when you were talking to people about this, it's obviously you've probably done this thousands of times, right? And tried to have theSe kind of weird conversations with people like myself. That's sort of lack the tools to really truly understand what you're saying. Um, what, what does that mean? It's got to be frustrating in a sense or no, I love it. Yeah, you do. Yeah, I do. Yeah, that's correct. Because what a great attitude

Speaker 2:          00:59:09       I was there. That used to be me, like it's not like my brain was born ready to understand quantum mechanics. Uh, I worked at it and struggled with it and got it wrong. And who knows, maybe 10 years from now will think, oh, you're so stupid 10 years ago. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       But I think that it can be understood. I think that people who wants to try to understand it a number one are already 90 percent of the way to being awesome. And number two, the remaining 10 percent is very, very achievable. It is understandable. Wasn't it fireman that said, if you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics. Uh, he said something like that. He said he can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics, which is fine, except that you should therefore be outraged. You should not be proud of that. He was kind of a funny guy. Oh yeah. He's being funny. And I think that it's certainly true that we don't understand quantum mechanics, if I understand, you mean both understand and everyone else agrees that you understand. Maybe someone understands it, but certainly there's no consensus on the right way to understand it, no consensus in the right way to understand that.

Speaker 1:          01:00:12       It was a very disturbing concept. People like me, we want you to say, well, water is wet and oxygen is this. You know, this is what it is. I think a thousand years from now, historians of science will look back on the 20th century and shake their heads in despair. They'll say, look, you guys, quantum mechanics fell into your lap and you didn't spend any time thinking about it. You didn't try very hard to understand it. That's embarrassing. Really. Like the general public or science professional scientists, people with phds in theoretical physics. Wow. So when it comes to the people that you were talking about, like scientists sort of dismiss quantum mechanics, what are they dismissing and how are they doing? Well, to be very, very clear, they're not dismissing quantum mechanics. They use quantum mechanics everyday. They love quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is a recipe for calculating what's going to happen in your experiment.

Speaker 1:          01:01:01       That is an unprecedented precision. It's really the best way we have of knowing what's going to happen in the lab that we've ever invented and there's no reason to think that it's wrong, but then when you press them on, okay, what was really happening? What is the description of reality that corresponds to the calculation you just. Did they get annoyed and frustrated with you rather than give you an answer to the question? I'm sorry. Like what? Do they get annoyed and frustrated with you? Like when you have these conversations with these people? With anyone? Yeah, they will. You will. Because they don't understand this. Well, they don't understand which is fine, but they act as if not understanding it is okay and to me that is not fine. They will say, my job's not to understand the world is just to make predictions and I think that's not really the job of science or physics at all.

Speaker 1:          01:01:48       Their job is not understand. It's to make predictions. Well, how can you make predictions if you don't understand what you're making? A prediction that is exactly the situation with quantum mechanics right now. Like we have a recipe, we have an algorithm set of rules, do this, do this, do this. You get an answer, and the answer is right. The answer is verified and experiments over and over again, and you say, well, okay, why is it right? What was happening? What is the thing that is moving around? And they go, oh no, no, don't ask me about that. That's hilarious. Now what do you do most of the time when you're not teaching? So like if you're working on this stuff, like I, I would imagine there's not someone telling you what to do. Right? So when you're, when you're working on this kind of stuff, like how do you structure it?

Speaker 1:          01:02:28       Yeah, it's up to you, you know, there's this sort of a selection effect that did that. The ability to structure on your own is, is necessary to get to a certain stage in your career. But uh, yeah, I had students graduate students who I work with as well as other colleagues that I collaborate with, but it's roughly speaking, going into the office or going to a cafe, sitting down with a piece of paper and a pencil and writing. That's what I do. That's my job. You go to the office or a cafe and you sit down with like one of these yellow legal pads and you write all that chicken scratch that. Nobody understands. But you guys have recently changed. Now I have an ipad pro with an apple pencil and I do you do all that. Only very, very recently upgraded. But maybe you can get yourself onto them saying samsung note eight, that it has the pen on it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       Have you seen that? That's pretty bad ass. You can. Yeah. While the screen is dark like this, you don't have to turn the screen on. You pull out the stylists and you can draw notes on screen. Okay. Up until I got 180 pages of notes. Like on the actual screen itself, you don't even have to open it up. All right, that's pretty cool. But now I'm invested, now I got the ipad, so I know that's how it works. Right? But the things, the differences can carry that around in your pocket. Yeah, I know that is a difference. Yeah. But um, so when the idea is that there's a set of questions in our brains as professional physicists, there's an infinite number of questions, but at any one time you're focusing on a couple and you have a couple of ideas. And so you say to yourself, well, maybe if things are like this, then this would follow and let's try to calculate what that would lead to.

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       And does that lead us someplace good? Or is that just crashed and burned? And that's what you do over and over again until you get a paper you can write. And where do you start from? Like what is a, like let's say you get to the cafe, like what's your starting point? Well, so for example, let's do quantum mechanics. So we want to understand, um, the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. So you say that the world really is some quantum wave function, but you and I observe things like space and tables and stuff like that. Right? So what does that mean? What does it mean to say that there's a, there's a table lurking in the wave function of the universe or there's no stars and galaxies. So that means that there's some way of writing the wave function of the universe that is sort of here's a table, here's the rest of the universe.

Speaker 1:          01:04:44       So I might write down on a piece of paper, well here is a toy model, like a simple representation of the wave function of the universe that includes one piece and another piece and they're interacting with each other. How would I know that that was tabled? Like how, how would I know in tables they're not really what we care about, but why is space three dimensional, right? This is the kind of question we would worry about. So what would a wave function look like that represented three dimensional space? Is that natural? Could I poke at it and kind of make a prediction for what the early universe was like on the basis of that? Things like that. So now like when you do calculations, like say if you were doing calculus, do you study black holes at all? A little bit, yeah. A little bit reading paper right now on black or are you?

Speaker 1:          01:05:25       Yeah. And what are you writing about? Like what specifically? Well, there's this famous problem in black holes that they evaporate, right? They give off radiation. Stephen hawking back in the 19 seventies said that black holes weren't completely black. Right? There's, there's quantum mechanics as they will gradually evaporate away. So that's fine. We think we understand that. What does that mean? What does it mean to be, they're not completely, but what it is, what a black hole is essentially like the event horizon is this tiny, infinitely dense area and it's sucking in the galaxy around it. And uh, like supermassive black holes. that is that there is this still believed that there in the center of every galaxy and they represent one half of one percent of the mass of the galaxy itself. Tiny fraction. Right? So the larger the galaxy, the larger the supermassive black hole basically.

Speaker 1:          01:06:13       Yeah, that's right. So what is it? So what is the black, what is it? Yeah, a black hole is a region of space. It's a region of space where the gravitational field is so strong that you can never leave that region of space to go to the outside world. Jesus, that's what it is. But. So stephen hawking, so that's the, there's, there's different sort of levels of sophistication and thinking about what black holes are. So a one level is to forget about quantum mechanics entirely. Use general relativity. Einstein's theory of gravity that he invented 100 years ago, 1916. And he says, what is gravity? It's spacetime curving on itself. That's what gravity is. And he has equations to tell you how much space, time curves, etc. So we can describe black holes in, in those terms. and one of the things you find is that black holes only ever increase in size, right?

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       They can suck things in, but they'd never shrink because they just suck things in. But then in the 19 seventies, stephen hawking says, well, what if we take into account quantum mechanics? There are, you know, there's these clouds of probability all around the black hole. And he says, if I look at a black hole, does it look completely black? And the answer is to his great surprise and still to hours, no, it doesn't look completely black. Even black holes when you look at them, will be seen to gradually emit photons to emit radiation very, very, very slowly. And how were you looking at them? Like what method are you using this as a thought experiment? We've never seen this in the real world. The actual black holes we know about emit radiation so slowly there's no practical way to actually observe it. So this is entirely theoretical right now.

Speaker 1:          01:07:54       So. But if it is entirely theoretical, how do you measure that? They're not entirely black. We haven't been able to do that. We predict that they're not entirely black, but we've never verified that prediction yet. You're freaking me out, man. All this a lot. A lot of physics is making predictions that we can't get past, but someday we're hoping. But why even assume that? I mean, I don't understand what the motivation for assuming that they're not entirely black. It's not an assumption. It is. If you believe what we think is already true about general relativity, the curvature of space, time and quantum mechanics, then hawking says it. It follows from those assumptions that black holes are not completely black. they give off radiation. Okay? Now what about the theory? And then I've heard this fairly recently, that there is potentially another universe inside of a black hole that as you go into a black hole, you may in fact be going into another universe that's filled with hundreds of millions of galaxies that have hundreds of millions of black holes to the center and perhaps hundreds of millions of universes inside of them, right?

Speaker 1:          01:09:00       Uh, it's possible, which again, as I said earlier, is what you should always say in these circumstances. There's no reason to think it's likely, but it's certainly conceivable that that happens. By the way, the journey would not be pain free. When you look inside the black hole, you would die or you'd be very, very. The technical term is spaghetti [inaudible] because the gravitational pull is much stronger at your head than at your feet as you're diving headfirst. So you will be pulled into a very thin nonliving with cannon ball, but that doesn't help. Doesn't help. Did you go crazy when you saw that movie interstellar where, you know, it was a weird thing. I actually know a lot about the backstory there because kip thorne, who was, who invented the idea, what is it? My colleague at caltech. So, um, If you know, remember the movie or the book contact carl sagan wrote that movie.

Speaker 1:          01:09:50       So carl sagan, it was a brilliant guy, but he was not a physicist. He was a planetary scientist. He studied life on other planets and things. So in his novel he had this idea, he wanted his heroin a lie to get across the galaxy very, very quickly, faster than the speed of light. And so in the first draft he said she falls into a black hole and then she gets spit out somewhere else in the galaxy and he knew that that couldn't, that's not exactly right, but it didn't sound right. So he called up his friend to kip thorne, whose a very famous physicist at caltech who is, by the way will be winning the nobel prize and a couple months in october. Is it rigged a. No, but it's just such an obvious choice for. Because he also helped invent lego when they discovered gravitational waves.

Speaker 1:          01:10:30       And that's definitely gonna be worthy of the nobel lego lego. Yes. What's that? Uh, do you remember hearing the gravitational waves were detected a year, year and a half? Yes. So lego is the observatory that did that. Oh, okay. So that's his law, the observatory. So he was one of the other, one of the moving pieces, moving forces behind that. So gravitational waves were some theoretical thing that's now been proven to be real. That's right. Big announcement about the new gravitational waves from ligo might become. And yet that was August 24th. Pretty recent one hour ago. Oh yeah, I know what it is. Whew. So there's another. I know. What is it? Tell us. Can you tell us? Um, I can tell you because it's on the internet because I don't want to tell you because it's, I should let lego tell you, and this is a rumor, but I, I would just say stay tuned.

Speaker 1:          01:11:17       When we saw, when we saw last year, the announcement was black holes were spiraling into each other and giving off gravitational waves and that's what we saw. Okay. That's, that was the source of the gravitational waves that we saw. This news story is about neutron stars spiraling into each other or spiraling into something. I don't even know the details. They just a rumor, but it's a different source for the gravitational waves than we had before. Here it is beyond black holes. Could lego have detected merging neutron stars for the first time now merging meaning like this infinitely slow pace that you're sort of measuring. Nobody's very fast. Very fast. It takes seconds once, once they're. Once they're together. Yeah. Once they were very, very close and emitting gravitational waves you can observe. Wow. And the exciting thing is, okay, once black holes can merge, why not neutron stars the differences that black holes, despite everything I just said them about not being completely black, are pretty darn black.

Speaker 1:          01:12:14       so you see gravitational waves, but you don't see them in your regular telescope. With neutron stars, there's a chance you can just see them as well as detect the gravitational. Now neutron stars, now when they're doing this, you know we're, we're talking about like how far away are we observing this? Oh, I don't know. Usually millions of light years. Wow. So anything you're observing happened millions of years ago. Yep, that's right. Jesus. That's the. That's one of the bigger mindfox. It's hard to get your head around when you look it up in the sky and you're seeing something that's a million light years away. Yeah. When you're looking through a telescope, you're seeing something that might not even be there anymore. Oh yeah. Well, in this case, you know it's not because it gave off one of the biggest explosions in the universe. Then that's what you're seeing. The aftermath of those neutron stars are no longer around.

Speaker 1:          01:13:04       If they're, if they're that it might've made a black hole, there might be some black hole remnant. Wow. Yeah. If we've observed the birth of a black hole for um, I don't think we've observed the birth. We've observed one big black hole being made out of two smaller ones. That's a leg. That's what lego saw, right? They actually observed it taking place. It depends on the definition of observed. We know That it happened. Yeah. From the gravitational wave. Sacred. Sure. That we observed. Okay. So you have a signature that is undeniably the evidence of this. Now this one, I don't know the details here with a neutron stars, but they're, they might be able to say there is no black hole left behind. I don't know. I'd be surprised. That sounds very precise. Very unrealistic. But that's the kind of thing we would hope to be able to say someday.

Speaker 1:          01:13:47       I've seen that on drugs. This thing. Yeah. You're showing if you take dmt, you can see that. So what is this? Uh, this is the animated depiction of these two black holes spiraling into each other. And because this is another one of my caltech colleagues that do need to get outside and it looks like he's just been buried in books, then we wouldn't get good physics and those people went outside. Don't let him outside little bit. StAy inside that a lIttle bit, buddy. Kid outside of some pictures don't make themselves, I'm sure. No, I'm sure they delegate. He's got this fish on the wall, he's losing his mind. He's drawn fish. Um, when like when you try to make these visual representations of something that is like, essentially you're, you're, you're only interpreting, you're getting the gravitational wave, you're getting the information that data. And then you try to make a visual representation of this thing that's for the general public, right?

Speaker 1:          01:14:45       It's not basically not really for you guys. That's right. So if you could also though see the event happened using visible light or using your regular telescopes, that will give you enormously more information. So that's always a good thing to aim for. So as they do like this, uh, this array that they're putting together in Chile and all these different, new, more advanced super telescope are raised, they're trying to get more and more actual visual information so that people could see this stuff or something. Something. I mean, there's a lot. It's much easier to detect light than it is to detect gravitational waves. So this is the sound. This is the actual gravitational wave from the early detection's, the first ones we got last year. So this is lygo hanford on top, and lego livingston. Is this the actual sound? There is no actual sound. They translate it into sound.

Speaker 1:          01:15:39       It's a gravitational wave that they said, well, what if it were a sound wave instead of gravitational waves? This is how it would sound so confused. And I was watching a documentary and they were talking about hyper novas and uh, they were talking about the initial discovery of hyper novis that they detected this gamma radiation, these bursts in the sky. And they originally had one working theory that there was some sort of an alien war going on right now. Always do that. Like astronomers, bless their hearts, they are happy to at least contemplate. Some of them are way out speculations like when pulse ours, which are just spinning neutron stars. When they were first detected, they were called lgm for little green men because they were these very, very regular pulses and people say what could it be alien? Right. It's sort of not like one of those planets that we've observed recently had something that was orbiting it and they were trying to figure out if it was some enormous space station that was causing this.

Speaker 1:          01:16:39       Well, there was, yeah, there's a something that got labeled the alien mega structure, which is basically like something that is bigger and colder than you would expect, but maybe if it were, you know, some structure surrounding a star, that's what it would look like. And I wouldn't bet on that. I don't think that's the reasonable. Whenever I read something like that, I'm like, oh, they just want funding. They just want to get people excited. You don't get any funding for that. No anti get funding for that. For really. For an alien mega star. Yeah. Because the people giving you funding or your fellow scientists

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       taking cheap thrills rather than being serious. So what you Do is you get hits for your website and you might not necessarily like when you're going through some of these websites that science websites for the most part really straightforward sort of titles to their articles. But occasionally you get a little click baity oh yeah. With some stomaCh women. Human beings, they would like little more likes on their juice it up a little bit. Get people excited. Yeah. Um, so when they first initially discovered this, these gamma ray bursts and they thought there was some sort of an alien war going, going on in space. Um, I mean there's, I mean, so far, nothing, right? So far there's no detectable evidence whatsoever of anything out there other than us. That's right. But wheN the thing, if there is, I mean when an, if. Right. If the thing comes, if one day we get some sort of undeniable signal, whatever it is, or we see something or how does that get processed? Like do you have to go like straight to president trump and go, hey man, I would not do that. No, that's not what I would do is like saY if it was one of your colleagues

Speaker 2:          01:18:26       though. There is a procedure. It's not even very well publicized as far as I know procedure or like a more self appointed. I think it's like, you know, people have said, all right, we are the alien detection network. You might be able to keep your mouth shut if you like. People can't handle this shit. Well I think it's, I think that we're not very realistic about these. I think that it could happen. Um, but we're just like with quantum mechanics or artificial intelligence or whatever, we tend to put everything in the frame of what we're immediately used to. Right? So we can redeem out radio signals into space. We're really good at that. Right? So we tend to think that aliens will either be discovered or actually contact us by beaming radio signals and us. But that's a hOrrendously wasteful way to do interstellar communication.

Speaker 2:          01:19:17       Right? For one thing, radio waves move at the speed of light. So imagine you're a thousand light years away, you have no idea what's going on on earth, but you say, well, there's a. It's a promising location for life to arise. I know wHat I'll do, I'll beam a signal at them. Well, how long are you going to be mad? You're going to turn the telescope on for a month. Then in the whole history of humankind, they better be listening the exact right month. Otherwise they're not going to hear it. It's actually way more efficient to send a spacecraft eVen though it's much slower. That's okay. You have plenty of time. Send a space craft and park it in the system that you want to know about and then wait for life to arise in that system. So honestly, if we're going to detect evidence for aliens, it's much more likely we're gonna find a monolith on the moon or something like that. Then we're going to hear them in our telescopes. A monolith. The moon wasn't

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       that 2001, right? But wasn't that something that uh, one of the astronauts said they saw something up there. Some of those astronauts have lost their mind as they got older and I've always wondered, like edgar mitchell's the big one, he's the one who says he's seen some things that aliens are real and I always wonder, are those guys getting crazy as they get older or they're going, look, I got to get some money. I need some. I need some attention. What's the best way to do it? It happened to that alien market. That alien market's a big market. They could be perfectly sincere, but look the way you want when you pick who's going to be an astronaut is someone who can fly the spacecraft bank, right? They don't need to have good judgment about whether or not they're aliens up there. That's not what you're goIng for.

Speaker 3:          01:20:49       You. they just need to have an understanding of what the task is and how they're gonna perform it. Yeah. Edgar miTchell was a he. I think he might've passed away recently. Did he pass away, but he's one of those guys that people always bring up when I'm not a believer necessarily in. Not that I'm not a believer in alien life, but I'm not believer in anY of the people that say they've seen aliens. Are you juSt. I did a show for psi phi and one of the episodes we did, we spent weeks talking to people that are ufo researchers and studying the air quote evidence, right, and there's nothing there like be a good basie and if someone sees some flashing lights in the sky, what is more likely alien civilization or they're not accurately reporting what they saw, like eye witness testimony is terrible, terrible, terrible in this specialty, in these weird cases.

Speaker 3:          01:21:40       Yeah. IT's just very, very dismissible. So. Right. And you want to keep an open mind because if there was a unique event where an alien spacecraft did enter our atmosphere and observe us and then take off, it would be quite fascinating. If you could actually get a good read on some more. I think it'd be hugely important to the history of life on earth, right? Like human history. If we won, if and when we finally discover intelligent life out there somewhere else, that will be one of the most important events in our history. The idea that it's a, you know, a 20 foot long flying saucer that comes and visits you in, in Wyoming is not very plausible. well also the idea of physical beings on board. this thing seems counterintuitive. Like why? Why would they do that? Like we don't have to do that anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:22:28       Like we send the mars rover up there, we get amazing footage. It stays up there forever. It doesn't need food. Exactly. So that's what they'll do. They'll send a rover here. Not a. Not a either a person or a radio wave. That's what I would imagine. I would imagine it would be. Obviously I don't know what the fuck I'm parked. So if you're getting mad right now, I get rid of the aliens. That's okay. I would just assume that it would be some super complicated drone and what they would. Yeah, they would try to just take data, observe, maybe get some sort of a visual understanding and obviously with the kind of telescopes that we have, like the [inaudible] eight when they were 22,000 miles out, we take these incredible high resolution detailed video and photographs of the earth itself. What kind of shit to the aliens. they probably don't need to get anywhere near us. Right? Yeah. Imagine that

Speaker 2:          01:23:16       weird thing is there. You know, the fermi paradox, they should be here already, right? Like the solar system should be buzzing with these drones and either a. Well almost certainly it's not because it's not clear why they would try to hide from us really. And if they don't try to hide, they'd be easily noticeable. So there's something we don't understand about life in the universe either. it's much more rare than we might guess or for some reason it's not very gregarious that doesn't go and visit the rest of the stars in the galaxy.

Speaker 3:          01:23:48       My thought was, and this is a obviously a very controversial thought, but no one wants to think that we're the first. Right. That's like, well, if there's us, then there's probably more right, maybe right, but maybe it has to happen once. Some it has to happen for the first time somewhere, right? Like this, like a single celled organism had to become a multicell organism and had to take place through mutation and it had to take place at one point in time. Will that time on this planet, at least it was the first time was one, one point eight mil billions of years ago. Right? Why do we have this? We know that we are the only thing that's ever done that as far as we know here, so why would we assume that anything else that we might be the tip of the spear?

Speaker 2:          01:24:37       It's completely possible, I think, and it's also possible that we're. That life happens all the time, but it never becomes multicellular or intelligent. Mm, right. Or becomes intelligent, but never build spaceships. There's many, many ways it could happen, but yes, we could be in the entire observable universe. The only spaceship building species right now.

Speaker 3:          01:24:54       Well, we also have this weird way of defining intelligence by the ability to change your atmosphere, your environment, or your to, to, to build things like, that's what we think of as intelligent, whereas dolphins are obviously extremely intelligent, but they don't really impact their environment much at all other than biological life, like eating things and waste and things along those lines. But they don't build structures. They don't,

Speaker 2:          01:25:17       they don't keep records, they don't. And we live in a weird planet that is roughly, you know, I'm a comparable proportion of land to ocean, right? Be very easy to imagine planets that were all ocean that, that the dolphins were the apex predators and that was right. And so, uh, just got really smart, really good at eating fish. Yup. Yeah. They played games and whistled songs and that was great. Yeah. Well also the idea that life only has to exist in this goldilocks zone has always been weird to me. Oh yeah. No, very strange. Also, I don't know, one that we're already finding exceptions to that, right? Like even here in the solar system, uh, you wouldn't necessarily look to earth first if you didn't already know, uh, the moons of jupiter and saturn are very plausible places to look for the of life, even though

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       they're outside the goldilocks zone because it's just different conditions. So I think we should be very, very open minded about the conditions around other stars where life could form. Yeah. I mean we find weird life at the bottom of oceans and volcanic events insanely hot. And they find these, these life forms that are able to thrive in those conditions that would kill almost everything else. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And part of that is, you know, it's, I think that the response to that would be, well, life started in fairly benign conditions and then evolved to survive in these harsher conditions. But I just think that our ability to understand chemistry and biology is not that good. Especially hypothetical speculative chemistry and biology. We should be very humble about saying how life needs to be on other planets. Right? We always assume that it has to have water and it has to get carbon based and, and maybe that's right, but we can't say that we know.

Speaker 1:          01:26:53       Right. Did you ever go through a period in life where you were obsessed? Are fascinated by aliens? Yeah. When I was a kid, uh, I certainly not only aliens, but psychic powers and all this stuff. I was very, uh, you know, interested in all the cool stuff and I became more and more scientific as I aged and yeah, those are weird things that are somehow or another linked together because they're, I don't want to be mean in saying this, but they're bullshit. You know, like the psychic powers are aliens and when you bring up the fact that it's very likely these things are bullshit. People get very upset. Like you're taking away their santa claus. I don't know. There's a video I saw literally this morning on the web of the. These people stood outside a little mark on the corner of a street in New York where people were buying power ball tickets.

Speaker 1:          01:27:47       Okay? So people buy powerball tickets and it's like 10 bucks. And they come out and they were offered, can I buy your power ball ticket from you for $20 for twice what you paid for it and 11 out of the 14 people that I said, no, I'm holding onto my ticket. Right. Because they thought that this ticket was the winter and they're like, this is $700,000,000 that I'd be given you for $20. Right. With no rational justification. But they, you know, it's, it's in some sense innocent. If you just. Okay, you're wishful thinking about your own little ticket, that's fine. But it leads us to be not completely rational and planning our futures. Yeah. I'm with the people that won't take the 20. Is that a role it come on? I mean it might go in and buy two more tickets yet with the 20 would just be 20 and it would just be $20.

Speaker 1:          01:28:33       Now you can go, but you might have in your possession you might the ticket or it might be the next one. But what if you give it to them? Give them the ticket, you get to 20, you go buy some users tickets. And turns out the ticket you gave them was 700 million bucks. You've got to jump off a roof. And what if the one you buy is the worst one? The one that when you're a glass half full kind of guy, aren't you? The probabilities work out, you know, it doesn't really matter. You don't know what the number is going to be. Right? But that the randomness of it all, what gets people like

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       panicky, right? Like what if, what if it could be, I mean, the best way to, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:29:09       calibrate your odds of winning the powerball or saying, you know, just play the numbers. One, two, three, four, five, six. And people were like, well that's never going to come up. You're like, actually the probability of that kind of is the same as any other one that you're going to pick.

Speaker 3:          01:29:22       Huh? Doesn't matter what it was. Just random. Now, have you ever read anything compelling at all that leads you to think that maybe somebody might have observed something that could potentially have been something from another planet or some sort of.

Speaker 2:          01:29:39       No, I don't think so. I mean, I think that a astronomers do have a set of things that they don't understand very well. The most recent example are these things called fast radio bursts, which are a little bit different than the gamma burst, gamma ray bursts, but you know, as always, the more we think about it, the more we say, oh, actually I can come up with a perfectly plausible explanation for that is nothing to do with alien. I'm going back to this sort of uploading consciousness thing. There's a very real possibility that once civilizations or intelligence pcs become sufficiently advanced, they upload themselves and they realize there's not really any motivation to go exploring the universe and maybe die anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:30:14       Yeah. That's what my thought would be, that once civilizations get sufficiently advanced, they would go per virtual. They would figure out a way to create these artificial universes to travel into that are probably just as complex, if not more. I think we have every right to imagine that given them, you know, so little about what it would be about right now. Yeah. But if we can create artificial intelligence to that is the very bizarre. It's like if we can create artificial intelligence and somehow or another corral it into existing only in this virtual world that we've created, and then inside this virtual world you're interacting with these artificially intelligent creatures that are disembodied, right, and then in this world you would give them some sort of a body and you would interact with them.

Speaker 2:          01:30:59       I think that again, the thing that we under appreciate about that is what is the motivation that these artificially intelligent entities would have? Like we human beings like it or not, we get hungry. We wouldn't have sex, we wouldn't have power or whatever, but like if you're just a virtual being in an environment without these energetic constraints or a need to eat and sleep and so forth, why do you do anything at all? I don't know. I mean, why would. I have no idea what the psychology would be like for something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:31:28       Did you see x mokena? I did not. How dare you? That's an amazing movie. I saw it twice actually. I think I saw three times. It's really good. I mean, it is a very balanced take on potential artificial intelligence and someone making it as you can see it really well made movie, but you see the story that was sort of, I don't want to give away too much of it, but you see the struggle in these things as this guy is interacting with these things and you see the struggle as they're to

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       interpret what they are. Right versus what he is. But they are in bodies, right? They're like, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah. Gotta wonder like what? I mean, elon musk is terrified of this shit, right? I mean, he said that we might be summoning the demon. That's his exact quote. Yeah. Yeah. And I get a trouble. I tend to agree with him. Um, and again, to get in trouble on twitter for saying that I agree with him, but because people who are actually doing artificial intelligence have this very real appreciation for how far away we are from something that you would classify as intelligent in any real sense. And so therefore from their day to day perspective, the worry about superintelligent ai is taking over the world is laughable. But my argument, and I think Illinois is that, yeah, but what is the percentage chance have to be that this is going to happen before you start worrying about it, if, if the consequences, really the ruination of the world, right?

Speaker 1:          01:32:54       There are only so many things that we do for which the worst case scenario is quite that bad. That's what makes it a special circumstance and it might be very, very unlikely, but are you willing to say like, okay, one percent chance that all human being destroyed? I don't think that's, that's actually the worry, but we should just do our due diligence, right? We should think about what the possibilities are. We should plan for them. Probably no big deal. When I said this on twitter, people knowing that I was a physicist, we're like, well, what did you think about people who are worried that the large hadron collider was gonna destroy the world? Right? I said, well, what do you mean? Physicists did many, many studies checking to see whether or not it would destroy the world. We don't want to be destroyed anymore than anybody else and so I think that's a very sensible thing to do for artificial intelligence also.

Speaker 1:          01:33:40       yeah, I agree. It just when you see articles like did you see the recent article or the google ai that they had to shut down because they were starting to communicate which with each other they invented. That language was not very convincing. If you ever saw it printed out, I'm sure. But to me that's, that's like a scene in a horror movie where like, and then you go to 10 know blank screen. Ten years later we're all dressed up like mad max. We fucking, you know, bandannas over our face and we're running from terminator bots. So I think that's the thing, you know again, and again we're coming to this theme that our imaginations are not quite up to the task because our imaginations about superintelligent ai or something like that. SomeThing frankensteined ask it just in robots or something like out of asimov, but the I think much more realistic worry or things like currently existing neural networks and deep learning algorithms. So basically there's all sorts of problems like pattern recognition, facial recognition, right? We are very, very bad at sitting down and writing a program that recognizes faces. Human beings are not very good at figuring out how to do that, but we have ways of building programs that can teach themselves to recognize faces and they're amazingly good. So we have programs like when you onto google or your

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       itunes or whatever and you know your ifo is recognizing your face. There is some neural net that is doing that and there is no human being alive that understands what it's doing. All we know is that it's getting the right answer. Okay. And that can be. That kind of logic can go very, very far. And so I'm not worried about like a robot like ultron taking over. I'm worried about are all of our infrastructure being run by programs that no human being understands. whoa.

Speaker 3:          01:35:27       Oh, that's something I hadn't even considered, but yeah, that's a real issue. The real issue, right? That's an actual real thing. I've always wondered whether or not what human beings are doing with our insane lust to innovate and to constantly create new and more spectacular things and to always look for the next version of something. We're not satisfied with the iphone six. We want the iphone seven. That's not a problem, but that wednesday the eight come out. We always have this intense desire for better things. We don't. I mean, unless you're a classic car advocate or add a devote, we really what you want is like, oh, this new car stops faster at handles, better, accelerates quicker. We always want things to constantly improve and I've always. And when you look at human beings, like if you looked at us subjectively, that's one of the main things that we do.

Speaker 3:          01:36:18       We, we produce better technology, better objects, better engineering. It's like constantly improving and accelerating and then there's this potential artificial intelligence thing. I've always wondered if that's really what our focus or what our purpose is on this planet that were like some sort of an electronic caterpillar there going to become a butterfly that we recognized and some sort of a weird way or nature recognizes the biological limitations of flesh and tissue and that it can advance far better with something that we create so that we don't even realize what we're doing by making this cocoon that we're just building it up, building enough and we're not even thinking about what we're doing. We just, I want a new laptop, woo, and by buying this and buy this materialism that we all have, right? We have with this, people have this innate sort of desire for new and shiny objects that that is fueling this innovation and that's pushing along this and that one day we're going to give birth to this new version of life. We can call it artificial life, but it's not artificial. It's right there. It's just created by human beings, which obviously are created by this intense and very long evolutionary process, but this might be a part of that process.

Speaker 2:          01:37:36       Yeah, so I would, I would tend to want to remove from that the sort of anthropomorphic are teleological aspects of the language like that it's a purpose or were meant to be here, but I completely agree with the idea that there's a threshold that has been crossed, whether you want to say it's the last 500 years or the last 10,000 years, uh, they're human beings have developed the ability to do something that has never been done before and that has this sort of recursive self reflective thing that we can build things that can build things and we can build things that can learn and we can build things that are like living things. And we are just at the very, very beginning of exploring the space of what's going to happen because of that. And the idea that we human beings are going to be around 10,000 years to enjoy the fruits of that.

Speaker 2:          01:38:26       I have no idea whether that's true or not. I don't even know if that's bad. I mean, maybe it'll still be human beings. Maybe 100 years from now we'll cure death and aging and we'll stop having kids and the people who are alive a hundred years from now will different other million years. Maybe human beings will just become more and more, uh, melded with artificial things and they'll have artificial bodies and so forth. Or maybe, you know, one another under appreciated thing I think is that at the very, very small scale where we do like nanotechnology and so forth, there is a whole bunch of problems that have already been solved at that scale. Namely biology cells, right? Like cells do many, many things really, really well and they also repair themselves. They're much less brittle than things that we build using metal. Okay. So synthetic biology, just programming existing biological organisms or designing new ones, but we would still recognize them as biological, but it might be very, very different than anything that naturally appeared through the course of evolution so far.

Speaker 2:          01:39:32       That could be the thing that takes off and 100 years from now, that's all the living beings or all the beings with higher intelligence left on earth. I mean, I don't know what the actual thing that's going to happen is, but what I know is that the pace of change is just accelerating. We're just at the very start. Yeah, we really are. And it's, it's. So do you ever sit around and try to extrapolate and trying to like look at where we are now as opposed to where we were at the turn of the century and a 20th century and just thinking like where is this going? I mean this, it seems like any day now some new invention can be put forth that changes the way we interface with reality. Right. And it's subtle because it's not uniform, right? It's not like it's a weird fact if you wanted to make a movie and set it 50 years ago.

Speaker 2:          01:40:22       Right. So in the 19 sixties it wouldn't be that hard to film outside and in certain areas, certain suburbs, it kind of looks more or less like look in the 19 fifties. Whereas it's actually, it would be harder to make something that was in the 19 sixties look like it did the 1910. It's right. There's sort of more obvious visible change just because cars were different and so forth, but you don't see the sort of technological change that might be have a far bigger impact, uh, in electronics and artificial intelligence and so forth had happened in the

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       last 50 years. So jessica, there's no visible sign of the change. Doesn't mean that the changes cannot be eventually a very profound. It's always amazing to when you look back and like science fiction movies from the eighties where they were predicting 2017, you know, they, they thought we were going to be flying around in space constantly. Yeah, like the movie alien. What year was that supposed to be? I think that's like the year $2,100 or something like that. Right? It's not that far, but what we're really good at is taking things that already exist and extrapolating it to be faster and bigger. Right. So if you can build an airplane, then you can build a rocket ship and arbitrarily fast. That's easy to imagine. But things that change culture, like really curing aging, that's hard to imagine what that would be like. It's also greedy because like where are we going to put all these goddamn people?

Speaker 3:          01:41:42       If they live forever, you live forever and everybody has four kids. We've got a real problem on our hands. No more. No more kids. No ham clearly. Do you have kids? No. Well that's why you say that, but I'm not gonna live forever either. You know, if I did have kids and maybe their kids would live forever, but you know, that's, that's the thing. That's the size of the change in society that will be required by something like that. Twenty one, 22. That's When alien takes place. That's 100 years from now. Get out of here. There's no way it could be. Maybe a model. They had some shitty monitors for 21, 22. I mean, god, they were terrible. Terribly one know. Yeah. But the inside of the cockpit for mother when that dude gets in there and finds out that there's some giant plate far into the future.

Speaker 3:          01:42:26       Right? oh yeah. It's really, really hard. Yeah. I think we're more likely looking at some sort of a augmented a desktop sort of scenario. Like, um, have you seen these new products like, uh, that microsoft is working on and some of these other companies, but I think before very long, it won't be a desktop, it'll just be our thoughts really. We'll just, you know, like I remember what I had for lunch. I'll remember what the population of Malta was in the year. 1,500. What am I looking at here? Jamie? Shitty movies. This. Yeah, this is the first one said. I mean, that's. So I was googling, it could of got tagged with something else and I didn't recognize it, but that's pretty, that's pretty good. looking pretty good. No, that can't be the original alien is it? I Think that's like alien two or three. No dramas. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:43:16       this is bill. Is that the first one? The second one you clicked on? Yeah, that's, yeah, they look pretty bad ass. So that's trauma. What I meant was there's a white room that, uh, I forget the actor's name in the original alien, the original alien. People don't even realize it was in the seventies. It seemed crazy. Yeah, it's corny weaver ages very well, by the way. Just, sorry, what was the. Oh, the defenders here's done yet. Um, because she was in that movie up. she's probably in her twenties back then, but that movie in 1979, like their idea of what? Twenty one, 22 is going be like they had

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       like weird lights flashing and the cabin that didn't really seem to make a lot of sense, but they looked electronics. These might've been pictures from the new alien. Yeah, that's what it looks like. Yeah. Because they could do to kind of look like a tesla is yours. Yeah, it was weird because they're kind of saying this is like from actual production set. Oh yeah, that's the new one. See? Because they're kind of saddled down by the problem that they're replicating a film, you know, that was from the 19 seventies and there might be settled down by the deavers that look like you're in an airplane. Yeah. Would not be like that. You don't think so? No. It could still be here in your head. He thinks I need buttons. Yeah. So even navigation while being here. Well, I think we live in the only generation that's going to get repetitive stress injury from poking it or devices all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:44:39       Really? Yeah. That's what, that's the most useless thing that. well, it's a very slow, inefficient interface type. Being on your cell phone. It takes best. I hardly do it anymore. A lot of times I'm talking to my phone now. That's very old fashioned wri. Very retro. No, no. Using voice recognition software. Yeah. Okay. Right. That's retro mean when to make phone calls. oh, I do that too. I'm a crazy phone call person. Um, but the uh, text function ready for his recognition function, that's really amazing. I don't use it as much, but yeah, look how good it works. I'll show you right now. It's really pretty interesting. We can click on this, right? There's like the notes thing. This is how I do a lot of this stuff. Like if in my car and I have an idea that comes to me, I'll either record it like with the voice recording function or sometimes it's better to do this and when you're doing this it essentially can pick up everything you're saying in real time and print it out.

Speaker 1:          01:45:36       Yep. They cut it right. That's amazing. Right? Bad is. I mean everything perfectly spelled. What I Just said folks is now on my phone. Amazing. What does this scene, these are the new. I don't know how well they work. I've only seen him out and commercially whatnot, but real time in ir translations and french spanish, english. I've seen chinese, japanese. oh, I've seen that. Size of an ear bud. Yeah, I've seen that. So again, once you have the link inside and he just interface with your brain, then essentially you will speak every language. One hundred 29 bucks. That's amazing. So you can go. Is it called babel fish? That's what it's called. Like it like it. Like oh, that's not the name, but I know, but that's not the name of it. What is it? What's the name of it? This one I have now from waverly labs, it's called the pilot.

Speaker 1:          01:46:20       I think the pilot. This is pretty awesome though. You just go this way. He's japanese. One of them. On this particular one? I don't believe so, but I'm 90 percent sure. I've seen videos like on facebook showing a japanese one. I'm finding my first trip to Japan and that'd be very bad. Just has amazing. Yeah, I've never been there. What you going to go to tokyo? Where are you going to go? We were flying. There's a conference in food cola and then we'll visit a hiroshima and osaka after that. Oh wow. Kyoto. Hopefully. I went to Japan a few years back and it feels

Speaker 3:          01:46:49       like you're in a super polite alien world. Happy. That sounds good to me. It's beautiful. They're very polite and the food's amazing. Even more one to one. And then using watson. Watson to do more languages and I just said before portuguese scroll up so I can see what it looks. So watson is an example of one of these programs which learns things that we don't know how. Right. Okay. That's a problem. And that speaks japanese and french. So yeah. So this one is, um, how does it, where jamie, what do you see the bluetooth and wifi out of the range of bluetooth and wifi translate one to one can still work just as well as the first device on the market for language translation using ai that does not rely on connectivity to operate. It offers significant potential for its unique application across airlines, foreign government relations and even not for profits working in remote areas.

Speaker 3:          01:47:43       Whoa, that's crazy. So, uh, so it's different than the pilot earpiece. How's it, how do you wear that? Soccer was like get over your head. It sounds just like a hearing aid would probably just look like that. And I'll probably be big now just like they use probably big gets smaller and smaller. This would not be sexy while you were wearing it, but yeah, unless you're into that stuff. Um, it was saying that you download language packs so it'll be off the internet. Yeah. So essentially it'd be like, um, there's these map applications like onyx maps and stuff like that. you can download like a, like sort of a google earth type to topographical map of areas and you could look at it, say if you're hiking, you could look at these on your phone. Even if you don't have cell service, you can just pull them up and get a google image of like, oh, hey, here's the creek that we have to go down to get water.

Speaker 3:          01:48:36       yeah. Yeah. We're getting. It's getting super slippery. Two hundred 79 bucks and you can use that sucker. That's right. Now that's amazing part. Don't do it. Take three to five seconds to translate. Woo. Most languages there's a thing called google lens, which is pretty amazing too. I use this when I was in Italy and you take your phone and you look at something through your phone and it translates it on the screen, which is amazing. Like you're looking at a sign and you hold it up and it'll tell you what the site like. We were at a train station. I was like, what the fuck does that sign? Say you put your phone up there with the google lens and it'll translate it. I know I use that. The only problem was like for menus, it's like, what is this out with roses chicken. I have no idea what that is. But yes, right. Yeah. Well fortunately, or unfortunately when you go abroad, uh, americans travel so much and so to a english people from england shore. Yeah. But it's such a common language. Most of the world can speak english. That's right. Yeah. We would definitely have an advantage. That was huge in Italy. I mean it's like you barely need to understand anything other than saying thank you and saying, you know, hello and good evening. Things along those lines. One to sarah, you, um,

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       you can get by. But yeah, the first time I went abroad to farm speaking country was France and I was just too shy to talk to anybody because I was not in paris. I was like out in the middle of nowhere where people did not speak english and you know, by now I'm an I. And I even had like read the phrase books and things like that. But by now I've just done it so many times. I don't really care. I'll try to speak my two words of the local language and then try to switch to english and if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. CAn we just do hand gestures? When you traveled a place like France, France, excuse me, people have this french people in particular. There's always the stereotype that you hear that french people think that americans are rude. Like I would like try to go like way out of my way to make sure that no one thought I was like a rude american.

Speaker 1:          01:50:28       Yeah. Because there's always this reaction that they have. Like the worst case scenario is the american goes over there and it's pissed off that they don't speak english and they started don't know. My first trip I was treated very, very well in France. Very, very politely. I even like I bought something in a store and I didn't understand what the price was, so I just sort of kept gIving money until they nodded and by mistake I had given too much and the guy like ran out after me to catch me leaving to give me my money back. That was uniform. except in transportation industry. It's like whenever I wanted to buy a plane ticket or whatever, that was very, very hard. The ironic enough with a rude or were they just definitely tired of dealing with tourists, you know, I would, I would say in french I would say, you know, do you speak english?

Speaker 1:          01:51:18       And they would say, of course I do in french. I'm like, okay, well then can we do that? Yeah, they're probably just exhausted. That just exists. But that's how it is in America. I mean, you deal with people at the airline counter. They always had this look in their face. Like, what time is it? When do I don't, I don't have to doing something you're not passionate about unlike you with your legal notepad, right. In the alien languages and uh, you know, I can find somewhere it's a, it's a great privilege what I do for living, right? Like, I can't believe that I get paid to do this and it's hard. I have to tell my incoming graduate students, if you get a phd in theoretical physics from caltech and you probably want to be a physics professor because that's the only thing you can do with that degree and your chances are maybe 25 percent of that's pretty damn good.

Speaker 1:          01:52:01       It's good. But after You, you're like 26 years old and putting a lot of work to still only knows the 25 percent chance of succeeding, if that's still pretty amazing. I mean, if you're trying to be a standup comedian, your odds are like one percent if you're lucky. No, the very, very good thing about academia is it's very clearly upper out and you know, you, there's time limits. Like if you haven't succeeded by now, you're gone. You can to be discovered tomorrow. Uh, you usually go to wall street and make a lot more money. Oh, so hE's to be in physics from caltech. You're not going to start praying. People will hire you to do something interesting. So what would you do on wall to wall street with a phd from caltech these days? All the money's being made by algorithms that study of the stock market

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       and destroy human beings picking stocks, right? Renaissance technologies and places like that. Um, I mean, like we were just talking about, but soon the entire stock market will just be dueling algorithms trying to sell something a microsecond before something else does.

Speaker 3:          01:53:00       Now you are involved in a hard science, right? I mean, you're, you're, you're involved in this trying to understand the world and the universe itself. Do you get, do you see any of the identity politics issues that are going on on campuses today? I mean, it's such a hot subject, whereas

Speaker 2:          01:53:20       a little bit, you know, I don't, my job at caltech is research professor, so I don't even teach a lot of courses to be honest. And caltech is not the typical campus in many, many ways. Uh, but you know, we just had a professor who was basically fired, uh, for harassing students. It, it does happen. Sexual harassment. Yeah. That's trying to get laid. It wasn't quite, it was more complicated than that. He fell in love with a student and fired her. And um, and yeah, there's just no question that, you know, I'm in an area of theoretical physics where there's a very tiny fraction of women, um, and even tinier fraction of african americans and so forth, but that's kind of less surprising because they just don't come up usually in economic circumstances that put theoretical physics is one of the plausible future research careers.

Speaker 2:          01:54:09       Uh, But you know, I see an enormous amount of discrimination against women in my field and it's there and women leave and some of the complaints against it or are overblown, but many of them are very, very real. so that's a real problem for us. I think it's changing. I think it's fixing, but it's slow. What kind of discrimination do you see? It's these days it's usually very subtle. It's usually a, you're taking a little bit less seriously if you're a woman. I mean there's all sorts of tests that have been done, right? Like people handed out a mathematics papers and with, and then all they did was change the name of the author James Smith versus Jennifer Smith. And they were always ranked much worse when it was Jennifer Smith who was the author even. It's exactly the same paper grilling and, uh, and know there's a certain style of aggressive in your face, egotism that serves you well in academia generally.

Speaker 2:          01:55:04       And in physics in particular, uh, putting yourself forward, asking questions, being loud and noisy and a women are less good at that for whatever reason. They're not trained to do that or it's an eight. I have no idea. But, uh, they can sort of get bullied into silence or just say like, this is not worth it. I'm going to go do something. We go to wall street to make money. Also a woman who does that is not likely to be received as well as a man who does that, held against them. Yeah. They're deemed to be like a bitch. Yeah. So my guy was aggressive at caltech. I'm on the fourth floor of a building, which is the theoretical physics, theoretical high energy physics group. Uh, so there's maybe 30 people, total professors, post docs,

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       graduate students. Uh, and until this year, there were zero women out of 30, which is just embarrassing. It's just bad. Right. And who would want to be the one woman? Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, especially there's two like men either who thinks they can have sex with you or amanda can never have sex with you. Right. That was, we both annoying and like, if you're lucky you get a guy who doesn't want to have sex with you, he just wants to be your friend and that, that's all right. Yeah. But I think that, you know, honestly, if I were giving advice to young women whose primary goal was to become a successful theoretical physicist, you know, if that was your only goal, then don't raise a fuss about sexism or discrimination because just like worrying about the interpretation of quantum mechanics counts, it's points against you when you're being judged as a theoretical physicist worrying about discrimination against you.

Speaker 1:          01:56:40       Key accounTs as points against you. People think like, oh, you're, you're not really interested in physics. You just want to make a political fuss. Wow, that's unfortunate. Keep quiet. Yeah. I mean, I know that what you're saying is pragmatic, but a lot of people don't want to hear that, like keep quiet. They don't want to hear, keep quiet. When you tell women too, when you're talking about discrimination, so maybe your only goal in life is not to personally become a successful theoretical physicists. I mean, just as a. I don't, my advice is not keep quiet. My advice is if that's your goal, the way to achieve that goal is to keep quiet. That's gross though, right? It is. and so I think that it's the job of the guys to raise a little bit of a fuss about this and you know, I saw that at caltech where this guy recently got fired.

Speaker 1:          01:57:22       How many people were willing to make excuses for his really, really, really bad behavior. Uh, you know, it's, it's unseemly to talk about these things. We hope it's not true like these, this is our friend. This is someone we worked with. We don't want to believe this about them. We want to protect him. So physics, philosophy, astronomy, all these areas are now having these examples of famous big name professors that it's finally being revealed for last 20 years had been regularly harassing graduate students and pushing them out of the field. I think maybe finally that's coming to light enough that it's hopefully will go away a little bit. Human folly, you know, it's interesting. It's a lot of what we were talking about earlier with the people that don't necessarily understand quantum physics. And so they sort of dismiss what's important about it or people that, you know, just use their, they, they, they rely too much on ego or they, it's too much of a part of their life. I mean, they human folly, that sort of make excuses and gets involved in everything. And you know, I'm uh, I'm not, uh, the broader question of identity politics, etc. I mean, I'm, I'm pretty lefty justice warrior about this stuff. To be honest, I think that, uh, the number of women, for example, women are just the most obvious example in my field who have been

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       pushed out of my field because of bias and discrimination in very, very obviously, you know, um, verifiable ways is just, that's the big embarrassment, you know, but at the same time I'm kind of a free speech absolutist if some crazy person who has very retro grade views wants to say those retrograde views. And I think that if someone else wants to invite them on campus to do it, I think they should be allowed to say all the craziness that they want. I don't think that's the right solution to these problems.

Speaker 3:          01:59:10       Yeah. I think the solution in those cases, for someone who's got a legitimate viewpoint to debate them, yeah. The marketplace of free ideas. Actually the chancellor at berkeley just put out a very good statement saying exactly that and I gave her credit for that. Well, that's great. You know, Because I know that they have an issue there with ben shapiro coming who is a very reasonable guy and sometimes gets lumped into the alt right and gets lumped into these fees. Not that at all. It just happens to be conservative and young and very articulate, but for awhile they were trying to limit his participation there and putting them in the same category that they would put milo yiannopoulos or of these other guys here, which it's we're, we're very weird with free speech and that we love free speech as long as it's in line with how we defend free speech for people we agree with. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:59:58       I mean, I don't know ben shapiro, but Larry Summers is another example. He gave this famous speech at harvard. He was the president of harvard and a world famous economist and he gave this speech saying, well, maybe the reason why we don't have as many women physicists as male physicist is because of a, a different distribution of innate abilities. Now I think that you could make a veRy, very good case that his substantive claims were entirely bullshit. Like he misread the data and he was making excuses and that's one thing. That's the guy on the street. It's another thing if it's the president of harvard. Okay. But then after that, like people were saying, well he shouldn't be invited to give talks about economics at other universities because he said this bad thing. I think that's ridiculous. He said, we're world class economist. Like he was wrong and you should criticize him, but I want to hear what he has to say about economics. That's something that

Speaker 3:          02:00:49       entirely different because it also. There's never an issue with someone who's a professor who's constantly used to really not being questioned and been giving lectures and being able to talk in front of students and you develop sort of a general hubris about your own opinion.

Speaker 2:          02:01:06       Well, I would hope that, I dunno, in my areas of academia, you can't get through lunchtime without having all of your opinions at the time. Like that's just what we do. Right? Like it's, you don't, you never sit around and say something and everyone agrees. That seems like a very healthy profession. Then that's hoW to get things, get, make progress, but of course usually we're talking about the wave function of the universe, dark matter. Right, and you know, to be very, very fair. There's, like we said before, there's still prejudices about purely physics topics like you talk about quantum

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       mechanics or the nature of the dark matter and in discussions get very, very heated and emotional and people's jobs depend on it and the whole bit. But the idea that things go unchallenged is not a. That's just doesn't fly very far in this field. Well, that's beautiful. I would love to talk to you about what you just said, dark matter because that's something that I would imagine if you went out and just randomly polled a thousand people, all 1000 would have no idea what dark matter is. Yep. There may be gay. Oh yeah. It's like part of the universe. It's really. We can't find it, but it's. I think it was rick and morty recently that had a silly episode about dark matter. It's a, it's a cartoon, a cartoon network. Show a. It's a hilarious, silly thing that uses science fiction to to, to actually do that.

Speaker 1:          02:02:30       Yeah. I think I know what you're talking about. Dark matter is real. It exists. Yes. Okay. How do we measure it? We measure its gravitational force. It pushes things around in the universe. So what do we think it is that we don't know? That's the. That's the thing. We know certain things about it. We know that it's dark. We know how much of it there is. It's about five times as much mass in dark matter. Then there is an ordinary matter. Ordinary matter is every particle we've ever seen ever, right? So all of the atoms, all the stores, all the galaxies that we see in our telescopes, that's five percent of the mass, and then dark matter is 25 percent and dark energy, which is something completely different is the other 70 percent of the universe and these, those are facts. Those that's basically, you know, 99 percent likely to be true.

Speaker 1:          02:03:20       What it is, the dark matter, the dark energy that is much more up in the air that we have lots of candidates and we're not sure which one is right. Boy, that doesn't help, does it? Well, you know, so I went on science friday, you know, science friday with a ira playdough npr show. Okay. Um, and he says, he says like you, cosmologist, like, shouldn't you be embarrassed? You only understand five percent of what's in the universe. It's amazing. They know that much. We know five percent of us, the universe, like 100 years ago we didn't know anything about the universe. We didn't know the universe was expanding. We didn't really ever other galaxies, you know, come on. This stuff takes more than a few months to figure out five percent I think is pretty healthy. Yeah, I think we're getting there. What is the current theory as to like where it resides and how it's formed and what its properties are and what impact it has on the galaxies? I think this is a really, really good question because we might be in flux right now for a long time. Like basically from the 19 eighties to today, there was a leading candidate for what the dark matter was, something called the wimp, weakly interacting massive particle. So if you indulge me for just a second, we have the particles we know and love. Uh, there are four forces that push these particles around. There's gravity, electromagnetism, and then there's the strong and weak nuclear forces to nuclear forces.

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       And the nuclear forces are distinguished by being short range, like you don't notice it in your everyday life. You gotta be down there at the atomic scale. So it turns out that if you imagine a new particle that obviously interacts through gravity because everything interacts through gravity but doesn't interact through the strong nuclear force like a proton does, or through electromagnetism that will be charged, but it interacts through the weak nuclear force. Okay? So you imagine a particle interacts with the weak nuclear force relatively heavy, and you calculate how much of those should be leftover from the big bang. You get the right amount to be the dark matter. So this is called the wimp miracle. The idea that if you just hypothesize out of the blue, a new particle that is invisible and stable and interacts through the known force of nature that we call the weak nuclear force, that could easily be the dark matter.

Speaker 2:          02:05:31       So that was seemed so natural and simple, and there were many more complicated theories that predicted that such particles would exist. I would say that many people, 10 years ago or so, I would have said there's a 90 percent chance that wimps, weakly interacting massive particles are the dark manner. Here's the problem. If the wimps, if the dark matter is wimps, we can build detectors and look for them. And we have done that. We've built these giant detectors, deep underground. You're shielded from all the cosmic rays that are just noise and contaminating your experiment, uh, and you wait for a little weakly interacting, massive particle to pass through your detector and bump into an atom underground underground. Uh, usually these are in minds, right? So they're an old gold mines, a mile underground, counterintuitive. So you're going a mile underground to search for something that's in space.

Speaker 2:          02:06:22       I made up the mile. You might want to, if you can get even 100 feet underground in a deep mine, it seems so counterintuitive. You'd think you'd have to throw something into the sky, live in a noisy environment that the trouble is not detecting them. The trouble is seeing them peek out over the noise. That's what we're trying to do. It's like going into a quiet room to listen to something very, very well. Was the initial discovery that led to the conclusion that dark matter is the preeminent mass of the universe. Like what? What percentage of the masses? It will. Sorry, let me just finish this up very quickly because this point is that we have built these detectors and we haven't seen the wimps. Oh, okay. So for the first time people are beginning to shake their belief that maybe wimps are the most likely candidate.

Speaker 2:          02:07:04       There are other candidates, other kinds of particles. That could be the dark matter. Maybe it's still winds. We just haven't found them yet. That's still possible, but I would say if five years from now we haven't found the wimps, then people are gonna start saying it's something else. Okay, so the first evidence, uh, well, you know, it comes in drips and drabs. My, my caltech predecessor, fritz zwicky famous astrophysicist back in the 19 thirties, pointed out that galaxies were orbiting each other too fast in what are called clusters of galaxies. You look out there in the sky, you see like these bunches of galaxies that are orbiting each other and you calculate how heavy the galaxies should be from what you see. You can calculate using newtonian laws of physics, how fast they should be orbiting. They're actually orbiting much faster. And he said the only way for that to happen is if they're much more massive than youth on.

Speaker 2:          02:07:53       if there's much more mass in there, there's some missing mass. Okay. But at the time we didn't know it could just be stars that we didn't see or gas or dust or whatever. it wasn't really until the 19 seventies that vera rubin famous astrophysicist looked at how individual galaxies are rotating and she found that it's a similar kind of thing. The edges of the galaxies are moving way faster than they should be given the amount of matter that is inside. And she concluded that a lot of dark matter causing a gravitational pull that we didn't see but is causing this, the edges of the galaxies to spend a lot faster than they should be. Wow. so that is the reason why. Is there a possibility that some new discovery could happen or could come forth where you would re examine this idea that there's some missing mass is always a possibility.

Speaker 2:          02:08:46       Um, I, so there's certainly this idea that is on the market that because all of our evidence for dark matter is indirect because it's through it's gravitational influence, not by directly touching it or seeing it. Maybe we just don't understand gravity. Maybe gravity is a little bit different now. I would argue, and I think I'm right, not everyone agrees with me sadly. But, uh, that idea has basically been killed off by our observations of the microwave background radiation. You know, we are 14 billion years after the big bang there was, you know, the big bang was very, very hot and dense. And is glowing to beat the band everywhere, but it was also opaque. The light didn't get very far and about 400,000 years after the big bang it cooled down enough, it became transparent. And then these, this, these photons of light just stretched travel through the universe unimpeded.

Speaker 2:          02:09:42       And we can see that the leftoveR radiation, we can see these faint patterns, these oscillations in the microwave background, which look exactly like they would look if dark matter we're causing them and they don't look what they would look like if gravity were modified. So there's a much longer version of that story. But the basic thing is if you, if I can just pull authority and say, trust me on this, uh, I was, I was totally on board with the idea that there was something wrong about gravity. That'd be very cool thing. If it were true, there'll be a big mind bending discovery. But we've tested that and the microwave background, there were predictions. It would look this way if you modified gravity that way, if there were dark matter and the answer is spot on to the dark matter of predictions. Very different from the modified gravity predictions. So dark matter exists. So dark matter exists. And what percentage of the universe is currently believed to be matter? Twenty five percent.

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       Twenty five percent. And I read once that they had discovered in entire galaxy that was made out of dark matter. Yeah, pretty close. MayBe not entirely because then you wouldn't see it, right? It's hard to discover it. That was what I was going to ask. How do you see this stuff? Like how does, like how if you can't detect it, if you will, you know it exists, right? But you know, because of its effects, that's a, you don't, you can't like point to it. Like you can point to the sun, right? So you need some tracers, you need something that tells you that dark matter is influencing the motion of stuff in this, this mdm space. So in a galaxy, it's just like the stars at the edges of the galaxy and most of the mass in our galaxy is dark matter. Like we see the pictures of galaxies that you see that look very beautiful.

Speaker 1:          02:11:20       The actual size of the galaxy is much bigger than that, but it's all dark matter. The galaxy you see is a tiny little puddle, you know, one fifth of the total mass, let it sort of settled down to the center of this big puffy cloud of dark matter. Whoa. And the. When people say, well, there's a galaxy that is only dark matter. What they really mean is it's almost only dark matter. It's a puffy coat or dark matter where most of the stars have been pushed out by something. But some of the stars or the gas you can still see orbiting around and that tells you there's a some concentration of dark matter there. Do we know what dark matter is or does? There is. There are. There's lots of theories. Chimps were the biggest theory, but there's alternatives. There's one alternative. It could be small black holes that were made in the very early universe that seems unlikely.

Speaker 1:          02:12:09       There's another kind of subatomic particle called the axion, which is nice because people invented it for totally different reasons and they also worked out that could give you exactly the right abundance to be the dark matter. And there's a whole, there's the, You know, dozens of different theories out there for what it could be. So we're looking, we're trying to figure out which one is right. What a weird thing to have something that's invisible. That's a giant percentage of the entire universe in a large percentage of galaxies, right? Yeah. Percentage of galaxies as dark matter most nineties in the nineties. Yeah. well, uh, let's say 75 percent, 80 percent, something like that depends on the galaxy, but uh, on the other hand, what right to be think that we have to think that most of the universe should be readily visible to us. Now, does dark matter exists on earth or is it only in deep space?

Speaker 1:          02:12:58       It depends on what the right theory of dark matter is. But in most theories, there are dark matter particles passing through your body right now. So with this wimps detection theory of where they've developed these detectors deep in the ground, would that would be able to detect something that's actually prevalent here on earth? Yes. And it's not that they're stuck to here on earth, there were, the earth is just moving through space, so there's a wind of dark matter particles that were passing through and occasionally bumping into and we're moving in some sort of a spiral through the moving and we're orbiting

Speaker 3:          02:13:31       around the sun, right? Yeah. Now the, the, the Big bang one is another weird one. um, because I was watching this thing on television that was proposing alternative theories to the big bang and one of them was that the universe is next to another universe and that somehow or another it collided with this universe. And that this is a probably a process that repeats itself. I know we get paid to come up with these ideas and that's what we're doing. you know, they're in starbucks with the pencil and paper. Yes. What do you buy iNto that? Like which one do you

Speaker 2:          02:14:03       by handling it works? No, I don't personally think that that's very likely. It's on the table. It's a reasonable. Is it still on? Is it a recent. Yeah. Um, uh, when was it first suggested? Maybe around the $2,000 or so.

Speaker 3:          02:14:16       And did it, did a bunch of people jump on board or wouldn't say save something like that comes up. One of your colleagues has this idea, so then you go to the cafe with your legal pad and gore and how do we do this? exactly. That's right.

Speaker 2:          02:14:26       And so what you would do in that case, so someone proposed an idea and you say, well, okay, how would we test it? How would we know? Well, maybe, uh, like we said before, maybe it predicts some pattern in the leftover microwave background radiation from the big bang. If you're a different theory for what happened at the big bang, then maybe your imprint post big bang is a little bit different. And that's exactly the kind of thing we're looking for now. So

Speaker 3:          02:14:49       the imprint, the microwave imprint of the Big bang, this 14 billion year old event. Yeah, what is the, like terence mckenna had a fucking hilarious way of describing it. I do a terrible job of butchering it, but, um,

Speaker 2:          02:15:06       that people like,

Speaker 3:          02:15:09       it's funny how he was talking about how many scientists are atheists that they don't want to believe in god they don't want to in. He was an atheist as well. He was an atheist rather as well. But, uh, he said, but they are, they do want you to believe that everything came out of nothing for no reason that anybody knows of 14 billion years ago there was this infinitely small area that was smaller than the head of a pin. And that's everything you see in the sky and it exploded 14 billion years ago and no one knows why. That's right, yes. Good. but isn't that a mean? That is so crazy. And you know, it's one of those things that theorists, you know, uh, people that are really into a god's religion, they point to like, well, this is the scientists. God, this is this, this event, this is a miracle. I mean, this is the way bigger miracle than walking on water or turning wine into water, into wine. I mean, that's

Speaker 2:          02:16:06       baby stuff. Exactly. That this scenario would be 100 percent compatible with the laws of physics in a way that turning water into wine. He's kind of not. Yeah, I think that the. So here's the thing, and I think this is actually not always communicated very well. The big bang is the phrase, the big bang Is used in two different senses. One is what we call the big bang model, which is the whole history of the universe for the last 14 billion years from an original hot, dense state expanding cooling galaxies form. Here we are. That's true. That's settled. Not art. We know that. That's right. Okay. The big bang model, but then there's also the big bang event. The beginning of that story time equals zero. The initial singularity, it's a prediction. If you, again, if you remember we talked about in black holes, you have general relativity, einstein's theory of gravity.

Speaker 2:          02:16:59       It makes predictions and one of those predictions, if you trace the universe backward in time, you hit a singularity, you hit a moment when everything was infinitely dense, infinitely fast expanding, et cetera, et cetera. That's the bIg bang moment and it is certainly not true. it's the opposite of true. It's, it's. It has no right to believe that that actually happened because it's a prediction of general relativity, but general tiffany's not right in that regime because you're ignoring quantum mechanics once again. So if you don't think that you understand the fundamental quantum mechanical rules of the universe, you have no right to say what happened at the big bang and what physicists should say if they're being honest, is that could be that there was a first moment in the history of the universe, the first moment of time, a day without a yesterday, and once we understand quantum mechanics and gravity and how they play well together, that will all be very clear.

Speaker 2:          02:17:54       Or there could have been something before. You know. There could be the, what we call the big bang, may have been just a phase. The universe goes through occasionally and this bouncing universe idea that you were talking about with the two different universities hitting each other, that would be an example of a scenario in which the universe was eternal, that it lasted forever and right now we have no way of knowing. We're very openminded. It's 14 billion years ago. Maybe it was the beginning, maybe it wasn't. We just don't know. What do you take? Um, of the idea that the big bang is process a continual expansion and contraction process and that it starts with the big bang, the universe expands and then somehow in other polls back into itself until it becomes this incredibly dense small point again. And then the whole process starts from scratch, right?

Speaker 2:          02:18:42       Yeah. That's one of the scenarios on the table. Um, in fact, this, this idea that you referred to, which was what was originally called the egg pie erotic universe. Don't ask why it was some ancient greeks. Cool name. Yeah. It's a cool word name. So that was the idea. There's this extra dimension in two universes of smacking into each other. They later realized the same people, very well known, respectable physicists realized they could just play the game over and over again so you could have this smacking together call that the big bang, it expands and cools, but then it recontract and there's another bounce and just goes on an infinite number of times. I am personally not that fond of this idea. Number one, there's no evidence whatsoever or reason to believe that our universe will ever contract, if not only expanding, but it's expanding and faster as doing the opposite of what you would expect for we're going to contract, so I don't think that's very likely.

Speaker 2:          02:19:32       And number two, the single most impressive empirical fact about the universe is the difference between the past and the future, what we call the arrow of time, right? A, you remember the past, but not the future. You make choices now that affect the future, but not the past. So this difference between the past and future is nowhere built into the laws of physics as we know them. All the laws of physics that we know treat the past and future the same. The reason why there's a difference is because of the big bang, because the big bang was a very, very special organized state that the universe could be in and ever since then we have been expanding and cooling and sort of winding down and that's the fact you have to explain if you want to explain the origin of the universe in my view and the idea that there's an infinite number of cycles. Doesn't explain that fact at all.

Speaker 3:          02:20:24       There you go. Lawrence krauss was trying to explain to me the size of the universe and the age of the universe and he was saying that 14 billion years, like when we look back into the known universe, like the, what we can say is like 14 billion years, but he was saying that that essentially doesn't mean that that's as far back as it exists. It just means that space is moving faster than light. when you get back to that distance, there might be something even further back than that, but we're not going to ever be able to see it. I hope he didn't say exactly that. I'm sure he did. Right, so fuck that up, I'm sure.

Speaker 2:          02:21:01       But again, sometimes even my favorite people in cosmology used this language of space expanding faster than light. Entirely bullshit because space doesn't have the speed. The expansion of space is the answer to the question. You know, spaces this big. By whaT amount has it expanded in

Speaker 3:          02:21:21       one year? One second later, right? I have heard that expression before, that space is moving faster than light. So why now? Why did they say they shouldn't say that? Saying that. I know because they're lazy and bad. Saying that these are like high level guys. Yeah, I know. Okay. So what is the never going to be invited back to cosmology conference after this podcast? Well, you always have the infinite monkey cage. That'll, that'll be my new career. Right. So what is happening then?

Speaker 2:          02:21:47       Well, space is expanding and light is moving through it. Right? And what is certainly true is that the speed of light is a finite number, right? Right. It's one light year per year. The way to remember it. Right? So if the universe had a beginning, a finite number of years ago, then there's only so far out that light can get between now and then. That's all there is. So there are things far aWay that are so far away we can never possibly see them at this current age of the universe because it would take longer than 14 billion years for light to get from there to here. And that's just because the universe has a beginning. It has nothing to do with the fact

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       that space is expanding at the speed or that speed. Okay. Um, if there is a, a point where the big bang begins, right? There is a single origin point and it explodes outward and we are seeing it from some position. So we're seeing this explosion 14 billion years ago. Does it move in the opposite direction as well as their $28, billion years and you know from point to point. Right. So it's not like that. The big thing is not a point. Okay. The big bang, and this is, this is hard to wrap your mind around. The big bang is not a location in space, it's a moment in time, the time in the history of the universe when everything was on top of everything else, uh, it's easier to talk about one microsecond after the big bang, then the big bang one microsecond after the big bang.

Speaker 1:          02:23:17       The universe could very well have been infinitely large. We don't know. It's not like the universe started some micro second, so any other time? Infinitely small. Well, let's just forget about the infinitely small. Okay. Insanely small things were closer together. There's no such thing as the size. If the universe is infinitely big, it's always infinitely big. Okay. But you can still the big bang. Oh, okay. So if all matter is condensed into a very small spot, it doesn't mean that all things around it are not infinitely large. Well, you don't want to say around it because we're talking about the entire universe. So it visualize an infinitely big universe full of stuff. Stuff, stars, galaxies. Okay. Like right now, like right now, and let's wind the clock backwards. So suck it all in. Yeah. So the thing is that as far out as you look, even if you look at, you know, with your god's eye view faster than the speed of light, there's still stuff out there.

Speaker 1:          02:24:14       It's uniformly spread, let's say. Okay. So. But it's closer together. It's the relative size. The relative distance between galaxies and stars is smaller in the past than it is today. But the whole size of the universe is still infinity and that's still true all the way back. Fourteen billion years, right up to the big bang. The universe could have been infinitely big, but the density, the amount of stuff in a cubic centimeter goes to infinity. Whoa. Yeah. How big is the estimation that it was at the moment of the big bang, but before, like before it expanded, right? It's thought to be fairly small but infinitely dense. Right? well, I don't even think you can say it was thought to be in fairly small. No, the observable universe. So I think this is, this is maybe what gets lost because the universe is finite in age. We only see a part of it. Okay. When you see a part of it, a few tens of billions of light years across called that the observable universe. That's fine. I didn't size. Okay, so that definitely was smaller and there was an actual number you can attach to the question.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       How big was it at the big bang and we don't know the answer. We can sort of. It depends on theoretical predictions. It was the biggest possible size. It could have been. Was about a centimeter across the biggest possible. Yeah. As big as it could be. So you're talking about essentially like a pinky nail. That's right. That's as big as the whole universe could have been that. That's right. In fact in this, so everything you see, everything around you right now that you can reach out and touch every galaxy out there with billions of stars in them. They were all condensed into this one centimeter cubic region of space. What is the large, and it couldn't be much smaller. That's the largest. It could. That's the largest. Oh, that's as big as it could have been. It could have been much smaller. It could have.

Speaker 2:          02:26:05       What is the smallest? It could have been, um, will be called the plank size, a 10th of minus 35 or 10 to minus 40 centimeters or something like that. So incredibly tiny invisible. Oh yeah. Very, very invisible. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. Why do we think it happened? Well, what is the reason why the evidence we have? Yeah. What, what, what is the current theory as to what, what the big bang. Like why did the big bang take place? Well, that's. So, that's a good question. So there's no preferred conventional answer. We just don't know that that's not, that's not a, we don't know because we're not sure that's a, we have no idea is to answer. Um, obviously if there was a bounce or if there was some universe before ours, out of which ours came, there would be a sensible answer to that. We just don't yet know what it is.

Speaker 2:          02:26:54       It's a more challenging question. If you think that the big bang was truly the beginning of the universe, which is perfectly plausible, it's perfectly compatible with the laws of physics and then you're in one of these situations, you have to reorient the kinds of questions you will allow yourself to ask because if the big bang was the beginning, there's this intuitive feeling that there was time before the big bang when there wasn't anything and there was nothingness. Nothing just sat around for a long time and then it decided to bang. Okay. Could've sat around for an infinite number of years, right? Yes, but, but don't think of it that way is what I'm trying to say. Don't think about nothingness transforming into the big bank. Think about our universe thing of it from the other side, from the side that that we already exist, but visualize into the past and imagined that as you visualize into the past, you hit a beginning. You hit a first moment of time, a time when time itself came into existence, but there's no time out of which it came. That's the beginning of time. It's like walking north. You hit the north pole once you're at the north pole, you can't keep going north. There's nothing weird. It's just thAt everywhere, every direction you go in, we'd now be south at the big bang. Time is only toward the future, not toward the past.

Speaker 2:          02:28:13       That's all my mind blowing is that the era of time, the arrow of time is the particular fact that not only does time flow it, the universe changes. There are differences between the past and future. God. This time, this is tough. It's tough to. How do you guys sleep? Very well actually, when I was a kid, like it was 10 years older, so when I first got interested in this stuff and uh, so yeah, when I was 11 or 12, the thing that would stop me from sleeping was I be dreaming about, you know, the big bang in the universe. Then I would come to the beginning and we go like, but what if the universe had just chosen not to exist? I was no sleep for me. That

Speaker 3:          02:28:56       oh, choice, right? I know better now. I moved on to other more worldly concerns keeping me awake at night. So is there anybody working on any sort of theory to try to understand what forces might have caused it to burst forth?

Speaker 2:          02:29:15       Yes. So I mean there's two answers to that. One is yes, I'm one of them. There's plenty of people thinking about this kind of question, but really, I hate to say it, but you shouldn't ask that question because again, we're embedded in this world. So the question you asked was what are the forces that caused it to burst forth? Right? So that presumes that there was a cause and that, I mean causes and effects work themselves out over time. So there was a time when there wasn't a big bang and then there was something that caused the big bang to occur. So what I want to suggest is that that's just not the metaphysical framework in which to think about the origin of the universe. Don't ask what caused it, asked what were the laws of physics that can be compatible with both the universe we see today and with the universe having a beginning 14 billion years ago. We don't know the answer to that, but that's the question we should ask. It's, it's,

Speaker 3:          02:30:11       it's such a complex discussion. It's, it's so complex that it's almost like infinite and its possibilities that you, you, you, you go over all these variables, these possibilities and what we know and what we're learning and it's just,

Speaker 2:          02:30:26       well, it's very, it's complex, but more importantly, it's a realm that is just so far outside our experience and our toolkit for dealing with the world that we have no guidance, right? We're kind of at sea, like what are the kinds of things we should be asking about? What are the answers that would satisfy us? Right? Um, I would argue that there are brute facts. There are things we just need to accept if we come up with a picture of the universe, a set of laws of physics and a story for the history of the universe that says, well, the universe started this way and then that happened, et cetera, and someone says, well, why did it happen that way? And I would say there is no answer to that question. ThIs is just what it is. I might change my mind if you convince me, but there's no right to demand that there is a reason why things are one way rather than another. Do you have difficulty like thinking of

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       a potential reason that one day we will wrap our heads around? Did he think that it's within the realm of our possibilities, our understanding? It's always possible that there is a deeper explanation, right? But then you want to say, well, okay, why is that deeper explanation true? And I think that this chain of explanations bottoms out, I think that there will be one foundational appointed, which is not sort of self explanatory, but it's just. And That's the way it is.

Speaker 1:          02:31:47       Are there any legitimate scientists that are contemplating the possibility of a big bang not being the origin of the universe? Oh yeah, absolutely. The big baNg could be just one of these moments. One of these things that happens, a one possIbility is that there's another universe that it sort of big and quiet and empty, but through a quantum mechanical fluctuation, a little part of the universe could pinch off and become a separate baby universe and then grow by itself and that could be the origin of our universe. So like a stellar nursery for universes. Yeah, and It could go on, say the great thing to really. So I haven't blown your mind yet, but now I'm about to do it. Oh, you already did put it back together again real quick. When you look at the universe, the universe is finite in size. You know, we were talking about it could be infinitely big, it could be finite insights, but if it is finite in size, we think that a finite universe has zero total energy, zero total charge, zero total velocity, etc.

Speaker 1:          02:32:48       so making a universe costs nothing. Alan guth, who's a famous cosmologist and mit says the universe is the ultimate free lunch. Universes are not an expendable resource. You can make. if, if you could make one universe, you can make an infinite number of universes just as easily. I don't understand that. How, how it. Well, so you understand there is. Yeah. Well there's bath, right? So look, you look at the sun and you say, look, the sun, that would. That seems to be like it would be hard to make a lot of stuff there. It can just appear, but the son also has a gravitational field, right? There's gravity around the sun, and what the math suggests is that there is energy in the gravitational field of the sun which is negative and which is exactly equal to the energy of the sun and cancels it out so that if you've got a universe with nothing in it, but the sun, that universe would have zero total energy if it were closed in on itself. Wow. Yeah. It cancels itself out. Yes. So negative energy in gravity cancels the positive energy and stuff. Therefore, universes can have zero total energy. And this is all obviously very hypothetical speculative mathematical stuff. It's nothing we've done in the lab. So take it with a grain of salt. We could change our minds, but that's the current state of the art.

Speaker 5:          02:34:10       wow.

Speaker 1:          02:34:13       So the entire universe you believe revolves around that principle. Free lunch.

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       yeah, you could easily. So again, if you could make a universe at all, then you can probably make an infinite number of universes just as easily. It's not like you have a 100 pounds of universe stuff and that gives you a finite number to me.

Speaker 3:          02:34:32       EverY universe costs you nothing to make people have a hard time even thinking of there being more than one universe. And yoU start thinking about the fact that there's 100 million galaxies in this 100 million, at least $100, million solar systems. Right? And this galaxies is one of hundreds of billions of galaxies, the known universe. And that there might be more than one universe. Right? And the idea that this was all for our benefit seems a little ridiculous to very tiny compared to the size of the universe. Yeah. Well, that does get to be a bit of an issue at a certain point in time. Just the massive at all is a defies. It defies not just our understanding or our, our, like for the average person like myself, it defies your ability to put the what, what you're describing in the words, right? That's part of what the problem is. Training.

Speaker 2:          02:35:30       Yeah. As we keep pumping into. But here I can restore your, uh, your, uh, your thought that we matter for the universe. Bring it back pretty bad because we're wrapping this up in some sense. Uh, we are in the middle of the smallest scales in the important part of the universe versus the largest scales. If you look at the universe on very, very small scales or very, very early times near the big bang, the universe looks very simple. Not a lot of complications. Like We said, you can't build a civilization on an electron. It's just no possible intricacies there. It's a very simple thing. The universe is also very, very simple and large scale and it will get only simpler in the future. The university sort of dissolving into emptiness as the universe keeps expanding, it's only in between on scales, like the size of a human being or the earth and ecosphere that things are complex. right? So even though we're much smaller than the size of the universe, we're very big compared to adam's. The number of neurons in the human brain is roughly the same as the number of stars in the galaxy, so we are kind of a peak of structuredness of the universe of complexity. I mean until we build even bigger artificial intelligences and sO forth, but there's something that we are maximizing. Something that is a is sort of concentrated on us which is not size or scale or time. It is complication and complexity.

Speaker 3:          02:37:01       Wow. Now in the same sense that the energy and the gravity of the stars sort of managed to cancel each other out. Is that the case with people as well?

Speaker 2:          02:37:12       Well, if this is all again math, the whole universe

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       is a free lunch. The claim would consider a universe

Speaker 2:          02:37:21       with nothing in it, but you pick your favorite thing, a person, a star or a galaxy, whatever. Then the totaL energy in that thing, minus the total energy in the gravitational field, because that's negative would be exactly zero.

Speaker 5:          02:37:36       Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:37:38       That is super hard to wrap your head around. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:37:42       And then there's the big question, right? You wouldn't get paid the big bucks if it were using with the big question is why, like why do you think this is all happening or do you ever use that word? Why is, why is a weird word, right? Yeah. Why is it weird is happening? It is. So what's causing it to happen? What are the forces that caused it to happen? You ever. Why do you ever look at all and go, is there a purpose to all this? So. Sure. Um, and I think the answer is no. I think that the, I think that yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:38:10       there's no reason why. And again, just looking up into the sky, uh, you know, unless the purpose was to make a pretty sky boy, anything that we're seeing here on earth could have been done much with much less effort than making 100 billion galaxies. Right? Um, there's no evidence in anything that we've learned about science or the universe that gives us a reason to believe that there's a purpose behind it all. If anything, as time goes on, the entropy of the universe is increasing and the universe is becoming more random and disorderly. Um, I think that we're riding a wave of a universe that is growing and expanding and cooling and becoming more and more disorderly, and that's a finite amount of time. So 14 billion years from the big bang to today. Sounds like a lot. That's one point. four times 10 to the 10 years, but the future of the universe is enormously longer thAn that. According to our best current theories. It's, it's way. It's potentially infinitely long anyway. The last star is not going to burn out until a quadrillion years from now. We are very close to the beginning of the history of the universe and, but it's not forever. It doesn't last and infinite amount of time. So the universe is a femoral. We human beings and living creatures are temporary structures within it. And the idea that it's all for some big cosmic purpose, it seems to hold very little water.

Speaker 1:          02:39:36       Do you ever contemplate what, what function human beings have in the, in the university, the way we interface with reality, the way we interface with our, the nature around us? Yeah. I think that, uh, we don't have the function. I don't think it's the right way to think about what human beings are. We should be glad to be alive, enjoy it while we're here, uh, be nice to each other and try to learn more about the universe. But it's not if we choose not to do that, that's not going against any preordained function that we have. Your, you're a remarkably calm when you discuss these things. like, do you have any existential angst? Do you have any, like I think the other way around, and honestly this is very, very small amounts of data. But, uh, from what I can tell when personal tragedies strike people who are atheistic cosmologists and scientists deal with it way better than people who think that we're embedded in a matrix with a bigger purpose or a spiritual reality.

Speaker 1:          02:40:33       Really. Yeah, because you get that this, this happened and you have an infinite perspective, like when someone dies, it's sad. You can be sad, but you, you can't say, well, it shouldn't have happened. right? This is. These are the kinds of things that happen. Damn dude, it's gonna. Take a while to process. This is a long one. Go out and look at the milky way. I'm gonna. Have to listen to this about 30 times and take notes, but thank you very much and it was awesome. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much. If people want to get a hold of you or read some of your stuff, what is the best way? I have a website called preposterous universe. What a great name and you know my last book, the big picture, talked about all these questions about purpose, why we're here, what we should do about it. Is there an audio book available as it is? I recorded it not far from here. Excellent. Beautiful. Thank you so much, man. That was awesome. Thanks everybody.
