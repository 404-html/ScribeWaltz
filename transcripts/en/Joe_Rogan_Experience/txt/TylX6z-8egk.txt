Speaker 1:          00:00:00       He's like Metro pcs because I see all those commercials that they do. We live right now. We're live. We're on the air. Misha tate were on the air. I just had to let me take note of the world was flat. She didn't know that the man has been holding us down and fucking with us and given us bad information that satellites are bullshit and that the earth doesn't rely on gravity, but it uses electromagnetism to make sure things get stuck. Where is this coming from? The world. The world does a lot of people out there in the world that are waking up. Do you know what being woke is? Are you aware of being woke or you're not? You don't know about being woke. Jamie's woke stay, woke, stay. Well, you got to stay. Woke. Stay woke. So people think that the earth is flat.

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       Yes. You can all use also use wokeness as you could use it as like a. You could say like, I have wokeness. You know what I'm saying? Like you just because you're just because of the UFC bantamweight champion does not equal your wokeness wokeness you're woke bullshit. But the man has been the earth being round each round or its flattest fuck, the earth is flat and chem trails or the government spray in the skies and uh, there is no gravity. Here's square and stationary earth. Was this a new one? One of the parts of the theory you think about Kim. Kim chose a real. Is that what you're saying? Well, I don't know. I kind of wonder what they are and what are they? That's a good question. That's a good question. The problem is when people take that and then they go right to conspiracy question.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I have questions like I want to know what they are. When a jet engine flies through the sky and the jet engine encounters condensation in the atmosphere, it creates an artificial clouds. It's not an artificial cloud. It's an actual cloud. And the cloud is a direct reaction to the jet engine changing the temperature of the air in the atmosphere. It is scientifically proven. It's repeatable. They could do it over and over again. That's why when you see those things in the sky, those things exist. When the jet engines passed through the condensation and it changes the temperature and then they slowly fade away or not depending upon how much moisture is in the atmosphere. Some places do it and other ones don't. Well, because some planes are at different altitudes and some point, you know how clouds exist in some places, but they don't exist in other places.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       There's people, well maybe there's no connotation. Vegas. I was like, there's flights coming in all the time and you watch a steady stream coming in and none of them have it, but then like the little like, I don't know, they're like small. I don't know if they're small planes are not commercial planes. The little ones. Those are the ones that make all the chem trails, so I'm like, does that. Well, they chem trails. I don't even know if I'm technically saying it right now. I don't know what they are. What do they call them? They call them contract. That's the real. The real like if you ask a scientist, they calm cantrell's. If you ask conspiracy conspiracy, people that call him chem trails because they think they're spraying chemicals in the air, this is something that I had to like deeply study for this show that I did.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       Cultural questions about this for a long time. I've heard so many. I've heard obviously most of the conspiracy part of it, everybody hears about it. Everybody here is. I've heard that they're trying to like control the weather with it somehow by putting gas. Part of the problem is that they are trying to control the weather in different parts of the world. They spray, they do what's called cloud seeding, but cloud seeding is very different than what you're seeing when you see these artificial clouds with cloud seeding is they'll spray a certain type of chemical into in into the atmosphere that will create rain and they do it in Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi, they actually do it every every week. They do it once, so they've done it like 52 times a year and it makes rain. Yeah. That's been going on for a long time, but that's very different than these artificial clouds that are being created by jets.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       That's just a side effect for you though. Like the artificial travel, artificial jets or the rain? Rain. Rain. Well it's silver. Iodine I think and some other stuff that they find like find a breathe in and stuff. Yeah, I'm sure it's not any better than jet fuel. It's burning in your sky above your child. That's the real problem. Yeah, and the gas drive in here and all that gets people that live near airplanes or airports rather. They have a significantly higher rate of lung infections and lung diseases and lung disorders like adjusting like how far. Now I'm thinking about how far I live from the Vegas airport. It takes me like 20 minutes to get there. Fifteen minutes. Is that too close? I'll be okay. Well I think we're all fucked. Yeah, we're all fucked. We're all breathing and under the same flat. Exactly. Under the same flat earth.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       Well that's one of the problems with the whole chem trail theory. Like don't they live down here too? They're spraying this guy's like, what are they trying to do and the either the ideas there is either weather modification or that they're trying to change our behavior that some people think it's their change. Like it's, it's something to do with crops too or something and they're trying to. I don't know, the growing crops in Vegas, I don't think they grow shit in Vegas. Tumble weeds, they probably got it now. It's probably a lot of pot grown in vegas probably is. It used to be so illegal, like if you went to vegas you have to be like really careful about having weed, but now when you drive around they have these giant weed Dr. Bill Boards and show. It's really weird. It's like

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       the call one 800 hot babe on one side and then Dr. Weed on the other side. That's a weird place to live, isn't it? It is, but it's, it's. I feel like Vegas is kind of what you make it is whatever you make it. Like if you want to go down to the strip and be crazy and be wild and hang out with all the hooligans that are there for the weekend, you can, but if not, just live in your little house and go hike the red rocks and go down to the lake. It's pretty barren. Pretty Ugly Lake. Honestly. It came from Washington state, so I'm used to a lot of greenery. It's beautiful there and we've got the San Juan islands and you could go whale watching and she's gorgeous, but it reminds me too much. We have a national rain forest up there too. It's beautiful.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       Yeah. I'm a big fan of Washington state. The rain can fuck with your head, right?

Speaker 2:          00:05:49       Yeah. I couldn't. I lived there for. I mean I was 18 before I moved to the eastern side, which is very different. A lot of people don't know this, so the mountain range divide sustain half and on the east side, east side of Washington, that's super dry. It's like deserty, like there's actually tumbleweeds and sand dunes and all that. It's completely different. On the other side of Washington and moisture comes in from the ocean, hits the mountains, rolls back over rains like double duty on the west side. And the east side of wash of Washington is really dry year from spokane, right? No, I'm from Tacoma, Tacoma, Compton. To call it people call it. That's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah, it is. It's pretty ghetto. But I lived on the edge. It's really big actually. It's um, I think if I'm not mistaken, I should probably know this things, but I don't pay attention to a lot of things. You'll probably find out, I don't know, a lot of statistics and stuff. I'm kind of like, well it was fly by the seat of my pants, like whatever's going on. It's cool. But I think it's, it's one of the biggest circumvents the whitest cities, like not most populated but like most area in Washington anyway, so on. I live on the very outskirts like near Puyallup. So I grew up on like five acres and like I had some land, it wasn't like in the heart of it, but it's a pretty cool place.

Speaker 3:          00:07:00       So going from there to live in Vegas, but I guess like as a professional fighter, your days are probably so filled with training and recovery and being like, how much time do you have actually have to even be in the city that you're in?

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       Like none. None. I'm in camp really not much. Maybe on the weekends sometimes. That's what's nice about it too is you can go down there and just enjoy comedy show. I mean you come through often, like a lot of acts come through. Kevin Hart comes through a lot of musicians, a lot of concerts. So it's nice because everyone comes to you essentially. You don't have to go travel and see anyone. So if you want to just set the cup down for a minute and take a break from the chain gang or would it go ride the, the, you know, the big ferris wheel that they have there, the on the link, they want to go ride that or do whatever, you know. Um, it's nice because there's always so much going on as long as you stay outside of it like Henderson or something like that. I live in mountains edge. Um, so yeah, for the most part I don't ever even see this trip unless I'm driving by it. Like to go visit the UFC offices or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:08:07       Well it's a good place to live as a professional fighter. Right? Because there's a lot of gyms there. There's a lot of great training there. This across the board strength and conditioning and Thai boxing.

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       One is the home of the UFC so it's nice to not because there's a lot of extracurricular things that I get to take part of because I'm, I'm local. I could do a lot more charity things and with the boys and girls club and you know, just going in, you know, being a part of the year. See, I guess I get to, I get to do more things. Yeah. No,

Speaker 3:          00:08:35       your life is very different right now that it was a year ago. It is. How crazy is that? Yeah. You a year ago you were talking about like not doing this anymore. You will. I've got to figure out what I'm doing right now. You're the fucking world champ. Fricking

Speaker 2:          00:08:52       one 80. Yeah. My, my career in life, we couldn't have been different a year ago than it is now, you know, strangers that, how that can just in an instant, you just never know.

Speaker 4:          00:09:02       What does that feel like? It's like when you wake up in the morning, so you have to go to the belts

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       for real. I'm happy. It's um, it's enlightening. It's fun. It's great to be the champ. I, I love it. Honestly. It's a completely different thing. It, yeah. You know, a year ago I was so frustrated because, you know, when I lost her onto the last time, I knew I had a lot, a long road you to, to work my way back up. But I thought I had done that and when I beat Jessica, I, it was announced. It's like, you know, this is going to be then the number one contender eliminator fight. And then afterwards they were like, yes it is. You're going to fight Ronda. Then I felt like the carpet was kind of just pulled out from under my feet because they were like, just kidding holly. Holly's fighting. And they announced it without telling me. So that's why I was so upset. I was like, I don't take that shit lightly.

Speaker 2:          00:09:51       Like I was training my ass off already. I had already reached out to um, a girl in France, I can't say her name right. I think it's like Jeffery, I don't know some French name, but she beat Ronda and judo. So I had already been making plans with her to train with her and fire over here and choose changing things. Then I was like, I felt like such an ass, like I feel like an idiot, like I look like an idiot because here the announcement was made and I didn't even know. So I was kind of upset about that. But you know, we talked about and we smoothed things over and, and I took it personally at the time, but I don't think it was meant personally and it was a business decision and I understand that, that at the end of the day that's what it was and it all worked out. So

Speaker 4:          00:10:26       the UFC is in a weird position because they're both a promoter and sort of a sanctioning body. And that's really rare and matter of fact, I can't think of any other sport where that exists. Yeah. You know, they have just this ability to decide like they'll, they'll just decide like this person gets a show. Like the whole conor mcgregor situation is a perfect example of that. Like all of a sudden if he had beat nate diaz or if he had beaten dos Anjos dos Anjos didn't get injured and he beat beat Dosantos you fucking know for sure they were going to have him fight Robbie lawler. Yeah, for sure. And they were just going to like, figure out a way to do something with 145 Palm Tata. And why wouldn't they do it if there are business people, because that's where the money is. I mean it would have been if he had beat dos Anjos and then went on and fought Robbie lawler, Jesus Christ.

Speaker 4:          00:11:12       When you talk about like a $5 million paper view by event, they'd have to do it. It would be insane. But if that was like a sanctioning body, like you've seen it before in like boxing, like someone won't take a mandatory challenger and they get stripped even when they just won the title, it happens all the time. Like we're a phyto would just win the title and then they have this mandatory challenger who nobody knows go fuck that fight. I'm going to go fight Canelo Alvarez, I'm going to fight this guy or that guy. And then he gets stripped. Like because there's like five different sanctioning bodies. Like boxing is way more of a mess. So there's like pros and cons to doing it the way the UFC does it. But from my point of view of someone like you, it's probably much more frustrated. I don't

Speaker 2:          00:11:51       know what to expect. Like you get curve

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       balls all the time in the UFC. Don't know what to expect, you know, like a lot of people were so pissed off at me for, for the Holly Holm, not having the rematch right away. But it's like, it's not, it's not my choice, you know, they have over you because they think that I like turned it down or I should have went in there like guns a blazing for holly and like put myself out on my shield. Like, no, we have to have the holly rematch. You guys, you don't understand. But um, you know, they call me up. I'm like, Amanda, July ninth. I'm like, okay, fuck. Do you say no? No you don't. You can't say no. So they come up with you like I'm in. Yeah. And now you know, it's like, dude, relax. Most people don't get immediate rematches in their career. Like unless you are conor mcgregor or Rhonda or you know, someone that's really got a presence, you don't get an immediate rematch.

Speaker 5:          00:12:42       Like I didn't when I went back and strikeforce when, when I lost to Ronda, I didn't get into media. I've never gotten immediate rematch. My career. I would have loved to immediately rematch cat when I lost to her. But you don't get it. Sometimes you got to work your way back up and you know, hope for the best. But we will, I'm sure it will fight each other again. She's fighting a Valentino Oshun Shanko now you're going to be in Chicago, right? It's going to be on the rumble. Johnson Glover to sharer card, which yeah, that's going to be crazy. It is. And they're both South Pas and Stryker's is going to be interesting. Tough shit too. Dog. So interesting. She's very like physically strong. Like the way she fights. She's very physical. I think. I feel like they are kind of both. I was just watching her fight with Amanda again.

Speaker 5:          00:13:25       I think I only got through like the route and a half before I had to go because I was doing the Fox Fox show the other day and we weren't, we announced the fight with holly. That's why I was watching. She shouldn't Genco and um, she seems like a counter striker too though. I was wondering when you get to people who are counter strikers but elite strikers, what happens? Well, holly is much more of a kicker and holly also is like much more fleet of foot so it's going to be interesting. But holly's not weak either. She's very physically strong, super strong, it's going to be an interesting and that's a really good fight. And for shift Chenko it's super important. You know, she's had a couple pretty good fights in the UFC, but like this is the big one is like the map. Is it headlining?

Speaker 5:          00:14:05       Yeah. So it'd be a big one. Is that the main event? So I think that's the same card as rumble. Johnson and clover. I can't imagine that. That wouldn't be the main event, but I don't know. It might be on Fox Fox one. That's going to be a big job. It's a, it's an awesome card period that Chicago. Chicago's awesome. I love Chicago. Oh my God. My favorite cities in the world. Have you ever had molly's cupcakes? You're going to say molly, are you really into the cupcakes? Like you have this nickname cupcake. Is that real? What's weird? So recently, probably the last month I've been working with a new sports doctor Dr Edwards and he's changing my diet, which is great. So I've been eating more of a high fat diet, Ketogenic Diet and I've been staying away from a lot of sugars and stuff and I feel really good.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       So I haven't been mowing down the cupcakes recently. But um, in the past I've been known to put down, you know, a couple

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       in the moment you said Ketogenic, there's thousands of people listening to this podcast. And like, no, not again because it comes up so often because I've been doing it for five months. I've been eating nothing but that, that's how we eat, right. It's lost like 10 pounds. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:15:13       Brian's lost so much weight on this diet. Like his camp before, that was a struggle to get the weight down because it's really big for 1:35, he gets up to like one 65, you know, he can get up to one 70 ish. Yeah. Remember when he was making the cut the first time? Yeah. It was hot. Hard and. But this one you switched to that, you know, with a little bit of carbs. Obviously if you're an athlete you have to have some carbs. Sure. Do. Strictly fats and what not, but anyways, weight has flown off. He's way ahead of schedule. He's doing really good. So we're pumped about that and I mean shitloads of fats to and staying lean and healthy and I feel good.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       So like, do you do what, what protocol you're following? Like is it's like 60 percent fat, 30 percent protein, 10 percent carbs. Like do you need.

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       No, I'm not that scientific about it. I kind of just listen to my body and I just eat what I feel. I feel like I've been doing it so long that I just kind of have a natural sense. It's like if I'm hungry then I just choose to eat something that's more fat based than something that's the sugary or our carby like what kind of foods are you gravitating towards? So recently I've been so stoked about liver Mousse, liver Mousse, like yeah, yeah, they're delicious. So if you go to whole foods and you are the cheese section, they have these little packages of Moose liver and they have different flavors and I got like a truffled one. I think I ate almost the whole thing in one sitting, but they're not that big. I mean they're like, you know, but I mean it's kind of a lot of fat in the liver is really, really good for you. It's got like vitamin D and tons of vitamin C I guess more than carrots. Like liver has crazy amounts of vitamin C, so it's like a super food. And my doctor told me, I'm like, oh, whatever. I tend to like foods more when I know they're good for me to something like mentally in my brain just tells me this is good for you. You'd like it really

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       well, I guess if you train as much as you do, that does totally make sense. Yeah. And beets, beets, beets are grade for it. Yeah. Beet juice. Oh yeah. That sounds fantastic for your beet juice. Also, it mimics things like, um, the endurance properties of things like, um, a certain mushrooms if you take beats like rick or rich roll, who is a endurance athlete, was saying that, uh, he found like significant advantages in taking beet juice and that like blending beats and like a Kale shake or something along those lines really gave him like an extra boost in training.

Speaker 2:          00:17:33       Yeah. This is a little company called love beets. I don't know if they're little. They could be big love beets. You see a lot of, a lot of them. I'm at the whole foods too. They have like the canopies and um, how was doing UFC embedded in. I had beats on my salad and then they reached out to me like, oh, we saw she had beats on her salad. We want to send her out some beet juice. Like maybe it was, maybe it was, maybe she was having libido actually was love beets. And they sent me out this. Oh man, this shit is delicious. It's so good. And they're the one that's um, beats and ginger. They've that, oh my God, it's to die for. I love it. Anytime you can get like powerful natural nutrients like and they come in last two gen kind of like, I kinda got on that, that glass drinking out of glass instead of plastic.

Speaker 2:          00:18:18       I kind of got on that train a little bit. I don't know if you're around that yet. It's definitely smart. I mean plastic for sure can leach some chemical taste it sometimes in the water and I'm like if I feel like if I can taste it and our body's made up so much of water anyways, so I think with a better water you put in your body, it makes more sense. Right? For sure. Well the real issue I think is when people leave bottles of water, plastic bottles in their car and they heat up, we'll think about how they get transported. It's not like they're in a cooler. Very good point, you know? I mean, you drink, I'm cold. If it's cold, you don't taste the plastic as much so you, they sell it to you cold, he put it in the fridge and you drink your water bottle.

Speaker 2:          00:18:51       And you don't really taste it as much, but if you let it get to room temperature, just buying it from the story, probably you'll taste the plastic. I wonder if anybody's ever done any studies where they've taken to arrowhead water, Fiji water from the shelf and just test it and see how much. Yeah, that shit is in the actual water itself. Yeah. I wonder too, but I just. The fact that I can taste it sometimes, like I think I'll go with glass like more natural. It's better for you, right? For sure. So do you eat? Do you eat a lot of Avocados? Mct Oil, coq 100 percent mct oils I put, I've been digging this or you a tumeric and curcumin. Curcumin, the Dr Rhonda Patrick Show. Oh my gosh, you blew my mind. I've listened that episode like five times and I still have to go back over the fine tooth comb and write notes.

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       I just downloaded the second ones. I've listened to the first one like five times. So I figured I think I got enough of the information. Finally. She's so freaking smart. And then now I downloaded the one before the last one, so I'm about to listen to that one. Probably on the flight home. She spooky. Smart. Yeah. So she was talking about all that and my sports doctors is in complete agreement. So anyways, I don't know where I was going with that. What did you ask about eating? Oh, coconut oil, um, curcumin or turmeric and ginger. I make like a tea in the morning and I that I like blended up. So it's frothy and delicious. Speaking of not eating a lot of sugar though. We did. Um, I did use on a UFC tonight last night and then we did tough talks and the kid Kahleel we had a cupcake eating contest. Oh No. Oh my God. I was wrecked for the rest of last night because I haven't been eating sugar mad, you know, I'm competitive so I'm just going down these cupcakes.

Speaker 2:          00:20:35       So they, they gave me like smaller ones for the weight class discrepancy. So yeah, like, I know, but you know what actually it was kind of a disadvantage that appeal more of them spend time trying to peel them out. So I, I, I, I think I ate four and then my sofic is to shut and it was like, Eh, like no more swelling, another bite. So I shoved three more in my mouth and just like held them in the last sense because I was like shoving them in my mouth. So I think it was seven, but I spit three of them out. No. When you say your soft biggest shock, was it like you couldn't swap, did you have milk? I did have milk but there was just too much. There wasn't room for milk in my mouth anymore. It was just all cupcake. It was like, it was hilarious. The videos on my facebook page if you're interested in watching, it was pretty disgusting actually. What did you feel like after it was over? I felt terrible, honestly. Like I was like shaking. I was like, oh. It was like, I feel like I kind of had a gut ache was like this is a really good,

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       bad idea. Isn't that weird that you could have eaten those things like a year ago? No problem. And then I just now for many cupcakes and I'm feeling like garbage. I was on the Diet for a long time and then I had a cheeseburger and a malt. I got a big ass chocolate malt and I was. It was a huge. It was like that big. It was all sugar gets you. I was wrecked. I laid down on the couch. It is when you just get used to it. That's the problem. And when you're used to it, your body's seems like, ah, this is nothing. So when people, oh, here you are, who you are eating a cupcake.

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       My mouth is watch and I'm throwing. They're counting down. I'm like, Oh God. It's so gross. Disgusting. It's terrible. Like the referee outfit on. I couldn't. I have three cupcakes in my mouth. I know my lips are literally bursting. Like,

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       see if this was fear factor we would have made you swallow it and open your mouth. That's the only way accounts would have. Speaking of fear factor, I always wanted to do that show. I used to watch it all the time to talk to you out of it. I could eat that disgusting stuff. You think you could. I think I could. Well, you could probably eat some of it. I eat some of it. Really as I asked you, what was the most disgusting thing that they made some money. You think blended stuff is the worst, like blended bugs and stuff. When did pancreas and different. Disgusting like blended the spleens and there was some and you know what's really interesting is one of the ways we made things more disgusting was expensive cheese. Like if you go to, what's it called? A formal ga for Azure. Cheesy story, but go ahead and tell me. They will go to the Beverly Hills store that sells like super expensive, like Primo French cheese and it smells like donkey Dick. It's so bad. You open up the top of it and you go, what in the fuck is wrong with French people?

Speaker 2:          00:23:22       That's my. That's my disgusting stinky cheese story. It was in France the first time I went to Paris. It was over Valentine's Day and Brian and I were on this really beautiful dinner boat thing and you know, they bring out all this food and we're getting for grandma and like whatever, and they bring out cheese. I'm a cheese lover. I love cheese. I could never give up cheese. It's the one that I would, I would venture to say, you know, well especially now for

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       sure I'd picked cheese over cupcakes if I had to cut something out of my diet by buy cupcakes. Like I'm eating, I'm sticking with the cheese anyways. They bring this cheese on, there's three of them. One is fine. The other ones like it's a little stinky, but I think I'll try. The other one smelled like a rotting carcass. I kid you not, I believe you. It smelled like someone ran over roadkill and then they like. Then they served it up like two weeks later after it had been like an extremely soft. People eat. I'm like, what's wrong? I was like getting away. I wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole was in beverly hills where we used to send the people that worked for fear factor to buy it and they would walk by this place and they open the door and you'd be like, what in the fuck?

Speaker 5:          00:24:32       And meanwhile people are paying a lot of money for this thing that if it smelled anything like that, small, like I might've struggled to eat it. I've been with the same stuff. I mean I don't know what it was called. I would have to call my friend, just plugged my notes. I like to think I'd be able to eat anything. Is it? I Dunno. Well you're pretty mentally tough. That's the thing. I could get through it and was over. You probably blank out of your mind that deals with that and just go into the zone, throw it in and then you're like, am I good? Yeah. Then he'd run over to the garbage pail. That's what happened. I saw more people throw up and probably I would say like if you like look at me and like maybe catch cafeteria lunch ladies. We've probably seen the most people throw up in the world.

Speaker 5:          00:25:14       Oh, I bet. I've seen. I saw how fucking people throw up every week. I saw people throw it. I became completely immune to throw up. You I think would be more gross than the blended stuff. I feel like as long as there was enough liquid to be able to just swallow it, I think I get through it, but I think it would be hard for me as the like crunchy bugs, dirt easy really well for me because just like anything. Yeah, but it's not the taste, the texture, the sound, the sound of it. Like the shell crunching and then like the guts exploding. I don't know. We were just talking like this is disgusting topic, but that's like my. That's like that. Or the big old caterpillar's like where they pop in your mouth. Like hearing something like that I think is what would get me to eat a tomato horn worm.

Speaker 5:          00:25:53       That wasn't the best tasting thing in the world. That one popped in my mind. Those things. I think that would be a little hard for me, but it's nothing like that. Gum, remember that gum used to have the squirt center. It's good for your breath. You remember that stuff? Yes. They still have that stuff. I'm sure they do. That gum is like tomato horn worm. You pop it except it doesn't taste good when squirts. Tastes like, but it does. It's like neutral. That would be a struggle for me. That's just my thing. I don't know. That's my thing is like anticipating the pop or the crunch telling you you would just do it. I'm telling you nothing. The bugs or nothing. I was in Mexico recently and they were served crickets. The crickets. So like, like it was a snack that they left in a hotel like fried crickets.

Speaker 5:          00:26:36       I don't know. I guess if I could do it at my own pace and I like they were cooked crickets. I'd probably try one own peers and staff. The thing is, what would be the thing that you only have a certain time or one where they stuck with those spiders with like super long, long legs and it was like trying to crawl out of the person's mouth while they were eating it and like that was just like, oh my God, that would be a African cave dwelling spider. I ain't one of those two really. I eat a lot of shit. He's alive. He always threw it in there. Chewed up. Can I bite you? They tried really felt like a little pinch her on my lip but serious. But I am death. You just mounted down and I'm like, I got down on those cupcakes.

Speaker 5:          00:27:21       You imagine being a force, bartered some fucking gag for a TV show and someone's going to eat, you know. But um, yeah. The most bugs don't taste like anything. I bet the ones that are really bad or poisonous, they probably would fuck with you. Like if you had a black widow probably tastes like shit. Nobody ever had like a live snake or anything like that? No. No. Well we can't give any of the animals. We had, we did, we did do some stuff with snakes. It was really interesting what people would get upset about and what people wouldn't get upset about like p, the Peta would, they would get really upset if we did things with rats or things with rodents. Particularly problematic, but people didn't get upset about things with bugs. Like there's a really clear hierarchy that people have with life and people just don't seem to get that upset about bugs, but like certain animals take almost feel bad.

Speaker 5:          00:28:09       If I was to eat a live bug, part of me would feel bad. I don't know. What about lobster and throw lobster and a pot. I feel bad about that too. Oh yeah. I prefer to just kill it real quick first and then I'm fine with it. Yeah, I think they're meant to be eaten. I'm fine. Like with Hyundai doesn't bother me, but the, the idea of them may be experiencing extrusion, eat amount of pain before, like just just like seven in the head real quick and then it's done. It's dead. You killed it humanely and then eat it. No problem. Care about that. But they say the lobsters can't feel pain, but I say bullshit bullshit too. How do you know you're not a lobster? Have you ever been lot? No.

Speaker 5:          00:28:50       So I just say err on the side of caution. Just kill it. First used to go crabbing up in the San Juan Islands. We'd catch fresh dungeness crabs. Cook it within like an hour that they taste so much better that way. It's incredible isn't. Yeah. Brian can't eat seafood to save his life at all. Like he can't, cannot stomach it. Like you can't eat anything out of the water. Anything. Even like seaweed, anything psychological? Sure. I think part of it's psychology. He just doesn't like it at all. He thinks it tastes disgusting. Like the taste of the ocean. Like you get a lot in fish skin or like seaweed, like anything that tastes resembles the flavor of the ocean. Something watery. He hates it. Is He from Washington state too? So it was it like an overdose of fish because everybody's up there eating fish all the time. No, because he lived on the.

Speaker 5:          00:29:36       He lived in central Washington area. Right on the other side of the mountains, so it's a little more like grainy and dry and a little bit farther away from the water. But um, he ate dungeness crab. This was going to get back to, is that, that will have a crab that we caught that day and killed it and boiled and we had this sweet butter to debit. Well, yeah, actually. Like he ate it and was like, yeah, it was pretty good. Those was the only seafood thing he's ever eaten in his life that was swarming crabs on the seafloor. Why? Oh my God. Is that real? Thousands and thousands of crabs. You can even see the floor off the coast of Panama says, Holy Shit. What kind of crabs are these? Red, red crabs? And they just covering the floor like sand. That's insane. They didn't. When I think of when I read this, they said they didn't know what it was.

Speaker 5:          00:30:21       They thought it was just the moving sand on the ground until they got to put light on it. Then they saw that it was crabs. Wow. Are the little tiny crabs, is that what it is? They look like they'd be pretty big crabs are the cleanup crew. Crabs and lobster. It's interesting how good they taste when you consider what they do. They just basically eat rotten things that like sharks leave behind other fish leave behind. And I mean they're just the cleanup crew. Yeah. Were, were like, got to be grass fed beef, but we can eat, we can eat shit eating now. That's so crazy that brian doesn't eat any seafood because I would imagine that especially considering that he cuts through so much weight, like that would be like a good source of lean protein fish. His friends wanted to mess with them one time and he had like, he's at a restaurant and one of them had had salmon.

Speaker 5:          00:31:11       Brian's like one of those guys like does he want to look like if you're eating seafood, does he want it? He doesn't want to look. Yeah, he does. He just so like so grossed out about it. And um, so he got up to go to the bathroom and I guess I wasn't there. I wasn't dating but this, this was a long time ago, I guess they picked up a piece of the salmon and rubbed it all over the rib of his cup of milk and he smelled it and then threw it like he went to take a sip and he almost just see, just like lost it because he's. Yeah, he smelled it and I don't know. Did someone like force feed them a fish when he was a little kid or something? Oh, I kinda wonder if something traumatic had to have happened. Bravo's got a weird thing like that.

Speaker 5:          00:31:43       Onions, I'd give them onions. He'll fucking freak out. What if they're cooked? I don't think he can even eat them cooked. Really? Yeah. Apparently he had a douchebag for Stepdad. His stepdad used to make meat. So Vj and the uneasiness of each day to this day, like just freaking the fuck out of can of onions. Like everything on with that. Um, with chocolate flavor things. What's, yeah, what about cupcakes? No chocolate cupcakes really? Now I don't like, um, I don't like chocolate. I don't like chocolate ice cream I don't like, but I like milk chocolate, dark chocolate. No, I'm okay with this. As long as it's not anything chocolate flavor, it has to be real chocolate. Just, it can't be anything. It's such a weird thing. But the thing is I was really sick when I was a little girl was like five or six years old. I had a, like, I almost died. I went to the hospital, I had to get a spinal tap because all my veins had collapsed. I was so, yeah, I got really, really sick. What was it? I

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       had rye, Rye Syndrome. I don't know what that is. I don't remember exactly the details about why you liked the bread. I don't know. We never really quick. It's bad. That was killed. You have chicken pox and then I had a form of hepatitis hepatitis B. that's what I had all three at the same time because my immune system was down from the chicken pox and then I caught that and then I kinda have to add and um, yeah. So, so my parents took me obviously to the hospital and they couldn't, they, they, I had a phobia of needles for awhile too. They got an ivy and me barely. And um, you know, how like they're supposed to leave the ivy and you. And then they changed the tubing will the stupid nurse pulled it out and all my veins were so collapsed they couldn't get a needle in anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       So they would come in. I was just passed out. They would come in on the hour almost every hour on the hour and I would wake up to like 10 or 15 people holding me down. It felt like 10 or 15. I was five. It was probably like three people, but I just see lights and see will holding me down and they'd be trying to stick needles in the top of my hand in my ankles and the tops of my feet behind my knees like that. And they hold me down trying to get fluids in me because I couldn't keep anything down. And so finally it was so bad that they told my mom to like call it if she's religious, I call her pastor and like have him come. And like they were like, yeah, like she's gonna, you know, so they brought me in to give me a spinal tap and my God, it was the most painful thing I've ever experienced in my life because he take fluid out and epidurals, like I hear really painful too, but it's an injection as opposed to like removing the fluid, which is more painful.

Speaker 2:          00:34:09       I don't know. I remember feeling the most excruciating pain in my life and then passing out. I was so weak anyways. It was pretty terrible. I, it was back to the chocolate part of it before I went to the hospital, I was running such a bad fever and I was throwing up and my mom thought, you know, let's give her ice cream. And she had like some Neapolitan ice cream downstairs and she was like, they're really cheap. Crap. We didn't. I didn't grow up in, you know, with a lot of money or anything like that. We struggled. So it was like the cheap fake strawberry, the cheap vanilla in the really shitty cheap chocolate and I tried to eat some of those, the strawberry and the vanilla and I fell asleep and I woke up and I was really hungry and really thirsty and I went and the all the chocolate had melted so it was like a super bowl of warm ice cream and I took try to take a bite of it because it's just a little kid and I lost my shit. I puked everywhere and to this day it ruined it for me, like ruined anything chocolate flavored. What I can do, like dark chocolate, a real chart but has to be quality.

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       So if somebody brings you like a superbowl neapolitan ice cream right now and it just. Yeah, it's. Yeah, it is mentally fucked me forever. Look at the definition, Jamie. Pull that back up again. Please. Look at the definition of rise. Disease. I mean it's, look at this, a rare but serious condition that causes swelling in the liver and the brain liver damage perfectly. They said it was permanent. I don't know. Most often affects children and teenagers recovering from a viral infection most commonly the flu or chicken. That's amazing.

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       I've never heard no that. I never looked at it, but I knew that I had some liver damage. They actually told me to. It's been linked to this. So you have this use caution when giving aspirin to children and teenagers and that's exactly when. That's. That's why. Yeah, that's why that happened because my mom told me she called. She called the hospital and ask them like, my daughter has chickenpox, what should I, what should I give them, give her whatever, and they're like, oh, just give her aspirin, you know, give her some aspirin to help her with that. And that's what caused that. And then it was just bad. It was really, really bad. It was so weird that it's connected to aspirin. I wonder what the fuck. The fact, I didn't even know that actually, but I just know that like that I had that in, that had liver damage.

Speaker 5:          00:36:15       They actually told me that I would probably never be able to excel as an athlete because of that, because of your liver damage because of the liver and like, I don't know if maybe that's why I'm like, so maybe just show up and maybe I shouldn't blame, blame my, like my, my lack of, uh, of, of paying attention to situations and knowledge of things. I can never remember people's names. Maybe I will say I get punched in the head for living. Maybe it was that like brain damage and liver damage, all those things can be great. But if anybody said that you would never make it as an athlete told me like, yeah, the. Yeah, exactly. Right. The doctors were like, yeah, she's probably going to always have an, you know, an issue as an athlete to like to excel now. Have you ever got like a liver toxology toxology no examination or something like that? No, I never had. It seems like it'd be a good idea to do. My mom always told me she's like, you should do a visualization of your liver healing itself. So you said you had to like envision my liver, like growing moms? Yeah, it was. Yeah, she was. She never totally visually than anything else, but I remember that now this is bringing back memories. She's like, you should try to, you know, think about your liver being healthy. I don't know if it helps. We use now a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:37:20       Visualization. Absolutely beneficial means the mind has also to weird properties that we don't totally understand. That's why placebo effects work. We don't know why they work, but it does work. It's statistically proven that if you have a positive attitude and you believe something can help you, it can help you. But the problem with that is people use that as like an excuse for charlatans like psychics and palm readers and Tarot card readers and healers. Healers are a big one. There was a guy that was working with a bunch of UFC fighters back in the day that people would call like the witch doctor and this guy was like doing all these things. Do you remember George St Pierre? Um, not, not do remember, obviously. But do you remember George St Pierre? They had this thing that these do with him when they would like rub his back and rub his sternum, they had never understood that it was just shit that this guy had talked these people into doing like a bunch of fighters.

Speaker 1:          00:38:16       Like even fucking randy couture was going to this guy. Yeah, and the guy turned out to be a total Ho. I met him and I just felt like right away because I'm so used to hoaxers. I'm so used to being around bullshit artists and examining them as soon as you started talking about the Meridians of the body and this and that, and I was like, Oh, you're full of shit. You're full of shit. And you got deeper into these people. You're, you're rubbing on them and you're opening up their chakras. Old fucking for sure. You are

Speaker 2:          00:38:43       people that do the funny like ci videos, I feel like it's like a cold almost sometimes there's people in there like, you know, I can make someone flip over by just doing this or like whatever. They do the weirdest things and the people that that they convinced to, like it takes two to do that obviously because it's not real. So the person doing it and the person getting the move or whatever done to you have to have know that person has to agree to do it and then it's always so funny to me when you see them get approached by someone who doesn't believe in that at all and they're like, they're like, okay, do you have to me like, okay. And they really, they really think that it's gonna work and the person's just standing there and I'm like, no, it's not working. They're like, it's not working.

Speaker 2:          00:39:21       Oh you know it's going to work. They think is going to work, but given the bullshit artists thinks it's going to work or you ever see the guy that was like trying to chop a shop was, I'm not a pint of almost a pineapple, but a coconut try to shop, but like his hand, he was trying to set a world record. You guys should pull that video up. It's what his hand was. It bare hand. He's like a karate guy. He'll be like, chopped the boards. I think it might have to break a coconut with your hand. No, and it was funny because he had like a news crew there and he had like 20 coconut set out on like this, this bar, and he starts just hacking at one hacking at one hack. Anyone? Yes. And, and it's like, well you watch the video. It's hilarious. I'm going to have. I'm like, guy think that this would work. He's one of these guys. I'm telling you. You got a karate outfit on and look at it as a metal bar underneath that. So watch when he misses. Oh No, no, no. He misses, but yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       Oh, fail. He does this. Oh my God. He hits the fucking. Oh, fail. Fail. Oh my God. He hits them

Speaker 2:          00:40:25       like his hands hurting. Yeah, for sure. He had to pull away that he doesn't want to do it again. He doesn't want to, but he's like, I got to. And he's like, okay. No, she stepped in. Thank God.

Speaker 1:          00:40:35       Why was he thinking that that would work? Wouldn't you practice that before you got on television, but you imagine thinking that you would karate chop a fucking coconut open. How about just hit the earth in and wake up people in China? That's what I was saying. No. So yes, the mind is a very powerful thing where there's a gang of videos of these guys that are doing those key things on people and then their students fall to the ground and start twitching and there's a great one with this guy in Harlem had this, uh, like Kung Fu school and he had all these students and he, he's like doing all this like literally like Dragon Ball z type shit on them. Like they would have followed the ground and start twitching and spasming and it's like really shitty acting. But they are into it. I think when you're in a cult like that.

Speaker 1:          00:41:22       And that's what a lot of those martial arts are. There are a cult and I think almost all traditional martial arts have like attributes which can be beneficial, like the discipline and desire to please your Sensei or your, your Sabam name or whatever you wanna call them is like it's intense and you know, yes sir, and they bow and all this stuff and they really believed that their instructor cannot do any harm. There's a lot of good in that because it makes you have this really intense desire to succeed and this intense belief in yourself, but it's not realistic obviously and a lot of traditional martial arts and until the UFC came around, we didn't really know how unrealistic it was. Yeah. Well if you remember like Pat Smith when he fought that Ninja guy and like UFC one or two. I think it was UFC too.

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       I don't remember which one it was, but he fought some guy and this guy was doing these like in the. You remember they used to have the video of the guy training before the fight and the guy was like throwing all these techniques around a flip and people on the ground grabbing her neck and fucking karate chop at the top of their head and they fall to the ground and the UFC has come along way in a short amount of time. Right? I mean think about like football from 93 and then football in 2016 and kind of looks like football. Still the same, but the UFC in 93, like, look at it, it's like it's chaos, but Pat Smith was like a real fighter. This is the guy. Look at it. I just kept charging that Pat Smith and tried to. I don't know why I clinched up his name and math got on top of him and he just dropped elbows on them and smash this poor dudes head open.

Speaker 1:          00:42:59       It was awful, but that's 12 to six years. We're still allowed. Then 12 slash six is the dumbest fucking rule. Oh, here's this guy. Look at this and this is the best part about it. Pat Smith walks off and the fight is not done because he's a kind man for walking off because the referee is saying the fight still going on because. Yeah, yeah, because it's park. Yeah. That guy got smashed, but what's this guy's name again? Oh No. We don't even need to bring up this poor guy's name, but he probably thought it was big John Mccarthy. All lean and healthy looking. He probably thought that it was real. He probably thought that what he, what he was doing was real and he didn't know until he got in there with a guy like Pat Smith that what he was doing was just some malarkey. So Mall Strip mall malarkey.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       There's a lot of that out there still to this day. It's amazing. It's kind of makes you wonder sometimes as the world that we live in, it's like, well, it's that same. It's the mind, like the belief in what you can do when you can't do it can benefit you, but it can also fuck you up. Like he can benefit you if you're talking about your own health, like if you really believe that something's healing you, it can heal you, but there's like physical limitations, you know, like if you believe that Melvin manhoef can kick you in the liver and nothing's going to happen, guess what? That's not true. You can chop cooking. Oh, that guy. There's so many of those people though. So that was weird. First podcast I ever listened to of yours was a guy talking about a cult that he had been involved in. I can't remember his name either, but it was like, it was really fascinating. He's talked about his story and how they basically took him in and you remember. Oh yeah, Steve Hassan. Yeah, he's actually a, um, a cult. Is that how you say his last name? H S h a s s n

Speaker 2:          00:44:39       and fascinating man. He's actually a really warped as mine. Like that. He really got into believing that his family was against him and like now that he's removed from it, he's like, I was totally

Speaker 1:          00:44:47       my mind manipulated. Yeah. He's in the moon and he was in the moonies that's where, that's what he joined up with. Yeah. Yeah. That's A. It's a weird store because that guy now works to help people get out of cults.

Speaker 2:          00:45:00       Well, he should go help some of these c's height.

Speaker 1:          00:45:04       Gee People. I know you've, I'm sure you've seen the one with the old Asian man who fights the young karate guy. Have you ever seen that one? This guy, they show him with his students and he's doing all this stuff and they go flying across the room and their body twitches and he decides to have an actual no rules fight with his young Turkish guy and this guy just fucks him up, grabbed his shirt and beats his face in and high kicks. Um, and it's so brutal because the man looks like he's like in his late sixties. Yeah. It looks pretty old and not stout. And it's not like, you know, a healthy old 60 either. He looks like he's got a little potbelly and this dude just beat the piss out of him. And a got like a beating like that from a young strong guy who's much bigger than him to the guy looked like much stronger than him. Like that's not something that old guy is going to recover from. A key might be fucked forever from this. That's terrible. In his mind, he thought that he was going to fucking Kung Fu this dude.

Speaker 2:          00:46:04       Do you believe it? Like have you ever researched much about hypnosis and how I've been hypnotized? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Vinny shoreman and it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       Well Vinny shoreman. I don't know if you know who he is. He works with a lot of fighters. He worked with Joe Schilling. He's worked with a lot of MMA fighters and he does what he calls himself a mind trainer. And what he does is he can talk to you and put you in a state of mind. It's a very weird thing, like it's not what people think it is. It's not like take off your pants and my dick gets down like that. Like you're, you're aware kind of. But it's like an altered state of consciousness. It's almost like he puts you in like a. it's like you're under a drug or something.

Speaker 2:          00:46:46       So. So I, I just recorded a podcast. I just started my own podcast. And what is it? How do people find it? Mutated? Misha tate. Show the fuck out of here. What'd you come up with that name or. No? Starting to think about that one a lot. How about the cupcake? Our right, like I'm getting our. Yeah. Um, so I, I sat down with Mark [inaudible] who does a comedy hypnosis show 10 years on the Strip and absolutely fascinating when you think about the conscious mind and the subconscious mind and how the conscious mind really is kind of the tip, just the tip of the iceberg, but there's so much more beneath it and your subconscious mind is we're talking about how the power of mind and he says, you kind of go in and out of hypnosis states all the time. Like when you're driving and you start daydreaming or you're, you know, you're sitting, you just kind of space out.

Speaker 2:          00:47:27       You're not really looking at whatever you're looking at anymore. You're in, you're in a daydream or at night, you know, that's kind of a state of an awake hypnosis and that you can kind of go in and out of those yourself you do all the time during the day, but a hypnotists can kind of guide you into that and then plant certain good seeds, you know, I guess are bad seeds if they wanted to, you know. But I always thought of that too, like a Kooky guy that was going to make you do dumb shit while you don't know what you're doing. But that was fascinating to me because he talks about how he helps people who have phobias. For instance, someone who has a phobia of a dog. He's like, so fear is like one dog, this dog bit you and your child, you're scared of that dog phobia is this dog bit you and you're scared of all dogs. Now some people are so terrified they get these phobias. They can't even leave their house. Like they're so scared of the neighbor's dog walking by and going to jump out of anywhere and bite them. So they're crippled by these fears. And he could put them in a hypnotic state and kind of go back and remove that fear essentially.

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       That makes sense. I mean, I think that there's a, as he said, there's a bunch of layers to the mind, but I think that one of the most fascinating aspects of it is when they do those comedy hypnotism shows, those comedy hypnotism shows are 100 percent real. Like I've seen them live. Like there was a guy named Frank Santos was a big comedy hypnotist. Guy In Boston and his son still does it. Frank Santos Junior. But Frank Santos would do this show weekly show it stitches and all these comedians. We would come from like all over the town to watch this because we couldn't believe it. We were like, how the fuck is he doing this? And he would get people and he would know when they were under and when they were an under. Like you would know when people are faking it, when they weren't. He would get them off the stage when they're faking it. But the people that we're really under, you could see. They just were baffled. And I, and he couldn't explain why it would work on some people and why it wouldn't work on others. He didn't really know.

Speaker 2:          00:49:15       Yeah. I asked mark the same question because he, he, he'll invite as many people that want to volunteer out of the audience as you want. So he'll get 30 plus people up there and he'll just pick people off as they are, aren't into it. But he has people doing the craziest funny things, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       Yeah. And it's so funny. It's bizarre because you're like, how are all these people in on this? Well they're not. They really do like this. The Frank Santos used to have this person. This is like in the eighties, back when Madonna was hot. Like if you said you're going to have sex with Madonna now guys would go, Hey, what the fuck? That looks good for her age. For her age. That's the big part though. For her age. Yeah, right. She still looks great. I mean, no, but everyone knows even if she looks great, everyone knows that pitches like 60, like, you know, like I say bitch with all due respect this piano like a bad bitch, bad ass bad. But um, but you would watch him like he would talk someone into believing that they were having sex and Madonna and these guys have the orgasm in their pants. So like you'd see them go, like he would tell them and you know, and now you're going to come in your pants and you'd see the guy go, oh, when you're watching it, you're watching. You'd be like, what in the fuck is this real? You almost want to go, jude, I want to see your underwear. Let's

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       say it. Yeah. I want to see if it worked. It was, I can see the proof in the pudding, but frank tried to explain to us he had worked with people where it would help people quit smoking and things along those lines. But until Vinny shoreman did it to me, I really, I had no idea. I was like, I still haven't been hypnotized by fema to try it. It's going to be in the United States. I'll connect you guys together. You would like it because he's used to working with fighters and he's. He's great about like setting a mindset. I think Ian Mccall worked with them too, but he's great about putting you in a certain state of mind and working on various aspects of like maybe your performance or or your attitudes. Yeah. It's interesting. Well that's all about staying woke. Stay woke. He's woke you. I want some net achieve wokeness.

Speaker 4:          00:51:10       Super, super important to achieve wokeness. Yeah, I mean the mind is a really fascinating thing and I think that especially for fighters, I would have to say that it's just one of the most important aspects of your ability to perform. Like physically is one thing, but the ability to like you're inside the cage, the pin goes into the gate. Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on. I mean that is the craziest moment in all sports. There's no moment like that where you. I mean think about like a basketball player, basketball players. Even if there's a lot of pressure for a three point shot, if you miss that three point shot, you're going to get another shot somewhere in the game. Someone's going to hand you the ball. Luckily, or if not someone's gonna hang up all tomorrow or someone will hand you the ball next week, but if you say, if you fight, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:51:59       between team sports and individual sports too, for sure. I mean it's like when you lose, sometimes it's not unless you. The kicker on the football team and like you literally cost them but it. But it's still like a, you know, it's still a team sport. Your team, your team obviously didn't get you far enough to where you had to rely on that kick, but you go inside the cages is just you.

Speaker 4:          00:52:18       It's not just you, it's just you involved in the most humbling, dangerous, extreme version of a contest between two human beings. You can get outside of sword fighting, you know, outside of fighting to the death. There's nothing is extreme as a cage fight. When you guys,

Speaker 6:          00:52:35       I have to laugh when people say like that. We're scared to fight someone, you know, like people were like, oh, you're scared to fight holly again. Like you can't listen to those people. Scared is not a relative. Like it's not a term that I feel like fighters really. We don't, we don't have scared the way normal people have scared, you know? Yeah. Like a normal person would be scared to, to, to get off their couch and go to the gym, you know, to spar something like that's what we do. Like we live like what most people would shit their pants

Speaker 4:          00:53:05       and you would have to be a fool to not know that it's a dangerous fight. So it's not a matter of not being aware of the danger, but it's a matter of managing the consequences are like, I think you did a fantastic job with the holly fight, like literally you did in that fight other than the fifth round, which is the most amazing part of it. But you did everything. Like when we were about like what you have to do to beat her. I'm like, she's got to stay on the outside. She could have very her rhythm and she's got let holly come to her like she, she can't rush in because you rush into holly. It's like Russian into Machida are rushing to anybody who's a great counter striker and you saw the Rhonda fight. Ronda just came bulldog and honor and tried to out bulldogger and you just. You can't do that with holly. She's too fast. Footwork to her, her striking is so precise. Her, her counters are so clean

Speaker 6:          00:53:51       movements, very hard to read. Like it's very unpredictable. I remember what a couple times I tried to maybe come forward and get her to get to the fence and I couldn't tell whether she was going to jet out to the right of the left. Like usually like two steps back left and I was like, ah, you know, like I couldn't even tell like she had gave no indication of which way she was going to go.

Speaker 4:          00:54:08       Yeah. Well you just did a fantastic job of varying. Your approach to your speed was different. Like you, you, you did a lot of fainting, you varied things up a lot and you could tell like she was like almost like waiting for these moments to happen when you're going to come forward and then you wouldn't come forward and then it becomes like a test of patience, like who's going to get outside of their comfort zone, who's going to take chances? Who's gonna who's gonna engage. Yeah. And she also has that weird stance to was she kinda halfway stands like a boxer and halfway stands like a karate person. She throws like a lot of side kicks on the front leg techniques. Yeah, she, she's, she's a tricky one, but we put together a really good game plan. I was happy with that. Yeah, you did.

Speaker 4:          00:54:49       I was happy, but it was a fifth round. Fifth round was crazy. God, when you grabbed a hold of her and then eventually got her back and got her to the ground. It was so crazy because every aspect of, from your initial entrance to the takedown to getting her back, there was nothing. One hundred percent about it. It was all touch and go. It was all scramble. It wasn't like you had complete total control over like maybe like Damien Maia versus Rick Story. Like he daymond my gets rick stories back. He's got them locked up and then he anaconda asm and squeezes them and then it gets them. It wasn't like that. It was like you were fighting for your fucking life and you knew there was no time. There was no time. You were likely down by like at least one round and you were headed into the fifth and final round and maybe if you won that round you could have got the decision, but fuck, you're fighting the champ.

Speaker 4:          00:55:37       Yeah. Who knows? Who knows what's gonna Happen? You take our back and then when she tries to shake you off the top and you hang in there and you hang in there and you see what you like. And I watched them like, oh my God, she's going to go out. And when she went out and you climbed off her and she was unconscious like, Holy Shit, Holy Shit. What a moment. That was incredible. It was incredible. It was one of the best moments in all of women's championship fighting as far as like like an extreme, extremely dramatic moment where like you're, you're trying to accomplish something. She's fighting tooth and claw. Neither one of you are exhausted, so it's not like anyone's like physically compromised. It's just a fucking mad scramble between two killers and you get her and got her back and then you get back and you sink the choke and she's trying to fucking shake you off and you hung in there and when she rolled and you're on top of her and you, you, you hung onto it and you realize like, oh my God, she's going out. And she is. She didn't even tap. She was throwing punches in the air while you were choking her unconscious. I kept thinking

Speaker 6:          00:56:40       to myself, I'm like, when is she going to tap? It didn't in my, in that instinctual moment. I'm so used to, in training you get people in a choke, you know they tap. So I'm waiting for that tap and I'm like, God, like when is this girl going to tap? Like I know I've got her. What does she mean to, you know, tap on it and then, then I felt her, I saw her from my peripherals, kind of do, do something. I wasn't quite sure if she was tapping or what she was doing until I watched the video later and then I felt him pull me off and I'm like, that's the feeling that we fight for is that feeling that, that feeling of like I did it, I established my dominance, you know, it's, it's, uh, you know, as a prideful sport in some ways, you know, it's hand to hand combat with someone else. It's like, you know, I, I did it tonight. I was better

Speaker 4:          00:57:18       to be prideful because otherwise there's just certain sacrifices in certain fires that you're not going to walk through. Like you have to have every fucking motivation. You have to be Zen, but you also have to have an ego. There has to be so many things going on for you to achieve that highest level of greatness.

Speaker 6:          00:57:35       Again, on a tight rope, you know, people that are just like that perfect balance. You know, I'm walking between buildings that are, you know, hundreds of stories high or you know, and then it's like, it's, it's Kinda like that. I mean, you have to have the perfect balance and everything has to meet perfectly and that moment, including the training camp, not overtraining. Did you ever hear that video that the video is not that good? But the audio is, is awesome. It's between the fourth and fifth round and it's my corners, what they're telling me between fourth and fifth round. It's such an emotional video for me. When I watched it, it makes me relive that moment. And Brian came in there and essentially he was like, Misha, you've got to get after you got it. You have got to put your chin down. And Mike Tyson, this chick.

Speaker 6:          00:58:16       And that basically means just get after her, like, get, get in there, get after it, take the risk, risk getting knocked out, go for broke. And um, it goes, you know, plays into the round and basically you're just telling me fucking Mike Tyson her like get after her bulldog or do whatever you've got to do. Is that because you're running out of time, and I remember in that fifth round still trying to get out of that, that mindset of like, I to find the perfect opportunity. I have to be patient because the whole training camp was, you know, patient but persistent patient but persistent. No one run into anything because you, you know, you'll get caught, you get knocked out, you'll get need, you'll get kicked, you'll get punched. So don't do that, but you've got to look for the, the opening when it's the right timing, it's all about timing.

Speaker 6:          00:58:57       And after I took her down in that second round and I just beat her up that round, she was so. I'm so cautious in the third and fourth and so perfect, you know, her game plan was perfect to, to beat me, to stay just far enough out of the range and keep me from not wanting to come in. I couldn't find in a perfect opening. It couldn't get in on anything. There wasn't mistakes that she was making. And then in the fifth round I just decided, you know, going to have to, you're gonna have to take the chance of getting knocked out. This is, this is what it's boiling down to. Now you've got like three minutes left on the clock and now it's do or die. It's either you go in there, you, you go for it, you do Russian, she catches you, you get knocked out, you know, you gave it everything you got or you don't make something happen. When have finished the fight,

Speaker 3:          00:59:41       the question was really like whether the second round was a 10, eight round on all three judges score cards. It was, yeah, I was watching it. That's what the judges said. Well it should have been but. But what I'm. What I meant was the question watching. It was like I want like when we were, when you were headed into the fifth round with my question was, was I wonder if she got a ten eight round for that second round. Because if she did then this is like, this is even fight. So what's happening right now? Like what? How the judge is looking at it going into the fifth round. It was even. Yeah, it was tied. That's crazy. That was such a crazy moment. Does another time. The Indian, the postcode interview where almost cried like a bitch. I get so emotional. Yeah, it was, it was incredible.

Speaker 3:          01:00:24       Well, it's so hard to explain to someone when you're there and you, you, you get to see someone like you who's worked so hard for something for so long, you know. So when I said to you like, how does that sound? Like, what does it sound like? You're the new women's bantamweight champion of the world. Like what does that sound? And you were just so overwhelmed. It was so crazy. Like just to be right next to you while you were saying that and you said when you said, I'm waiting for you to say that for so long. It was crazy. It was crazy moment craze.

Speaker 6:          01:00:53       Yeah, because I, you know, what's crazy about the mind and the power of it. I've, I had visualized that moment so many times that I felt like I was confused in that it was hard for me to distinguish that that was the real moment

Speaker 3:          01:01:07       I would, I would imagine it was so. It was so surreal. I would imagine that to this day it probably seems fake cats. Really Weird.

Speaker 6:          01:01:16       Yeah. Sometimes I have to go back and be like, man, that really did. It really happened. It really happened right there. Oh, it's pumped,

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       Jay. Thank you guys. So excited. If you had like, if ours were real, you know, like fucking. If you had ci it was coming off your body for sure.

Speaker 6:          01:01:35       The whole, the whole state of fallen over in bed, shaking papers,

Speaker 3:          01:01:42       cups flying through the air and carpet would rip. Okay. That's gracious. Yeah. That was the best one. Best moments in my life for sure. I can only imagine. I can only imagine. I mean anyone that watches that sport, that moment when you choked her out and in the whole exchange of the. Well, even like the really the whole fight because fight is like. I mean in a weird way. I mean we call this martial arts and there's a lot of people that have a problem with that, but in my mind that there is an art to what you guys did in that fight and even what holly did because up until that fifth round mean like you said, especially the third and fourth. She was what she wanted to do.

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       She was shoes and there was a display going on. There was a, there was a performance going on on top of this being a competition to watch it. I, someone's sitting there watching it and calling it. I mean this is a work of art and to have it in that way which is such a masterful performance was such a masterpiece moment and that to me is like one of the best moments in mma because it's such a fucking hard thing to achieve to become a champion. And for someone like you had tried and tried again. He won the title in strikeforce and you're trying and trying again and trying to make this happen and you know, you think you're getting boxed out and then the Rhonda fight didn't happen after you beat Jessica. Hi. And then all of a sudden you have this opportunity and they comes to together in one of the most powerful ways we've ever seen inside the octagon. It was amazing. Well, thank you.

Speaker 2:          01:03:10       That was a, that was quite a great narration of everything that's had to happen to make this country, you know, and it, it's uh, it's crazy because it was 10 years, the same month, 10 years, the like the month, um, that I had had my first fight. Wow. It's been 10 years. Yeah. So it's crazy because you think 10 years ago there wasn't even a women's ever made was a joke. Like it was. I mean, to me it wasn't obviously, but to most people it was a spectacle at best. Something they kind of threw on the card is kind of like, ah Ha, you know, watch the chicks fight. You know, hopefully it'll pop out, you know, because they didn't respect us as athletes. You know? That's, that's what we, that's, that's the, that's the honest truth. That's the uphill battle that it was like nobody took it seriously. We didn't make any money. We were fighting for bread crumbs at best and kept you going during those times. The Passion, as Cliche as it sounds, I'm just the desire to want to be fulfilled and I felt like that was the most fulfilling thing in my life. It wasn't college. It wasn't, it wasn't. There was nothing else that was fulfilling.

Speaker 4:          01:04:24       But what is it about fighting that attracted you to it when there wasn't any clear future because you were in it at a time. Think

Speaker 2:          01:04:34       about the future. Too much early on now. I didn't think about it as something that was, this needs to be lucrative for me. This needs to be, you know, coming to some of it was I was probably three years into my career before I even thought that I could maybe like actually possibly make a living at this, so it was just something that I was doing to feel alive. Wow. Yeah. It was just something that I was doing to, to make me feel accomplished. It, you can't put a price on how something makes you feel, you know, a memory and experience happiness. You know, those emotions. You know, people say like the day that they got married, the day that they had their kid, the day you, those are like mile markers in people's lives. Like I guess if you ask someone on their deathbed, what were the moments that made you feel alive?

Speaker 2:          01:05:24       Like what did your life amount to what, what was that? Those key markers in your life? And all of my fights have been markers in my life that's more than most people can say. You know, so I guess it was such a sense of fulfillment and now the fact that it was so hard, it was, it was so hard and so many people were so against me. I think that made me really determined to. Because a lot of people, my Grandpa, my dad, my grandpa was really, he was chauvinistic to be quite honest. He was not, he was embarrassed that his granddaughter was a fighter and he would give my dad a hard time all the time, like, why you let your daughter do that? And he's like, don't let her do anything. She just, she's her own person. I'm not proud of it, but my grandpa, he's not.

Speaker 2:          01:06:03       But he, um, had a big change of heart when I, when I actually lost my title too, when I won my title against Marley's spoon and, you know, he really became obviously big fan, you know, he's very proud of you. I'm talking to my neighbors about you. He's like, I was wrong. And I lost my fight to Rhonda, right. Be Right when he got diagnosed with cancer. And um, that's eventually what passed away. Um, so I went straight from that fight down to see him, to see how he was doing and my dad was down there visiting. He lives in Florida so very, very far away. And I told them, I was like, Grandpa, I was like, I'm really sorry that I didn't win this, you know, when it makes me emotional. I was like, I'm sorry I didn't win this fight for you. And he's like, it doesn't matter, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:06:52       And I think that's the last fight that he ever saw unfortunately. But, you know, he's like, Hey, you had a lot of heart and so proud of you. So yeah. Were you attracted to other extreme sports when you were younger? No, because I wasn't raised that way. I wasn't raised with like extreme sports, like, um, yeah, my dad's still saw me as even segregate me, I wouldn't say, but he, he saw me as a, you know, it was a little girl, like he didn't take me four wheeling or um, you know, riding dirt bikes or anything like that. He took me down hill, not downhill mountain biking, but it kind of turned into that. We rode for miles out to a lake with my, with my little brother and a friend of his. And then um, I remember I was riding back and there was like big rocks and boulders and my dad and his buddy have have had downhill mountain bikes may for I'm writing like a little street bikes, but they're, they're expecting that I'm just going to be able to, like, I'll just carry down the hill or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:07:48       I try to bomb down the same rock hill. Them I eat shit like bad each and I still have scars on my elbow actually hear from, from when I, uh, when I fell and I just got up and my dad says, this is like one of the moments I realize you were different. He's like, you just popped up and you're like, frustrated was off. He got back on your bike, bombed down the rest of the hill and be all of us home. Like, you're just crazy. He's like, I never saw anything like that. I thought you're right that we were gonna have to like, you know, call, call medical help. And I thought [inaudible], he's like, you ate at heart, and it was like,

Speaker 4:          01:08:22       so it was just something that was just in you, I guess just deal.

Speaker 2:          01:08:25       I don't know. My mom always told me, and this something I realized when I was talking to mark hypnosis, he's telling me about how much children can be affected by people who are negative in their life with people who can, you know, you're never gonna amount to anything and how that can affect the subconscious mind. You know, having a dad who's like, you suck, you're terrible. You're never gonna be, you know, you're never gonna be anything. How that can create crippling ripple effects that, that translate on all the way through the rest of that person's life. And I said, well, what if it's the opposite? Like what if you had a parent that was telling you that you're amazing all the time, that you could do whatever you want and they really true heartedly believe in you. He's like, Oh yeah, that can, that can be amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       You know? Amazing too. And it made me start thinking because my mom and I, we've had a really rough relationship the past three, four years or so, maybe, maybe longer. It's been a struggle. We're, it's getting better, but I will give her a ton of credit that as, as a single mom for part of my life growing up and even not single, she, she never made me feel like I wasn't capable of doing anything. If I, if, if anything, she always made me feel like I could be and do whatever I want and I could be the best at it. Like most people when I would go five, six, seven, eight years old and I want to be an astronaut. Like every little kid, they're like, yeah, yeah, you know, Oh, you know, on my grandpa was the first one to be like, that's not realistic. You're not going to be, you know, not going to be. Actually my mom was like, no, you will just like, you will, like, if that's what you want to do, that you will. It's like, she's like Misha, whatever you want to do, you will be the best at it.

Speaker 4:          01:09:57       Well, I think it's probably good to have both. It's probably good to have someone who wholeheartedly believes in you and someone else who's like doubting you. Sort of like a little motivation to prove them wrong. The other person rise. I, I feed off of that. I love proving people wrong. Love it. You're a very even tempered person, which is very unusual for a fighter. You're very feminine, but you're also very flat and very relaxed. You're very like, this is Meesha. Like this is how you are like it was when you were on the ultimate fighter with Rhonda. It was when it was highlighted the most because she's so manic. She gets so hot and it's one of the reasons why people love her so much. She gets so fucking crazy and she's so competitive and angry that like when you guys did that wall climbing thing and that she's like, fuck you, and she's giving you the finger. Like you're just like you just your level the election, but how has that. When, when did would. Was that your whole life you're like that? Or is that something you learned how to do?

Speaker 2:          01:10:55       Pretty easy going my whole life. The thing is I don't like to be stressed out and I don't like to be pissed off and I don't like to not be happy, so I do everything within my power to not be stressed out. Like I can be about to miss a flight or has something. And I'm like, well what can I do now? You know, I'm just like, it's sometimes it's a bad thing because they don't plan ahead enough or I'm not really good with time management because I don't want to be. I don't ever want to rush. So even if I'm late to something I don't like to rush, you know? And it just, sometimes that's a bad thing. I'm not the most organized person because I'm so relaxed about everything. Then I'm like, no, my taxes, I'll do those later, you know, like that kind of thing.

Speaker 4:          01:11:34       It sounds like a great recipe for life though. Is It on both ends? No one does it this way. Seems good.

Speaker 2:          01:11:41       Yeah. You know, I, I, I save save all my tension and stuff I guess for when I get inside the cage, but I like to be relaxed. I just like to be shown. I don't like to be pissed off. I don't like to be stressed out. Like what a miserable life. I feel like, you know, some people are just angry all the time. Like, like they're like perma scrooge, you know, just all the time angry. I'm like, do you not even realize how bad your life must suck? Like what if, if you just looked at things differently, you'd have a way better life. I'm like, I never want to be that person.

Speaker 4:          01:12:08       I remember Mike Tyson when he was in his prime and they asked him about something and he was talking about being angry. He's like, I'm angry all the time. I'm angry at my dog. I'm angry at everybody. I'm angry. The mailman just get the fuck out of my way. Like when he was in his prime, he was just a ball of fury, you know, he was just this wrecking machine, which is like a lot of people associate that with being a championship level fighter, like almost like you have to have a certain level of discontent, you have to have a certain level of anger to motivate you. But with you, I think if you could look at like a person's graph, like a sound graph of how they speak their whole life. Mine would be all over the fucking place, going up and down and be all crazy and.

Speaker 4:          01:12:49       But Yours, I feel like it'd be like this like flat up in little tiny ups and downs, like very minor ripples, like, you know, like a little bit of like a flat lake where the water comes in a little bit, but it's nothing fucking crazy. There's no tidal waves. No. No chaos, no tsunamis, but you're just flat and steady. I try to be, not always, I'm still a woman, but that's usual for a fighter, right? This flat level sort of way. And I say flat. It almost sounds like a pejorative and I don't mean it that way. I mean like a Zen, like you have a very zen thing going on.

Speaker 2:          01:13:27       Yeah. And that's, yeah, I used to have issues with anxiety a little bit when I was in high school and I would like have my track meets and something and I would have anxiety attacks. I actually have a problem with it and I guess I've always been a very open minded person and I always asked myself questions whenever there's something wrong with myself or you know, an issue that I'm having. I asked myself why am I having that, you know, and then, and then it comes full circle and I was able to answer those questions in and then I have never suffered from anxiety since I. So I kind of put myself in a zen state of mind early on in my career because I hated it so much. It's like you don't want to live having anxiety issues. Like why do I have that?

Speaker 2:          01:14:02       Why? Why? What am I afraid of? You know, it's like, well, I'm not, I'm not afraid enough to where I'm not going to do it, so let's just not make it a big, not make it something I don't like. Obviously I do like it. That's why I'm doing track. Obviously. I like MMA. That's what I'm doing it. I don't want to make it something I hate. I don't want to make it something I don't enjoy because it's not. So that's not why I do this. I do this because I love it, so let's not make it something I hate ever. I try not to. That's a very rational approach though. It's very unusual for people. Yeah. Like there's nothing in this life, like if I want to do it, that fear is going to stop me. Fears are realistic thing. It happens. Yeah. It's scary to get into the cage.

Speaker 2:          01:14:37       It's scary to think about losing weight and I've tasted the most bitter losses you could ever dream of and it's devastating. It's crushing. That's the most scary thing. It's not getting beat up. It's not breaking your nose or breaking my orbital bone or letting my arm gets snapped in half. That's not the scary part about fighting and what I do. The scary part is not being adequate enough, not being good enough that you're 100 percent wasn't good enough. That's scary. That's really scary. And um, I've had that. I've had to face that point blank right in the face many times before. And it's the hardest thing to do. Bar none. It's the hardest thing to look at yourself and be like, I didn't, I wasn't enough. I wasn't enough. No one else can be responsible for that. I fucked up. I didn't do it. I have to own this and to come back from something like that and think that you can still, you can still get it back or you can still do it again or you could still get better.

Speaker 2:          01:15:31       You can learn from that. That's, that's also the challenging part of it, you know, and that's something that I've, I've had to, to get to this point, I've had to get over those situations where I thought that my world had ended. You know, my second last or Rhonda was the most devastating. The first loss was devastating. The second loss was a, like, it was horrible. I thought my world was, was coming to an end and you know, and nobody cared about my family and friends, but the rest of world, they don't care. I don't give a shit. They don't care about second place. They don't care, you know. And um, they're mean. People are harsh. They're mean on social media. You have to get thick skin quick. Nobody teaches you how to deal with that either. There's no mma, social media, 101 or like you don't, you just sink or swim, you figure it out or you don't either bothers you or doesn't, you know, either you yell back at everyone or you don't. You know,

Speaker 5:          01:16:20       like when you're in the first generation that's ever had to deal with. Yeah. So there's never been anybody in the last 10 years. Is it new occurrence and they don't teach you how to, how to deal with it or how to not let it affect you emotionally? No one knows. No one knows. I mean, this is a total new field learning experience, especially for someone who does what you do, which is the most exposed an athlete ever gets ever like if you lose a tennis match and the world says, hey, you fucking suck at tennis or whatever bitch move on with your life. But if you're like, you know, Rhonda beat you again, you fucking dumb hoe. And you're like, oh my God, I can't believe this. People so goddamn mean. And it's fighting. It's like the most primal thing. So everyone, what other sport or sports always buyout boiled down to and they don't like another person is

Speaker 2:          01:17:04       fighting. That's like the most primal way to deal with something. So once your sport is fighting, people like feel like

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       that more justification to talk shit, even though they're just like, Gosh, I have to laugh because Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier, when we were in New York, they opened up the questions to the audience. I big mistake because these little pipsqueaks they got on the microphone. Or like, I'm so Daniel Cormier, I just want to say I have a really important question for you. How is it going to feel when Jon Jones kicks your ass again? You know, and I'm just like, you idiot. Like if you were, you wouldn't have the balls to say that if it was just you and Daniel in this room and no one was going to know the outcome of what happened after you said that. Well, the fact that people feel so safe that they can, can do that killer like Daniel cormier and then they did the same thing to John Jones. Did you ever see what they did?

Speaker 1:          01:17:55       The Rashad Evans, Rashad Evans, was that the photo signing and this guy comes up to him with a picture of, you know, there's an iconic photo of when Leo knocked him out or he's like kind of crumpled up against the cage and this kid, this little skinny kid with a smile on his face wanted Rashad to sign that and we shot a crumple it up and threw it out. I'm and looked at him like, are you out of your fucking mind? Like, do you know what I could do to you right now? Like he tried to hurt my feelings and try to make me feel bad trying to punk me in front of people while you have a camera on me because you're filming it, like your friends are filming this reaction to you sticking just his callousness and also just being oblivious, like oblivious to like, why would you want to do that?

Speaker 1:          01:18:37       Why would you want to say that to John? I don't get it. Why is he so dummies grow up watching pro wrestling and they, they don't understand that this is real. Like you, like you say hello, how's it going to feel to get your ass kicked again? What started that? Like they were expecting like some fucking fake thing. It's like he's just oblivious to the idea that you're hurting someone's feelings for no reason and you can also get caught up in it emotionally. Like, you know, people get caught up. Like I watched conor Mcgregor's social media after Nate Diaz beat him and Holy Shit I was, I was saying to my friends, I'm like, I hope he stays off line for a few days. Just don't go anywhere near a computer for like a solid week. Oh yeah. Because it's just the cons, the concept of the world. Just the deluge twice for it.

Speaker 1:          01:19:26       Oh, they love it and they hate their own lives is the thing is that nobody wins in our sport forever. Like so. You're always. You're going to have to face that at some point. It's one of the most exciting things about it is that it's so volatile. Like the Chris Weidman, Luke rockhold fight to me is like a perfect example that I often. I see Chris Weidman training or watch videos of him training. I'm like, what is going on in his mind right now? Because Weidman was so dominant and you even in that fight, incredibly competitive and he throws one kick. One crazy. We'll kick one ill advised we'll kick rockhold takes him down and smashes him and I just wonder like, how much does that kick haunt him? How much does that haunt him?

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       Like how might what? What is going on in his mind? Well, here's a guy who destroys Anderson Silva. Beats the fuck out of Leo Machida. Vito Belfort smashes him in the first round, you know, you watch his fights and you just go, okay, like, what is this rockhold fight going to play off like, and then when rockhold beat them and beat them down the way he did and destroys him, like, oh, we have a changing of the guard here. Like these moments, these pivotal moments of like, your whole life changes you go from being Chris Weidman, UFC middleweight champion of the world, one of the best fighters in the planet to Chris Weidman, former UFC middleweight champion of the world now hoping he gets a shot at his title in a rematch and now that he's got it and it's going to happen soon. It's like, whoa. That the drama and the buildup, like I can't imagine being him right now, like the tension that he's under right now and the pressure and what, uh, how much emotional connection he has towards this attempt to win his title back and how intense it's going to be once they get in there.

Speaker 6:          01:21:06       Yeah. And they're really starting to not like each other. The last time I was here for Fox, I think it was about a month or so ago, they were, um, they were there and there was some tension. Of course they were in studio and you could tell Chris was just a, he was not, he was, you know, he's pissed. He's not happy with the situation and Luke rockhold is kind of like, you know, he's happy, he's got the belt and he was kind of boasting it around a little bit and he's kind of ribbing Chris, you could tell like trying to get under his skin a little bit and Chris is like, you know, you could just tell he was like upset, like they were kind of friendly

Speaker 3:          01:21:39       before that, which is weird. Yeah. Yeah. They were friendly before that, like for a long time, like there's photos of the two of them together, smiling and not anymore. Well, when a guy beats you down like that, like, and you lose your title the way Weidman did. Yeah. But Brock holds fucking good. He's fucking good.

Speaker 6:          01:21:57       I saw holly, um, once instance a fight and I was really actually kind of nervous about it because I was like, she was, um, at the Jones osp fight. Those just happened. And um, we were both of the VIP party and my friend Heather Clark used to train heather. Joe Clark actually fighting this weekend in Rotterdam. Anyways, she was like, you should go and talk to him. I was like, yeah, I want to. I just, I don't want to come off. Like, how, what do I say? Bitch? What do you say to someone that you just, you took the dog, say hi. That's what I did, you know, I just went up and was like, you know, how are you? And she like, she came out and she was like, no, I'm just really bombed it in and get that rematch. I'm like, I know. I was like, don't worry. I was like, well, we'll see each other a future. She's like, yeah. She's like, I hope so. I hope you still have it. Just like, you know, I wanna I wanna see you again in future. I'm like, yeah, I totally get it. I've been in her shoes before. I know how bad that sucks and she wants that back, but we were friendly, but it's

Speaker 3:          01:22:50       using her. Both of you are so nice. Like holly is one of the nicest people. Nice. She's such a sweetheart. Meticulously Nice. If you didn't know she was a fighter, you'd be like no fucking way. And then he finishes a 19 time world boxing champion. Be like, what the fuck are you talking about? How's that possible? How's that? Nice killer.

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       Some tomfoolery. It just doesn't make any sense. She doesn't fit the mold either. Like both of you guys are really interesting representatives of MMA and great representatives because you break that mold. You know

Speaker 2:          01:23:19       her manager though? Oh yeah. Who is he? I don't know. I don't even know if I've ever met him in person. I probably haven't. Maybe I have. If I did, it wasn't memorable. Anyways. Um, I guess he went, like Dana went down. So Dana, Dana told me this. Dana went down to albuquerque before this fight ever came together of her and I. Right. And he said, look, you guys need to wait for Rhonda. Trust me, that's the big money fight. That's a fight. You want to wait for him? He went down there. He told me this, my face. He went down there to tell them don't fight me. Should take like they didn't want to give me. The UC did not want that fight to happen. They wanted the rematch should be the first fight and holly's manager told him we want me should tay. And Dana said he threw up his hands and was like, are you fucking kidding me? He's like, she's been the baddest, you know other than Rhonda for years now, and you want to take her lightly. You think you're just going to walk there. He's like, yeah, we got this. Like she's going to be a tune up fight. Who's her manager? I don't even know his name. Okay, I know these idiot. But then he told Dana that, that they, that they thought that I was going to be a tuneup, fight. Well

Speaker 4:          01:24:21       for get crazy. People get crazy. Look, look right. As people go crazy too. Everybody gets crazy. People get crazy. Like why did Rhonda charge after? Why? Why did she try to stand with, with holly like that and charge after it? That's not the right attempt.

Speaker 2:          01:24:35       Right. But she did a page, so page was also at that VIP party and Paige and I have spoken with were friendly, don't know her that well, but anyway, she felt the need. She came up to shit, Nisha, Nisha. She's like, I have to tell you this experience I had with Rhonda and I'm like, Oh, what? And she's like, well we're at a reebok deal just recently. And um, she, she's like, we were at a shoot and she's like, I was trying to find her so we could get a picture and the reebok people were like, don't ask Rhonda for a picture. And she's like, why? She's like, just don't do, just stay away from Rhonda. Don't ask her for a picture. She's like, okay. And I guess Rhonda came later that day and like seek her out and there's like cussed her out. Like they've never really had a conversation either.

Speaker 2:          01:25:16       She's like, I don't know Rhonda, like, you know, other than hi bye. That's it. Like I guess she came up, it came up, I was like, fuck you, you fairweather bitch, how dare you cross me ball washlet cross you, what are you talking about? And she's like, you congratulated Holly Holm for beating me, so fuck you, you fucking fairweather 115 pounds. I was just like, went off on page and page game he told me and I was like, honey, welcome to my world. She's like, oh my God. She's like, I'm glad that I saw this side of her. So I know, you know, I'm like, well. And she's like, you know, because I didn't understand. She's like, I told Rhonda like, I'm sorry if I offended you but you're not allowed to congratulate whoever I want. And um, she's like, because, you know, I congratulate a rosen. I'm a unit. When she beat me, I was like, congratulations, you whoop my ass was a bad

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       ass performance. And she's like, you know, I just simply told holly, congratulations once again, like, it wasn't anything, you know, anti Rhonda, but Rhonda gets just ripped her nuon wow. Like you have to be on team Rhonda for life. Yeah, I guess I've never been on team Rhonda, some all or none. No,

Speaker 1:          01:26:24       that was crazy. I mean, people love both ways. It's interesting like people love your way, but people also love like shit talking, you know, people love Nate Diaz for that and people love, they love the drama, but they also love someone like you a hugger. I'm somewhere in the middle though because I get a lot of flack for

Speaker 6:          01:26:44       no my mouth like, so you just can't go. I say what I'm thinking and I'm, I'm pretty transparent and sometimes people think that, you know, I get a lot of flack, oh you're fake or this. And I'm like, not really like, just because, you know, I'm like, I'll say like I'm a fan of Connor, I am. I like his fighting style and his antics at first were kind of like, wait, who is this guy? What is it? You know? And then I'm like, man, props to him. He's done amazing things like good for him and he's done really good things for our sport. But when you didn't show up to film that commercial, like I'm not, you know, I'll be honest like yeah, I kind of rubbed me the wrong way because people are like, oh, he does so much more media than you guys do.

Speaker 6:          01:27:20       Yeah, I'd probably does. You know, they probably does. I do a lot. He probably does more. I agree. But I don't have a private jet flying out to pick me up and bring me back and fly 20 people in my crew with me too. He does more. So he gets more when they bring them to Vegas, they put them up in a penthouse, you know, they make sure he has everything that he needs. I don't get that, you know, that I'm, that's fine. You know, he's earned that. He's in that spot. No problem with that. But I think three months out from a fight camp, you know, you have a private jet coming to pick you up with. You can bring one of your teammates. You could probably work out on the jet if you want to, on the way there because it's yours, it's private.

Speaker 6:          01:27:52       Do whatever you want. Right. You could probably hit mental agenda. You could totally, you know, I mean, you're three months out and you don't want to show for your media obligations. Like I don't really understand that. I don't like it just, I don't know. I guess I'm trying to figure it out, but the only issue that I had and it, it doesn't bother me. Like if he didn't want to do it, that's his own thing. The thing is, is that I showed up the day to film the commercial and I had two segments I was supposed to film and that's all that was on my schedule. And then they asked me. They're like, can you please help us out because Connor's not here and uh, we don't know what we're doing for this third segment of the commercial that was supposed to be conor and nate.

Speaker 6:          01:28:28       So can you please come back later that day and film that segment Muslim, that was during my practice time. So I had to come back and you know, I did it. So it was a company woman, but like it was just frustrating because it's like Dang, you know, if I had known about this, I could have planned my training otherwise, but now I kind of have to like scramble to get my second workout in and then it affected me. So yeah, his decision did. And it probably is actually, you know, I haven't made any more money in the sport yet because of Connor. A lot of people like to like, oh, you must have got a bigger payday because I last, I'm like, no, because I wasn't the champion so I didn't get any more of like get any paper views. I get any more money and now he's like not on this fight card. So I'm like, you know, but it's whatever, you know, it's, it's connors deal and uh, I, I don't hate connor, but I'm going to say how I feel, you know? And I would say it if he was sitting here too. I'm like, dude, why did you do that? You probably,

Speaker 4:          01:29:17       I feel like there's a bunch of issues here and we are the only way to really get a firm understanding of it is to sit down with everyone involved and say what was communicated your manager? Did he know what the, what the appearance schedule was going to be like? Did you guys agree to this? Did you understand what you were getting into when you were fighting? Maybe it's a misunderstanding, you know, who knows? It's hard to say, but it's the way he went about it was ridiculous. Like saying I'm retired, thanks for the cheese. And then saying I'm not retired. And then saying I'm glad the UFC decided to give the fans what they want and be, I'm going to be on UFC 200 numbers. Like what? And so like what he's doing is he's kind of like using the media to try to get this thing to pass through, but he doesn't understand Dana and Lorenzo and frank, like that's never going to work. Like you're, you're either in or you're not in like. And they're like real clear about that. They have to set a precedent. So like if you say fuck you, I'm not doing media that kind of go oh well okay fuck you, you're not fighting, but hold on, I'm conor mcgregor where the UFC, this is what it is.

Speaker 6:          01:30:25       My name is Doris, don't make many more

Speaker 4:          01:30:27       and we might lose millions of dollars because you're not on UFC 200.

Speaker 6:          01:30:29       Yeah, well he, he, he had put, they put 10 million ended up promoting this Saturday 10 million and he's like we're way over budget, you know. So that's why I was like you've got to show up and do you know that's how connor was made is through that stuff. So now like at what point do you get to decide that you don't have to do that anymore? Like if that's what made you who you are like I mean don't, you kind of have to like, does that make sense what I'm saying? I mean at what point do you get to decide like when you don't have to like, like I use the machine and now like I don't, I just want to hop off now that I'm here. I don't know. Do you kind of have to keep it the same boys?

Speaker 4:          01:31:05       I think so, but there is also like a fine line, right? Like you can do too much. Like when I was watching the Jose Aldo media tour when they were going all around the world, I'm like, okay, I understand that you want to promote this fight. Yeah, but how much of this is helping the actual fight itself and then how much of it is just conor mcgregor constantly talking Shit at press conferences and grabbing the belt and all that. That mean that's really kind of selling the fight. Was that. I don't know. They did a lot of it, but apparently connor was sick. Like he was like, I'm just constantly fighting off a cold is really hard to get in shape. Really hard to train because every week you know you're traveling from here to there and they already here. It's just you're constantly getting beaten down and you know what it's like if I give you ever. Have you ever flown into Brazil and fought? No. I fall in there for fight cards though. What is the furthest you've ever had a flight of fight? Japan? Japan. So that's an interesting one because it's a long flight, like 16 hours, right?

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       What is it like? Like, like adjusting and then competing? I try to

Speaker 6:          01:32:06       started adjusting my schedule at home, like black and white windows a little bit or you know, like to, to make the timeframe but you'd never get fully adjusted. But the, my mind frame is like when, when push comes to shove, when fight time comes, whether it's two in the morning, my time or not like I'm going to be game so I would just look at it that way but it's not fun. Like I remember three weeks out from my fight with Retina Chi, which I didn't even want to. I didn't want to do that fight because she was so unknown. She was undefeated. I'm going over there to fight on a newly blooming fight pass and I was like, this is like, feels like it does nothing for me. And like if she wins it, springboards her, you know, then she'll be 17 and no shove a judo background.

Speaker 6:          01:32:42       They're going to want to make that fight for, for her and Rhonda. I know that's what they're trying to do is they're trying to use, you know, business use me as that springboard. It's like I don't really want to use but I did it but three weeks before the fight they had me fly to Japan to do some promotional stuff and I was flying longer than I was even on the ground and they said like ticket sales went up and everything was really good. But yeah, that was exhausting. So I do, I understand that before. Yeah, that's hard. Really hard. Really hard. Ramping it up three weeks in super hard and after my fight with holly I got to spend a little time in Australia and then I went straight from Australia to New York. Spent a day there, did a full day of media, went to Connecticut to espn, did a full day of media, what to Toronto, did a full day media and it's just like, it's non stop from like you start your first interview at eight in the morning so you have to pick up at like seven and you go until seven at night and even while you're driving to the next place they'll have you on the phone.

Speaker 6:          01:33:39       Was with the, with the, with uh, you know, with a radio interview, you know, I mean there's no break. It's all, it's, it's pretty intense. It's pretty crazy. It's pretty exhausting. So I get it. I've been in those shoes before. But um, you know, it's, I don't know, maybe there's more extended research. Maybe he was hurt or something. Maybe you didn't want people to see like maybe I don't know, like what if there's even something like that. Like what if he had hurt himself or something and he didn't want nate to know.

Speaker 3:          01:34:05       Yeah. Who knows? I don't know. Who knows? And it's also, he also had to realize there was a lot of work that needed to be done to beat nate. Yeah. Like he's hitting eight with some of his best shots and nate was fine with it and it was a real problem.

Speaker 6:          01:34:19       That's more what it was, is that he was just obsessed with beating nay and I, I get that too. I don't take that away from him for a minute. Like he wanted to stay home and. Or he was in Iceland I guess training and he wants to train to be nate. I get it. Totally get it.

Speaker 3:          01:34:32       Yeah, I get it too. It seems like the only way also I felt like. But then again he could have brought us whole gym with him, you know? Sure. We could have tried. I mean it was going to be a difficult time just trying to find the moments to train and to stay in shape. And then obviously being exhausted from flying and all that jazz

Speaker 6:          01:34:49       turnaround too. You know, like as far as. Well I don't think he was supposed to be there more than like two days. I

Speaker 3:          01:34:56       honestly think he's better off not doing

Speaker 4:          01:34:57       it. I honestly think he's better off like sequestering himself for a few months, like really focusing on what went wrong, how to correct it and can you correct it? I mean, do you like when it comes to the ground game, what I saw on the ground, I was like, boy, this is a long road. Like you've got a long road to beat. A guy like nate, he's so much further along in, in and ground and pound Jujitsu, positioning everything. When I was watching nate beat them up on the ground and choke him, I was like, whoa. That happened quick. This is not like Weidman and rockhold was a prolonged beating before rockhold eventually stopped him the next round. Yeah, but with why with nate and connor wasn't that prolonged. It happened pretty quickly and when you see that you go, Ooh, this is going to be. There's a lot to overcome.

Speaker 4:          01:35:48       It's not unsurmountable takes. A lot of times the skill sets, they don't just. They don't come overnight. You don't. He can pick up your cardio pretty quick. You can do a lot of things. You can't, you can't build a skill set any faster than it's going to go through your muscle memory and being Rep. you've got to put thousands of reps in and there's no way around it. There's no way. There's no way to fast forward through that. There's no way to cut the corner. There's no right. You can't just repetition, repetition, repetition would also. It highlights all the various eccentric aspects of your training that people are like, hmm, is this what makes connor great? And you know, and then, you know, nate calling it touch button, the park, like the dude, all these cartwheels and stuff. Then video is so funny. Hilarious. Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          01:36:30       I was dying laughing. Clarius. So when this all, you know he's doing all these work with this movement guy, but then you see what happens when it actually comes to fighting skills and you go, oh, maybe this is not the way to do it because like I've talked to a lot of people that were like this stuff that he's doing his utter horse shit like this. Doing cartwheels and being obsessed with movement. Here's the movements you need to be worried about. Okay. Moving your feet, throwing kicks and punches. Take down defense and Jujitsu on the ground. That's it. You know, understanding takedowns yourself, taking people down if you must, trip sweeps, all that stuff. But all this cart wheels and what this guy was explaining to me, and I want to name any names because they're prominent guy. He was like, you have to understand that there's a limited amount of energy you have in your time training and you are not perfect at all of these other aspects of mma.

Speaker 4:          01:37:27       So if you are not perfect all these other aspects of, uh, may you have to say, okay, how much. Yeah, how much of this stuff is going to help me? Will a guy like George St Pierre, he looked at gymnastics and he was like, you know what's going to help me because I can be stronger physically and there's no better way. I think like as far as like manipulating your body than gymnastics, like doing the rings and developing a perception. Yeah, you're learning how to manipulate your body and all kinds of contorted positions being upside down and understanding where you are

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       when you're upside down and where you're going to be with the momentum you have. You have to calculate that your mouth is doing constant algorithms and math equations essentially when you're fighting to weight distribution where we are, especially when you tie up with someone else and you have to feel their way and you have to manipulate it in a way to get it where you want, whether it's against the cage or whether it's on the ground, your body is using a equation. You know your mind is equating, how much force do I need to make this happen? How little forest? Like what if I go the opposite direction because they're pushing into me. There's all these different things that you have to over. There's no other way to do it. Then then a trial and error process and over and over and over and over again.

Speaker 3:          01:38:36       Yeah, and you look at someone who's like really good at one aspect of MMA, like Yoel Romero who is just a ridiculous wrestler, and you go, okay, look how much touch button the park. Is that guy doing cartwheels? Is he doing? Is he tumbling?

Speaker 6:          01:38:50       No, but I bet you he does 100 double eggs a day at least. Well, he's doing all kinds of legs and then 100 body locks. Then, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:39:00       connor lost. Everybody's like, this is what we need. We need a movement coach. I need to move in, coach, you know, and it still might. I mean as

Speaker 6:          01:39:07       George St Pierre, it has massive benefits to get that kind of coordination. Physical strength. Do you like about connor though? Is like um, his balance is impeccable and that could be part of that and like he is never over himself, at least with the striking part of it in the ground is a completely different thing. But when he's in striking range and it's just his body, his eye hand coordination is incredible. And his balance, like he's never too far over a punch. He's never too far back. He's always centered, he's always centered, he throws a kick, he never gets, you know, you see people kick and they miss and they kinda like stumbled like their weights off balance or, or they kick and even land and even when they put their foot down it's kind of like, it's not a good landing, you know, like I'm not like the world's best kicker, but when I watched conor do it, it's like he kicks or push kicks and sticks it. He is like a, like a, a gymnast in the sense, you know, the flip and then they want to just boom, stick it like. And he's really, really good at that sense. Maybe that's where the movement does benefit. I think. So then he never is over himself in his weight distribution but isn't the case

Speaker 3:          01:40:10       whenever someone loses though, everyone always second guess is what they were doing. Even if what they were doing was getting them to be like 16 and no, totally undefeated world champion. When you'd make a mistake or something goes wrong or something goes right for your opponent, we should probably say immediately people start questioning everything you did.

Speaker 6:          01:40:29       Yeah, definitely all the time. I mean it happened with me when, you know, when I lost to Toronto, that guy, you got to change this, you gotta change everything, but as long as you're winning people like, yeah, keep doing what you're doing and it's working, and then he loses it, like change everything. It's like, Jeez, that was quick.

Speaker 3:          01:40:45       Well, that's also the Rhonda criticism in the Holly Holm fight. Everybody was like looking at her like a dominating Betco. Heyo would stand up, you know, I'm beating

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       Sarah Mcmahon and the way she did Alexis Davis beating her down the way she did and go, we'll look. Rhonda obviously is getting so good at striking, so just such an elite athlete that she can do what she's doing to anybody and then her trainer saying that she could go box women professionals and knock them out and so you get this thing in your head that you can do what you have been doing and then you fight someone like holly and you go, Oh, well, okay. Yeah, there's a leather sole. There's so many levels. I mean, it's one of the more fascinating things about martial arts is that there are so many levels.

Speaker 2:          01:41:26       Yeah. And there's never. It's never ending. Never ending story really is, right? Yeah. Is this a song that I ever just goes on? Yeah. Um, no, it's, it's literally, it's you never injected when you think you have it all figured out. Boom. There goes the curve ball. I think that's what's addicting about this sport though. Like it's safe to say it's like a drug. It's, it's addicting. I think adversity in some weird way. I'm definitely addicted to that. I like it when things seem insurmountable or their look too hard or other people don't believe that I can do it.

Speaker 4:          01:42:03       That's such a weird quality because most people have the opposite. Most people are like, I like it when I know I can take a nap. I liked it. I like it when that couch looks soft and I'm gonna walk over there and plop myself down. I'll let you know. And you're like, I'm going to run up that fucking mountain with no air. See how I see how long I could go before I pass out. Weird quality.

Speaker 2:          01:42:23       Yeah. Um, I don't know. It is weird, but I like it. I Dunno like that about myself because I know anytime I ever get into a hard situation about, about anything, it's like I can get through it. I've, I've seen worse, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:42:36       Well you definitely have proven that. There's no doubt about it. You know, and you've proven it inside the octagon just leading up to this fight. Obviously he proved it in this fight, but you proved it leading up to this fight. Like the Sara Mcmann fight I think was one of your most impressive fights because you got her down and you were me and she's a fucking silver medalist in the Olympics and you were dominating the top position. You out scrambled or you stayed on top of her and beat her down and I was like, that is it does it. Big victory. Heavy top game. You do. We should grapple sometime. Okay. Well I'm scared now. Girls say we should grapple sometimes. Yeah. But always gets odd. Weird, quick. No, I'm sure you do. I'm sure, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:43:16       but um, it comes to wrestling and I think just experience and knowing, you know, wrestling can translate. A lot of sports can translate well into two mix. Marsha, I happen to think wrestling is one of the best translations, you know, as opposed to like someone typically boxers coming into the sport don't typically transition as well. Kickboxers, you know, because they have so much more to learn. I feel like the fundamentals of wrestling kind of the, they, they encompass a lot of what you need in mma and if you are the better wrestler you can decide do I want to stay on the feeder? I want to take it to the ground. It dictates what dictates. So with that said, um,

Speaker 6:          01:43:51       I think I learned how to use the pieces that work for wrestling and MMA and take out the ones that don't because there's a lot of stuff in the wrestling or any other sport that you're going to bring over the doesn't work from because I'm amazed the sport of its own. And I think maybe like Mcmahon Ha, like she's such an elite level wrestler that she's so ingrained with just wrestle, wrestle, wrestle, wrestle that it's hard sometimes with the more elite you are at something to like water it down again, essentially. That's kind of what you have to do that you have to take pieces out for mixed martial arts. There's some things that you don't want to do because Oh, you got choked. If you do that, you know, like when you're in wrestling, the last thing you want to do is be on your back. So you turn over you and you arch out, you lift your neck. It's like, Oh man, if you try to do that, you try to stand up the way that you wouldn't. A wrestling match, you're going to get choked, can't do that. You've got to keep your Chin tucked and then you've got to hand fight. So there's things that you have to relearn. And I think when you're such an elite elitist at something, sometimes it's hard to relearn those.

Speaker 4:          01:44:47       That's very good point. And I think you could also use that same point where you're talking about strikers learning takedown defense and that like a lot of strikers like to stand up really straight and you know, as soon as they get involved in exchanges with people, they fall into their old striking ways. And that's when a got like George St Pierre who was so good at being unpredictable. Like you never knew if he was going to take you down if he's going to stand for

Speaker 6:          01:45:08       one of the most flawless fighters. When you say as far as like a game by sticking a game plan and being disciplined and we're getting emotional. Never getting away from the game plan.

Speaker 4:          01:45:16       Well in his prime, you look at during his run and no one keeps her run up forever. But during his run, I mean he beat everybody. They put in front of him and he fought in some incredible fights where he fought some really, really dangerous difficult guys and manage his way through the water to victory. And that's all you could ever expect from a champion. And people will say like, oh well here's some of the sites were boring, or he played safety first. Like Jesus Christ, he fought the killers of the killers and he had five rounds and in during those five rounds, you know, Carlos Condit head kicks him and drops him. Matt Serra knocked him out and won the title. He's had adversity like, but he beat everybody. You can't ask for more. Like what do you think would happen if he just, there's this mentality that some fans want where they want a guy who wants a bite down his mouthpiece and just swing away and like come on seven and hope for the best. That's so retarded. Like that's not what martial arts are about.

Speaker 6:          01:46:13       Not One hundred percent people. People sometimes tend to enjoy the excitement of amateur fights more because they're more chaotic. Like people don't know what they're doing. So it's just like stick to two people in there that Kinda know how to throw punches and maybe Kinda know how to wrestle and they just go balls to the wall because that's like, that's all that they know that they're confident in. Just go as hard as you can.

Speaker 4:          01:46:33       It's also like a really good debate between two very articulate and very intelligent people. No one is going to get the real upper hand real quick. There's gonna be points and counterpoints is going to go back and forth. Both guys going to be very well prepared. Both women are going to be very well prepared. You're not going to get like a very clear winner right away unless something crazy happens. Like Aldo in Mcgregor, like all those just so mad at Mcgregor from all this fucking shit talking he's been doing for months and months and months that he just runs at them and gets clipped crazy. For a guy like Aldo, that's gotta be maddening. You hold the title for nine fucking years or however long you held it.

Speaker 2:          01:47:13       I think it was in second. Oh my God. I mean any scene, although do that. He was so emotionally charged. Yeah. He was very upset and that just goes to show how much the mind is a powerful thing. It's like if you. If if you, if you think you can or think you can't, you're right. Either way, it's, it's really derived from your, your mind, you know, and, and you can have all the skills in the world if you don't believe you can do it or, or whatever. You don't have the confidence in your mind, you won't just interesting. Or if someone puts a seed in there and like, like, like connor, I just think that he was so good at the mental warfare and you know, Josie never had to deal with that. Never. That was the thing. It was like

Speaker 4:          01:47:51       he was all respect. Everyone that he fought, shook his hand, respected him. I realized he's this killer. I mean, and he was the reigning featherweight champion for as long as there was a featherweight champion. He was the first, the original. He held that title for longer than anybody and was flawless. I mean he had some amazing fights, but he started this show, like some chinks in his armor or towards the end, like the second fight that he had with Chad Mendez. Like it's shit like that was a real war and real grueling fight. Whereas, you know, the first fight with Mendez, he just looks insane. It looked tremendous and stop Mendez quick,

Speaker 2:          01:48:26       so I think nobody rides for free. They train so hard in Brazil to. They're insane. No doubt God no. And yellow in particular. Yeah, they go to war. There's a good saying about training. I'm smarter and not harder sometimes are working, you know, usually it's working, but same thing goes for training. Overtraining is a big thing in this.

Speaker 4:          01:48:47       Yeah. I'm glad you brought that up because I wanted to talk to you about that because you had mentioned that in the hallway fight he had made sure, you know, we were training for a five round fight in particular. How do you make sure that you are in peak performance level but you're not overtraining? Like who? Who Designs your program?

Speaker 2:          01:49:03       Well, you know, I think a lot of it depends on athlete input. Does someone can design a program, but if you show up one day and you're supposed to be pushing sleds, you know, or do something heavy and hard and you're like, I'm exhausted. Then they're like, okay, we need to dial back your feedback. Your heart rate. Yeah. Yeah. I wear like a polar heart rate monitor, I take it in the morning when you wake up and all the HRV and see where I'm at. And that's really helpful. The heart rate variable. Okay. So basically it tells you how, how your heart is recovering. So when you first wake up in the morning, um, from my understanding, the more like the more that your heart is kind of like irregular, maybe for a better sense of terms means that it's responding to things like quickly if it's kind of sluggish and it's Kinda like not really, not really reading that kind of quick reaction, then it's not, then you're tired, your body is still broken down. It's not recovered though, you're, you're kind of looking for that irregular kind of Bouncy, you know, I don't know if it's a rhythm, but there's something that the, the hrv reads, not just the heart rate but something about the heart in it and it reads it. The heart rate variable and I'm tells you whether you're actually recovered or not.

Speaker 4:          01:50:11       And who goes over this stuff with you? Do you have a?

Speaker 2:          01:50:14       Um, no, not really. My sports doctor, I'll go over it with him. You know, you're basically calling the shots. Yeah, and it's, it's really easy to read. It's either green, orange or red, like if you're in the red, don't kill yourself that day. Like it tells you it's, it's, you know, it's very simple. Anyone can do it. A wake up in the morning and if your heart rate variables in the red, that means like there should be a relatively easy day either a rest day or relatively easy and maybe should go for a nice run, like just let your body recover because if you don't realize you don't get stronger while you're training, you don't get stronger while you're lifting weights, you're actually damaging your body. You're actually going backwards. You get stronger when you're resting, recovering from the work. And that's what, that's. That's literally what it is, is when you're resting, after you've worked out hard and after you tore everything apart.

Speaker 2:          01:51:04       I mean if you work out 24 slash seven, there's no chance to repair and heal and grow and get stronger. So you know, it, it just goes back to that, that science and that balance of when to push hard and when to, when to not push hard. And I think that our sport typically has a lot of really tough people who don't like to ever think, you know, they're just in that work hard mentality because we're fighters. We're like the toughest people, but a lot of times they don't stop and think like, it doesn't matter how tough you are. Like science is science buddy, you know, it's, it's, it doesn't matter. You're going, I'm just going to work out harder. I'm going to push through it. I'm gonna spar hard today even though I feel like crap. Like, I mean there's something we said maybe for mental toughness, I guess, you know, you're going to go in there and you're going to push through it. There's times for that. But, um, I don't question my mental toughness. So I just listen to my body. You know, I don't, I'm not at a point in my career where I have anything to prove as far as like how tough I am. Skins and Misha, my coaches always tell me like, we're not, we don't need to approve how tough you are. Me Should we already know that? So let's just, uh, if you don't feel like sparring today was tomorrow. Well that's one of the things

Speaker 4:          01:52:06       that I think really does trip up a lot of fighters is that they're so tough and they figure out how to push through injuries to figure out how to force themselves through situations, but then they get these, these damage to their joints are damaged to their back or. And a lot of it comes from not recognize the difference between an actual injury and pain. Just a little bit of discomfort and pain is normal. It's constant. It's never going to go away. Everybody who does martial arts experiences that, but for someone like Cain Velasquez, it almost becomes like a detriment because he's such a fucking gorilla and he just knows how to push through everything that he blows everything out. He blows his shoulder out and then he blows the other shoulder around. He his knees out. It blows back out. I mean, he's, in my opinion, when he was at his best, he's the greatest of all time is between him and fader.

Speaker 4:          01:52:57       Those are the two possible heavyweights and the fate or one always has to have an asterick because he was fighting in pride and it was, you know, the steroid era, you could do whatever the fuck you want. Not saying even that he was on it, but who the fuck knows, but that, I don't think the guys that he fought, even though he looked amazing against them, I don't think Hong Man Choi is at the same level as like junior dos Santos when junior dos Santos was at his best when, when cain fought them. It's so hard to. And I think even junior dos Santos was overtrained for one of their fights and you know, they talked about it like they had measured his, um, his, um, creatine levels in his blood and he was, he was, he just hadn't recovered correctly.

Speaker 2:          01:53:41       Yep. That, that's so common. It's a big part of it. It's very being so tough because you see people go in, whether it's a three round fight or a five round fight, sometimes you'll see people gas out like a round and a half around it and you're like, oh, they must not a train hard. No, it's probably the. They trained too hard. Yeah, that's probably what it is. They're probably still beat up sometimes. Like I will go like fight week and I'll be in the workout, you know the mat room that they have in the hotel and sometimes I'll see these guys in there and they're just going. I mean they are going, they're hitting mitts. They're just ripping the big take downs and they're just blowing it all out. I'm just like thinking, dude, it's fight week calmed down and the hard work should have already all been done. Like this week is about recovery and usually it's like people not like foreigners that are still in that mindset of like know they're a little bit more old school mentality. I feel like some of those gyms still haven't caught up to the. The idea that it's not always about how hard you go.

Speaker 4:          01:54:39       Well, Matt Hughes told me that he used to train hard up until the day of the fight. They just trained hard and he's like always trained hard and you know,

Speaker 2:          01:54:48       yeah, fucking work though. Worked for him. Well, you know, but he was, you know, he was a high level athlete for a long time and he knew how to, how to harness what and you know, it's not saying that it can't, that it can't work, but I still think that there's something to be said about preserving the longevity of your career. You might not be able to do that as long you know.

Speaker 4:          01:55:10       Well, with a guy like Matt Hughes, it's so hard to, to say that now because he was such a pioneer. I mean he was at the early, early days of the UFC and it was one of the great champions and one of the greatest champions ever. And when you look at his title run and his reign of 170 pound division, like during his heyday, he had to say like this guy, like he's sort of paved the way and a lot of ways, especially for a wrestler that developed some really good submission skills. I mean he's got some excellent submission victories, including that arm bar that he submitted George St Pierre with mean he had some really good submission skills for a wrestler. Yeah, he's incredible. Is that it was time a little bit, you know, definitely ahead of his time. And you know, an an important pioneer. If you look at the overall game like these, there's these moments where a person emerges and they go, okay, we haven't seen one of those guys before.

Speaker 4:          01:56:04       Like Yoyo Rodriguez is a perfect example. Like this fucking guy. I watched that guy fight and I go, Jesus Christ, like here's a new thing. Here's a guy who's like this elite taekwondo guy who knows how to do everything else too. But he throws these taekwondo kicks, like a normal person throws a jab. He just, they're a part of his arsenal. He's throwing, jumping, roundhouse kicks and we'll kicks and he's, he's doing shit that like, you gotta you gotta get ready for this because this guy's going to do this every round and this is a totally different type of engaging a. you've got to be aware of things coming from all these crazy angles and they're coming fast. These wheeled kicks and the jumping roundhouse kick did hit a feely with like, Holy Shit. That was crazy. Fucking crazy. And he's, he's one of these new guys. It's like he's got so much skill.

Speaker 6:          01:56:51       We used to train with philly. Did you? Sacramento were a part of the team Alpha male and it was funny like he, he's come such a long way like he, he used to have for some reason he had like a house arrest thing on his ankle, like the bad things, you know, train with it on. He had to trim it that. But he did not want to train. So I guess he got permission to go to the gym and I don't know what it was, you know, what it was for. But it's a funny story because it's like, I just remember him back then and he was just still like, you know, it was still relatively new to the game and now you know, he's doing well and then obviously his last loss.

Speaker 4:          01:57:24       Well he zigged and zagged and that's just what happens in the game. Yeah. He got caught and he also fought a guy who was one of the elite of the elite right now at 1:45. He's unpredictable. So wild. Yeah. He and his fucking ground game is really good to hear. Can do everything. Yeah. Okay. Something mad he is signed. I knew he was something but feeling something to. He's a tough fucking kid and I thought that was going to be a great fight like this. I'm really interested to see how feeling navigates the kicks because that's the big thing. Is he going to try to kick with this guy? Is he going to try to like. Maybe I'm just like, bear down like did you, do you watch Gloria at all? A little bit. Did you see Raymond Daniels and Joseph Valvoline? Valvoline. He is a traditional Moy Thai style fighter and he just just kept his hands up high and just chop the legs and chopped them down and eventually knocked them out with a head kick, but Raymond Daniels is this wild motherfucker, throws, jumping, spinning, threesixty, turning sidekicks to your face and all this wild shit.

Speaker 4:          01:58:25       And he was a point karate champion who eventually got into kickboxing and he's so wild with his kicks. Just he hit this guy with a touch front leg side kick and then spun in the air and hit them with a spinning back kick to the face where people like that who can recreate that style to get someone like him. You'd have to get a karate or that. It's like it's all you can get, you know? Well, it's people that don't understand that there's, there's some skills that these traditional martial artists have like a traditional, like a lot of karate guys and a lot of talk window guys in particular. There's some things that they can do with their legs. The average person just can't do. And if that karate guy or that taekwondo guy like a year Rodriguez, learns wrestling, learns Jujitsu, and learns kickboxing, and has all that shit at a really elite black belt level, you're fucked.

Speaker 4:          01:59:18       Someone a good friend of yours. It can do weird things with his legs. Eddie Bravo. Oh yeah. Lowered guy is like, he's like gumby. Well he's been stretching his legs like that. Like, like religiously for Jack. He not that flexible like growing up now. He just keeps doing it. Did Eddie, when you watch TV with Eddie, Eddie will never wear shoes. He doesn't wear shoes. Just puts his fucking feet everywhere and it kind of freaks people out. But Eddie will sit there and he'll just like be like stretching himself up. So He'd be sitting watching TV and he'll be ready to get to, but he'll be like sitting there and it'll hold it and he can do that without like pulling on it. Like he doesn't have to have arms that pull his legs in these positions so he could just tuck his legs in the places and all of a sudden you're like locked up in a Gogo plot. And you don't even know how the fuck he got his leg there. I know I grappled with him once years ago. He was like retarded. Really tricky. But he's like, dude, you're like grappling with the dude. Is that feel good or that.

Speaker 2:          02:00:21       Yeah, that's always a compliment. As long as people don't say, I look like a dude, I can grapple. I could do it all day long. And that's never, you know, never an issue. I dread the day when like I love it when people were like, oh, you don't look like a fighter. I'm like, good, that's good. Because like, it really dread the day when people like, man, you look like a fighter. Like, oh whoops. Went too far. I, I pushed the edge of the envelope and I didn't come out on the winning side. The grapple like a dude is isn't okay. Like, yeah, you make out like a dude that's not yet. How do you know?

Speaker 4:          02:00:53       Is this conversation going back? Well, there is a definite difference between watching some women grapple and what some women can do it in. This got to be some benefits to like being a woman when it comes to grappling.

Speaker 2:          02:01:09       There is sometimes like, yeah, oh, rappel some guys and I don't realize it's much different to be like, man, you are so flexible or like you've got, you know, your ankles. Like I try to log and it was like most guys would attack, but he was like, you were fine. I was like, I, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          02:01:22       Have you ever seen this thing that ballerinas used? And this is a, I think it's a new device, but it's like you slide your foot into like this. It seems like a rubber sheath has like this, a flat board and they just like this rubber sheath and you slide your foot into and that do these exercises

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       with your foot. And somebody put it up on one of the Jujitsu pages that I follow on instagram. And they were like, this is the best way to prevent foot locks. Like literally it just strengthens it, strengthens it, and stretches it to the point where if somebody gets you into like a, um, a footlocker and they're pushing down like a toehold in there as they're pushing down on your foot, it's the hyper extending of the ankle if it gets you to tap because you're like, oh, I think someone's going to tear and the people tap and this gets your foot into this flexible position where you've kind of strengthen and make it so flexible that you can't get tapped in certain ways. You never tried. You haven't Jamie's odors. Huh? That looks similar. That's similar as pro arch. Is that what's it's called? That looks like it's making it like where your feet are like.

Speaker 3:          02:02:28       So yeah, like the arch of the Ballerina foot. That's probably like strengthening. Huh? To be able to stand on that. What does that. You weren't. Birkenstocks is brutal. The feet feet are so nasty, so bad. It's like, Oh, I thought my feet were bad news girl who is a ballerina, and she had to have her feet fixed because her, her toes, she had smashed her toes for so long, like doing like point and trying to stand on their toes that she had to get, like she had these scars over the top of her feet where she had to get her toes, like realigned and deter ligaments repaired. Valets, a hard hard support from, from my understanding, like I don't think they get enough credit. They also have to starve themselves. You have to be one. Did you see that swan movie? Was it black?

Speaker 2:          02:03:16       Yeah, freaky. It was insane. Oh yeah. It's not a woman's empowering sort of activity. Yeah. I posted a picture of me with a scale of the day, like weighing myself. People like 1:47, they're like freaking out about it or whatever. I'm like, yeah, wait, you know, almost 150 pounds. But they're like, I feel like that's good that not, you know, it goes to show you don't have to be a hundred pounds or 110 pounds to look good or be beautiful or whatever. And I'm like, yeah, I don't, I'm not ashamed of what I way at all, like at all at all. I don't care. I get weigh a hundred 60 pounds as long as I look good and feel good. Like, you know, people were just kind of surprised that I guess women have numbers in their head that you don't want to go over.

Speaker 3:          02:03:58       Yeah. Thirty five is like the peak. Don't get bigger than this.

Speaker 2:          02:04:02       Yeah, I think it used to be like 1:10. My mom's best friend growing up, she was um, she was Vietnamese and they had, they had a rule where she's having to me, so the Vietnamese side of her family, so she was a little bit bigger bone. Gorgeous, beautiful. Like exotic green eyes, dark black hair like halfway to me is really, really pretty. And um, her family was so hard on her because she weighed over a hundred pounds, like you were supposed to be under. You're supposed to be 99 or less because they're all super tiny, but she was half, so her aunt, she got her half of her White Dad's side and she was like on nine or something

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       and was like, Yo, you lose weight, Lynn. Lynn, you lose weight. You too heavy. Too heavy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. And she had just, she got eating disorders and stuff like that. And like later, because she was so just mortified that she weighed more, you know, they didn't want her to weigh over 100. Oh, that's so crazy. The number crazy number on things. Numbers. Yeah. It doesn't matter to me. How do you look if you look good, what does it, what difference does it make? Like obviously being a fighter, you're going to be denser. I mean, how anybody wouldn't understand that a woman like you, what do you like? Five, seven, five, six, five, six, five, six, 145 pounds. You're going to have a ton of muscle. I mean, you have to, if you're doing all the grappling, you're doing what kind of strength and conditioning program and you on,

Speaker 6:          02:05:24       um, I go usually like two, three days a week and I go to this place called phase one sports and they work with a lot of athletes that were the boxers and football players and things like that. So I do like the most that I really do for like actual lifting weights is probably power cleans or like hang cleans. I go, you know, flip the bar that's I think really good explosive movement for um, like for wrestling and things like that. Um, I do sled pushing and do a lot of body weight stuff, a lot of footwork and you know, um, we kind of mix cardio and weight so we'll do like, he'll like do one set of the workout that's strength based. So it's like anaerobic. And then we'll run sprints. So kind of like to simulate a fight. Like you're going through a, a combination and it's anaerobic, you throwing five, six punches and you're doing that without oxygen.

Speaker 6:          02:06:09       Anaerobic. And then you do something where, you know, you circle away and you move or something that's a robotic, you know, are you coming for the take down? That's kind of an anaerobic movement. And then so it simulates the fight. So we do a lot of, um, I don't know, it's not really anything super rocket science, I don't think. But I like it. It works for me. She's done a strength and conditioning program. I love strength and conditioning and I'm in high school and stuff. I lifted a lot of weights. I get criticized a lot actually in high school because I was pretty buff in high school and I wrestled and criticized when girls or boys actually guys mostly I think the girls were kind of scared of me even though I was never confrontational. I never really fought people. It was like pretty nice everyone. But I'm like, I don't know, the girls are probably like, if they knew, if they would mess with me, I probably would have wrecked them. You know what? I was just kinda like passive. I was a people watcher and uh, yeah, like the guys were like, man, stop lifting. MEESHA getting to buff. Like maybe you need to lift more.

Speaker 5:          02:07:08       Were you wrestling in high school? I wrestled in high school. What was that like? That was hard, man. It was actually the first half of my season was terrible. But you wrestling dudes. Are you wrestling girls? Primarily guys. That's ridiculous. I was the only consistent female on my team for four years. What the fuck motivated you to go do that? I'm just like wrestling dudes. Yeah. No, actually that was that. Like I said, it was terrible. Like my first day. My Gosh. Well I'll get to why I did it. I did it because I can't play basketball.

Speaker 5:          02:07:43       That was really the reason why I didn't do it. Did you want to play basketball? No, I hate basketball. Well that's probably why he can't play basketball because I bet if you wanted to play basketball you figured out how to get really good at basketball. So don't, don't say you can't play basketball. It would have been a long road man. I couldn't it ever tell you. It's taken a long time as if MMA isn't a long road, but it's way more fun. What does it mean crazy though, that the odds of you getting famous as a female basketball player or nonexistent? Yeah, there was like, I mean the NBA still exists, right? Name one famous NBA player named one. Go ahead. Ready Go. You can't do it. But female fighters at the time, it was ridiculous. If you're in high school and said one day I'm going to be a female cage fighter.

Speaker 5:          02:08:27       People like it was crazy bitch. Get away from her. She never fucking mind. Meanwhile you're famous. He was just barely coming out. I was like, so I know it's crazy. Um, so I decided to do it out of default because I want to do, to do a sport, but I was really reluctant to play basketball or even try. Didn't like, it just didn't appeal to me. You didn't click can't dribble the ball. He did. I don't shoot well, like I didn't pee a couple times. I'm like, this is not the sport for me. I can't jump very high. Like everything is just like not I'm not made to play basketball. And so I went out for wrestling and I was like, yeah, I guess I'll try this. And uh, we didn't tell my dad at first either because he would have probably been mortified. He was mortified when we told him, but it was too late by then already I was already in.

Speaker 5:          02:09:13       It was, I think my mom thought I was going to quit. So she tried to hide it from him for like two, three weeks or so, like thinking, oh, she's probably going like this, but I love the girls were on the team with you. One other girl that was my best friend, Sharon, and it was actually her idea. I never probably would have thought of it. We were an honors English class, will smarty pants and she looks at me and she's like, you know, everything, you want to do a sport but I don't want to play basketball either. You want to go out for wrestling. I like wrestling and I always taught wrestling was so weird. Like in middle school as a kid I'm like, what are they doing? Like these boys in these tight suits like rolling around. This is a weird um, so I had this like distaste for wrestling, but it's kind of like, well, it's better than basketball probably.

Speaker 5:          02:09:57       Yeah, sure. Let's try it. Yeah, that's how. I mean it's nothing against the basketball, but I just, I just can't. I don't know. How did you know that you liked it? Wrestling? Yeah. Well the first day I got my ass kicked bad. Like I left with like Matt Burns all over my body and my face, like I didn't know what I was doing. They tried to get me to quit. They didn't want the girl, they did not want us there. And so they meaning the teammates, teammates and the coaches. Really? Yeah, the coach. Yeah. The coach was kind of an ass, like he was only there for one year. He actually ended up getting, he had of getting fired. But anyways, um, yeah, they did not want us there. So I think they thought like, if we make this as

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       hard on them as possible, they'll just quit because that's like, you know, I think they had a couple years before, like a girl come out and like they didn't, they never lost, like they never made it past the two weeks. So I think I kind of felt that and I was like, you just wait for us. I was like, I'm going to prove you wrong. I'm going to stick around, I'm going to do this. And I was like, and as sure as hell no, I can't get any worse. It was like, so the law of diminishing returns says I'm bound to get better. And um, yeah, I kept coming back every day and it was the hardest thing that I've ever done. I think that's why I liked it so much. It was fucking hard, really, really hard. And they did a lot of conditioning, a lot of, you know, but I loved, I didn't mind that at all.

Speaker 2:          02:11:12       Like I love that stuff. I love working, I love conditioning, I love pushing myself. The part that was the most challenging was the actual wrestling because they didn't want to teach us anything. They didn't teach me anything. I remember they put me in there with a guy who placed third in state and he just wrecked me. I was like, can you at least show me a double ad? I was like, I don't know anything. I don't know how to do any of this stuff. Like, can you show me? They're like, just a body. Yeah. They're like, no, just go wrestle and you just embarrassed me. What a Shitty fucking wrestling coach. Yeah. Well, I don't know. They didn't want us there. Was that the first time that you knew about yourself though, that you liked to overcome adversity like that, that you could do liked difficult challenges?

Speaker 2:          02:11:48       Looking back on it? I think so because I didn't realize how tough I was until I got through like a wrestling season. I'm like, holy crap. That was really hard. Brutal for people who've never done anything difficult to is probably like the first. Most people don't say when you start out with a big team and half the people drop like flies really quickly, a couple of kind of dwindle out and you're left with like a few that are really there to do it. And especially with me being so terrible, like I lost. Um, I mean I probably lost about every match that you're, I'd never wrestled before and I was competing against guys. Um, I can't remember exactly. Uh, I think I'd be a girl like later in the season, my first year and I lost my very first wrestling match was actually against another female, which was rare and it lost by points, but she was like a senior, so it was whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:12:38       I just tried to know. I got pinned. That's a lie. I remember I got Penn, she was a senior, it was like second round and I didn't, I just didn't know very much, you know. And uh, then I went on it. Actually my senior year I ended up wrestling varsity. Whoa. Yeah, that's crazy. So you went through freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior year. Yeah. All four years. Four years. You wrestled? Yeah. That's amazing. I loved it. Won't go live for it. That's crazy. Yeah. And the senior year you were a varsity wrestler. What in the fuck what? Wait, this is the hilarious part. Okay. So. So I was good but I wasn't male varsity good. You know, I love wrestling. I worked hard. I came early, I stayed late, I did all that. But um, I wasn't that level right. But, but the thing was is that we didn't have 152 pounder.

Speaker 2:          02:13:29       We had to one $45. So I wrestled 1:45. I didn't know how to cut weight so it's just what I was walking at at the time. I was heavier and heavier in high school than I am now and I didn't know anything about diet. I didn't know anything about anything. I thought what I joe, this is how stupid I was. I thought that when I had to make wait the next day that I needed to eat the most low calorie foods, so I would go like get the jar of salsa which has had or I don't know how many thousands of milligrams of sodium, which is going to help you hold water. I didn't know. It's like, oh, it's five calories per serving, let me eat this whole thing. And then like, I'm sure it was like a balloon the next day. Like it's no wonder like I couldn't cut any way like nobody, nobody taught me anything about cutting wakes up to eat, throw garbage bag on and run around, you know.

Speaker 2:          02:14:16       And so anyways, um, there was two, 1:45 pounders, no 1:52 pounders. So what they would do is basically I was the sacrificial lamb. We would both weigh in at 1:45 for varsity and they would decide which opponent was more likely for the guy, our guy teammate to beat. And they would match him up so that we could get a win and they would put me with the tougher opponent. So that our guy that had a chance at winning could win because they were like the new. Either way I probably wasn't able to win and get. I mean these are, these are tough guys. Like I've been wrestling for years. They'd been wrestling their whole life. Right. And they're cutting weight. So half the time I'm wrestling 1:50, two pound men. Like I'm weighing in at 1:45 on Vr, on the Varsity team and just getting, you know. Oh my gosh. Did you beat any dudes? I did, but not in Varsity varsity guys. But I beat some other guys. I made him cry, I made a few guys quit. It would always get back to our school.

Speaker 2:          02:15:16       It would always get back to our school to like, Oh yeah, that guy you beat last week. He quit the team. Yeah. I would come back to our school because obviously there was a, you know, a rival school or whatever. But somehow it would get back to it. Yeah. Like I guess he quit the team. I wonder how much that. I don't know. I don't. I didn't care. Wound care. I didn't care, of course. I mean you can't. No, we're not gonna make it. Yeah. You gotta keep going one time. Do you know what a Saturday night right? Is? Sure. Yeah. Can you explain it to people? It's the most brilliant. So it's basically, I'll tell you a story. I got by like a hundred 50, two pounds state placer. I weighed in at 1:45. I remember he wrestled for White River and he went out and just bulldoze me right over and Saturday night ride pin me and like 18 seconds. I mean he crushed me but it's the most embarrassing and do like it's a last, like if you're a girl in high school, that's the last way that you want them to on. So basically they, they lay like straight on top of you in like a starfish position and they wrap your arm both of your arms with their arms and wrap your legs with your legs so that you can't, you're just starfish out on your back.

Speaker 6:          02:16:30       And like I was like, what an asshole. Like you know, he did it on purpose.

Speaker 1:          02:16:34       Well why does that? But if it was effective, why is that more embarrassing? Just because your legs are all spread out

Speaker 6:          02:16:39       and it looks like a sexual position kind of, you know, because they're like right on top of you. Stomach to stomach, chest to chest pain. The Groin. Here it is. Yeah. That, that's. Yeah, that's close. Well, that's amount. Someone mounting grape vining someone. Oh, it's not really pulling up the one go down again. The black and white one, right? Uh, yeah, there's, yeah, that's kind of like basically I'm sort of. But he's kind of doing more of an Armbar. So just imagine if you had thing amount with a double bond. So it's just kind of, you know what I mean? It was just like demoralizing. No, I get it, damn it. And it was so fast. But usually actually I didn't get pinned on Varsity so it was so flexible because back to that, like people couldn't turn me over. Even the varsity guys like I would.

Speaker 6:          02:17:26       That was my survival technique was like my shoulders were so flexible that if like in, in high school wrestling you can't go past was potentially dangerous. You're not allowed to like dislocate someone's shoulders, so it's like they would try to turn me on my shoulder, my arm, it be going, going, going, going, going, and they were like, you can't go past that or you're going to dislocate your arm, you know? So it was like, that was my, my Hail Mary. It was like I'm really flexible and I'm super tough and I would just, would not let. I would have let my arm dislocate for sure. I was not going to let him turn me. That's totally fine.

Speaker 1:          02:17:53       Interesting things about wrestling, isn't it? This is like there's some things that you would do in a fight that you're not allowed to do.

Speaker 6:          02:18:00       Well, it's collegiate wrestling, so it's um, there's different styles. There's collegiate, which is more safe for schools. Yeah. Because our kids. And then you get into freestyle wrestling, which you can throw people in slam and collegiate. You have to kind of set them down. You're not allowed to just like pick someone in the article, boom, throw them. You have to kind of put them down.

Speaker 1:          02:18:16       But even just freestyle. I remember when Mark Schultz fought in the Olympics and rip that guy's arm apart, got them into Kamora and sort of tossed them with the oranges. He yanked his arm backwards. Yeah, I mean he, he got disqualified for that. Which we're in the UFC would be an amazing move.

Speaker 6:          02:18:32       Yeah. Well I guess it's a different mindset. I guess they think of wrestling is wrestling and fighting is fighting. It's different.

Speaker 1:          02:18:39       It is, but it's like it's effective grappling like the use of your body against their body. It's interesting in that way. It's right.

Speaker 6:          02:18:47       Think for wrestling. I don't know if you're supposed to use like joint manipulation. I think maybe that's the difference. It's supposed to be like that. You can control their body with your weight on top of them. Not necessarily like contort their joint in the wrong direction so that you know, that's Jujitsu. Jujitsu comes in.

Speaker 1:          02:19:05       Do you remember when Matt Hughes Fought Ricardo Almeida and choked them out, but with like a front headlock? Yeah. Which is a move that is actually using a wrestling all the time. That was a fascinating.

Speaker 6:          02:19:18       Some wrestlers have adapted more of that stuff too, and then they put that in there more than one start putting some pressure on the throat and folding people over it and they try to get a little bit

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       who's so fucking strong when he gets a hold of you in that position and he's. Yeah, he's pushing against your. Your arm and it's pending against your neck and then he's squeezing your neck on the other side. He's choking you out. Let's just like a head and arm choke, but in a reverse position. Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah. I was amazed when I saw that fight that he did that, that he was able to choke out Ricardo Tomato who's a Jujitsu black belt, but Maura may since then that no one else has been able to do it. Have you wrestled? Did you refresh? I wrestled in high school. Wrestle in high school one year. Yeah. It's hard. The other ones, taekwondo, so it was both. Yeah. I just decided to tag window was easier. I liked that and I like kicking people. It was like the biggest things, isn't it? I was, well it was also that I had to do it at school, so it was like I had to stay at school, which I fucking hated and I was just a Zombie like after us, so sore. I remember like we used to do the sprints upstairs and shit and carry each other across the football field and I was so fucking sore. I just remember thinking like a bark

Speaker 6:          02:20:32       used to do like what they call the gut busters I think because it literally makes me want to vomit. I was doing both at the same time too. I was doing taekwondo and wrestling at the same time. I just had determined I wish I could've done more extra curricular like school activities besides just what was offered by the school. That was one thing is like we were so we struggled a lot financially growing up. We didn't grow up in a privileged household by any means and they couldn't afford. My parents couldn't afford to put me into gymnastics at a time, you know, but I'm glad because I think that for it, that's what I wanted to do. I actually wanted to do gymnastics instead of wrestling, but they're like, you know, we just, it's too, too much and, but I'm glad that I didn't come from super privileged because it just gives me a whole different perspective.

Speaker 6:          02:21:16       Sure. You appreciate what you've earned, I'm sure. When did you start striking? When did you do any sort of striking martial arts? Nineteen. I was 19. When did you start out with? Um, I think it was just kickboxing. Yeah, just normal, like learning to throw kicks and normal, you know, it was kickboxing for mma. I never did any, like, just straight anything. It was always about, it was always about mma and obviously I wrestled. So the goal was always to grab people and get them to the ground. Right. So yeah, I started with kickboxing, learning how to throw basic kicks, learning how to throw basic punches, but like, but before my first fight, I think I had like maybe four weeks of striking, which is like nothing. Nothing that's crazy. It was crazy. Well,

Speaker 3:          02:22:00       in those situations where I had a buddy of mine who was a Jujitsu black belt, really high level Jujitsu guy and he's taken an mma fight and we had a conversation about it before and uh, I was going, well, how much striking are you doing? And he's like once a week or get together and do this. I'm like, Holy Shit. I'm like, listen, do you know what you can do to guys on the ground? Well, someone can do that. Do you standing up and evolve? That guy has to do

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       is keep you from getting a hold of him and your Foxville like you have to. You have to be understanding that like there's a difference in the consequences as well because the consequences of being in there with like a dangerous striker or one wrong move and you get clipped with something and you wake up. It's just, it's such a different thing. But so many people that are really good at one thing, they think all I have to do is do my one thing and they won't be able to stop me.

Speaker 6:          02:22:53       Right? Well, I went into my first fight, kind of ignorance is bliss, to not, not thinking like, you know, if I can't do this because I just didn't know how devastating it could be to get like kneed in the face now up in Washington state, they don't allow amateurs like to throw a full on, nice the face. I don't know, they don't allow it like an amateur fighting I think in California and stuff like that to like now there's more regulations and they don't allow it just because a lot of times and amateurs are still learning and just such a brutal blow, right. The need of the face like we are. I mean that's a hard. There is no protection. It straight like kneebone and that's pretty brutal. Um, my first fight, oh my gosh, you know, I went out there, I wrestled her. I pretty much just all that's all that I knew.

Speaker 6:          02:23:35       I don't even think I threw a punch on the ground. Like, I took her down like the easiest I've ever take her down and I think I forgot that I could punch because I was just, that's all I knew is wrestling. So just wrestled her the whole time. And then the second round I came out and threw a once you went to and I try to grab a hold of her and she put me in a Thai clinch. So her and her husband own the, uh, like, uh, owned a Thai school up in Canada. So she was like really good striker, no wrestling or really much grappling a little bit and I didn't know what it was. I didn't even know what a Thai clinch was, as much less how to defend it. So she just starts kneeing my face off and the only thing I can think to do is shoot.

Speaker 6:          02:24:09       So I'm just shooting into knees, is it Bam, Bam, Bam. And they're like, one of them caught my nose is clean on, busted it flattened my nose. And um, that was in such shock. And she, you know, because is the first time I've been hit really, like you don't, you know, you don't take blows to the face in wrestling. So I'm just like, Whoa, what is going on here, what am I doing? And she kind of like pushes me down like because I'm so shooting, but I kinda like slump out of the, uh, you know, off of the legs a little bit. I'm a little bit stunned obviously. And she spins around and takes my bag. She tried to choke me and I just, I remember I had this epiphany moment. It was like the world stopped, you know, and she's still trying to like fight me and beat me up. But I remember she tried to choke me and I had my hands like this and it's such a vivid moment because how I got this star, this is how I started my career. It was my first fight ever. And I'm watching this pool of blood and there's a steady stream, like not even dripping, like it's just pouring out of my nose and this pool of blood is getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And she's still trying to choke me and punched me and I'm thinking like, this bitch,

Speaker 7:          02:25:23       that's

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       exactly what the hell. No. And I got pissed. I got pissed. I lost my temper and the fight. I started bucking her off and that's when the fight, it really came out of me because before that I was just, I was so wrestling. I was like, you know, competing. That's when the fighter came out. I got fucking pissed. I was pissed. Not only that, my nose was broken. Not only that I got hit, but that she had my back. That was like, that was what pissed me off. Like the rest was kind of like, Eh, you know, but I was the wrestler. Fuck you, like get off my back like you're the striker, you're not allowed to be there. So I like started bugging her and she fell down into the guard position and I stood up above her and I reached to the ceiling as high as I could and I just started raining down punches from the standing position.

Speaker 2:          02:26:11       And the lead is going everywhere. Like she soaked in it. I've got it all over me, I'm just bleeding like a stuck pig everywhere and I remember her face Kinda like wincing, like trying to weather the storm and that's the how the second round ended and then I went back to my corner and like I'm the head, the head coach was like, we can't let you go back out for the third round because your nose is just so like we don't know how bad it is. And I was super bummed because that was the turning point in the fight for me. That's when it actually became a fight and I was like I really wanted to go back out in the third round and just whip this girl's ass. So you lost the fight but you learned a lot about yourself? Yeah, the ton. And I had to go home.

Speaker 2:          02:26:51       That's bringing this back full circle. This is where my, my very chauvinistic grandpa at the time, but you know, was kind of sexy super old school. Like he was like, you know, women do this and men do that. Women don't do this. So you're not allowed to do that. And what are you doing? I had to come home. Oh my God, that was the most dreadful drive I ever had because my nose was literally like three times this size. I had no definition between my, the bridge of my nose and my cheekbones. Like it just went straight out. It was flat like a lion and then it just went straight up to my cheek bones. That's how bad it was. I mean it got broken bat and then over like the next night, like I could barely even open my eyes and I had two giant black raccoon eyes.

Speaker 2:          02:27:30       So it was like, there's no hiding it. Like you get to look your grandpa straight in the face and he's like, risk. I told you, you know, and you're just like, oh yeah, oh man. He was just like that, you know, he just wouldn't like would not lay off of it was, this is why you shouldn't be doing this. This is absurd. This is ridiculous. This is embarrassing. And my dad's just like, you know, he's so embarrassed. Like he was just. Yeah, he was embarrassed. And I'm in the back of my mind, I know that I can't say anything at the moment, but in the back of my mind I was thinking, I'm not done. I've got to do this again. Like in the back of my mind I was thinking because everyone was like, well good. She good thing she got that out of her system. Like she'll, she'll surely never do that again. Thank God she got this. She learned her lesson early and I was thinking, I was like, I can't, I've got

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       to get back in. They're going to prove that I can do better than that was like, it was too embarrassing. I'd have to face every one that was telling me like I shouldn't be doing that. And you know what everyone says to you like before you like, but at least back then everyone would say to me, don't break your nose.

Speaker 6:          02:28:40       That was like my pre, like good luck, you know, like people say like, oh, go kill it. That meaning break a leg, you know, people like the other way, like, well, you know, good luck in your fight. Don't break your nose. Fuck, no, you know, it was so embarrassing. I think I missed like a week of call, a week of classes too because I had done it over like a break so I had like, I dunno it, like winter break or something and then I, I missed like a week because it was still so bad. Did you have to get it fixed? No, I probably should have. It's still not fixed, but you can feel it. It's like you can fill the disassociated. My septum is like,

Speaker 3:          02:29:20       it's not very well to be honest about the right side. Like I can barely. And this is a good day. Have you ever had thought about having it fixed? Yeah, I have, I have, but um, yeah, hopefully one of these days I just did it recently. Helped him a lot. Yeah. Yeah, I did it. I didn't do it till I was 39 my whole life. I had a fucked up now. Oh, that's amazing. Sound really nasally now to listen to myself. Like I'll probably go back and listen to podcasts. Like God, I sound nasally. I used to be just like you. I'll be like, one side was like three quarters closed. The other side was totally useless. I had no breathing out of my nose. It was just all fucked up in there. But now it's like, yeah, and then. But yeah. That's nice. I'm jealous.

Speaker 3:          02:30:05       Wait a rabbit and Joe, but you could get it fixed. Yeah. But then I was wondering like, don't they have to like shave it down? They're like, no, it's inside. Straighten it. It's like open up the like they opened it up but then it makes it a little bit weaker or something to get broken again. No, I don't think so. You know, I think we'll, they shaved down the turbinates. The inside, like there's these bumps inside your nose that hinders the opening or the opening smaller. They shaved that down, they cut out the inside. That's all calcified too for me, which is like cauliflower, cauliflower ear. You get that in your nose as well. I feel like I'm asking for it to get broken again though. As soon as I fix it. Like it says like it's gonna get broken again probably anyway. Right. If you keep fighting, but I think that like at least you have more of an opportunity to breathe and your cardio will definitely improve.

Speaker 3:          02:30:54       That's what they have heard about cardio already. If you breathe out of your nose, I'm sure it would help you in a lot of ways. I have to look into it. Yeah, I mean, so like when I was a kid, um, I went to a doctor like when I was 19 or 20 and I had a real problem with it and the doctor said, look, unless you stop fighting, you need to just deal with this and then once you're done competing then do it. And I just left it alone but that snore really bad and I want to take yoga class. I couldn't breathe out of my nose and finally I just bit the bullet. But after I did it, I made a youtube video about it because I'm like, oh my God, all these people saying that. It was like really bad. Like fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:31:32       It's nothing, it's nothing. The iteration was nothing. What did they like to do? Put you under? Yeah, but when it's over, like everybody's like, oh my God, it's so awful. You're miserable. Break your nose. They definitely get in there. They like break it and reset it though. Anything. Now it's broken up here like you could feel like it's all. Where was. I broke it when I was five was the first time I broke it. I broke it. Who knows how many times after that, but the inside was where it was all fucked up. It was just. And he said it was one of the worst you've ever seen. He's like, boy, this thing has been broken a lot. Said I don't know how many times you broke and I'm like, I don't know either, but I mean a. compare my nose though to like vandelay.

Speaker 3:          02:32:12       You remember when Vandelay vandelays one of those guys where if you look at vandelays first fight everything. Yep. So he had to get his. He does Nick Diaz, Nick Diaz, bone shaved down and he had scar tissue removed. But with Vandelay, he probably had that done too, but he had a bunch of scar tissue removed because he had so much scar tissue that his eyes were drooping like severely and his nose was flat. I mean just flatten. There was nothing left. So he had a piece of cartilage removed from his rib and then they redid his nose and he had his nose made big so that he could breathe out of it better. Like he like had the license while he was still fighting. Oh yeah. Do you remember when he fought in the UFC? He looked one way. I fought chuck and then like he, he looked like a completely different person.

Speaker 3:          02:33:00       I didn't even notice the nose because I was so focused on like the bone structure. Like I feel like that maybe he had a lot done. Yeah, he's crazy too. I've traded as Jim before madman. He's like, all all Alec tries to kill people. Yeah. No, he finds there. There's no sparring with vandelay fighting. Yeah. I've talked to people that spar with them and they were like, what in the fuck? He just kills people. Like no mercy. Like give me mark mark, that's just. Well that was like more of a Russian accent. That's not what he sounds like it, but it was like mean like that. I'm here to fight and there we go.

Speaker 3:          02:33:40       Just making really mean until like, like he's chewing through his training partners. That's what it was like. That guy got fucked over. He really did. I was so upset with when they tried to give him a lifetime ban and you know what, what they did was really wrong and sent him on his tail tailspin. Then he sent a bunch of crazy shit about the UFC and it's like that. The whole thing made me really sad because they were trying to make an example out of him. But look, that guy never failed a drug test. I don't know who the fuck knows what he was doing. He definitely did some shit, especially in pride for 100 percent. I mean when he fought cro cop, he was 218 pounds, you know, that's not from creatine. He did some shit 100 percent right,

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       but back then you were allowed to do whatever you want in the UFC. He never pissed hot. He never got caught. So to have this one time where he ran away from a drug test and to say that he's banned for life, so ridiculous. It was just a total abuse of power and a really callous abuse by these people that are a part of the commission because they are responsible for this guy's livelihood and they just decided to treat him as an example and not respect him as a pioneer of the sport. What my thought is you should treat him as if he pissed hot. Look you randomly from a test, guess what? You're automatically pits and hot. So it would be like nine months and instead they said life. And I'm like, that is crazy. You can't take away a man's livelihood. No. He would've been better if he.

Speaker 4:          02:35:05       Yeah, like if he would've pissed hot technically yes, but much better. Yeah, much better. If you had been back fighting already, he'd be already scheduled right now in the UFC. He probably be still in the UFC and still fighting and now I guess he's going to fight for Bella tour and he's got a fight overseas because they reduced to suspension to like, I think they gave him a couple of years or something like that or maybe even less, but the time, a fight career that I can, especially when you're 38 as it is, we want to see 38. He's got to be right. Thirty seven, 38. It's um, it's so weird too because the trt thing, which was around for quite a few years and you saw the rejuvenation of Vituro and Dan Henderson, these guys that were on trt, that all of a sudden started doing really well again and just, it's such a gray area like.

Speaker 4:          02:35:55       And then that's, that gets removed and then like a, everybody's got to go back to your normal hormone secretion. Like, oh, what do you, how do you feel about the band? I don't like it. Yeah, I don't. Well, I don't like weigh ins. This is, this is what I feel like. I feel like we have to move away from this weight cutting thing because there's a difference between this sport in any sport other than boxing and I think that the head trauma aspect of it makes wayans 24 hours a day. Extremely problematic. When we understand the science of rehydrating, the brain can take as much as 70 plus hours, so that to me says that we're doing a bad thing. We were doing this silly thing and we're letting fighters compete. Compromise. I think if someone like you and someone like holly, you are a similar size.

Speaker 4:          02:36:41       I think you guys should make an agreement and the UFC should say, okay, look, Neesha, what do you weigh right now? You wait like 1:46 when you're in peak condition. What do you weigh? A One? 40 three. Holly, are you cool with 1:43? Yeah. Okay. Well let's just way you guys during camp will weigh you guys sporadically and we'll give you a couple of pounds to play with because realistically the difference between a 143 pound person and 145 pound person is nothing. It's just, it's, it's not, it's not enough, and as long as no one's dehydrated. Let's take hydration level. Interesting concept though, but think about this for minute wrestling week classes typically

Speaker 6:          02:37:16       are typically about five pounds apart, so you get into the bigger ones. So in theory five pounds makes a big difference if when you're talking about manipulating someone else's weight because you're five pounds less, but they're five pounds more, so it's almost like if you think about a double, like in my mind it's almost like a double five pounds can be a lot if there's a lot of wrestling striking. I don't think it's doesn't mean anything. Jujitsu maybe not as much, but maybe getting someone to the ground or being able to sweep someone. I mean the commander sound like a lot. It depends how. Yeah, it depends how big you are. Five pounds to a 300 pound person isn't that much? Five pounds to 100. 15 pound version is a lot. It's a bigger percentage of their body weight. That's a big point. Like when you're talking about like a straw weight or something like that. That's a great point. And I think actually I think holly walks around like someone 60 something. Does she, she's pretty big girl. Well I just feel like she is.

Speaker 3:          02:38:08       Yeah, you could tell she, I really feel like there's gotta be a better way to organize weight classes and I just don't know if forcing someone like holly to compromise your body to get down to 1:35 and then rehydrate up to like 1:50 or whatever she does

Speaker 6:          02:38:25       came into to the whole play because of like bedding me, like back in the day, that's what they would like. Want to show off the fighters and get people to bet on him. Like who do you think's gonna win. So it was kind of like more of a showing than really like a way in like look how big this guy is. He weighs this much and look how big this one. Which one do you think's gonna win? And they would get people to bet and that's Kinda how wins came about the day before. Try to try to get people interested in the fights instead of to both the fighters. Yeah. Well, it's their shirts off and get them on a scale and show how, you know, we'll, you know, the size difference or whatever, you know. So it didn't. They used to do the day of the fight. I don't know, maybe.

Speaker 6:          02:39:01       I'm not sure about boxing. It was the day of the fight. Yeah. I'm pretty sure though that that's like where that kind of came in and then I think they started making more weight classes and that's how it got got like more specific, like you have to be a certain way and I understand that you want to wait, you want people to be within a certain weight of each other, but then the problem is like you can't, there's no way to really monitor that, you know, like some people blow up but tween their camps and other people don't, you know. And how do you. Yeah, like you said, how do you really regularly, like what if, what if I said, you know, I walk around at 1:47 and holly's like, well, you know, I walk around at one 62. Then you're like, well then you can't fight each other. But it's like, she's like, well, when I die it and I do this and it come down, I can make the same weight as as Misha. It's like, how much does she cut though that she cut way more than you? Or does she lower her body? Was sure she lowers the body way. I'm going to guess and say she probably cuts from about one to 50 what I could be wrong.

Speaker 3:          02:40:02       See, then you're only dealing with a few different pounds, right? Like would you say you're like 1:46, one seven. You're dealing with three pounds. Yeah. So that's not, that's not bad, but that's not cutting weight. It's not

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       dehydrating. I think we need to measure the amount of hydration that's in the body.

Speaker 6:          02:40:18       Then what you do is what they instilled in the wrestling programs in high schools essentially they way you. But you also have to pee into a cup and you have to be a certain amount hydrated and then they tell you you can't go below a certain weight because that would mean you're dehydrating yourself. That's, that's definitely a smart scale. And then like also you have to test the hydration of your urine and so you'd be able, I mean that would be really the only way to ensure people are not dehydrating themselves to make a weight. Otherwise you do have to be the same way though. I mean to be, to be fair, to have 135 pound title, it'd be 135 pounds. Like you know,

Speaker 4:          02:40:58       it should probably be a diet thing more than a dehydration thing. I just think that also would, it's just, it's such a dangerous sport already. And to add this extremely dangerous weight cutting aspect to it. Like the guy in Brazil who died last year from weight cutting. Yeah. That can happen. And it's happened in high school wrestling. It's in college wrestling and it's happened in mma a few times now.

Speaker 6:          02:41:20       It's not a good thing. No, it's not. And the ivy ban from my understanding is it's kind of silly because they, they say like, well, you know, because it can mask like a. was it epo

Speaker 4:          02:41:30       or something? They can mask certain type. You have to talk to Novitsky, but it can mask certain types of performance.

Speaker 6:          02:41:36       So from my understanding, what I understand is that cyclist use to use it like right before they knew that the person was going to come and test them, they would hyperhydrate their blood so that it would look like it was a normal, like a normal consistency or whatever level. Yeah. Yeah. He crit levels that they would be d hi. You know, high. Oh hyperhydrate. It's, there wouldn't be as much when they would draw it, but the thing is, is in our sport where first of all were monitored for at least probably three hours before a fight. We're taking the venue in it and a commissioner does not leave our side at all. There's no way to like cheat. There's no, you're not going to ivy up for, you know, real quick, 10 minutes. I'm like, no, like they're in the bathroom with you. You're completely monitored. And I feel like maybe if they were going to abandon, maybe they could do under like a medical. Like if you need an Ivy afterwards and you have to go to the hospital and get one administered or something like there could be a way around it because the thing about cyclists and other sports that they banned it and then they just transferred it over to mma. It doesn't add up because we do cut weight, you know that I agree with that. It makes sense or not taking that into account.

Speaker 4:          02:42:38       The only thing that I would say is that what they're doing by the ban is keeping their checking plastics, that plastic residue that comes from the tubes into your body. And that could be from blood doping. So blood doping could be one way that you could have an advantage in illegal advantage over your opponent. And they could eliminate blood doping by eliminating ivs because this, um, the, the small trace amount of plastics that show up in your blood from use of an ivy in the bag and the, the, the tube and all that stuff. You could use

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       that with blood and gain an endurance advantage over your opponent. You're saying by by using the ivy and putting like injecting like an epo is that you're saying by blood, by putting blood like blood doping, you know, blood doping, you take blood out of your body your way in and then once you weigh in, when they reintroduce that blood back in your body have much more blood because your body's replenish the blood that was missing. Now you all of a sudden have a massive endurance advantage. That's what epo replicates. What epo replicates is what they were getting by just blood doping. That's what blood doping. It's just pulling blood out of your body, storing it in, and then you put your own blood. Yes. You never heard of this? Well, I've heard of evo, but I thought it was like, well, that's what EPO is.

Speaker 3:          02:43:58       Epo is a drug that stimulates your body to like you were at a high altitude. I knew about that, but I didn't think about like taking your own blood out and putting it back in. You just have too much blood. Yes, you would have too much blood, but temporarily it gives you a big endurance advantage. Eventually your body brings your blood back to baseline, but that's what he was doing with epo is doing, is accelerating the amount of red blood cells of your body produces. What blood doping is doing is reintroducing blood that you pulled out. Once your body's replenished that missing blood, now you're throwing even more blood in there. It's probably actually safer than the EPO. Epo can cause strokes and a epo is, is tricky stuff. But yeah, it's uh, it's also a drug that, you know, a lot of fighters have gotten caught for.

Speaker 3:          02:44:46       Well I thought because I didn't think about that, but I thought epo. Is that like you can tell when it's, I guess like the color of the blood or something or a little bit different when it's. Or when you have epo in your system. Like they can tell if it's fake. Well, they didn't use to be able to test for it, but now they can't. Now they can. But I think the two issues with the ivy, the main one is the masking of other performance enhancing drugs, but another one is the possibility of using these bags and these tubes to add additional blood to your body. So, but I've also been told that that can be worked around with a glass syringe and with a glass container for the blood or or ivy fluid. So I don't know if that's true either. So weird. Well, this is going to be a lot of moves and countermoves Novitsky was saying that they figured out a way to make testosterone out of animals.

Speaker 3:          02:45:40       They're taking testosterone from animals. It's indistinguishable from the bio testosterone that your actual body produces versus like the stuff they make now, which they make in some sort of a laboratory environment with wild yams. That's how they. That's how they make testosterone with the yams. That's one of the reasons why a carbon isotope test can differentiate between exogenous testosterone and testosterone. This naturally produced by the body. That's crazy. It's fucking nuts. Know what I mean? You're, you're dealing with this massive, massive sport that's just so crazy that there's. And we have to tell you it's there's the edges that you gain, I mean the edge that you got to think about all the strength and conditioning that you did, all the crazy drills you did, it all came down to that moment in the fifth round where you knew you had to take holly down and in that battle, which was so touch and go like it was like she was countering.

Speaker 3:          02:46:39       You were dragging her down. It was a struggle. Any little edge, any little edge there is the difference between you walking away the new champ and you losing a decision. I mean any little edge there. And that's where it comes down to people and that's where people get fucking shady as fuck, right? Fuck. That's got to be the hardest feeling in the world though, to know that the reason why you did when it wouldn't be satisfying camper, he can't now or if it is then it's just like why? Why, why would you do? Why would you do a sport like that? Like I dunno. I think sometimes people do it because they think other people are doing it too. Like I remember Fitch, I had a conversation with Fitch wants and he was like, um, I would never do anything. This is back when testosterone was legal and he was like, I wouldn't do anything until I'm done.

Speaker 3:          02:47:30       He goes, once I'm done fighting is. Yeah, I would definitely take hormone replacement therapy when I'm older and all this chance. But right now he was, I would want to know that I did everything I did by myself. But then Fitch pissed hot now. Then he got caught, you know, he was fighting Paul Horace and everybody knows Paul might very drawn a little something, you know. And so I think maybe it was one of those things where he's like, look, this is not a level playing field. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna Cheat Myself while this guy is doing something. And that's the problem was like, you know, everyone says cheating. Then you either have to or there's gotta be a way to combat it. And that's the asterix on the pride days. You know, that's the one thing you have to look at it. You gotta go man, amazing times.

Speaker 3:          02:48:12       But who knows what the fuck everybody was doing, who knows what everybody was on 100 percent. Yeah, it's really interesting and it's really interesting that this sport is so, it's, it's so popular now and there's so much riding on it that it really sort of highlights all of this, these moving and pushing of the boundaries and trying to achieve an edge, you know, how much can you achieve through supplementation, like natural things, quarter's eps mushrooms and be 12 and natural supplements. And how much can you achieve through that? And how close does it get to illegal means? Yeah. I don't know. I think when money gets involved it always changes things. State politics changed a lot of changes a lot, so people are willing to do whatever they can to get that win and get that paycheck. I guess some people, not everyone, but how do you have a plan for how long you want to do this?

Speaker 6:          02:49:09       You know, I used to, I used to think I had a plan. That plan went out the window. I just, I turned 29. I just turned 29 last August. And um, I still feel pretty damn good, like, you know, it's weird that I feel that, you know, technically I've been doing this for 10 years, but I still feel like I have so much to learn and so much to offer and I feel like I'm learning so quickly. Like man, you know, I talked about the law of diminishing return, all that I don't feel like that applies to me for some reason. Like I still feel like I'm just evolving so quickly and so rapidly, especially with my striking because it wasn't something I ever focused on before, is that it sounds weird. Like I didn't focus on it. You start folks. Got, I started focusing on it more right before I fought Ronda focusing on it.

Speaker 6:          02:49:58       But I'm, I moved my camp to Las Vegas like halfway through that training camp, which was, it needed to happen, but it was bad timing in that I'm just, I'm getting like a couple of new coaches and we don't have the lingo down yet. And it's like a language you learned between your coaches and we didn't have that. So there was definitely some hiccups. But, um, after that, you know, I won firefights and won a title, you know, so I think I definitely made the right move, just maybe the timing was bad, but I started focusing on it, you know, six weeks before that camp. And then since then I've been working with my coach, Jimmy Gifford, um, you know, and he's helped me tremendously and focused more on my strength and conditioning actually making a regiment and doing, doing all the things that I guess you're supposed to do as a professional athlete because before what I was doing just was kind of, I was a little bit ignorant and I worked hard but worked harder, not smarter kind of a thing. Now I have people back, we have a nutritionist, I was sports Dr. have a strength coach, I have a striking coach, have a to mma coaches and wrestling coach and they've got it all like. And I feel like I finally figured it out. Finally, have a good gym where I'm at and everything too. So.

Speaker 3:          02:51:04       Well, that's where it all comes together, right? Is when your dedication matches your talent, matches your focus and your desire. And it all comes together. And now as a champion, do you feel like do, do, do you have more confidence now being a champion? Do you feel different? Like do you feel like a fucking did it 100 percent, but I belong here.

Speaker 6:          02:51:24       It's one thing to believe you can and it's another to know you can, you know, believing you can. I mean that's important. That's crucial. You have to believe. But it's entirely different once you know, you're like, and now I know not, not only do I know, but everyone else knows too, you know, that's a different feeling. It's a whole different animal. It's a whole different ballgame. Like I, something's changed inside me that I can't explain some things just different. And um, felt like I hit a new level.

Speaker 3:          02:51:53       You feel very satisfied. I am saying this, I can tell

Speaker 6:          02:51:56       super confident, super satisfied, super confident. I was still hungry or I still feel like I have a lot to accomplish, you know, I have, I think I have a really tough match. And Amanda definitely do. She's mad at Nunez is no joke. No, she's dangerous job. I remember. Did you watch her fight with Julia Budd? Strikeforce, but she knocked her out with that one punch and Julie Bud was the bigger, stronger girl and a striker. She knocked out. I mean, she's got one punch knockout power. She showed up against a good man. You know, she, she, she beat. She'd be down. Sarah Mcmahon. She beat her down. She hit her so hard. That just made her on it quit. And then she climbed on her back and choked her out. Like, man, she's good. She's well dangerous. He's very dangerous. You know? I think that she might have an issue with cardio if I was going to pick out, pick out something that might be something you maybe she's not as efficient in the cage, but she's.

Speaker 6:          02:52:43       We are working to change that. No, she knows this is a five round fight. I can't. I can't rely on someone getting tired. That's never a good game plan. Like, okay, I'm just going to try to stay out of harm's way until she gets tired. Like, well, she seems to explode and fights and then drain the gas tank. She's trying to stop people and if it doesn't work out that way, she has a little bit of an issue ever wins or something or first round finishes. She's a monster. Yeah. Very, very strong striker. Did very physically strong person. She's kind of like a brown or black belt in Jujitsu and a brown or a black belt in judo. Yep. Very well rounded. Yeah. There's not that many girls in our division that are that well rounded. Um, so she doesn't have a lot of holes in her game besides, besides a seeming to hit a wall sometimes in a fight and yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:53:26       with her as one of the things that I said about holly and the Rhonda fight, it's like you look at how accomplished holly is outside of the UFC and you wait until the moment which you could put it all together inside the octagon and she might put it all together inside the octagon when the moment is the biggest, when she has to rise to the occasion. That might, when you push her back against the wall, it might be when you see her at her best and it turned out to be exactly that and someone like Amanda, she's going to realize like this is the time, this is the opportunity to put it all together. Can't half ass a thing in training thing with nutrition thing with your mind. She has to show up 100 percent focused and so for someone like you, you have to look at her like her potential

Speaker 6:          02:54:08       and look at all of all the girl would beat Sara Mcmann. That's the one that I'm training, you know, and even better than that girl because we have to assume she's evolved. That's the best. I think I've seen her look so I have to assume like she's going to be better than that even. Do you have goals

Speaker 4:          02:54:23       as far as like what you want to do with the title? How long do you want to hold it? Do you have any thoughts in mind of like must be opponents like is getting Rhonda back in the auction?

Speaker 6:          02:54:34       Yeah, that's important. I need that. Like that has to happen. That's very important to me and I have Amanda had of me, I do not want to look pastor because you think that would be a huge mistake. It's not one that I want to make as a veteran in my career. That would be a rookie move. Um, but you know, in the back of my mind, of course, like the fight with Ronda is something I want to happen and you don't know when it will happen. It could be anticipated for November. I've heard that be tossed around in the UFC that she's planning on coming back and maybe it might be Madison Square Garden. That would be great. I want to focus on that. I want to focus on Amanda, but I know in the back of my mind and I want, I want that fight. Like I want that to happen.

Speaker 6:          02:55:11       I think it's so important to me and my career to go and beat Ronda and prove everyone else. Like I've been an underdog in most of my fights. I had been the person that people have always counted out in my entire career, my entire life. Most people are telling me, you can't, you couldn't, you shouldn't, you wouldn't, and I'm, you know, that's, I'm fine with that. I'm perfectly fine with that. I am at the best point in my career and Rhonda is at the worst. You know, she's going through what I've already been through time and time again and I have built myself back up from that point. Time and time again. I know that I can do that. I'm confident in that. Here I am standing the strongest that I've ever stood and I've already been through that. I've already been head kicked and knocked out.

Speaker 6:          02:55:52       That happened to me before, like I picked myself up, but pull myself up by my bootstraps, but one foot back in front of the other and worked. Got My strike first world title. I lost the Toronto pick myself back up, but one phone interview the other got back on the horse, fought, fought, fought, fought. Ronda Rousey was devastated, crushed, thought my world was just falling down around me. Coming to an end, pack up. We're going to put one foot in from the other guy back on the horse, and now here I am, the world champion. You know, I know that I'm tough. I know that I have what it takes to beat Ronda. Many people don't believe that. That's okay. I've been in this position before. Many most people didn't think I was going to beat holly. Most people don't think holly was gonna. Beat. Ronda doesn't matter to me what other people think.

Speaker 6:          02:56:34       It matters what I believe and what I know and I'm the question mark is how is Rhonda going to come back from this? I know what I've been hearing from Rhonda in the media and the press. She's been a little quiet lately, but before that it wasn't what I would have expected to hear from someone who really wants to come back and he was really, really a fighter at the core. She's a great athlete. She's a great fighter. She's accomplished a lot of things. Credit where credit's due, you know, I give her a round of applause for everything she's been able to accomplish. I'll tell you what, every time I've ever lost in my career, I went bananas to get back in their ballistic. I was like, I have to like right now, just like holly was like, they're like, when do you want to fight again?

Speaker 6:          02:57:18       Just like tomorrow. I meesha. Now. That's what you want to hear. When someone has a devastating loss, they want to get back in there right now and face that person right now or or someone else, just get that loss of the record. Erase it. When I lost the cat Zingano, I freaked out. I freaked out. I called Sean Shelby and I was like, get me another fight right now. He was like, your noses even heal. I don't give a fuck. I want to. I want to fight. I want it now. I want to know when it's coming up like right now or I'm going to freak out. I don't know what to tell you, but I'm going to lose my shit if I don't have like a fight on the horizon, lose it. And then I hear Rhonda, like I'm going to take a year off and I'm gonna. You know, I'm going to do this. I'm like, that just doesn't sound like someone who really wants this anymore. And I think that fight might've broke her. I could be wrong, but I think something inside of her is different than it was before. Um, maybe she's not broken, but it's different

Speaker 4:          02:58:12       because how much do you think of factor is how much of a factor do you think success is in the park in terms of she's doing movies. She's, she was a darling always late night television shows and everybody wanted to hang out with us doing these commercials with, you know, seth rogen on television, like how much of a factor is on?

Speaker 6:          02:58:33       Well, she asked security, now she has job security outside the UFC. Sushi doesn't really need that anymore. And I think maybe that's also something on her mind is like, does she really want this? Because winning is awesome. It's great. It's easy. It's like when you win, everybody loves you. Everybody supports you. Everybody's there. Everybody's on your train. When you lose fucking sucks. It sucks. And only the people that really love your still really, really there for you. Everyone else was just like, Eh, whatever the loser, and then you have the social media, you know, White Knights that come out and want to tell you what a piece of shit you are and how you're never gonna accomplish anything and you'll never win another fight and you might as well just quit and retire, blah, blah blah. So those people and you have to make a choice, you know, and my choice is always been the to do, to, to, to keep fighting, you know, to add. It just don't. I don't recognize. There's a lot of things I recognize in Ronda that I can, I can recognize her greatness, I can recognize her championship, I can recognize things I don't identify with that I don't identify with. Sitting on that last for a year, I cannot understand it. If it was me, it would have eaten me alive inside and out to. I couldn't have done it. I couldn't be making a movie. I couldn't be doing that. I would, it would just.

Speaker 4:          02:59:47       But does she? I don't think she has a choice. I think if you have movie contracts, I think you have to fulfill them.

Speaker 6:          02:59:52       How do you, I dunno, does Conrad have to show up for. But showing up for press conferences is one thing, but I don't think, I think she could have. She could have fought because they, they said they had anticipated for her to come back at UFC 200. They wanted that and they and, and Dana said she could've but should, she? She could have but should she.

Speaker 4:          03:00:14       Well I think that could have and should, she was because she had to do a movie for three months, so like doing the movie for three months would have taken three months outside of her camp. And you've done a movie before. You know what it's like you're on the set all day. It's 16 hour days. It's long and grueling. You don't have time to train, but after a loss like that, I think you really have to have enough time to actually focus and then on top of that to getting, getting flatlined like that. Like you have to have some time to recover. Recover your head.

Speaker 6:          03:00:43       Yeah, absolutely. I just don't know if a year that would. I'm just saying that would crush me. I wouldn't be able to do what she's doing right now. I wouldn't physically be able to like to deal with that for years. And if I had to, I think it would eat me alive. Like I think I'd be so depressed and so I'm sure it's eating her alive

Speaker 3:          03:01:00       too. But how do you sit on it for a year then? How do you do that? Do what you gotta do. Can't. I couldn't. Well, you know, it's all speculation. We only, we don't know until she comes back.

Speaker 6:          03:01:10       But the other thing too is like, no, she's like, you know, she had her, you're going to her downs or her really, really low, which I empathize with. I've been there, um, you know, but then she said, you know, I was thinking about, you know, these all these negative thoughts. And, and um, then I looked up on the hill and she said this on the Ellen show. I looked up and I saw Travis Brown and I realized, you know, I've got to stick around to have his babies and I thought like what? What went through my mind is like I gotta get back and get my title back. I gotta get back and win a fight like it. It just seemed like her mindset was different than what I would expect a fighter's mindset to be. Does that make sense at all? But I'm trying. What I'm saying is like, it didn't seem like her motivation was to fight and win again.

Speaker 6:          03:01:54       It was. There was other things. Now I'm not saying she's not going to come back and be great or come back and fight. Not Questioning that and questioning where her true motivation is coming from because I think while she was winning, it was so awesome. Like she's like, well, yeah, I want to keep doing this course. I want to keep it, keep them crushing girls. I'm demolishing them. I'm a star. All these great things are coming now. She already has that. She's already making movies. She already has millions of millions of dollars. Is Her true motivation? Was it just, you know, keeping that undefeated streak because she talked about that so much, you know, I will retire undefeated w and then she, she even said like, I don't know, I'm questioning what am I doing now? Like, you know, now I'm not going to ever retire undefeated. So what is my, you know, maybe I'm meant for this. Maybe I met, she doesn't really know that was her identity was like to be undefeated in this sport. So if, if that's not the goal anymore, I just don't know. Like I feel like I sent something off, I send something is not right in her mindset and I think she's going to come back and I think she's going to fight anything. She'll fight hard, but I just don't know if she still has it after a brutal loss like that, you know, if she's still hungry enough. Those are fighting words. Restate. Is she $100?

Speaker 3:          03:03:09       That's the question. What you're doing right now is you're throwing up the bat signal, right?

Speaker 6:          03:03:15       Yeah. Well that's how I feel I'm going to down now. I get a lot of shit because people are like, oh, you know, he, that's not what I, I don't, I don't apologize for anything that I say unless I really say it's something that was, that I didn't mean to say that was hurtful to someone and I'm like, oh, I fucked up. But honestly, if it's my opinion is my opinion, if you don't like it, I'm not. I'm not gonna apologize for my opinion. Don't apologize for anything that I have to say about the way I feel about Rhonda, the way I feel about any, any of these situations, you know, so I've just, I'm going to be as transparent.

Speaker 3:          03:03:43       I don't think you're saying anything disrespectful either and I don't think you, I think as a champion and that's what you are, you, you're analyzing someone's mindset and you're totally entitled to that.

Speaker 6:          03:03:54       Yeah. And I have a lot of respect for Rhonda was an athlete. You know, a lot of guys think you'll ever be friends after all said and done. Never. I don't think so. No. I think she thinks that I've done so many things and like she, I don't think she would ever. I think she blames me for things that I didn't even do. So that mean how do you even get around that? Right. You know, like I heard when you guys did your interview, she said something like that I called a promotion and like tried to get crispy or like mess with him before his fight or something like that. That I guess he, I guess he was contracted to another promotion and he wasn't supposed to be while he was on the ultimate fighter. And I guess that that Dana, I received a call and then they thought that I, she thought that I did that.

Speaker 6:          03:04:39       I'm like, first of, first of all, like I didn't even know he signed to another organization at all and if you know that can be was, it didn't even, wouldn't have even crossed my mind. Like I'm too, like you said, I'm too easy going to even think of something like that. And I'm not malicious by any means. I have nothing against Krispy. Oh. But I think she thought that I tried to like mess with him, like I called the promoter of whatever organization, little small contract, don't even know how I would have known that. How would you even know that? How do you know? But this is the same girl that ripped page for, for congratulating holly. Like she has her way of thinking and she's going to hate me until the day she dies and I'm okay with that. That's fine. We don't need to be friends. That's okay. You know, I'm perfectly fine with that. All right. Yeah. Well listen,

Speaker 4:          03:05:28       congratulations and everything. What you did not Holly Holm fight was fucking amazing. It's awesome. Thank you. And I think you're a great representative for women's martial arts, for martial arts, period. But as a champion, I think you were a great representative. Just your personality, the way you carry yourself is very admirable and I think you're a great role model for people that are coming up and looking at what a champion behaves like. I appreciate it, Joe Words. Thanks for being on the podcast too. Thanks for hanging out and for finally having fun anytime.

Speaker 6:          03:05:58       Bother you enough to get me on here.

Speaker 4:          03:06:00       People bother me cause it's not that I can do. I only have so much time. Thank you very much. All right folks. We'll be back Friday with Ian Edwards. See you then.
