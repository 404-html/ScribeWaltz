Speaker 1:          00:00:03       We live,

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       you just gave me a three. There was no to those. That was just a three. I get, I keep waiting for the to the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by. If you go to a Rogan.ting.com, it will explain what the fuck ting is and it will also give you $50 off of any of the smartphones that ting has in their, their lineup they have. Um, what ting is, is like a non evil cell phone company and what they're doing is they use the sprint backbone. You don't have to have a contract, you cancel anytime you want. It's, there's a lot of great deals where you can combine your minutes, like you and your wife can share minutes or something like that. Or you and your husband or you and your boyfriend. If you're a guy. I don't give a fuck. Okay. That's not what I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          00:00:52       What I'm saying is ting has some pretty dope phones. All the high end android phones, you can get 50 bucks off of one of those. And the way they have it set up is they use the same backbone that's apprentice. Sprint is on, so you're not on a mickey mouse coverage, you get like a, like one of the top cell phone providers in the country as far as like your signal goes. Joey Diaz swears by that sprints shit dog. That's all. That's all. I have a goal with sprint to the end. Um, but it also has four g connections and they also have great fonts like Brian and I both have the Samsung Galaxy s three and it's fucking sick. It's a great phone. It makes iphones look really stupid. Like if you try to like, look at pictures and go on the Internet and it makes so much sense.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       This sweet camera to. It's a pretty, pretty fucking dope phone. They all, they have ever pretty much everyone now. I think they even have the note. Yeah, they have the note too. So, uh, they, they, uh, they essentially have all of the high end. They have the note. Yeah. The Samsung Galaxy note to which is the newest one. I'm all the high end android devices. They even have flip phones if you're a fucking Weirdo and you want to get some little shitty ass flip phone that doesn't do anything and you get a text with your thumbs if that's your shit, Dana White, just going to say this, anti tend to that. He's got a little flip phones. But um, if you're, if you're into that, they have that stupid shit as well, but it's an excellent company. It's an ethical company. They provide you with an excellent service and it's very reasonable prices and they haven't set up that if you don't use the minutes, like if you say you're going to use a certain amount, you only use half of them, they refund you money on your next bill.

Speaker 2:          00:02:29       I mean it's just a fucking great company and that's why we, uh, that's what we do business with them. We're also brought to you by onnit.Rogan.ting.com soccer. We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com on ig.com. That's o n n I t. and if you've never been there, Josh Barnett, you should go because it's all shit that you would be into. It's manly shit. Like we sell kettle bells and battle ropes. Okay. Battle Bells. We need to get those. How do you see that? They have. Well, we have a bunch of different fitness shit. We have um, a medicine balls, which I've just started using medicine balls. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:03:03       That's excellent. You can put bengay on your nuts, right? That is a painful medicine. Yeah. Have you ever actually put Bengay and your boss? Have you ever done that? Just for a recreational purpose. I shaved my balls once and I put aftershave on my balls to see what it would feel like. Oh my. So you're getting a blow job to remind her of her dad was a terrible mistake. It was unbelievably painful. I thought. How painful could it be? It's just, you know, skin like you look, if you shave your face, then you put after shave on, you get the splash of light, but it's okay. I'm like, how much worse could it be on my balls? It's a lot worse. It's exponentially worse. So totally different experience. Uh, what shape did you. Were you, were you a Stetson man? No, I went with one of those black velvet. Those blick or what did I put on my face? No spice old spice. That's good. Yeah. That can go with. I go with old spice deodorant. Old Spice Guy. Like old spice. Did you do the home alone slap to your balls afterwards? No, I squeeze them tight because they were furious. I grabbed them and squeeze them as if I was somehow or another. They're going to stop the pain by squeezing my balls and I'm telling you, you're just going to give a girl a flashback or. Oh my God, it's Grandpa.

Speaker 3:          00:04:17       GRANDPA again. Well, you know the old spice on the COC. Oh, Jesus did not know where you're going with that. Just wherever I go with it, it's always going to be bad. Bad, bad. Josh Barnett. I like the sound of this ting. That sounds pretty awesome. Although at first I thought it was like someone's massive joke on like Asians and cell phones. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:04:39       That would be rude. That would be rude as fuck. No, it's just a name. What is t? His is a Tang. Does it mean anything? What is it tingling. Is it like a technical term or anything like that? Oh No, like Ping Ping is if you send a packet on the Internet, so somewhere when it hits the next server it sends you like the time and that's a pain. The server was important back in the quake days.

Speaker 3:          00:05:02       Oh yeah. You got a ping. The server is checked to see what your latency. Yeah. You want to be able to fuck people up when they can't fuck you up and then you. But no matter what, when you're losing, you're doing shitty. It's like, Oh God damn it, I fucking lag the lag. Got Me. Me.

Speaker 2:          00:05:17       Anyway, on it.com o n n I t we have a bunch of different packages now, or you can actually buy a kettle bells and that, uh, excellent.

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       Joe Rogan podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:08:21       So many times we started this podcast off and I never say who I'm talking to him until about an hour in, so I will just say it right up front. A manly man, a man of character, a man's man who likes muscle cars and fucking psycho music and it's an intellectual dude, a guy you sit down and talk to Josh Barnett, lives in channel, bring her home. I break bread and bring, bring me on home to introduce me to mom, tell her about raping and pillaging and not necessarily, but if you lived in another era, you might be on the menu, could be to make a good conquer. If you came in on a boat and everybody else was doing, you would go out and do your thing. You know it. I will be at that and be like drunk fast or you send them a bitch. So, uh, what's new for you? Man? I know you're going to be in the end. The last strikeforce card, right? Which is in January for folks that don't know Josh, Josh is a former UFC heavyweight champion, a king of pancrase. How many other titles did you get?

Speaker 4:          00:09:13       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:09:16       bunch of grappling titles,

Speaker 4:          00:09:18       grapping titles. I think I had a, a smoothest penis head.

Speaker 2:          00:09:24       If we were going to have a manliest men board of approval, I would have to have you on this manliest men board of approval. You're clearly about as manly as it gets. I think I appreciate it. We can go to you and we can get like real strict, like no nonsense. I saw you straightened up dudes nose with a fucking pencil. Got Video of it on the end of that dude, guys, those broken Josh like you want me to fix it? I'll fix it right now. Faced with a fucking pencil, shoves a pencil. This dude's nodes and breaks it back and you see it. You'd see the crunching and see if he can find it because it's pretty fun. It's pretty fucking funny.

Speaker 4:          00:09:59       Yeah. Uh, I'm, I'm there for, for that boob jobs. Pretty much any kind of general surgery.

Speaker 2:          00:10:05       Did he break his nose sparring? Was it like, did it actually with, uh, with, uh, he was doing snatches. Oh, the barbell. And somehow he manages to waylay himself right in the face. He crushed it.

Speaker 4:          00:10:16       He nailed well, he'd already mangled it. Pretty good. Uh, uh, doing rugby earlier on. And, uh, uh, I think in college maybe something like that, he'd been doing rugby for years, so you'd already known the pleasures of a broken nose, but this was just out of nowhere. So,

Speaker 2:          00:10:33       you know, there's an interesting debate that's going on right now, uh, amongst people that are football fans, but that are also realizing how much damage these players take and they're trying to figure out what to do about it. And one of the more interesting ideas that it's being presented is the idea to make them wear leather helmets to take away these big fucking hard helmets that allow you to crash into each other full speed and just give you a little something that protects your skin. And that's basically all you got. And you can't have the same strategy can go head to head like that. You can't crash into each other, no pants, leather helmets. And the idea is that if they, if they rocked it down away, we would avoid a lot of these crazy high speed collision. People would be more realistic about it.

Speaker 4:          00:11:14       I think it would cut down on the high speed collisions. Uh, you wouldn't, you wouldn't have people blowing into each other near as hard. I've had the argument with people that are big rugby fanatics for years that I'm like, look, rugby guys don't hit as hard as football players. I mean, it's not just that they have pads on us, they're huge, they're running fast and those, you know, the pads in addition help you to just like lay everything you got into another human being. However, I mean, let's be honest, look at these monsters. I mean, you stick them in leather, they're still gonna start smashing into each other. I don't know if it's going to stop from people getting as hurt as bad or

Speaker 2:          00:11:47       right. But the problem is like the sports already developed into what it is and to try to take it a step back. Things don't usually go a step back. Do you want to watch guys in leather helmet? No. Like patty cake and grab each other's balls and there's a video that's being played above your head.

Speaker 3:          00:12:01       Oh yeah. Two bends in the states. No, it's just so gnarly. But this is some known. Don said, Shit, look, he just opens a pathway. I'd like to say that I was just looking to see whatever I could find a Jamun pianist, his Schnoz anyways, just for the hell of it, but it actually makes sense. Oh yeah, it totally makes sense. If you can get it to heal in the correct position, it won't be nearly as fucked up as if the cartilage is all bent up in there to get mine fixed. I broke it when I was a little kid. I fell down a flight of stairs my whole life. It was fucking nights were really the only way to really do it if you have a bad enough break, is to, uh, to have like a, an ear, nose and throat doctor go in there and do the proper stuff to it. But it's, it's a hellacious coming back from it. I didn't think it was. No. Well, I've heard, I've heard of people like crying blood out of their eyes and that's pretty cool and a metal sense. Save the buggers. I'll show you some passive one. Oh my God. Let me show you something because you can't even believe these are real. I, uh, I showed one of my buddy Tom, me and Tommy,

Speaker 2:          00:13:00       we were, we were, uh, at the airport and I blew this fucking booger into this tissue. It did not look real. It looked like it came from another planet. Blood clot fucking insane. It was huge. First of all. I mean, I, I've, I've got the photos, I've saved them. I mean, there was no way I was ever going to let this go. It's just going to take a few. Um, I have a lot of God damn pictures in here. I've got to go back to when it was, which I think was about three years ago. Oh, that was, it changed.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       Oh, that's my picture. When I was back in the day, I'd hit it. I would do, I would hit it. And it's me trying to find these buggers. Ma'Am. Something literally here couldn't. You couldn't imagine this coming out of a human being. I've put this online, I'm sure. No, I definitely did. I put it on my twitter page. So Brian, if you could find it, uh, Joe Rogan's bloody snot on twitter. I bet there's a photo of it up there. As long as it stays up there. I'm imagining some comic book villain of a booger. It's just unbelievable. I mean, I wouldn't be talking it up this much if it wasn't really unbelievable. But for ladies and gentlemen, if you have a broken nose, if you get the inside of the nose fucked up, if you, if you know, like, I know like mayhem had thought about getting his fix but he's still fighting.

Speaker 2:          00:14:18       So it's like I can't do it until I'm done. But if you get a chance, that's the only one. That's what it looks like. A, like cartilage and everybody's like, just pieces is unbelievable. And that was the only one that's not even the biggest one. I had some other ones that were even bigger. They were so ridiculous. I blew them out and I looked at him in my hand. I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding. How'd you feel if that thing came out like a, like a potato chip came out of my, uh, blood giant bloody Nacho. That's what it was like. Yeah. There's a look at the size of that fucking thing. That thing came out of my note. What did it tastes like? Calgon take it wasn't good. It something I would recommend you try and um, it was, it was unbelievable. I would, I would shoot those out of my nose. I'm like, it leaves out here. Here I was, I got a bunch of pictures I really need to, to get my nose fixed. I broke it a long time ago,

Speaker 4:          00:15:04       kid. And then I broke it again. Really a in this first round of that super ball tournament and it just, it bleeds easy now,

Speaker 2:          00:15:11       which is a problem. So that they, what do they do? They cauterize the inside. They've tried doing that. But the way to get up, I need a doc to get. That's impressive. That's unbelievable, right? I blew 100 of those three or four months. I hope you have that framed in your house. I should, I should just stay in my office or at least put it in one of those led, rotating picture frames. The dog, the kid. Fuck. That's a great idea, dude. I might do that. I'll do that and put one up in here. That's what we'll do for the, for the studio. Um, so, uh, you're on the last strike force card. Yes. Is it January

Speaker 4:          00:15:52       twelfth in the wonderful Oklahoma City? Uh, we'll be down there a beating the crap out of each other for the last time under the strikeforce banner. But uh, it'll be on showtime as usual so people will be able to see it.

Speaker 2:          00:16:04       What did you say, Tim Kennedy's pissed off. He thinks that he was mad a little bit, you know, those, uh, those, uh, high level military dudes, they tend to be a little high strung on edge. Yeah. But he was talking about how he thinks of all these guys are pulling out because it's the last card they just don't want to fuck because it won't mean enough to them. They want to just try to get fights in the UFC. So they're just pulling out of the last strikeforce. I think that was what he was insinuating. He was definitely saying that

Speaker 4:          00:16:30       beyond the realm of possibility for me, I look at it and people love to complain about, oh well you don't, you don't, you're not fighting this guy. You're not fighting. We're not fighting that fight. I fight the people that they put in front of me and, and you know, they're like, well, who the hell is this? And slash or guy. I'm like, I don't fucking know and I don't fucking care. You know what I mean? He's just another fucking victim that. And no matter what, if it was Nan door or junior dos Santos, I get paid the same right now. So I really don't give a shit. I, I fight who steps up and uh, you know, that's just the way that you're fighting. He is impressive looking. I'll give him that. He does look like he's a man door, Gill Amino Guild Amino. That doesn't sound Australian to me, but whatever.

Speaker 4:          00:17:13       Is that where you're supposedly from? That's where he's from. He's called the Hun. So I plan. I can dig that. The hunt fights for master. That's pretty intense shit. Yeah, that sounds a like a like some sort of fantasy movie. He's, it looks like a big giant end of the world type dude. He does. He's got a nice big thick brow over his eyes. Well his tactics may strikes fucking gigantic and it looks like actually building. Well they shot it up, you know, tricks of camera. He's like six, two, two, 2130. So he's a pretty decent sized, smaller size of the heavy I think. Just think he likes to do a lot of curls. Okay. And he's probably got the tiny legs.

Speaker 2:          00:17:51       Oh, it's one of those dudes and he's fighting in the UFC. How's that possible? Well, maybe it's just a,

Speaker 4:          00:17:56       I don't know, man, but he's a, he's got some fights under his belt. He's not, he's not like, he's never been there before. And he's 36. He's, he's gonna come in fit and I. and he thinks this is his opportunity to fuck somebody up and you think it's going to be me. So yeah, it looks so that's a big step up for that dude. And you know

Speaker 2:          00:18:13       that happens man, a lot in mma where guys that someone was talking about Danny Lozan, Joe Lowe's, his brother first fight in UFC fight, Spencer Fisher, that's pretty big. That happens. That kind of shit happens. This guy. That's a giant opportunity for him. But really he should like if you looked at it like in the world of outside of MMA, if it was like a boxing thing, that guy would have to go through a lot more hoops and ladders before he gets to a Josh Barnett level.

Speaker 4:          00:18:41       That's true. And then the thing with boxing also is that they, they put their cars together based on how they can promote it for the back end dollar or two specific to the bouts themselves were with him May. It's just like, Hey, we have a card or on it. Let's just have him fight.

Speaker 2:          00:18:56       Yeah. Because a guy like this, I mean obviously he's got, he's got a few fights under his belt, but you know, you're a former champion, you're a big name, both in pride, big name in strikeforce, big name in the UFC. Like that doesn't make any sense. Like this is a guy that uh, if you were banking, you know, if you see, like if it was like Bob Arum, something like this, they will probably never scheduled like this. They go, wait a minute, we can make a lot of money. I've charged Barnett. We got to move them into a good position to get them a big name fight. There's very few big name guys, especially outside of the UFC that at this point there's only a few and you're one of them, you know, and outside of you, there's really not that many anymore, you know, now who else is left?

Speaker 4:          00:19:35       Just me now. Cormier and a

Speaker 2:          00:19:39       and a fader is done. He, he says he, he was, he was going to retire. He was, he was thinking about it apparently at one point in time. Then he had a loss and his family. And uh,

Speaker 4:          00:19:48       yeah, I think he's a, I believe he's retired. I don't really see him coming back. If he does, it won't be for some time. I just don't think that fighting is so absolutely necessary to him. I think he's, he may be looking at different stages in his life and I think from, from how I know him anyways, he seems pretty content with the things that he's doing outside of fighting and happy with family and church and things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:20:12       Yeah, he definitely doesn't have the same last for it that he had. Like when he fought cro cop, like back in those days I, I considered that like his prime, like the one of the first cro cop fight I think. Uh, he just, he, he went after him on the feet, like he basically walked down like one of the best kick boxers and mma.

Speaker 4:          00:20:32       Well that's the thing, when you're fighting a good striker, you, you got a and, and that fueled or wanted to. Needed to put him on his back. So he had to close that distance. And the only way you can't just walk into them, you're going to get tagged up, meaning he got cracked with a lot of good shots. He had yet to be aggressive. You have to be quick coming forward and then initiate those opportunities to put them on his back. You know, every time I fought cro cop, I came forward to. Because again, if I, if I want to put them on the floor, I can't do it backing up. And everybody that backs up the more distance you give a guy like cro cop, especially back then, the more he would look for is opportunity to land kill shot, then fucking left high kick or just a middle kick or you know, he was a hellacious low kicker too.

Speaker 4:          00:21:10       But uh, uh, he uh, filter look great in his last couple of bouts. Looked real sharp, but I think it was more just to prove to himself that he could do it. That, you know, all right, well I have the ability and I can stay in here and be a top guy. But I've done this and I'm good. And I guess his brother just recently retired also, and then uh, um, uh, Tim Silvia is still out there and around, I don't know, I mean he's got a pedigree and he has still a pretty high high record of wins versus losses and Arlovski is trying to make a run back into the limelight as far as being a top everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       Well, I lost. He's actually doing really well. He's uh, he, uh, he actually just beat Tim Wright. He beat Tim and then he was disqualified because of an illegal soccer kick. Yeah. I have a weird rule. It's a one. Is that one FC? Is that Matt? Uh, Matt Hume's old,

Speaker 4:          00:22:00       a pancreas pro pankration rules in Washington and they had this open guard a call things. So it was like the, I guess the deal was you, you're not supposed to spend a long time. So I fought and washing.

Speaker 2:          00:22:13       Well, let me explain it to people that don't know what we're talking about for most fights, you can't kick a guy in the head when he's down. You can only kick the body and the legs. But in pride and the old school days, you could do anything. You could stomp guys, you could soccer, kick them, you could do anything. And a lot of people miss that technique. So there's open guard thing is where they allow the kicks stops as well. Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:22:37       maybe no stomps. Maybe just kicks. I believe it just kicks A. I'd have to pencil long, but uh, um, but once they call open guard, then you're free to do, you know, I, I believe it was taken from Valley Tudo Japan or something similar way back in the day, but it was like if you're on your back, guy can go ahead and come around. And soccer kick at your head.

Speaker 2:          00:22:57       Is the idea that if you've rocked and you're down, is that when he would not, when would he not let you? Soccer of all fours I believe. Okay. So if you scratch like, you've, you're down, you're hurt, then you can't soccer kick guy. Look, then he would stop. But if he went to his back, that would be open guard and you can talk. Okay. That's interesting. So only when the guy's on his back, because I guess the idea is that your legs and your hands are up in front of you, so you're protecting yourself. That totally. That actually is very logical. The Japanese had a lot of very logical, uh, approaches to mma. One of them that I really liked was that 10 minute first round. Yes. That's a brutal fight. That really separated the men from the boys. Did that round was the endurance breaker. I liked it. I loved that you go out there and you just get it on some. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:23:39       You, you have to strategize your wind and your endurance. Uh, but it, I mean, we didn't stop a lot of us from still just going nonstop, 10 minutes, man. We'd just go for it. And uh, uh, coming from a guy like me who started in the days of no time limits, I mean, right.

Speaker 2:          00:23:54       And well, you know, for a guy like you also, it's sometimes you would work for a while to get a takedown and you finally get to take down. You only got 20 seconds left than around. The guy can defend. But if there's five minutes and 20 seconds, he's fucked right now and get a lot of work in on a guy and five slash 12 that really favor. I mean that was one of the main arguments for not having three minute rounds in the first place is that you wanted to give the grappler sometime to work once he completed the tank down. Right. But if you look at like, like consider the exertion that they put off in a boxing rounds, boxing the high level of boxing runs, it's really not even nearly as devastating as a high level MMA right now.

Speaker 4:          00:24:28       It's different because you don't have that muscle fatigue from constant wear and and resistance and it's a different sort of conditioning. Or you can take a guy who's an excellent wrestler who's got fantastic when, when it comes to to contact and, and, and resistance and strength and balance that way against another opponent. But you get out there and you start putting all these punches together and all of a sudden his wind is gone, got blasted because it's a different. It's more akin to more of an aerobic. Anaerobic just wind based, then it's a different. It's completely different.

Speaker 2:          00:24:58       Yeah. It's interesting how it doesn't apply, like fitness does not apply across the board. No, no, no. And that's the thing is that the Olympic,

Speaker 4:          00:25:05       uh, the Olympic committees have done all these, uh, these studies like committees, whatever, the, uh, all the people that come with all the science and the training behind these Olympic athletes and that is, you can do sports specific training. You can go ahead and shoot doubles with bands on, you can punch with dumbbells, you can do all this stuff to try and simulate doing your sport, but in the end, the only thing that makes you better at your sport and the most, especially in terms of endurance and everything else is to actually do your sport. But because your body learns how to relax, it has muscle memory. It has a um, um, your, your brain understands all the movements and dynamics of exactly what you're doing and that's how it learns to be as most efficient as possible in your sport. Yeah. And so it's great.

Speaker 4:          00:25:51       You know, all these strength conditioning guys have come out of the woodwork, especially I love all the guys that have no fight training or fights under their belt and they want to go and they train all these fighters with all this stuff. They see a Jim Jones or crossfit or a now westside barbell and these are all great systems that have amazing things to take from it, but I could have the best workout in the world, but it might not be the best workout for this particular type of athlete and not to mention he can do the best work out in the world all day long. If his time in the sport that he's actually doing is not being applied, then it's a waste. You're not, you're not going to really be able to make the most of it.

Speaker 2:          00:26:28       You feel like there's a certain level of the game were strengthened. Condition is absolutely necessary. We can get to like a rory macdonald athlete level, like absolutely. You know, I mean this kid at 23, 24, something like that. He's young, he's a freakish and, and he's so fucking athletic and he's doing these incredible strength and conditioning workouts along with all his sports specific shit. It's, I feel like I absolutely agree with you that the most important thing is technique and efficiency and training and sparring and timing and Mitt work and all that good stuff. But there's also, you get to a Roy Mcdonald level where he's got Roy Mcdonald. He has that as well. You know, he's got all the training all the time, putting in, in all the intensity and the drills. But then he also has this

Speaker 4:          00:27:20       and that's, that was I actually, I, uh, uh, unofficially named that laugh that UFC on Fox a card I called the UFC on Fox five speed kills. Basically everybody who is faster, more conditioned and quicker beat their opponents. Well really what it came down to, you know, a Benson, a Rory Gustafson, all of them were quicker. They were quicker to the punch, they were better. They seem to be better condition. They, they pushed the pace higher and they beat all their opponents. I mean, they had great skillsets and great game plans, but they moved so much, so much and had so much more speed over their opponents that they just couldn't keep up. And uh, um, the athleticism, strength conditioning, that's a huge equalizer, called God's Lord say technique within strength. If you're not strong enough and physical enough to pull off a ship and you're trying to do, then it ain't gonna work, you know? And

Speaker 2:          00:28:10       that's such an important point because that's sort of denied in the Jiu Jitsu community a little bit. You know, there's a lot of people say I'm wearing it, by the way, this is no disrespect. And I got to Leo Gracie tee shirt on right now when I'm saying this and work

Speaker 4:          00:28:22       requires a lot of strength and I've trained with all the, with a lot of top, high level Jujitsu guys are legends like Henzel Gracie. I've rolled with these dudes. And even as a kid I remember hearing all the rhetoric about Jujitsu and the gentle way and all this and you know, no energy and effortless. And I'm like, fuck that. These dudes are strong as shit. They do everything with a huge amount of strength. They have a lot of technique, but the difference like the difference between like this Hen i Henzel and this is back in Abu Dhabi and this other fucking, you know, black belt champion Schmo from Brazil is that black belt Schmo from Brazil does the same move. The hanzo does, but it handles like fucking three times as strong as that dude. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       And he's going after it wrestling style as well. He's like snapping your head down and clamping down on a guillotine and yanking on it and put this mist on you and you're trying to get your hand away and you can't. I tell them I'm a lifelong of grappling strength today. No question. Perfect technique, no question, but absolutely strong given, given a,

Speaker 4:          00:29:26       an uneven playing field are given, even techniques, you know, even on the technique side of the person who is stronger and faster is going to apply it better.

Speaker 2:          00:29:34       Yeah. You know, I always had this theory about Hickson and uh, one of the theories about Hixon that I always say, if people know Hixon Gracie, it was always considered to be the greatest of the Gracie clan, just like a magician on them. Yeah. But also like weight way more built. I mean if you compare him to like, well he is raising a physical specimen, especially when he was young. I mean he was just like a perfect athlete, but if you, if you think about him when those days he got more taps in because he was stronger and he was like physically he was a freak. Like he was a great Yogi. He's like a, like a really an avid yoga practitioner that belly flexibility, strength and body control. Mind watching them go at it with people

Speaker 4:          00:30:15       go hard fast. Those clips from those Samo tournaments, he just sign onto people's limbs. I mean, there ain't nothing like smooth whatever, like just chilling out and catching an oh my friend y'all. How are y'all?

Speaker 2:          00:30:28       No, the guy's like, oh, he's like a, he's like a fucking blast beat, you know, from a death metal song. Just chewing through somebody's body. I love that a guy like that exists. I love that there's a guy that is the one guy that stands above everyone else.

Speaker 4:          00:30:43       You know what I've always heard, not to create rumors and not to say that any of the people a fore mentioned ever said as such either because, uh, you know, they've never with this guy, wouldn't you never ever, ever, ever talk shit or, or try to like, you know, run around and, and, and, you know, behind the scenes I'd be like, oh, but really he's not that kind of guy, but I've always heard that from people that have trained with both of them, that Laborio is considered even better.

Speaker 2:          00:31:14       You know what? That's a very funny thing that you said that I was going to say Laborio is the other guy that has that sort of Laborio is like the most approachable, friendliest, sweetest guy.

Speaker 4:          00:31:23       She'll do it. And laboriel even say about, he'll talk about his competition. He goes, you know, I just wasn't able to do as much in competition as I had wanted to or as I was capable of on the mats. I mean, he's not, he's a humble, straightforward, no nonsense, just a, he's not a, he's not going to bullshit about any of it. He's not going to sit back and start naming off all these excuses or whatever. He goes, ah, you know, that day I just, you know, I wasn't able to. I know, I'm like, I should have taken that guy out and like a minute. But uh, for whatever reason that it just didn't work out, maybe my head or this or whatever. I mean, he does. He's not a, he's not a, some cocky sort of dude trying to make, give himself an out to why he didn't perform as what he wanted.

Speaker 4:          00:32:04       But that's one of the reasons why I liked that guy so much because I know how good he is. I even watching them back in the day and I'd tell him, Oh man, that was a really good match. I mean, he was like, yeah, you know, it was cool. It was all right. But uh, but you know, I'd heard from all from these other Jujitsu guys, like, man laborio actually, that's the dude and people don't talk about it, but that's the guy that they think is Charles. Charles Mccarthy was the first person to told me that, but chainsaw. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:32:28       he, uh, he told me a long time ago and then I started asking around, you know, I was only like a blue belt purple belt, but I didn't really know who the great guys were. But he said the other guy that was like that with him that people don't give enough credit to, he said was travis Luder. He said, Travis Luder is a lot better than people gave him credit for. He's like, he never really got his shit together like conditioning wise and had a few.

Speaker 4:          00:32:48       Travis is tough. We all knew that. He was a pretty, pretty talented when it came to, uh, to, to his grappling skills on the mat. I mean, he very underrated. He was Terry, let's be honest. He put Anderson on his back and did what he wanted. He just moved. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:33:02       Let me tell you something. The day before travis looked like a dead man. I mean, I've. I've never seen a guy in all my years of being at the weigh ins and that's over 12 years now. More than that, if you count the nineties, he was dead dude. He shuffled to the scale for his second attempt, like literally couldn't lift his feet up. The chores were married up there. Huh? Looked horrible. I've never seen a guy who his lips were cracked and dried out like he had sucked himself dry like a sponge. He was still more than a pound over. He couldn't make it. He couldn't make the way. I don't remember what the final thing was, but he just fits right. Whatever happened, it wasn't fucked up. He wasn't a title fight and he was dominating him, but he ran out of juice.

Speaker 4:          00:33:46       I'm sure most of it was due to even because he pooped out in mountain was physical exertion and his muscles just. They didn't have enough energy to power them. They didn't have any electrolytes. You didn't have a mineral is needed to keep those things going and they just, they just gave up.

Speaker 2:          00:34:00       That one drives me crazy. There's a lot of guys that I've seen fall apart.

Speaker 4:          00:34:04       Honestly. It hadn't been so exhausted and you know, that's, that's up to look at saluter, you know what I mean? And his coaches. But yeah, I think he probably would have tapped into

Speaker 2:          00:34:15       luder luder in top form in that fight. Alluded that was not sick. Would it get in the Anderson Silva a lot of problems. I mean Anderson is a lot better on the ground and people think,

Speaker 4:          00:34:24       yes, he's very wily. Luder is so his more similar to like a another guy that people don't understand, like a Picasso who tapped Anderson from amount, amount of triangle, the uh, I think it ended up being mounted, but I started off on the back, but a part of the reason why he, I believe he tap Anderson and, and, and you can see that backstage footage from pride and Anderson is so upset about it, I think. And I know in my opinion why he's so upset that he lost, wasn't he? Because he can't believe he got caught like that is because what he didn't understand is to. Casa is one of those dudes that has freak strength, like unreal crazy, like his arm feels like a pile of steel strength when he gets a hold of you. And I rolled with the dude and the guy.

Speaker 4:          00:35:07       I'm like, Holy Shit, I can't believe how strong this guy. And I remember when Vernon, Vernon, White Russell. Then back in Abu Dhabi, it's like, man, that guy's a fricken stronger and you think he is. Then we're dudes like that, right? Yeah. He's just crazy. Fricking strong. And so I'm guessing Anderson, you know, ended up on the ground, he's like, cool, whatever. And all of a sudden it's like, holy fuck, I can't get away shit. And I think luder probably has some of that similar quality of being a lot stronger than people really understand. I always liked travis from the get because he was. He came from the, from the Jujitsu background, but everyone's like, he's a, he likes lego blocks exit and he trained at the lines and dudes and always been a nice humble dude. I've always dug travis,

Speaker 2:          00:35:44       speaking of leg locks for, for folks who don't know, for the longest time Jujitsu guys didn't go for leg locks because they thought that leg locks were who were cheating a weak way to tap a guy. And one of the, I don't know what, what, what put that in their heads because it's like a train.

Speaker 4:          00:36:01       Maybe you know why it's like, let's just be honest, they said that because they didn't train it. Um, most of the training that was coming down throughout the rest of the Jujitsu tree was not including leg lots. A lake lots are not really given a lot of precedent even if they were illegal.

Speaker 2:          00:36:15       So they just ignored what made you choose to do good in the first place was adapting.

Speaker 4:          00:36:19       Sure. And they just, they, because they weren't good at that. Instead of accepting it and being like, okay, this is a weakness, they just threw a fit about it,

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       wasn't it? Also because dudes are getting fucked up, especially like heel hooks maybe, I don't know. I mean, you don't have much time to tap how many times, especially people get their arms busted off. It's true, but he'll hook seem to be even more devastating. It seems to me that you can snap your arm back and get it repaired better than you can fuck your knee sideways

Speaker 4:          00:36:46       potentially. I think maybe the difference between, uh, the uh, vertical like type of a break versus that twisting. Like if you had an arm and you twisted it and smashed and tore up all the tendons instead of just going one direction. Maybe that's part of the problem. But also, uh, I think there's a bit of a disconnect for people between their legs and their arms. Like they don't, they, they are more aware of their arm position and how bad something is or isn't versus their legs. And then I'm sure some of that comes to the lack of training. Eric won a Pan Am games that blue belt and blue belt, purple something back in the day, way back in the day back when, you know, he probably road there in a horse and carriage. And uh, he tapped a bunch of people with leg locks and the whole crowd booed him. Isn't that crazy?

Speaker 2:          00:37:30       Ooh, why I'm bringing this up is that it changed somewhere along the line they had to give up and they all go after leg locks. I mean, it's the most, it's most hypocritical. Juarez is excellent. He's the best. He's just one of the scariest guys when it comes to leg locks because he's a fucking ridiculously strong dude and he's got good technique. So if he wraps a hold of that thing, like you're in a fucking terrible situation.

Speaker 4:          00:37:53       Yeah. He's like a, he's like a, a, like a Solomon Grundy of it may just getting in there and just trying to figure leg off.

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       And. And your, your best friend Hector Lombard went out it.

Speaker 4:          00:38:06       Oh yeah. Actually, you know who's not bad at leg locks. Hector Hector's very good at language factors. Good at actually hector's pretty good at everything. He will only choose to use a piece of his arsenal for the most part. I think that's more of a mental thing than anything else. But hector actually has a ton of tools at his disposal.

Speaker 2:          00:38:23       Yeah, we're very underrated ground game. If you watch that leg lock, there's a video of him competing, uh, one of the Nogi grappling tournaments and he slaps a straight ankle lock in this guy and breaks his leg and you hear crack, you know, and like you see that torque that he's put in with that

Speaker 4:          00:38:38       fireplug man, we were talking about muscle ups. How do you do muscle? And Hector come eight man wasn't muscle up man. I'm like, well what you do did you do like this? And he goes like this man, it also explained a muscle muscle up is you grab a pull up bar and so you go and you go through the whole pull up motion of pulling yourself chin over the bar. But once you get up to that point, you pull your body all the way over the top of the bar. So now you're, you're a, a, the bar is now at your waist and your, you've got your arms completely extended out. It's ridiculously difficult. Hard thing to do. And, and hector wasn't doing it like kicking his feet like a crazy fuck. He was just like, like George of the jungle fucking flinging himself around like this man.

Speaker 4:          00:39:21       Yeah, like that. You know, you didn't have to do 12 of them to prove it, but you got to be 12. It's something like, he just fucking popped him out and he goes, I do pull up all the time map mode, the digital, the digital. Jesus Christ got that crazy judo strength. He's got crazy. Everything is crazy. Genetics. Crazy mentality. Yeah. Well it's. When it works, it's fantastic. You know, he's an exciting guy to watch, man. That dude, he's got some fucking freak power in his hands too. He can hit. He's fast. He's very sharp. He's a, he's more of a, he's not a heavy puncher. And like that heavy flooding. He's a, he's a snapper. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:39:58       Throws his hips into things. You know. That's one thing about judo guys as well as a wrestler guys, once they learn, like especially a wrestler has got a good power double once they learn how to put that same effort and energy into a punch like you saw with Erin Simpson, Erin Simpson started putting people away, learn to spring into his punches. You know, once those guys really learn how to do that. Like Henderson, Rashad Evans, Rashad Evans has gotten ridiculous right hand.

Speaker 4:          00:40:22       Rashad has tons more, tons and tons of power. Uh, I think it's. Timing is terrible though. Yeah. He often whiffs tons of punches were I think he's throwing without thinking instead of setting up that strike that he's looking for instead, I think you don't think he's getting better at that now. I'm sure there's improvement, but I still think that that is like, he doesn't lack speed at all super fast. He doesn't lack power. Uh, I've, I remember watching the chuck flight gets going, man, he's getting tore apart in terms of timing, but chuck's hands are so down that and that, that, that right handy, that right hook. He keeps throwing his, got knockout all over, like you don't want to get touched by that. And boom, he gets beat Clemson with it and chuck goes out like a light or even he got on top of forest and he threw just a punch from down on top, but it had such snap on it. Boom, tort a forest was out from there that were shot of the chunk of Delphi. There were shot that you saw against. Um, uh, who's this last fight? Well, Jones, but I wouldn't even know in his last fight

Speaker 2:          00:41:21       are any fight. Um, Mr. Wonderful. Denise.

Speaker 4:          00:41:24       Oh he did. But even still they're like, I don't, he's still not, he's not really a timing's better, but he still like, there's so many opportunities that I think he's a, in terms of lining up good solid shots and uh, and putting his opponents away. I still don't think he has as much comfort and I'm just like, he's not as at home on his feet as a striker, still as, as perhaps as he could be. Well, he's been training with spong now, you know, those guys that done at the Blackzilians with spong and with that Henry, who's that guy, I'm sure those guys put them through pad work and all the different because they Davis Friday. I thought that was like some of his best striking one of his best fight. I just think what it comes down to is it's not even necessarily the, uh, the, the pad work he's doing or the technical work or even just the flat out sparring.

Speaker 4:          00:42:15       I think it has to be a very engineered drilling scenario to try and awakened that potential in somebody. A lot of times people they think, well, I need to get better on my feet so I'm just going to spar more and spar harder. But actually what happens is, is it's a, it's like the difference between doing shoulders and doing your rotator cuffs when you're doing your shoulders. Like every muscle group comes into play and often you know, things like the rotator cuffs, the weakest link, you're not going to really draw upon that because that's not made for shoving, you know, weight, overhead, big heavyweight. And and high stress loads, so all of this other stuff is going to compensate for your little muscles so they don't have to work nearly as hard when you've got these big movers in place, well, when you need to work your rotator cuffs, you have to use a small way on purpose because you have to try and get all this to shut down so that it doesn't come into play and you can work just those little tiny muscles that often get over overlooked and over compensated by the bigger muscle groups and that's how you work your rotator cuffs and you don't doing small weight because you're a pussy.

Speaker 4:          00:43:14       If you got to do small weight because otherwise you're not going to engage. Those muscles and other muscles are going to come in and take over, which you don't want. You're trying to work on something very specific. Same thing with standup work. You can't go out there and just go harder and go fast and go tougher. Sometimes you've got to really dial that shit way the hell back way slower and just start putting yourself in two different mindsets and start putting yourself into a position where, okay, well, what am I working on here? I'm always retreating too much. Like so maybe you cut up like a little square and you've got to stay within it and you got to move slow and light and just get used to getting hit and then rolling with the punches and you're slipping and your, your head movement and because often you know, okay, I'm going to work on my defense this round and you're going hard. You just get your head harder one direction or the other. Dip harder, swing faster, but you don't what? You don't realize that you're actually overcompensating your technique by your athleticism. Yes. And uh, what you have to do, if you really want to work your technique, you got to scale it way the fuck back. You gotta you gotta train the mind, the eyes and the body all at the same time. And it's different

Speaker 2:          00:44:20       in this approach. Your approach is one of the reasons why you're this many years in the game. Now. I said I saw you fight way back in super raw, which was in the nineties, right when, right.

Speaker 4:          00:44:31       You're going to make 99.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       Well, I started my career in like a 96, 97, but this, this approach to it, this cerebral approach did this the only way you stay this lucid but this many years in the fight game. But this is the only way, right? I mean

Speaker 4:          00:44:47       much that uh, and uh, you know, fucking people up bad so they can't really do. But uh, back at Amc we used to do a lot of flowing drills and things just weren't all about killing each other. I mean we had a lot of time killing each other to trust me there. Fuck, you have to have both. Yeah. I mean, we, we have a good balance and the problem with especially like, so I've got this reputation of not being able to keep sparring partners and all this stuff, you know, because the problem is they come in during fight training and they get fucked up and I don't go to injure anybody, but you're damn right. I beat him up.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       So are you, when you're doing flight training, are you going full clip every sparring session? Do you go 70 percent?

Speaker 4:          00:45:27       Well, usually 80 to 80 to 90

Speaker 2:          00:45:30       now. Isn't that a. it's a, it's a fascinating thing. The idea of how to correctly prepare someone for an mma fight and with you it's got to be really difficult because it's probably not a lot of dudes. You're going to take advice from that know more than you at this stage of the game. So when you're piecing together your training programs, you're piecing together your stand up and you're grappling and how do you, how do you decide like how much time you should put on this and how do you engineer it?

Speaker 4:          00:46:00       It's a balance. You have to be very honest with yourself on what's necessary and you can't just sit back and have this pride and ego step over what what is important towards developing you're training and I've got guys like Eric Paulson and there's Paulson is a walking, talking encyclopedia, fucking people up and. But he also has the tendency to just start pulling from everywhere sometimes and so he'll throw in these techniques. I'm like, Dude, one, I've never even done that in too. That's. I don't fucking really think that's applicable, but that's just how Paulson is. He'll hit you, you know, you say, all right, let's do a, let's work on some hand combos and he'll throw a thousand of them that you. And. But the thing is, is that there is tons of valuable information and tweaks. It can be made. You have to be smart enough and open enough and, and, and present enough in this type of training to work with him to develop all those skills.

Speaker 4:          00:46:52       I mean, I have all kinds of tricks that I've picked up from Paulson over the years that are. I know it wouldn't have gotten any place else because people don't have that kind of background martial background and even, uh, you know, I've got specific coaches that what I do is when I go on a train with them, I really narrow it all down and I do exactly what I'm there to do with them and then when I'm done with it, then I have to assess all the data that I got from that training session and how that's going to apply to me in the ring with my overall strategy, what works best, where my natural tendencies are, are, and under certain scenarios and just in general and uh, and how to best incorporate it. If I'll go and I'll do a training session. Often I'll have a hill.

Speaker 4:          00:47:33       My coach Nixonian will have me doing these six seven punchkick combos or involve me spinning and hook kicking and all this kind of stuff. I'm never probably going to be able to pull that off. Uh, in the ring. You know, that whole start to finish at the top of the double kicks up top boom, spend bank, come back, boom, boom, boom. Like, but there are pieces that I could take from that and use it in a combination or use a setup to something else or set up to a take down or is it counter? Uh, also just the ability to be more dexterous, more able, more agile and just have better body control and balance. Uh, yeah. That's why GSP has been doing gymnastics. It's fantastic. If I wasn't a big son of a bitch who thinks their arms just pull off, I tried to do it. Not to mention who's a deteriorated his body with years and years of training and whores and alcohol. Uh, it, maybe I would do more in gymnastics other than bedroom. Gymnastics. Yeah. My leg doesn't go there. You shouldn't try either. You can't even do rubber guard pulling any kind of ironic. Not really a

Speaker 2:          00:48:39       so don't know the, you're, you're a leg lock master. You've known for your leg locks but it needs are all fucked.

Speaker 4:          00:48:45       Oh yeah. I mean knees, ankles, all. I mean everything takes the price. But uh, um, no, I can't do rubber guard especially. I'm just not, don't have that kind of flexibility that way. And, but uh, I understand how it works, you know, I mean I can do pieces of it and I can, I can get down there with someone like Victor Webster or a, a role for any of those dudes from 10th planet and go, okay, well while you're working this, your angle is off here. You need to apply your pressure. There you this, that, you know, whatever. And you know, I'll do stuff if I'm at Eddie's just rolling with vic and those dudes. I'll throw rubber guard type shit on Vic. Best, my best approximation and sometimes I come up with some pretty clever stuff. Somebody asked me, why are all these fighters getting injured?

Speaker 2:          00:49:25       Wow. These fighters getting engine pulling out of fights. I'm like, because they're doing a sport where the whole key to the sport, the, the end game is breaking people's bodies and then the practicing it all the time. Sure. How do you intelligently approach it's. So you get through all the training but with as little injury to your body as possible. Do you engineer that or you just roll the dice? I mean,

Speaker 4:          00:49:48       I think it's a little of both. I mean, there's a lot of a factors that you just can't account for, you know, somebody, excuse me, somebody just rolls into your leg,

Speaker 2:          00:49:58       whatever. Nuts that's been coming up a lot lately. And Dana talked about it that Rashad Evans had to pull out of a fight. The actual fight where Shogun lost the title to Jon Jones shot was supposed to fight Shogun, but Diego Sanchez was wrestling with some dude and accidentally see that that's just a lot easier. That's near each other.

Speaker 4:          00:50:20       No they shouldn't. And, and one thing that I got from Japan and just always made total sense to me at, uh, at AACC A, our bay and we were going to be Fuji is Jim. The other people that aren't wrestling stand in between all the other folks and keep them from running into each other. We do that attend planet 10 flat does that happened to. And that's a, that's a nice thing if you could just come on, you got to be smart with your training. And sometimes like, hey look, look at this fighter. He is completely beat down. Wore out and, and he's, you know, yeah, you can try and get him to mentally push through all this kind of stuff, but guess what? That muscle fatigue is there and he's, he's right to be injured right now to change training. Yeah, change your training.

Speaker 2:          00:51:01       That's where intelligence comes in and that's what people don't understand about mma is that, you know, I've, I've had people like write these really stupid things that are just knee jerk reaction. Oh, these brain dead knee jerk reactions to stuff. I bet you've seen this, you've seen this amongst people, but when you really break it down in, in order to really be at a high level and compete in mma, you are managing a lot of shit mentally, emotionally, physically, and on top of that, you're trying to piece together the game with the most consequences of any other game that the game of fucking people up or getting fucked up. There's the most consequences emotionally. Most consequences physically. Anybody who thinks losing a basketball game as hard as you could go out.

Speaker 4:          00:51:49       They're in, you know, going out and as a team losing, uh, let's say the NBA championships sucks, you know what I mean, but it really is only a real motherfucker if you have the game winning shot and you were actually inside the, uh, the key and you throw it up and you blew it. Now that is way that's really painful. That flows, that's as close as you can get. That kind of thing to being a fighter and losing a major fight on national, worldwide television. That's. And even still, it has to be the championship. You have to lose the APP, that entire championship to do that. And here's the, the thing that also why it doesn't quite get to that point for, for that per, that basketball player versus the fighter because next year you get another chance to just do it all over again. And while you may have blown it and the whole city is like, fuck you, you suck, whatever, blah, blah, blah. No one kicked your ass at the. So. So now you go and you compound the fact that not only did you just do something you had at all the cards, you had all everything in front of you and this was your chance. Not only did you blow it in front of everyone, but somebody beat your ass to make you blow it. You didn't just go out there and fuck up. No, you got fucked up and you lost. You have the mental management

Speaker 2:          00:53:06       of all these different things. The physical task of actually fighting, controlling your energy, knowing how to pace yourself on top of knowing what to execute and there's so many dimensions to execution as opposed to like a standard, like a basketball game or a boxing match. The dimensions. I have so many messages, fourth dimension, like my third eye, my brown eye. When you're adding in, I mean like how many? Look, I've watched a cro cop today versus random and we were watching best of pride. I was going off on twitter, did the fucking best of pride today was insane. It was a Dan Henderson's a second fight with vandelay, which is like one of the greatest fights of all time. That was awesome. And then they showed cro cop getting knocked out by random in and I was like, man, that is where that wrestling dimension really falls into place because cro cop is so worried about that takedown that he gets clipped with a big punch right where he probably would not have gotten clip with that. It was just a standard standup. Like exactly. It just makes it all so random or engaging the fake. And then he came up with new. The kick was coming. That's when he threw the punch. There's so much intelligence and strategy and consequence and it's like it's, it's such a highly charged game that when people like say things about it, like a bunch of braindead Mongoloid is beating the shit out of each other. It's just like sand some. But it's such a silly point of view. It is. It says that it's just

Speaker 4:          00:54:27       anytime, like I read something, uh, and this, this really got to me. There was a, an article on, there's this new thing on vice called fight land. Yes. And one of the guys on there, uh, likes to interview musicians about what were their fight music b, and he interviewed some guy that's like a producer or something and the guy just essentially just spewed vitriol about how stupid fighting isn't fighting is dumb and that's what idiots do and that's what we've regressed with. That's a regression. We progress past that, you know, the uncultured and the society is unlike. That's what animals do. Animals and babies fight and I'm like, fuck you, you know, I'm sorry that you're a lopsided individual and that you actually, the physicality, the physical part of your brain and your body are basically defunct and you've thrown that away and you think that somehow that makes you a superior human being because actually what it makes you, it makes you a defect.

Speaker 4:          00:55:17       You're the kind of thing that I don't want to be out there breeding to make a better human race because you're not gunna. Because you've decided to throw away a part of it is as essential as a human being and fighting doesn't have to be angry, violent, animalistic, just to dogs and cats going at it, you know, that kind of thing. It has, it can be so much more than that and it doesn't in any physical endeavor is more than that and can be more than that. And it was just such a Shitty, narrow point of view that I thought, well, for someone who supposed to be so educated to say such a thing, like it really got under my fucking skin, like mad, like maybe

Speaker 2:          00:55:53       up on it. But I just thought it was ridiculous to say that, look, I've been in the presence of people who have called me an idiot for doing martial arts or even working out, you know, I've had like, you know, the people mock that you take care of your body and it's just a defense mechanism because they're smoking cigarettes. I didn't know they're rotting themselves away. And so there's some weird justification that there's like an intellectual argument for the finite lifespan of the human being and why. Fuck with it anyway. Why even worry about it? What do you. What do you do when you're trying to stay alive forever? What are you doing? Eating Greens and taking your vitamins. What have you taken? Steroids? What are you trying to live forever and you know that that attitude of they can't be bothered with exercise like, well, that is one of the dumbest things you're telling me. You're an intelligent person. You want me to respect your opinion. You have these cynical points of views on things, but yet you're not taking care of your meat vehicle. Right? Okay. What are you retarded?

Speaker 4:          00:56:46       The thing that holds the brain, the computer. Then all this I suppose, and intelligence and wisdom and and all of the filter that you have to do everything in the spew out. Anything that you experienced in the world exists within this. You don't just drive a car into the fucking ground and throw it away.

Speaker 2:          00:57:03       It's dumb. Yeah. If you, if your car works, take care of it. Okay. Change the oil stupid. And when you deal with people that somehow or another words, it's hilarious. That is. There's like a whole section of humanity that thinks that for some reason that they, by issuing anything physical and sweating and that they are a superior intellect, the judge, a person like yourself or anybody who's doing something physical as being an inferior intellect, you almost automatically get categorized. Oh, you are a, a, a martial artist. Oh you, you fucked up.

Speaker 4:          00:57:40       Cute on you. Must be dumb. Oh, that's great. I can't wait. I'm glad that you can push a broom better than somebody else. Now it's like no asshole. It's not. Got nothing to do with that. And while, yes, I could out broom you, but uh, and probably out fuck your wife, but probably either way be able to wrap their head around what it must've been like to be in. Like what was the biggest arena you guys played in Japan? Tokyo national outdoor stadium. Ninety $3,000. Went out there with Bob Sapp and called out Nogueira right in front of 93,000 fans in Japanese. 3,000 people. Holy Shit. Who did you fight? I didn't get to fight thing. I wish I could have. I was Bob's coach. I walked out and then I got into the center of the ring called out Nogueira after beating bombed. What's the biggest crowd that you ever had? Was it 50,000 at the Tokyo Dome when I fought a shaky Takahashi defending the king of pancreas belt for new Japan pro wrestling. Ultimate crushed too.

Speaker 2:          00:58:33       I was 55, I think it was 60,000 Andrea Rogers Centre in Toronto for the George St Pierre and Jake Shields and that was insane.

Speaker 4:          00:58:43       It's nuts and I was, I mean also to add to. I fought in front of like 50, 55,000 people. I fought on the same car where a Leo toe made his uh, his debut. So I knew that kid when we all, the only way we could converse was through Japanese because he didn't really speak English at the time and I didn't speak any Portuguese. And then that card why fought, you know, 50 in front of 50,000 plus I've fought on the same car. That whole cogan wrestled on

Speaker 2:          00:59:13       mix it up with pro wrestling as well. Right. That was a big thing in Japan, right? Like they, they would, they would mix in pro wrestling and then they would also have pro wrestlers who would fight shoots, they would fight real mma fight.

Speaker 4:          00:59:25       There was a real, um, want to try and bridge that gap again and you know, what it takes the right individual and it takes the right kind of planning. There wasn't really a good amount of planning put behind getting those wrestlers prepared to do it. They were just really, a lot of them were just shoved into these scenarios where Yakuza no, just by, they're just my Japanese, a bureaucracy. Politics as it is, like, you know, this is your shot is, is your boss or whatever. Like if he says, go do this and you really gotTa fucking do it. And that's just the way it goes.

Speaker 2:          00:59:55       If you're a big time pro wrestler to Takata and your, your boss comes out. Takotna was a huge progress for big, handsome Japanese motherfucker, right? Um, he went into MMA and he had a couple of fishy fights, like the forum with Coleman that was fishy as Coleman is a goddamn terrible actor. I love Mark Coleman. I love the hammer. He's the original. Matt Hamill. Was that he just had a birthday. Yeah, I love the fuck out of that dude. He's important due to hang out with Lundbeck. I tell him he's got amazing stories for days. He's great to work with. He's a good dude too. I hung out with him when he was the champ in Augusta, Georgia. Oh Wow. Yeah. We went to this crazy club that was like, it was, it wasn't like a house, like someone had turned the house into a club. I mean, it was a mess about, uh, you know, it was like in the nineties when he was the champ. Awesome. The godfather of ground and pound love Coleman. But his fight with Dakota was clearly fucker. And so. Okay. So here's an example.

Speaker 4:          01:00:50       Well, so, uh, uh, I find a Gnocchi bond by 2003, I think

Speaker 2:          01:00:56       it was. I don't understand what we're talking about. We're talking about fixed fights. We're talking about. There was a few fights where they had predetermined outcomes because they wanted these big Japanese Superhero dudes to, to win. And there was a couple of them that were kind of obvious.

Speaker 4:          01:01:09       So, uh, I'm fine finding this, an Okie Bombay card and Kobe stadium that was a combination card because this card was all filed, eliminate. This one was all fights and uh, I fought some shield night, defended the king of pancrase title against who is the former king of pancreas guy before me. So, uh, so it was a rematch against semi and uh, on that same card as my friend, a fellow new Japan pro wrestling at the time. And it still is Eugene anegada fought, fueled our. And here's the thing, he got pushed into that like three or four weeks out. Oh, my niece. And his attitude was just like, all right, well this, you know, I got to do it. They want them, they want me to fight him. So to make sure that this guy in the fuel basically fights on this card and they have a match where people are going to be all interested to see it because I'm another name, I'll do it.

Speaker 4:          01:01:58       And so I did my best to help him out, train him. I even paid stitch to who was there with me as my cut and quarter guy to go to wrap his hands and work on his cuts too, and I did the best I could and I cornered the Kata and you know, there wasn't all right corner to Nevada and they're just eating. He just wasn't. He Won. He's not even fighting. I mean we used to spar and wrestle and grapple and do all kinds of stuff on tour all the time. Here we are always working out together, but that's way different from training for a fight and they're trying to fight one of the absolute best guys in the world. And then on like three weeks, notice it. The a trouper man. He's a real fucking awesome dude. But he got pushed into it.

Speaker 4:          01:02:35       There's a different attitude though. They're in Japan to organize what it's called. She organized means it can't be helped. So that's basically the attitude is if you know something shit, he goes down, whatever reactor start melting down and you as this technician or just going to go in there knowing you're going to basically your community, you're going to die and you're going to go into your ship. That thing down anyways, Shogun, I can't be helped. That's hard for us to understand. Well that's why a tragedy hits Japan like that and people stand in line, don't flip out. They take care of each other, but it's beautiful. Really. It is. And that's a. That was another thing like the cultures around the world are all different in the way they operate are all different. So like when all the crazy shit that's been going on in the U, s and then people are going rampant like rabid dogs throwing out statistics from this country and that country and this country all about different things and it's like you can't really compare us to Japan or us to the UK or us. Like every. They're all different cultures and you may only can compare America to America and the way that we are. People are educated. The way that our government system works, the way that the populace is divided up in the land that they live in, the type of philosophies that they carry and the culture that drives them makes them unique to America and no place else. Yeah. It's hard to wrap your head around that. For a lot of people. They think that, you know, if we have

Speaker 2:          01:03:56       the same access to weapons as people do in other parts of the world and we'd have the same results, but that's not the case because you look at parts of Africa where we've got complete total immersion and crime, you know, like you look at Liberia and the amount of guns and violence and stuff. Like there's parts of the world that are just violent

Speaker 4:          01:04:16       that just murdering each other everyday. Just about this apparently South Africa. Even the, the, what you think of as a civilized more um, um, uh, developed parts of Africa in terms of like a society and a or like just like city and modern type infrastructure. I'm not here to, to, to declare that, you know, one way of living is better than say, you know, an aboriginal, right. Whatever, who cares? You were just talking about technology, right? So even in those, I mean there's like these people, you know, that BMW has an, an option. And I got this from a, from a South African who was telling me about this. I was down racing the Baja 1001 of these guys, uh, working with the company, a wide open was telling me about, uh, about living in South Africa and how BMW has a factory option at the dealerships. And, or I think it's a factory often, or at least it's only offered in South Africa.

Speaker 4:          01:05:09       Your bmw, you can order an antique car jacking a package and you want to hear what this antique car jacking packages. Yes. Okay. What they do is they install propane tanks into these cars and they put a set of burners along the the side trim down there and below the door, so if somebody comes and take car jack you because it is so prevalent, you hit this [inaudible] button and flames shoot out the fucking car and you char them to death. I love that. And you know what the cops do, they come rolling up in South Africa. They're like, oh, another one. Wow, I need to get that. And have you seen that? Can pull that up. Little feverish. I don't even know how true this is, but I've seen the thing rolling around on facebook and whatever about some female doctor in South Africa because rape is so such a fricking often rape content.

Speaker 4:          01:06:02       They make that insertion device with barbs in it. Yes, it does. Can you imagine living in a society where you have to wear as a woman, you have to wear a condom with spikes in it, but to protect yourself from rape? Yeah, because there's. There's that much rape going on. It's basically like the jungle. How W W as close. Closest people can get to in terms of behavior. Uh, another thing, my buddy from South Africa was telling me about his, uh, at one point. So he, he did get, so they have tricky ways of carjacking, you know, down there. So he does, he gets car jacked and he's not in his car and uh, in a way that he can hit this burners and kill these fuckers. So they carjack um, they, they run off and whatever and the cops show up and the cops chase them down and shoot these fuckers.

Speaker 4:          01:06:46       But in the midst of that, where they leave the guy, they have to leave the guy to go track down these dudes. So my friends just sitting there and they go, hey, here you go. And they just hand them a specter submachine gun a go. All right, if these guys come back around to shoot him. Whoa. So there is, here's the place. But Cole have guns. The cops just gave him a gun and told him to wipe this dude. Here's a machine gun. Hold your ground. Holy Fuck. Here's the car jacking. They, I've actually seen this before. It's crazy. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. I need to see this. God bless you. Bye.

Speaker 3:          01:07:21       Holy Fuck. Why don't they just Jackie from the back door. They have ways of trying to do. They're going to do this on somebody. Somebody get cooked. Oh my God. That's amazing. That is the coolest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. And that's what people are living in. What if you missed that switch? What if you're texting while you're driving? You hit that switch. Look at this. Okay. Hey, I'm sorry. Let me hit this switch real quick. Where you got this gun in my face. Oh No, it's not a flame thrower that I'm fighting for pain. You smell that says, wow, you need bulletproof class too.

Speaker 4:          01:08:06       They probably offer that. Can you imagine getting in a car accident? Your car just blow up. God bless you. God you to see BMW. So, so that's what I'm talking about. And that, you know, it's, it's, yeah, there's cultures and societies are radically different everywhere now. We don't necessarily need flame thrower, you know, things on our cars. I mean, there are probably, are parts of the US, Detroit potentially, I don't know, a whole lot about Detroit supposed to be the best, you know, it's supposed to be real bad, but uh, I mean that is a viable option. I mean, that could be unnecessary and it's not because I want to run around flame throwing people for freedom, although I try to do most things for freedom as long as you do it with a good country music background. And the belt buckles big something six.

Speaker 4:          01:08:49       He gets something hanging in the background. Yeah, you burn you Lug Eagle inside my heart, fire straight from Jesus, the blood guy. So, uh, I mean, but how about this, you know, think about, Oh, you're driving in your car, you've got your kids and whatever. And some asshole comes up. He wants to carjack you and let's just be honest. One send me, somebody starts pulling guns, knives, any type of weapon he wants to do harm to you, but for, for his own purposes, you have no idea what they're going to do. Oh, well he's just going to know he's not. You don't know if he's just going to steal your shit. No, you have no clue. I mean, there was a report of a these dudes and like, um, I don't know if it was Mississippi. It was, it was like a bad news ghetto area, right?

Speaker 4:          01:09:38       It was like a gnarly spot where these were folks who were living and apparently these dudes carjack some little couple and took them back, took their car, took their shit, took them back to their, to their, to the residence or wherever we're were were these, uh, these nefarious dudes or staying and then tortured and raped them and killed them. And then through their bodies in a trap and a dumpster. Okay. So it wasn't even enough to just take someone's car, their possessions and belongings, but took like this boyfriend, girlfriend and fucking mutilated them and did horrible shit to him and then kill them. And uh, you're like, well it can. That's just the thing is that you don't know what somebody who has ill intent for you is, it really has up to do. So I've had people talk to me about like, oh, what happens if he pulls a gun on you?

Speaker 4:          01:10:21       I'm like, like give them what they want, you know what I mean? I'm not trying to to bargain my life versus a bullet over a wallet with some money in it or whatever. Like that's just not that important. But I also think in my head like you have to assess a situation and it might become absolutely clear that I'm, this guy might not have any intention of letting me go. There's a lot of that in the world or you know, if someone pulls a knife on me, I'm like, I got, I hope never. And I like why I go because if someone pulls a knife on me, I'm going to murder them. If I have to. Like I'm not going to stop until he's dead because he's got a fucking knife. I don't know where his friends are. I don't know anything about what's going on. All I know is it the minutes a weapon gets pulled on my person. They intend for me to die. Whether they actually don't have the guts to go through with it or not, or maybe that just they just want my belongings. I don't know that shit. I can't read minds. I just know someone wants to cut and like kill me to my shit.

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       I think there's a real, there's a mindset that a lot of people have where if you concentrate on things like that, you could sort of manifest it and if you spend all your time worrying about people attacking you, then you know you're going to invite that shit into your life. There's a lot of people that really believe that and they also believe that, you know, really the, the evolved way to be is to just never, never get into any sort of an altercation with anybody and try to keep society as civil as possible and as many last as possible. Yeah, I see their point of view. But uh, the real problem is the randomness of life.

Speaker 4:          01:11:49       Oh, I see their point of view too, but I think it's pretty obvious where that type of concept goes. I mean, it's like killed. Well, you can get, not only can you get killed, but now all of a sudden you take away the ability to be the kind of any kind of per person than any individual that you want to be. All of a sudden you become some you can. Part of this. I'm fucked up and ran novel. We can't even use the word I anymore. You know? It's like, whoa. That's why would you want to. That's yeah, it may be peaceful, but how is that? That's a repression of of the human spirit and and like that. There's no growth in that.

Speaker 2:          01:12:23       Well, not only that, you're allowing, you're doing a shitty job of preserving your own excellent genetics by allowing some cut bag to take you out. Of course, when you intellectually, you have made a decision early in your life to prepare for something like this so that if something goes down, you're not physically completely inapt and you get to decide whether or not you get injured or not, and if somebody goes to do you bodily harm and they don't understand that you're a trained killer, boom, you survive and they don't. Whereas another person in the same situation, you could think you're smart all day, but now you're dead. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:12:55       Smart enough to fucking stop from getting your ass pummeled to death on the street. And the thing is, it could be as simple as a home dude from a nxs right? He a guy jerking off. No, no, no

Speaker 2:          01:13:08       guy. That guy died jerking off. No, he got it from Nsx in excess. He killed himself. You know, he, he died. It was auto erotic association is one of a slew. Trust me, I'm a God damn.

Speaker 4:          01:13:18       Okay. Well that may be so, but up leading up to that point, uh, he was drunk as fuck apparently. And got an altercation with somebody you've got shoved and he fell and he has head on a curb and the repercussions from that was a, he received brain damage to where he couldn't smell or taste anymore really? And it drove him nuts. Oh my God. Himself. But that was just simply falling down, hitting his head and he could hit his head on the curb like 50 times. And who knows how it could turn out, you know, it could have burned him right there and killed him or taken done. Just given them a crack and needed some stitches. It could be just a big goose egg. How long did it last forum? Like A. I think it was a permanent thing for how many years? I don't know. I don't know, but I believe it was a permanent thing, like it wasn't coming back so he couldn't taste anything. Taste or smell Jesus Christ. How would you know? Like what policies? Miles.

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       That was actually what was described to me as part of the huge issue was that he loved

Speaker 4:          01:14:16       how much you can never taste a woman ever again. Yeah. I mean that's a horrible fucking thing to think of, but that's also to show you that you know, the randomness you could fall off, you could fall from, you know, 10,000 feet in the air and you're shooting wide open balance. Break every bone in your body and live through it. I mean fuck. The human body is pretty amazing what it can go through. I mean, I should be some sort of a, um, a example of that as a fighter of 15 years and all the fucking Shit I've been through and yet I'm a walking, talking, moving capable human being still and being physically fit does help with that and all my flight training and the few accidents I've ever been in where people have hit me in, my car's a, all that training, all that sparring, all that time spent in the gym and being in those, you know, those, uh, fight or flight scenario isn't that high intensity shit. The whole world slows down to me and I'm completely cognizant, aware and capable where I know if you were a person that did not train and hone your focus and your physicality and your mental fortitude, you just fucking, you. But I don't know what happened either and they just flip out and they wouldn't be able to be cognizant or aware in that moment at all.

Speaker 2:          01:15:26       It says that he was found dead. He committed suicide apparently. Yeah, I'm, I'm wrong. I thought he was an autoerotic appreciation guy and he's really big on your, uh, on your choking and jerking off and I don't know why. That's my thing. Um, there was a. I know, I apologize to the family of Mr Hutchings. I thought he said it had been suggested, but there was no evidence that found it. Maybe it was one of those like Richard Gere Journal warrant rumor thing. Just some spreading through. Have you ever double up your ass? No. No, no, no. Jesus shutting yourself off when you jerk off with a job up here. No, I don't need to. I don't need to truck myself off while I beat off. I'm fine with regular feeding. Regular bed. It's always worked well for me. It's quite, quite satisfied. Yeah. I, I'm pretty happy with it myself. I'm a big fan. I don't, I really don't find any need to improve it. It's like when girls started putting like tongue rings in. Oh, it helps when you give him blow jobs, guess what? It doesn't really help. It's just a new thing.

Speaker 4:          01:16:19       The only thing that make it maybe in your mind, it's like, oh, she's sucking my cock with like this weird piece of jewelry. Like I had a couple girls that have had pierce pussies and like

Speaker 2:          01:16:28       on any better. No. The weird thing about the peers tongue is they're letting you know that down the sucks cock. That's like in a way. Yeah. Yeah. That's a green light. Any girl who lives in 10 years time and doesn't suck, there's a target to shoot some loads down to fuck. Awesome. Are the cereal bowl. Girls don't have stamps if they're not down to fuck. I mean if a girl does not like sex just to put a goddamn target on her lower back. Right? And if a girl doesn't like giving head, she doesn't walk around with a barbell in her mouth. Uh, yeah. That's what you're thinking about shooting loads on that thing. You know what you're doing. You dirty bitch. You know what you're trying to do. God Damn it. Don't pretend any girl who has a tongue ring. Give head is an asshole. If you're a girl, you have a ton. Or if you're a guy, if you're a guy, you don't give her head with the time you

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       think about that. If you're a guy with a tongue ring, you don't eat pussy, you can go fuck yourself. How about that silly bitch pussy anyways, you're a pretty horrible person. Signs, there's a reason why it smells bad. Okay? That's nature. Telling you to get the fuck out of there. You're not the only one is using this, this watering hole. It's a battle of loads going on inside that snatch right now. There is no way to cleanse this thing, right? This is a bad news deal. You need to get out of there. Isn't it funny that that smell? It's the smell of shit and the smell of dirty pussy, man, that's debatable. I'll tell you a yeast infection smell is just as bad or worse. Shin shit sharp and and it's like this sort of gets on your tongue is even if you don't eat it, you're just like, oh I want to fleet.

Speaker 3:          01:17:57       Whereas Shit makes you want to clean it up. You know? If you smell shit you like Jay, you smelled dirty. You don't want to clean it up, you just want it to be gone. I spray with Lysol and kick it out the door. You never gone down on a girl and you smell her dirty ass hole. Some girls, they don't use baby wipes. They wipe their ass with paper towels and shift. It's a terrible, terrible thing where you're trying to concentrate on eating pussy and you smell the asshole next door. Just stinking up the box, but you don't want to give up because her pussy doesn't smell bad. It's just a smell shit. You just want to clean her up so you know, you just, he's just take a little bit of the uh, the sheets and just kind of roll it up on top.

Speaker 3:          01:18:32       A little handover it a little palm. Actually. Blogging. By the way, this is the moment when we lost all of our female listeners. I'm sorry if you're hanging in there. God bless you. Want to turn the ship around? We're going to bring it back to here that we're talking about. The ast may stink. Alright? You want to use the Brillo pad on it instead of something proper. And here, look, I'm still down there trying to do our job. I'm trying to get to the bottom of that horrific smell. Like the. I know women get uncomfortable, but the subject I've had girls I get really mad at me for even broaching the subject line. It's like a rotten squid, like rolled in a pile of six month old. Catch it. And then by the way, I'm not talking about talking about the woman who has the.

Speaker 3:          01:19:10       I would never do that. I'm not rude. I mean I'd probably let you know you got a little issue, but I wouldn't be like really graphic. You've got to be cool about it. Like fucking fun up. Weird Shit. The best thing you can do is like, look, if there's like some sort of a bv thing going on or anything like that. Be a fucking cool dude. Please. Okay. You're fucking a girl in the ass and there's a little poop. All right, I'll tell him, don't flip out about it. Go in the shower and then get back to it and you know what? And then, you know, probably this chick's gonna be like, Oh my God. I'm like, I don't give her a hug and be like, fuck that. Who Cares? The other girl look it up. Yeah, exactly. Other girl. Brian, you rolling like you bring it across the room.

Speaker 3:          01:19:45       Yeah. You know, if you're an artist you can make a painting out of it. But even if you were talking about the subject of Stinky vaginas with a girl who's vagina doesn't sink, nobody likes desktop. They'll be like, stop. Stop. It's like you're bringing up candyman and you're saying his name twice. Somehow. Tony Todd's going to come flying out of her vagina. Look, what's that weird thing? It's everywhere. It's nature. Literally telling you to get away. Like the smell of like a yeast infection is like, it's repulsive. It's making you fully like. It literally makes you fat, doesn't then the Kurds coming out. Are you using that? How dare you? I dare.

Speaker 3:          01:20:24       Yeah. What is that? Think of that with peaches on it. How come sometimes that cheesy stuff doesn't smell bad at all. You don't even care like some. Sometimes girls just get overly Horny and they start producing yogurt. Yeah. I think it's the beginning of or the end of one. Is that what it is? Well, there's also that cream. Some girls have that creamy white stuff that they. They start, you know, some more than other than it's a, it's a fucking potent man. It's, it's a serious. It's like eating flog raw kind of a girl. I dated when I was a young girl, a day when I was a teenager would get so wet it would run down her leg. Oh yes. Like literally. Oh yeah. I mean all the way down a few of them below her knee starts bubbling and you know, yeah. It didn't even make any sense.

Speaker 3:          01:21:03       I'm like, what the fuck is going on? She would just. And it was all pussy lube, like everything will be all slippery. She was just fucking going and you know, there is a thing about, there's a problem with a, not a problem, but just one thing you have to take into account or you get the. I've had a few girls that just crazy wetness. I like to think it's all attributed to me, but I'm such A. I'm such a fucking manly stud, stead, Meister, you know, I, I've put my hands on them the way I like, kicked the cat out of the way. We're working on the bed. That's important sometimes for girls fucking throw the animals out of the room, but it can get to the point where it's so wet. You gotta you just gotTa wipe away, man. You gotta you gotta clean off and keep going because you can't feel anything.

Speaker 3:          01:21:43       It's just like girls that just goes overboard. But fortunately I have a gigantic cox so that's not an issue. Oh perfect. So it's tight. It just fucking just stretches that whole St. they should drink pedialyte so they don't, you know, dehydrated. So I was thinking to myself because I thought when I don't have a gigantic car in the interest of full disclosure, I don't want a lot of the people, but when we're going to come up to you at a show and be like, Joe, let me see how big your cock is. Like it was just when I was dating this girl. Obviously I didn't know any better. I was only like 18, 19 years old. I didn't know that everybody wasn't like that. I didn't know that one day. You know, like a lot of like young girls, they get really wet, but then you get older and you realize, oh wait a minute.

Speaker 3:          01:22:25       That was like his wet as a girl ever got ever. And they're like, oh, well that was our prime. Like her baby making prime was when she was 16, 17. Maybe she just had less hangups with women. Then it's all about the brain. Like if they don't want to come, they ain't coming. Some girls can't come right now. There's that, which is a tragedy because they, they should uh, you know, have that out. I mean, it's up to them and you've got girls will say to you, no, fuck you, you didn't, you didn't make her calm. She can come. You just can't make her kind of like, trust me. There's some, there's some girls that were technical difficulty or something, you know, you don't put it out right. But honestly, like a lot of times it's really. And you know, if she's not

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       comfortable at 100 percent, she's not where she needs to be, or even if she's not comfortable with her body enough to know how to make herself call sensitive, you know, I get in there. How you doing? Do you want me to release these medicals? Are they too tight? You want me to let you out of the basement, Joshua? It's like the Grad data in high school. I could fit so easily. Every thought, every girl you could fit. Every girl was festival when your hands were little back then you were just growing up. If I can, if I can at least karate chop. I'm a little bit and I'm good to go. Well, it's, it's funny how one girl respond to one thing. Then you try that on another girl in the fucking angry. Well, you know what I get. Okay. How about some uniformity? Here's something now I'm.

Speaker 4:          01:23:44       Maybe this would make sense or not, but. So I, I, I was in a relationship for almost eight years now. I'm super loyal, dude. Don't fuck around. Don't play around. That's my thing. When I'm in one, I'm in one, when I'm not, I'm not. And uh, I became newly single and so, uh, you know, first off I get to do at the time, at the time, do, do, do, do, do that newly single. And so, uh, first thing I'm going on, I'm trying to go out on the town every and uh, you know, people are like, oh, especially the chicks that you'd run into rob. You just have groupies everywhere. He just fucking everything all the time. We just got all porn. I go, yeah, actually, in a way, I've got tons of groupies straight men who form a barrier around me buying me all the fucking drinks I want by me all the shots wanting to feel like pushing girls out of the way. I can't get a single piece of pussy because they can't get through that wall of caulk that surrounding me. And so, uh, and, and every girl was like mine every year, lying yourself, Holy Shit. Like, you're just such a playboy. I'm like,

Speaker 4:          01:24:46       okay. So, uh, so at any point, uh, I finally start finding a few gals that are, they're down to like, they're cool. They read books, go for coffee, right? Yeah. We're chilling or we're talking about the new operating system on our, our Max Roller Ball that the dog catcher and bring it back. Absolutely. Um, and so I find some chicks that are cool and respectable. They're not assholes or whatever and we're were, all right, cool, let's, we'll fucking hang out. And all of a sudden I get, start getting all these girls and want physicality. Like, Oh yeah, held up, whacked around, smacked around, fucking thrown all over the place, Aka my ex girlfriend. And I'm like, I started to think for, I'm talking to my buddies. I'm like, is it because I'm a big physical dude now I'm a fighter. Like I don't think they're this way necessarily with everybody, like, and they want me to do shit. Never done.

Speaker 4:          01:25:39       And of course I'm more than willing to oblige. Well, you have to, but do you do judge them? Know, you know? Well, I mean every, every, every person is different and you can definitely tell the difference between ones where there's like, okay, there's some psychological fucking issues going on here and some that just, they see me as the facilitator of a, of an open fucking apparently Aka the good ones I guess. Yeah. Those are the ones that are guilt. No, no. I've had plenty of chicks that liked getting the shit ragdoll out of them, but we're awesome. SMART, normal mean. Just good people like they're red and their bedroom habits don't necessarily aren't always an indication of what somebody is as a person. That's always like one of my big issues. Why people are always being such assholes about gay people. It's like I don't give a fuck what he or her does. If they're gay at all, like how has that? That's not. They are a amalgamation of all these different things and who they fuck is only one small part of it. Yeah. It's okay.

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       It's an. It's a dumb person's argument. Either dumb or my joke is you the dumb or you secretly worried that dicks are delicious. Those are the only two reasons why you'd be upset. Well, my Dick seems to be very delicious as far as how flexible are you, John? Well, I can't rubber guard so I have to still keep finding these chicks, but I've been told by the time my dictates famous, I had been told that famous, that you're dictates famous w, w. What else did he tell you? My now where people are getting so super angry because the sound levels are not equalized.

Speaker 5:          01:27:14       Hey, what can we do to do this? There's something we can do about that, Brian, because people are constantly complaining, but they're always complaining that this out of 1 million people that listen to it, there's always going to be two people that tweet you but the sound, but apparently there are large spikes. If you have something you're always going to have, you're always going to have large spikes. It's if you have certain people like joey ideas. Where's that Josh Barnett fucking Viking Shit going on here.

Speaker 4:          01:27:37       Well, you know, here's the thing, like a and anybody that's completely cool and love something, they often don't say a fucking thing right? Anybody that wants to be a negative piece of shit like go out there and spoil it for everyone and just shit all over the world with all their negative garbage bullshit. They want to talk the most people with the least to say want to be heard them. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:27:58       So there's a little bit, but there also is a lot of. I learned a lot from the criticism that I'm not applying that with a broad brush across. I know I'm just, I'm just saying I need to qualify myself because I don't want people to think a lot. A lot of the shit that people have said to us about the show and me as a standup and me as a commentator and it means a comedian I said that are sort of twice. Um, I've learned a lot from douche bags. Like it's, it seems like you wouldn't because they're there being county, but then you got to say, well, if they even have a point, like even a tiny point, they can say something and then all you have to do is figure out what that thing is and take that away. Like if you have a fix that weakness, now they can't say shit. Sure. If they do say Shit, well then it doesn't mean anything anymore. It only means something. If you really feel like there's some merit to what they're saying,

Speaker 4:          01:28:43       some of the dumbest, just most asinine trite that gets thrown at you. It's not always easy to do, but you realize, I mean it is possible to learn in some way from all of this shit. Sometimes it isn't anything learning necessarily directly about you, but this could be by seeing what this person is doing, being on the receiving end of these things and you can look back and you can think about, well, how have I done anything remotely like that in my own life? How? How have I ever acted in such a way that is on that same level of like just shittiness this guy is doing to me? Or why is it that people or are are know exerting this kind of terrible attitude. You know, via that anonymity. I mean, there's so many things that your brain can go to where it's an opportunity for you to to expand upon who you are as a person. There is something to take from it. I'm not saying it's going to change your life, but I mean even some of the dumbest, worst shit that's ever come my way and sometimes I just get good material out of it. I just fucking started ripping on people, whatever, and it's hilarious and it's still serve me a purpose. I still got something out of it

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       and it definitely does broaden your understanding of the possibility of human behavior and you learn a lot about like why people act the way they act. And here's the big one. Haters like people who are really douchey or all failures, it's 100 percent across the board. No one who is truly brilliant at anything is a hater. They're just not. They might be a few jealous like sports.

Speaker 4:          01:30:16       They are a hater. They're not going to go out publicly and I hate her.

Speaker 2:          01:30:19       Well yeah, and I mean to be truly excellent at something, you have to be concentrating on yourself and positive shit and you can't be worrying about shooting somebody down or chipping too many down. So like you are taking the opinions, like if you're one of those guys that gets in battles with haters a lot of time online, you know, you could do it for fun if you want to, but what you're doing essentially is you're arguing with like some of the biggest failures as a human being that exists usually

Speaker 4:          01:30:42       person that's like, I mean, you know, uh, I'm gonna, I'm just gonna drop out of high school and get my ged and graduated early.

Speaker 2:          01:30:49       That person, that's if you're lucky. You know what I mean? But even if they have a job somewhere, it doesn't matter. It's like you're, you're socially unsuccessful. Like there was that guy that was, he lost his job. What's his name? Brian. You know what I'm talking about? The reddit guy, he was responsible for like someone like the most heinous, fucked up shit on reddit.com. Like yeah, like underage girls like suggested positions and like some dark shit and it was like really rude online. Well they found out his name, they went out and they got them and they contacted his employer and then they got the guy fired and then he was on some television show, sort of defending it saying this is a character that he plays online and that it gives them freedom or it's

Speaker 4:          01:31:28       too far. It's bullshit. Like you know what, I don't care if it's a character you even when you're just reading a bunch of texts, like you can't tell who's a fucking character or not and, and there's no way to interpret that when Andy Kaufman goes on stage and no matter what crazy shit he was doing, he wasn't out there trying to, to really fuck up people's lives. Like you maybe you show up at a show and he sings, you know, a cartoon theme songs or actually he just lip syncs. So the whole time, okay, you're mad. You may as you spent your money to go see it, but he didn't ruin your fucking

Speaker 6:          01:31:59       life. He didn't cause you some sort of a difficulty. He didn't do something and it's like, Fuck Dude, what? That, you know, he didn't impact you in such a negative way that made you want to kill them. And there's there, there used to be a, uh, an mma for them. The same thing that fight sport. Oh yeah. I remember that. They would just, everything was just nothing but negativity, negativity, negativity, just horrible as shit. There'd be people at portraying or maybe for real, like a racist personalities. There'd be people digging up stuff on other and just all of it was just to be nothing but to be horrible to each other and the other fighters and people. And I'm like, fuck, you know, why? Why live your life that way? Why spend all that energy? And truly at the end of the day you haven't gotten anywhere like you, you've just been swimming in place.

Speaker 6:          01:32:42       You haven't improved your life. You haven't gotten any further along and trying to accomplish something for yourself at all. Well, most of them are 12, you know, sad, sad, part of some of those are 30 to 20. Maybe even 50 and this guy who got caught, the reddit guy who was a guy who had children. See why, why would you, why spend? Because there's, there's clearly, clearly there's something lacking in his life, uh, socially somehow that he never came to grips with and he's using this anonymity to do this and it's just that they have a voice that didn't exist in the past and in the past they were the person that, you know, when they would be dealt with socially, like in a one on one situation, if they ever said anything, anything remotely route, everybody will be like, fuck you stupid. Look at you.

Speaker 6:          01:33:28       You'd dump fat. Fuck. And they'd be shot down. It will be over, but they can lash out at you without any fields of social repercussions. Just brought something really that really just went off in my head. All right, Joe Comedian. Yes sir. Comedians throw out heinous shit sometimes you know, but jokes are jokes are jokes and you fucking, you, you, you, you throw as you give out as much as you got. But that's the only way that you can throw out as much as you got, you know, in terms of being a comedian and pushing boundaries and saying crazy shit sometimes whatever is because you will need to take as much as you get. And that's the difference there. Like, don't go out there and say some rude shit even if you're trying, even if you're doing the right thing to go out and stand up and say something that is against somebody else or some other groups are because even if it's the wrong thing that they're doing and you need to stand up as some sort of a, uh, um, avatar against it because it's the wrong fucking thing.

Speaker 6:          01:34:24       It's not good to do. That means you have to be willing to accept every negative thing that's going to come with that and be okay with that. And be like, you know, to do, to go out there and stand up for the right thing. Something shitty might come my way. But this is something that must be done. And even if in a social scenario of your, oh, I'm going to where everyone's a pot shouting each other, you know, and, and, and it's, it's fun, but to say something, you know, to insult somebody else, even in a fun and adjust way, you can't do it if you can't fucking take it because we've all known those people were all fucking around, were saying horrible shit to each other and somebody chimes in and, and, and, and that's what's funny is there's always a change in tone when that guy does it from everybody's response to them because you can, it's like you can feel the shit that they're saying and not being able to take it. And the place they're coming from, it's like, it, it could come out their mouth the same, but there's a different energy and if you turn to them and then you're like, fuck you, you piece of shit, shut the fuck up. And it changes. It's like, it's different between you and me riffing on it.

Speaker 2:          01:35:21       Sure. He's serious. And it was just joking around with everybody else as long as he was involved in the joking.

Speaker 6:          01:35:26       But we realized, but it's like you, you can read, you can you realize that when they throw out that thing, they can't take it either and so they shouldn't really be participating because there just isn't, isn't in the same vein.

Speaker 2:          01:35:38       Well, that's what the thing about being able to hate on someone, especially a public person, like a Josh Barnett type character, which is your apparently wonderful to do your anonymous because if you're just some anonymous person, you have no repercussions whatsoever. You know so much about you. They know what your look like. They know the fights you've had. Like I was watching some battle on twitter or whatever the fuck it was. I was reading on an mma site was Josh Thompson was arguing with this guy and the guy who was bringing up like me and my friends, we laughed out loud watching you get Kayo by Eve's Edwards, please fight again so we can laugh again and you get knocked out. And I'm, and I'm why I'm like this. This piece of shit like that is the weakest and move of as a human being to go after what you know her to guy. Well, you know, it was a devastating loss. The goal to go after that when you're just, when you haven't done anything yourself, someone that put it out there.

Speaker 6:          01:36:30       Yeah, they expose themselves to all the glory and all the. All the sadness and difficulty of defeat. He went and dared to do it and you don't dare to do anything besides sit behind an anonymous thing and and and really accomplished nothing and try to take shots at somebody who went out there and tried who were not there. Try went to excel and put himself in a position where it's precarious and it's difficult and there's no guarantees and he knew that and he knew that everyone would watch it and he and you also know as a fire, you go out there and you lose. You're opening yourself up to all of that for people to come out there and use that as a weapon against you because of their shitty a personality. Yeah, exactly. And so to, to do that, it's fucking, we of course don't argue with them because they, no one's paying attention to what the fuck they have to say anyway. So when you respond, you give them exactly what they're looking for. Now.

Speaker 2:          01:37:19       Important. Yeah. And you know, I, I also think that this is not gonna last. I think this is an error in humanity that we're going to figure out. And I think it's already been too long. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:37:28       kind of. I don't. I don't know when it's gonna end, if it does end

Speaker 2:          01:37:31       well it sort of already has with this reddit guy. I mean it's, it's, they can track you down, they can find out who the fuck you are. If somebody is decently motivated, you know, for guys like you or I or Brian, you know, you, you, you're, you're, you get a certain amount of access to us. You know, you're on twitter, you're on facebook, you know, people can write threads on the underground, you're going to read them, you know, there's, there's a certain amount of access and the Brian

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       though they should be. Oh yeah, absolutely. Definitely. No, no.

Speaker 2:          01:37:59       Come on, there's a certain amount of, I mean you're, you're, you're gonna, you're used to it and you can deal with it, but when it comes on them, when all of a sudden their real name is exposed and their employer is like, all the sudden it's like whoa. Then they realize like, look, you're, you're in an ever changing game. Okay, and this anonymity that might've enjoyed two years ago really doesn't exist anymore and guess what? In a year from now and be able to read your thoughts. Okay, so keep it together,

Speaker 6:          01:38:24       keep it together and taking all this stuff from onnit Dotcom that may even come sooner

Speaker 2:          01:38:30       to be a better person. You fuckhead and that's what people don't understand.

Speaker 6:          01:38:34       They aren't trying to be better people and that is what's killing this country as it is people, the human race period, the human race period and it. But it varies from place and I think here in America we have a very specific case. Like I'm saying that it, it's, it's, it is specific to us as Americans have the way we use our technology, the way that we are progressing or regressing as individuals. And uh, there's, there's this huge concept of uh, so, so one thing about people talking shit about folks is that, you know, of course that is the anonymity, but there's also this prevalent attitude that I can go out there and be as much of an asshole as I want because you're not going to do anything about it. You can't beat me up. You can't just fight me like nobody. Like nobody actually thinks that anything will happen.

Speaker 6:          01:39:16       But oh well I'll sue you. You should be able to you. If someone talks shit to you and your a problem and may fire, you should at least be able to bitch slap them a little bit. Totally legal. And, and my thing is like, even if, uh, if you're being outwardly with so many people lack common courtesy anymore, just the smallest things. And if you do something that is discourteous in a public manner and you upset somebody, well most people just fucking take it. But if someone goes, hey, fuck you for doing x, Y, Z, that's not cool. Instead of someone being like, all right, either a, I'm sorry, you're right. That was fucked up. I shouldn't have done that. And you know, waking up a or b being like, you know what, fuck you, I'm just an asshole. So let's fight and dealing with it.

Speaker 6:          01:39:57       And then let's say they get their ass beat and then they go about their way. No, no, no. It's always like, they just keep pushing that barrier because that boundary. But, and crossing that line because they think you can do anything about it. You can't just, you know, use freedom of speech. I can be as much of a dickhead as I want, as long as they don't do anything to you. And it's okay. Fine. And I've, I've had, usually it is these things where I've had, where it's happened to me, I've turned to him and I, you know, I tell them like in a movie theater, you know, fucking cell phone and the on the, on the cell phone talking on it in the middle of the movie theater, I had to turn around. I go, are you fucking on your phone in the middle of a movie? Fucking kidding me.

Speaker 6:          01:40:30       And I looked at him and go get off that fucking phone right now I'm a breaker and a half and shove it up your ass. And I say that because I slept. Someone would say in a movie, well there's that. But also it's very appropriate. It's very clinical. When I, I tried, I pride myself on being. If I say some shit like that after I've said it during no turning back. And if I say I'm going to do it, I'm going to fucking do it because otherwise my word is meaningless. But you really shove it up their ass. You might shove it up there. I would break them a little, like a bad baby. Throw them across the chair, maybe. I Dunno, but yeah, I just went limp though. You probably just scream and pick them up and shake them them. Yeah, if they just went lamp, they just completely fetal position. I'd take that phone, break it, slam it on the phone, tell him what a piece of shit they were and they let it go. But that's your move folks. Listen, you got to go limp. Just go limp. And if you can start crying, just crying. I go limp all the time. It's that after I'm done. Oh happens buddy.

Speaker 2:          01:41:30       I think this is a very important subject and I love that you brought it up and I think um, this is a, um, a, a really important subject for the young men, especially of this era that are growing up now. Just being forced fed video games and not having any character

Speaker 6:          01:41:47       to build it. They just leave the kid with the eye, the portable portable gaming system. And you know what? I Love Games. I gained a lot when I was a kid and I loved it. But guess what? When I'm out with my parents or I'm at family functions, when I'm not sitting in a corner completely buried into some electronics the whole time being like, fuck that. Like you can't let your kid do that shit. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:42:08       definitely doesn't teach them. That doesn't raise a good human skills, but the mind what what concerns me is the lack of character building things. If you're not involved in some kind of athletics, then to me if you're. It's either that or some other difficult intellectual pursuit, but there's something that has to happen.

Speaker 6:          01:42:28       They need to suffer being being, being made to, to have some, you know, a push. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:42:33       To be able to realize that you will fail and learn from the failures. Objective. Lee, one of the most important things you could ever learn as a man is how you fucked up and how not to fuck up again because you understand the pain of fucking up. One of the saddest thing to it too, and one of the saddest things is when you see rich kids, kids that grow up with no character and no one ever tells them what to do with fucking up. Yeah, they got to cook all their life. That takes.

Speaker 6:          01:42:57       Here's the other one. They don't understand that the reason that they're able to create a business doing this or do that or have all this little successful shit running around them is because they had all the facilities to do it in the first place. They didn't have to strive and struggle and fucking, you know, oh, you fuck up. I've got money to cover that fuck up. Oh, dummies. Who were proud of that

Speaker 2:          01:43:15       be from America. Like they did something to one to one thing. We proud to be from America because we have an agreement that we're America and we're not conscious. We all get together and we fucking strive. We try to make the best shit and be proud of that, but to make it seem like you're great because you're American when you were just fucking born in a lucky spot, like that's ridiculous.

Speaker 6:          01:43:35       That's fucking bullshit. It's not your country. Yeah, exactly. You if you're lucky enough to be born anywhere you're at, you should be proud of of where you're at, but part of being, having pride in that is by being a fucking good example of a human being and representing that culture to its fullest. That's it. Not being proud

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       that you're from a fucking city. Stupid. No, that's ridiculous. Be Proud. Be Proud of your own personal control over your character

Speaker 6:          01:43:58       and your contribution to hew to your community. Your community is to be a fucking involve yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:44:06       That's the big problem is, you know I've said this over and over again, is that the biggest resource in the world, his children, children will become the adults of the future obviously, and the more access to information and character building exercises and the more we can make them great, the better off the future's going to be for everybody of course, but that's the most neglected aspect of this world.

Speaker 6:          01:44:28       Exactly. I mean, how many people are just out there popping kids out? They don't have the education or the money to support. I mean, they don't even, to me, I look at it is they don't understand how difficult and how important raising a child.

Speaker 2:          01:44:43       There's also a disconnect in what we call culture. There's a disconnect in a society because the society started out where everybody had to stick together because you go on a hunting parties and you know, you'd be growing food or taking care of babies and they were to be collective collection collectives where, uh, you know, everybody would pile in their food. Everybody had to stay alive. Everybody had to do their own job. Everybody knew everybody encountered on everybody. But it got to a point where there wasn't 50 people anymore. Now, now you have walls and now there's a thousand, now there's 2000. Now you don't even know these fucking people. So that, that this disconnect is in place where you have all these people that are supposed to be like your comrades and your brothers and sisters, but you don't even fucking know them. You know? And then it get. That's when you get to a city and that's when you get to a country. And that's where America is. It's this weird

Speaker 6:          01:45:26       then now look at the way that technology has influenced our disconnect from each other. You're buried in your phone everyday of every, of every second of every hour. These people, you're not talking to anybody in line and you're not actually conversing with the people that provide the services that you, that you're supposed to go to in life. Like the postman, the, the person with the supermarket. You're not converting. You're just like, hey, swipe card. Do whatever you got back. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:45:47       ironically, it's also connecting countries, Internet connects countries and disconnects people.

Speaker 6:          01:45:53       It does. The thing is is that the internet can be used for so much good and it can also be a crutch to turn you into a shitty completely non community based. You think that you're getting the same thing by being on facebook or twitter and all this and that. All of sudden that you're interacting with people, you are interacting with people, but that is not the way humanity works. In fact, I was reading a thing about how being a misanthrope like deliberately not interacting with society on a regular basis can be worse than being an alcoholic for your, for your body and your health. Like just simply not interacting with other people. Yeah, it makes sense. I mean it's just, you're, you're dwelling on it

Speaker 2:          01:46:30       negative energy and you're not getting any positive warm from humans, which is like one of the most satisfying things a person can get as well. Like

Speaker 6:          01:46:37       love from other people. Yeah. You see somebody write something nice to you online, all that. That's cool. If you have an a one on one conversation, look somebody in the eye and they say, you know what, I really respect you for the person that you and I, I, I'm really proud to know you. That as a way different effect on some. Same as like people want to send text messages about important as shit. Like oh, sorry about this. Oh, and you know, dog eat whatever or something. Or a are like, oh, did you hear that a so and so. It just died like, fuck, give me at least a phone call. Like a text is not. I mean, well that's a cheap way out. It is a cheap way because you really, you're, it's like, oh, I want to break up with you with even a phone call or do anything show up and somebody wants to break up with you and sends you a text message.

Speaker 6:          01:47:21       You Got off light. I guess. So I want to talk to you. I've gotten a phone call break up. Oh yeah. That was actually, that one was, that was, that was, that was really fucked up. I'm like, oh man. Well it was to me also because I'm like, aren't you? Weren't you? Weren't we supposed to be like best friends before all this shit together, Josh? Pardon? Shitty. God. Can't even look me in the face and be like, Hey, what's up? It's over. Bitch. Can't fuck me. No Mall is heading in that direction. And you stay right there. My own boat and a bonanza. This vagina right out.

Speaker 2:          01:47:52       Yeah. It's, um, the, the lack of development of, uh, of human beings like where they're tested and where they have to develop character that's like one of the big, like one of the most disappointing aspects of our society and our culture is that we've never figured out a way to cultivate people correctly that way we can do it. That's the question. We have plenty of money and plenty of resources to do things.

Speaker 6:          01:48:19       It's, and it can just start from the smallest thing in the house with chores to, to just, you know, just being stern in your word and, and leading by example. I mean the opportunity to give children those things to help develop them, male or female, you know, exist every single day and they're completely at our fingertips. If we want to choose to participate and taking that kind of responsibility for bringing this child into the world and trying to raise them to be a, uh, an awesome human being, an uh, uh, contributing important part of society and helping show by example what a good person is. You know, the drop that starts the ripples. That's super important.

Speaker 2:          01:48:57       Well it is and some people, they obviously they take on that task when they're just trying to get some pussy, let people, all of a sudden they're there, they're there in this situation and they try to make due and they fuck up and they, you know, they really don't have their own shit together. But I think as a society what we got, there's a real problem in that we, we haven't really addressed how to properly, properly make use of our, our young people. I think it's beautiful to have freedom. It's beautiful to have the ability to choose whatever occupation you want and speed. But I think that like the steps that you go from being a young man, living with your parents to being in college, to being independent there, they're so obscure and massive. It's so like, am I really am out of. Am I out here now? Okay, now I've got to get an apartment and what do I do now? While you've got to make sure you got a good job, but a good. Okay, I'm good. You could do that. How do you get the good? Yeah, right. Go to college, you go to college, you

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       spend on it. It's like actually, you know, I mean there's still this huge myth that you need to go get a four year degree in dollar ship will, you know, not every four year degree is actually worth the fucking $50,000. You just put yourself in debt. Like sometimes you're actually doing a disservice to yourself and putting yourself behind the. You can be just another college graduate, work in a fucking shit job that can't, can barely pay off their loans. You got to realize what, what is it, where is it worth putting that money towards? You know what I tell people all the time that are just sort of, you know, unsettled, whatever. Even, you know, parents are kids, you know, we're thinking about moving them along in the next step. They're graduating to go sending a fuck, you know, figure out, get a, you know, he probably isn't.

Speaker 4:          01:50:26       He or she isn't going to really know what they want to do yet. Likely. But if they have an idea, find the, find the, uh, the university or whatever school that at some point they're going to need to be at and then find the appropriate junior community college that, that transfer as well into that fucking dude and the dude that because you need to get in there and get your shit done. Books, education. I mean, if you really want to be true about it, you don't have to go to college to learn anything. You can fucking read a book. You can teach yourself and even with like the Internet like you're talking about, there is so much information and knowledge out there that a person can process. Now of course, having one on, well you don't ever get that necessarily, but having human interaction to help guide you upon this with their own experience is invaluable. But the actual knowledge of the APP, the actual process of just gathering knowledge and getting understandings that, fuck man, you think you could become a lawyer by going to a library.

Speaker 2:          01:51:22       The actual process of gathering knowledge for sure is, uh, you know, it's much easier now than it's ever been before. The real problem is that people don't have good guidelines as far as behavior, as far as getting things done, and as far as positive thinking, yes. One of the things that has been a side effect of this podcast are completely unintended and we never saw it coming. Was that all these fucking people are. I meet them after shows. He changed my life. I lost 100 pounds. I drink Kale shakes every morning. I work out everyday. I started Jujitsu. It's like thousands of fucking people. It's like, and what they say is that almost to a man, it's like I never had anybody around me that was talking the right way is that it wasn't me. It's not that I didn't have potential. It's not that I have no, but nobody that motivated me and then all of a sudden someone did and now what are you doing? Are you sleeping over there? Dude, it's not me. Is that you're snoring? No. You sleeping. Sleeping. No. That wasn't you.

Speaker 4:          01:52:24       I think there's not enough. It wasn't. You know somebody who is breathing and it doesn't like

Speaker 2:          01:52:29       it wasn't him. Oh my God, he was sleep.

Speaker 4:          01:52:33       I swear to God. That sounds really familiar to a lot of women. I've called. Is that what you do? It's, it's my opening. Tell you what you're wearing.

Speaker 6:          01:52:46       If you like that. If you go, Hey, what are you wearing? Crazy bitch. Then they tell you a dirty whore bars. Yeah, well, you know, we all have our preferences. That's when they get kicked, punched her with you. Get it. You know what? It's just like I said, you, you wanna. Do you want people to be a certain way? You want to make a difference in the world? Start with yourself and it goes from there.

Speaker 2:          01:53:08       We'll start with you. So lead. Give an example that other people can follow. Just like the examples that you followed. I mean everybody is where they are because they learn for someone greater than them. Almost everybody to a person. Learn from somebody.

Speaker 6:          01:53:19       When I have some of the men that have been formative in developing who I am as a man in life, and I tell people some of the stories that came to, you know, to, to have these people in my life and some, and there's some folks, especially a lot of these, these, these men nowadays that are, and I'm not even to speak about women because women and men are, they have totally different mindsets in the way that they develop. And uh, you can, they're apples and oranges, but the men, you, the men and women, a different dude. Oh my God, man from Mars were women. I know I'm from Mars. Are they from Uranus as a save a warrior, you know, as the god of war and death and blood and fire and all that. She just needed a hug. Yeah, in a handy, but a start from there, uh, these, these men will look at me that way.

Speaker 6:          01:54:07       Underdeveloped in terms of trying to, to, to have that well rounded understanding of, of, of being a man. You know, I haven't the all the, all the facets covered and I'll tell him these stories about some of the people that, that are major to making me the man I am and they're like, like their eyes get huge dinner place and they can't believe that they're like, that sounds terrible. That's fucking horrible. That's how like, you know what's not actually that bad. All right. You know, and I'm wouldn't change any of it because it made me the kind of person that I am the day and I like who I am and, and some of these people were hard as fuck. There's been some people in the past that were hard as fuck that farmer Burns' character who used to hang himself. Oh yeah. By his own hang himself from his neck and just stand there.

Speaker 2:          01:54:54       People Watch this guy used to drop. He didn't just use to hang himself. He used to drop like, I don't know how. I don't know how many feet it was. I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't just let me put this around. Okay, I'm ready. Go. No, he would drop and catch yourself with his fucking neck. And neck, giant neck,

Speaker 6:          01:55:11       these guys used to wrestle a back in the day doing all the catches, catch can stuff or just any type of wrestling and have nice, wonderful spongy mats. And if you did have any sort of matte substance that you could use a, it was probably someplace that was quite affluent so you know what they wrestling on ground grass, rug, carpet type shit, you know, I mean that's a snake pit in, in England. They used to wrestle on a carpet throwing each other. Jesus, Jesus Christ. But that was it.

Speaker 2:          01:55:41       Pick out a famous catch. There's a, there's a couple different schools of submission style, a grappling and one of the earliest ones in America, the called catch wrestling or catch as catch can. And um, it was, it was real professional wrestling at one point in time, unlike theatrical professional wrestling, which is like entertainment. They used to, they used to go out and then you can pin a guy or you can submit them. It could be, it could be either one. And there's a lot of gangster fucking holds that I learned from Sylvia Momenta who was a black belt in a gene labell oh yeah. Gina Bell loves all that Shit. So sylvio, uh, he was always like pig and all these crazy net cranks and all, all these different things that like, I'm like, why aren't these in Jujitsu? Cause. But they are. Some guys use them. Do you see, did you see Damien Maia has victory over Rick Story?

Speaker 6:          01:56:31       Uh, no I didn't.

Speaker 2:          01:56:32       He submitted them in the first round, but he got his back. He couldn't get a rear naked and so he turned it into a net cranking. Sure.

Speaker 6:          01:56:38       Fuck the shit out of luck. Yeah. Oh, it was a terrible angle. Like it was like instant tap ones. Like your head's gonna fly off. Sure enough, I mean wrestling is wrestling match and, and it's all over the world and people are styles that have developed, you know, Jujitsu is the way it is for the most part because of the rules of the sport, of Jujitsu. Because you know, often sport will predicate how your training will be developed because you want to be the best within this confinement. Uh, but that doesn't, that's not to say that you can't expand upon anything with the human body. If you want to be a dynamic, be as dynamic as you want to, you know, the jkd Bruce Lee's philosophy, eat the meat and spit out the bone. I mean, there's no reason anybody can't do that for themselves. But you know, what's his name? Um, Shannon, who's the dude? Jake Shannon, Shannon. Shannon is a, a great historian when it comes to just the traps. Awesome dude all around me when it comes to, uh, you know, even political stuff and cultural stuff and he's a brilliant dude and uh, the shit that he puts out there in the world as a whole, not just the catch stuff is amazing shit. Yeah, I agree. He's a really good dude. Great. Historically

Speaker 2:          01:57:40       he really loves like the history of catch wrestling and because of him and he's put out books and dvds and shit, but some of the photos that he's found, it's amazing like the techniques that they had that they were using, like triangles that were using, they were using half guard. They're using the lockdown from half guard. There were sweeping guys with these positions. Are we using all these different good teams arm in game. The first

Speaker 6:          01:58:02       time I saw the lockdown Sushi Osaka was doing it to us in an AMC back in the day and he used it as the submission version. So you get lined up on a half guard, you'd throw the lockdown on and you would extend and you basically you're putting like a calf crank on somebody. And so that's how I first, this was back in like 2001 if you count sideways on it, it's like a heel hook too. So that's how I learned it as like a, like a tricky little submission and close Daca was full of them, you know, tk. Yeah. And so that's what I first found out about lockdown. And then, um, and then I saw Eddie, you know, he came across and he used it as a, as a positional to keep him for, for using his bottom game in terms of his reverses reversals and setting up, you know, isolating that leg to use it later into different applications.

Speaker 6:          01:58:50       But it just goes to show you, you can do fucking things a million ways. And then I remember Billy Robinson, who is from the snake pit, uh, in England where that whole term, like those, uh, he's a billy Robinson, uh, is a, uh, he's from Wigan and in Wigan, that's what they came up with. The term catches catch, can get it any way you can. And uh, billy, uh, which I also refer to my love life. Um, then, uh, they had, uh, the snake pit over there and billy Riley started this place and just only the toughest of the tough, these fucking coal miners, these, these gnarly dudes wrestling on hardwood. Well, here's another sport that they used to do over there called [inaudible]. And what they would do is they would, yeah, it doesn't. Yeah. It doesn't involve kitty cats, unfortunately. What it involves is them putting on, they have these boots with studs on them on the bottom and it would kick each other in the shin.

Speaker 6:          01:59:38       Oh, get the fuck out of here. Not just like freeform, but back and forth. I go. You go until somebody quit? Yes. How big of the spikes. Okay. I don't know too big. Obviously. It's always too big. It's just like this. Is there any photos of this shit? I believe so. Go ahead and look it up. But a Peri Peri P, P U R R A, P U R R I n g I believe. Hurrying violence taking shins. England. Uh, so anyways, just with England, was it? There was no policy over there. I'm just exhausted that opportunity and know snort and too much coal, I guess makes you want to kick each other in the shins, but we're not so polite today. Sure enough. Yeah. Uh, but uh, uh, the only time I remember being in a town with the UFC were over in England and the only time I remember where, or the fighters were out trying to go grab shit to eat and do whatever.

Speaker 6:          02:00:26       And people are constantly like, Hey, fuck, you might want to fucking go like, Whoa, dude, are you kidding me? It was just London. Yes. Just over nothing. Yeah. Wow. Thank you. Looking at me funny. We'll fucking knock you out. Right? Well some improper proper go out and looking for that shit. Sure enough. But I just remember people coming back to the hotel over and over again, be like, Jesus Christ, man. Everyone's trying to like the hardest shit trying to fight everyone. Was this the uh, Tito Ortiz, Lee Marie days. Oh yes. So this was actually before mma had really made its way to Ingraham and isn't that interesting? They didn't really give a shit like who any of these, you know, American blocks where they want to fight them. But it's funny, there's a before and I'm a keen there because now that mma is there, the attitude is kind of different.

Speaker 6:          02:01:09       Still. Plenty of Brits, they'll just want to slug you up. But uh, so, so these guys, you know, these cats, wrestlers, you know, they're going out there. And so billy Robinson who trained at the snake pit, he's a catch wrestler. And an amateur wrestler and I remember, uh, he's doing a little seminar out in Santa Monica and he's showing this dropdown, sort of this, this leg hook, single leg, and it turned, you know, you drop to a hip and then you come back up. And I'm like, just so you know, billy right now, there's this Jujitsu guy called Marcello Garcia and that's like his number one into everything he fucking does right now. And not crazy. Even though you've never trained Jujitsu, you've never seen Marcello and trust me, billy Robinson had never seen or heard of Marcello Garcia.

Speaker 2:          02:01:50       It's just moves. Yeah. Well Marcello's technique is fairly basic. It's just that he had hit it so well, like the arm drag to the back. It was pretty, pretty standard the way he did it with. So is this, it is this powering. Oh my God, a very good photos. Is this real? These motherfuckers still do this shit. I don't see any spikes. Did they give up on the spikes? Oh No, they have spikes around their ankles.

Speaker 6:          02:02:14       Do you see? I'm talking about she's. When there's not enough vagina around, you start doing really stupid shit. It. Trust me. I grew up in Boston. I know what's up. So, uh, oh, there we go.

Speaker 2:          02:02:26       So, uh, this guy grew up doing that as well when they weren't.

Speaker 6:          02:02:29       I don't think Billy Robinson was doing any permanent. I think it was smarter than that, but it's just the fact that, you know, moves are moves and you know, he's showing something from one angle and it's like, by the way, you know, there's a guy doing that right now and he's winning a world title.

Speaker 2:          02:02:42       I think it was really interesting when the Shin Kicking Championships, Jesus Christ, this is state, this is pussy shit. They're putting hay. They're packing their shins with, hey, this is fake. Fake. These frauds, frauds take these frauds away. Um, it was really interesting in mma when soccer Robert came along because there was this one style of submissions that everybody was sort of gravitating towards are a lot of people gravitate towards, which is Brazilian Jujitsu. And then there's this Japanese dude who had this really kind of Funky, different sort of style, did like similar techniques but kinda had his own little flair to it. And it turned out he had actually been trained in catch wrestling that he was a robinson. Yeah, that's an amazing story. The Sakharova for people weren't really fans of MMA. They'll never going to appreciate how, what a bad motherfucker Kazoo. She soccer.

Speaker 6:          02:03:32       Let me tell you some Sakharova shit about, you know, I know how bad ass he is. You know, how bad ass he is a lot. There are plenty of, uh, of serious mma fans that know how legit Sakharova was and how much of a, uh, of a, of like a, just a character got like a sprung fucking cat on the ground. Like just able to, to, to bound the, to any positioning and come get his stuff, you know, uh, back in the day when he was going through the system and at the UWF during the shoot style progressing stuff where they would sometimes mixing shoots and works on the same deal. And a shoot for folks who don't know what it means really full on fight, but these were all predetermined bright and these are all under professional wrestling rules. They had this last point thing with the rope escapes and getting suplex and knocked down and whatever. But uh, you know, back in the day, not only did a Toccata used to beat them up because Takata used to be a legit, like fucking. I had a hellacious kick. He was a good athlete and he could fight. But tamra used to abuse the Shit Outta Sakharova all the time. There was a few times where they'd go, they'd the ring in professional wrestling. They would go legit and fucking Tamar would own him. Like Tamra was the man.

Speaker 3:          02:04:43       So what happened? How did Sakharova he graduated, man, he grew up. He got better. Yeah, of course. And fight the first UFC in Japan when he fought Kona. So Vera and they, uh, they stopped prematurely and he was like, what the fuck? And so they started a back up again later on, later on that night, they didn't fight again. It was craziness. It was like, boy, just the emotional rollercoaster. They must've been under. He didn't just beat him. He went out and tapped him tap conan. So Vera, which had never been done before. No one had seen a Brazilian jujitsu black belt get tapped yet. It was like the new thing. I was like maybe, maybe someone had, I think maybe I'm John Lewis and uh, Andre Pinera, I think maybe pet nera said tap John Lewis. Did he tap him? Did he know he didn't tap me soccer. Kicked him. Oh, did Sata was on his back and Eris like slapped why his right leg and came around with his left and soccer kicked them while Sato is an open garden. Was so was. Who was the first place in Japan to black belt to get tapped? Because it might've been, it might've been. It was like, it was like, it was the most high profile one, that's for sure. Well then, uh, was that, that was before Maurice Fought Conan? No, after, after. Yeah. Maurice had already known that going in and out,

Speaker 6:          02:05:49       but you know, a key box or knocking somebody out that's, you know, kind of a given. But the idea of a Jujitsu guy lose, especially to a non Jujitsu fighter. Yeah, no, they know what the contributor. And I used to get that all the time at AMC and people would be like introducing folks, what's your belt? Uh, I don't have a belt. Oh, what do you do for grappling? And I'm like, well, you know, we train here, we do catch wrestling with, do they? Oh, okay, okay. And then we'd roll on it, fucking annihilate them and they'd get so pissed and upset and phony Baloney. Unfortunately there are. But you know, that's a wonderful aspect of humanity if you've got the ability to, uh, to uh, to bring truth into the world and be honest about shit and you know, with all the faults and, and also great things about it.

Speaker 6:          02:06:33       Most human beings instinct is to go out there and just lie the fuck out of it and just make excuses changed shit around because you know, it's not good enough to just to have things exist and have it be true. No, we have to go ahead. And I mean, especially shit like religion, politics, it's just, Oh, let's make a book and call out the word of God. So therefore you can't fucking argue against it. Anything that happens. He said, well, the word of God, the word of God with garbage and then, uh, but essentially have a book that's compiled of other books. The end, you decided to leave other random shit out just because, and then, you know, it's gone through the hands of all these other people and all their other agendas from Jujitsu. It's because the basic idea of it was a human beings all throughout civilization. A full of shit when they flying line for, you know, obscuring the truth. There's a lot of guys that uh, don't have belts that are like, like super high level. Matt Hughes, Chris Lidell, Chris, we said Chris was a Brazilian jujitsu black belt. But apparently that was like even given it to us press sheets, Brazilian

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       Jiu Jitsu, blackbelt, Chris Lidell. No, he doesn't have any belt.

Speaker 6:          02:07:38       Probably not. No. He trained with those. Uh, speaking of a bunch of cats wrestlers that integrated fighting academy. Where, where was that? That was out in Indianapolis. That was Jason. God sees place.

Speaker 2:          02:07:50       You're such an interesting case. Knew because you were there like during the dark days, like you were there, like, like you were there when there was no regulation, you were there when you were allowed to wear shoes, you know, like kicking, stopping and that you're still here when it's not far.

Speaker 6:          02:08:06       The difference is that, you know, as I've developed as an athlete over the years, but the biggest thing is I developed my skills. So I'm not. Most of these fighters and you know, I'll, I'll say this and I'll say it publicly, they have most of these fighters that go through the system, let's say they get good enough that they get, let's say, to get in the UFC and we'll just use the UFC is the, as the, as the standard example, excuse me. So what they do is, uh, they get to a certain point and they get to enough a skill wise and then they just improve their athleticism to such a degree with. They'll get into the UFC, let's say, and let's say they're successful, they probably have about a two to three year window if they're good enough to be like a, to a, to get a title or be a title contender.

Speaker 6:          02:08:51       If they're that good, they got about two or three years at which they could potentially get a title or fight for a title. And after that then they're never been declined. And then they might still be successful enough to be still a viable, a fighter in the UFC. But even that lasts about is about only is about as much as five years. And after that throw them out because they're done. Their athleticism has dropped enough that they don't have the skills to back it up anymore. Most of these fighters just out athlete the other fighter for the most part. And, uh, they even did a big statistic about fight careers and the, once you get to seven years, the dropoff for success is astronomical and the idea of people going 10 years or 15 years like myself, unreal, like it's almost unheard of. And uh,

Speaker 2:          02:09:38       well not only that, but you go from age 20 to age 35,

Speaker 6:          02:09:42       19 to 35, 19 was my first time against a pro

Speaker 2:          02:09:47       and at 35, you're still amongst the top heavyweights in the world.

Speaker 6:          02:09:51       I could be any of those motherfuckers out there walking the earth right now.

Speaker 2:          02:09:55       If you had to, would you, I mean, if you had to retire for any reason, would you start coaching because I think you would have a lot to offer. I think you're, you have, um, just the fact that you've gotten through 15 years at a very high level, you know, I mean from your time and pride to today. I mean, that's a, it's a lot of God damn competition against very high level guys. You didn't have a lot of shit that you could teach kids that could cut out. Like you see like a lot of people that are being coached and being coached by people that don't have nearly the kind of experience that you have and you see some mistakes they're making with young talent. Sure,

Speaker 6:          02:10:31       I do. I see a lot of mistakes. And in terms of coaching, it's not just even about technique necessarily. A lot of it is they, they create a system and they think that everybody has to fit within that system and that there is no, there is no wavering from that system. And the thing is not any. Everybody is different. Everybody's an individual and everybody needs to be coached differently. I've had a and I have coached through the years and I've, I've coached people, the world championship fights, I've coached people to the world titles. I've had a, I think I've had more women at one time ranked in the top 10 and some, most of them ranked in the top five of the world and their respective way classes than any other coach. And then the baby food Fuji was making Fuji Jenelle Marquez. Shana Bassler. I've, we're going to hit told me, you know, uh, let's see. Uh,

Speaker 2:          02:11:16       so are you, are you want you, that what you want to do when you start fighting? No, no, because I was thinking that you didn't know a real shame because there's not a lot of guys who are fighters but have also taken the time to really sort of intellectually breakdown the properties of creating a fight.

Speaker 6:          02:11:35       I don't want to be a coach like that. I just don't because if I'm going to be a coach, think of it more as like an old school boxing coach or maybe one of these old catch coaches where you only really, okay. Someone proves to you enough that they're worth giving that kind of time and information. I don't just look at it as well, I'm just going to show you some move. By the way, this move came from this coach came from that coach came. Do you know how many hundreds of years of development came behind this? Do you know how difficult it was for someone to the original person down the line to get this thing to me with the shit that they had to go through and to live their life and to harness these techniques and give them to me. These things are precious,

Speaker 2:          02:12:16       so I understand that, but when I see a guy like you and I see, you know, you have 35 years of age. I mean totally respectfully and honestly. I mean, what do you got five years left? Ten years left. If you're, I guess Randy coture style, I'm done. You never know. You know what I mean? With today it was nutrition and training methods. Who knows with skill, but when, if a guy like you got a hold of John Jones type character, you could take a motherfucker to the next level. You know what I mean? If you, if you really started like approaching. Okay, Jon Jones, is it an anomaly? He's just, he's a bad motherfucker. He, anybody could make him good. Yes and no. Yes, and without a doubt. Mike Winkeljohn has done some amazing things. Without a doubt. He's brilliant. Without a doubt, John is a prodigy. John is a. he's a very intense, powerful human being. John Jones, besides his physicality, which is obviously very gifted, his mind is very powerful and I think he would be great that he would figure it out watching other people, no matter who was coaching, he, he's the kind of guy that's going to excel no matter what. But having a guy like Winkeljohn who's a brilliant striking code, they really different being

Speaker 6:          02:13:30       somebody that like,

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       you know, taking that middle of the pack guy and that one and developing them into a world champion that's always going to get that. You'll never be. But it depends. I mean, and that's what I'm saying is I'm not going to. Because there's a lot going on there, right? I'm not talking necessarily about who I would coach. You just be like the ones that just shine as. No, I want to coach. I would coach a person that I feel personality, integrity, character mentality as well as physicality all matches what I think is worth investing the time into. So you would do that, but they would have to. He'd be like special people came onto up on the mountain top when you're alone fucking chopping wood and then you will make them like fences and shit.

Speaker 6:          02:14:08       Right? You know, I wax on carbon carbon. Some ruins into their body. So you're going to do it like we go chapel really style still works, still works with Mac Danzig. He works at a few people, but he's not the man. I, I, that's one of those guys I have a shit ton of respect for. I do have one. I think Ricoh is um, often, you know, he's so unknown to so many of these guys out there that claim to be mma aficionados. They just don't know their ass from a hole in the wall. It really don't know. And that there's people out there like Rico who's wrestling is fantastic. Who's mind to fighting is great. Who, whose attitude is, you know, you want to get in there with this and this is what you want to do. I can, I can help you with that and I can show you if you're going to fucking slack off, fuck around, whatever you think you know better than all, then fuck you. Then take off. I don't need you.

Speaker 3:          02:14:51       And he smokes weed all day or day or a day to day and he will choke you all day. Fuck your shit. And I really respect Mac Danzig a lot. I like Mac as a human being. I think he's really, he's just, he's just a solid dude. I love that guy. I know he's grumpy, but he's just because he's smart as fuck. He's always super cool to me too. He just has a low tolerance for dummies. I still do. I really do. I can't stand fucking idiots. But Matt speaks so highly of Rico, you know, and what Rico is done and helping as he should. Yeah. But I just, as a coach, there's so much investment

Speaker 6:          02:15:26       goes into that and that it's not something I'm, I'm not saying I won't coach. Uh, and if the availability is there a and the possibility is there, but I just, I got a lot of Shit, you know what I'm done with fighting a whenever that day comes, which is going to suck in its own right. But uh, I got other shit I can do with my life. Other things I'm trying to accomplish, you know? Um, I mean a male model.

Speaker 3:          02:15:51       Well, little underwear modeling perhaps a little bit, little bit, little bit. I mean we got to do a lot of padding, but I think we can make the most of it. I mean, prosthetics are pretty impressive. Don't go prosthetic, but the little dick, but a big smile. Oh man, fuck it. Little Little Chubby. A little turtle or let it swing. It gives a fuck. You're Josh Barnett. Still Suck it. But the easier so much just you ever watch a porn when the guys get a little dick and this girl's like licking his bowl. She's already in so happy about it. It's like an easy, easy deal and it's just, it's a, it's more like convenience. Yeah. The guy with the little deck, like maybe there's a benefit to that, like the sheer, now she's deep throat and him and it's, you know, it's not that impressive, but it

Speaker 6:          02:16:30       looks like he's having a good time and, and she's like, this is, this is not straining. Stressing me. One of dudes with John Hancock's feel more pleasure because there's more pleasure. Just more skin, more, more, more skin is getting close. Like if a girl's giving you a blow job and she goes in deeper, it feels better than if she's shallow. Right? It's definitely something that's mental commodities. Even chick begin feeling it hit the back and she keep going. So you're like, oh wow. We just. The idea of it alone, someone's willing to suck on your tablet. I only half mast right now.

Speaker 5:          02:17:00       I'm, I'm ready. If you had the girl like where you go so far and they start like puking, like the stomach acid all over your mouth during the porn movies today in the wrong girls. How am I started up? They got to relax yourself, I guess to get these girls to throw up on your Dick. That's like bio and stuff. It feels good actually. It's awesome. What if they don't? Uh, if those girls don't, they don't watch their diet and they're probably like all anorexic and signs of like weird cat food all over it. Fuck, are you talking about cat food? Maybe I'd eight different girls. And you do, but everybody does a who hates cats. He dates cats day cats, cat food. There are so finicky. You did it again.

Speaker 6:          02:17:44       It took it to a bad place. Where, uh, where were we going with this before we got on a blow jobs and small Dicks, I don't know. Terrible places. One of the things that you wanted to talk about when you, you, you, uh, contacted me about coming on the podcast is all this craziness that's going on with all these school shootings and school shootings. It was the, uh, the Oregon shooting. I guess that one was in a mall and all this shit. Yeah. Well, and the interesting thing about the mall, one that's coming out now is that he was confronted by an armed civilian and that's when he shot himself. And that's not something that's being talked about very much. Why would they? That doesn't work with the agenda at hand of why. And you know, that's, that's hard of a problem, right? A huge problem is that we've got media that wants to just create knee jerk reactions and emotional responses.

Speaker 6:          02:18:29       They don't care about trying to deliver a whole unbiased story. They've each got an agenda to try and put a rift in the populace at general at large. And that's fucking irresponsible and is terrible. I was listening to a, something that would come on about a, it was either MSNBC or CNN and after the horrible Sandy Hook, tragedy, uh, one of the teachers, boyfriends have a year. They found him and started giving their full interview on. I'm just going, why I don't want to. This is completely one. It's just giving more prudent credence to, hey, you want to do something crazy and be fucking famous forever. Here's more publicity for you. It's like, well, you didn't have anything else better to do than talk to a guy. Oh, I knew her for a year. And like you were some guy, some guy for a year, it wasn't even crying, like you didn't even miss her.

Speaker 6:          02:19:19       It was like, it was no big deal and he was on CNN. Maybe he really did fucking, you know, he was super torn up about it, whatever. But it doesn't fucking matter because why are you on TV? Why is the news finding that to be important to talk about? Why shouldn't we be talking about something more important? Like why is our culture devolving in such a way that people are acting in such manner, whether they're shooting people or fucking stabbing them or robbing them or car jacking him and taking them back to a place and raping and torturing him. Like what the fuck is going on? Why? Why is humanity at large doing this kind of shit? And then the other thing, so another channel. I'm sitting here and I just hear it coming into the ears and I hear they're talking about how some Republican, his, you know, he keeps, he throws out the word assault weapon like 17 times.

Speaker 6:          02:20:04       Uh, every, every fucking statement he's got to make. He's really trying to pin, you know, pound something home with his lingo and then there's a, the reporter goes on after talking about this guy who was gonna, you know, probably working towards creating bills about this ship will, she'll probably be back ended with all kinds of shit that have nothing to do with it, which they always do, always, you know, it's just fucking absolute tantamount lying. It's absolute fucking lying. Irresponsible. And it should be absolutely anil loud. So. So after that, this, this reporter goes on about, you know, something about, you know, people go and makes an offhand comment about people going to gun shows and just not just willy nilly buying firearms and in that, just like, I just couldn't fucking take it anymore. Didn't Bruno true. Proven. That's true. Didn't he go to a gun store as a gay character?

Speaker 6:          02:20:56       Didn't? Uh, I dunno, I haven't seen the movie. I mean, but here's the deal. I guess it wasn't in Bruno was on the show. I, uh, I, you know, who knows what they're doing on shows the people you can people have sold potentially. I could see it a fucking shady stuff. Yeah. But people will sell guns, not at gun shows. They get some other way. I mean, fuck. So here's the deal. I am a lifelong hobbyist when it comes to firearms. I, it was, uh, it was something I inherited from my dad who a big time hobbyist. And when I say hobbyist, I reload. Meaning I make my own ammunition. Like I buy bullets have different weights and shapes and sizes. I buy different types of powders to have to burn at different rates. And you know, all this shit is very. Exactly. I Buy Bras and primers and I match all this shit up based on recipes through, uh, the, the ammunition manufacturers that sell this stuff through my dad's own research on certain, you know.

Speaker 6:          02:21:55       And the thing is every firearm that you're doing this for is entirely different. You could have three, 19, 11, 45, all the same barrel length, all the same manufacturer, but they're not all going to shoot the same. Not exactly in one load is going to shoot different than the other other. Some bullet weights depending on barrel length. The amount of rifling has gone nuts. I'm a gun nut. Okay. And uh, you know, I grew up not only with that but my dad inherited from, from people in his life, the hobby of, of target shooting and, and, you know, gun smithing and creating your and just being a, just a nerd about guns. Like I'm a nerd about cars, but he was a hunter. And when, when, uh, and he was growing up, that's what you did. He grew up in the fucking woods of, of southwestern Washington.

Speaker 6:          02:22:44       Uh, he was a logger from as early as he could. He worked in paper mills. He's been in the forest all his whole fucking life almost. And so hunting, fishing game, all that kind of stuff. And uh, you know, I've been out there in the woods with him since I was a kid going hunting and catch, you know, getting animals, cleaning them, dressing. I'm going through the whole process and I can tell you one thing. Fucking being a hunter and being somebody that had spent so much time in the wilderness and Anon, the Anon, the ocean and boats fishing and all this made me appreciate nature like a gazillion times more than I think anybody that doesn't necessarily. I think nature is something that is overlooked huge and I don't think we as humans sometimes really understand the vastness and the impressiveness of of mother earth as a general and you know, being out there in the mountains and seeing the animals and the uniting when you're hunting them.

Speaker 6:          02:23:37       Just being involved in this whole process and just knowing them and then taking an animal and going through that whole process of, of all the care and responsibility that comes to to do this correctly and then serve this meat to other people. And when, when my family didn't have money, when they're broke as fuck. The animals that my dad had caught help feed that family that my. They're all broke living in this little apartment in north Seattle and no unexcused. They go out there with their tags and they'd get their, their, their, their elk or they get their deer. They would, they would catch fish, they would grouse all the, you know, fuck, that all went onto the table, you know, and that was a big part of that, that growing up for me. And so I've had gun responsibility. I've been shooting since I was a kid and being a responsible parent is why, uh, from the get like one guns were always locked up.

Speaker 6:          02:24:29       They're always in safes. I don't know how to get into these fucking things. I'm not allowed access to this shit as a child or even as an 18 year old, like that ain't happening. Like I didn't know that the combination to my dad's gun safe until I was almost 30 years old, you know what I mean? And other than that mean if there was a possibility, let's say, and I didn't know because this was never spoken about, if there was even the potential that there was a firearm, let's say for home defense, that was somewhere, let's say in my parents room, but I didn't know about through the fear of fucking God, I wouldn't step in there. My Dad had me so afraid of fucking with his shit or anything in their room as a responsible parent. That never happened. I knew fucking way better. And the idea if I ever, if he ever found out if I ever laid hands on a gun that he wasn't around. Alright, well you what you're ascribing sounds like an ideal situation

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       to grow up and raise someone in an environment where you teach them firearm safety and respect for firearms and appreciation for firearm. Absolutely. The real debate is not that though. The real debate is the fact that if the guns are out there, it's not just you and you're responsible parents that are going to have these guns. It's this crazy motherfucker in Connecticut and is nutty mother that he killed. And then took her guns and shot up all those poor kids. Absolutely. That's the where the real issue comes in. It's like, well, how do you stop that from happening?

Speaker 6:          02:25:50       Exactly. And, and I, uh, and through through all this, and I'm a time spent, you know, actually having firearms as a hobby. I, uh, you know, I ended up working in the industry of selling firearms and buying them through a thrift shop and, uh, in Washington. And uh, I can tell you like everything that went through that shop, everything that was ever done all had to go through the federal program, the, the instant criminal, national, instant criminal background check system. The Knicks and I had to call in every fucking thing every single time. And this whole thing was insistent in pr in, in the system for a reason. And I can't say that it's perfect because I know it ain't, it's a federal government, you know, there's no way that it's perfect. In fact, you know, reading the information on Nick's, you know, they like to claim that, uh, over, you know, since uh, being put in, in [inaudible] 93, there's a over 100 million checks in the last decade leading the morning, 700,000 denials of firearms in the hands of people that it shouldn't be.

Speaker 6:          02:26:52       But the problem is that you look at some of this stuff and what the things that they might deny you for sometimes there's the simple issue of I'm a concealed weapons owner or a permit holder in Washington, which means I already had to go through fingerprinting. I had to fill out all this paperwork. I had to go through a process and get approved to get my concealed weapons permit. And uh, when that meant, when I went to a gun store, even the one I worked at a, if I want to purchase a handgun, which normally has a waiting period because I'm a concealed weapons permit holder and I've already gone through all these extra checks. I fill out all the paperwork like everyone else had. All gets filed with the serial number of the gun. And what I'm purchasing and so on and so forth and uh, and I still go through the next check list like everybody else, but because there was somebody in California who had a similar name to mind every time I would call in with my social security number of my weapons license number, like all this different information and data for at least three years.

Speaker 6:          02:27:48       I was always put on a hold with every firearm I bought. And even if that included a rifle, which is normally a same day thing after nick's all every single time because they would always see that there's some stuff in it and they will always in. The thing about it is the fact that there's a hold put on that could last anywhere from, you know, three hours they might call back or you know, three days. It wasn't having a whole. That was, that ever bothered me whatsoever. It's like, okay, whatever. It's just that there isn't like why isn't this not being updated? Like you're being given very specific information about me as a person. So I want my, you know, if I'm going to have this database is going to be used to try and be a responsible about having firearms, not in the hands of people that it shouldn't be.

Speaker 6:          02:28:36       Why are you not updating this enough to know that I'm not that fucking guy. And eventually three years, two or three years later down the road it came about and now that's not the case anymore for me, far as I know I haven't bought a Po, a purchase a firearm in a long time. But uh, and then when it came to going to gun shows, which I've been a member, I've been going to gun shows since I was a kid because my dad would go there and my uncle and you know. And then even especially when I worked for the gun shop, I would go there and help out at shows. Maybe if we had a table, a different stuff. You go to a gun show and even as a concealed weapons license holder, I mean anybody that comes to the gun show, you pay your admission, boom, you can come in if you want to purchase a firearm and this goes for the Washington arms collector association who runs all their gun shows and Washington. You have to go and do another line and fill out and have all your paperwork, whereas you have the same in every state. I'm not sure now I cannot speak for every state, but I know that me growing up as a working and being a part of the Washington arms collector association and all that and going to their gun shows, uh, you have to go get nicks checked.

Speaker 2:          02:29:34       Well that's all well and good man. But, and, and how do you stop letting this kid who did this in Connecticut? I mean, he violated a bunch. He approached. He already started leaving the house. He started off off

Speaker 6:          02:29:44       by murdering his mom. Yeah, that's already, that's not good. No, it's not good. And why does a guy murder their, their parents in the first place? That's the problem. And the thing is, is that, you know, he, he went and he chose to use the tool of firearms to go off and do whatever that is that he decided to. And I still can't figure out why the fuck in the first place. Did he go to a school and shoot children of all things, like I don't understand that, that rationale. Like what did it accomplish? What was the statement? What was he trying to prove? I don't know. There's not to mention there's even stuff floating about on the Internet where the dads have not only this, uh, the sandy hook killer and the killer from the Batman movie a shooting both somehow have something to do with a banking and financial stuff that has actually been disproven.

Speaker 6:          02:30:36       Well, no, they're not actually going to go to the library a scandal as, as they're trying to say that they're both going to be at the library hearing, but they're not. But yet the Batman shooters dad is apparently some, a statistical analysis, whatever kind of guy that what he does, he creates these algorithms that are used in banking. Did the decipher all this shit. And figure all this shit out and what it is, is that the shit that he creates, these algorithms, these mathematical things are the same things that you use to figure out that libraries as being is that the library scandals, shit, all the line that's been done in the rates being so he's involved or maybe even just on a cursory way in terms of figuring out the people that are cheating you with the banks and then the other guy, the dad of the sandy hook killer, he's apparently it works at some financial institution of some sort and his division has three people underneath them that are being indicted for having being a part of this live worship and using the falsified a ratings to to

Speaker 2:          02:31:36       how many people are involved in the or scandal. I mean it isn't impossible.

Speaker 6:          02:31:39       It was just coincidence. It could be and I'm not, I'm not. I'm not sitting there saying that this all is necessarily related and I, I'm sure that there is fucked up parenting. That you've got kids that are being medicated to death and who knows what he's taking because apparently he was mentally ill and, and there are drugs out there that they will give our kids and they will give people and have them walk the streets that some of the side effects are suicidal thoughts, homicidal act. I mean it's just ridiculous. You're jamming all this medication down, a human being and you expect them to function within our society like anybody else.

Speaker 2:          02:32:09       Well, the real issue, um, the actual numbers, the, a citizens' commission on human rights of CCHR has said that out of the last 14 recent school shootings, all of them were committed by those taking or withdrawing from psychiatric drugs resulting in 109 wounded, 58 killed. It was also at least 22 international drug regulatory warnings that have been issued on psychiatric drugs causing side effects of mania, psychosis, aggression, hostility, violence, and even homicidal. I, I think a big part of it is that it's not everybody you know. And that's important for a lot of people that are on that shit, that it does them good. It helps them. But there's a lot of people that can't drink also, you know, there's a lot of people they drink and they're gone, you know, so you see the switch go off and they become an alcoholic. The everybody's got a different setup.

Speaker 2:          02:33:01       And for some people these things are not good. And um, when, when you're talking about those numbers, you could. I've seen people argue and it's really fascinating, the people that are like really opposed to anything that might be fuckery. You know, there's a lot of people like, oh, there's this, there's no cars which are just. So you're talking about people are fucked up. Of course people are fucked up on drugs. It doesn't mean the drugs are causing them and you don't know that that's a really good. But it's a weird thing where chemical composition of your brain. But there's this, this sort of pro science stance that a lot of people want to take that are people that think that there's a lot of people wearing tinfoil hats and looking for conspiracies and looking for nonsense and everything. But man, they're like the same type of people that want to downplay the possibility that any sort of, um, vaccinations have been damaging to children. Right. That's, that's another weird one that people don't want. It was weird and address I

Speaker 6:          02:33:56       think the strongest argument for all of that as even potential. And I'm not talking about that. I wear tinfoil hats or anything like that, but something I stated, you know, I touched on earlier throughout mankind, we fucking lie. We lie and we cheat our, our populous constantly over and over and over. We do it religion, we do it with our politics. They constantly, you know, you have companies that go and they deliberately destroy the environment with their chemicals and their shit and they know they're doing it and they know that it's destroying shit and they just know that they can get away with it and they just lie. And then all of a sudden boom there have somebody comes out of the woodwork and make them accountable for it. And then they backtrack and they tell a whole bunch more lies. They feed them a couple of goats and then they keep on doing the same bullshit and they never have to pay the price for.

Speaker 6:          02:34:45       We have all these politicians that go out there and when they try to feed us all these lines about how they're, you know, they're this, they're part of that side and this other side is wrong and vice versa and split us as a populous and then they go and they, they, they claim all these great things they're going to do. You know, they do nice, tricky, Wonderful Shit. Like, Hey, I'm just about to get reelected. So now. Yeah, gay marriage. Great. I totally support it. Why don't you say a four years ago, you piece of shit. Yeah. You piece of shit. You know, he wasn't your son cares. Here's something crazy. More than one in 10 in the United States. Take antidepressants. Should they be. How about, you know, good question. I'll tell you something. I remember having a. What does that number? How many is that one in 10 million people.

Speaker 6:          02:35:27       So what does that 30 million. A 3 million I think know 30 million. Yeah. $300. Yeah, 30 million. That's insane. It's not 30 million people out there walking the street, all the fucking PROZAC, Xanax to whatever up. And I remember, I remember going through a really fucking bad breakup not that long ago and just fucking dying and having anxiety for the first time. I've never had that shit. I've got a lot of shit go down in my life, but I've never had this fucked up anxiety and all. I'm not sleeping and I'm having a hard time getting full deep breaths. All this shit. Trash Strip clubs. Uh, yeah. I definitely did strip clubs. I hope it helps some but a little bit, but it's like a little bridge. Yeah. Bridge to happiness. But uh, but the thing was, is that I knew that I could probably hit up somebody and get a pill, take all that shit away.

Speaker 6:          02:36:16       And to me I thought that's a fucking coward's way out. That's not the way you do it because going through this shit means something. It's something that I need to do to be a stronger, better, more well adjusted man. Like I need to go through this and deal with it because dealing with it is how you make yourself better in the future so you know, you go through a cold instead of getting the vaccine flu instead of getting vaccinated, so now your body knows how to adapt to it, so you go through depression and figuring out how to solve it and not get depressed again. And I'm not saying that there aren't people out there that, that WHO's chemical balances for whatever reason have gotten all twisted up and they really do need help. That's the real issue is when I knew that, but for me I could tell that wasn't the case. You know, I was just fucking heartbroken. Right? That, that's what it was and it was. It was not really few fine. Poor Josh Barnett on the inside. Oh yeah. This is never going to find her again, by the way. Yeah. The idea is that, you know, it's not either or. I think the

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       same thing. Yeah, he's cute and very funny, but I don't think you'd ever be together. I just can't get over the fact that he likes guns. It's creepy and a little scary. Somebody as smart as him shouldn't need a gun to feel like a man, be a man, lose the gun to shoot loads in her. Oh Man. It's a blast. Hide my guns in a hole in the backyard and pretend kind of propaganda is fucked up. It's like, you know, I've, I've, I own quite a few firearms and most of it for the collection of it, like I'm a nerd, you know, and that's the people that inhabit all those, uh, those evil gun shows, fat, balding, social awkward. They're just nerds, nerds, nerds, nerds, that people that buy all the assault weapons that everyone wants to go on about. All these crazy solves all these crazy capabilities.

Speaker 3:          02:38:02       Gun nerds, nerds. That's it. That's who buys these fucking thinks is. Those are the only people that can afford them or have the interest to have them. Well, that's not true because there's always crazy. It's such a huge amount of crazy people that share them. There is a small amount. That's when people really don't understand. When it comes to the numbers of guns, it's like there's like Pierce Morgan. I thought he was going on this crazy rant about, oh, you know, America has this love affair with guns and look where it's got us and look, it's. It's so dangerous. Guns is doing it well. Yeah. The people, first of all, you got to think about how many people are not doing it. Okay. Because there's so many armed motherfuckers in this country. It's amazing gun. I don't walk around pulling guns on people. When you get on the highway and you see a like a traffic accident, it's amazing how few you find they are God damn millions of cars flying, going 60, 70 miles an hour all around each other, all the time in each other and they aren't hitting each other.

Speaker 3:          02:38:51       I mean, what? What we have to realize is that when you're dealing with a society, a complex society like what we have now, complex, credible numbers, the number of people is absolutely staggering. You know what? I read something recently, like America itself is like the only example of so many cultures and races and mixing all the way that it does. Like you go to Europe and it's like, for the most part, almost all countries are pretty much homogeneous, right? With a few exceptions of experts and people from other general, like in America we said, you know what? No, everybody of any kind at any religion of any faith, of any creative, any color, bring them all together and to take all these different cultures, some quite different, you know, when you, let's say from a root culture to know before becoming an American, let's say early stages of American, how even vast Irish could be from Italian and how they're brought up and um, their upbringings.

Speaker 3:          02:39:46       I mean fuck, I mean there's so many different and yet we managed to put together this country that has survived, you know, however many hundred so years as it has and has done some pretty amazing things. Yeah. Without us trying to all murder each other all the time. I think there's some issues that we definitely have to be addressed. One of them is this antidepressant thing, and I'm not saying that people should not be on it because I know people that have been on it and it's helped them and changed their life and saved their life. He sure, but maybe you shouldn't have a fucking gun when you're on it because it seems like

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       a lot of people that are on these things and take guns. That's where my problem is, that that's not okay

Speaker 6:          02:40:18       listed as one of the things about next, but probably because of a pharmaceutical industry that, and the, you know, under the guise of the whole patient confidentiality. Now they say in the, in the statutes that, you know, they can, they can, your, you cannot have a gun if you're a under indictment, uh, for crime punishable by imprisonment, a exceeding one year. All these different things, illegal, alien, agitated. Now here's the one that's even similar to being on antidepressants and all this is who has been educated as a mental, defective or has been committed to any mental institution. Okay? That's where they commit you. Right? And so, you know, by the, under the probably the laws of, uh, of medical confidence, therefore it's like, oh, we can't just tell people, oh, this guy is all jacked up on like four different antidepressants. We can't just say, oh, well you can't have a firearm based on that alone.

Speaker 6:          02:41:07       Where I think, yeah, actually we probably should. In fact, if it was really to be honest, my, my whole thing is I wish that there was a way we had a, uh, a licensing system to get your firearm. Just like you have to get a car. Like you have to prove your, you have to take competency tests, you have to prove competency, you have to improve understanding of the mechanics of the firearm itself, how it operates, how to take it apart, how to understand taking care of it, how to operate it. I agree on this thing safely. And then then, then once you've passed such a certain, you know, uh, you know, amount of testing, then you can be given a card and then you meet, you know, can go out there and buy a farm. I really think that apps people are not, but I also believe that that we as a populace are so irresponsible, even more so with our motor vehicles that is not even funny, that the how easy it is to get behind the wheel of a 4,000 pound car and go out there and kill each other is ridiculous and it's way too easily available to anyone and people love just creating the hot button topics and it's easy to get people fired up about something.

Speaker 6:          02:42:10       Has guns. You don't need those, but we need cars. Great.

Speaker 2:          02:42:13       Well, I've seen people say, you know, if you could get another, you know, you go, you got to go hunting. Get another fucking hobby. I've actually seen people write that down. That's the answer I've seen. People say, Oh, I wish that the animals were armed to what you were saying all about licensing and everything that all that's all well and good, but here's the problem. That kid, it was not as fucking gun. No, he went and legal. It's illegal use of the guns, which is also the case with the kids in Columbine. Illegal. They murdered somebody, installed them, yes. So you're always gonna have that problem if those guns exist and also potentially

Speaker 6:          02:42:46       let's say that mother had gone through all that training and, and, and, and in doing so locked her guns up.

Speaker 2:          02:42:52       Well, you know, you now you're going really far. You trying to make someone a responsible parent almost fucking of course. But

Speaker 6:          02:42:59       is that when, when people are forced to do something through responsible means to actually acquire the, improve themselves capable of owning the opportunity to be responsible like that. And, and trust me, you know, me talking about having government which I already think is incredibly irresponsible and does things for its own reasons, create more, you know, licensing, you know, I mean there's always a concern like, okay, well then they just decided that nobody can ever pass and therefore no one can ever have a gun regulatory

Speaker 2:          02:43:24       bodies that do their job. I'm out of passion first. For instance, fish and game fish and game does a pretty fucking good job, but he spent the money is all from hunting tags and you know, and that that's what pays for conservation efforts. A lot of people don't understand that that fishing game does a very good job of managing the wildlife in this country. People, one of the most efficient. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:43:44       How the hunting tags or even re relegate it out there to the populace is because uh, they've, they've, they've studied the heard the train and all these different animals and how, how they've been getting sick or how healthy they are, how many infants they've had and all this, and they calculate how many tags they can allow to give out. And then there's even for dose, okay, well you have to go into a lottery to get a doe tag to go ahead and be able to hunt a doe. And so that's kind of that. That whole figure has come up by, by being on top of what's going on with the animals.

Speaker 2:          02:44:15       Yeah. It's knowledge. It's based on people who are actually. They're concerned about the environment, right? They're not trying to get. No one's getting rich off of that. It's all passionate hunters and they want to conserve the environment under his love,

Speaker 6:          02:44:25       the environment and some of the most environmentally responsible and important organization in the world are full of basically. Huh?

Speaker 2:          02:44:32       And there's a problem that people don't understand when you advocate against hunting is that, well, if you're not the top of the food chain, that you better bring somebody in who's going to do the dirty work because if you don't, you're going to have all these prey animals. They're going to be running rampant all over the place. You have to do something because there's not enough food. And the, the idea that if you don't kill them, they're just gonna be okay and peaceful and live with us. You're crazy. They're going to slam into cars, they're going to die of starvation and you're going to have a Predator population increase.

Speaker 6:          02:45:00       There's a responsibility as human beings on this planet and our involvement in this planet's ecosystem can manage that. We have to, we have to work on managing it. And uh, and that's the thing, but I mean, but I think it should be more difficult to get a car. I really, I agree. I mean it's like, I agree, it's 70. Think of it as a right, 76,000 people were involved in fatal crashes. Now they didn't die, but that's 76,000 fucking people that. How many of those could have been solved by not texting. Irresponsible bullshit. Just, you know, it should be a lot more difficult to get behind the wheel and I want that kind of responsibility. I would love to see that to, for someone to own a firearm. And then even besides that, if you, let's say you take all the guns away, if we have people that are doped up or fucking crazy or whatever and they're going out, let's say say the Batman guy just walked into the theater with an ax and he fucking nailed three people.

Speaker 6:          02:45:48       He just. Three people die for no fucking good reason, right? But the idea is it's not 33 because he doesn't have guns. He's not, he's not wearing. And I'm not going to give any examples because I'm not that asshole like a lot of the media. Well, where they'll sit there and say, well, Hey, guess what? This is how you made x, Y, Z or how you do this and give a fucking information out there to people so they can go out and some other Wacko can do it, but look, I could sit here with you in private until you at least three different ways. I probably could've killed everybody in that theater. Yeah, no, there's way the more strategic about it and the thing is why we got to solve the problem of, of our populace murdering the rest of us. Okay. But you and it's America and it's a total rare a thing as it is.

Speaker 6:          02:46:28       Like if you added up all the people that out of how many we have in the, in, in America versus how many are are, are coming under. It's still. I mean in as pure statistics game, we're not. It's not like it's still a fucking super rare thing. I'm sure there's a statistics person that can tell you the likelihood of you actually being involved in a shooting at all in anywhere in America. Well, let's get down to the nitty gritty because we only got a couple of minutes left for you. Turn into a pumpkin. Three, three hours were useless. Um, what, what is the solution then? I mean, is it arming schools? No. Army. No, definitely not. That's the thing. It's an armed guard and that kind of shit from happening. I had a, we had an armed guard at our school. Like I, I think there should at this point in A.

Speaker 6:          02:47:10       I don't think there's anything wrong with an arm chair. No, but we had armed, uh, an arm. Just a police officer. Yeah. We had an officer on our school and I had a pretty gnarly school. We didn't have shooting. Well, no, I guess we did have a shooting girl got shot in the face seven times by some little Asian gangster kid. Whoa. But, and then we had a girl got shot in, but you know, and that was fucking super tragic. And uh, you know, the key to all of that also is that she was hanging around all these bad fucking dudes and these bad dudes were doing bad shit. And you know, it's like if you. It's not like they came down to just to shoot anybody. Right. You know what I mean? I don't think they didn't even come to shoot her specifically and it's just like a.

Speaker 6:          02:47:45       and then you know, why do these kids want to live this lifestyle where they're running around shooting each other anyways, what? I mean it's just like fucked up parents to live education, whatever, and then it ends up in this girl getting shot and it's pointless. But yeah, we had an awesome solution that NRA rhetoric about putting guards and I in front of all these fucking schools, like that doesn't change the problem. What if we took all the guards that are working for the dea, have them guard the schools. We killed two birds with which we just put one of them in every school so that you. And maybe these people could not only just be in the school of standing around with a gun, but maybe they could also be an influence on people as far as like just being like, Hey, guess what? I'm here to defend you, but I'm doing it as an upright fucking citizen and this is why it's important.

Speaker 6:          02:48:31       Well, that would be like a volunteer sort of a militia type thing. Is that what you mean? Something like that. Well, he doesn't like that shit, but even if it was regulated, I'm cool with that. I'm just saying that, you know, do one further. My, my, my point where I'm getting to with this is that it's not just the having an armed guard. Here's the thing that helps change this from, from people just blindly shooting each other and whatever community. We don't have any fucking community anymore. No one's responsible and when I say responsible, they're not just respond. You know what? Just responsible for yourself in a community. You keep an eye out, hey, you got some crazy fucking psycho kid. Keep an eye on. Let other people know. Like, Hey, by the way, tom is actually fucking weird right now and we need to be aware of that so that he, you know, everybody just work. Everybody just wants a little mom's house nowadays. That's, that's my example. They just want a big hand to come over and wash all their laundry, do everything, and they don't want to see or be a part of the process and made all that happen anymore. I think that

Speaker 2:          02:49:23       random or sort of a big, broad way community is definitely the answer. I think that what's going on now, what we were talking about with Internet trolls and people getting exposed and realizing that anonymity is slowly slipping away. I think ultimately that's going to lead to a bigger sense of community because we're going to have repercussions for actions and thoughts. Homes are going to have access to each other in a way that I don't think we've ever had before. I'm hoping that this is a stage of humanity. I think we are really involved in some sort of a, a more, a metamorphosis, uh, growing and developing because of this technology and because of this sort of connection that people share with people. And I don't want to be live in society. I don't want to overstate it, but that's the feeling that I get from people that benefit from this show on the Internet. That's the things that people benefit from reading things and being exposed to things and lectures and Ted talks and shit that they really wouldn't have had, that

Speaker 6:          02:50:19       we need to participate more. You know, it's one thing to listen. It's another thing to to to listen to a show and then stay in your own fucking bubble and never participate in the rest of your community. You need to be a part of your community, need to be to know your fellow man. You need to know your fucking neighbor. You need to know you. The more you're a part of this, now all of a sudden you're not just some random drone that nobody knows or ever know and now you're a human being that the interacts with other human beings and now you're forming this greater and stronger bond that's gonna. Look out for each other.

Speaker 2:          02:50:45       Yeah. We have to sort of somehow or another feel a need for that and as a society, as a society, figure out how to engineer that, that sense of community again, and I've been trying to get all my friends to move on the same block, but none of these motherfuckers are willing to move out to my neighborhood. We're going to have to buy a patch of land and do it cult style. But I really think that, that, you know, wouldn't it be the best way to live is to like have most of your friends like in your neighborhood, instead of being in some neighborhoods shirt with strangers, which is how most of us live.

Speaker 6:          02:51:16       Or even if we're in a neighborhood full of strangers, why don't we make the time to make them not strangers? It's fucking ass music. Wife and a country dog. Get Out of my driveway. Fuck face. I just moved into a new place and uh, at some point, once I get it all put together, I want to hold an open house in my own little area. Like invite all my neighbors that come by and fucking going to know how shit is coming and stealing my shit. Yeah. Pancakes, belt. They're going to go out there and fucking wander up and down the streets looking at some good ideas.

Speaker 2:          02:51:43       Josh Barnett. What'd you need to do is be a fucking leader. You need to go out there and start the Josh Barnett School for how to be a fucking man, right?

Speaker 6:          02:51:49       Sorry. The ripple in the water. That. That'd be the drop in the water. That starts the ripples, man. That's the best thing anybody can do. And it starts small, but it gets bigger and it really does. You start by exam.

Speaker 2:          02:51:58       It starts by what you're doing just by being you. Just by having a character. Being a fucking man.

Speaker 6:          02:52:03       Starts Small and gets big like A. I just found

Speaker 5:          02:52:06       out that you were in my favorite video game. Beautiful Academy.

Speaker 6:          02:52:09       I guess I'm the wrestler if you enroll me up.

Speaker 5:          02:52:11       How, how, how'd you get connected? This is your second category game too.

Speaker 6:          02:52:15       Uh, I don't, I don't know. You know, they just fucking, they'd. Somebody dug me. That was into the game and they put me in it and not to mention there's a, there's a game called no more heroes. It was on the wheat and I think you can buy it on the PS three now even. And the main character looks like a Johnny Knoxville. But everything about the dude is based on me. Oh, that's hilarious. And a about the idea of, of this guy going out there and fighting the, finding some debt assassin on accident and grabbing his weapon. Now he becomes part of the assassin's guild. And so the thing is, he's now number 10, so he just starts fucking fighting them all and killing them just to get to number one,

Speaker 5:          02:52:49       play this game. What is it? Oh, this is where you roll up all the junk. And uh, he made this big giant ball of yarn and you're one of the characters. I'm one of the characters you can, you can roll up into this big ball of fluff. It's my favorite game of all time to. It's weird that you're in it. Simply amused. He, oh, he's a musician.

Speaker 2:          02:53:07       Way Simpler than that. That's one of the more complex aspects of his life. Powerful. Josh Barnett, thank you very much for joining us, brother. Always a pleasure. Anytime you ever want to come on again and taught. I mean, I don't think we really got to the bottom of this because I don't think you can, but I know it's your insight, especially as an intelligent guy and you're allowed to fucking enjoy fighting and guns and allowed to enjoy all these things and you're not a bad guy. You're not a fucking a blight on society. You're not a criminal. You're not doing anything wrong. And I think that needs to be represented as well because in you don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. All Right, ladies and gentlemen, freedom ain't free. Okay? It's not saying enough cliches.

It's called audience participation here called ad libbing. Ladies and gentlemen, I add flavor to the stew based on the circumstances, but it's available by Joe Rogan.net. It's fucking hilarious.

We didn't even get a chance to talk about junior dos Santos and Cain Velasquez.

Speaker 3:          02:57:36       Not Talk about that junior. Here's the deal. Cane doesn't get his take down game going with his distance on a striking early on. And Juniors dictating pace and distance on unstopped and the takedown, it's the only going to farms away. He's going to take them out. Uh, I don't think he's going to one, punch him again because he's not normally, he's not normally a one punch knockout guy as you've seen, but he, his, his head high accuracy is very high and he'll, he'll pick it apart if can, can get his down game, his timing

Speaker 6:          02:58:02       on, on fighting junior to initiate and score the takedown early on. If he can get it, go and be successful with it, he can win that fight the APP. No one's ever been able to do that. It's an amazing thing about dosantos. People are always so afraid of fighting him on the feet problem. You, it's just like we talked about what Croak theater wasn't going to take him down if he wasn't getting in his face and slugging them out. And you know, juniors got great feet, which is tough, but a cane can do it. Came, has enough. If he, if he's smart enough and if he can get the right mindset, uh, he, he can put, he put on his back and once it starts it, it'll, it'll, it can continue. You can keep doing it right. You can't, you get that timing down and all of a sudden you pick up on that, that Shoulder Movement for that jab comes and you fake out you overhand right, and then stop and you go right into the take down or you, you pull them forward with some strikes and then he thinks it's some exchange and boom, you get them on it.

Speaker 2:          02:58:49       I think another interesting aspect of it can be if cain could take him into the fourth and fifth round because canes known for his legendary Cardio,

Speaker 6:          02:58:56       he ain't gonna. He's still not going to be successful and less he gets that takedown. Uh, that timing down. If he doesn't get that timing down, no, it won't even matter.

Speaker 2:          02:59:05       Powerful words from Josh Barnett. Ladies and gentlemen, that'll be the UFC this weekend, the 29th of December, which will be going on an mgm. You fucks Cain Velasquez vs junior dos Santos dose and it'll be happening live on paper view. All right, we will be back on a Wednesday or something. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah and whatever crime. Goofy Shit. You fall off the. We Love Ya. And I was glad the world didn't end. Oh, thanks for coming out to the end of the world show. It's fucking fantastic.
