Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hi. Four three, two, one

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       fresh from fucking dope. I want to learn the motherland. You were in the motherland for days. The mother land, now it's the motherland is sort of a one quarter of my heritage. The capital of fighting, that's for sure. [inaudible] is an Irish name. I don't know what if you know that lad, is it really? I'm one quarter Irish. Everyone out there, I'll bring Grogin out him like, what do you want me talking to him, man? Oh, can you try Rashawn shit. Fucking animals, Bro. Favorite place I've ever been. Really? Yeah, man, it does a savage. They're just, they're not even saying that they're savages. They're super friendly. So friendly. Not that people were, you know, in Australia or London or Manchester weren't, but in Dublin they were like, I was like, damn, I don't want to leave man. Look, I loved it. I was thinking yesterday when I was watching, I'm like Conor McGregor workout and like all the people, we're surrounded him while I was working out, you know when those open workouts real weird.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       Yeah. It was the only standing around hitting the bag and he's, he seems to just be doing his work, doing his normal work, you know, hitting the bag. But there's just a circle of people like right there, he's a lion. Oh Sally, that he can't even move. No, he can't like dance around. He can't back up too much. He's just right in front of that bag and he's got to pretend those people aren't there as he works in the show. Right. It's just a show to hype the fight more, I guess it is in the box. And Pierce Make Fun of them cause movement. They won't make fun of him if he lands the way he did it in that clip. Opale that's what I'm saying. When he landed that straight left, but lamb and snap Paulie's head back. I'm like, Hey Paulie, why didn't you talk about that?

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       He's says he's been on a tear. Just adds all really significant. But if a guy like Conor McGregor does that desk straight and clean and sneaky announces to m and a little off speed, like a little off speed and the initial part of the movement, then he drops it in. Bang. It's like snake like left hand, like he's getting super comfortable. If he can do that to Pauline Mala noche like whatever you say about those clips. All we know is that that's, that's what we've seen. We've only seen these little short little clips like white here. Watch this left hand, which I sneaks this in. Boom. Sign on to that left hand is fucking legit cause it's super legit. Here it is again. Why is this? Yeah Dude, that is down the pipe. Caught what you want. I mean granted that's the 12th round but still parked at the time world champion. I don't know what round though was. I don't care. I don't care. You can do that with that kind of speed to Pauline Mala Naji and time that like that. That's slut. Look, you can't sleep on him. He's got magic. Doesn't always work. That's what does know. His work is kind of new ideas has a little magic to

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       different type of magic, but that you know in that fight, Nate Diaz had the magic and it was just not Connor's nine. But the rain, which was college, no, not really. No, I don't think it was. I think the rematch was bolted. They're night. I think if you really want to look at that fight, honestly the second fight, I don't think you see a winner. The only thing that I think you could say makes Connor winter is that he dropped Nate but Napleton, but Nate was saying that he went down with punches anyway because he was hoping Connor would follow him to the ground, which may or may not be true, but it is a good strategy if you have a wind watching sport way too long that Nate's got a wicked guard we can decide like to get like when he gets clipped just to go down with it and to try to bring him to the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:03:42       Look, Fabrizio does that for resale for doom. Absolutely does that. He does. He'll do it right. Getting dropped in the face with a left hand. Well, it was a very good shot, no doubt about it. But the idea is if you get hit with a good shot, you can decide to go down. Then you can decide to bait a man three times in a row. I think you have to take it into consideration as a possibility once am I need a rolling B every time he would try it, try it. You're right. We never have, he doesn't have these tendencies. Doing all the same salary really fucked up. Nate in a fight is Josh Thompson. Josh Thompson head kicked him and every other fight. Even when he's gotten beat up like the dos Anjos fight, he's got his legs beat up and dos Anjos definitely want a decision.

Speaker 2:          00:04:25       Nate didn't get fucked up and stop stopped. He's never got his ass whooped. Josh is the only one stopped him. Yeah, but he still never got it. Like is that never gets asked what? Well, let me know what you could say. The dos Anjos fight was kind of a beating that they'll sign geosys kicking the shit out of his. He still coming forward like stood upset. He never been broke. You can say that they've never broke as well. 100% even in the Thompson fight. If they let it go, he probably would have recovered eventually if he didn't go on car. Correct. See, I think the, the real test of who's better, Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz is if they fight at 55 and the trilogy fight cause 70 it's a tossup. You know, Nate, one one, Connor one one that's whatever. They're both not fun at 70 they go to 55 you have your true I think winter there.

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       Well, you know what I mean? I like native 55 me too at her anyway, he gets real lean. Like in the Michael Johnson fight comes to destroy Johnson shredded at the man was just check, check, check, check. I'm assuming that's what he's waiting for because they've often fights. Right. But he's just waiting until that big Conor payday, I think him and his brother were smart. You know, there are huge cultural icons. They can go places and get paid and um, they're still in the mix for, you know, whatever weight class 155 or 70. If he wants to be suspended for a long, very long, just kind of pay. He's just got a pay does not. Yeah. It's not a suspension anymore. It is, is he owes them $100,000 and he won't give it so, so gangster one 65, I think he gave him like 65. You can argue that though, like remote with common are like, listen, you're suspended. You're not fighting. You got to shoot a forestry mail

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       that day as soon as shoot or bullying commercial and pays 175,000 comment. Cool. Just not find Vegas though it. Yeah, I know. No money. Uh, just a 15 second tweet and then we'll, we'll let you fight here. But you got to realize when a guy's throwing a monster energy drink and they're thrown water bottles, this is, I don't like to say this, but this is true. Does a big part of what's going on there. That is theatrical [inaudible] that's no different than pro-wrestling called cell and a fine, it's called salad. A fight and that's they're doing, they're throwing shit at each other. Sound effects. Do you think he's really trying to incite a riot like you know, occasionally, yes. Like the DC John Jones. Thank that was legit. Different animals animal. And how much of that sell the fight? The UFC was like, oh, let's just keep that in nonstop.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       And then they're like, we do not approve of this. This is ridiculous. Show it one more time. Show it again one more time. I love that though. That's clip ever. Yeah, they did. They capitalize. I don't know if they did on the John Challenge saying, you know I did cocaine a week before I beat your ass. No, they didn't. That was the greatest light. The most savage line f her ever. Jon Jones is no joke. And Jon Jones like in shape, but something approved like he did against Carmine's. Scared so scared when he kicked him in the face. My word about how the fact that he says the exact perfect thing after the fights over. Correct. About Daniel or mark about Daniel's. It's just, you know, I mean, it's still real for the first time too. Yeah, I be, he probably felt so much gratitude, you know, when I said to him like, I didn't know what I was going to say to him, but when I said to him, you made it back.

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       That's how I felt like, not just that he made it back to the title, but like you made it back from the dark lands, from life, from the back, running away from a hit and run accident with w who knows what the fuck you've got on you. You know, all that made it backs understatement. I mean, homeboy and people never stopped cheering for him. Very interesting. You know, people were mad at DC who DC, but then John Jones, his fame went up. Pregnant lady broke her arm and ran from the scene. It's crazy. I don't understand. First of all, I don't understand how you could not be a fan of DC. I don't understand it. I don't understand. There's nothing wrong with them. Like what? What would you not be a fan of? The guy's a fucking animal. He's, he won the Strikeforce heavyweight. GRANDPA defeated at him.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       I mean, he's throwing around Josh Barnett, who's a 255 pound gorilla, Daniel Cormier hoisting spiked. He's macho man. I mean, the guy gets into MMA fairly late in his career, right? Massively successful amateur wrestler gets into MMA and says running through people has a fight. The first fight in the UFC as against frank fucking mirror beats the pants off of a former UFC heavyweight champion your first fight in the UFC and beat the breaks and beats the brakes off. I mean, it wasn't satisfied and it's still whooped his ass. Yeah, I mean got the under hooking did work. It's just people like people got at him for the Anderson Silva fight that he like held. Anderson Silva [inaudible] me a little bit too. Like I can see why fans like come on man. Anderson Silva two day notice or whatever the hell it was. Come on. But Harrison front kicked him in the gut.

Speaker 1:          00:09:05       Remember that? Yeah. Her, her layers especially, you'll see 200 such a big card and there's so much hope when you don't perform, you're like, come on man. And with DC, I think the biggest thing is, and it's not his fault, he's better than everyone in the world at light heavyweight except for John Jones. So when John left and he had the title, people are like, that's fake. That's not his fault. It's not his fault. John, be mad at John. Could you imagine if you could get Daniel's brain inside rumbles body? Oh my God, that doesn't happen. Right? Isn't that interesting how that doesn't happen? It's like John John's is the closest thing to guy who's got insane talent, but he also has like, almost like dad, Darryl Elkins, Darren Elkins, rather. Um, the Darren Elkins mentality of like never quit. Like, remember when he got his arm? Hyperextended but if you don't feel bad by [inaudible], his arm was fucked up, never tapped.

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       You know, like when he fought the Gustafson find, he wasn't in shape at all and went five of five hard rounds, which is two matters, the best fight ever. And was winning the final round or about what? Against Ryan Bader who ran painters fricking good I think at times. Right? Four or five in the world doesn't even really train. They said they saw him like two days and went in there and cradle him like a baby and whooped his ass in the first round. Beat his ass. I mean it's just talking about a different animal man. Cause he's a different animal. But he's also got this mindset like he has a real champions mindset or it's like rumbled doesn't really like to fight. He's just super good at it. You don't think rumble likes it? He says he doesn't. Oh he says, he says that he says he doesn't want to fight anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:10:40       Since it was my brain trauma. He doesn't want to be rolling around with what you're saying. I got that confused with DC. No, we are rumbles. Rumble. Rumble is like the scariest guy ever at two oh five when it comes to striking, like who fucks ever been scarier than rumble? Nobody owes to Meyer Pretty Goddamn cold right now. Right? Who? He's scary right now. Technique. Just fucking, oh, he's got, he's got, he's gay. Oh, to Jimmy Madeline. He was like, you're, you're a power puncher. Do Cool. Check this out too. Interesting cat man. Interesting cat number three was e three in the world he'd, yeah, he knocked out Sir coon off. Right and knocked up Meesha and then just Merck's Jimmy Manoa in for like walked through and, and called it too. It's like I'm knocking out in the first minute or so. I'm can go do it. Jesus cry and Jimmy didn't even land anything like inside this clinch.

Speaker 1:          00:11:31       She catches him with that hard left hook. These, he's got hammers for Phis to bro, but he's like rushing it. Hi Allie. Did you know what I'm saying? Like I calculated like a John or you know like the jds where he's sitting back, he's got confidence in his power. I'm sure none of it is brick hands to your shake his hand. Oh apparently go Brock Lesnar style that does that work against the gusts spin and Jon Jones is the question out soon because I'm a fucking might be champion the world just 70 Twitter followers, light heavyweight champion of the UFC. He's like, fuck just what you do bro. You know what he's, he's, I dunno. He's changing his nickname to know time. Is that what he changed his nickname too? That's an awful short time. No time. Because like he points to his wife, he was like pointing to his watch at the time.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       That was like his move. Oh yeah, no time. No time. Like after the fight he was like pointing to his wife. She's like, this is my new nickname. I have no time. No time. He's nasty man. He's very nasty. He's got real legit 100% one punch power. And when he clipped here, wait clips guys, you can see they're like, oh shit. And he goes bananas on him. See, I think they should do Gusman Jones. Right. And then do those Demira verse DC. We'll have to see, wants to fight again. We're going to see. He said he did. You see what he does? He goes, not only I'm going to fighting him, I'm going to fight John Again.

Speaker 1:          00:12:56       Give it upset. My heart can't take it. You think you should give it up and it gets right back in there. Why not? It was a good fight up until the moment John Landa at high kick. I agree. I don't think he ever beats John. I think he might be right, but you might be a problem and then it gets even crazier. But see, I don't think he's ever going to get the fight either. I don't want to see it again. It certainly could. If he beats a few people. You certainly could because you could play clips of that fight and say, you know, he was doing very well, not fight. I think John was winning. I think John was landing more volume and he was mixing things up really well. That was ring Russ to let, that's John kind of feeling things out and then once he got comfortable, oh this is what we're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:13:34       He didn't do shit. He didn't seem ring rusty at all. I see. I smooth right from the beginning, a little smooth, but I, I do think DC's pressure and stuff like that and just getting under his feet and once he did, then he started to tee off and take over, I think. Yeah, he found his rhythm and he found DC's timing. You know, you started the, and then they settled in a little bit too. Once they get onto the Sacramento and both guys had exerted quite a bit of energy, hit each other quite a few times and that third round and then you're going to be that, that I think those DC's best chance to beat them. Now John's off to the races now. Good luck with no time. There's those de Meyer, there's guests Finn, then Brock Lesnar, yet Steve Bay, I think it goes to heavyweight.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       Who knows, man. I mean if, if they work out some sort of a deal where he fights Brock Lesnar, well, oh God. Come on Joe Course Stairwell. When he called them out at the end of the fight. I was like, oh my goodness, I saw Brad Watch Salt Brad Pitt shadow box on Instagram or you better be careful son, UFC gonna reach outside and you see a problem. You got to watch your pit would fuck cm punk show me too though. They'll Brad Pitt from snatch, you know? Also I think Brad Pitt, that guy lived with Angelina Jolie for like 10 years. No much rage. He must have Penn doesn't hate him. Was Johnny Depp just or talk of organic sustainable farming and adopting new kids. Random kids. Who the fuck

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       is this? He just wants to smash you. Just go in there, fuck him up. Smash. Just pit smashed on bitches. Just so angry at, listen to that crazy lady he lived with for decades, made him an alcoholic. Do you hear it? That was a raging alcoholic and she was a kid. He was, I love kids, but there's a new one every goddamn day. Like I can't keep a kid after kid. Oh my God. Yeah. I mean that's just my opinion. He would slap a bitch. I mean, maybe she's a wonderful person. I mean, she obviously is very charitable. Maybe she's exhausted, exhausted. That's the vibe I get. Hey Brown, she took, she had a vile of Billy Bob Thorton's blood that she carried around her neck and Billy Bob, I'm not hating on you, and she was in his fucking beautiful. I get, I can make time this then I didn't get how people make mistakes.

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       He could let around your neck. Hey, what are we going to do? We're going to live for sure. Shanique in bed for guy like him. When's the guy like him get a girl, girl like that. The universities have to like collide. That's will be some worm hole. You've got to talk to some such match shit. She puts her your blood around her neck. He's a bad motherfucker though. She was strong. Dick game. She great. Your blood around her neck, Joe. I think they both did. They were each other's blood. Yeah. That's what they're doing. They're both wearing each other's blood. That's another level. Not only that, but here's the real problem with it. You tell people about it. Yeah. It just kept to yourself, man. Telling people about it. Tell people it's dragging blood or some shit. When you tell it. It's hers. A little weird.

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       Well I think anybody that's as good an actress as she is, she's a really fucking good, amazing. She's really good. I think you have to have a good percentage of crazy. Like it's gotta be way up there in the 90s actors too though. I mean even for men like the men actors who were really good, like day to day Lewis motherfucker was a shoe cobbler for six years just to play like some 30 minute roll. It's got legs. He went full fucking cobbling working as a cobbler right now and like London assumption. No, I think he lives in Connecticut and he makes furniture or some shit. God, you never go full Louis Man. But that's cause he's, he's legit. Like that's really who we is. Like an actual artist. But that's why he's so interesting. It's like his art or what his mind goes towards. It's not dictated by finance.

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       It's not dictated by the, the, the box office success you could potentially APP. It's literally dictated by what he's interested in. He's interested in making shoes. He's just going to make shoes like you're not going to see him cast this superman like he's like, that's not his art. You know what I'm saying? Admired the shit out of that because people, we compromise all the time. People are always compromising. You're always like, you know, trying to suck up to the boss, hoping you get that raise or you know, you're compromising what you say around the office because you know you're at this level of the company ladder. These people above you that would get upset if you talk about the things we'd love. Someone just free and authentic to like what? Play Batman the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 2:          00:17:53       Fuck away from me. Yeah. Ben Affleck was like, I got this Ben Affleck's like this is perfect. This shit is perfect. Who his other homeboy as surprise play Batman. Well, a Christian Bale was the best Batman in my opinion is just his voice bothered me. Ooh, it was a little fake, right? Yeah, but it me, he got to go comic book a little bit and that's how you go comic book. But anyway, why would it change his voice? Why don't the suit, he's got to make a fake voice. You're going to make a fake voice so people don't recognize your Bruce Wayne. Yeah. Don't you at least have like some mouth thing catchphrase or some people would know that would be dope if you covered your face. Like why do we need to see the Lower Chin of Batman? First of all, I don't think that's a good idea for protective measures. He lead you.

Speaker 2:          00:18:37       You have a white button where the most vulnerable part of your faces. Strange. Like if I came in here and yeah, what's that? If I came in here to bat suit on, if you had the Batman seat, I'd like, oh that's Joe. You know what I'm saying? Like it's not a very good fucking Cobra. The Chin part is terrible because like that's the part you'd want to punch and it would be like so white. It's like if you're in a fight with that man, just shoot for the chin. You can't miss it. It's like if you're, if you're hitting focus pads, he gave his to like looking at this one spot. It's like you have camouflage on everywhere. No spot. You get knocked down.

Speaker 2:          00:19:15       You looked at it. I ever like, you're going to not protect the most volatile. How about just open, open though? Nose part up to like, you knows get smashed. That's so crazy. That's so strange. Why don't they, I mean do they really have to have that same suit? Look this up? I don't know. No one's ever figured it out until us. It's like Bruce Wayne from Batman in the fucking like Dan and Dan and none the Batman. At least he didn't have like a protective suit on Adam last night. You just had that hanging over his eyes. He was just in disguise like this Batman Index, this Batman is gotten to the point where he's in his arm. Basically. It was an armored suit. Right. And meanwhile he doesn't cover his face. Oh, it was superman. You covered a little bit of it. He's going to see, he's basically a night there.

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       He want, he's going to war. But Superman. Do you know how God damn stupid data's and doing work? You kind of, what I watch it kind of looked to SAS superman. It's from another planet. He can fly so fast. He makes the world spin backwards. He makes time, goes backwards. He's a master of time. He can cut things in half with his eyeballs. He's got laser, she's out a drive. Pick his dumb ass up and carry me as high as he wants and let them go. Yeah. Movies over could bring you to the sun. Yes. Throw you into the sun. You fucking talking about Hollywood shit on my face. How, how crazy is that? The idea that gravity is so dense on Superman's world that when he comes to earth he can fly and then the atmosphere is so different than his body's bulletproof, but he looks just like us.

Speaker 2:          00:20:51       But the atmosphere wasn't, people don't understand if you went somewhere and if you're like from Earth, right and then you go to somewhere that has like less gravity like space, like those guys to go to the space station, they are fucked up after a year. Like it doesn't make them stronger. It makes them weaker, weaker, their bones shrink. Like they'd come back man. And they had their bones atrophy. Like they lose bone density, they come back and they're healthy. That's why there's this only surmount of time you can be there. Right. I think the longest is right over a year. Yeah. They've, I think they've like hit the new record. I think I got hit the new record but I had um, Cham what is his name? Commander Chris Hadfield had him on the podcast. He was fascinating and he was describing what it was like coming back from how long was he up there for?

Speaker 2:          00:21:42       I think it was a year. Right? You just came in to clicking like Schmiegel or he just said when you land he said 879 gasp. Oh my goodness. I'm rushing up there. He's been for five missions. Okay. Those Russian came, the man has spent the most time and space when he surpassed. So that's like overall time ever. That guy just keeps going to space 2.2 years overseas. Like six trips though. That too is trying to get away from his wife. He fat. That's five years. Yeah. Russians, it you to take it another level, don't they? I think you'd have to say like what's the longest space mission or something consecutive 15 days the most. Huh. But that was 2015 I believe commander Hatfield was after that. Still not dose time. I might not be right about that, but either way. Fucking a hundred days shit from what I want to do a hundred days in the woods.

Speaker 2:          00:22:32       Dude, I don't want to 10 days on the road, 10 days. I was super lonely. I felt like I was in space. Yeah, we were talking about that. Like you've got to bring friends. Big, big part of it and it's good for the friends too. It's a, you know, get guys a Gig like that where they can open up for you in front of a packed house. That's cool. Venues also warm up. The crowd liked I'm going out to eat just like, which is fine, you know? You know when, the only time I ever did that in the last like 10 years was when I was helping Collin out when a warm the crowd up for Collins and I was like this is so weird to go on stage. Just go onstage and say hi. Not have someone in front of you. But it's a good, it's good exercise.

Speaker 2:          00:23:12       Yeah. Cause you got to get them into, you know I brought me right back to how it, when I used to do it, it was like right away start thinking about how I, when I first started out, that's most of the shows that we can be the opening act like in Dublin doing a shot two in the afternoon. It was crazy. I mean just crazy man. But the why'd you guys do it like that? That's a, that we, they booked on such short notice. That's the way I'd do that too. And I do another one at uh, like seven. Oh Wow. That's just the way they wanted to do it. Cause I'll have like an how did you get away from those savages after the show's over? I had stayed. I like I, I did a meet and greet with everyone and then they

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       bounced. They were like, Hey, let's get a pint. I'm like, which one? Like up there. I'm like, see you there. And not just like, chill. I drank so much. Guinness is ridiculous. They'll put you down. I loved it, man. Loved it. Yeah, there it's a different world over there. It really is Ireland, England, you know, um, they, they have a long history of tradition that we don't really understand, you know, just, just what their culture's like that, you know, the language and the history. You go over there, you're like, oh, this pub is 700 years old. Like what? Yeah. I went to, it was supposed to be the oldest pub in Ireland and there was bullet holes from fighting, you know, the rebels. Wow. They were in there and his family owned since day one. And the, the owner was this dude who is old as fuck now, but he was born and raised upstairs.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       He lives there now. He's the only one still alive. We're, they're just all night with Patty Hooligan. It was great. It was great. It was so awesome. Just sipping. Wow. Eating Chris Shit, my pants afterwards. But in the crisps or potato chips, right? Yeah. I call him Chris. I'm from the you call football, football or soccer. I see American football cause I have a big day. Talked about football and go American flag. Otherwise you're screwed. You're superstar. But you know what's best for me. Joe Is like I did, uh, what was it, like 10 shows and uh, four days or something. Like 10 shows in five days or something like that. And I wish I could do it more here. It's just the wraps for me. Reps. Oh yeah, that's what we're, we're talking about comedy club. Weekends are so good, so good. Like, uh, when I did a salt lake, Salt Lake City, when I did a, a wise guys, I was like, man, you too.

Speaker 1:          00:25:18       I really get to feel it again. Like what it's like to do for one hour shows in a weekend. It's like he gets leu timing down and then tag lines. They started like adding on. He started coming up with new ideas to, what is it about coffee that gives you flam even just fucking really, this is just a cold brew, a caveman cold brew and those nitrile cropping or dairy or anything. I'm always ready to cough or clear my throat and it's annoying. I feel like it's an older thing. Nah Man, it's always been that way with me. With Cox, it's an older thing. Hold guys, get all Fleming's, get my cane. I drink a shit load of coffee and my voice is good. You know when it is for whatever weird reason when like if a guest is talking, like if you've got a good story and your story goes on for a few minutes and then I don't talk for awhile, it all builds up.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       You have to jump and secret. Yeah. Cali. So He's trying to avoid coffee. I told county, you need this, you need to get your fucking throat checked out. I mean, he's been doing it since I've known him. We just didn't hostile stop AIDS sucking dicks. I'm so about football, man, I wanted to ask you about this because uh, we were talking recently about this guy who were tired super young. He's like 26, right? Some dude just retired from the NFL. Yeah, I'm dying, Joe. Is that what you're asking? No, no. What I'm asking is like, you as a guy who's played football and it's a guy who sees all this, uh, the shit that's coming out now, do you think there's going to be a change in the game? Do you think he's going to be like less people that are signing up for it?

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       That that's what they say and they say like with the youth leagues now, they're like, oh, we're teaching them how to hit proper. But it's like there's no such thing. There's no, it's, it's not real. Like that's a fun campaign and stuff like that. But you know, it is America ever gonna get rid of football because CT, no man, I just, it's part of the game. It's literally part of the game. You know? Wait, wait till, wait till the UFC numbers come out. You're going to be surprised. I have friends now. I talked to him like, oh my God, man, do you not realize what's going on here? And so once that comes out, now we know it with boxing and mixed martial arts, like of course there's going to be brain trauma guys getting punched in the head with football. People are like, what?

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       But if it's literally part of the game, it's just, it is what it is. Now is the juice worth the squeeze and football? The argument is it depends for your health. If you're coming from nothing and it pays for your college, you make you know, $40 million. Your family, your family, their family set for life. God, that juice might be worth the squeeze depending how bad you're going to have it, if you can get to that level. Correct. Yeah. I mean there's probably a lot of guys who wash out. I know what to more likely than not, they watch out. Yeah, I knew I'd do who washed out and he was really fucked up the point where like he was seeing shit there wasn't there. He would go out into the yard and start talking to himself. It's such a bummer man. Everyone responds different. But they say the biggest thing, and you know, I guess it's the biggest thing because I played football since I was what, six years old.

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       But when you're young hitting when you're young heading, it's just like you shouldn't hit until, you know, they say probably to high school, but if you don't hit to you're in high school, you're going to get left behind. You know what's interesting about that is that there's a real good argument when it comes to striking that if you can teach kids how to play fight when they're young, just make sure they play fight, you know? You know, you don't want him to like go on a war, teach and be like that. The the quick way to teach them, it teaches them how to play, fight striking when they're young. Like do like Thai style kickboxing or you know like just where you're boxing but you're not hitting too hard because they're not going to hit each other art anyway. Right. They can't, they don't hit that hard.

Speaker 1:          00:28:52       And then on top of that, teach them to not hit harder off and did teach him to like be real solid on technique. Then they, they're super customed to the movements of striking and then you get them to a position when they were like 16, 18, they've been boxing her whole fucking life and their movements are like fully ingrained to the point where an average athlete coming into it at a later age without all those like super fine tuned, ingrained in you while you were growing up and developing. You almost don't have a chance, you know, like when he gets to like a Roy Jones Jr and his prime level for sure. You know, if you're like an average athlete who learns boxing at 26, and then you, uh, at 30 have to box Roy Jones, I mean, good, enjoy that. Good fucking luck. I don't care what kind of athlete you are.

Speaker 1:          00:29:38       Good. Doesn't matter. Fucking lock. Yeah. And some people will make that argument with, you know, Floyd Mayweather, they said, listen, his uncle, his dad he's been doing since he was, what, six. He's the best argument, the best argument, the best argument, who he never gets hit. It's been hit in a professional career that spanned 49 fights. He's been hitting maybe hard seven or eight times true. The only, and there's a few x factors in the, in this fight. The only kind of thing that gives people hope if you're on team MMA or team Connor, which is not MMA for suboxone, but if your team, Connor is these x factors of Floyd's had two years off, right? He said two years off, but in the past he's taken time off and comes back better, but he is 40 and so forth. That has to be something, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       And the other thing, why is he doing it? He's, he do it for money. What's is do it for attention? Why is he coming back to get to 50? And then, uh, they di eight ounce gloves, which they officially approved today. Eight ounce gloves is a huge, huge advance for Connor. And I think, man, it's all, it's all interesting. Men call x factors, right? Like we don't really choose to be honest. No one really knows. I think I have an idea what I think's going to happen, but no one knows. But, and that's why I think the, the footage of Connor sparring poly is such a big deal because people, oh shit, no, he can actually box. And I even think Dana on the Fertittas who were there watching go, uh, we actually got something here and that's why it was such a big deal because I think everyone's like, all right, Connor MMA, he's good.

Speaker 1:          00:31:00       I've seen him move around. I'm playing this, this dude as far as box. And he's saying, you've got some problems, isn't he the best all time problems. Who knows what, what kind of training and Pauli been doing before that fight? Like how, what kind of shape was he in? Non Not in 12 round shape, you know? And Paul, he just got off the plane. Why did he do 12 rounds? Why do you do that? Right. But he had, he been training, he, uh, he got word from Conner's team that they're going to use them. So he started to train some but not like, it's not like he was getting ready for a fight fight, you know, so that's what he said. He goes, man, you know, for me to go 12 rounds was tough. Like I wasn't expecting to all 12 rounds because the first day they used to him, I think he said he only did six or eight rounds and then he was like, oh, we're going to spar tomorrow morning.

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       I'll get in better shape. Stuff like that. Get used to the fighting shape and they didn't use them. Then he flew to, uh, cover the, uh, Mikey Garcia, uh, uh, Broner fight and then came back and he was fresh off the plane and then he sparked 12 rounds. So he's like, they just did me dirty man. That's his whole thing. His, his feelings are hurt. He's like, why the, why would they do that? Man, I was here to help them. What they did that, that's the kind of help they want it. They just want to kind of help that he didn't want to give, they wanted to kind of help where Connor beats the fuck out of a world champ. Correct. And that's what Connor said though. Like in college defense when they go, you're bringing pollyannas. Yeah, I'm bringing it. He said it's on showtime during the media scrum.

Speaker 1:          00:32:16       He goes, yeah, I'm bringing him in to fuck him up. And I think Polly thought, oh that, yeah, he goes, he goes, yeah, I'm going to bring him in and fucked him up. Word for word that's on, that's on a document that's document. So then he gets it and goes, oh, we'll spar and be all good. But remember six months prior to this Paul, he goes, I could beat Conor with one hand tied behind my back. I was like a baby elephant. He's stores. That was a guy, man. Oh he said that. Oops. But he thought it was just hyping the fight. You know, he's not doing sparring, be like boys, but it just didn't happen. Like Connor's liberty there just to prove a point. Well, he is a very important point to prove before a giant fight like that. Like that video alone is probably worth, who knows how many thousands of hundreds of thousands of buys.

Speaker 1:          00:32:58       I'm priceless. Priceless. That's worth so much money. I mean how many more people, a lot of people were going to buy the fight anyway, but how many more people are going to buy the fight now that you see common land in that straight left and then drop in Paul and Paul, he said is it pushed down? And you could see that it's not a push down. I mean it's just not, if you get pushed down like that, you probably can cost already. Yeah. If your balance is off. I see what that's so bad. Like he was saying something about him getting grabbed on the back of the head. He could watch it, watch the knockdown Polly Polly saying that it's dirty and he didn't get that. I get that. But that they signed up. It's a fight. But the other thing is poly saying, you know, and he goes take, what do you want from the videos? But I think Khan and his team and Dana fucked up putting this out. Cause now, now Floyd Mayweather, the team knows this is the salary fights. Like this is the dirty stuff he does so they can warn them that dirty their hands getting inboxing that sturdy. You can get away with it, but that's frowned upon. It's going to happen. It was rabbit punches, but that the boy is going to do that. So this, this part right here. Gimme some volume on that so you can hear that.

Speaker 3:          00:34:04       He's hitting them hard man.

Speaker 1:          00:34:08       Okay. Yeah. He hits him with a straight left that's clean and then it looks like he's wobbled and he hit some of the right hand afterwards. Like play that part one more time when it goes down like you can't, I don't see an argument. I've tried to look at it a little push down. I don't see it. I don't see it. This is the beginning part then. That's a legit ref by the way. Yeah. Yeah. Joe Cortez, super legit.

Speaker 3:          00:34:33       Oh did, he's beating the shit out of them.

Speaker 1:          00:34:42       Okay. I don't give a fuck what anybody says. Like, if he can land those combinations on Pauline melon, RG like that at any point in life that is working. But yeah, man, he's about, to me that validates counter. But at the same time and Polly's defense, you know, nine 12 round fight shape, he's exhausted. I get all that, but still punched it and never done that. Yeah, he messed up. He must've underestimated them. You know, I had uh, uh, uh, Andre Berto on my show and he's supposed to help calm her out and he's like, I ain't going up there. And he's a, he's a, he's good friends with kind of him. Connor did Rehab together. He's like, no, I'm not going up there, man. He goes, just because he had a good point. He goes, let's say I go up there and help Connor. And for whatever reason he doesn't think he's going to win because let's say he blasts away me within the face.

Speaker 1:          00:35:28       I'm gonna get so much hate from the boxing world. Like it's a fraternity man. And he's like, in the way he did Pauli like, we just, we can't do it, man. He goes, I wish them the best, but I'm not going to help them. Well, also think that if he's peaking and he's in full fight shape and then making you fight 12 rounds, I mean that's when you're in the gym and you're sparring 12 rounds done. Isn't that unusual that you get one guy to barks 12 rounds with you? Oh, no, no, no, no. It was designed for Paul. You get beat up, but then I feel like, uh, you know Paul, he's a team player. If, I don't know if you've ever met Paul, he loves you, but if you ever met Paul, he like, I feel like he's such a good guidance. Say anything.

Speaker 1:          00:36:00       Listen, if you brought me in to do anything I have had guys off for wanting me to help him with camps, I turn it down and you're like, hey, we need to go five five that ain't happening. I'll give you one round, two rounds for your, for the best condition. Usually do a shark tank is Joe bringing fresh guys for different looks and push you harder. So this is just a showcase of Connor's abilities at Paulie's expense. Yup. I like Paul. He's a commentator. I think he's one of his best in the world. He's really, really good. And he offers like real, legitimate insight. He's vitally, really good to think that he got rocked and doesn't deserve, remember how this went? Like did he think that he meet bring, maybe did think that he got pushed down? No, I it again, I think it's combination of both.

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       I think, you know, Polly had one summer and he even says, he goes, I want some rounds Koller one somewhere. You know, I like to see it all right. Me Too. And the UFC said they're gonna release it after the fight, which is that, that's going to be the real test is going to be real tested. What? Cause Dana said it was a one sided beat down. Yeah. It was like he was asked what for 12 rounds, which I don't believe that. What if it's true? Uh, you, you, you gotta go with what Polly did say happened and then what you see happened. I think it's combination of both. I really do. I think, again, I think it's people were like, Yo, you know, everyone's on this Connor wagon, especially in the UFC. Dana, that's his golden boy. Right? And I think we knew Conor could box, but then when you see him do it against Paul, you're like, oh shit.

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       And so even I bet when we watch the tape where I'm like, oh damn, Connor did pretty well. I don't think he beat the shit out Pauline for 12 rents. I think towards the end he probably like, you see that that gap, that hole, obviously, listen, this has obviously been very valuable. If there were more moments like this, don't you think they would leak those two? Correct. There'd be everywhere. I mean they're saying they don't want him to see what Connor's working on. Okay. Just show us a mock punches that landed. Just give me like what it was Mike Tyson Siki second highlights to show me a few bap bap, bap. Bap. Bap. Bap. Bap. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you don't have to like show all of its patterns, but how well did this hype that like this is priceless giant. And now Paulie, you know you have this huge soap opera in box and going right now.

Speaker 1:          00:37:56       Polly's a main character now. So Paul, he might have to fight Conor if Floyd and Floyd and even had Floyd and Connor, if Floyd beats Conor and then Paul, he can say, look, I want my shot at him. You know you, you talked a lot of shit and I didn't get in shape. If you're not relaxed, the play, it's only, it's only the play. If Connor has a good showing, even if you live in the decision, as long as it gets showing right, then you do McGregor promotions against Polly Mellen Naji and I'll buying that shit. The only way. Fighting Khabib, Tony Ferguson, all that elbow just Jitsu Shit. Nah, we are putting on these eight ounces, go 12 rounds

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       and make some, I need some serious money. That's a lot of people think on their fight MMA again. I mean he's gonna make $100 million from this fight. Yeah, probably more. That's the sponsors. Yeah, that's a lot of money. That's scrooge. Mcduck rich. That's, that's we go and sizzler. [inaudible]. It has a son, you know, he's a smart guy. I think the play would, and I know a lot of, you'll see people like that because he never fight or shop. I get that. Give any UFC fighter $100 million. They're both thrown up to C's going spach and see ya. This is way too hard of a life. Hundred Mil. He's even satin sheets and I can go fight Polly for another whatever, 50 mill, probably of my own money or, or I'll go fight Nate Diaz and the trilogy, 90% or more. Connor Mcgregor versus Floyd Mayweather money man says notorious will lose 90% of his $75 million payday if he's disqualified.

Speaker 2:          00:39:28       Yeah, yeah, I know that. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's, that's, if he doesn't know my may move on him and he won't be us up all the time. Can you tell a superman punch spinning punch? I'm like, get out of my face. The absolutely not. You can't, it's just caddy can throw spinning back fist though. Whoa. Magic that ship some Gut, some gentlemen rules for guts. You imagine now if, if Floyd said, uh, you could throw elbows, I'm surprised he has an eight ounce gloves, will do whatever you want to do. Let's do this. Let's do this. You imagine and you get elbows and he gets thrown. One kick around and the guy can clinch and throw elbows from the clench. Do you ever see that? The sequence where Jordan me and knocked out Cyborg and strike force. Oh my oldest nasty. He's one of the nastiest, nastiest sequences of standing elbows.

Speaker 2:          00:40:12       Holes like, like a fucking seminar on how to land a standing elbow. The most vicious elbow hall time. Cyborg is taking some shots to the dome. Dude, he got from my Cavedin page, the knee k page, kill and die. He did God damn near killed him. I mean yet to have all constructive. Oh, he didn't like, he basically had to put like mesh wiring all over his face. Now he's a superhero and he said he was going to fight again and then he change his mind. Yeah. Let's not do that though. Huh? I mean, who knows how his dome works right now. I mean, after you get hit like that and you're set goal pours in poor to very poor. Who knows? Everyone's different. It won't change the different, here it is right here. Look at this. He hits him with a liver shot, a left right?

Speaker 2:          00:40:57       Doesn't happen till they get to the kitchen here. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I mean, look at that. I mean, come on man. Who's the rays? Hit Him with like 13 fucking straight elbows to the head. Did you think they stopped the CIF? Joan's early? I mean late. Yes. Yes. Right? Yes. Yeah. I think you're, you know, like you're giving the guy the best chance he can. Your John McCarthy, you know how tough he is. John's the best in the world too. So they're size two punches too late. Yeah. Well, and you kind of three also like the

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       delayed effect, that head kick. I get head kicked and you see his like legs buckle and he's wobbling around and then when he goes down up against the cage, I mean it wasn't like a real significant thing that ha, he's like his legs weren't working right? No. It's game over. Like the game's over there was already hurt bad and then John Jumps on top of them. It's just wailing on him. You, he could've stopped at one or two punches earlier, but you know in his eyes, what if DC recovers? What if he rolls over? Gets to guard. What if he holds on to John? I believe his lived to fight another day. I agree with you too. I totally agree with you, but I'm just looking at it from John's point. I did it. I don't like criticizing giants. She's like, man, I thought that was too late.

Speaker 1:          00:42:11       A lot of people thought that was too. Yeah, it's tough to watch with DCM and my thing with DC and you talked about and coming back, he's, you know, he's, what is he, 39 38 39 he has a great job with the UFC as far as UFC tonight. Right. He's kind of becoming that. The guy you'll see tonight, he's doing commentating. We do. He's traveling all around now. He's great at commentary. You know? Does he ever be John? I don't think so. So what are you going to do? Fight Gustin again, those, the know, I don't know what his pay is, but you know, at some point, you know, health has to take into account with this. Yeah. The Gustafson fight was a grueling five round fight. You know, I remember there was a very, very, very good for us. It's been test fucking close man.

Speaker 1:          00:42:49       It's better now than ever before. He too. That's why I want to see him and John Ken's glow over. I was like, Jesus Christ looked amazing and the combinations he was landing that hazing, that whipped like upper cut from the outside. See the thing about him is he's the only guy that can match John for distance and reach size. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, no one else is like him, not even close. And Gustafson is also more mobile than John. Like he's, John is like very creative, mixes things up more. But Gustafson is more like bouncing around better footwork and his better footwork for sure. Yeah. He's very agile and he's also the first guy to ever Atlanta take town on John. Yes. And I think he's better. I think he's better now that he wants then we too. That'd be, that'd be a great fight. Fuck yeah, that would be, you know, they were asking John how about John was on Good Morning America getting interviewed by Michael Strahan.

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       Good Lord to things change. Wow. Yeah. Right. So he's on Good Morning America and the ask them about what's next. And he talked about, you know, he'd like to fight Brock. Like that's always been kind of his thing. And Connor kind of set that with the super fights. But you know, Brock can't fight too. I think whatever it has, 18 months or some shit, I'm sure it was slipping in the back door. So I'm shit like what's, what's this juice to the gills? I'd still watch it. Um, so they talked to about Gus fin. They go, what about mass square garden? And he was not happening cause they weren't taxed me another 10% of fight in New York. So He's like, I won't find maths work on. Wow. I know. I feel like you'll see like fuck your 10% here, just finding a squirt gun. Let's figure this out. Take a little extra pieces of the mighty mass. Give us something to perhaps they might even say no, give me that. Would if John Put uh, uh, uh, no steroid test clause, I Guy Brock, oh, take your shit. Fuck you do your shit. I'm gonna do my copay and you know, we missed and I'd be up all night long. No

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       drug test. Cause that's all talking about doing like Dubai or some shit. But if he just says, tell him, look, I don't give a fuck what you do, I'm going to beat your ass. And then Brock's gotta go, Oh my God. It's like full bane. Sheth drug gets up to two 90 cuts down at two 65 I don't know if John could fuck with that. I don't, that's a scary dude. Mccain fucked up backup, you know King County. But he did have the stomach issue. Diverticulitis, right ovary muscle fucked him up when he was being broked. Well that was a crazy fight for him to take after recovering from surgery where he got 12 inches of his colon removed and we talk in Uber Ring. Yeah, that was ubering to the man's got like a straight up murder when he was two 65 kicked in the gut.

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       He just had surgery there. Hit that. Obering see that. It's like, he's like one of the best arguments for no testing. He's still kind of killing it with the old too. He's great, but it's a different Overeem like this Overeem the Ha, the heavyweight grom pre k one heavyweight Grand Prix Overeem. There's never been a fight like that before. Like look at this size. They're never going to see that again ever. In the UFC. Physiques he was so jacked. They look like giant Phil Heath. Like you're never going to see these two again and kicked like that and he's just all over him. Brought to the gut down. He's got some of the best knees in the businessmen. Super good technique, which just I, I missed this Overeem where he was just dying. People with power. You'll never see the, the, the Overeem now that can be dumb.

Speaker 2:          00:46:15       Fucking has been kicked to the gut. The Overeem now that uh, his steroid free. Like he, he, he does that move where he runs a lei steroid over him. Never ran saying like on steroids. [inaudible] good luck in miss step an inch bat. Now he's clean. That fuckers sprinting, remedy fought Todd Duffy and dream. Do you ever see that fight? I trained Tom for that fight and I suppose to corner him. Todd Duffy was super promising before that fight. We'll talk took on short notice. I don't do it. I wouldn't be broke. Got To fight who over him dream dough. I don't do that. Listen, you have a lot of talent. You could be huge. This is not the way to get huge. She gets a bad idea. Alliterated in Japan with short notice Japan. What is it about calling people like a week before the fight going? What are you up to Saturday?

Speaker 2:          00:47:13       All advantages for it, for the home team then, and wasn't this post UFC Duffy because he had that UFC fight where he won like it was one of the fastest fights ever. One out with a jab in seconds, breath and peace to him. Hey. Yeah, rest in peace to anguish. Terrible, terrible story. Duffy's Gigi Jack too. He was super jacked. So talented. I'll really, really talented stupid. He goes in there and he fights. Overeem ad is most Overeem ever. They'll look at it and I'm confident is, yeah, it's like a death sentence. He was a monster back then. And then when you think about him, like bordering on both sports, right? He's like k one grand Prix champions still fighting MMA. It's all again the same time period. And his striking is just off the charts because of it and you can't take him down. Yeah. So Duffy just went after him [inaudible] and everything.

Speaker 2:          00:48:14       Boom. He gets cuts the mood for Duffy though. Yeah, it is a move. He gets old. The body shot body gets Duffy here that you write here about. I'm not backing up to look. It just boomed so much power forward. Right hand. Left hand running from [inaudible]. He wasn't running. No. Did his thought process. Now I'm a fucking yeah. Slides out. Delay. Well, he's also older and he's taken more punishment to you. Gotta think though. Knockouts that he's had just in the UFC. Steve Bay knocked him unconscious. Um, Travis Browne knocked him unconscious a while ago. Yeah. Yeah. I mean there's been how many, how many people knocked him out? He has his more knocked out losses. Anyone in the EOC? Yeah. Um, brothel knocked him out. Rothwell Steve Bay. He beat JDF didn't. Yes, he did. He knocked him out. He didn't lens a couple of issues. Yeah, but I'm trying to think of other fights that he's had.

Speaker 2:          00:49:07       I'll tell you what I'd love to see Overeem versa. Your boyfriends, you know. Oh my God. I would love to send it to says jds coming up, but oh, that's right. Big Foot Silva knocked him out too. Oh that big foot civil one was rough. That was a rough one. It was real rough cause he was standing up and big foot Tito on. I'm just Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding. But then look at him. He merged dude's share of Nelson JDS or Lawsky loses Steve Bay for the title. This true fight was brutal. No, that Mark Hunt fight was rough. The flat road market market's fine again. It's right in that Russian dues, right? Like 10 or something. Yeah. Yeah. He's fighting a isn't that a, is that in Australia? Yeah. Australia and New Zealand one [inaudible] still good move man. You have a fucking Mark Hunt fight New Zealand. He's a huge draw.

Speaker 2:          00:49:55       Oh my God. Gigantic Sydney to Boris fighter man. Soon to Boris. Like guts. Sneaky, sneaky left high kick Judy's Russians. And though that that whole area, they might fuck you there had taken over box and they're slowly creeping in. MMA. How about it could be, I know what's going on with him. Well he got Tony First and Kevin Lino fight for the interim title. They just don't think can be, can make the weight. I don't know what's going on. They asked him to fight, right? And he was like, no, I need more time. It's just the boats passing them by more time. What's, it must be injured. Look Tiramisu. I Dunno. Terribly.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       And I like could be such a talent, but like, it's so frustrating. I fucking love Tiramisu. Oh, I get it. Could be no, it's like when you don't, you know, you shouldn't be eating this, but you're like, fuck it. Let's get dessert. If I go, what? Do you have dessert. And they go, well, we have world famous Tiramisu. Bring that. Oh, then you got some coffee with it. A double espresso, please. I gotcha. I get it. I get it. They don't have the, here's the thing, my man campaigns, uh, runs these ultra marathons every year. Last year he ran the big foot, 2000 or 200. It's two oh five, 205 miles. And this year he's running this Moab one 234 miles. He cuts down from 180 pounds, which is what he weighs normally. He's down to one 60 now. Jesus, he know how he does it. He works out and burns off more calories than eats.

Speaker 1:          00:51:22       That's it. But then, and he feels good doing it. Yeah. He'll bike burn off 3000 calories. Eat 2000 I mean if he look different though, if he can do it, if he can do that then Khabib can do that too. They can all do that. All you have to do is just work hard, do a lot of fucking cardio, put a lot of hours in training and eat less than you're eating. Here's the thing though. You'll shrink, you'll shrink. Yeah. That's it's science. But here's the thing, you can hire someone to do that to make sure you make that weight. Well, he's also look a very strict Muslim and so he, he celebrates Ramadan. Yeah. Which makes it a real issue for guys to fight. Although someone just did that in the UFC, um, Ramadan. Yeah. And got through it but through Ramadan. But his nickname is, remember the name Billao Mohamad Mohamad went through Ramadan while he was training.

Speaker 1:          00:52:20       He just did it very smart. And he scheduled is training for after his meal. A lot of Batta. Yeah. And he fought great with Khabib though. It's like, you know, at 55 kind of, but cluster fuck there and he's just getting left in the dust. I think it's his Bot I think is real issues with his body from losing those amounts of weight. Let's boil it and listen, I love Ak and they've done, uh, you know, I think, um, you know crazy. Bob Cook should belongs in the UFC hall of Fame Hall of fame. He's a straight up genius. Him and Javier. Yeah, but those boys, I don't know what's going on there with Kane. You know, you've got the, you know, well, you know what it is for awhile. Here's what I think it is. You got at the top level of that. You have to have the best, first of all, arguably the best heavy weight ever and cane.

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       And then he got one of the best light heavyweights ever and Daniel and they're going to war all the time. But Thompson and, but, and Luke Rockhold in the mix too. And they also, you only have a certain amount of years of being able to do that. So then he, she Keynes body breaking down. I mean you can't just attribute that only to his training there because there's some questionable weightlifting videos of him online. The dead lift. Yeah. Well it's, it's not even a dead man. It's like he's doing a kettle bell swing with like shit form and they're doing high reps of all kinds of weird shit. I got saw a lot like Steve Maxwell saw and he was furious. But the thing is a lot of them and make guys, if they don't come from a, like a football background in most of them you don't see lift like that to be honest.

Speaker 1:          00:53:42       Well, it's problem was he had a trainer and the people were feeling like the trainer was doing a shit job. But yeah, I mean, yeah, 100% I mean as far as naming injuries and delays in fights on eight k but I think, and it's not up to them. I think you, again, like you were saying, you have the toughest guys in the world competing every day. You have Khabib, you have all these guys and things are going to happen. I think there's two different schools of thought, and I don't know who's right. There's a school of thought where you just fucking go in there and you'd go to war all the time and the cream rises to the top and you get hardened by the combat and you come out of it, the best fighter in the 1997, you know what, it was cane for a while, right?

Speaker 1:          00:54:18       Until all these injuries started piling up. But I think there's another way of looking at it. Well, there's two different other ways of looking at it. There's the, and when you get to a Connor situation, then you get a super camp. It's designed around you, and then you get these people who are working with you on various aspects of your game. You're sparring partners or plan accordingly. There's a bunch of people that you work with that, you know are their goal is to get you better for this fight. And I would say GSPs one who really started that for sure. For us. A hobby. Yeah. Yeah. And, um, I think these guys that are doing this today, you know, it's like how do you do it? Do you do it the old school way, which has always been proven. You can make some tough motherfuckers that way.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       Or do you do at the att way when you have this gigantic program where you have all world class coaches and athletes and you're putting together all these people and you know, I mean you just have a giant super team look at their roster too. But again, but you know, not that Javier didn't have a competition background, but the reason why t so good and they're, they're killing it with a Yolana Jen, Jen, check with fucking Amanda Nunez. All their big athletes. Mike Brown, right? He's been there. He's done it. He's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. To me, you know, he definitely top three in the boreal, the boreal too. But Mike Brown really, he's only, he's focused on Yolana and Amanda Nunez and he's focusing because he's been there, he's done those meathead days. Things going, we need to focus more on this. So when you have someone, even team Alpha Male, I don't have a ton of injuries really.

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       Granted Cody Garbrandt seven his things, but Uriah faber, he's been through it. So you need these younger guys who have been through it who are going to take control, who are saying, listen, we can't be Vander Lee Silverman. This isn't meant the top team, this ain't working in football. Same Way like Jim Hart at Michigan, they don't hit, he goes, if you don't have to hit at this level, you're not going to make it. Right. They only hit on game days when it counts. Right. So you see this kind of trend happening with people who've been through it before, like a cowboy cowboy hardly respires anymore. Yeah, he does mostly drills. Mitt work, you know it your own too. Like you see this kind of guy that's like, man, I can't begin beat up in training anymore more. It doesn't make sense. God Damn. Especially at heavyweight, you know, big guys the size of Mitch around giving each other brain damage, bad idea, terrible that I can only do it so many times.

Speaker 1:          00:56:33       And I think when you see a guy like Conor with all the different experimenting that he does with like weird movements, Tufts with that ido portal guy like rights and shit. Even the weird shit that he does, like when you see him like switching stances in the, in the rings switching stances, like a taekwondo guy, like he's in a taekwondo tournament. If he all that weird shit, if he can do shit like that, the Floyd, all that stuff that he's never seen before. Sideways stance, you know, moving more like a karate fighter. He's going to come out more karate than people are expecting us. I as poly, you know, I said, you know Polly has his issues with and I'm like, yeah, that's terrible. But how was, how was this, was it as awkward as I'm predicting cause yeah, no, Carter goes, it goes in and get starch.

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       My time, I'm out showtime. That's my time. Have a good night. You know what I'm saying? Like I look like an asshole. But he was saying, he was like, Nah man, he gets even more awkward than I than I thought. Like, it's, it's tough to deal with. He said one time it has palm up like this. Yeah. Like, like Leo Machida Shit. Oh, it's definitely going to do that. And it plays like, I have no idea who that is. I'm like look him up. He doesn't know who the auto Machida's. How dare, how daring Polly, how dare you. He knows Jujitsu. That was like my morse prediction of all time. Welcome to the MACHITA era. Probably my worst predictions. Oh, there was a Machida era. No, not like that. Like he lost right away after that we murked show guns. Right. Murked Rashad. Well he didn't Merch Shogun shogun knocked him out.

Speaker 1:          00:57:55       Oh that's right. Get lost him. But they had that back and forth. Right. Well he ended up or shot. He fucked up or shot knowing the title 10 title. Who beat him right after that and then John crushed him. And then once John crush him crush his dreams. Yeah. And then it drops down to 85 great. Against Munoz. There was a Leo Machida like when we say the air, I mean yeah, there was still, but I try to use the game. He definitely changed a lot, but I thought he was going to go on a crazy run man. So as we got there John Jones to to to do, uh oh he lets her rampage but that had to go back a little bit more. Go back a little bit more. So where does, where does the Rashad fight? Okay, so he fought Rashad and then he fought.

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       That's what it is. He fought shogun next, but he should have lost that fight and he won, but still yet a lot and then show you lots of two years. So remember he beat dealer that and that's real Tito Ortiz. Merck Thiago Silva. At the time Thiago Silva was f straight savage destroys Rashad. Then he ekes by Shogun. What he meant when he jumped in front, kicked Randy in the face and knocked out. Randy's too. That was good. Yeah. That was a little rough from them. Then he fought John beat Ryan Bader with that crazy knockout. That was nuts. Ryan being a ran into that crazy, a straight left hand just rushed him. Those here in a la and the Munoz fight. I remember that was in like London. Some shit. I remember Munios Fan. I was trained with Munoz. He found out through social media is fighting Machida. It was like, Oh fuck that was in England.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       Whoa. Then he got smashed by Weidmann. Hey did they CB dollar and then Rockhold one was the worst. That was marijuana is really bad too. That was gruff and then he tested positive for something, right? Yeah. And then I don't know exactly what he's doing now. Yeah man. You get a certain amount of knockouts against guys like Rockhold and especially the Rockhold one was rough to get on top of doing it though. He's been doing karate since he was fucking three months old and he's just been doing it for a long ass time and yeah, it's interesting like these guys like Vito and him where their, their, their technique is still there. Their mind is still there but their body just can't keep up. Again, we'll give it a shot, give a shot. That's to me that when I looked at his fight in Mexico City, he's fighting on the undercard against Sam, Alvin Miguel.

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       Oh my God, man. And I love Rashad and the guy had been trading with forever and to see him, and I don't think, I don't know if the matter of physical, but mentally you can tell he's just not, he's not there as far as, not that he's punchy, but he just doesn't want to do anymore. Like he's not pulling the trigger. He's been knocked out before. I was the same way. Once I got knocked out, fee things change. Go. Okay, I'm not gonna, I'm not going to fight like that anymore. That kind of caution in the wind. Let's go. Let's sit in the pocket and bang. No, no, no, no, no. I've learned from that. And then Rashad just couldn't pull the trigger. I, I think, I think he's swaying towards being done well. He's holds a shrine now. Shit. How old is Rashad? Him?

Speaker 1:          01:00:53       He gets 39 yeah, he's up there. Yeah, he's had a great run. He's definitely had a great run, but you obviously enjoys doing it or he wouldn't be still doing it or the money. Yeah. I don't know. One of the 37 yeah, but the other thing with our shot is the games advanced so much further than wrestler with good boxing. You can't, you can't fuck with that anymore. At light heavyweight middleweight welterweight, you go down. What? You only have to ask, you only have two tools. You're screwed man. I kinda like yard Rodriguez. All these young kids go, you only Rasul and box. Oh my God, I'm eating him alive. But he can kick. I mean, remember he knocked out Sean Salmon with that high care got 10 as old school and Sean Sam and looked like every ups driver we've ever had. Yeah. But I would would think that he would get better at that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       You know, and it just never became like a big part of his game. His game was never like full on Moyie Thai oriented. Now it's like the Chuck Ladell thing. You know where sprawl and brawl. I'm going to fuck you up with my hand. Crazy as he trains with Tyrone Spong. I know. I mean, Tyrone Spong is fucking demon when it comes to standup man. Dude, he Merck's, this dude's so bad. And this was at light heavyweight, which is interesting because all along a lot of people thought he should be at one 85 he won the ultimate fighter heavyweight come crazy. Is that if I Brad imes. Yes. Giant ass dude in the finals. Yeah, Rochelle. It's just tough man. And he's a dude to play football too, right? Yeah, high school. But then he wrestled at Michigan State. His roommate was, uh, Greg, uh, Maynard crazy man. And then the other roommate is a big agent at CAA, which is hilarious.

Speaker 1:          01:02:29       All them are killing it. You know, you remember, uh, his knock out of chocolate dough. That was probably like the biggest highlight. Our Oh, AV or in the UFC really wouldn't play it. Just Chuck Ladell was like the main man. Remember for a while there they went play the chuck or Rhonda knockouts turn that bitch on, fosters the loop. Well, once WMA became the owners, they're like lists and like we don't play that game where we're here to self. Correct. I know he's your boy. Oh, there it is. Right there. One shot, I was a crazy, crazy high kick. They sh, I think they showed the chocolate. They'll knock out. They just didn't highlight it over and over. Over a long time. They went show chuck or Rhonda that Chuck one was so like, I remember that sound of that right hand land. Just Blab, upper cut. Oh No.

Speaker 1:          01:03:18       Chuck was going to throw the upper cut, his famous upper gut and then just that and reshot depth Dover with the overhand right on the fucking button, like a gunshot. I remember chage turmeric path, like his heart. He's like, yeah, here it is. Chuck's just, chuck was just such a fucking executioner. Chuck. There's rumors chuck wanted to fight again. He's in Thailand Training Shit. Wow. Hello. Great timing by Rashad. Perfect. Bowshot look at the fucking impact to that right hand that it's crazy. My God. You know, talking about chuck and Tito again and Bella tour, we'll talk about shale and Tito. They're talking about challenge Tito first, the child, Taylor talking shit to each other. They just fight. They just fight and catch a neck reconstructed and he has a tube in his neck. But then chill, start talking shit to fake discs. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:04:13       He got discs replaced it. We'd go full. Go to Tito's a Instagram page. He talked about it and then he said, chill, I'm kicking your ass. It was like so progress. Hey Tito, chill. I love both of you. Now I may know, but he tried to watch that shit. A ballot. Ours Pan. No one's watching it. I just saw it still sell. He does still a draw in the, you know, if he could talk chill and it talking some shit about him and people want to see them happening. Get Pete up again. It's actually a video though. If you play the video, Jamie, it's on his uh, somewhere on his Instagram. Oh look at that to say winter. His neck, um, go to is just the whole thing and I'll show you where it is. If you find it. There it is. That's it. Listen, let's play some volume on this.

Speaker 4:          01:04:54       Alright. Surgery's done. Three them off desk replacement. And so you want to fight, Huh? Disc replacement on my server, which is the neck area either let me call [inaudible] Smith and amazing job. Valerie. Thank you so much. Thank you that your sport, everybody reached out to me and Bridget sport. I'm alive. I'm fixed now. It's time to get ready cause chill. I'm kicking your ass.

Speaker 2:          01:05:30       Wait a minute. But how crazy is that? A guy coming out of knee neck reconstruction. He got three discs replaced. Like do you know when the UFC, if you have more than two discs replaced Ila, they don't think they are letting your fight right now. Uh, it makes sense. They were talking about um, uh, Rick story. Rick story has some disc replacements. It was neck. Yeah. And they're like, if you get to a certain amount, like we've got one your lower back one your neck like Ooh son, we're not sure if we want to fuck with this liability. Well who knows how good the guy did the neck thing. Like who, who did your thing like it's almost like, oh, like who's building your car? We'll send them to your guy. Then UFC like 70, the one guy who we can trust. Yeah. How he shut down this career.

Speaker 2:          01:06:18       How many dudes are doing this neck reconstruction thing? Everyone switched over looking for a deal at Eddie Bravo has got his back done. You know Eddie still having problems with it though. It's not 100%. A lot of people have problems with it. I mean the backs tricky man. But uh, one of the, one of his students, victor had his done and he's a big dude. He's real big. He was like heavyweight dude and it for him it's fine. Like he was lifting weights like really quickly and got back to Roland within a few months. I think it just depends man. But with Tito, he's had so much of the, you know, abuse as far as wrestling and fighting. He's got fusions too. He's got all sorts of shit going on. Kakoa straight up fighter it. Neck brace, Tongan chill. Get your ass ready. Like we're looking at, we're looking at like a year from now, bro.

Speaker 2:          01:07:02       Like how long does it take to recover from those surgeries? I wonder because, uh, what Eddie was saying was that, you know, like he might have pushed it too quick and like reinjured it a little bit. I rarely went, came and hit. Did he come in here like the next day we're doing [inaudible] pain and he was like drinking high off his ass and we're talking about, and he's like, I'm not gonna rush into it. Like I'm not doing much. But then if you're on the mats and you know, this problem is rolling is too fun. Yeah, you can't roll if you're injured. You know, I think the only thing you should do ever, if you're injured his drill and just use it as a time to drill because you can get really good, he'd get really good by drilling, but as soon as you're, like, if you're dealing with something that's recovering like a surgery, if you like, have to explode and exert weird energy and weird ways, you never know, like you, you don't want to get tapped.

Speaker 2:          01:07:47       You don't want your guard to get past you don't want, so you'll just fucking la. You're in the middle of it, you'll law. And when you do that, ma'am, palm messes it up. You feel the back where you got surgery twinge again. You're like, ah, came over fucked all that worked up. I'll tell you what's crazy speaking of injuries is when I saw patty hooligan and Dublin, he and he's the outgoing cro, you know, smart dudes speaks well we're talking. I'm like, Dude. So once the next fight and his whole team was just like, God dammit. I'm like, what?

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       I didn't hear him. But he has a rare blood disorder, like less than 1% of the world have it. And it's really not that dangerous. But if it did, if something were to happen, it's like super dangerous. So the UFC is like, it's too much of a risk. We can't, can't clear you to fight. So he's done. Whoa. So how does the blood disorder work? I'm not sure you got me. I'll have to look it up. Jamie. He has some super rare blood disorder. Super, super rare where you'll have to look it up for, I don't want to this concern like if he needs a transfusion or something. Yeah, something like that where the UFC, he's just too high of a risk. So he's done. But he was open a gym without SBG with Connor at their gym and then he decided to do his own like up the street.

Speaker 1:          01:08:57       Why you're doing that. But crazy story man. Crazy. I had no idea. I felt I felt bad for him. But good spirits, man. Good spirits. He's going to start doing podcasts and I want to start doing some other stuff. Well that's cool. You know, here it is. Um, he was born with a factor missing in his blood called factor 13. I never disclosed it until now and came to the UFC is attention from a third party. I can no longer pass the medical requirements to compete. Only one in 5 million people are diagnosed. So I knew that it was rare. Organizations wouldn't understand or take a chance at me as a found out. Now I never explained in full to John on my team the actual risks. Cause I didn't think there was accessible access risks. What it sort of, if it's not, if he doesn't think there is an access risk, it's a disorder that is only dangerous for me and not my opponents.

Speaker 1:          01:09:49       I really did see MMA is a way to have a real shot at life for myself and my family and it turns out I was right. Wow. I have mixed emotions. This is a sad, can you look up the disorder? How sad is it when you talk about a guy who his spirits are super up like he was joking about it. He's just like, what the fuck you know? He is a, he's a son and his girl was there and I was like, oh I felt so bad for him, but he was like, doll ball. I got this. I'm doing my thing here at SPG. I got my own gym. You know like things are good and I'm starting getting the podcast. He's going to be good at it too, man. If you can get that good at fighting, you get that good at anything.

Speaker 1:          01:10:20       You just have to think about it the right way here. It is. It is. It's a rare oh, clotting. Oh yeah. Ooh. A bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency of clotting factor 13 clotting factors or specialized proteins that are essential for the blood to clot properly. Oh, he's like a hemophilia, uncontrolled bleeding episode. Fuck all that. Like what if you get a Marvin Eastman and the head starts in foreign blood and they can't stop it. You know, like something about foreheads like forehead just bleed a lot. So should with them now. Elbows as you show. Yes. Peak of the elbow. Hit like, think about how much more forehead's bleeding like a knee. Oh yeah. You know what I'm saying? Elbows like fucking if we get needed, it's always in the face. You're shit's all fucked up with patty. It's a bummer man. One in 5 million. Crazy. And what are the odds? I know, man. Super heartbreaking. Do you know the odds on Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor? Only four to one. Five to one, right. Connor, I saw it.

Speaker 1:          01:11:18       Maybe it's changed the article's odd swing. I'd been on this hound, this Connor decried hound changing complete Conner date. Just changing the odds. You really think he's got a chance. Yeah, I do. He's Beverly. Dude is a lot bigger, man. It's like a Mack truck. He's awkward Floyd. Two years off. I'm, I'm, I'm a little curious why it was still a junior. Bernard Hopkins. Correct. Plus Three 25 whoa. Whoa. It's down to three. Take it back. Jesus Christ. Praise Zit in my four fifth do you wanna hear something hilarious? Those odds are things, those are odds are smaller than when he fought Canelo that's crazy. Those odds are changing because of the, the fucking video. Just a matter of amount of people were betting on Conner. I know how people are listening. They might not know what the odds are. I would, I explain odds. People are like, what the fuck man, how you win 100 bucks.

Speaker 1:          01:12:23       Most people, I have to explain it every time we go to the UFC to send someone. Yeah. When the odds first came out, I fucked up. I thought you got 26 one I got at 15 to 100 win by knockout. It's always so weird when you see the numbers like plus four 50 like how who comes out in the open with it, you know if they opened with an odd, that's when it gets really crazy. How do they do that? And it's like an expert opinion. They do it on purpose to get you they cause they want bedding so they show our purpose to get people to go here. Show Floyd loves us. Cause you know Floyd always bets on himself in a Shitload of money. So Floyd's like yes, keep it going. Did you see a footage came out that is not footage but news leaked and I think it's all honey dicking that Zap Judah knocked that Floyd Mayweather and training and Floyd shut down the gym.

Speaker 1:          01:13:05       What? Yeah, look that shit up Jamie. Pull that shit up. Jamie telling you this APP Judah yesterday they said knock them out. I think it's all smoke and mirrors. I think Floyd just trying to sell this to the Max. Well that would be smart. I'm Floyd's part is brilliant. How close is he? Would Zap Judah that they would organize that? I mean SAP Jews like, yeah, I'll take that. Shine was the last time you mentioned the name Psap. Judah. Very good point. Word from inside the money teams Abdu to knocked out Floyd maybe in sparring during a wild exchange where both boxes began to brawl. Apparently Floyd kicked everyone out of the gym afterwards. More to come. Zap was mimicking Connor and just came right after him. Whoa. Says Mario Vegas Post Mario Vegas and we trust Mario. Mario. Talk to me. Well, look at him. That glamor shot, glamor shot. Head shot bothers the fuck out. It doesn't bother me at all. He looks like a very reasonable American's 14 tweets. I'm sure a hundred followers. Sure he votes conservative. You know what I think you could have a conversation with. I think he's a troll. I wouldn't mind having a beer with them.

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       I don't believe that. I think there'd be more smoked. I think literally Floyd's just playing this full. He'll like, I got knocked out. Look Conner definitely a week before or word Zap. Judah and him might have gone to war because he does go to Warren gyms. He does make you seem talk shit and go to war warm with people in sparring sessions as Abdula Young Ethan's. Absolutely. It's true. But Zap Judy can crack. We know that factors. Yeah. He cracked Floyd a few times when they fought, if you remember that he can crack. Yeah. Floyd Mayweather and Zap Judah unleash chaos in Las Vegas. April. Yeah. Wow. It's back at the temperate battle between Mayweather and the current sparring partners have Judah. Yeah. They had a great war man. Phenomenal fun. And if Zap Judah, I mean look, zap Jude is lightning fast. If he hasn't lost a step and they actually did get into a wild exchange and he, Floyd got crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       It is entirely possible. It hasn't lost a step. I mean guarantee has. Yeah, probably. Probably. I mean as far as like his speed and power, I bet it's still there. I mean it's like timing, but I'm what I'm trying to set you right. His reaction to losing a staff is probably not the best way to describe it, but he's still got it skills and he's still got some serious power for shows how to drop bombs. And if he drops a bomb on Floyd, if they really did have some crazy exchange, it's 100% possible that you could imagine. Correct. Zap Judah not released knocking down Floyd. I'll tell you this. If he did get knocked out a week before the fight and you fight and hung Antonio Saturday Bueno, we go and Sizzler, I might just fucking no Bueno. Omnipresent showtime. Everybody. I like the same story kind of happened before the packout Mayweather fight and uh, well maybe did it happened if it said Florida flooring's Zap Judah denies flooring.

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       Mayweather doing sparring is prepare shit. Maybe they have Jesus, whoops, his ass Uriah faber style. Probably so comfortable with being there with Floyd. He's box Floyd professionally as a fighter and as training part true. Like, you know, like you get each of other's patterns. You understand those patterns. Yeah. And who knows? Also, you know like who knows how seriously Floyd's taking this, that's the thing. Need the money for sure. That's the other thing is like rumors coming out. Like again, these are all rooms. Have you seen the condition rumors too? I love the drama kids. So excited too. I'm like, yes. Yes. What else happened? Keep it coming. Come on. Um, have you seen the picture of Floyd at 40? It looks good. Good. I'm a fuck you. It looks like he's on that Brock Lesnar. He looks red and he looks great under 2.5. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:16:34       Wow. Wow, wow, interesting. Um, that's the only way Mcgregor's going to win. I think if it's under the two and a half I'll, no, not in an under two and a half, but by stoppage I think. Yeah, me too. I can't imagine him out boxing. No, that ain't happening yet. You're living in a rung fucking planet if you think you've seen to help box around of them. Unless he figures out a way to mall. I'm like, he's done a style like he's doing there with holding the back of the head and throwing punches, but that's after he's worn Paulie out. I think you're going to see, I think you see Connor using his footwork still the distance trying to, you know, still do what got him to the dance. He might. What if he drops one on Floyd and Floyd go stiff face plants? I would love that.

Speaker 1:          01:17:13       I think he's going to land one on Floyd. I think so. I think Carter went, when's the spectacle? The probably loses in decision, but if there is a stoppage it's Connor knocking them out. Well, you know we're talking today about them going to eight ounce gloves and how how significant the official commission just granted it. That first of all shows you, you could just, you could just pull those commissioners a silent go. What's these rule drug testing? Why are we talking about rules? Let's have some fun here. Let's have some fun. I wonder if WME came along like when they bought the UFC that like, oh, what? What's, what do you saw the guy? Yeah. What's we need? What's up with the Golden? We got about another six months. Can't we listen? Let's just direct that guy towards weight cutting. Can you just have them like folks on the guys than the undercarriage and we do that.

Speaker 1:          01:18:00       Hello? We get out of this. You saw of them for rentals backing up percent, hundred percent when Andre Berto said, when he fought Floyd, he's never been tested more in his life. He was like four times a week they'd knock on my door. Stop all dressed up like agents. That's what he says. He goes, are you testing Floyd like this? They go, that's none of your concern. He was just the promoters obligation as the promoters. Floyd Mayweather. He goes, you'll figure it out. He just kept getting tested nonstop. Yeah. He wants more of your blood. He wants you to make you tired, you know? Yeah. I'll tell you what though. I don't know what the drug testings like on this bad boy, but it was interesting because he made Connecticut down to one 50 you know they fought at one 50 and can, they always makes people to come to him like you have to play by his rules and his fight though.

Speaker 1:          01:18:50       That's what's so scary. Yeah. That's why I tip my hat to Floyd because he went to fight at one 54 that's like, that's all right. That's perfect for Connor. Yeah. I will do a dance clubs. What? The frills? Yeah. Yeah. We'll do that. We'll do it all. Take on short notice to this motherfucker is crazy. I just think he thinks he's so good. He might just not understand like first of all, Connor is whether or not you'll look. You're looking at his success inside the octagon, which had been pretty spectacular, but it's the way he's doing things. He's got this special fucking air about him and this very psychotic belief in himself. It's a D it's not a fake belief. No, he's not. He's not trying to con anybody. He's trying to manifest like some sort of miraculous existence. He's trying to be the guy who literally goes in there and drops and smashes Floyd Mayweather as a UFC fighter and then becomes with that the biggest athlete on the planet earth.

Speaker 1:          01:19:49       Ever. Maybe ever, if he flatlines Floyd made in Fort Wayne, where are there steps in and Connor fucking karate stance is ham and blast them with a straight left hand and we see Floyd stiffen up and face plant North Korea nukes where we're going to turn the ocean green shit. Okay. We're all, we're going to manufacture all of the color. That green color that you put in drinks on Saint Patrick's day, pouring that shit in the ocean. We're making the ocean green. Just all green. Just huge statues of Conor. You're going to have people that are faking Irish accents. That's sort of like that. Rachel Dolezal chick pretended to be black, is going to be people that are changing but put a show on the beginning. Agritech tattoos on their chest. They're going to change themselves and become Irish. They're going to be trans. It'll get that. That's what the world's going to done. What is that? When did that happen? Cargo on Saint Patrick's Day. They do that really? Other fish.

Speaker 1:          01:20:49       Oh my God, we're so gross. People are so gross. Let's have some fun and get fucking hammered it and make the ocean greed. The fish are like, what the fuck? I can't believe they really do this. It's awesome though. Oh my God. It's like a domino. It's only in Chicago. I'm amazed that Boston doesn't take this on. You're fucking battle in me. They don't in fucking Chicago. Really? Shit. I feel like it's a bad idea can be, well it's probably some food based stuff. The family that dies the Chicago River Green. Wow. The Hawk family. How weird is pure toxic? Yeah. Wonder how bad it is. And one if there's like some environmentalists that are protesting or percent that can't be great for anything in there that's just died. It's natural. Not really. Why don't you? Um, Google environmentalist protest green dye in Chicago River. See, let's see if there's some environmentalists that think it's fucking terrible.

Speaker 1:          01:21:49       I 60 pounds of die. That's it. At top secret format. Awesome. As we call it. Leprechaun dust. I'll fuck you. How about you tell us what the fuck. The top secret formula right now with your tits tits. The Dad on the right. Oh yeah. Set of sweet old old man. We get them and it's like a mock turtleneck that looks like the Kinda Guy who kills a burger with his bare hands. He looks like the kind of guy that kills millions of fish by dumping green dye in the Goddamn river. We get those fucks. Fuck is drowned in mermaids.

Speaker 1:          01:22:22       I get their gills all clogged gut leaky. Those guys got, damn it. Yeah, you're right though man. If God were to pull it off, I don't. He's the biggest athlete of all time. Oh, all the time. He's going to be worldwide in the in the craziest way possible. You see a Nike shoe like to join, but with this on it, if he actually can land that shit, there's the thing. Nobody's gonna ever box Floyd like that from a karate stance. Never. He's never seen it before and he's been doing a lot of that taekwondo footwork thing where he switches back and forth switches Stanson ton. If he can keep that kind of distance, it's going to be very hard for Floyd to hit him too. It's a totally different feel. Different fields. The only thing I think, worst case scenario, obviously worst case you get starch in like 10 seconds.

Speaker 1:          01:23:04       That's not going to happen. But worst case it would be with eight ounce gloves and Floyd sarcs landing and beating him up and he gets stopped like seventh or eighth or can't answer the bell cause he's taken so much punishment or an eight rounds. He gets really tired from Logan so much. Then it could be a shit show for it. It's a different expenditure of energy for sure. Different animals switching legs like that and switches dances, but hey listen, he's doing in training. You don't get to counters level without realizing what you're signing for. It like to me, if Carl were to gas in this fight, there's a sear and then everything we believe in commerce fake, which I don't think it's going to happen. While the only other explanation B, he's not quite efficient enough yet to go 12 rounds of the world champion.

Speaker 1:          01:23:43       You know if he really started gas like you're talking about something that he has a part of his training but it's also kicking takedown down defense, Jujitsu, elbows, knees and some say is more down. Yes, we'll definitely cardio was a lot of people say it's more difficult like inbox and get your rest and like in boxing, which is why I think Conor is going to win a majority of those early rounds and you know Floyd, you know, four, five, six rounds before he's really even start sweating and he downloads your patterns that goes to work. The Andre Berto said that he goes, he comes out and he'll force you to come to him and he's looking around. He's literally downloading everything, but it takes them a while to get going before he gets it and then starts going to work with Connor. I think in those rounds he can land something big there.

Speaker 1:          01:24:25       Man. If he does see the exciting thing is, if he does, that's exciting thing. That's what, that's what's going to make it the biggest paper view of all time. Those white power people are going to go crazy. That Twitter account is a fake account apparently. Which one? New, it's not a real newspaper. And some people I found out that the picture is even like a small business owner from somewhere else. Which which uh, the Zap judo, the troll doll account. Okay. So the him knocking him out, his fake. That's Dennis. I told you, hey, hey boy trolling the fake guy. He looks like the average American. You had to get shot Avatar or like Iowa. You went to Iowa, you went to a family restaurant. Hi, welcome. They all look like go to Las Vegas Post and nothing comes up. Oh that son of a bitch. Damn it flood.

Speaker 1:          01:25:12       You've got to do better at selling this man. There's some, while it might not even be him, it might just be somebody just going for clicks, you know, having some fun. A lot of people make up stories. It's true. Flood hasn't come out and say anything, but you don't like my mom will be like, why did he got knocked out and buying it? It works. It does work well, especially after looking at that video. I mean that's what ramps it up. Looking at the video of Khan and landed on Paula, Dana White, put some more video out. That's all I'm saying. He has a full taste. Here's the full footage from what I heard from what I heard is they thought that footage is going to make it an all access. And Dana was like, yeah, put in the all access of Connor doing what he did to Paula and they didn't put in there.

Speaker 1:          01:25:51       So Dana was like release the hounds and then released on his end. Oh, so showtime didn't put it in there? No, no, no. It came from Dana. Did they not come from showtime? Okay. Why would show time not want to put in there? So they just denied putting it in there. They didn't want to put it in there. I don't think that, I don't, I don't think they, they denied that ever happen. They're just like, we're not putting all access like for why? I have no idea who put that in all access. I don't know. But that seems ridiculous. I don't know. Are you trying to sell a fight or nay, but yeah, and then Dana was like, Yo, you're not going to do it. Release the hounds. Everybody real advocate. That's when it came from his account. Why the fuck would they not play that clip?

Speaker 1:          01:26:28       I don't know. I guess they love Pauly Paul. He's an analyst for them. Right, but still it is what it is. Yeah. If anything, I listen man. It's spine. We talked and we're talking about practice like it's, it is what it is. [inaudible] loss those, those, those in those exchanges there was a clear loser and a clear winner. It doesn't mean the entire sparring session. No, and we won't know that until after the fight. And most knowledgeable fighting fans know that like, oh, that's a, that's a part of it. But shit, Connor can actually hit like shit. He looks pretty good. He looks real. And even if you're a box and paying like holy shit, that's poly mail and nausea. He just got rocked. Shit. Maybe I won't buy the fight. Yeah, it's given me a wake us, no matter what, I'm going to buy it. I'm going to buy it from fucking DC.

Speaker 1:          01:27:13       I'm going to be in Washington DC to your work in the night, right? Working that night. So if you hear the crowd, oh my God, if they asked me to do something to the showtime, but I'd be like, I don't even know what I would do. Like what would I be doing? Like it'd be offering my opinions. I have none. I fly out next Monday for him. I'm working, I'm on the whole coverage team with showtime Tuesday through Saturday. I don't know what I'm doing on Saturday yet. Honestly. Dude, I really feel like if they were smart, like this is this kind of like the kind of shit that we do when you and I just sit down and talk. This is really what they need. Yes. You get a bunch of goofy people sitting around with ties on and some circle and everyone's talking over everybody and there's a production meeting and you say this and you say this.

Speaker 1:          01:27:53       I agree. Yeah. And there's morrow and then there's a fucking two or three boxers and everyone's Bernstein and they're all talking over each other. It's, it's uh, it's not, in my opinion, it's not the most entertaining way to listen to people break down shit. And this is a fight where you really, you really want to consider all the different possibilities. Like Max Kellerman is always saying like, Floyd has the advantage if they're fighting on the moon, Floyd has, he had managed bare knuckle Floyd as the advanced. Like okay, you totally sure. He totally sure Mr Skip Bayless method where it's going to make headlines but they don't have to believe that. Macks believed that. I don't, I don't think back to Lisa. I think he's so, so old school boxing, he has to say he loves him and may too, man. I've had long conversations with kind of, but I think smart, he's very smart.

Speaker 1:          01:28:42       He's my favorite alias. I love Max Guy. He's a very good note. When I was in a favorite, you're well, I'm saying boxing Komatsu. Come on brother comes to box and when, when when he goes, when he goes congress, I can hit him and I was like, no, just shred. I bet you $100,000 open, a joint account sent to his team like this. How seriously I got Atlanta Glove. Oh really? Come with man, come on Mac. It could happen that Floyd just storms out and fucking one pudge chaos thing with showtime. I had this uh, chat with us when knows about it and I said, I don't know what you know, I don't be part of it. I'm not sure where I'm gonna do. I said, but what you have going on as you have your traditional box and commentators, which is great and that's usually what you do.

Speaker 1:          01:29:18       This is not your typical fight. You cannot have a bias panel who don't know anything about Conor Mcgregor. Yeah. They looked as fights up or whatever or they just mimic or say what they've heard previously, but they really don't know what Connor's doing. You have to have someone, whether it's me or not, but I think it's going to be me. You have to have someone telling you what Connor's doing, what he needs to do to, to win the fight. You can't have just a pro bias box and commentating team because what's going to make this the biggest paper of all time is the UFC fans. Of course, we're the ones that are going to buy this bitch, the old box and heads. Look at triple g. That's your best boxer. 200,000 paper view buys probably 300,000 that's your path. But you know Andre Ward is right up there with him and Andre Ward gets way more now.

Speaker 1:          01:30:01       He doesn't, they don't do very well. Look up Andre Ward Kovalev to what it was, the pace of the box. 275,000 that's it. But still a hundred more than didn't triple g's. Still pretty match of a huge fight too. And I'm saying so the Dana White do UFC, Conor McGregor, that fan base to UFC fan base is like nothing else man. They would, I pay 100% true. So you can't have just a bias box and contained Kovalev does just over 160,000 oh my God, I'll put a picture of me lifting weights in the back. God hundred and 65,000 buys. Wow. So that's basically the same as triple g in the, in the ward Kovalev to does around hundred 25,000 pay per view buys. How crazy is that? Is that which one's right? Jalon ones July. Oh, the first one versus the second one? No, the second one does 125 it's a paper loop flop.

Speaker 1:          01:30:54       So the most it did, it said it pulls in one 65 that was the final thing, which is Tavon, which is a leader or to that magnitude of that fight. No one is June 30th and it said one 25 and they still have June 27 160,000 the second 125.0 no. Really? Oh my God. That's terrible. So it's that stuff failure, like you losing money when you do that. And you paid Andre Ward, you know, six and a half million dollars. Did he get that much? Yeah. And that, you know, you're talking about one of the best fights of vault, especially the maze. And the fight is amazing. What was more troubling, not only the pay per view buys down, but attendance numbers. And Kate Revenue at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas was not even close to matching the first bout, which is held at t mobile arena. It's tickets sold 6,000 tickets.

Speaker 1:          01:31:42       Whoa, that's crazy. Wow. So if you're gonna make this the biggest paper of all time, you've got a bank on the mixed martial arts crowd by his thing. Yeah. So if you want them to buy it, they're going to buy for coming anyways. But you've got to have a voice in there that's at least going to relate to people. Yeah. And here's another argument for the Andre Berto fight, which was the retirement fight for Floyd. He only got like 300,000 papers. Horrible. Horrible. When you, considering that he got 4 million for the Manny Pacquiao fight, right? Wasn't something crazy like that 4 million, which is the biggest of all time. So he goes from the biggest of all time to a fight worth 300,000 people buy it, which is like really mediocre. Horrible. The only people are buying Floyd Mayweather fights or people that want to see Floyd Mayweather. They get fucked up.

Speaker 1:          01:32:26       Yeah. And when he doesn't get fucked up, they go, damn, they get upset. See, I love even Floyd apologize for the pack yet. But yeah, he was like, yeah, my bat like that sucked. I that like, that was not fun man. It was crazy. Cause Pat Guy was injured and then pat out fought that fight with a fucked up shoulder pack. Yes. Hating on this fight. I won't even watch it. I guarantee your ass it's more entertaining than your fight with Floyd. I can guarantee you that. He's just still salty. Yeah. Cause he's not, he, he just lost the fucking homeboy Horn in Australia and you have to rematch him. A school teacher straight up. Straight up. That's the rich Franklin or boxing. Yeah. Just, I don't know if that was the correct decision because I didn't, uh, I didn't try to score that. I see both ways.

Speaker 1:          01:33:07       I watched her twice. I can see both ways, but, but uh, when I was watching on my ground like door, I'm like, God, I feel like corn might have pulled that off. She's like, really? I'm like, yeah, I can't listen to the commentators. They're soap bias against horn. I feel like he might've did enough or especially early on. I'm like, I kind of bring it to him. How many times they get dropped once or twice horn in the, I think it was the 10th round, they almost stopped it because the Knight Eight, ninth or 10th one of those rounds, they were like, hey, if you don't show some improvement here, we're going to stop the fight. So that was a rough round, but still the, the, the culmination of all the rounds, I thought horn pulled it off. Interesting. Either there's argument for either one still pack.

Speaker 1:          01:33:43       Yeah. He lost the horn. You're going to hate on, you know, Mayweather and fucking Connor. Come on man. You're gonna Watch it. He's still salty because also he's got class action lawsuits against him because he fought with a fucked up shoulder and a lot of people bet on you. Fucked us. Yeah. That's a weird situation. If you're a fan and you know that the guy came into the fight, compromise, get that paycheck, but for pay, but at the same time, a lot of fighters fight with injuries. Right. That's a big one though. I mean, he's a puncher and his shoulder's fucked. Like he can't throw. Hey Man, what did he do? I guess they schedule. I wonder what they did they give them a cortisone shot? What did they do? Yeah. I mean we didn't do it, but if you're manly packet, what do you do?

Speaker 1:          01:34:20       Just like, Hey, I'm injured. We're going to have to reschedule a slate. Oh, I think he figured, well, I'm going to fuck it up. I'm going to get surgery anyway. I just fuck it up further. True. Go in there and sling bombs and hopefully our catch and did nothing. Horrible fight. Well, it's just, I think he was really compromised in his movement. You know? I still don't think you'd beat him, but, no, I don't think so either. I think his style, and particularly as much shorter and smaller than Conor, and he's a very fast, but you know, he's also been knocked out by Manmohan Marquez when Juan manwell mark has knocked him out without one punch. Fucking devastating lamb. Kao Earth, like literally stood still for a second when that happened. Dude, I mean that was his clean a one punch knock every

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       going to see my face. Yeah, it was a horrible knockout. Perhaps Marquez was on the supplements of his home country. I think all of them were. Yeah, I think both of them. I think there's, you know, steroids in that pitch. I think there's Mexicans, steroids and that was [inaudible] about Manny is that Manny had gone up so many different way classes and kept his power and and people like, come on son. He was like, get the fuck out. It's probably gay. I don't hate on those guys. I just assume he's doing it. I don't hate on him either. I mean, look, the deal is that a, you pass the tests. That's the deal. Not Testing. I don't give a fuck. You're fighting Marquez. Who's clearly on those Tiawana Tiawana Tamale fucking protein powder. Is he alive? Testosterone son? The Teal on a test, you know, 100% if he got in that Filipino, you know what's crazy is that dude, I'm Juan Manwell Marquez had the same trainer.

Speaker 2:          01:35:52       They used to be a trainer for Manny. Who's the Guy Hooked Hook? What's the name? Angel. Uh, I think it's Alex something. I thought it was like ally it something like that. Really smart physical conditioning trainer. He had Manny doing a bunch of really interesting stuff. He's very good. Very good. But he got picked up before he got busted before for like injecting the Bain stuff. Yeah. He got in trouble before the, it was at the same dot guy that got in trouble. Like that's his thing. Right? Like that's what he was known for. I know he's supposed to be a really good trainer regardless. Well you know, I mean you kind of think when you got a guy like a Floyd or one men, Mel Marquez or you know anybody or Manny, you got like a championship caliber athlete. You know, you got like you had a Ferrari.

Speaker 2:          01:36:36       Yeah. I mean you gotta make sure the tires are good, suspensions tight and like you're a physical conditioning trainer. You can't fuck the guy up too bad. By the time he gets to his boxing skill work, you don't want him to be that exhausted. But also if we're racing cars and you know, homeboy over here put up feet 12 in his, he can't be running with a v 10 maths V12 we've got to manage that. Let's get that Filipino hot sauce. Yeah, like that's, that's the game though. Yeah, I would man. He was in his prime to God whatever him judge Jack Jack Shit. And I remember he was like get strip clubs, like wiling out very Jon Jones Ish. And then his wife was like, this shit has to stop and then got flashlight and he's like, Jesus, let's do it. Yeah. He found the g's are stressing all weird for government and changed his life.

Speaker 2:          01:37:22       Changed his life. I don't know if that's the best thing for fighters, man. Oh, who knows? It's a problem as, especially now with testing, you know, they show up at your house and knock on the door. You gotta be clean. Yeah. You got a rubber dick and a really good friend. Even missing blood. Even then you're in trouble, man. Yeah. You got to have a twin and have that twin like live a steady healthy diet. I don't just don't tell anybody about him. Just leave him in the basement. Look at them. They're against Marcos Antonio, Bruh. Do I got pissed so bad. Can I pee right way? Hold it down. Super jacked there. There's ones where you list, he's looked jacked. Damn Jack there too.

Speaker 2:          01:38:05       That's the other Floyd fight. Yeah. When it, when he was like, when he first started out he was, I think he was, I think he started out as a flyweight like I'm not sure though. I'd have to look at is a career record pull up Manny Pacquiao is career record cause I'm pretty sure he went through eight different weight classes, which is crazy. Really stop and think about that. I don't think very many people have done it. So, oh, this is boring for a podcast which is going over stats of Manny Pacquiao. Who the fuck knows what's going to happen? Man. That. What's interesting is that it's actually going to happen. I'm just a big fan of freak shows and that's, and I don't mean that disrespectfully like that. It's not a real contest obviously. Obviously it is from a betting perspective and obviously it is because Connor is a real combat sports world champion, but it's a freak show in that it's, we don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:39:07       It's not like, like if Connor fought Hofeld dos Anjos at one 70 it's a fight like, Ooh, this is going to be interesting. I wonder how that's gonna play out. I wonder if it's, you know, they were supposed to fight at one 55 I wonder if Tilson Joe's can fit, you know, that kind of thing happens. That's an interesting fight. That's interesting to think about. You have all these variables. You've seen their fights. Now we're seeing Connor box. You see like little tiny clips. That's all he ever see. When's the last time where there's a fight like this where it's like made like by the people I don't think ever UFC at all. Ever while there's James Tony Versus Randy coture. But James was well past his prime and you know, really didn't train for it at all. He didn't know. I mean there was, it was a video, James toney preparing for the Randy coture fight and he was way out of shape and it was just kind of like hitting pads and the guy who like shoot the worst double leg take down on them and the history of the known universe and James had kind of sprawl and he be like, yeah, and we're going to my rambling, you know, working on my box and no one on my box where's on my boxes.

Speaker 2:          01:40:11       And they said he barely trend for the, but that's the blocks in next week's like, I mean it's like James, Tony come in your welding. No, it's not. It's fucking not out of shape. Didn't respect the game. Yeah, just kind of was doing it for the paycheck. It's like if Anthony Joshua gets, you know, if he's got an actual black belt in Jujitsu we don't know about and then decide to fight MMA. But he's all right. And Steve, but he's already Anthony. Joshua. Yes. Yeah. That's really what it's about. That's what it's like. It's like how's he going to deal with kicks? I was going to deal with that. That's where it's a lot. There's some x factors like I don't know, but I know he does these two things very damn way and he's super good at knocking people dead. Yes. Yeah. I think that's one of the things that guy does like that's, that's a real threat he's at in his prime.

Speaker 2:          01:40:53       He's 28 years old. It's a real threat and you know [inaudible] he's going to do it. Yeah. Like the comes is he 100% believes he's going to win this fight, which is when you got a guy like that and he has momentum on his side and you get the fucking nation of Ireland behind your God and man at some game of Thrones special shit. And also Floyd legitimately is almost 41 like I think he might be 41 at the fight. Like I think like his birthday happens between like what's his birthday like he might be 41 now and he's in training camp. He turned 41 that find out what it is. That's true. Release on Instagram though. I was like, he does not look 41 yeah, he's great. February. Okay. So he's real close, whatever it is. So when he gets to be whatever the age is, when the wheels fall off it, that's the thing.

Speaker 2:          01:41:42       Who knows what happens if he gets dinged, I think he will be slower. And because if it's Floyd in its heyday, yeah, Kinda didn't stand a chance. But Floyd notch slower man. Well you remember my Donna, you know Donna came in fucking winging bombs at Floyd. Yeah. And the first fight Floyd kind of, I think maybe there were underestimated him or didn't understand like the like the style that he was going to present and he got clipped, he got clipped with one punch at the end of one of the rounds where his legs wobbled and I was like, whoa. And then re matter of Floyd did the rematch, cad it, pick them apart. What's, he downloaded it but oh yeah, I see. Matt just made it, didn't take him serious. It's possible or it's possible. My Dawna fought really well and the first fight and didn't fight so well in the second fight for various reasons.

Speaker 2:          01:42:28       Yeah. But the only thing with that is Connor, so much different than May Donna. It's way more skillful and he's also, he's very capable of doing weird shit. Like at a distance. His ability to move in and out is very crisp. You know, it's like you have to, you have to respect it. Like what he did to f two Josie Aldo slid back and drop that left hand in silly. That's not something a lot of people are capable of doing under fire. No, no. Especially the what? The stakes and your margin of error and the mixed, my shot just so much smaller than boxing. It's just, you know, it's his timing that makes him special in his time and we'll be better than Floyd's. Floyd's can be a little slower. I just think cottage timing with the speed and power. That's why, that's why I give them a shot.

Speaker 2:          01:43:12       If Floyd sleeps on him at all and Connor comes in and does something very unusual and catches flow with a big punch early, it could be chaos with eight ounce calls. How about Floyd? You're crazy, man. Well, here's the thing. MMA fighters fight with four ounce gloves. So like why is boxing decided that eight ounces are what's safe for everybody? 135 pounds and up 10 ounces, eight ounces would say for anybody 135 pounds down. So that's like only a few weight classes. It's not shipped. But also those boxing gloves, man, 10 ounces when he got the wrap on. I mean if you have clubs under hands, man, literally clubs just protect me from breaking it. That's 10 ounces.

Speaker 1:          01:43:54       Yeah. Interesting. It makes us so interesting. Yeah. It becomes like an MMA fight more [inaudible]. It's not, it's going to be real weird. It's got to be real weird until we see what happens when you know, we might see Floyd pick them apart. Yeah. And that the how the odds are that's going to happen by just, I don't see it man. If he really does start fighting like this though. Ooh, that would be weird. If Connor starts doing this, doing that, you're going to see it. It's going to be those, those first four rounds people, hopefully whoever you're watching with, there's just silence. Just what in the fuck are we seeing right now? What Floyd is also a counter striker and so it was Connor, but if Connor starts doing some weird karate shit and get some on its heels, gets some moving back and it's somehow or another can get them into some weird position where he can move faster than Floyd understands or he could close the distance quicker than Floyd expects.

Speaker 1:          01:44:46       I listen, I ask Polly, I go to poly. I know, I know you guys hate each other, all that, but when you're sparring, would there things that were landing because he did some things that were unexpected and definitely landed. I'm like, man, that's the thing with Connors. If he's gonna, if he has that in his bag, his bag of tricks, when he throws it, it has to count because as soon as you throw it Floyds and go, got it downloaded, downloaded, how many do you have? Four. Five over 12 rounds. You better make them fucking count, man. Yeah. It's like yet five bullets. You better, you better hit the target man. Yeah, it's true. Right? Right. And here's the other thing. How Brittle or Floyd's hands really pretty brittle, broken them a few times, right? But it was a huge factor from if you've ever seen, uh, like his training, stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          01:45:33       After every session is hands on pure ice and they had some [inaudible] at night massage his hand. So it's obviously a factor, right? Let's say that was, was that before his last fight? If Roberto was, what else been going on for quite some time. I still get sore. Yeah. So think about this. Eight ounce gloves. He hits Conor in that giant Irish head that the has a forehead. Let's be real. It's good looking. Doobie has a dome on him. He hits that hand, breaks his hand. Ooh, we go and Sizzler, certain factors I like to bank on that's, I'm recognizes that his hands broken and he starts talking to him. But all you have is a jab and he starts Shumlin put his hands behind his back. Broke your fucking hand, your fork to your book. Your fucking hand didn't hit a little core and get lit head to can you imagine?

Speaker 1:          01:46:23       And then he just inoculates Floyd just walked him down. That's an interesting, like people were really mad at him for calling Floyd boy. Oh Man. He can call each other bitch motherfucker don't say boy this song cause Oh, do you know Joe? You? Yes. My boys were boys with Andre Birthday. I was like, I kept saying homeboy don't, when he left I was like Mass Jack. No racist. Hashtag homeboys okay. Yeah. Homeboys like, oh he's my homeboy. Hey homeboy, you got to really figure this out. It's weird though cause it has boy in it. Like you can't have any pause between home and boy. Oh home boy. Yeah. He can't say that to a black guy. No, it's too much boy. And it's too, I gotta be careful man. Cause like with, with Berto, he said something like, Oh that's my boy. It's hard to say triggered around a black guy.

Speaker 1:          01:47:12       Trigger trigger. Trigger. Why? Because it sounds like, yeah, right. Yeah. You're like any word that's close. I said tre, tre, tre. I said tea bro. [inaudible] rigor. Yeah. Boy You just can't. Yeah you can't. You can't like did you see Cody Garbrandt kept calling? Uh, sterling boy, boy, two boys. A weird one. We just got to take it out though. You like on social media. Can't do that. But why not will cause the, I mean, come on Joe. It's weird but cool. But here's the thing, if aljamain started talking shit about Cody, that boy can't touch me no problem at all. I know. See I don't have a problem with that. Crazy. No one has a problem with it. Well but black people can use the n word in boy. Right? Cause they kinda that like they went through some shit to earn that title. But boy, but he, boy, we used to be fine.

Speaker 1:          01:48:03       It wasn't fine though. Right? Boy was probably always used like especially down south as a derogatory term for young black men. Oh, the white people would always, hey boy. Hey boy, over here. All those fucking Home Depot candle carrying douchebags fucked up. Boy. It's a fun word to great words. Those are my boys now. I can't say that anymore. Definitely say that I have a nine. The token black guy, those are my, those are my men. Hang out with white people just for that reason. All lights, all whites. I get Charlottesville. Fucking, yeah, but Ian Edwards, I can ever say Ian's my boy. Nope. That's not the window. No, but with, with Cody, I don't think Cody's racist. He was like, wait, I boy keep fighting. Like again, you got to know the connotation. You've got to know you're talking to a black guy, so just don't use it like just a minute.

Speaker 1:          01:48:52       Youth Bro. Right? Like if you say that craze, why you guys own bro? You we, we did, but it used to be a black guy thing. No, no. Sub Brow. Nope. Black guys own Bra. No, no, no. That's new, Bro. Was like the 70s back when they had platform shoes on and fucking bell bottoms. Now see, I feel like Becca said brother, they had brother and bro. What up Bro? It really Ross like surfer like that. Yeah, but no, it's like Hawaiian. Your br eight. I'm talking B u h Bruh, Bruh. Ay Bro. Hold up bro. Yeah, that's like from ice tea. I think he probably invented that. Correct. So then they own it. Or should I say ice cube? Which one? Ice Cube or ice teas. A little older. You know what I'm saying though? Like there's different bro. Man. White people fucked up bro though. Races became like a guys who were like loafers go to private schools

Speaker 2:          01:49:49       at Bro. Yeah, maybe like the Frat Boys Bros. Yeah, like guys try a little too hard but not, yeah, now it's a bad connotation because he'd go, oh my God, it's such a bro is over there. I'm like the crazy bros. Like as soon as someone goes, oh, they're such bros, like, oh, I get it bro. Science all the time with Joe Rogan's using bro Science. Vegans love to say that, bro. Science. We know exactly what boroughs. It's a funny thing, but it's, it's anti male and a lot of ways and it's really rude. They, they get upset if you mock anyone that's transgender or anyone that's w a woman or anyone that's gay, but they have no problem calling us bros. Yeah, we've got no problem shitting on the very essence of being a man is throw him out, Bryan out Bryan and now I'm embarrassed to say it then.

Speaker 2:          01:50:42       It's toxic masculinity, man. It's toxic. I mean if I post a picture of his podcasts and went, me and my Bros were getting roasted and getting roasted the borough squad, Bro. It it out. Didn't used to be that way. It's become that way over the last few years when so many douchebags use bro. We did it to ourselves. We did to ourselves. A lot of tools did it cause they took it over and used it here it's not. We were being generous and including ourselves and the rest of the men who fucked it out real. We didn't fuck it up. I feel like we made it cool, but we use brother now. That's my brother. Yeah, brother to other can work. Brother's like, you can't just do the term brother around a guy barely know. Tonight I will be like, oh, what's up brother? You can't do the tricky unless you're hulk Hogan unless you like so friendly.

Speaker 2:          01:51:23       You want everybody to be your brother like Ooh, okay. It could be that guy, man. I don't trust that he's his brother just with anyone. Can I throw it around a lot? If I'm high from high and I meet strangers, so rather you don't have to meet and greets. I say, Bro, what's up brother? Yeah, I see. That's different, right? He experienced something with them. They saw your show. I know a little bit different brothers and the way in a way, hey man, what do you think about this? Tony Ferguson. Kevin Leafy. That's a good God damn fine. I love that fight. Kevin Lee is a bad motherfucker. We took Michael Kia says back and strangled him like he choked him. Yes, I was upset. Maybe maybe he would've survived, but the bottom line is that shit was locked up and it should've never gotten locked up. Well where I come from when you go like this and you and then your body goes limp and your bath to go out.

Speaker 2:          01:52:09       While he was saying, and he was just concentrating on his neck just flexing his that yeah, me too. I was pretend I was asleep when they'll get a punch me in the face. But no, for real. Like if a guy's really good at getting choked and he can figure out how to kind of Tuck his chin and flexes and the neck and just ride out the choke and if he thinks he's got enough air or naked and Kevin Lee, Kevin Lee is a straight up strangler, like that's a strong fucking dude neck. 100% I know. I know. Black belts, man, you get there, you get there and the cheese is, is a black belt young. He's a high level. That's not a black boy. He's not ranked, but he's essentially grappler. I believe he has black belt level in the UFC. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       that's it. He's a black belt level grappling. The UFC, that's fair to say. Oh yeah. I definitely think it's a black belt level. I know it's high level competition, black belts, where if a blue belt gets on your back and they have a full sunken and rear naked choke, there's not much you're going to do. You can hand fight. But if you had to actually in your fuck, especially a strong athletic guy, Kevin Rooney, I get Kevin Leon this and I love Michael. He's a beast. I like all his fights. I just feel like Kevin Leman, I think that the division needs him to, he dresses well speaks well. He's exciting to watch, you know, 100% he's just that the mistake that Mario made and stopping that fight before an absolute conclusion is a big mistake. Oh, Mario fucked up. That's just a joke. It's a choke. You gotta let when you have to let us know, we have to have this argument and then Kevin least like, Nah, just choking him out cheap.

Speaker 1:          01:53:34       James is arguing. It wasn't like you fucked up Mario. Okay. Damn it. Because if Cassa just did go out unconscious, then we've got no debate. And then Kevin Lee has this amazing clean win and there's no bullshit to me though. It was amazing clean wound and we just moved on and went Mario fucked up. But he was going out anyways. What's an accept that? Accept it because they went from fighting and stony first. No they did. And she has a, you're on the undercard. It's a good move too because Tony and um, Kevin Lee were John back and forth to each other, you know, that's a good fight. Very good fight. Kevin. He's a beast and he's a young guy and he's one, he's one of those guys that like you see from his first fight in the UFC, see this giant leaps every here. So yeah, it was a big leap.

Speaker 1:          01:54:17       Calcify thought was going to give him a lot of problems when he took him down, got his back. I was like, Jesus Christ, man and castle and the left hand on him. But when I watch it over in the replay, you know, sometimes when you've seen it live to your, I'm looking through the fence and look at it happen. It's hard to tell what lands it doesn't land. He moved away from it, mostly caught on the end of it, moved away from it and then you know, once they got to the ground it was crazy that he took yes, his back and he dominated the position. Super dominant. The other thing is I find interesting is Kevin Lee, one day he wants to fight, compete after we fight for the past three fights like I want to be in Russia. It's like taking an asteroid superstar, chill sun.

Speaker 1:          01:54:52       Well that's the way to do it, man. You know, asked to fight the scariest fucking guy in the game, you know. But the thing about Khabib is I don't know where his body's out when they're saying his liver shutdown when he was supposed to be fighting. Tony talks about a different game. Yeah. What does that mean? Like so much weight and his body literally was shutting down if I'll fucking Russian goes to the hospital before a fight. We got some serious problems, serious problems. He didn't cut weight right and cut too much too soon. And it's not even that they cancel the five round fight for the interim title and have a three round fight for a catch weight. They don't even do that though. You can't fight. The commissioner was like, Nah Man, it's liver shutting down. This is why when people are like, oh, we got, could be Bruce Connor next.

Speaker 1:          01:55:35       Let's just talk about that. Logistically. You've got a guy who can't make weight, almost died making the way you can go on a world tour against the biggest name ever and mixed martial arts and Conor McGregor. That's going to be your fight and you think college is going to commit to that. How could he do that? Why would he, why would you do that? Not only that, Michael Johnson fight with Khabib apparently at the same issue, but he got through it like they're saying this, the same thing that happened in the Michael Johnson fight. So this means like as every wait cut you do, especially as you get older, apparently your body resists like a sponge. He gets bigger and bigger. It gets harder and harder. You body does not want to do it every time you get fat as fuck in between fights too. You know it was hilarious.

Speaker 1:          01:56:15       Cotsen Ghana was talking about chicks like gaining weight in between fights about you cut all that weight for file, fuck your body up. Like for a woman getting that low in weight and body fat, it's probably even more fucked. The thyroids are fucked. Like, ah, my brother, my sister in law, my brother's wife, she did calm petitioners cut weight and her thyroid light, it just fucks their bodies up. Oh. When they're doing a bodybuilding competition with of all that water weight and height for the girls, like you know some of these girls you'll see in the EOC like the day of the fight, like God, that's a supermodel. You see her three weeks say like, God damn, it looked like a Dell right now that like, how did, like they just blow up like it's literally like their bodies while the body just probably really resist that weight cut.

Speaker 1:          01:57:01       It's just not, it doesn't want to do it. Like, probably your body goes into famine mode. You know, he starts thinking, we've got to retain some water on this bit that's looking for that cyborg fight. Cyborg is trying to fight Holly and Matt Square Guard and that's a big fight. That's a duck cyborg two days ago. And she's like, man, Holly mascular gun. That's what I want. Well that's a try yet where there's some money. You know what I mean? The Holly is coming off the DRN Germane to Rhonda may fight with Joe. She's still, she's coming off down to amend the hock, the banks. I betcha. Yeah, but, but what, but batch go, hey, I was really not in their league in my opinion. Not at all. Whereas your main Miranda may is she cracked your main to randomly with that high kick and then dropped her with that straight left hand.

Speaker 1:          01:57:42       Like Jermaine Duran to me is as legit as Stryker as you're ever going to see men's MMA. So she's not fighting Cyborg. She's Holly to drop her. She just didn't want no part of that. Have you ever seen anything like that ever in mixed martial arts? And I didn't try. Damn, I'm just went radio silent fucking six months and they came back like she did stuff like 10 years ago. I'm gonna cut down a fucking one 35 when I was talking to her post fight and I said, well what about Cyborg? You know I was asking her and doing the post fight interview and she's like, man, I'm going to get some surgeries on my fucking hand hurts right now. Let's talk about this later. Juncker question though. Right? You do have a hurt hand, which I believe she probably absolutely did. Now's the time to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:58:23       Like, Hey I got this title. I definitely know when I have one hand if you're fighting. But she did it do anything right. She was like Nah, that was an excuse she might have. But she vacated the title cause you're like, no, I'm not going to do that. Holly fighting against soon. Yeah, that class she fighting that she vacate the belt was like Nah, we're good side. We'd have fun up there. Holly for Cyborgs and answering fight cause I think stylistically Holly's the perfect matchup to beat Cyborg. I don't think she beats her, but style wise, she's made to beat Cyborg. Thinking about this, let's just go through, think of Holly Beats Sideboard. Whoa. She's aggressive. Make my shot. Female mixed martial artist of all time. Merck. Rhonda with a head kick. So she beats the greatest. Something's grades all the time. Mercer goes on a little bit of a tough run.

Speaker 1:          01:59:07       Who gives a fuck then? Beat sideboards. So beat Ron and Cyborg. We're going sizzler. Yeah. And then me, she'd take, comes back, get get you some. She's whipping her ass for five rounds and then just got choked out at the end. But think about it and then you beat Ronda who was undefeated at them. Then you beat Frickin sidebar. If she beats cyborg and me, she comes back and fight her again. That's a giant fight. It's a giant fight with me. She wants to fight again. She wanted, but she would do it for that. Sitting around Superfight that itch the tonight. Katie Lang poured and poured a shit. Itchy. Fuck. We state still first team all I'll qd up there. Oh yeah, yeah. First team booty hit. Hey, there was a recent, those UFC titties, UFC to ties those. Those are some period you'll see. But with the Holly, if Holly can somehow, again, I don't think she's going to, but you never know.

Speaker 1:          02:00:01       I didn't, you know who? I didn't think she was really going beat Rhonda. But if she somehow can pull off beat Cyborg and she beat Rhonda, did they do we just give her like some weird statute for the UFC gym now? Like how's this work? Either they'll net but you know, don't you think that in their eyes like there's always going to be, even though she beat Rhonda, like Rhonda is the one that put the thing on the map. She's always going to be revered more. You asked. See, I don't think so. I think she has such a crash landing like the worst of all time and she's gone radio silent that we don't remember that that climb. Do you think people are upset and hurt? Like you weren't really a fighter, like you're only fighter for a little bit. If you are really a fighter, you'd still be there.

Speaker 1:          02:00:42       He'd be getting back into it. You're still young people no matter what. No matter what people, where would that kind of shit matter what they thought you were one thing and you fail at it. You fucking loser. I know. They get mad if you were their hero for sure, and you're not doing what they want you to do. Or you talked about being a do nothing bitch, and now you get knocked out and you're, you're doing nothing. You know, it's like, how dare you. I bought the shirt. She was hosting battle of the network stars. No, I don't. Dunno. I don't know man. I don't know. She's just not into it, you know? I mean, I could see not wanting to find anymore. Right. You didn't want to fight anymore at a certain point in time. A little, little different though. You know, she was a world like, she accomplished a lot more than me.

Speaker 1:          02:01:25       Um, you know, I, I, I love my life now has never been better, man. Like I love what I'm doing. I, you know, I don't know. She doesn't have a thing like, no Mary, no. Maybe it was battle of the network stars. I don't know if that's even true. Calling. I can't believe they talked to him to doing that. I Dunno man. You know and also made me, she made so much money like maybe she's good there too. I don't know. But even if you make so much money, it's not about the money is it? Everybody thinks that that's going to be enough to make you happy. It's not. It'll definitely be you in a position where you don't have to worry about bills. Now. Maybe that's your number one problem and then you're going to be happier. That's possible. Once you check that off, the other prompts start to come up.

Speaker 1:          02:02:05       All right, well now what am I going to do? Like I don't have a passion. What am I waking up for? There was a study on income and they, well one of the things they said was when it comes to like overall happiness, see if we could find this. I think they said everything over $70,000 a year. It's kind of a wash at 75,000 right range and like going from, if you grew up from a bike to a car and happiness, when you go from a car to just buy another car and you have two cards, nothing, nothing changes in your, that's not true. I agree with Trump. My corvette and I agree that the fuck you talking about the perfect salary for happiness, a $75,000 a year. When did depend where you live and what you like to do. Yeah. See, I dunno about that.

Speaker 1:          02:02:45       For like the magic income, as people earn more, their day to day happiness rises until you hit $75,000 after that. It's just more stuff with no gain in happiness that someone who's never had a really cool record, he never like had a deck that overlooks the mountain. We real with your buddies, he never been able to go on these dope ass vacation and had a stake in a day traveling to Japan, get some Sushi fresh out of the fucking ocean rise, some master chef, that private jet, you can have some ball times. Hell yeah. Yeah. Maybe you get a fucking yacht, your rent it and go through the Caribbean. Come on, you do whatever you want to get kids. He'd take it on vacation wherever you want. You don't worry about that stuff. The fuck out of here. You trying to say Shit, Dr Phil be just as happy if you made 75 miles an hour. It just depends man. Bitch. Like when you study bro. Yeah. You think Elon Musk be super pumped to go down to about 75,000 a year? I think Oprah has fucking get away cars. We can save 5,000 year. Do you think you would get that top shelf actress pussy. If he was making 75 million a year or 75,000 a year, he gets a million a year. He would be like, damn, I'm struggling [inaudible] 75 mil cut back on my security.

Speaker 1:          02:04:02       They were detailing all the different shit that Johnny Depp's spends money on too and it's just like this stuff. What in the holy fuck he is. I don't know what he does in terms of his substance of choice. That would what he enjoys the appears to be on a financial rampage. Then they have to like take out a loan from his agent or some shit like that. He owns Johnny Depp owns like 40 houses or something crazy, something close houses all over the world. They said it's security is like stupid, like $275,000 a month. Like bro, Bro, you just need one guy who was trying to kill you. He's an animal man. You're fucking captain. Jack Sparrow knows trying to kill you. He's a fucking animal and he's got some sort of a a million a month spending. Well, you know, can I spend money bro? Oh my God. Johnny Depp's x business managers that led, she has outrageous spending. Happy of 2 million a month. You get chose Johnny Depp. You go get yours, dude. How does that happen?

But that 1,000,045 luxury cars, $10 million a year to support his entourage, friends and family, and $30,000 a month alone on why he's awesome Buhler.

Speaker 1:          02:05:32       He's lived a great life though. A matching those months. 2,000,045 luxury cars. 10 is osh. Raj is having a grand old time personal lawyer, Jake bloom. Dep was living beyond his means and urgent earn. Urged him to spend less and sell certain expensive but unnecessary assets to repay loans and pay his taxes and living expenses. He's just out of 14 houses. Listen, that's cocaine living right there. At least in [inaudible] 14 residences acquire, improve, and furnish. 14 residences. I'm trying to see that car collection. 1414 residences, 45 luxury cars. Good Lord. How much money did he make in his career? I owe 650,000 fit million. Sorry, Jesus. 650 million. That's a lot of money, but 2 million a year in the past 30 years earned him an estimated $650 million. Being a rich movie star over does not necessarily bring great financial savvy over the past decade. Mr. Debt paid more than 65.6 million in interest on overdue taxes, has lent millions of dollars to people unlike you to pay him back and has shit and widely splurge.

Speaker 1:          02:06:47       Just, I love that word. Splurge. Just a number of questionable investments, not the least of which is that town near central pay. He bought a town. My man just said, we're balling the town called my manager telling me buying a town. The assistant calls the manager John Johnny's buying the town. He doesn't talk to the man. He was like not so which house do you like? I liked them all. I'll take the time at home. I'll take all have homes. Oh, crazy as that. But he owns a street in Hollywood. I was like a bunch of like Stan hopes his boy. I say that because they're both white and Stanhope cost to go up the street and there's a dude with an earpiece waiting for him and the dude with the earpiece takes from a golf cart and drives them up to the top of the hill and they own like the whole fucking block. But there's one dude on the block that apparently won't sell type move to that guy. That guy's like, Nah, fuck it. I like this house

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       forever. Fuck off type move all coked up. What's a buy it and improve accuracy. It's just make the whole thing just you're going to sail the seven seas and it turn it black. The whole room black. The whole house. I heard, I heard Nicholas cage is even crazier spin. He buys castles and like Ma Knight's equipment and chill. It's good move him and Leonardo Dicaprio. I think we're bidding on some skull and he had to return it because it was stolen or I'm like to him, I forget where I look. That's bald. When he bought a skull from King Tut's fucking in the header return in the museums or art, that's our shit. Leonardo Dicaprio had returned a bunch of art that was given to him by a guy who apparently was stolen. All he agrees to return stolen dinosaur skull to Mongolia.

Speaker 2:          02:08:24       Oh, that makes me feel good. Using stupid purchases. Skull of a tyranosaurs. What does it, what does that word? Tyron source. But Tara, what is that? What's a tyrannosaurus but tar? Do you know what that is? Have you ever heard that before? No. How weird, Bro. How much did those go for dude? We were talking about, Whoa, that's a dope looking animal. He bought the Horace. Horace. Wow. That must be massive. So someone stole it, someone stole it and he bought it and he had to return at the black market. Wow, that's crazy. Where do you put that in your house? Where do you put it? Okay, so here's my thinking. You have to have a real skull. Like if you want to buy some replica, like a child's toy, you're a fucking asshole. Have you have one of those things? You know how like fuck you.

Speaker 2:          02:09:09       It's that real. How dear you, that's what I'm saying. Like if you go to a lot of museums, a lot of the skulls, you're seeing a replica's damn 276,000 better deal. And I thought, what? That's it, Joe, we need went for the new studio Biden. I'm thinking, let's make some bids on a t rex. Let's just have like three raptors at the new studio. Do how much they ain't get about it. How many, what's like the most common domus dinosaur they get by? I bet something lame. But you get like a stegosaurus or chimp because they're fun. Him a little heads. The other begins. They're all small. They have little head and you want to try say tops. Damn. They'll saber tooth ones are bullshit. We ain't trying to have that. Yeah. Saber Tooth Tigers on dinosaur. Jamie. That doesn't, that doesn't count. Make sure they're real.

Speaker 2:          02:09:57       Jamie fives is got a son. Etsy. Hey, free shipping. Free Shipping. $55,000 what is it? What are they saying they have? What does that, uh, that one. What is the, the animal that they can't be real authentic fossil Masa Sore Halley Saurus am Bowl Amborella g m Borghi to deadly duty studio. Yeah, that does look pretty dope. What is that thing? How big is it? 78 inches long, dude. Fucking is that real? That's real. They really have that for sale and we get free shipping right now. That's the thing with Nicholas Cage's things. So it took like seven years for him to get to the certificate of authenticity and then when they got it, that's it and they found out it was stolen by some fake shit. Not Know for a while they had a dope ass. Well, there's one you can get a t rex room 1.8 million. Yeah. I just can't imagine that for 55,000 bucks you should get her.

Speaker 2:          02:10:58       You get a real, is that what it is? How much was it? 250 50 55 free shipping. Not about launching a t. Rex is 1.5 million. If I was like some salt and type character, I'd have all that. I'll run my house like game of Thrones or a t rex go, oh, scroll up 1.8 million. Wow worth it. If you're Warren Buffett, did those go up and your worth 80 billion rides. Like when I have a bunch of that shit in your house by the shit out of that, your wife would just slowly start to realize you're going insane. Start constructing a dinosaur in the middle of the living room and he all of a sudden construction crews at the house like, what's what's going on, honey? Oh, y'all raising the roof. I tried a new t rats comedy. Rex. He's too tall. We're going to have to cut out the ceiling.

Speaker 2:          02:11:40       Every room I'm going to put in glass ceiling out of stock, out of stock. That means somebody who bought it and philosophy out there from Jurassic Park, but I want to, I don't want to rubber toy Janky. You know what I want to, I'll take that Predator thing though. I will take that. What did the, how about this head? Oh, I know a dude who makes those man. The guy who made the American Werewolf Patrick Miguelito, he met a Predator and he makes the alien. Those can't be you. Ooh. Should we get that through? Got a limo.

Speaker 2:          02:12:08       It's trying to pull it up. White diamond premium white diamond. It'd be an asshole. The vibe fish for a million and a half dollars. That depends. What's it? Is it alive? What's he do? What is it? Is it a car? I'm seeing fish. The most exclusive breed in the world. Premium white diamond fish are rare than precious gem stone. Oh my God. So it's one of those things. If you're an asshole, you have it in your fish tank. Let Jeanette is one point $5 million. Just white fish. I did. Yeah. Currently there's only like a hundred of those. If you have an all white moose at your house, he's getting some panty dropper. Here's the thing, man. Here's the real thing. If you're on a hunting trip, okay, that moves is a legal size Mousse and a white move steps in front of you. Do you release that Arrow? They got to shoot that light Mousse in a stupid face.

Speaker 2:          02:12:54       It's, it's totally legal. I don't like the way he looks. So good size moves. Oh, we just couldn't sign his mood. Just going to shoot the Black Moose now, fuck a light moves around. Moves lives matter. I don't discriminate white. I've never shot. The thing is, man, here's the thing about animal rights activists and people that are nutty about animals, they get, what this is is a genetic anomaly. It's not like a, this is a specific breed. Right? It's not out by no though. It's not an albino. Apparently it's just got some weird genetic, uh, anomaly. One of a hundred. Yeah. There's a hundred of them. So what is it like, see what it is. If it says, scroll up a little bit, I think it says what the genetic mutation is. Yeah. See it's a, for coloring is a genetic mutation and it's not an albino, not an albino.

Speaker 2:          02:13:44       Unlike a, like all white animals I heard that tastes like vanilla. They taste good dude. You, you know how to light one that you never even see anyone that's it. Same. Same Shit. Same on the inside. It's like white people. It's all the same. Once you get look at that, wow. It's crazy. Another, some, some people have the string coloring might be another sign of a shore to becoming apocalypse. That damn. And you see a hoard of White Mousse. Yeah. It was only a hundred of them though. I wouldn't tell anybody. I'll tell you one thing. If I did kill that, I'd keep my mouth shut. I wouldn't tell people they'd get too mad even if it didn't matter. Like if you find a bear, okay. Like there's um, a black bear if you're hunting. But first of all, if you're hunting black bear, people get mad at you anyway cause killing a bear.

Speaker 2:          02:14:29       Cause then on round bears they think the bears are extinct or this is a very short loan beers depending where you're at. So many barriers that they're all cannibals. They eat each other. That's a fact. Yeah. The cubs, the cubs like crazy, including the females will eat their own. Tam was saying he has to take out the big older ones cause they'll fuck up all the cup. Yeah. It's actually better for the population to take out the big males because the big males eat carbs like w when we were there. Oh Wow. He's white deer. Moose. I'm going to, those are a little baby white moves. Pigs run off in my car. They're cute as shit. Oh they're adorable. The twins are likely less than a month old show. Cute cuties, little cuties that you'd get and there's a mama big mama is going to achieve. Will fuck with your world.

Speaker 2:          02:15:13       They're different than any other ungulates in that they're real aggressive. Like a moose will chase you down and beat your fucking ass. Super Dangerous. A deer is not likely going to do that. They've done it before. Ah, fuck it. The elk might stab you really with those horns you get, you get a little cocky when he's Horny, you talk blocking and elk. Oh yeah. That's when the crazy, that's rule number one. They will fuck you up. They have swords grown out of their head. See, I'm, I'm definitely doing a hunt like that. Some dangerous where, hey, like I got to watch my ps and qs like we were hunting like baby fond. I can't fuck with you guys. I told Cam, this man has to be something dangerous. I'm down. Okay, well dear. I mean, if they did want to fuck you up with those things, they could stab you.

Speaker 2:          02:15:53       But the thing is they're, they're prey. I mean, this is what they are in nature. They eat grass and they get preyed upon. They are the food source of mountain lions and Wolves and countless bears and countless other animals. I mean that's just what they are. They're beautiful while they're alive. It's not like you should somehow or another, you know, diminish their existence. But that's a prey animal. That's why they're here. That's why they, I mean in the system that they're in the ECO system. Yeah. Yeah. We didn't create it this their and their Goddamn Trisha. So I had some access deer for down last night. I had access to it. But when you posted was I get so hungry, so good. I've been to the girl up blatant. That in my opinion is like the most, if you can get to Hawaii [inaudible] if you can get to Hawaii, that's the most ethical place to hunt because they don't have any predators.

Speaker 2:          02:16:40       So they have to kill these animals. So they have like some insane number of, of deer on Lanai. They have a axis deer on Maui. They have them on a few. I think Molokai has him too, cause there's no predators, predators, none. So the only predators or people, so they actually bring over snipers to take out some of the deer to keep the population numbers down because if the population gets too high, what happens is these deer start getting disease. They start, you know, they, they, they run out of food to eat. The good thing about Hawaii too is there's so much growth, like so much plant growth they can like crazy level. I love it. You are there for your birthday. We're what'd you do for your birthday? Nothing. What a Disneyland took the kids to Disneyland. Just some weird shit. My family, Kim Haines is family. That's cool. Disneyland had a good time. Yeah, I don't, I don't, I'm not a big a party guy. She was still at a birthday part of had your family speak into a video and it'll be a good idea. Right?

Speaker 2:          02:17:33       Still a French press do that anyway. Yeah. I'm not a big birthday day then it's just like, I don't want to be the center of attention like that. It's ironic as that sounds because most of what I do you want to be in the center of attention at some will walk, right? Yeah. But it just seems like he's just weird. Yeah. I'd rather just do a set. Have a nice dinner. Yeah. So went to Disneyland or with the Guardians of Galaxy ride. God Damn. It's fun. I love it. So good. I thought, oh my God, they're going to bit make tower of terror better. Oh, that's right. How chairs my feet. Right of all time. They shit. I'm better now. Really? It's better. I'm not going to galaxy. Well, I really haven't seen it. Go to the galaxies. Right. He'd never saw that movie. It's a fun fucking movie then.

Speaker 2:          02:18:14       I haven't seen Bart too, but I saw apart when you finally saw La Alien Covenant, who loved how good. I've loved old Jimmy. Loved it. A lot of these people that didn't like it. My favorite alien get out of my life. People didn't like that. You've got some shit advice. It was brilliant. Yeah. What'd you say is a bad movie? Alien Covenant. Oh yeah. Click do. I was grumpy. I was crunk for that alien. I, I was, I loved it. I loved swear to God when the movie guys, I stood up standing ovation, slow clap. Everyone else sit down. I love when they made the AI guy gave him, I don't want to say too much spoiler for a grip. It doesn't matter. Some people out there don't have a time. God Damn it. It's been out for how many months you're going to have to like tune out now folks, because we're going to talk about it.

Speaker 2:          02:18:57       Seen Alien Covenant that came out seven months ago. Go ahead and fucked. He has to eat it is to eat it. All right. You do have to tell the story. The one alien, that hybrid alien. Ooh Dude. It was fun. I liked the fact that that the AI guy like they, they cut out as creativity. Right? He started getting weird guilt. So it makes sense. I give you give artificial intelligence the the need and the ability to create. So, but this movie, it went prometheus's first, then this, right? Yeah. Yeah. It was like 10 years after Prometheans yeah, atheists. I liked that too. What was the movie with the alien? They named him Calvin. You don't, I'm talking about and a Ryan we add, fuck yeah, I like that too. I've watched that on every, and I watched them prop that those movies is, there's cut the shit scenes.

Speaker 2:          02:19:44       Like when the guy that you know life one where they're playing with it and they try these experiments with it and the shock electric like, hey come on man, you doing this out in space. Don't you want to bring this back to Earth for you? Start fucking with it. It's an hour secured laboratory. We can't cause you do that. And then look, if we brought that bitch back to Earth then you know what I'm saying? I thought that movie was so fucking good doing things like zapping it and trying to like stimulate. They thought he was dead though. Remember until the his abdomen, he went, Oh yeah, that movie was so tense. He was scary as shit was scary. You know the problem was the gold. They gave him a little bit of a CGI face and I was like, come on. I didn't like that either.

Speaker 2:          02:20:21       Like that demon face. Nah Man, I don't need that. Keep Him Calvin. I liked how they called him Calvin. Yeah, because they couldn't make it to demonic cause then it would be alien cherished, the most demonic. That thing is the most amount of the thing. So scary. Oh, it's awesome. God, I loved that movie. Tongue thing comes out. All this. I like all a slobber and shit that comes out of it's mouth to it. This big giant fucking bug head dude. Have you been to the theater? It's right off. It's in Westwood there. I picked, now you're talking, you get steaks. You can get chicken tenders. I mean you gotta be off your Diet. Where is it? It's a write off of uh, uh, Wilshire, Wilshire, and it's called, I pick like Sydney apolis that kind of shared kind of this huge less now at the VIP.

Speaker 2:          02:21:05       It's going to cost about $60 get in the door. That's the way to do it though. That's it. Sign. Ooh, where's that? That's it. Ooh, it's a small theater too. Yeah, you did take the community, take your wifey there. That's the move, man. Less people. They have all alcohol drinks, who stakes like everything man. Like it. I like it. And you can look down upon the people who didn't buy the VIP tickets. It's cool. And judge out and walk by you. Oh, so there's people below you there. I have regular sex and you're like, get out of here peasants. Move on. Peasant stole. Look at me. What if they talk? Enjoy the movie pass down below. You know they're angry about their position in society. They might. And in the movie theater, I snitch on him. You can ask Niche, which I'm right away. Oh, excuse me. Not false ma'am. Ma'Am. Do you know that there's a system that you can get for your house where it downloads movies as they come out and you can watch brand new movies. I need that chance. They come out cause we're the kid like it, like Annabel the new Annabel Kim. I love scary movies. Like did you see it now? I want, I'm dying to see it. That knew. You seen that new it trailer shit. Your pants scary. It looks Kevin September. Here's how he's moving.

Speaker 5:          02:22:07       People are getting pissed off. I think it's run by Netflix or the same guy that started Netflix started this sort of thing. It's been available for a while at 50 bucks a month, but now it's down to 10 bucks a month. There's some weird catch. This some catches to it like it's only for two d versions and then like you have to pay

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       for a ticket or something and then he get paid back. There's some weird cat. I would pay like $100 a month to watch movies at my house. This is not at your house though? Yeah. This is different than what they was talking about. Sorry. Let's do something totally different. Oh, this is just cheap movie tickets that people are mad about. Yeah, but the house things not cheap. The house thing is a system you get, I think it's like $50,000 and once you have it installed in your house, then you can watch movies as they come out and they're on like a hard drive. Such a movie buff dude. If you had like a home theater. That's what I'm saying. Having a home theater is closed movies cause with a kid it stuff get the babysitter. I see mood like fuck man, I just saw like star wars.

Speaker 1:          02:23:05       You know like it takes a while. Like I'm like I can't wait for that to come out on DVD stuff. Yeah. This thing you can't even see what movies are. I think that's exactly it. You pay for it. So I can't even find most movies that are out. I think that is exactly it and it's very expensive. Like I said, I think it's like $50,000 and it just comes with the service to provide the movie. Yeah, I think you just, it's like a hard drive and you download whatever the movie is that you want to see and you can watch it. I feel like you shouldn't do that now because with technology is coming so fast and, and like Netflix are gone. You know, big movie stars like Will Smith and these guys and Adam Sandler doing these Netflix deals so you don't have to go. The theater is kind of fingerprint reader, finger swipe with liveliness detection, liveliness live ness mean someone.

Speaker 1:          02:23:54       Lots of cut your fucking hand off and have a dead hand that they used to start up your screen. Let's take your fingerprint on a piece of paper or a dead hand will live ness queer just like you see lack of right up there on their fingerprints on it. What kind of a person wants to kill someone so they can see pirates of the Caribbean? Oh Dude, I would, I might kill a bitch. See, see the new edit my house. I'd slice one's finger off at home. Dude, how great would that be? I don't like Jim Ready going out and I want to chill at home. My undies watched all the new movies. He's a real problem is other people when they can't keep it together and they start answering phones talking. I've been at so many movie theaters where people start talking to so annoying.

Speaker 1:          02:24:35       I screw this one will be theater. It was a little urban take that. How do you want a little urban and then the move to homeboy in front of me just on the phone the whole time and people are like, God. And so I go bro off the phone, man, and it keeps going. Puts up his finger like this. I'm like, oh, it keeps going. Go Bro. Moussaka Gopro off your fucking phone. It turns around goes wait till the movie's over. I've been some fights, man. I think I can fight and I the whole movie, all I could think of, I'm like, alright, what am I going to do here? I got my girl here. What is he with all those people, they all look similar. If guests were drift, what am I going to, Durban, am I going to get jumped? Like how is this? I couldn't, I couldn't tell you what movie I saw in fucks your whole experience. I'm just balls deep in popcorn. I'm gonna fuck carbon carbon up. Car bloated carbon movie gets done. He didn't say shit.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       Ah, fuck the whole movie up though. We should have said something. I was stressed. Mm. Just the whole, every middle man, probably three, four years ago, I think. I know I'm thinking if I was you, if I could remote control your body and my cove there smack me in the head. But what happens if there's a bunch band you were with your girl, you know what I'm saying? It depends on how many got, but yeah, that's, it is a very, very rude and disrespectful and be on your phone on Instagram. Like I can see your phone, you're on Facebook and what the fuck you're in the movies. He's a dummy dummy. You're a dummy there. God damn addicted to their phones. Like do you know a few people have the ability to sit through a fucking podcast without looking at their phones? You know how to do it.

Speaker 2:          02:26:05       But a lot of my guests, I see them checking their phones, checking their phones, texting, hold on. Just kind of Texas. So disrespectful. You do that if you're on sports center. Yeah. Right. Especially not now. You know at this in this day and age, but for some people the requirement of an hour or two or in a podcast three without checking the phone, impossible, chill out. You're not that busy folks. It's not that. It's they're addicts, they're straight up junkies. They're getting that little tweak, that little rush of anticipation right that down. If they get an email or text, they say literally we don't, and we don't even know how addicted the phones are, but people, their brains are coming in addicted to it. Just to the sensation of feeling it and the colors and mentions and Instagram and dms. And what's your my phone real quick.

Speaker 2:          02:26:48       Yeah. Let me check my phone. It just seems like we're talking about my mouth to salvation. It's never as fun as talking to friends, but you go to a restaurant, you'll see five people on their phones, not even looking at each other. I hate that shit. When you're hanging out with a friend and they're on their phone all the time, it's brutal. It's like, dude, I be here, can be here, but your phone down, put your phone down. There's some restaurants, they take your phone at the door, you know that fuck. And there's some that give 20 bucks. Then there's some, if you don't use your phone, you get 25% off. If you don't use your phone at all. So your camera's overhead. I don't know how gang checking. Gotcha. No, no, no. You're in the restaurant and you checked it. No, we've got a trick to when I got up from the table now it doesn't count.

Speaker 2:          02:27:26       Don't get the deal. My man, I was taking a shit. I didn't have anything to do. You can't check it. He's still, you checked in the restaurant in the restaurant. I don't know how it works. Taking p fake shit so he could check your Facebook took a fake shit just to check your Facebook addicted son. Yeah. And people are super addicted. You and Joey d has a pretty good about calling. Oh yeah. I called [inaudible] and I take so much of my sometimes you know, sometimes I don't know cause you're busy. So now I'm busy. So you got a tax when you texting novels now we went back and forth. There was a, we had a question, I'm like, okay, I got to hear this. Yeah, we had a talk. Yeah, it's exhausting. Yeah man. There's some people that just, they what for whatever reason are tethered to the hip.

Speaker 2:          02:28:05       And then there's some people that decide they can't use it at all. So they just go straight cell phone. Like, like Putin phone flip phone. Yeah. Sorry. Ari Aziz Ansari as he's Ansari's gone totally off the Internet. I was watching some video with an intern or a no, it was a reading of vice article, I think it was vice. They interviewed them and they were asking about it. He, he is an offline, he's killing, got rid of his social media, really got rid of all his shit. He doesn't do anything. So did uh, ed Sheeran cause he, he appeared on game of Thrones and he got such backlash. He was just, you know, he, he stopped doing it. How many book cons? You have thicker skin flake off line for a few days, Bro. But people are going to use it for what it is, you know, put these trolls.

Speaker 2:          02:28:45       Who gives a fuck everything. Everything. There's nothing that you do to get away from that. Nothing. It is what it is. Go to Kevin Hart's post and it's like fuck you Kevin Hart. Kevin Hart does to many people and everybody having access to everybody being able to communicate with you. If you just decide to swim in that river and you wonder why he got poisoned. Yeah, I agree. The promise with your kids, like even now my son, he wants grabbed my phone and you don't do it like just, he's not going to Twitter and checking dams and Dick pics, but he's like scrolling through everything. Just cause the stimulation. Oh yeah. What was like your daughters and how old are they? Seven and nine. They have phones. No. Do your nine year old does it? No. No, she didn't shut the school. The, I wonder if you give kids phones, you let them see beheading videos.

Speaker 2:          02:29:37       You're letting them tune them on the latest news. They can see that car run over those people, that white power rally and all that shit a kid can see and they're gonna see their friends going to tell them about it. Just think of the shit that you look at. I mean, think of the shit that I, every day I'm posting some new ridiculous video. Someone doing something stupid and some brain damage could like keep an eye on your kids. Hit ninth grade is nine years old is what grade third and they're going into fourth wait til she gets to sixth grade. Yeah. I think like you'd have to be the nerd in school or some, sometimes they didn't have the iPads to write notes and shit. Oh yeah, for sure. And those things go online. Yeah. Yeah. It's one of those things where you got to wonder at what point is it okay to give it to them and how much do you regulate it and how much you do.

Speaker 2:          02:30:21       You do it by example. You know, if, if you're at home with your kids and like stay off the phone kids and you're just like constantly checking on, then they're going to be pissed at you. There should be no phones between whatever, you know, especially dinner time. So it's going to be a beast, man. What do we do with a big thing we do in my house, a lot of art, a lot of arts school constantly, constantly. Like they're always painting and drawing and doing shit. If you give kids that opportunity to do something and then they get like in a pattern of doing it all the time where they're not, you know, their stimulation doesn't cut TV, phone watch TV or no, yeah, we let them watch TV. We don't keep it from them, but we don't let them watch it all day. Yeah. So it's, I think that like, I think especially creativity's important for kids because the more they realize they can make things.

Speaker 2:          02:31:03       Even if you could just make something out of paper machete or something where you're writing something, you know, something that didn't exist, you like my daughter writes stories, like a story that didn't exist. Now the story's written like you wrote it, you created it. Like you realize you read stories, you can also write him, you know, paintings and make a painting, make a drawing. And the more you realize you can create things, it's my thought that it opens up your idea of what's possible for your whole life. You can create things in your life. You don't have to bank on anyone. You can create businesses, you can create a career. You could figure out like how to work hard at something and create it. I also think it's really good for their little brains to like make things. Yeah. For me it's weird because every morning I live across from a school to elementary school.

Speaker 2:          02:31:46       Yesterday was there the first day of school. So there's all these parents dropping off the kids. I was watching the kids play outside. I walked my son every morning. I was thinking, God, how the fuck is he going to make friends like us? All the clicks. I've never thought about ever, ever in my life of that. How this little Duke and I make friends [inaudible] if he doesn't make friends, stay on me. All the friends work, not, you can't be the nerd. He can't, he can't be paranoid and say, give me 10 pushups. Even when they don't make friends that that's good to, you know, realize like what's wrong? Like why aren't you making friends? Like what? Just your behavior accordingly. It won't, don't be the introverted kid who's in balls deep into the comics maybe or fine are the ones who also or yeah, I agree or do and then, and then take over the world like Hollywood, you know, but it's the first time it ever crossed my mind.

Speaker 2:          02:32:32       I saw all these kids playing. I thought, AH, why don't, if he doesn't like France, I got to deal with that. What are you going to do if your son gets older and he is like sort of introverted, kind of nerdy and you see some predatory bitch move in. What if your son becomes like some super successful producer type character and you see some printed, oh my God. Predatory Coyote type woman just not to Leech runs him. Tells him what to do. Oh, oh my God. You see it. You go with the house and you're like, son, you can't let her tell you that. Just nothing. You can do the power of the pussy. There's nothing and do, do you know that feeling that you have when a friend, when you see a friend is getting taken over? Like, like almost like I go like, uh, a pod person, you know, like one of them night of the living dead?

Speaker 2:          02:33:16       No, not, not as Avatar. What does that fucking movie? They, a vision of the body snatchers. Remember hod was under the bed. Never saw the movie. No, dude. Well, there's a couple versions of it. There's a really, really old version for like the 50. It's the new one that, well, there's three. There's a Donald Sutherland version, which is I think want to see like the 70s, which is excellent. A young Jeff gold blooms in that movie. It's a great movie and it's creepy, scary and you know, like good special effects for the time, for the time. And then there's a more recent one with Jennifer Tilly I think is in it or meg Tilly. Meg Tilly. Jennifer Tilly is sister and their paws. Yeah. Yeah. What it is is while you're sleeping, um, it, it somehow or another like the fibers get ahold of you. Like it climbs up. Like if the pods like near the bed, it gets a hold of you and touches you and then it puts you to sleep and starts replicating you underneath the bed.

Speaker 2:          02:34:11       So like while while you're sleeping, it's like draining your body and replicating you. And then in the morning you're dead. You're like a dry hos alien is underneath. Yeah. So this is Donald Sutherland as he's asleep. This thing he had was taking over and recreating him and he woke up before it was too late. Dude, it was adult movie. Let's Kiefer Sutherland. His dad is out of even know that no one knew our Keith. That's what fucked up dad was Donald Sutherland. That's, that's Jack Bauer. Right. If you, uh, if you grow up in your dad's a famous actor and your, you become an actor yourself, you gotta be fucked up. Yeah. It'd be a little weird. That's the end. Oh, that must be the new one right there. That poster. What is that one? Invasion of the body snatchers. Yeah. [inaudible] 78. No, that must be the 78 version.

Speaker 2:          02:34:58       Cause it the newer ones. Oh, the newer one is below that in green. See it in green down there. We'll show. That's the really old one. That's the 1950s one. Ooh Dude. It looks pretty sweet. There was one more that, uh, happened with meg Tilly. I don't remember what year, but I want to say it's like maybe late nights. Don't recreate it already. Yeah, there she is based at the body statutes. The dork report. Bodysnatchers oh, it's just called body snatchers. It's brilliant. Oh really? Yeah. I'll check that shit out. Um, do you know what movie was? That's the porn version. Body starts. You don't move. It was dope. I watched on the plane with 19 1983 that was pretty good, but it's one of those things like you don't even really make those things so many times. What was dope? I watched that movie with Ben Affleck where he gets it.

Speaker 2:          02:35:50       He moved to Tampa. He's like a mafia gangster moves to table this accountant. No, no, no, no. See I thought it was the county I was, I was taking some pills. I was a little out of it. I thought it was the counting and I was like, what the, he counted the accountant and I was like, that's not this. It was something else. That shit was so good. Really? Yeah. He's like, he's involved with the mob and they wanted me to go run the, the Tampa Bay wing of it. So he goes down there. Oh fuck. It was good, Huh? Oh Man. It was fucking classic. Well has it? Yeah. Hi. Where are you? You're high as a kite. I might've been fucking ambien and shit. They don't work on me. Really. I took him in Austria and people are like, only take one. I was like, I'm not that sleepy.

Speaker 2:          02:36:28       So I pop the three of them. I was fucking one eye open just like Ben Affleck's the best ever. Live by gas. 6.4 on rotten tomatoes. Fucking haters are my down after you fucking hate. Why do people hate on athletic? He's goodwill. Hunting. Seems like a Douche though. How dare you ever see his argument with Sam Harris on the bill Maher show now a habit and a very uninformed huge mistake. He argued with Sam Harris about the what? What's in Islam? Well hey listen, I don't want to say stay in your lane. I'm all over the place. But with Ben Affleck, Sam Harris, he'd never seen it. No, it's hilarious cause Affleck doesn't know what to do. So he goes full social justice warrior and starts calling Sam Harris are racist. It's gross. You're so gross. It's so racist. What? Saying it's so gross. And then Sam Harris is like super calm this.

Speaker 2:          02:37:20       He's the problem. Like you can't like yell and argue with Harris because he will never go there. It makes you look in, it makes you look super amateur, especially when he starts spouting off facts on explaining the, we were talking about an ideology. Did Ben Affleck go on there to debate him? I think what it was is he was getting ready for Batman. This is my personal, uh, belief. Uh, it has no basis, in fact, and it's just pure speculation. He was on steroids. He was on steroids getting ready for Batman. You've got jack for Batman. He got jacked. And I think when you get jacked like that, get a little fucking testing.

Speaker 2:          02:37:55       He had, he had no, he had no data. This fuck you bro. About he tried to sling a little Dana. It's Sam Harris, and he just got, just got run over. Oh my God. What do you think? Kings go run over. And everybody was Super Mad at him afterwards. He was like, oh yeah, online. They got torn apart and they just handled it very poorly. I see. I don't get the hate, well, obviously he fucked up there, but I don't get the hate with Ben Affleck. He makes good movies, but Gili. All right, you're fucking to see that. And they go, Ooh, that's the real you. Well, that's it, but is it 3 million? I at him, Rose Lane on steroids. Could be, could be. Couldn't be. I would think that I've never seen him behave like that before, and he definitely got jacked for that movie. And when you're 45 years old or whatever he is, you don't, you just don't get jacked.

Speaker 2:          02:38:43       Like, no, you don't put on muscle. I don't put it on normal. It's not normal you, unless you're on some radical supplements, which if Hollywood called me, it was a kid. We to be Bruce Wayne. I'm going to get on that, but Gotham city cycle, I'm going to get on some of that Clenbuterol to lower my body fat. Oh, I'm calling fucking, I'll release the hounds. I'm a fuck. They won't even need a mask. It's just going to be that yet. Um, he gained 20 pounds, 228 pounds total, got down to 7.9%. Body fat. Ben Affleck's trainer, Walter Norton Junior talks about Ben Affleck's eight. During the day's filming the town, he lost 12 pounds for the town. He was stronger and every lift hate Walter Norton Junior. How would you tell us the cycle he's on? Cattell she the truth thought about testosterone. But if your photo of him with his shirt off at 7.9% body fat, because I think I'm calling bullshit on that.

Speaker 2:          02:39:36       You know how low that is? Very low. He never got that ripped. He wasn't even as ripped as a, the last Batman Christian Bale. Christian Bale coat hanger though. You know, he's real thin now. He got jacked and he's, he's always thin. Um, real low body fat no more. Yeah. I don't think he's an ectomorph. Mesomorph no, I don't know. Well, let's look at him. Look at him next, but I think you're wrong on that. Wow. Let's see. You got a good picture. Pull it up so we can say, show us what do we got here? No, that's not good. Shirtless Atlas or him in a tank top. That him right. He's fucking just one right there. The Rock. Oh, that's the Ra. That's the rocks body. The, my daddy's Jack. That's the rock. Oh, that's fine. Yeah, that's the tattoos. He'll go up to the one right there. That's superman. Is it a dance? Superman. Oh, searing. Mass belly. So Brian's jacked. Ben Affleck is kind of sorted. Jack put Ben Affleck shirtless. That's, that's Ben Affleck. A fucking dad mode though. That's not him shirtless. What's that word there? That's still superman. That's at the BC.

Speaker 2:          02:40:45       Not Buying it. Not Buying it. I don't give a fuck if that was 10 years ago. You don't let me stop. Let me stop this right now. That is so not 7.9% body fat. Go back. Go back to those pictures of him right there. That is not even remotely seventeen's. That's why. That's not more like 20 right? Yeah. Let me just an Argo. Okay. Different movie. Good upper right hand corner. Upper right hand corner. No, that's not him son. That's the wolf from a true blood. Diabetes. Hello? Why are they lying here? Ben Affleck's has ripped sexy. You Jack. No, Chris Pratt got jacked. I don't know if that's real. That's been Africa that Chris Pratt. That's, see, that's not really that jacked. There was a scene of him in, that's how it used to be. He used to be fat. He looked pretty. Looks pretty good. Yeah, but that's not like the rock jacked. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          02:41:40       It's fake. All these are fake pictures. Who was that guy? American Dad. Him and Batman suit son's got a bullshit suit on. So there's, oh, go to homeboy there. Yes. Jake Gyllenhaal. Oh yeah, he did get jacked. You know who else got really Jake Gillen? Damn homeboy got shot. 7% body fat. Yes. That's what 7% looks like. Go back to him now you go into gay porn. Jamie, stop it. I'm just seeing who end have an Affleck or see if it's a guy jerk off to now he's fucking super, just like 10% the San Francisco is so unheard of. That looks like a guy was fighting in the UFC right now, correct? Yeah. Jay and walls with my face. Yeah. See that's the kind of dedication. I don't know if Ben have like, dude, get down to that goodwill hunting. He never saw that and I've never seen that.

Speaker 2:          02:42:32       That's some shit. Now go to Christian Bale. See much more Jack. There's some good pictures of Christian Bale jacked type in Christian Bale. Jack, that's pretty good right there. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Now he's, he just looked more like a guy who could really fuck you up. Then I feel like Ben Affleck looks true. No disrespect, no disrespect. Like right there. Upper left hand car. All right. Ryan Reynolds. First team all by fucking jacked right there is, I mean that looks like a real Batman. Yeah. Oh my God. That's the machinist. That was like one of the worst movies he ever did in terms of like the reception and gone. How many people watched it? It wasn't bad. It was really weird. But the difference between being the skinny guy in the right hand side, which was like him dying. I mean he essentially starved himself, almost a death and then a few months later he's the guy on the left.

Speaker 2:          02:43:30       That's him in the movie. Fuck yeah. He played a guy with narcolepsy. They couldn't sleep, didn't eat. Look how skinny he got, man. He's all good of an actor. Is that fucking, I don't know if that's acting. That's just being a psycho that's dedicated to get crashed into your car. You craft a starving to death. You're really good at it. I mean, that's the mental willpower. It's a, Oh yeah, for sure. But it's really bad for your body. Oh, and it's not good enough. It's not good enough of a movie too. I'll tell you who got jacked was Ryan Reynolds. Oh, he's jacked. Yeah. For Blade two. Oh. Oh yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah. But why wouldn't you do that if you're playing up a fake character? I don't get why you wouldn't do a nice cycle. Oh yeah, for sure. Or you do the, uh, yeah, he was jacked.

Speaker 2:          02:44:17       Or you do the Girard thing. What's that guy's name from 300 butler? Yeah. They just CGI the fuck out of you. [inaudible] story with that. We're 300. They're, you know, they're making a movie. Everyone's doing crossfit nonstop doing the spark workouts and Butler is not showing up. And they're like, what the fuck, man? He's like, I'm not doing this. I don't want to do that. He goes, just tell me when I have to be ready. I will be ready by any means necessary. Like really? He's like, I got this and the didn't do what everyone else didn't came fucking

Speaker 3:          02:44:49       hi.

Speaker 2:          02:44:55       Killed it. Yeah. Well it probably, well, the thing about the, is that really what his body actually looked like, wow, but now he's fucking, he was in there like, what the fuck? He was super jacked and then he let himself go. Wow. It's hard to maintain that. Yeah, that's, he can't mean how much is it? It's real. How much is what he really looked like? Oh, go upper left hand corner. Yeah. Was that okay? That's, that's more realistic. Now there's even a better one. Keeps you look at it. Go to that one set of tits on them. Then I'm so go. Imagine if you're a girl and you're think you're fucking 300 and you get to that God damn and you feel that a hundred pads resting on the top of your ass while I Bang

Speaker 3:          02:45:32       behind this year. Hold up girl. Breast thug is a spartan life. Holy Step fucker off to movie. God, you go halfway limp because you doing coke all night.

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       Mayweather, Mcgregor, we'd probably made some MMA sites. Awesome headlines. Do you have any, any prediction on it? You can't. What do you think in your heart of hearts is what I like? I like shocking results. A shocking result is Mayweather comes out there, underestimates Conor McGregor and Connor puts him at the fucking end of the rainbow. He's, he's dancing with the leprechauns and a pot of gold. How did I get here? Cause he's in fucking dreamland cause he face planted. That's, that's the exciting result. The exciting result is Conor McGregor becomes the greatest athlete the world's ever known and the most famous guy of all time and a MMA wins. I agree with you. All right. That's it man. Love you. That was awesome. You're the best. How can I be the best when you're the best?
