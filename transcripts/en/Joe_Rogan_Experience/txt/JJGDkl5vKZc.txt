Speaker 1:          00:00:03       What the fuck? What the fuck is going on in this world? Are we really slipping away that much? Are we really that far off kilter? Jesus fucking Christmas ladies and gentleman, Chris, is that what it's come to? This podcast is edited for television. This podcast is flying off the rails right from the get go but we have sponsors. One of them is hover and hover is a s website domain name a company. If you want to set up a domain name, it's a great one to use. And in fact I just used it myself a couple of weeks ago for something I'll probably never use, but I'm crazy. Sometimes I come up with an idea and uh, I don't even know where the idea came from. It might have come from marijuana, it might really be marijuana's idea and I borrowed it, but I registered a domain and I did it through hover.com and it was super quick and easy.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       If you go to hover.com forward slash Rogen, you can get 10% off of your domain name. Registrations. Hover is owned by the same people that don't Tang. And what we like about them, the same things that we like about tank, they're trying to provide a service without ripping people off that everybody could use. Indeed. And you know, there's the business is not a bad thing. We just always associate businesses with being a bunch of greedy cunts. And that's why people think of corporations and think of businesses. We kind of all categorize them together. Are you selling me something? Oh well then you must be an asshole. You know, you must have this predatory mindset of just trying to squeeze as much money out of me as possible. That's not how Harvard deals with it. Um, and the way they do deal with it, they just tried to give you a good service and give it to you at a reasonable price and include things a lot of people make you pay for it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       Like who is privacy? So, uh, go and check him out because her awesome. Go to hover.com forward slash Rogen and get yourself 10% off any of your domain name registrations. We are also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com and uh, if you've listened to the show over the past couple of months, you've listened to about all the different shit that Ana is added into its store for a fitness including these, uh, steel clubs and steel maces and kettlebells and a saw, it appears. Look, looks like a soft chin up bar. Decapitate the victims know that that sits on your fucking the door and allows you to do chin ups on the, yeah, it's easy to use it. It latches like it, it rests on your, uh, the top of your door. So you can do chin ups in your house and there's the rope to strangle yourself. That's triangle on anybody. You shouldn't do that. I don't think people, I bet most people that get busted or die of auto erotic expatiation they were really getting set up. Somebody tried to set them up to make them look as foolish as possible. Oh, look at him and his Dick in his hand.

Speaker 2:          00:03:04       I know a lot of girls that would like to be choked the fuck when you're fucking them.

Speaker 1:          00:03:08       That's true. But I think that's sort of a weird freaky domination thing as well. I think, uh, the girls who want you to choke him there, they also want you to fuck up my gear. Some Mongol that just came over the top of the hill and it hasn't seen a woman in six months. Those are crazy bitches. Yeah. But I don't know. I've never jerked off in the Necktie, like hanging off the headboard. It might be awesome first. I'm not going to try with a battle rope. It's definitely, yeah, that's too thick. It's very rough to, it wouldn't be nice for your skin, you know, then you have a collar shirt on it and you'd be irritated all day. My point is, um, all the stuff that we're selling, one of the most important things that I could ever tell you is if you want to use any of this exercise equipment, um, get yourself a trainer and get someone, I don't know how much they cost 50 bucks or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:03:59       Get somebody who understands kettlebells and just not to take you through a workout and necessarily, but just teach you the correct fundamentals of how to use the, the, the, the weights properly, how to lift without hurting yourself. And you don't have to use a lot of weight. One of the beautiful things about kettlebells as you're going to get amazing workout from a 35 pound kettle bell, there's a video that we sell called the extreme kettlebell DVD. Um, it's, I use a 35 pound kettle bell for that thing and he kicks my ass every time. 45 minutes in, I'm ready to throw up. I mean it's, it's really hard to do. It's really hard. You got to have fucking to be hard to use a 35 pound weight. You Pussy. Just trust me cause you're using your whole body. You'd be amazed at how much your own body if you have to just moving your body around doing body weight squats, how difficult that is to do.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       I do 200 bodyweight Hindus, Hindus squats. It's really hard to do when you, by the time you get to 200, you fucking legs are shaking and knock in, you're barely getting through those last 50. Um, it's, it's not, you don't necessarily have to always lift heavy weights or do just the traditional exercises that you've seen, you know, bench press and curls and stuff like that. You know, those, they serve their purpose. But the reality is if you want exercises that help you in athletics or help you with functional strength, um, the, the best ones are the ones that incorporate your whole body. And so that's where the steel clubs come in and steal naces and that's where the like medicine balls and stuff like that, there's a lot of different workouts. If you're interested in any of these things, once you learn how to do the technique properly, there's a lot of different workouts that you can get online on Youtube for free. It's like super easy to find.

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       I have a question, Joe. I don't have doctor laser. Maybe could answer this or not, but uh, I'm not sure if he's real. That's fine. The spider that we showed yesterday, but that was growing the horns. It's actually a fungus virus from the courthouse steps mushrooms, which is one of the main ingredients to shroom sport. So

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       what's that all about? Like, am I going to get us to have horns? Cordyceps mushrooms is also the mushroom that, um, it, it, it makes those ants zombies. You know that, uh, you know that. Yeah. This is a crazy mushroom. It's not any, not only does it make the answers zombies, but it also will be, it will grow inside of the dead ant take over the antibody, grow inside the den. And the other answer recognize it's a threat. So they take it out of town. They literally take the ants body and walk miles away from where their ant hill is. Because if they leave the ant there, if the ant is sick with this mushroom, if he's infected, the amp will climb to the top of the, the highest leaf. It could fine. And then it explodes.

Speaker 3:          00:06:44       And so this is how the army, right? This is how you control the army. And he's just trying to get people endurance when they're doing crossfit. Sorry. You do not have to worry about it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       This is a totally different part or a strain of the quarter sub smasher, right? It doesn't have the Zombie properties. Does it have hints of it? Like a hint of mint? It just a little kid,

Speaker 3:          00:07:02       a little assets, essence of Zombie. Could you imagine if the Zombie apocalypse

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       lips was all started by a fitness supplement? Well, mushrooms are fucked up, man. When you think about it, some of them get you high as fuck. Some of them will kill you immediately. Some of them will give you endurance. Some of them are great for your immune system. You're turning into a dark day, but you're controlling. You're going to have a galactic army. I think Darth Vader just use the forest, so I don't think he had mushrooms involved. Intimidation that mushrooms, you know, Terence Mckenna believed that mushrooms were an alien species for one good reason. The four Fox, four [inaudible] and dimethyltryptamine than this. The scientific designation of it and it's the only is the only plant with a four and the phosphorous position and the known on earth and he believed that it's possible that spores could survive in a vacuum. We like pants. Yeah, that's definitely true. If that's true, it's real possible. If panspermia is real and amino acids and building blocks of life, I've actually come here. Even possibly living things were spores from other planets. Why wouldn't some of have been magic mushrooms son?

Speaker 3:          00:08:17       Dude, you would

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       check the genes for, yeah. Yeah. Well, well, yeah. Well that's why. I mean, how do we know though if Panspermia we checked the jeans, I mean if everything comes from other planets, all kinds of common shit or that random coincidence that something that comes from space is as related to us as we are to like our plants. Like that would be odd. It would be, unless life was pretty uniform. Yeah, that's true. All over the galaxy. There's like coincidental little parts of the DNA and either way, folks, you don't have to worry about that. We had honor and not trying to get you to grow elk horns out of the end of your spider legs turned into Tron, that guy super. He's got a horns coming out of him. I don't hate on superhuman dudes. He's an extra man like neon light, glowy radio.com you fucks use a code name, Rogan and save 10% off any and all supplements. All right, my pal, J D is here. We know this fucker a long time and uh, we're fitting to get busy. Hit The music prime.

Speaker 3:          00:09:23       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:09:25       well, good experience.

Speaker 3:          00:09:35       I met this young man

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       when he was a, what do you, what would you like 17 or something like that? 1717. During the first Houston circle jerk of, was that pre 2001? Was that precepting oh two or something? Was it the Houston circle jerk was out to, um, he was, uh, you were like 17 back then and a high school student. Right now you're like an actual physicist. And uh, his name on my message board, it's WIC. And this is, this sounds like the, the dorkiest beginning of a podcast ever. But, um, my message boards is a very strange place. It's a very odd community and I've tried to keep it as positive and healthy as possible, but there's always going to be a certain amount of constant creeps and there's always going to be a certain amount of obsessed people and there's always going to be a certain amount of Weirdos. But there's also a lot of cool people there too. It's a, an interesting place and a place where some pretty intense stuff gets discussed by some really intelligent people.

Speaker 4:          00:10:33       Definitely. I learned so much, especially in my early years of like being on the board and like 2001 when there was barely anybody on the internet already, but they had all these smart people on your board, like twice my age, having conversations about shit that I had never heard in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       Yeah. And I don't know how it happened either. So the way it happened is very strange. It's like that message board almost like wanted to be born. I don't even remember how I got on it. Well, I don't remember how I got out. I had a free [inaudible] easy board before that. Like there was a whole board before the board, you were on the easy board, right?

Speaker 4:          00:11:08       Briefly, like rally a couple of weeks or something. It was, it was just html, basic comments, thread shit.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       Yeah, it was sue. I wouldn't, yeah, I would need to go back and find that thing. But then it went to this like a different format where it sort of just got spread around and I don't know what happened. It just, all these strange, odd people just started showing up like Voodoo chicken who's been on forever. It was like, yeah, he was a big inspiration in my early years. And he's a good friend now. I mean, uh, I hang out with them every time I go to Seattle and moot. And, uh, you know, so many of these other people that we've met off the angry Amadeus and all these different folks that we've met from the board. And, uh, it just, it's, it's, uh, it's, uh, I know, you know, when I, when I say I don't know how it started, I really don't. And even though it's my board, you know, it has my name on it, I keep it up and everything like that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:00       I guess I'm sorta responsible somewhat to the tone, the guiding force. Like I don't know if you like before you, you instituted the porn role where you had to postpone within 10 posts or you were the band. I don't think like it was already in a, uh, an agreed upon. Yeah. Yeah. People would just get shit that was crescent wrenches. I believe it was his idea. I can't, you know, we're, we're talking about a message board that was started in 1998. That's when my message board was started. Before Facebook, before Google for everything before I can go for my space. Yeah. It was before all that shit. And um, when did, when it was started, we would get all these annoying people and then everyone was assuming everyone was sure that fear factor was going to kill it. This is going to be the 10th of the board.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       His board is going to suck now. But that's when we instituted the porn rule. It was like right around then. It was like right around the fear of failure. We're scared of him. We were scared of the wave of incoming fear factor fans and the porn rule was you had to prove that you weren't a tight ass by by putting porn, some kind of porn during your first 10 to be deemed acceptable too. It's not just like a tiny little thumbnail of some chicks, tits. No. So dudes would completely overdo it where their first, this is my first offering and it would just be Jeff Cox and miles and common phases and fucking gang bangs and then embed videos and then people would just go, well done sir. Well done. Welcome aboard. You know, one day I went and I looked at my board and it was just the most ridiculous fucking resource of porn on the Internet and I'm like, what happened here?

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       And a lot of people like it worked. They weren't allowed at work to use my board because you would open a thread and just randomly there'd be Cox. Any thread could be the least appropriate. It would be to put point in that thread. The more likely it would be that there would be pointing pointed that thread and still is. I mean at any point in time you go to that board, you open a thread, someone's talking to cock and no one takes that out. And you know if my manager found out about that, if they actually went in there and started like going, do you know that there was pornography all throughout your message board? The Tom, Tom, Tom, he would, he would get all Joe Friday on me. I remember one of my favorite points that, I mean before video, so it was just like pictures and a lot of gay porn cause it's hilarious straight people and it was one, it was just a a black dude with like a really small Coty and it was just coated in calm.

Speaker 1:          00:14:30       It was just a little come sash and that just for months. That might've been my favorite thing to just see similar posts. The Internet to me will always be represented by that one photo of that guy spreading his asshole apart with his fingers. But not him. It's a different, it's like a similar, it might not be gutsy, but it's a, it's a guy doing that and they Photoshop the kid's face and the kid's like, eyes are open and his mouth is always like, what the fuck? And right underneath that it says, welcome to the Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:15:03       That will always be the internet. To me, when I think of the Internet, I think of that, this fucking the Internet. I think of the worst things in the world. Goatee or, or Dick Nipples, shedding technicals. Well, we don't even realize that when, well I guess you don't realize it because you sort of grew up with the Internet, but when I was a kid, you'd never got to see any of the things that people are so conditioned to seeing today as far as like dead people. And I mean, I remember when faces of death came out, it was the craziest set. A friend that had a v Vcrs, VHS tape, right? Whatever. There's a called the looking at a dead person was like, oh my God, it's a dead body. Like they're showing dead bodies on a video. By the time you're 16 in America, how many fucking dead bodies have you seen on the Internet?

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       How many people sent you fucked up images of gory things that have happened? Car accidents and wolf attacks and you know, thought fuck man. On just like, right. Like I got on the Internet when I was 13, so like 98. So like I, and I was in Kansas or I lived in Kansas. So like we're a little behind the times anyway. Do you remember that first video of that? Um, the reporter was the reporter or a journalist that was killed during the beginning of the Iraq war. Daniel something or another. But they cut his head off with a knife and they showed his head like they held his head up and you're like, Whoa, Holy Shit. Want to spread the fuck all over the, yeah. That might've been the first, the first be heading on the Internet. I think it, well, I don't think it was just the biggest headache.

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       There was the biggest cause it was a, you know, it was a big deal that this guy was an American who was kidnapped and murdered. But the, the photo, um, there was, or there was a video rather a shorter video that was on an Internet of a Russian, uh, soldiers stabbing a guy in the neck, like holding the guy down with his boot and stabbing them in the neck. And that was the first one that I had ever seen. But by now those, there's this, how many of those are out there? How many of those a Mexican drug lord ones are there with chainsaws? Shit. Now though, like nowadays, like I had like a few years where I just saw every horrible thing that could happen and now I just, it like, you know, it fucks you up a little bit. It definitely does. Do you feel like that's like how like you're, you know, in, in Holland where pot is everywhere and hookers are everywhere, they have the lowest levels of aids, infection or HIV infection in all of Europe.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       They also have the lowest numbers of heroin addiction. And I think, you know, when we had boss root non from Holland he was talking about like they don't have a drinking age like you, like it'd be 12 and have a beer and that because of that we, you know, we're weird if you tell us we're not supposed to do something, we want to do it in really indulgent as a culture, as over cheese. But as a species I think the human animal when you tell us not to do something like fuck you. I mean that's how it is with kids. I mean I you see it so clearly with children when you're raising a little babies and you see them from the get go, like from the womb boom, boom. When you see like cause and effect with them. It's so fascinating that we are hardwired to not want to do what other people tell us to do.

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       So as soon as someone comes along and says don't drink, don't smoke, don't do this, don't do that. Those are the things you want to do. And because of the fact that you never had anybody telling you, hey, don't watch beheadings online because your parents probably had no idea the headings online. If you were a normal person in the 1990s and you were out there working a job, you know you didn't have time to come home and watch beheadings, you know you didn't, you didn't know what the fuck your kid was doing on style project dot Carr to find hard to find some time. But you're a good example of a guy who grew up during the part of the Internet. Like you can't the first wave before anybody understood what was happening, you know, and now everybody's like, they're trying to lock it down and price regulation and tried to figure things out and just like authority figures didn't know where we're going on.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       Nobody didn't know. But like it was still, it was still something nerds did. It was going on the Internet, but you got an email address like why I but and, and if you had a website back then, if you, if you did anything, like if anything got like viral in any sort of a way in a bunch of people downloaded it, you would be crushed with a bill that would fucking bankrupt your whole family. Yeah, I would, I would put out like one blog and someone would read, would, you know, we're re posted somewhere on some famous website and then all of a sudden your bandwidth costs would be fucking insane. Like thousands and thousands of dollars a month, hundreds of megs downloaded from their site. What's wrong with hundreds of megs? Could you see that fit photo that someone had on Twitter the other day of the thing being loaded onto it?

Speaker 1:          00:19:52       You knew it was funny about the message board. Like you said, the rules that you used to have where you had to post 10 photos before you post it, but also the, the, the, there was a website that everyone passed around called black people loves us. So whenever, whenever somebody posted something that everyone has already seen or it's already been posted before, everyone would just be like, black people loves you or black people loves pie or whatever the thing is, it would be black. You bill loves us and then it became BP. Yeah. Yeah. It got so, so stay so natural for us because the black people loves us. Website was so silly. It was just a bunch of white people that were, you know, photos of black people looking ridiculously uncomfortable and it hasn't been updated since it was made maybe 2003 or something like, well we price obviously bringing it up a parody site.

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       Yeah, it's going down. Right. For sure. But that become, it became a, an infraction on our message. If you, uh, if you post something too many times when it's already obviously old, it becomes black peopled. Yeah. It seems so racist, but it's not at all unless you let her side of a black person once hosting. It's not what it is. If you, you need, it's a website. It's in reference to a website. It's not in reference to black people. It's, this is the day, you know, it's uh, I feel like the, one of the weird things that's happened because of the Internet, I feel like people are more sensitive than ever and more quick to be outraged than ever. It seems like even though there's so much crazy shit that you could say at any point in time, and it should give us a, a sort of a broader perspective on things.

Speaker 1:          00:21:30       I feel like people are more easily outrage or at least they'll see it as a green light to plot out. It's like you can be proud of, of identifying victim hood. Yes. Like you don't even have to be the victim. You can just, you can just, yeah. You're going to hurt somebody's feelings. Yeah. You have clout from that. Oh, this is the transgender thing. He's we bringing that up. All right. This is the second biggest story on TMZ, right? Yeah. People are upset. Well, 96% of the people on fucking TMZ agree with me. I typed him. Great Point. I've never seen that far of a sweat. Usually. Usually it's like 42% versus you know, 7% are regarding video contains explicit language. While the video was me and David Lee Roth actually getting, talking about, don't, don't click on it. We don't need to. I'll explain exactly what I said.

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       I'm fully in favor of someone being a transgender person. I feel like you should be able to do whatever you want to do with your body. I'm covered in tattoos. Who, what? You know, maybe for some people that might be more horrific than chopping your dick off. You know, I don't know. I wouldn't, I wouldn't want you to do anything you don't want to do and a, I wouldn't want to stop you from doing something you truly want to do. I don't know how your mind works. I Dunno how your body works. I don't know what's in your soul. I don't know if you, you, you know you have all whatever makes you happy. It's what I'm trying to say. My issue is the mechanical advantage that a female has over a man and people are saying, do research out of a transgender woman or yeah, male rather has over a few wall.

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       Um, the mechanical advantage of male has over a female. The people are like tweeting means saying like, do some research. It's been proven that when a woman takes hormones or bone density decreases and decreases, doesn't even out. It just doesn't, that's nonsense. See that? That's not a woman's hand. Okay, that's, that's way too big to be a woman's hand. And if I chop my dick off, I would still have that. And that's a big one. The Tan, very easily mechanical advantages and the width of the shoulders, the, that doesn't go away. There's mechanical advantages in the strength of the jaw that the way it's built, you can absorb more punches. There's even 135 pound woman who's in really fit, strong, like healthy shape. She's not as strong as 135 pound man who's in fit, strong, healthy shape. We're just built different. The, the advantages will diminish someone with hormone treatment.

Speaker 1:          00:24:00       And, uh, a man who goes through the transgender operation will certainly become more like a woman. But at the end of the day, he has an x, y chromosome that, and that's reality. It's not double x. That's not a woman. That's a man. And if you're happier that way, Dan is fine. If you're a transgender though, you're not a male. I don't that it's driving me fucking crazy. The idea that you're hurting people's feelings by saying the exact correct scientific distinct term for what the fuck they are, which I don't think you're hurting a lot of transient transgendered people's feelings directly. I'm sure. Cause they're mad at me on Twitter. People are calling me a pig there. Call me and asymptotically transgendered people specifically. And specifically because I said that it's not a woman. They're like a transgender woman is a woman. No, you want to feel like you're a woman and that's all good in the hood.

Speaker 1:          00:24:53       But that's bullshit. That's like, it's just where it's just like we're, we're, we're behind the times where like we get to make new kinds of people. Like, I think it's awesome that we can have any kind of that what, this is so crude, it's something new. It's not, not that they shouldn't be called women heard, right. It's like new. It is going to take the whole culture a little getting used to and I feel like it's just the beginning and one day we'll look back on this and mock it the way we look at horrible operations that they used to do. Remember when they used to do hair plugs where they have like doll hair, a circular, they would take a circular plug. I have a friend who has them all over his head. It's, it's, you know, it's very unfortunate because it grows like 30 hairs in one tweet.

Speaker 1:          00:25:37       Just patch. Even like weeds, like a bamboo forest. It doesn't make any sense. Can you get it taken out or anything? Yeah, he could. That's the only way. That's the only thing you can do. You can actually get the, the thing taken out, but my point is that's an ancient operation. They don't do it that way now. Really? That's like really old. You know? It's really old, but that's how we're going to look at transgender operations in the future. There's not gonna be like a physical change with a scalpel. They're going to be able to change your genetically. They're going to be able to actually make you a woman. You will actually put that, and by the way, you might be able to try it out and say, you know what? This sucks. Can I get my Dick back? Boom. And they turned you back into a man again.

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       I mean, I think for the most part we like there. There's clearly neurological differences and somebody that thinks they're a woman like that, it's more similar to a woman. I don't think you can generalize because I don't think it's uniform. I don't think one person's feeling of that. I feel like I'm a woman is the same as another person's. I just don't think how that, I don't see how that can be possible. This is a fucking green light, green light time to cut off my dick. You know? It's like, you know, well, we've looked at your brain. The green light switch is

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       off. We doubt your intentions. What nightclub? They take this photo I when you too. Or is this way? Whoa. We were dancing. You know I don't mind dancing with trainees. That's actually Photoshop. That's not, that's real. We were right there together. They were dancing. Just getting down. Look at her dancing hands. That's the Shittier Photoshop and the one with Lee Harvey Oswald holding a gun. Like tone your face or at least match it. Yeah. No, they didn't want to make it look realistic. People halfass a Photoshop like clearly you can mount up sale chair on that layer. This is tmz.com this is a real website. People go here. Shitty this photo real website. Here's the biggest

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       issue with this whole training thing. That woman, whatever you want to call her. A transgender woman fought three women without letting them know she used to be a man and beat the fuck out of them. Knock them all out brutally quickly and cause damage to their brain. Jesus. Yeah. That's a man. A man beat the fuck out of some women has present anything to it yet. No. You know what, man, look if there's any confusion about me in the gay community whatsoever. It's because of things I've said,

Speaker 2:          00:28:00       but it's, I can see how they would be confused. It's also how I look. It's also what I do

Speaker 1:          00:28:05       do. I'm a, I'm a not just a standup comedian, which are, we were always known for being rude cause we, that's part of what's the art of standup comedy is saying Rude Shit. Sometimes I enjoy people that say root shit. I think it's funny and it's an art form. Just like, I like Johnny Cash singing about shooting men in Reno, but I don't think he really did shoot a man in Reno. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28:25       Robert Johnson singing, chasing is women around with a gun cause she's got a smaller gun then he does. He might have actually done that though. Robert Johnson was living the life. It's still good for him. But my point is,

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       uh, and you know, their connection to the cage fighting and all that, but I am absolutely 100% not homophobic at all. I have gay friends, I have lesbian friends. I do not.

Speaker 2:          00:28:46       Speaking of the board, do you remember that time when you and Crypto or you, you painted your, your fingernail for one of the members of the board? [inaudible] yeah. Then you guys had a little fake kissy photo. If that's true, Joe, then why did you, where's my painting? My words, my gay drawing. I took that down. It was offensive.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       Got bored with it. Man. It's hard to look at behind me. Cartoon of Cock behind you. I don't care what anybody does. I really don't. I'm not, I'm not a homophobic person at all. You know? And that's what something that homophobic. So I always say every racist, I'm not racist. I have a black friend, but I, I really, I grew up in San Francisco from the age seven to 11 and I grew up in a gay neighborhood and my next door neighbors were gay and they used to get naked with my aunt and smoke pot and play the bow, the Bongo drums together.

Speaker 2:          00:29:39       It was so weird, was like

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       weird at the time. Like you're like, this isn't what people use

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       get naked. They didn't show me the Kochs or anything. My, my aunt didn't show me her naked body either, but they let, she let me know what they did. Like she thought it was awesome because she was like, at the time she was probably like 18, something like that. She was pretty young and when she was staying with us and um, you know, she would go next door and smoke weed with the gay guys and play Bongos. I just thought, what the fuck. So like my whole introduction to gay people came really early and it was in San Francisco where it was really accepted. San Francisco was a great place for me to grow up when I was a small boy between like seven and 11. Well, it was a pretty sweet time from San Francisco. Yeah, it was post Vietnam war, you know, everybody had sort of relaxed a little bit and, but the gang thing and the racism thing, San Francisco is remarkably unraced remarkably.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       And I didn't realize it myself until I moved to Florida. When I moved to Florida. Um, I was in school and I asked, I had came home to ask my mom what a nigger met. Oh Shit. Yeah, I didn't, and she was mad at me. She's like, you know what it means? I'm like, I don't know what it means. What does it mean? And she said it's a derogatory term for a black person and I want what I was like, wow. Cause a bunch of kids in my class, we're calling somebody that I didn't know what it meant. So I had to go home and ask my mother. It's because between seven and 11, when I lived in San Francisco, I didn't hear that. I didn't hear it in school. I was in a normal public school mixed with black kids, white kids, Asian kids. I never heard that word.

Speaker 4:          00:31:16       See, I kind of headed different, I just grew up around a lot of really nice white people. So it just didn't come up. Like I, there were a couple of black kids in my school and, but I didn't, I didn't really like pick up on that, that they were different or anything. But it wasn't until I was like 10 or 11 that I realized that the reason there would be Annie, any animosity between white and black people was because of slavery, because that when I was a kid, I was just like, Oh, Europeans took Africans to America to be, to make them slaves and it like the black white thing didn't occur to me. I just knew Africans were brought over here and it didn't realize that they came, like I knew they were darker or whatever, but it hadn't occurred to me that like that was a racial thing. It was just like, oh, Africans were enslaved. Not necessarily black people

Speaker 1:          00:31:58       where, where did you grow up? You grew up in Kentucky, Kansas, Kansas. You might as well, we can talk. It's like, Whoa, what? What's all those flatter? It was realizes that I would never go. It's really nice. Kansas is really nice. They're very polite people. They're very polite people, but not a lot of shit goes on, right? No, nothing that I know of. Barbecue Barbecue's great barbecue and drinking, right? Occasional mechanical bowl.

Speaker 4:          00:32:21       Yeah. About that. I mean, you know, it was, it was the first free state or that was, that chose to be a free state. Really. Kansas was when, when states started getting the choice between being a slave or free state. But

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       would you ever go back there? What if the Zombie apocalypse happened? Then you had a fucking farm where he could hold out. It'd be pretty good. I mean, it's super flat. Chris Hilton. No. What does it say? Condos? Do you sell condos? Do you, what does it say? I just kidding it. Does that, is that like comes supposedly on my face. Paris Hilton. Does he like just puts a couple of drops? I Dunno. I like for his help. I hope it doesn't get mad at me for this. I hope nobody gets mad at me for this cause I'm not telling anybody what to do other than men shouldn't be able to beat women up. You're the best producer ever, Brian. It's probably as good as it gets. I haven't looked around for that reason. He's a gem. Um, so anyway, that was just me explaining my position on gay people.

Speaker 1:          00:33:24       I don't give a fuck. I want everybody to be happy and um, this has nothing to do with that. To me it has to do with the mechanical advantages of being in a male frame. And if you want to consider yourself a woman, that's cool. I think someday we're going to be able to fix anything. I think if you lose your leg, they'll be able to grow your new one. If you decide to be a woman, they'll be able to do that. If you look at what we can do now, we're printing off skull parts, hearts and livers and shit. Crazy. Really creating human bladders, you know that that can be surgically implanted in people. There's a lot of nutty, nutty shit that's going on and it's really going to start wrecking shop on what it means to be a person. Well, you know, someone said, could you ever see what, what's going to go on in a year from now?

Speaker 1:          00:34:07       Well, no, not really anymore. It used to be, yeah, it used to be like in 1978 the most between 1978 1979. What's going to happen was, you know, maybe someone would come up with a new car, you know, there might be a fucking better eight track that was invented. I mean that was, it wasn't a lot of crazy shit going on, but every day there's some new insane invention or discovery or proclamation that makes you go, what the fuck is going to happen a year from now? All these different like fields have been like merging together and computer scientists contributing to neuroscience and everything else. Everybody's helping each other and they've all been developing like really well as their own fields. And there's this weird synergies like Kurt's while going to Google, you know, like he works for Google now. The Guy who wants the technological singularity to include you downloading yourself into a fucking computer, just started working at sky net.

Speaker 1:          00:35:03       I mean, nobody's even pick these dudes are fucking all planning the takeover. And then they brought in Lex Luther, he's sitting there eating a hundred pills with lunch, trying to stay alive for an extra five years. So I love that shit. Yeah, I love Google. I, you know, I keep thinking about how like whatever information they end up being forced to share with the government or something like how much information if they given us, like I got here on Google maps, like half the stuff I like. Everything I look up is on good. They give me information for free all the time. Right. So if they want some mind that's I'm okay with that. Well, honestly I think we're in a state where the ability of the average person is closing in so fast on the ability of the government that they're going to merge sort of like Fahrenheit and Celsius when they hit 40 below zero, the same temperature.

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       I think technology is going to the, the, the boundary breaking qualities of technology and the ability to connect people is going to eventually hit a critical point where it's not gonna matter if you work for the government. It's like I am going to be able to read your mind. I'm not going to need to go to the database that they're building in Utah. I'm going to be able to access information everywhere all the time. There's going to get to that point and you could see like that it's getting away even from the government itself, because look at like what happened? Well, look at what the CIA guy, what the fuck's his name? That that got busted with a the email exchange with the mistress. Oh, the fuck is his name. The big guy. The Big Patraeus. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Betray us. That's to me, when the number one spook the CIA, the number one spa intelligence blasted because the FBI looks into him.

Speaker 1:          00:36:57       I mean, Jesus fucking Christ. They're, they're, they're cannibalizing themselves. The government themselves as cannibalize themselves. They don't know what they're doing anymore than anybody else does in this brave new world is that all this technology and everything, everybody there, especially the ones that are holding onto power, they're in a panic. Yeah, and in doing something like that, I think they showed their pants. I think they dropped their pants and they're idiots. Yeah, absolutely. First of all, because I never knew that the CIA and the FBI didn't get along. Did you know that? I kind of heard things, but I don't know if it was just like an x files thing that's gotta be turned off TV. I don't know. I don't really know. That's the dumbest fucking Shit I've ever heard in my life. You concert supposed to be Americans, you know, and anybody who would dare call someone like me unpatriotic because I think that the government feel mostly with idiots and make terrible decisions based on money.

Speaker 1:          00:37:44       You're, what are you doing? The FBI and the CIA don't like each other. Well you fucks have a softball game and work that out. Jesus Christ. Your whole summary from each other because you don't want this person to move ahead with that person to get a job in the next administration that maybe you think you could've gotten there competing with each other over. What the fuck? It's just like office politics or like, or like a, you know, a hunting lodge or something. Just competing with some other hunting lodge. Like it's just most ducks and then a guy like Dick Cheney shoots his friend in the face. That's what that Shit's from. Be a little more an alcohol. How, how drunk was Dick Cheney? And he shot his friend in the face probably. Fuck, we got really smooth pacemaker thing he's got going on. He's got a heart. But he had a, he had a pacemaker that was so fucking strange that it didn't leave him with a heartbeat as smooth.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       It didn't have a heartbeat. It was just a constant flow of blood. That's gotta be in the Bible, right? The one that, yes, he take you out the heart of another and implanted in this tissue. I just do a joke about how, uh, Dick Cheney had one extra secret service agent that came with them everywhere and the dude was only unhealthy food and they made them jog every day. And he's like, what the fuck? Why can't I have a burger shut up, run. And then they followed him everywhere. He went with a, a giant cooler filled with ice. And then the moment Dick Cheney drops, they got to fucking cut that kind of like a fish, pull out his ticker and stuffed it in that old man's cavity that I wouldn't, I wouldn't doubt it. You know, people would but see soon, just like you were saying, eventually we will all have a cooler full of extra Oregon's just in case.

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       Well I think it's going to be even crazier than that. And they're going to be able to inject something into your body and you're just to agree grow stem cells or the one you have all of a sudden starts functioning like really awesome. You know, 40 beats per minute. I'm more excited about not like fixing stuff but making stuff better. Like I want, I want octopus size or something. I want something powerful. Octopus eyes are very similar to humanize. And one of the weirdest things about octopus is that w we, we branched off from there evolutionary line like hundreds of millions of years. 13 I think the last I saw it was like 13 to 40 times independently and they all use the same crystals and molecules to make the lenses and everything else cause they, cause they work the same for everybody. That's why I was interested in what we were talking about, um, during the commercial part about Panspermia, about the idea of spores and different things coming from other planets and seed and life on earth.

Speaker 1:          00:40:25       If that really did happen, how strange would it be of life really is just sort like this, this is, this is the kind of thing, this is life. This is how it grows. I think when we do find some other life, it will look really similar. Well, could we find here like, look, if you look at like placental and uh, uh, marsupial mammals, like they split or like from an early point and yet you have like placental deer and marsupial deal deer and they have all these like kind of really similar animals because it works the same. So like that's, that's the conclusion you would nature comes to for like some sort of projects. So why wouldn't that work elsewhere? Right. And think about what we know has existed and what currently exists. Think about the immense variety. Like I was playing with my daughter today at her school had this, they have a big bucket of dinosaurs, dinosaur like toys, you know, kids to play with.

Speaker 1:          00:41:21       And uh, you know, she's asked me, well, what's this one called with that. So we're going over the, all the little dinosaurs and I'm like, Jesus Christ, how many of these fucking things were there? And I'm crazy. They, this giant ass flying lizard and it's huge fucking thing with a monster face. And you know, you're looking at all these different things like just the variety of them is so alien. Yeah. They were around for like a hundred some million years. Yeah. And they had all kinds of times, shit that's still here. Elephants and crocodiles and people like just the wide variety that exists right now, but yet, so similar carbon based life form a lot of different variables. Some of them, you know, cold blooded, some warm blooded, some [inaudible] work. And so they keep doing it. Yeah. It's just a wonder if like you said, like it all, it needs similar, but you know, but pretty different conditions I think.

Speaker 1:          00:42:11       I think we'll, we'll, I mean we'll definitely find plants another planet, right? Because chlorophyll is somewhat easy to make and absorbing light from the sun is a really smart thing to do. I don't even have to be the way to do it though. I mean we've shown in this world that in the vents, the volcanic vents, bottom of the oceans where no light reaches at all, they've all, all life needs apparently his energy, we used to think it needed light but all life needs is some sources. As long as there is light, there'll be ones taking advantage of it. Yeah. If there is light and if they're taking advantage of something like sunlight, they're going to do really, really well and the only life that competes with them is going to be going underground to thermal events and shit like that. Like it. If it works really well, then they'll keep doing it right in the, the, the other issue is that the life, unless it comes up with some other way to manufacture things, it's not going to the, the life that lives in the bottom of the ocean near those events is not going to have the same ability to progress is something that there's no stimulation to change.

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       They say that about the ocean, that there's, there's less diversity in the species down there because there's less like a need for change. Like up here we have all this geographic mountains and deserts and forests and lakes and all this other shit. And down there you just have like up and down basically. And then when you get down to the surface Godzilla, oh yeah, that's right. You got to compete with that motherfucker. Oh, you got to go a little shirt on. What are the odds? Crazy. Yeah. Um, from radiation and from its, it was forced to change from Fukushima, well I think it was Gonzolo was nuclear bombs, but I'm sure the Japanese is probably coming up with some new monster movies now. Right. Cause based on Fukushima. Oh, I bet. I guess so you'd have to human gods, Philippine. But I bet a lot of people probably upset that Godzilla wasn't real. Nothing has happened like that. Like no, there's no, see, I told you a moment. Well yeah, that and, and Bruce Banner getting irradiated and Spiderman getting bitten by an irradiated fucking spider. Like that makes any sense. Yes. Unfortunately radiation doesn't really seem to do that. I felt it was very weak that the new Spiderman had a new way he got bid. Oh yeah. You didn't see that? No. No. Why would I just see it bro and new Spiderman movie. How dare you so

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       rude out. Tobey Maguire's dancing from Spiderman three and then I have no problem at Tobey Maguire. Who's being Spiderman in this new guys? Just twilight. I think we've talked about this twilight Parker. That's what it felt like. Like it's all sparkly and it's got good hair. It's just like overdramatic to sexy and it's a love story also. He's a superhero. I liked them. I have no problem with him. Calm though. But so how'd he, how'd he get bit, why'd you say Congo condos? That doesn't make sense. What does that, what did that mean? That condos, a long time ago we talked about condos and I was like let's buy them condos and then I think it for Chrysler or something like that. It was so random access. I was going to say maybe like you were like if Joe was going to have sex with a guy that would be his, his, oh scream.

Speaker 2:          00:45:22       I wouldn't be condos. I bet there's a tumor the size of a bowling ball and that kids had no, I bet there's something in there now. It's in my ass alien and that's why we think there is one in the boat. Me and Ari just started this new research project or you might be able to help us out. When we were talking about it last night that we both realized that we had her but periods the same weekend and somebody told me it might have something to do with the moon at like the distance of the moon is that you actually buy. But what do you mean by out of your ass? Like me and Ari both. Have you guys both go to Chipolte Portland? No. No. It had nothing to do with that. Does this happen so often that you think you could say it on a podcast?

Speaker 2:          00:46:02       We both had our but periods and the photos hall would be like, yeah, I know what he's saying. Like periods too. A lot of people over the age of 35 Oh Brian, I've never, I don't know anybody that's shitting blood unless something really bad happened, but I think you get a, I will ponder this. I think it has something to do. Your research is about, it's about the moon you think? Yeah, I think it has something to do with the distance of the moon because both me and art, so we're going to start like, you know, putting it on our calendars every time we ever bought periods and then you know, see what else we were eating around that time where I was going to put, cause already made this great thing. It's like just put everything that you were doing at that time period. Then after a while you'll see, you have to remember where it was going on.

Speaker 2:          00:46:43       Like, you know, the past day or two before I used it as well. You should just be fucking hemorrhoid. Why are you even debating him on this? This is crazy. Do you start with have hemorrhoids? Oh yes, but they're internal so I don't think, right. They breed inside and then you shit it out. Like coated in a really fine plastic layer of shit. And it's really weird. I think we've already figured this out. But if it happens at the same time as your blood brothers, what you should do is both caught you're assholes pushing, rub them together and then tie him up like an Indian would with some buckskin and you need to stop grinding over and making your butt's make out and rubbing them together. No, that's how you become blood brothers. You gotta tie your ass cheeks together and then,

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       uh, then you have to go through that speech when the outlaw Josey Wales just seeing if there's something that's there, there's iron in your words of truth. It's caught your APP. Not Saying don't do the science. I'm just saying you may. What if there was a connection? There was no science to, I don't know why you talking to this no science yet. It's sort of saying, why don't you have control over is Mike, have you never have you not asked point, not trying quiet. I'm that much trying to encourage him to think that people are actually listening. There's probably better ways to go about this navy. So it turns out, I have to say one thing, it turns out that that story about the Harvard doctor that wanted to implant a neanderthal baby, a woman's body, it turns out it's bullshit. Yeah. Well he, he, he's, yeah, pretty much it's not, it's not bullshit that he wouldn't like to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:27       It's that there, there isn't really a plan. He just said, you know, that maybe we could, yeah. Maybe we have enough neanderthal DNA or whatever that we could do that. Yeah. What happened was Blue Daily Mail apparently picked up on, uh, this guy's conversation or have ever listened to Daily Mail. Yeah. The Daily Mail's a bunch of cunts. These fucks they, um, here, I'll, I'll pull up. Ah, okay. Not True. I'll see your file. I can Google so I can get the whole story. They were just talking about reviving some extinct species that like we kind of killed out a few decades ago. Had just did that with a frog. They just created the embryo of a frog. We had Jacob Board from Popular Science magazine yesterday. Apparently what happened was that there was a, it was lost in translation that it was originally, it was for a, uh, a German language magazine called Der Spiegel and was poorly translated about the possibility of one day cloning a neanderthal.

Speaker 1:          00:49:34       And they just ran it through Google translation. He, you know, and he, when they asked him, the guy said, well, I'm certainly not advocating, but I'm saying that it's technically possible Sunday if it is technically possible someday we need to start talking about it today and that we would need a really adventurous woman. So then they put out this thing saying, asking for an adventurous woman who wants to give birth to him, murdering monkey man, giant eyes. They're murdering. They might've been very peaceful. I think everybody is a murderer back then. Well, there's that too. Wouldn't need, apparently they were, they were very, like, they might have been ahead of, uh, uh, the other group of, of humans at that point. Like they might've been a little more advanced in terms of tool making. And that's why as such a small group, we let them like interbreed with our heart, not with ours, they're both ours, but like they integrate it. The other group that was larger still accepted them because they were so useful. And that's how we got them. The neanderthal

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       blood in us. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50:30       Yeah. There's interbreeding that's a possibility. And the other possibility is just that we share and even more similar common ancestor and that there was a branch, you know, this way and that way and this way. I mean, like Africans don't have the same neanderthal DNA. Right, right. Your opinions and everybody else does. Yeah. Yeah. There's thoughts that humans grew in a variety of different forms, including ones that we haven't even totally discovered it. You know, that, uh, that Homo Floresiensis really throw a monkey wrench into a lot of people's ideas of the human past as well. Cause they found a human, a type of human, this really tiny little human that lived on one island, um, in the florists islands. Is that when it's something like that? Yeah, something like that. There's a weird thing that happens to things on islands. They get smaller except blizzards. Lizards get bigger. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. That's why the Komodo dragon so fucking big and it's all stuck on one. I wonder if that has to do with it cold, warm blooded thing or wonder. But it's a, I, it's called island dwarfism and there's, um, there's like a dwarf elephants and theirs. That's adorable. Yeah. The little adorable elephants. There's all these weird things that happened. There's like little small deer and all these different animals, monkeys and shit like that. But this little human was the weirdest one.

Speaker 5:          00:51:46       Little fucker innate. There's a tiny human next time you got to Houston or anybody in Houston and you should go take out the, the Museum of natural science. They have this huge, huge, uh, uh, Paleontology holiday that just opened up with like a massive train of stories and like 40 some fossils, but they also have this huge history and lineage of, of humans and they have this big light cluster of them and I mean they, they've got like 20 different kinds of skulls or models of skulls in there and all variety of shapes and sizes with big ridges on their heads and shit like that. It's really interesting, which they have this big ridge right in the middle of their head to keep their skull from breaking when they chew on tough things. Jesus Christ and a big ridge to keep their skull from breaking when they chew on the, what the fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:52:33       A lot of the, the hominids ha had this just like a little extra ridge and it was just so when you chew like the way you're, you're bending your skull and shit, it could, it could just crack. Wow. How fascinating is that? Pretty, just think about the, uh, the idea of back then. Did you have no stores? No. No metal, no nothing, no obligations except eating and shit. Fucking like nobody asks you to do anything. You just, yeah. You only lived to be like 18. If you're lucky and you're just running around trying to catch shit to eat. I, although I don't know. I don't know how long it stretches back on the, the age think they like it. If you factor out baby death, then the averages go up a whole lot. Cause it's just fucking easy for a baby. It's dykes. They're so, I

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       mean it, it should be inside a womb and, but the way, the way that we, we develop it comes out of the womb and is still developing. Well, you know what man, it's almost like nature knew that it was a mistake to make people though, like this fucking thing is eventually going to blow us up. Now it's just really hard to make people, cause we're so fucking smart. Yeah, I know that. But it's also the nature said, let's make it easy to kill these fucks. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:53:49       So you're seeing the onion article where they compared the babies of various species like in survival traits. And there was one where they would put the baby on top of a big pile of dirt and let it rain in. Every human baby would just sink in, fucking drown in the mud. All right. I have no kids. And you're both retarded. Yeah. So it goes

Speaker 1:          00:54:12       the, yeah, the, I think that it's easier for people to die because if people could live like easily, if someone could create what humans can create, can be as smart as humans can, can be able to alter their environment as much as humans can and then also be like, is it vulnerables or rhino thinking about how fun,

Speaker 4:          00:54:35       but it wouldn't be, it's not so much, uh, you know, nature meaning it's like, it's a really precarious balance to make it like, you know, like something like a third of our energy consumption through day to day life. It goes to our brain like, and goes to keeping that your bets, Huh? Well he's got all that carbon monoxide in there. Keeping things running, keeping it lubed up. Yeah. Sometimes you sneezing, smokes comes out, he hasn't even smoked. That does happen.

Speaker 2:          00:55:05       No. Like if you smoke a cigarette and then like three minutes later you just pick bourbon and a bunch of smoke comes like, like, Whoa, what the fuck was that dude? It's called cancer. So I just learned something crazy that there's a chemical and Gatorade that's banned in like most countries, uh, from consuming including like Brazil, Japan, Canada, India, because it's bad for you, like fucks with your thyroid. It could get like transfer through breast milk and I could fuck with your neurological impairment or impairment and uh, it does all this bad shit to you and it's in fucking Gatorade and uh, you have to drink a lot of it to call. Um, it's called, uh, let's see. Um, brominated vegetable oil, like bro Broner aid, like bromine. But uh, it's, yeah, it's supposedly though, I guess, uh, um, Gatorade about to remove the ingredient, but you know how long I had been around. I know in this, isn't Gatorade supposed to be like drinking large quantities because you're in sports and you're like getting dumped on your head. And then if it comes true, yeah. But if it transfers to breast milk, like what's it do to the little babies? Your mom drinks, like she's doing yoga and she drinks like Gatorade and then transfers it through a breasts. What would it do to the baby? Probably nothing good. Yeah. Or maybe filter it out. We'll

Speaker 5:          00:56:23       when body's pretty resilient. I don't know ruminated what vegetable oil. It's just something they used the process and I also just found out that equal, uh, just started re released, uh, stick to Stevia version of a Stevia. They changed their formula already have a second brand now. So equal now has stevia. Stevia is way better, man. Yeah, it's a pretty good and he uses an equal anyway. Equal, equal is smart. They would just replace all their equals with Stevia. Well equal as a totally different substance and they own a patent on it. The problem with Stevia is it's just a naturally occurring plant extract. Yeah. But isn't there a problem with every one of them? Like equal might lead to this sweet and low might lead to this. A lot of things might lead to like Tim Ferriss or he says there's no biological free ride.

Speaker 5:          00:57:17       If you, uh, if something tastes sweet, it doesn't do anything bad to you. You should fucking be scared. Yeah, you should be a little Frankie. It's planning, it's camping, camping inside you planning. It's attack laying in a dormant state. There's, I mean, we, we get so over fed on the information because there's like so many things you could put into your body now. Yeah. But we don't, we don't know what it is for like everybody let alone or anybody like, we don't know what Stevia, Stevia is good or bad for everybody. We don't know if this food is good or bad for everybody. Like we're all so individual and we don't know the quantities and we don't have the time to test all this new shit that's out on the market. So we're like over saturated with information that is kind of useless almost. And like how many people have actually died from a lot of the shit that we're scared of?

Speaker 5:          00:58:07       Like who's died from diet coke? Hmm. No, everybody's telling me that aspartame is terrible as per tank as you can. So I'm like, why does everyone have cancer? Because motherfuckers just drink diet coke everywhere. Everywhere you look. People drink. And someone said to me, the, the Tammy Baker and I said, what? He said, Tammy Faye Baker, she got cancer. She drank like a case of diet coke a day. Yeah. That's the other problem. Like you don't know if that did that, especially with medical things. He like, you can't make that connection unless it's like, like the guy who figured out that uh, uh, stomach, there were certain kinds of stomach bacteria or viruses that caused ulcers and everybody said it was bullshit. And so he just took a very large dose of the bacteria and he thought he would wait a few weeks and, and check out, get like a colonoscopy, gastro, whatever. And uh, the next day he started having stomach pains and, and got checked out and he had a bunch of holsters and his stomach and then, and then he went to Nobel prize. Wow. For having the balls to step up. But that that was a very obvious, directly correlated this did that. And 99% of shit is nothing like that. Yeah. And Tammy Faye Baker was fucking Jim Baker, you know, and she was crazy. She was a religious evangelists. Who knows what gave that

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       lady cancer brain cancer. Maybe that's why she was so crazy. I don't know what kind of cancer should cancel it. Right. So I have to correct something I said earlier, a gentleman from Holland said that there is a drinking age, 16 for wine and beer and 18 for hard liquor and it's apparently boss route. And it was giving us dense this information when he said there was no, uh, drinking some like rural area. Apparently he's just very loosely enforced. They're not that, uh, they don't really give a fuck that much, but that's pretty bad ass. You can go to a bar, have a beer when you're 18 or 2016 rather. That's, I said, that's just hiding out in your buddy's basement. You know what I think you shouldn't be able to do when you're 18? I think you shouldn't be able to make a porno.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       I think that the team, but yes, it's the visually, the most to me later. Yeah. But that's when people should be getting watched younger. No, what I'm saying, if you're a girl and um, you know, someone's going to exploit you and make a film with you getting Gangbang by 50 dudes and they're all nuts and your eyeballs, I think you'd have to wait to be 21 point. Make the decision 2142 we coded in common at least three years of dudes lying too, so they can fuck you. Yeah. At least three more years where you go, hmm, there might be some fuckery afoot here. I might be getting hosed literally and figuratively. You know, just so you know, it just, what I saw that miss teen Delaware or whatever it was, was the young girl that did a porn when she was 18, like she's 18. You imagine if we all were held to the,

Speaker 2:          01:00:53       we all just should be judging those people. Like we shouldn't judge people if they want to fuck on or off camera anyway. And if socially we were fine with it, then we, you know, we wouldn't, it wouldn't have been so shitty for her to be found out that she was in a porn like nobody, nobody should give a shit

Speaker 1:          01:01:11       really, except someone hired her, recruited her, do that. Exploited her. Yeah. The summing. Look, if someone owns some multimillion dollar porn company and there were recruiting 18 year old girls and they're profiting off of them, that's exploitation off of someone who's fairly ignorant because they haven't had a long life. There's something about that that I find offensive.

Speaker 2:          01:01:34       Maybe, maybe they should be towards education and not the choice itself. That's 18 year olds are driving around and better cars and all of us though, you know, they're driving a better car than me. He stopped. Well, I mean most people, you know, I mean like a lot of fucking money. They don't make a lot of mine. That's not true. They make $1,000 a scene if they're lucky. Right. It's not a lot of money. It's not like practice for further career. There might be, don't get you're right about that, but you're also riding with like 18 years old, I was getting paid $7 an hour. These girls are getting paid $3,000. You know, it stopped for three hours. So it doesn't mean anything.

Speaker 1:          01:02:08       That's, so they're making enough money to live temporarily. They're not getting rich off of this shit. You're acting like they're driving rolls Royces. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:14       Girls are not making that much money. Yeah. Like their fill all players making millions. How often do they work? You know, if you

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       worked every day of your life, it's $365,000 a year to just get gang bang constantly. But nobody's really going to pay you that anyway. No. And that would be exhausting. Yeah, you would do. You would be dead. You'd be dead by super aids by the time you hit 17. I just think it's, um, it's not that anybody shouldn't be having sex. It's not that. Yeah, that's fair. That taking advantage of other people should be, I guess proper agencies like with few psychiatrists on hand talk with them and try to do the psych work. People want to hit her porn and decide whether or not there they're available or uh, or viable shit. How do you decide to cut out the dumb ones without cutting out the crazy ones? Cause the crazy ones, clearly you got to keep fuck how do you, because some of the crazy ones are awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       Why can't you just have the crazy ones? But how do you, when do you know how to cut someone loose? Go. Yeah, she's just free spirited and you know, what she needed to do was just sorta, she's thinking about hitchhiking across the country where their cousin or, you know, she wants to fuck 500 guys in a day. Let's just let her, yeah, the veteran filming, you know, it's not even necessarily crazy. Just a very peculiar and very significant. Did you ever see that documentary came out a few years back about Annabella Chong? I didn't even know that. She's the one that was the first. Um, and she was the first gal to do one of those crazy gang bang thing. I'm my Jags, she knows her Houston at the age of 21. She had sex with a 251 sex acts with 69 men over a 10 hour period. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:04:04       And it was called the world's biggest gang bang. Since then, gals have a, they've taken it to the next level and they, they, um, now I think like a Houston did like 500 sex acts. They pretend it's 500 guys. But just like these poor guys have to go back for a second sister. I did not know that. And these gals, by the way, if you've never seen one of those Nutty Gang Gang Bang thingamajigs it is fucking in sanity. I mean completely insanity. It's like medical. It's like who's turn is it? Your turn hop on up Phil. And it's completely crazy. There's all these people waiting like my friend, um, um, his, um, Tyler Knight, is this a porn name? We've had him on the podcast for good guy. He wrote a m a blog entry. Fine. Yeah, the great, great stuff. He wrote a blog entry about his time in the line on a gang bang. And he couldn't do it. He couldn't get it up. But it said it was just the most wretched experience that you could ever possibly imagine. And he wrote about like being poor and needing this money and standing in spoons and shuffling his way to the front of the line. And I remember him writing something about how you need to, to bring flip flops

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       to the porn set. Yes. That terrified me right there. Especially certain gang bangs walking through the carpet and the carpet's light. It's not wet until you step on it cause he like, seeps out and then seeps back in. Awful. This Gal,

Speaker 1:          01:05:31       Bella Chong who did this, uh, she was, uh, she's very intelligent. It was really weird. I, and I'm pretty sure that she was attending UCLA when she did this or she went to UCLA or something like that. See now she should totally be USC graduate work gender studies at USC.

Speaker 5:          01:05:49       Wow. Was that her thesis?

Speaker 1:          01:05:52       That's funny. John presented her work in pornography as an attempt to challenge with settled notions of assumptions of what you, yours is about female sexuality. For example, her conception of a gang bang was based on the example of Mess Alina. Uh, wife of the emperor of Claudius historically mess Alina had suffered a poor reputation. The fact that some attributed at least partly to gender bias, according to Chung, she sought to question the devil standard at design. Denies Women. The ability to exhibit the same sexuality as men by modeling what a female stud would be. So she's saying she's a female stud by letting the 69 homeless guys shoot loads and your hair,

Speaker 5:          01:06:33       that's not even a guy that shows up and bank 69 women. You're going to go, hey dude, what are you doing? That dude, I don't know if that, okay, well famously there was that guy with the Houston game pain that like went down on it, right? Brought her flowers number. Like two 71 or something? No. Oh my crimee they brought her flowers. Which do you think is weird or the flowers? It's just she could buy that at a store that, that could even leave that. Well obviously you know those flowers meant something to him, but he went down on her. What if he locked onto a pussy, like a pit bull and it couldn't pull him off and all the other guys and she's screaming, he's biting her pussy. I'm sure it was too slick for him to really, yeah, he's probably a fucking fish. Try catching a fish eye.

Speaker 5:          01:07:21       Has anybody ever jumped in the river and caught a fish with their teeth? Western happened. It must have happened at least once. I had this a Hawaiian teacher and elementary school that uh, he, he told us these stories about like the 15 year olds, I don't know if this was bullshit. I don't think so though. But the teens would like swim out into really shallow waters with like three foot sharks and they would swim next to them and then and bite their eye and when you punched her their eye, they just like, they just stopped moving completely and then you can grab them by the, by the tail and just drag them on cause they won't move or anything. I Dunno. Wow. Bold people before us and figure these things out. Well, once you started swimming with sharks and you're like, ah, sharks are also delicious.

Speaker 5:          01:08:01       They are tasty and there's a lot of meat to those fuckers. It makes sense if you could figure out how to get them on the boat. That's the hard part. Yeah. Sharks tastes good. It tastes like swordfish. I didn't have a lot of things age sharks before. There were boats. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Can you imagine how different the world was until people figured out how to make metal things and me for the longest time it's like, oh, what'd you do? You made a knife with a rock. Congratulations Pussy. You have nobody. Nobody was really worried and then as soon as they started figuring out how to melt down metal, then it was like, Ooh, what can we do with that? Fucking cities within cities, a rubbed guns start going off. Planes are flying, dropping bombs, nuclear fucking re rate the rest of the world that he's crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:08:50       Monkeys. Look at the fuck they did. We got smile. Just figured out how to make metal. That's all metal and then electricity. It's like, okay, we need to put these two together and see what the fuck is up. Very clever on that front too. The nuttiest monkeys out of all time. And although we used to think some pretty stupid shit about like all, I mean we, we used to think cold was a thing and like w cold was a thing with and the way that heats kind of a thing or a descriptor of a thing were hotter things move more. We used to think, oh, it's like a thing. And here did have the absence of heat. Yeah. And they, they would like put buckets of like a uh, ice or something up high and then they would watch the steam roll down and then go see like cold is heavy.

Speaker 5:          01:09:35       Cold is heavier than heat. So that's why it falls. Oh, that's interesting. They didn't realize that. It was just the, the act of just the characteristic steric statistical function of the heat. You know what I found out today that sulfur has to boiling points is a very strange thing that sulfur, when you heat it, it becomes like this liquid. And then if you heat it again, the liquid becomes a solid, like the solid rock solid. And then if you heat it again, it becomes a liquid again. It re re forms into different things. I think that's so cool about like Adams. There's just like three things basically. And um, it's just electrons, protons and neutrons. And you just change the number of those and the behavior radically changes. You have chlorine, which has got like 11, 11 protons in it and it's like a noxious gas.

Speaker 5:          01:10:32       It's like kind of green. It can kill. Yeah. Shit like that. And then you have sodium, which is like 17 protons and it's solid and a, it reacts with water to ignite. It actually ignites with water. And then you put them together and you get table salt. No fucking sense. Well how about the fact that they can take things that are absolutely illegal and then just change a little bit of them and then sell them as bath, salt research chemicals, sir? Research Chemicals. Now remember, we used to be able to get DMT online, not, not, not regular DMT, but five methoxy DMT used to be able to go to the American Chemical Company and by research chemicals, that's what they were calling. There's still places like they cause like their laws are about,

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       uh, you know, they make a law about the chemical and then somebody makes an analog when they change one of the pieces out and then it, it is technically illegal, but not until somebody says specifically that that chemical's illegal. So, so they have that amount of time to sell it and market it or whatever. And then they catch up to it and then they, oh okay, we'll switch out this one and they keep going down the line. Yeah. Well that's what they do with those dick hardening pills to Brian buys these fucking things that like Brian was telling me some lovely stories. The prize of the gas stations, the apparently those are the ones who want the gas stations that are owned by real dude's 76 is the best one to go to. The gas station Shell Shell and seven 11. Don't get the good ones.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       You've got to get the real sketchy joints, liquor stores, those ones that'll bump liquor stores real sketchy jointly. And what it is really is just Viagara. They just buy bulk Viagra or Cialis and it's cheaper for them to sell that. Like they'll sell you a tense night. Incredibly illegal or anything. It's totally illegal. But they don't even get in trouble for it because nobody's doing tests. Yeah, they get two warnings. Warnings. That's awesome. And then that just name the company. But these things, you know, as long as people know they work, like he found out they work in this motherfucker, he's like he's taking stock in the company if you are temporary stock. But if you like, if they were doing that and selling it as Viagara or selling it at Cialis, it's way cheaper. So it's actually more profitable for them to sell. They're nutty Dick Pills and like a little package.

Speaker 1:          01:12:50       So an impulse buy and they're always like right in front of you when you go to pay. They don't hide those bitches. They're right in front next to like the energy pills and you already spending money, you're going to get a pack of gum lighter. Let me get my 30 pills. They cards. Yeah. Um, apparently GNC and uh, um, the company that make Jack Three d is getting sued again cause another dude died. So I think they're going to pull that if they haven't pulled that shit off all stores. I think they're going what was in there like good. All the good stuff. Good. Anything good gets taken away. So we lost a few. Okay. Listen folks, think about how many we helped get rolling the dice every day. Rolling dice. Exactly. I mean, people have died from Viagra to, but people like, you know what? It's worth it. But the old white dudes are in charge and they loved their Viagara and old white dudes are the ones that die anyway and they figure fuck those other old white dude. So I'm tired of this bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:13:48       Yeah. Especially old white dudes just barely hanging on and looking at this crazy stack of cash thinking, okay, what I've got maybe six years left. Who can I put a fucking two right now. I've got a bunch of money and I still don't feel like a man. Just some assistance. Well it would be nice if they actually had clarity and if they realize listening, which just go balls out and then run this bitch right into the, you know, just fucking hit the throttle until we hit the beach. Something more fun. I mean when once you, like if you stopped caring about sex and stop getting hard on like how much shit would you get done? Nothing. Cause you would have no drive. This is what I say one thing for sure. When you stop fucking, you should stop driving at that age. They should, uh, which they should do is instead of a test to see if you know how to drive fucking guy's 80 years old, they should know how to drive and get them in a room with like Alexis, Texas. Okay. And you know your higher yeah. Hired to just gently rub his balls and say sweet things to him and suck on his ears. And if his dick gets hard and, and he can have sex with her, give him his license. If not, get the fuck out of here. I'm super glad to don't run shit and if he can up super glad I'm not serious. But if he could, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:15:03       if as long as even if he could take Viagra and stay alive, he can drive. But if you stop fucking get off the road, fuck off the road, what are you doing? And you getting to just think about what the end, because you're driving around. How do I know you're not just going to hit the fucking gas and drive right into a bank? I don't know. How do I know life is over? How do I know your motivation? I think that's, you know, I mean it's one of the most standard

Speaker 1:          01:15:31       things. What do you think about like angry people standard? You think about them being unfuckable, you know, the no one, no one wants them. They're lonely. They're desperate. Angry people on the Internet. I mean, how much of a cliche is that? The meanest, nastiest, angry people who have zero chance of getting any pussy ass beating their Dixon to the ground on porn, on the Internet, and then yelling at people and no one loves them. Rylands yeah. Then what happens? Huh? Then what happens is poor fox, they get all angry and they get crazy. Get nutty. If we could just find people to fuck them, look at settle the whole thing down. But the problem is they might be your kids. J D absolutely not. Most kids are anybody's kids. It could be anybody's kids. You say absolutely not yours, but one day, maybe so and then one day. What if you know, we need people to volunteer for the armed service in Iraq or the department of motor vehicles to fuck all people. What would you take? Do you want your [inaudible] Glenn? I would want my kid going to the DMV. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, sex above violence. Sex with old is probably violence. Hell, don't blow people up. He's just blow them and keep our roads safe.

Speaker 1:          01:16:53       Keep everybody happier. A lot of people going be happy. Well that's the problem with, with uh, prostitution to prostitution's legal. I mean, somebody is fucking somebody's kid, but I mean somebody who's probably doing that anyway and I kids enjoying it. But what if that kid's doing it for a living? It's good. Are they good at it? To me, there isn't a natural though that we have this aversion to that prostitution. Yeah. I'd been prostituted if I was a girl. No, I don't think there's any, no, get me wrong. I don't think there's anything wrong with prostitution, but I think there is, there's a natural aversion to everything I think are in his gun. Sound fucked up. But I think our system exactly as it is right now is absolutely natural. Our jealousy, I nonsense. Our hypocrisy are every, every weird aspect about our culture from feminism to progressive's to Republican ards to, you know, to the top, to the bottom, from conservative to liberal.

Speaker 1:          01:17:49       I think it's all natural. I think we are in charge of the actual is I'm a wolf colony in the islands valence natural, like aren't we a little smarter than that? Yeah, I would think so. Yes, but I'm not sure because I'm thinking sometimes I think yes we are because we're self aware, but look at how everything continues to move basically in the same sort of interaction. It's the mass. It's definitely moving as one. I'm like, yes, not really paying attention clearly as one despite the massive access to it that we have now and I wonder it's, but I want you to think of that me be, but I wonder if also even that is a part of the process that the access to information like slowly but surely a truth evolves it into another thing and that all of these are natural reactions is just so complex and multifaceted and fractal that from the outside looking in or even from the inside looking out, it's very hard to understand and recognize.

Speaker 1:          01:18:40       That's why all natural, I'm pretty like, I'm not super interested in like getting to, like, I don't want to lead any movements or anything because shit's just like the human race is going to do what it's going to do. And I mean, I could tweak it, but I'm kind of content to just watch and see because it's going to develop or we're going to crash into the dirt. But it, the human race is moving. It's like, like trying to stop a flood. Yeah. Who was it that said that was an Einstein? Someone said that the human races involved in, uh, human beings are involved in a race between education and catastrophe. I don't think I've heard that. Someone said it wasn't Sam. Truthfully, there's someone like him, so great man. Um, I don't remember who the, but I've always felt that when I first read that I was like, yes, that's what I've always felt like, man, I hope we get it together first.

Speaker 1:          01:19:34       You know, like I always felt like when I was growing up, when I was a kid in high school, um, it was the red scare and everyone was really legitimately worried that we're going to have a nuclear war with Russia. Like you'd go to school, you go to history lessons and they would show you Hiroshima and Nagasaki and you know, the effects of nuclear bombs and you're like, whoa. And everybody was terrified when I was in school that we were, and that's where red dawn came from and all that crazy shit. Everyone was scared. Um, but I think sometimes when you look at human behavior, when you look at just even the most fucked up aspects of it, I really do wonder if all that shit is not a natural part of our, like our motivation to, to move forward. Like why would

Speaker 5:          01:20:25       careful how we got here, why we wouldn't be here if we weren't successful. And we have to assume that just about everything that people do is part of that success. Otherwise it would have been weaned out somewhere. So it, so it was useful like for survival. And then the night, now we've got some new,

Speaker 1:          01:20:41       there's also that aspect of humans where we don't really get anything done unless we're desperate, you know? I mean, when do you reactionary, when you're fat and rich and you've got all the money you need, how motivated are you to get up and run?

Speaker 5:          01:20:53       I'm all good. If you live in a warm climate and you've got to stick to pull termites off of out of a hill, like why, why do anything? Yes, you can eat those termites. Well, have you ever, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:21:03       you know those things that people do, like when they lose a job, where they get their shit together, like they get fired from a job and all sudden they'll tell you a year later it was the best thing that ever happened to me and made me get my shit together, made me getting gear. I started pursuing the career I really wanted. Now I'm super happy. But for awhile there, man, I was fucking scared. And that is what motivated people. That's, that's what motivated, uh, I've, I've talked to so many people that have had that issue. Breakups. Do it too. You get dumped and then you realize I am kind of a fucking loser and you need your shit together. It's like it's super

Speaker 5:          01:21:35       common with people. It's not until you get it pointed out to you, you know, like not until he gets scared. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:40       Desperate. Whether you're scared of the Russians, are you scared of the North Koreans? Are you scared of Al Qaeda? It's almost like these sort of scenarios and situations are almost like put in place in order for us to continue, continue this movement as a whole. This bizarre. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:21:56       Yeah. If not that something else, like something needs to come along or, I mean, you know, we, if we keep just doing the same thing over and over and over, as we, as everything else keeps growing, like that one behavior isn't going to fit the same pattern when it's larger. So we have to, it's like switching gears. You've got to constantly find something new to deal with the new environment, steel with new, the new everything. So you a, I know that you listen to this podcast on occasion and I know also in the, you're a very bright young man and also a tad skeptical or share a little bit. Is there anything that really stood out recently? Anything where you were listened to the podcasts were like, yeah. Yeah. Well I, I mean the easy ones career I guess, but we could talk a little bit.

Speaker 5:          01:22:41       What are you trying to say sir? Uh, I mean that guy was obviously a shyster. How dare you, how dare bulls. Are you trying to educate the world about the alien invasion? Possible? Imminent alien invasion doesn't seem as worried and this is perhaps someone else because he's huge. But yeah, he's pretty good. It's got a giant arms and shit. He's ready to fight anybody. He just sounds like all of the other scammers doesn't eat. I got a little bit, uh, he's got DNA evidence. Apparently he hasn't put out soon to be released. I don't think that she is soon to be released. But if the mood, like why would you wait? Skeptical. Skeptical. He's get a DNA. DNA. You remember recently the, the, the, the big foot DNA thing? Yes. Melba catch him. Yeah. Yeah. And you know what they did was they made up, have their own journal and made up their own journal and then you go to the journal and you go to the list of articles and it's just that one fucking article.

Speaker 5:          01:23:42       And even there they didn't put like they don't, why wouldn't you put the information out? Aren't, aren't they? Why aren't these people are always concerned about information about information being free and shit. The, the big foot thing is very funny. I Wa I have gotten to the point where, um, I watch finding bigfoot, I fucking Dvr, Dvr it. And I just fast forward to the parts where they in the woods with a night vision. Cause these mother fuckers never see shit ever. But they'd been on for two seasons now. So it's two seasons of every week. They're in the woods, every week's cheapest shit. Like why would they cancel? It was just two assholes in the woods with some night vision. How that, you'd know that. The crazy thing about that show is that even more so than like storage wars, you know, they're really not finding anything. And if they did find it, you would hear about it on TV.

Speaker 5:          01:24:38       Just like the ghost hunters. Yes. Well the ghost hunters, you know, the ghost hunters are really interesting. I watched a, I don't remember which show it was, but that the guys act, I think his name is Zack Baggins. He's the head guy. It seemed, it was a fun show. They were drinking and doing shots and shit. I was like, wow, this isn't your regular a ghost hunter show. But then they went to this, uh, this place that was supposed to be haunted and they recorded a sound like you could hear like a woman's voice. And I was like, wow, that's fucked. I wonder what the fuck that really was. Whether it's fuckery, whether it's, you know, someone's playing games, whether, whether the house has a memory, but I still have never seen a fucking, something like Gumroad. Deltoros Mama, you know, running the camera like the best, the best evidence they can ever give you is we don't know what it is. Like it's either like you, fos it's, you could point out, oh maybe it was this, maybe it was that. But you can never, it's never any better than, I don't know. Yeah. But the UFO places that they, when the or the ghost places when they go looking for them, they like look for heat signatures and shit like that. And they, they, they wear these clothes that actually have like thermometers on the close to detect cool breezes and shit.

Speaker 5:          01:25:55       Oh, cool. Breeze indicates of ghostly presence. I don't know if he knew that. I didn't know that. You know, you can detect magic with machinery is scary.

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       Cool breeze could be um, a voice from beyond. So every evening I'm enjoying the ghostly manners. Sopping up from a lake side or something. A joke. You posted a photo of you eating a raw horse meat the other day. Why the fuck would you do that? Like, why would you like that? Is this a disgusting? But that's pretty scary to do because of the parasites and shit. No, actually I'm a horse doesn't really have parasites. Well you have to worry about parasites in mostly carnivorous animals. Like you have to worry about parasites and pigs. That's what pigs, it's very important to cook them all the way through because you can get strict, uh, or trigger gnosis. And that's an horse chicken Dosa that's found in horse a lot actually. And Horsley cross contamination. It's probably a shitty a place that doesn't, um, winning, we'll call it, uh, take care of the meat.

Speaker 1:          01:26:58       Right. But, uh, with cows, um, people do it all the time. I think the real thing to worry about the cows, he lie. I don't think you have to worry about tricking houses. Yeah, it should. We do with bears you deal with, you deal with horse. It's actually pretty common. Uh, it also, it's a bait. There's no way for them to test what drugs the horse had had, had, had been given. I had heard my horse had all the drugs, how it helps. Like it could be given some, some, some bad shit. And it maybe, you know what, we, uh, we ended at Joe Beef, this place of Montreal and I had horse meat the last time I was there. I had a like, cooked and this time they served at Ra. We just ate everything they brought over. We didn't question cause they're awesome. These guys are that we had, um, we had veal that wasn't, uh, like when you think of veal, you think of a baby cow that they take and they tie it up and they feed it milk.

Speaker 1:          01:27:48       This was just a baby cow. That's kind of, I was like, man, that's kind of fuck up. They killed his cow young. But then it's like, why is it better lives to be 10? And then they kill it. Like I don't get, it doesn't really, they're killing them. It's not like, you know, it's not, well, it's not like it missed out on like football games and TV. I don't think they traipse through daisies or anything. I don't know how much their life, they're really, I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have done it myself, but they had already killed it, so I hate it. Um, and then they had, um, a bunch of other weird shit that they brought over. But the restaurant, if you're ever in Montreal, you got to go there. It's called Joe Beef. The place is incredible. It looks really good. It's amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:28:26       The horse thing gets to me. I want to just wanna eat horse and to eating it raw. Just I'd like when I was a little weird. It's fucking delicious, man. I'm telling you. It's delicious. It's really tasted ice cream, both cooked and raw, um, that uh, that Joe beef place. Oh, the other thing they have is this thing called the fog was double down. You know how like Kentucky Fried Chicken has that double down where it's too chicken patties and cheese and ridiculously decadent chicken. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The bread becomes chicken. Well, they did that with fall. Guam with Fagua is, um, it's, this should be a better way to say that. It doesn't sound so fucking pretentious. I'm having Fagua Darling in a Chablis. It's a Ross. It's duck liver. They take a duck's liver and it actually became illegal in California recently. My favorite place to get it at this restaurant doesn't serve it anymore because people became p, uh, like Peta and animal rights people.

Speaker 1:          01:29:25       Um, they, they made this campaign, it tried to stop people from doing it because they force feed these ducks, they force feed them and their livers blow up their livers. Livers get huge. And when is it a duck or geese? Duck. Duck. Okay. Right. I think my biggies, let's, let's bow tie V, e, r, a, s, m, whatever it is. It could be both. It's both actually. You've both duck or goose. Um, they, they, they force feed them. They put it like a feeding tube down their throat and they pump them up with food and then it makes their liver grow huge. And then you take that liver and you cook it. What's really fucked up is you can't do that anymore, but you can still eat them so you can still kill him. But now you got to throw away their liver out. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:11       You can't even have like organically harvested, non forced fed. They can't even do liver. No, you just can't eat duck liver. Whether or not it's being force fed. I don't think you're allowed to sell it at a restaurant anymore. I mean I think if it's your own duck. What's that? I just thought it's something, I think if it's your own duck and maybe like you're slaughtering your own duck, you're allowed to eat it's liver, but I'm pretty sure the band is not just because of um, first aid and force feeding. And by the way, if you see a farm, these um, the like these animals actually hover around the force feeding tube because they want to get fed. Well, it's easy. Sure. It's not only that, it's like it looks horrific to us that they take a tube and throw it down. They don't have gag reflexes.

Speaker 1:          01:30:55       They don't look, they don't have an awareness that like all it's doing is making their liver fat like, and we're like, it's so horrible. What about the fact that we're going to cut it fucking head off and cook it? Is that, what should we stop doing that? I mean it's step one to stop doing that. It's what it is. It's like a slow road to someone telling you there's something wrong with it. Like sweet killed all their predators. And then I guess it's our responsibility to be killing them. We asked to kill them, but even if we don't kill their predators, what predators are ducks? How also ducks, her rapist, brutal rubbish. But they don't have a lot of predators. I mean the once we want to bring crocodiles to every fucking pond, the, the number one Predator for ducks as humans, there's really not a lot of other things. Killing ducks. I think cars, you know, I mean, what the fuck is it getting killed by a duck? That just made me really sad killing. I think I've ever seen a duck hit by a car. Really. It's like this and then its feathers and shit and you're not even allowed to pick that duck up and cook it with strange people. I've been talking to, um, you know, I, I went hunting and I shot that deer, that deer head that's right there. And I've had, um, some legit conversations

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       with people that are intelligent people that actually are upset by that. And even people that eat meat. And I'm like, why you, you know that if you eat meat, somebody had to do that. So many different though between knowing yeah. Was right in front of you. Like I'm most me is like unrecognizable and it looks like Plato where something like a steak burger. Yeah. Right. But that disconnect between the person and the act of actually doing the thing and killing the thing anyway. Fuck Wad double down. If you're in Montreal, it's the shit they take. They, they deep fry a piece of fog wall with like Kentucky Fried Chicken type of breading on the outside with cheese in the center. It's unbelievable. It's so good. Yeah. There's a photo of our eating it on my, my not my own on a tumbler, my whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 5:          01:32:55       Uh, Instagram, there's Instagram and there's this group and, and Houston that uh, uh, like once a month they get together and everybody brings like meat and food and they slice it up and, and share like everybody shares all the food they bring in. And the guy that heads it, uh, he, he picked up some rabbits from a pet store and he's been breeding them for food. Whoa. It's pretty neat. Pretty tasty. I had some, uh, it might've been liver or something. I don't know if it's worth a little bit, a little bit, but then you, you come in, you're hanging out with people, you learn a little bit. Some, isn't it weird though this um, this, this distinction we have one way or the other, you know like rabbit, Ooh you're crossing into gray area. But if you kill the cat, hey man, don't kill cats.

Speaker 5:          01:33:39       Like, like there aren't too many cats. Can't kill a dog. But I watched Ted Nugent shoot a coyote and the head today he has traps set up around his property. I think that's actually part of a lot of like the reason people and in urban areas are like environmental activists. Like most of the environmental activist are there cause cause we killed all the unpleasant animals that live in cities. It's just like squirrels and birds tweeting around and everything's lovely and adorable. You never seen a wolf ripping a cow apart backyard. No asshole animals live in the city. We got rid of him. Yeah. So that's your view of nature. It's just really pleasant. I posted this thing about wolves and they got into this sort of debate about wolves when people were talking about, you know, like uh, plans on killing wolves and people here, the tar, how could you kill a wolf? How could you, and then I posted this list of people killed by wolves throughout history and it's a pretty fucking substantial, is that right? The reason why we have these like Little Red Riding Hood and the big bad wolf and all these wolf images in and our past and stories and stuff, it's because wolves were killing people all the time. I mean it was fairly common. There was a time in France where in Paris a wolves killed more than 40 people huffing and puffing and Park in Paris. Mac when it looked

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       like a gangs of New York neighborhood. Yeah, exactly. What that showed. You see this dog or this a dog whisperer video that they posted recently of him getting attacked by a dog? No Way. Yeah, I won't play the audio so it won't, so hopefully you won't get pulled, you know. Uh, but it's called dog whisperer show down with Holly and Holly Band. It gets pretty crazy cause he was saying like how this dog is barking and he'd look like try it bites him right there and then he kicks the dog dog fucked him up. And then if, if after a while his hand starts getting really swol and uh, just starts bleeding, blood just starts pouring out of his hand. His hands fucked right now dog. No, that dog bit the shit out of him, man. I taught clamped on outlook. What's up? Yeah, he's cornering it.

Speaker 2:          01:35:48       He's been standing there for me. See if this works. His genitals right? Yeah. She's still not submissive. Damn. Um, yeah, he's, why would you even get so close to look at that? Oh, he's a strange cat. This guy, you're seeing the things he does with dogs and one of the things he does is he kicks them on the side. Yeah, you just tapped him on the side, which I actually took some on the body that I don't like kick it hard, but my dog and my parents' dog when we're like playing tug of war and I just tap her as she gets pissed, but she doesn't want to let go. Right, right, right. Yeah. When there's a domination, does she bite him again? No. No. Does he see now is when she started smiling? So now you can't look at it took five minutes, but just staring at the dog until he,

Speaker 1:          01:36:30       whatever turns around. Yeah, that's a pussy dog. Try that shit. What a rottweiler or a pit bull that grabs a hold of your hand and won't let go. I a Ui Ouchie Ouchie yeah, that guy. Uh, he's, you know, it's a dog. You can't always get a dog to do what you want to do. Their fucking head. You gotta be a weird dude. Maybe that's what that is. So this a episode of the Ted Nugent show that I watched today. He's a, he's got these traps set up all around his property because he lives on hundreds of acres and he hunts in his yard like Montana or something, right? No, he's got two places. He's got a place in Michigan but he doesn't live in anymore. And now he lives in Texas and in Texas he lives outside of Waco and um, he's got this huge ranch, like hundreds of acres with wild animals running around all over the ranch.

Speaker 1:          01:37:18       And it's Kinda crazy. Like it's a hunting show. Okay. But then it's not really any hunting going on. They sit out there waiting for the animals to show up for the food and then they fucking shoot him. And he does. It's the same show every week? No, it's fishing in a barrel. It's fishing than you toilet bowl. It's taking a carp and throw it into the toilet bowl. It's, it's crazy. I mean, it's a great way to get meat, but I mean, I'm watching what he does everyday. Literally walks to corn, won't do that. He gets into a tree stand. Okay. And he's got a dude with them when the camera and then he fucking leaves the food up and you know, every week he's successful, he gets skunked. I mean this the show, I was on the show, a meat eater when we shot this deer and it was, you know, we had a hike for three days.

Speaker 1:          01:38:02       We're in Montana. It's, it's difficult like you have to pull to actually get a shot on an animal. You have to go through a lot of work to get there. Ted Nugent, it takes 10 minutes. He sits at his tree stand. Every show is the same fucking thing. They come to the food, he shoots them and he's like, can you believe that? He gets all crazy that we got and we got and we got 'em we got 'em like he was right there. If they are coming to eat food, like it's kind of, it's the whole thing is kind of crazy. But he's got, I would hope he gets that excited off camera too. Like that's just him I think maybe a little bit. I mean he look, bowhunting is fun, you know, I'm sure you get a little bit excited, but a little bit is of him being corny for the camera.

Speaker 1:          01:38:42       But before, um, that's the beginning of the episode. Then later in the episode, he's got his dogs with him. He's talking about great dogs are, and then he goes and shoots a coyote, which looks just like his fucking dogs. I mean, they're there. They're real similar, but it's that thing where we make a distinction. You know, we decide like you're my friend. You can go fuck yourself. You're going to eat rabbits that you found from the pet store. Ooh. I don't know how many to cow that I raised. Well, that's normal. You know, we have like animals that are our buddies and animals, like a coyote that looks like a fucking Cali. I mean, how was it coyote that dissimilar from a German shepard or a coyote? Just slightly less friendly. Yeah. Yes. They don't care for us either. Maybe that's part of it. Squirrels are into us.

Speaker 1:          01:39:27       Coyote is not so much. I understand what Ted Nugent is killing the coyote. He's killing the coyote because he has a huge piece of property filled with deer and coyotes eat the Fonz. That's like, um, the, and he was saying that before he bought this property, the people that owned it before him, you know, like that's what you buy. You're buying like these deer management land, uh, things. And the people that owned it before him, they, um, they didn't trap so they never killed the coyotes. So they just, they lost every fall and they ever had, so every year the coyotes would come in looking for fonts and snatch him up. So whenever the, the deers would, uh, give birth, the entire population will be decimated. So all they have is old deer. So he had to go. So, so people don't understand, like why would someone go around and she's tired cause his knee, they're like managing the deer.

Speaker 1:          01:40:16       And yet if they kill all the funds that then what you kill all your deer off to the, you'd have nothing left, but you only need to kill it one or two deer a year. And he's, I think he's got hundreds of them. But the point is like, someone from an urban environment would not understand that. They would say, well, why do you have to kill the coyote? Don't kill a coyote. Okay, you're going to sit back and watch the coyote kill baby deer. What do you, what do you more happy about? Yeah. Then under c that they never have to address nature killing nature. Exactly. Just never have to train and killing nature because we're not nature. We're not unnatural nature killing nature with its face, which I surely do if I could. I certainly four and 14, 50. Um, if you look up wolves of Paris in Wikipedia, there's a pretty, a detailed depiction of what happened in the winter of 1450.

Speaker 1:          01:41:02       Uh, there was breaches in the walls of that's not good of Paris. And, uh, there was one wolf is really fucked up. This wolf was like missing part of its tail. And that was the, uh, the leader of the pack of these wolves. And, uh, they went into the city of Paris and they started fucking killing people. And so they, uh, they, the, the Persians, because 40 fucking people were killed. They learned these wolves into the heart of the city and they stoned and speared them to death in front of the Notre Dame cathedral. It's for Roxanne. Yeah. Throw rocks and spears is, that's all. Yeah. Well I don't think they, they have guns in 14, 15. I don't think so. No, no, no, I think and, and when did they invent the gun? Uh, not that long ago. 1450 was like when it was invented.

Speaker 1:          01:41:55       I mean, that was like bad days for technology and checking on back. 1464, 1464 now. Shit. Yeah. The first gun. Yeah. The first time at Thompson 1464 human history to history cast from bronze. Yeah. Um, that broke all the fucking time. Yeah, those probably sucked with, makes sense though because like a canon is basically a gun. Just a big stupid gun. I like a grant. Morrison, that comic writer, he has a, he has a quote about guns that it's an explosion in one direction. Wow. Even crazy. They had something called the hand cannon from the Chinese. Why you a n? It's won dynasty as one where stick the little match in there. Yeah. And it was like they held it in front of them. It's like a two foot long tube. And that was a, that was 1271. Clever, clever. The Chinese man, that's insane.

Speaker 1:          01:42:55       The Chinese came up with a gun and 12, seven. Wow. They were smart as fuck. And those days when Europe was not something within that, listen to this, the earliest depiction of gunpowder, weapon of a gunpowder weapon as the illustration of a fire. Lance on a mid 10th century Silk Banner. So 9,000. That's insane. And it was a, uh, uh, uh, somehow I guess at the end of it it was like a lance and at the end of it it had gunpowder and fucking did something and shot something out. How proud would you be the first person that like went to their king or whatever and was like, dude, you, you want to look at this? I'm about to get all the bitches, dude, I just flipped the script through the game on its head. Motherfucka I was going to ask you, do you have any questions about the Goswami? Oh yeah. Well, you're a physicist. Yes. Now I feel good. Yeah. Technically less legit than him. Yeah. Well he's, he's written books and shit and then your money. He did a very nice guy. That guy, I would imagine. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:44:04       Interesting cat. Um, no I didn't, I didn't have, um, uh, any, any questions per se. But one thing that I'm actually, you were the first guy to educate me on was the observer effect being bullshit. You know, that's something that like Dr Quantum and all these guys like make a big deal that when you look up double slit experiment, that's the first one. Yeah. It comes up and it's always been that way with the doctor, Colleen, that to people so they know what I'm talking about because that I have said so many people tweet me that dude, do that, check this out. It's amazing. It's dog to quantum to the whole double slit experiment. Yeah. It's really the act of measuring it. The changes it, yeah. Yeah. It will. I mean, because what does it mean

Speaker 4:          01:44:47       measure something? Uh, like say you're measuring the position of something, then you've got to hit it with light and then

Speaker 1:          01:44:54       get a lot of folks who don't even know what the fuck we're talking about. We're talking about Subatomic, um, observing, um, uh, in a subatomic conditions.

Speaker 4:          01:45:03       Yeah, yeah. Just very, very, very, very tiny things that technically you can't see in any other sense. But, but you, you hit it with light and then the light comes back and you know, approximately where it was, uh, because it's, there's actually vertical virtual particles and other southern stuff. You can kind of think of it as, as a, as a little wave function. So there's an uncertainty when you hit it and it comes back and, but when you're not hitting it, it exists in a, in a slightly larger wave function is not exactly a particle. It stretches out a little bit. It's as nothing interacts with it, the uncertainty grows to a certain limit. So it's got some elbow room where it could be. And uh, so the double slit experiment is from when we were trying to figure out if things were waves or particles.

Speaker 4:          01:45:52       And like some people thought light was a wave, some people thought it was a particle in a wave being something that grows outward and it, and it spreads. Like, like when you dip your finger in water and the little circles spread out. That's basically what we thought light did. And we had really good reason to believe that like uh, if I, if I shone some light at your laptop, there would actually be light on you. But like in like white spreads around corners too. So it actually does kind of act like a wave to some certain extent. So if you put, so if you have, and just imagine water, if you have some sort of source like behind a wall with the little slit in it and the sources is causing these waves, the waves go to the water and then at that little slit the waves come out of there and they spread also.

Speaker 4:          01:46:42       And then if you have two slits then, then you know, when you, like when you put two fingers in the water, they were kind of little lines that come off of the two circles where the two circles interact in certain ways. Yeah. You see these little, these little patterns and uh, uh, so we saw, you can see those, uh, uh, wow. I totally lost my train of thought. But uh, so you, so you don't, so they, they, the water goes through both slits. The wave goes through both slits and you get this interference that you can see on the other way on the other side. And if you shoot a particle through, these are at the sleds and it bounces through one and then it comes out and it hits a spot and like shooting bullets through it, they're going to go to a very specific area.

Speaker 4:          01:47:33       But, uh, so you would think that was what that would be what a electrons do. Uh, or any other particle really. But it's not, they, they do waves too. And if you slow it down. So like with light, we were treating these light beams like waves, but if you slow down the light beam so much that only one part, only one little bit of light is going through at a time, it still looks like it interferes. It still creates an interference pattern. If you do that with electrons, it interferes and it still creates an interference pattern. So you don't know which, which slit it's going through, but you know there's only one of them. So you say, well, how could this be? So you set up the experiment to try to met her, which slit it comes out of. And to do that you have a little, a little beam of light watching one of the slits waiting for it to come through or to not come through.

Speaker 4:          01:48:28       But when that light gets there, what used to be the wave collapses down to the particle and then it acts like a particle. And so it's not, it's not that we don't know which slid it's going through. It's that it is going through both when, when we're not interacting with it. So long as they're left to their own devices, they are going through even particles like electrons are going through both slits at the same time. But if you're measuring it, if you're hitting it with light then then they act like particles and, and uh, why is that? Well that's not what I said too, by the way when he was talking about that. Like what about the accuracy of the laser that you shooting on? He's like a hundred percent accurate. Isn't that what you're talking about?

Speaker 1:          01:49:15       No, no, no. That was the measurement of Adam. Things moving like inanimate objects that there's a constant movement in everything he was talking about, you know, millions of an inch shares.

Speaker 4:          01:49:27       Yeah. Everything has it's own little. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:49:30       yeah. And you were talking about accuracy of the measurement of that being the issue now where he's talking about the, the uh, observation of subatomic particles and wave experiments. So, so the, the, the, the two interacting with each other. The measurement, interacting with the particle changes the behavior of the particle. Uh, um, yeah. Yeah. Effectively. But it's not observing like a person's mind. No, you don't need to, nobody needs to be there for, right. Okay. So this is where the issue is with this doctor quantum shit. And for folks who don't know, uh, I know you got real pissed when, what the bleep do you know, came out and I did as well when I found out that that ramp, the guy is, well there's a girl that calls herself ramp. So I thought it was just like, that was her name. She calls. It was funny, it was like, I watched that documentary and I was like, well a lot of people are saying a lot of cool shit.

Speaker 1:          01:50:20       But then there's that weird chubby blonde lady who just seems like a huckster. I'm like, she's seems so full of Shit. Like all my alarms are going off to meaning meaning, but she's in this awesome movie so I guess she's not full of Shit. And then I go and look up that ramp thought is actually a woman who's channeling fucking alien or something from like 5,000 years ago or some shit and she's in the same movie with all these other people and they don't have a problem if they don't even know, I don't think. No. Yeah, they did do a lot of deceit and making that movie. Oh sure. They didn't know. They probably just weren't and wanted to be interviewed on quantum mechanics and they just so excited that people want to talk about some people got quoted out of context. There are certain lens like that doctor, he modo with the water that that detects your feelings and shit like that. Like yeah, that guy has like the message in the water. He has a whole book on that. That's is that quoted out of context? No, no. That guy thinks that. Yeah, he does. That's one of those deals. Are you a different guy? He Moto. Is he full of Shit? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:51:20       I mean I haven't gotten anybody experiment myself. Why don't you try to do that but see, because, well actually he's already explained that you really need to mean it when you're thinking positive or negative thoughts as these, as these, as this water freeze. So I'm, I'm, I, I don't think I would be capable of doing, but I'm fine with that if you can, if he could replicate Vudu if you don't believe in it, it doesn't work for you. Right. But we're talking to is a good question. Probably like what are they even talking about? We're talking about is there was a guy who wrote this book, I believe it's called the message in the water. And what he did was he would like write love on like a bucket of water or whatever the fuck it was or label whatever the container was. And one would be hate one, it'd be love.

Speaker 1:          01:52:01       And he would think about these different things while he, you know, had this water there and then when it would freeze the ice crystals would form completely different geometric patterns. Ugly, ugly, angry, passionate, zoomed in. So you know, you don't know like I don't know if he shipped with show like the whole thing. No, no, no, no, no, no. But somehow we always manage to find a spot. Yeah. I probably just went to the most evil looking ones. It's confirmation bias and a crystal form lunacy. Yeah. But I don't know what it is but, but that guy made a whole book about that Shit. It's really easy to get a book published. Yeah. He's got to prove that he could settle book. Right? Yeah. That's it. Just proof of people it and you know,

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       I mean they already have like the alternative science section or whatever it is. Why doesn't that fucking guy does he, is he tried to do that again or is he, I think he did a, but I mean it's even, it's even hard to like verify in any context. And it is and yeah, I mean it's hard to do but you would think you would think you would be able to develop other experiments where your mind could like just automatically influenced and he, he's been doing this for years but he doesn't, as far as I know, talk about the mechanism of it. Like how does it work? Like what's happening? Like that's the one thing about the mind because it's not, it can't be quantum mechanics because his mind doesn't, what's freezing it to the fucking temperature that's freezing it and he's not bugging it out.

Speaker 4:          01:53:31       I like, and if he was bothering the water at any point you would be able to detect that and the vibration or the heat or something else. And you'd be able to find other real parts other than just a fucking picture. I you would be able to posit some sort of mechanism behind the behavior. And that's what a lot of these guys, they never tell you what it is. Measurable that that is good. Like what's like how do they get their evidence up to par with actual science? Like they don't cause they, they personally don't have that, that criteria of evidence. They're fine with look at the picture and oh it must be true. And they just keep doing it. Yeah. There's, there's a lot of that going on these days. Like, um, when quantum physics sort of came into the mainstream, I mean I guess, you know, fine one was talking about it during the, during the fifties and sixties, right?

Speaker 4:          01:54:22       Oh well quantum mechanics started at the beginning of it, of the 19 hundreds. But I mean like him in Pablo popular culture and pop filing or I don't know about that, the first people to sort of make it a mainstream. Although I don't know how mainstream he was at the time, but he was definitely one of the ones talking about in those, in those days because he was definitely at the forefront of it. Right. My point was that today though, something seems to have happened over the past, like say 10, 15 years where people are like looking for like more mystical answers for shit. Well, it's got a queue in it. And I think that helps a lot because I think if we, yeah, I think if we called it discreet physics, which is what it is, it like people think quantum, it means waves and it means uncertainty and it means fit whatever bullshit you want in, in the cracks of this mysterious physics.

Speaker 4:          01:55:12       But it really just means that things come in chunks, like they're not just waves that like even waves are like pinched. You would think of them as pinched at the end. So they're very well defined. Like waves are very, very well defined. Like exactly, precisely described. Even like we talked about probabilities. It's got a probability of being here or being there, but it's got an exact probability of being here or being there. The probability wave is exact the but the problem, but it's a probability. So we think can just, so they think they can just fit whatever the fuck they want to. But if you call it a discreet physics, nobody would really care and nobody would be interested because it, they wouldn't.

Speaker 1:          01:55:52       It's awesome when it's defined. The the things that we do know about it or so mysterious.

Speaker 4:          01:55:57       There's so many quotes about from people, you know, if you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't, nobody understands, nobody understands quantum mechanics. And it's kind of a term because you can't develop an intuition for it whatsoever. Like the only reason we understand it is the math, right? And the only way you could ever build an intuition from it is understanding the math because it, it's, it's the most Matt, like nobody wanted it to be true in the beginning, you know, quantum physics because it's so fucking weird. But we kept stumbling on all these different pieces of mathematics, all these different parts of these languages that were being developed that kept giving us the right answers and kept saying like you would, they would come up with some, some sort of model and mathematics and they would say, Oh hey, that looks a little bit like this thing we see sometimes.

Speaker 4:          01:56:45       And then it turns out to be true. And then it tells us all these other things when we got all well, that's bullshit. That couldn't be there. And it is because our intuition just sucks at it. But the math is his exact, the math has precise, like it's not mysterious in that sense. Like what? Yeah, there's no, it's hard to say why. Like you can't ask why. That's not the question there. There's, there are certain people that they are the quote, it gets attributed to a lot of people, but it's shut up and calculate is the answer to why does it work that way? How does it work that way? Just shut up and do the math cause you're not gonna think it through

Speaker 1:          01:57:20       very, what is it though that led to this whole, what the bleep do we know sort of ideology behind it. Like it sort of got twisted into the secret and to this idea that you're controlling the world with your mind and that these uh, these possibilities and probabilities are all defined and described in the human imagination. And that's, you know, and that's where they wanted to come up with something like this doctor quantum thing,

Speaker 4:          01:57:46       server changes the experiment. Like, I don't know that the origin of it, but I mean, you know, there's always been ideas about, about, uh, the mind having control over, over reality and things like that. And I think the observer effect and words like uncertainty and quantum and everything else gave them a chance because it's not like they understand it either for the most part, like Goswami does, but 99% of the people you hear talk about it don't understand it at all either. But so the people they're explaining it to definitely don't fucking understand it. So it gives them, it gives them credibility that that isn't theirs. But it, it's, it's science, it's scientific and it's new and all this other shit it, and since I don't know what it means, but I can insert certain of my beliefs within things and then say, oh yeah, because it's quantum and then nobody, nobody can call your bullshit because nobody, it that

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       when Deepak Chopra, um, did you ever see that there was a talk where Depok show Oprah was a, there was a guy in the audience who writing a book with Stephen Hawkings and he start in the, ask them to define what he meant. He's like quantum in the quantum with quantum knowledge in quantum consciousness being non local and quantum. And he goes, well, I understand those words that you said. I don't really know what you're saying. Thank you in that order. It makes no sense. But that's a, that's a weird trickery thing where people use that word quantum and they start tossing it around, you know, that it, it, it almost allows for it 89% of the people listening to it and not going to know what the fuck you're saying. So people just allow you to say it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:59:28       Quantum physics seems like it makes all of classical physics make no sense. Right. So that's a perfect place to put your pet theory. It's a place that is already eliminated the legitimacy of, of all of we what we understand now. Like it's a window of opportunity for them.

Speaker 1:          01:59:46       Yeah. And there's a certain arrogance to that. Oh that woundedness, you know, which always that wound blueness always wants to debunk science that will wound it screamed the mainstream is always wrong. It's time for a change. Well and I could see what they're saying is that science cannot define a lot of the human existence. That's that is, is very real intangible like love and emotions and experiences and you know, but we are getting there getting close. Right? Yeah. Getting real good at that. But their idea of, you know, science is being this, this rigid, you know, non understanding numerical sort of approach, which it can be whenever anyone's in any sort of a position of power, whether a new scientific formula comes by the way of some people who either haven't done the research you've done to describe it and they're skeptical lie occasionally they make up data. Sure. Remember when a cold fusion, when everyone's was a hot on the cold fusion trail and people were claiming to have, uh, created cold fusion. Yeah. There's always weird things like that where people not sure, but at the end of the day, science is responsible for every single fucking thing that's in front of you.

Speaker 4:          02:01:08       The flaws of it come from people not from, not from the method itself. Yeah. That's cause that's the funny thing. Whenever, whenever something like that gets overturned, like when somebody gets in, science gets corrected or found out that they were making, making up data or doing, doing shady shit or they were mistaken or anything like that. It's never these people complaining about mainstream science that correct them. It's always other scientists. Yeah. Because that it's a self correcting thing. It's it as so long as you no presumption except that if you keep asking the universe it will give you the answer. But that's

Speaker 1:          02:01:46       dia behind science is brilliant. The idea behind the, the understanding of the world due to measurement is perfect. The real problem is the fucking humans measuring it and the ego and all the other nonsense that comes along with being a person. And that's where people tend to get upset. And that's where, you know, the quantum Wu talk sorta like fills the gap by the people that are disenchanted disillusioned by the system, the rigid system that they see not being able to understand psychics are Tarot card reading astrology.

Speaker 4:          02:02:22       Yeah, exactly. And it's like, you know, astrology has been around for thousands of years and they never told us anything about those stars

Speaker 1:          02:02:31       and the Ching, the Chinese method of divination. How long has that been around and how much, you know, I've always wondered about that. You know, the, the idea that there's been methods of divination that people have used throughout history and one theory is that in order to bypass the, the human ego and our limited grasp on the understanding of the world that we live in, there's a certain amount of knowledge that can be pulled out of any sort of a situation by a method of divination. And that what you're really doing by this method of divination is allowing the universe to give you data.

Speaker 4:          02:03:09       I think because I mean most of our brain isn't part of the conscious part but, but it's still thinking like nobody really considers that. But like your subconscious mind is thinking all the time and communicating all the time. It might be doing, it might be juggling certain thoughts for like weeks and then gives it to you fully fleshed out and you're like, oh, I just had a brilliant idea. Right? The rest of your brain has been thinking about. So, and it's take interpreting and taking in a lot of information and a lot of different ways that it's not telling you about because you don't need to know about it. So in certain senses, our intuition can become extremely useful. Like especially with dealing with people, like there's all sorts of stuff going on with other people's faces and body language is that you don't have to know about to pick up on and then go, that guy's a creep and I don't know why. It's because other parts of your brain are doing this thinking for you.

Speaker 1:          02:04:01       Yeah. That is the weirdest thing. When someone's being shifty and you, if you tried to explain, explain subtle shiftiness to someone, you know when you're talking to somebody like get the fuck no, you can't get in my car. That weird feeling where you just felt like someone's just fucking shifting, but try writing down on paper and try it.

Speaker 4:          02:04:20       What tools on their pupils dilating their cores swelling up? Like, I don't know,

Speaker 1:          02:04:25       just the weird social scenarios that you're getting from the one that, the tension from the communication where you know that they're trying to keep it together or would they or they might hit you. You know that weird you're had been around someone you think is going to hit you. There's that weird charge in the air, like a, you might hit me right now, like I, I feel some weird shit going on here. Try describing that.

Speaker 4:          02:04:47       Yes. I mean, so, so I think when it comes to like, like certain things about like a shaman type characters, like dealing with people or community issues or even to some extent like nature, like maybe their body is picking up on the fact that like 20 years ago there was a flood for a really regular reason and now it's coming up again or something like that. Like they could have an intuition that they don't know about, but they've been working on it. They've been trying to develop their intuition so much. Like that's what they do. So they keep working these parts of their brain until they are actually good at something. They have no idea what they're doing. Huh. Just like anything else, they keep working it and keep trying to be intuitive, like cold reading and stuff like that. Like you keep doing it and you keep getting good at it. And whether or not you even know that that light, you're, you're, you know, you're, you're manipulating these people around you telling them about their dead relatives or anything and you get good at it. And it's not because you're getting a stronger intuition with dead people. It's because you're getting stronger intuition with them, whether or not you're actually doing it deliberately.

Speaker 1:          02:05:54       Yeah. I, I think that any person who's a huckster, if you have been deceiving people for, you know, x amount of years and pulling shit out of your ass or x amount of years, you're going to get good at it. Just like anything else, you probably do get sort of an idea of like your grandmother, Mrs You, my grandma died last year. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:06:15       And they're, you know, there are people that have prime. They're already, they're thinking about their dead.

Speaker 1:          02:06:19       What always fascinates me, I've had a friend that, uh, he's, he's gone to psychics before and he's like, dude, you wouldn't believe man, she knew everything about me. Match, just totally legit. Starts telling me about the psychic and I go, did she know anything that you didn't know? He goes, no, like a little fucking good. As she's telling you, she's telling you some shit you already knew about your all family perfect. He just, he just paid to have someone remind you of your memories. So the dumbest things ever size that wolf. Oh my God. Wilson one shot. It's crazy. It was fucking scary, man. Can we just killed them off. We killed them off in America for the longest time, but thankfully now because of animal activists, they've reintroduced the wolf, they're decimating deer populations throughout the metro.

Speaker 4:          02:07:07       That desire for control, it's really strong in us. Like even even, you know, progressive people, kind people. It's that, that desire to control. Cause I mean as Kay, like they think nature is like balanced. Like people talk about balance in nature like that is ever fucking existed. Nature has been a struggle for three and a half billion years. That's why it is as crazy and weird as it is now because things keep competing for space, for resources, for everything else. If I eat a steak, you can't eat that state. Yeah. And that's a fucking

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       problem for you. Yeah. And again, you know, as we were talking about before this, this balance, it's a natural cycle and it's probably natural that we want to interrupt the balance by bringing back the mammoth. You know that's probably all some natural are weird. Again, I think we should, I think we should totally take control. Like not for the same reason like progressive's too, but I just, I think we should. Scientific reasons and interest reasons like let's just it a cork, let's just make it a cool, cool world. When we're in, we're in control so you know, you start switching out trees, maybe maybe start some genetically modified trees that leak MDM a or something Dunkin at the idea this planet, like an experiment, like the experiment that it is. Dunkin of the idea of engineering a psychedelic virus like a even bola and just like starts forming acid Ebola instead of killing people.

Speaker 1:          02:08:28       Just fucking gives everyone to acid trips. That sounds more damaging than a Zombie apocalypse. Well it would definitely cut back. A lot of the work would be a lot of shit done done. But at this point in time, man, think about all the fucking things that you can buy right now. How many of the things that you can buy, do we actually need or how many of them will be buying just because they're new? I mean if there are things right, the way the world is right now, this very moment today on March, what is it? The 19th March 19th, 2013 the way things are today, if we all agree that no one would innovate and create anything new for one whole year and for that next year we work entirely on getting our shit together. I have beautiful, it would be amazing. Why do they keep putting out cars every year?

Speaker 1:          02:09:17       So many fucking cars. It's pretty good. Yeah. They're super great right now are pretty bad. They really long time and I like new cars. Don't get me wrong. I like the idea of the new technology of like the the innovation. I like the new stereo systems and their navigation. I love all that stuff, but if we only have the cars that we have made already for the next 10 years, we would be fine. We'd totally be fine. But then we never, we never look at a cell phone and go, okay, we're good. We got this, we're good. I was thrilled and I still am to love it. It's still a galaxy two goddamn fucking like seven years. And then that pitch died on me. I was extremely sad because of economic reasons. If you are some multimillionaire, you would have some dope ass crazy phone.

Speaker 1:          02:10:05       Don't you shake your head at me. You son of a bitch. I don't like new stuff too. Would order it on Amazon in the middle of the night. I got my room, I got books and like my laptop tissues. That's what you got a lot of tissues. No Lube Dry Jack. That's like, that's how a man does it. I would say I sound all those Weirdos, lube it up their deck and clean up all that preparing. I don't want to, I don't want to clean it up at all. Mining waste of fucking time. Um, I know you're skeptical, uh, when it comes to why a lot of things that haven't been proven by science, but what do you this subjects from coming up and over and over again, the idea of um, remote viewing. Do you think that's all horse shit? Have you looked into that at all?

Speaker 4:          02:10:47       I, I'm not as much as I suppose I should cause it, it gets in that like if I look at every club fuckery, yeah. I would rather look at things that somebody knows it's true. You know, like, cause that reveals more. But I, I think, I think like the idea of say you being in a room and there's somebody at the doorway and sometimes you notice that, I think that sounds reasonable. You know, that person's disturbing the air. They're making noise. Even if you can't quite hear it. Like they're, they're affecting it. But here's what they should do. If they think remote viewing is a real thing, they, they should try to figure out, like I said earlier, the mechanism for it. Like if you can do remote viewing, can you do it through glass? Can you do it through? It would, can you do it through metal, right. Does it work differently under these circumstances? Why does it work differently in these circumstances? Do the people know each other? Do they not know each other? Did they have like, there are so many questions you could ask and every time you ask a question that you can answer, you refine your understanding of what is actually happening. So they should be doing that

Speaker 1:          02:11:49       [inaudible] I no not right, but maybe they don't want, so it doesn't make any sense. Why would they not want people to know the results? I guess there's no profit in proving that you can remote view.

Speaker 4:          02:12:01       Yeah. And it's not necessarily profit. Like I'm sure there's a lot of people that, that belief in what they're doing, but I think a lot of times they have a, a much lower threshold for evidence then then the scientific community would ask of them. Like, you know, like we did two experiments with some guy sitting in a room and he noticed the guy who was sitting in another room 60% of the time. Like that's slightly peculiar, but there's like there, there's these, the law of rare events, which is like a, a way of statistically analyzing data. And like just by the nature of statistics, you would expect uncommon things to happen. Like somewhat regularly light, like say with like basketball making shots. Like you would expect that sometimes somebody makes 10 shots in a row or with a coin toss, you would expect that sometimes, uh, you would get 10 heads in a row.

Speaker 4:          02:12:53       It would be weird if you didn't like that would be inexplicably, if you never got like 10 heads in a row after you flipped, flipped a coin and say a thousand times or something like that would be the weird thing. So when they do really small tests, like, like say with just a few people you don't know, like if that was an an anomaly, if it was a curiosity, if it was an actual effect, you don't know until you keep getting more and more and more and more data. And then you refine it. The Higgs Boson, they did like billions, hundreds of billions, maybe more uh, experiments hitting, hitting proton beams together to, to get the, to get the energy of the Boson out. How many they do. I think they do like billions a day or something. I can't really remember. They do what? Fucking lot billions of impacts a day.

Speaker 4:          02:13:42       Shit, I don't actually remember but they have over time at least done. Huh? Like hundreds of billions. They do a lot because I mean it's not, it doesn't take a whole lot. Once you've got the whole setup going and you just accelerate them, smash them together, data, all records and then you load up another, another round of Proton beams or whatever it is and you keep doing it over and over and over. And because the Higgs is supposed to be really hard to find B, it was, and it was only supposed to happen. It was a very rare event just by the nature of the quantum mechanics. Like they smash all these things together and sometimes you smashed two protons together and you get these certain types of Bose ons and a Neutrino or sometimes you smash them together and you get a bunch of neutrinos and photon and something else. Like there are different different combinations of things you can get once you create all that, when to get that amount of mass or of, of energy of charge distribution of all these other little quantum effects span and everything else. When you get them in like one little area, you get different things popping out of it. And popping the Higgs bows on out was very rare effect that

Speaker 1:          02:14:45       Boson is one fascinating thing that they discovered. Another fascinating thing was that cork gluon plasma. That's a, that's some intense shit man. What does it like some insane amount of weight, like a sugar cube? Have you dropped it? It would fall straight to the center of the earth. Like it's fucking trillions of tons.

Speaker 4:          02:15:04       Uh, yeah, I, I don't know specifically about it. I mean, so court, okay. So Adam's are made up of electrons on the outside and shells and then protons and neutrons inside protons having a positive charge, neutrons being neutral and a, the protons and neutrons are not fundamental particles. The way the, the electron is, the electron is appoint particle, which I mentioned in a second, but, uh, the proton and the neutron are made up of three quarks, each of different kinds of different configurations of these three quirks and they're just more fundamental particle. And what's keeping them together is the strong force and what the strong and the strong force is mediated by, by a blue ones. In the same way that, like we talked about photons and the electromagnetic field and light is the interaction isn't electromatic magnetic interaction. Photons are, are, are the mediator of electric fields and

Speaker 1:          02:16:01       far down, can they get where they're going to actually still see these things? Like how small does it get before you're just guessing?

Speaker 4:          02:16:10       Hmm. Well, I mean his drink theory is guessing, right? Well, a string theories. Yeah. String theories. Guessing. But, uh, I mean like until then, like that's several orders of magnitude lower than the subatomic particles. Like electrons for now as it is, uh, they seem to be point particles, which means there are zero dimensional there. They don't have a size, they don't have a, a depth, they don't have a surface at all.

Speaker 1:          02:16:36       That shit's ridiculous. I know that's the most, that's the lowest measurable point of reality. And it's up to Voodoo.

Speaker 4:          02:16:44       Yeah. It's, you should think of it as, as an intersection of all the different qualities that makes up and electron like, but it, it, it doesn't have a surface and we, and even if it does have a surface, we can't get close enough to it because of the whole uncertainty principle with him trying to hit it. Like if you want to get really close, like whites got different wavelengths, right? Like radio waves have a wavelength of like meters long and then like you squeeze them together and you get up to microwaves and then up to visible light and then like ultraviolet light and it's just the, uh, higher wavelength gives them a higher energy. So with like a really long wave length, it's like having a really long meter stick. So if you're trying to measure, say like the width of your foot with a yard steak, you're going to get a really inaccurate answer. So you want something smaller. And that's the same thing with measuring position. You want something smaller to measure it and that's a smaller wavelength. But as you do that, you get a much higher energy. So they smash into that fucking electron and then you're not quite sure what the fuck happened there because it hit it. So

Speaker 1:          02:17:45       basically we'll then be able to figure things out better in the future with more accurate measurement.

Speaker 4:          02:17:50       Hopefully. Well, I mean what we, I mean and that's not, not in that way. Like we're never going to be able to, like we can create the whole spectrum of light gamma rays being being the most dense. And if you tried to put more energy into that and to such a small area, you'll start getting like particles. Cause it's too, too much energy. I'm like their light, it'll just turn into a particle.

Speaker 1:          02:18:16       So when they see an electron, like when they can measure an electron, what exactly do they really say?

Speaker 4:          02:18:21       The, the electrical resistance of it to the photon. Wow. Yes. And so, uh, we know now that like virtual particles are popping out of these things all the time. Like they talk about the electric field of the electron, but that field is chunky. It's quantized right it, so it's not smooth and it just doesn't like start dense and like fade out as it goes. It's all these little virtual particles that are go and they go out and then they fall back in.

Speaker 1:          02:18:56       It's until something else hits the average person who's driving in their car right now listening to you talk to understand what the fuck you're even saying. I have no idea where to start. Yeah. It's like that's the hardest part. Like this is your educational background, which trying to dense it or condense it rather to these sort of understandable terms where someone without a great deal of education and it can understand that. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:19:19       Yeah. So, so if you think of any, any electron and it's got this charge and a lot of people kind of know that and deal with static charge and shit like that. So it's got this field emanating from it. And for a while we thought it was just a really smooth field, kind of the way you would imagine like an aura of sorts emanating from this thing. But then with quantum mechanics and then later quantum field theory, we realized that even that is not true. Even that's not smooth. It's made up of this chunky super position of of other particles that kind of behaves like a field until you get really detailed with it. Right. And so it's, it's emanating and reabsorbing all of these little particles all the time. And so when you try to hit it with another particle, you don't know which of these particles, which momentum or anything like that are going to interfere with it. And this is kind of, we're a part of the uncertainty comes from like you don't know when and where these little bits are coming out of the electron and when they're absorbing in or where it's jumping around and all this other shit. So they're, they're just being created and usually they get reabsorbed but if something else gets in there then they, you start hitting back on it and then when that light comes back, that's the surface that we see when we try to measure it.

Speaker 5:          02:20:36       So fucked up that you think is of the nature of reality at its smallest point is that it really is like little crazy magical elves. Yeah, it's kind of a bummer. Why is it a bummer? So it's super embarrassing. Like it could have been much easier, but it's amazing. It is amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing that most things are filled with space, empty space, even hard things or the majority of it is just nothing. Yeah. All this thinking of things is solid is just a really good approximation for things our size. I'm like, that's why we developed that. It's just, I mean, because effectively it is, but it's just an electric field. That tour we're hitting. It's too crazy. Sometimes it makes me tired like this one, just this podcast just made me tired cause I'm like, it's just too much. It's just too nutty. And this is all I think about everyday. All me to that in um, simulation theory simulation. The other thing that's been bounced around in my head all day that's a, that James Gates Shit. Yeah. Superstring the James kept correcting computer code. Yeah. And I certainly don't know enough about string theory

Speaker 4:          02:21:37       or computer code to really comment on it. But I think it's interesting cause it's like, it's not like, like what would be the difference between this universe in a real one? Like would that, would those characteristics exist in a real one? If we were in a fake one? And by the way, I'm, I'm sure we're, we're real

Speaker 5:          02:21:55       and I'm also sure it doesn't really matter. I'm not sure. I don't think it matters. I doesn't matter if it's this good. Hm. Doesn't matter. I mean it is most certainly its own universe. Like unless there was something

Speaker 4:          02:22:06       that could cease it, like I don't see any reason to not. Thank you mean by sees it like in the universal media.

Speaker 5:          02:22:12       Well then why would it have to do that if you've curse while I was working for Google in my leaves might get assimilated into the program. The, the idea that technology is ever increasing, exponentially constant never going change unless there's a natural disaster or nuclear bombs or whatever the fuck happens. If that does happen it will be inevitable. But we have, well first we have to assume that that is actually something that, that somebody could do is create a perfect simulation. I mean we assume so, but we haven't seen anybody say that though. Given all the time in the world it's inevitable without interference. I don't know cause I don't know. It's like I don't, I don't know how to make a universe. I know we, we could assume something but I have not. And also besides that, like you know, Lauren's crafts in the universe from nothing. Yes. Like those universes that just pop out of nothing seems like they would probably be way more common than created universes because there's a lot of space for an entire new universe to grow in. But ultimately it doesn't even matter whether it's more common as long as it happens once you, as long as one species that's super intelligent and keeps going on and on without interruption. But natural disaster for the next hundred thousand years and computer power exponentially increases to the point where video games become virtual reality versions. Like, like for all we know,

Speaker 5:          02:23:35       I mean this universe is extremely large. Took a lot of energy. It's infinite. Yeah. It's like, and fractal meaning infinite universes. Wow. Well,

Speaker 3:          02:23:48       okay.

Speaker 5:          02:23:48       I, I don't think we really, we really know that about fracking. I mean, they're fractal. All the natural fractals are limited to a certain number of scales, like the random fractals, like the mantle, but mental broad set and the Julia sets and stuff like that. Those are infinite. But we've never seen an infinite fractal in nature. We see stuff like ferns, which makes sense on the leaf. The branch. Yeah. Yeah. We, we, we see it in certain places, but there's always a top and a bottom to it. I get it never goes. It's never infinite scales. Right. It, so, but the idea of the universe being fractal, isn't it? That the black holes are gateways to another universe. Each black hole contains hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with a black hole inside of them with hundreds of billions of galaxies inside of it. And since that may not be necessarily infinite but in measurable. Gotcha. Well, I mean, black holes do have a finite energy, right? They do it, it, it, it defines their, their side, maybe 1% of the mass of the galaxy that exists. Yeah. Super massive black holes. So, so it is defined. So maybe like if there's other universes inside a black hole, like

Speaker 5:          02:25:04       the universe itself inside the black home may be defined by the size of the black hole. Yeah. But it's like we have all these black holes in our universe, right? So if our universe was inside a black hole, it would have to contain all the energy of all those black holes also, unless it's just popped out of nothing. And then

Speaker 4:          02:25:23       if it's popping out of nothing, then we don't need to be inside a black hole. We don't need to be inside. Anything inside may be a completely arbitrary concept. Yeah, it may be. Yeah, it's a part of like these are doorways and I mean like, like the whole other things that indicate that maybe our universes is just generated out of nothing is the fact that if you take all the energy and there's, there's positive energy of all the stuff and there's negative energy from, from relationships between gravitation and like the location of things. If you add it all up, it seems to add up to zero, which is say that our universe has a net total energy content of zero, which is kind of what you would expect for something that came from nothing. Nothing at all. Rather than, than being generated by a computer program or anything like that.

Speaker 1:          02:26:12       The wackiest theory of the world has ever known. Forget about Jesus and Moses and Thor. How about the fact that the fucking scientific community, the communities, number one theory on the creation of the universe is the Big Bang theory? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:26:26       yeah, yeah. It, I mean, but it's, it's where all the evidence pointed. Yeah. Like that's the thing, like we couldn't make it up. It's just seems to be like, it's not, it's not scientist fault.

Speaker 1:          02:26:36       That's so insane. The idea that the universe was smaller than literally the head of a pin. The entire universe, infinitely dense, smaller the head of a pin and go. Yeah. I mean technically we're still pretty uncertain about that first, like second or two, right. Most of the universe we, we understand pretty well up until you get to like that first second. But isn't it funny that people like, Oh, you really believe Jesus came back from the dead? That so unlikely. Well, is it, is it any more unlikely than the whole fucking universe existing out of a tiny things smaller than the head of a pin, which explodes for no apparent reason. No University?

Speaker 4:          02:27:22       Well, we know at least one universe exists. We don't know at least one person that's come back from the dead. That's true. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:27:28       You gotta go where the evidence hasn't come right from the dead and we know the billions of people have lived and died and none of them have told us about her plan like, well, you don't know, man. I saw this Morgan back from the dead and then he took his body to heaven. He took the evidence to have an like an ass Holsten you people are not ready for him yet. We've got to wait till we get our shit together and they'll come back. Great. If like God didn't realize that people were too dumb to get the message. 2000 years ago, he was like, oh my God. These people are fucking idiots. They've been worshiping cows for while. I think if God really wanted us to get the message, she would probably tell us all the time back when people didn't have phones. Yeah, it's either that or he's a gigantic Dick is going to punish you for all of eternity based on some hearsay you're going to get from people who fuck kids. If there's self-aware organisms in the universe and you made the and you give a shit about anything they do. Yeah. Just bring it up. Yeah. Don't leave them with a book that's been translated three different times and three of them different fucking languages that are thousands of years old. Microsoft updates like every four years. If God really was that guy like, man, what? How bad would that suck if we really were under the the complete power of some

Speaker 5:          02:28:43       Dick of 3000 years ago I came down, I gave you a Zombie. He came back to life. You don't pay attention. Fuck you. Fuck you. Then burn in hell. What about the baby's awesome? He has a very, very low criteria.

Speaker 1:          02:29:00       Maybe he has done, you don't even know. The most mind blowing thing that I ever heard when in relationship or in that relates to the size of the universe was on that. Even watch that Morgan Freeman show through the, through the worm hole or whatever it is, really shit. They had these scientists that were trying to explain infinite. They're trying to explain the the infinite nature of the universe. And he said that infinite is so big and this is so hard to understand. But what infinite means is that not only is there an exact version of earth somewhere but the exact series of events exactly as they've happened here, happened there like there are so many earths that would be so many environments that are exactly like ours because you're dealing literally with something that has no end. So in the insanely vast distance of forever literally. And we could still say that there are certain things that wouldn't be like there wouldn't be yes and maybe no, maybe everything would happen exactly as it did on this in this earth. But right next door there's a fucking earth, you know a couple of trillion light years away that everything happened up until a certain point. And then you got ahold of some Parkinson's disease medication that turned you into a gay sex and gambling addicts and your life went off the fucking rails.

Speaker 5:          02:30:28       Things like that. But like, there wouldn't be a universe where you and I are having this conversation except Brian is a pink hippo like mine because the laws of the universe that made us don't include pink hippos. Hippo produced can talk, he's all bummed out. He wanted to be a pink hippo is pink hippo. That's why they wanted to be a dolphin. A dolphin. Oh, you want to be in a dolphin? But no, uh, uh, there was this conversation on, on the board recently where I brought up the thing about, uh, if you had a thousand monkeys on typewriters, eventually they would write the works of Shakespeare given an infinite number of time or amount of time. I think that's horse shit. But it is true because an infant in a number of time. Yeah, because if you had like it, let's just take out the monkeys and say, you have one computer program.

Speaker 5:          02:31:19       You imagine that a monkey really did, right? Like Romeo and Juliet. You just left this monkey in a fucking room of the Thai baht. And most of it was dog shit. Most of them just a Dcsi. Why, why? But one day that monkey just got it right and his little fucking eyes rolled in the back of his head like a slot machine and he starts typing. It just can't even right at the end of midsummer night's dream car about Romeo. I mean, the question is, you know, like say you're randomly selecting characters, like each character is randomly selected and you do this for an infinite string of characters, then not only would you get, uh, the entire works of Shakespeare, but you would get an infinite number of times. You would get it backwards an infinite number of times. You would get every chapter in every order, an infinite number of times you would get everything that's ever been written and every single order that you could ever think to put it in an infinite number of times by much sweat, infinite.

Speaker 5:          02:32:16       That monkeys, well, he's on a typewriter. I would use chimps, but yeah, they're, they wouldn't hurt their little fingers. Monkeys, they're little tiny hands. Yeah, man, that's the word. Yeah. Even that it doesn't even begin to describe it and that that word is a real problem word. We don't, we really, that doesn't register with me. When I say infinite, I might just like space. It's like until I can think about it and then it keeps going. I mean even just like when you see those videos of like they send a probe, like an artificial probe like to show you what it looks like when they leave earth and then it sees the moon and it sees the other outer planets and then it sees, you know, the, the galaxy from a distance. Then it keeps going and going. That doesn't work. It doesn't get in there.

Speaker 5:          02:33:02       It doesn't get in there. I mean that they're, they're so fucking far away when you have to start thinking about the speed of light, like the fact that the sun is like eight light minutes away. Maurice is like 30 light minutes away. Pluto is like 18 hours away in terms of lights. We'll, Dr Greer's going to let us know, goodness, how big the universe is when reveals what the aliens have been telling him and uh, which you would think he would know so much that he actually, he meditated and contacted them. That's the way to do it. You know, you really should have asked him some of their new science. Like surely they know some things that scientists don't. That would really help us long. Well they know how to come here. Well they're really good us. We knew how to go there. Do you really want to go there though dude? Cause what if you get stuck? I don't know. Maybe that's why they're here. Cause it fucking sucks. Could be they don't have gazelles or anything there. Yeah, they probably just all of them, they've, they've bred themselves to the point with a uniform that either they're all just great things with a big fucking stupid heads. No muscles. Do you ever say years ago they had a, that thing about if you distorted a person's face and the way that a baby's fit, what happened to

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       it?

Speaker 1:          02:34:19       Because you use in a fucking shitty Samsung device instead of a God damn apple iPad.

Speaker 4:          02:34:24       No, I'm using the iPad but the, the uh, uh, the way the babies visual system, it's like inaccurate. Like it's weak in various areas. And if you do that to an image of a person, you get something like it kind of bends outward. So it kind of seems like they have a larger head, their eyes get much bigger because they're very prominent in that part of the brain that recognizes faces. Hmm. And A and it gets a little colorless and they kind of look like aliens. That was an assumption. That was years ago. I Dunno if they follow it up.

Speaker 1:          02:34:53       Well that's interesting. So the images that we have from our early childhood might sort of be the archetype.

Speaker 4:          02:35:01       Some reason for angels and aliens and Demons and all these other make believe things that people keep thinking they're interacting with throughout history. Like there's, there's some sort of reason for that. What do you think it is neurologically?

Speaker 1:          02:35:15       Do you think it also the extrapolation, like the idea that you're, your body knows where it's going and that that's the future. Like if we look at chimps, lower primates, whatever it is, and then we look at human beings and following the trend. If you look at that, that is the trend. I mean we are the the ape man. Maybe you know,

Speaker 4:          02:35:33       it's the trend. Like we're, I think, I think that would be great if we start going in space and we lose all our muscle mass in our, in our hair and our guys are dicks to dude. They have no decks. Dude. Imagine the processing power of their internal pornography.

Speaker 1:          02:35:49       Yeah. I think it just touch you on your nose and you'd come in your pants but you wouldn't even have pants. God, that's the best x man ever. Who would make you come with rob banks just to make sure that x man showed up? Yeah. If you look at a gorilla and you look at a person and you look at an alien, we're closer to the alien yard from, from man. We aren't we closer to the look of an a gray alien than we are to a gorilla. Pretty seamless. Others that shaved or that hairless hairless chimp that looked quite a bit like a person. Yeah. Yeah. That thing would work. Brock Lesnar

Speaker 4:          02:36:25       [inaudible] if you took away the sword Tattoo. Yeah. Those. Look, why didn't, I would love to see that chimp with tattoos. Even just like fake tattoos. Yeah, tribal dollies. Barbed wire and shit. How scary would it be if you had a Mike Tyson Tattoo on his face shape? What those Mike Tyson tribals. That'd be terrible. Oh, I'm scare the fuck out of it. Wasn't there a story about Mike Tyson went and fight attempt? I'm sure he probably back in early, early years, he was like offering like 10,000 the only way it would work as if they, they closed the mouth of the champ and they didn't teach them how to fight. Fuck that. All you'd have to do is the chimp. All we'd have to do is get ahold of you though. The thing is get ahold of me. Anybody? I don't know about Mike, I don't know Tyson, but can they take a punch like I know they can take some abuse, but has it, has any, has any chimp just like really fucking right hooked and other champion

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       that job, do they have that button that just puts them out? What's a good question. And also the, the, the size of their head and bone structure and everything, that kind of damage that Tyson can do, like as they're closing the distance on you. If Tyson on corks with like a right left combination palm home straight, right ham, power left hook behind it, boom. Right to the chimps dome. Can a chimp take it? I wonder if there's a little really good. That is why we need science. Yeah. Needing it to answer that. Quite take a chimp and lets them do tee off on a chimp. Just say let Leo a chimp. Well that's the only way to do, unless you want to sacrifice the man. I don't think anybody's gonna allow you to let a champ lose to fuck. Cause the first thing that chimps going to do is, but I don't think anybody's gonna allow you to tie up at champion, punch it in the fucking face.

Speaker 1:          02:38:01       I would think that would happen. It would be more likely to happen than to have a cage fight with a chimp or a boxing match with a chimp Southeast Asian country. It probably already did it. Well, I think they did that with the rang of tanks in boxing. But they don't really rip things right? No. When they give him gloves and then about monkeys are kind of person. He's like, yeah, they're not biters like humans. I was like, God, chimpanzees or humans for that matter, chimpanzees are rude. They just go right for your tech. Rip that off. Rip Your feet off, bite your fingers off. Novas are so nice. And we're as related to each of them equally. But nobos the, they can't even have Benobos in a fucking zoo cause it just start with the hanging can't have them cause they just start fucking, they fuck everywhere and jerk off in front of everybody.

Speaker 1:          02:38:47       I do think it's a good reminder though, like when people bring up how violent chimps are and they're like, you know, there our closest cousin like, so where'd that violent? We're also close to the, to the do nothing but fuck all day. Yeah. What happened? How'd that it's like, it's almost like they're their bolt. They both represent the closest living primate to us and yet they both represent the total opposites of the spectrums of human behavior and almost that particular circumstance. I'm sure they have, you know, similar social structure fight and Alpha males do. Right. Elphaba aren't they matriarchal though? No. Goes. Yeah. I think the uh, the females are a charge. That might be the issue too. That comes up a lot. Yeah, I think that would definitely help. I mean, surprise the ones that give birth run show, well the only other matriarchal society that I know of in the animal kingdom is hyenas.

Speaker 1:          02:39:39       Lions too, right? No, no, no, no, no. I thought the mail was a bitch. He likes, stayed home and took care of the guilty, takes care of everything. The males are enormous, but it doesn't kill, well he does occasionally, but mostly kills like predators and hyenas and shit like that. But the males, the king of the jungle and he's the biggest motherfucker. He's the baddest, he protects the other lions from encroaching mails and things along those lines. But Hyenas are actually matriarchal in that the female is larger than the male. And actually has a foe penis. She dominates the mail. She gets on top of them and fucks him with her fake. She pegged him.

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       Yeah. It's huge. If you're seeing it, hold on, I haven't seen puts your boner female. Yeah, it's like a pussy boner. But it's bigger than a real

Speaker 1:          02:40:22       Boehner. I mean, it's enormous. It's like an arm may female, Hyena, penis, hyenas. Huge. It's shoe. It's bigger than the males like this. Yeah. Yeah. It's a bigger than the males. Awesome. What? She's bigger. And the reason why is because the life of a heinous, so ruthless, the female has to be large to keep the males from eating the babies. So the females have to run things cause the hyenas just live in the most nasty world possible. Everything is just stealing meat and biting things and then snapping bones, running away with chunks of carpets, your predators and even killing them. Have you ever seen that video where a bunch of Hyenas Corner, uh, hurt female lion? It's fucked up. There's a, there's a cool documentary on hyenas and lions and it was all about how there's a constant struggle between the hyenas and lions and hyenas. Well, like circle eight. Look at that. Look at that fake penis. Look at that thing. That's a fake female penis and it's enormous

Speaker 5:          02:41:26       little turd shooting in Andover. See what it gets hard. That debit is just walking. I guess it doesn't come out of Harvard Tiger, right? It's just like dangling off. It's just like a horn. It's not like [inaudible] or something like a what? Cloe Aka the holes that birds have and I think some fishing and never heard of that. It's like they have internal genitalia. Oh, I see what you're saying. And that's the little hole like crocodiles that when they sex the crocodile, they have to stick their finger in their cloaca. I don't know if they call it a Clo Waco with it. That's how they milk them. Well, that's how they figure out if there's like what's in those sex sexual orientation. Yeah. That's fascinating man. It's a god. What's my, to just look up her up looking at China. China's female. Oh, same as down. Don't put that.

Speaker 5:          02:42:11       Is that bigger than that? He knows. It's about the same behind. It's aggressive. I think that's a good way to end the show. It's like a hitchhiker stumps.

And then somebody told me that you can just put a wrap on your car and then when you sell it, if you, you could just peel it off. It's called murdering it. You put a matte black color, all that car, all you're murdering, if anyone knows how to do it or
