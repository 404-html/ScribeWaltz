Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Court.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Is that it? Yeah. Hello, we're back. We're back folks. You know, we, we ended on a very important point and we ended on a point so important that we had to bring it back up again.

Speaker 1:          00:00:19       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       The lack of manliness in this fucking country, ladies and gentlemen, it's me and here's his salt. Here's something for you man. And this is, you look at cinema today. Cinemas, a big thing in the United States. It always has been. It sets trends. It sets, you know, kind of people's morals to a certain extent. So let me read you this. Let me read you this IDP. I was, how do you say that database? Yes. That Guy Idb oh, this man. And he's one of my favorite dudes ever. But I'm going to read you this list of films he was involved with either as a screenwriter or a writer. Okay. Which as a screenwriter and a rider is a guy who comes up with the idea of the fucking movie. So that's pretty important. It's huge. So here we go. Here's a list of movies for you. Dirty Harry, Jeremiah Johnson.

Speaker 2:          00:01:08       Well, the life and times of Judge Roy Bean tease Paul Newman, magnum force apocalypse now, Jesus, 1941 comedy with John Belushi, Conan the barbarian, the first one, original 1982, the one that made Arnold Schwarzenegger is star and Future Governor of California Cohen on what is best in life. I still enemies to the living before you and hear the lamination. Uh, uh, and I, and to me personally, this is, I'm a child of the 80s, so this is like my movie, my goto thing. Red Dawn, he wrote the screenplay for right. First of all, how dare you, how dare he both of you go fuck yourself. That movie's terrible. Fuck, I'm not drive in a 78 Firebird any more hoodies and I'm not living in that time frame. Would that right back off man? Red Dawn, the shit, the shit. What's Red Dragon Wolverines, mother, whatever it is. You said red dragons. That's it man.

Speaker 2:          00:02:17       That's like, that's one like overeating. It makes me sad that you don't know that it's a good movie or as good as roadhouse doe. Clear and present danger. Uh, Laurie yet Rome, the TV series, 22 episodes. I was a legit TV. Do you ever watch that? Rome. What year was that? Uh, 2005 HBO series. Wow. I don't think I did. It was a legit, um, that's a must be post gladiator. They decided to do that and yeah, probably. Yeah. That, that thing. Patrick Swayze. Yes. Right there, baby. That's the, that's the original legit red dawn. Is that the trailer? Yeah. Peter tried to tell me Span Johnson. Ben Johnson was a mother fucking gangster. Swayze died from cigarettes. They tried to say that. Did he? I, I watched the last, uh, on Netflix and says, Shit. The beast, the last series that he did, yes. And it was pretty good, but God damn, he looked bad.

Speaker 2:          00:03:16       It looked terrible. I mean, it was like, you felt so bad cause roadhouse was a legit movie. Religious hard to fuck with that. Awesome. We terrible. Hey, it's hard to fuck with that. It's got, Patrick Swayze is a Boucher with Sam Elliott as his mentor. And Ben, who's Ben Vareen is, yes, the bad guy. The bad guy. I own, but I don't care. Whoever the chick was with the giant jugs. Oh, she's so pretty. Yeah, she was. She's just fucking smart too. I'm sure she didn't take care of you. She was a doctor. She was huge. Stitch you up, send you back out into the battlefield. Basically. The perfect woman accepts you as you go. It looks like a rubber blowup doll. It's been left out in the sun for 20 years. You could take a picture of her right now. I don't want to take a picture of it and I want to go back in time back in 19 I don't want to smell her vagina when it smelled like paradise wrote about.

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       Uh, well, I don't want to bring that up. We don't want to get, you don't want to stir up too much shit, but I was going to say at that point in time, that was like the Steven Seagal era. That's when Steven Seagal like roadhouse was that Steven Seagal was like right about there because Steven Seagal started with above the law. That was legit. That was like 90 91 right around that era. 89 maybe that's when roadhouse was roadhouse was 89 and it was awesome and it's still awesome. Oh, it's got some of the best lines ever until it's time to not be nice. Yeah. How do we know when that is? I'll let you know. Pain don't hurt.

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       Oh, that's, that was great stuff, dude. He looks at say, well Sam, it's been a gangster forever, but actually above the law cane before roadhouse. It was a eight, eight, four 88. That was just first movie. Like he's doing Kung Fu and he was hanging out with that dude who was, uh, Jeff. Uh, the guy was, the guy was blind and grape scenarios. Yes. Great Blues Guy. Yeah. Kelly Lynch. That's her name. Right. So pretty. You're so fucking hot. I don't even want to know what she looks like now. She will forever look like she looked at in my eyes. Oh, this, that's the monster truck days. Got Girls got entirely too many brains to have an ass like that. No, it's fine. That's fine. That's a quote from Sam Elliott. It's ridiculous. Sam Elliott was incorrect. It's just a matter of being able to handle it. Look at the little chicken chest.

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       I'm Patrick Swayze. He's so lucky. There's no black man in that movie. So lucky because there was a black man that got injured. They did. They did the fucked up graphic. That was the, they didn't have the original graphic. Oh Wow. That's probably a post that was failing three. I bet that was an early trailer Mip, but did they have a lot of trailers back then? Yeah, the early, if you look at trailers, like a lot of like big films, they were all dog shit. Now with the trailer is better than the fucking movie that I have a real problem or trailers. Now I wait for a bus on the movie and I try not to see the trailer. If I could see a trail on my computer, I'll literally turn away, but I heard the Godzilla trailer was nothing. It was just like there was a, someone said it was amazing trailer and it's actually a like a proof of concept. It's a concept. Okay. It's not that they just started filming in recently on a Wahoo. According to Twitter. Have you seen a move on source? I'm trying to think about, I haven't seen movie. The last movie that really made me like, you know what, like that's a bad ass. Like that's a one for the ages. I'm trying to think of it. And the closest I can come is it departed.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       The department was really good, but Avatar does it for me. Really. I hadn't dealt with stupid. I know it was dumb. I know. It requires suspension. It's a bunch of hippy bullshit. It's nothing more than one. It's, it's a, it's like a bunch of fucking, uh, it's revisionist American Indian history. You're right. You're right. You're right. If it was an original thought, you got me. I respect the technical aspects of the filmmaking cause it's fucking amazing what they did. But the story is straight up. Fucking put truly bull. You can follow up with Julie. You're totally right. You're totally right. However, I feel it's my feeling that, um, a movie like that is a comic book movie and it's basically a vehicle for just showing you pretty things and getting you carried away in a story. And, uh, I, I see your argument, but I also see the argument and making it completely.

Speaker 2:          00:07:47       James Cameron is a fucking genius. He's a wicked motherfucker. He's a fucking genius dude. Went down to the farthest reaches of the ocean south. Yes, Matt. I mean south, I think he's a stud and I, and I respect what he does and I wish more people had the balls and ability to do what he does. I think you, you've got to have a giant fucking ego to do what he does. But you know what? You get that ego by making movies that make hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. That's so true. You know, I was talking to um, uh, people on my message board about, uh, there was, someone was talking about, there's a, a situation recently where there was a, a, a billionaire, a very famous cat who denounce Steve Jobs and sold all his apple stock. His name is Jay Robertson. He dumped all his apple shares. And the reason why I did, he said Steve Jobs is a really awful person. Like that's his quote. And there was like this big debate on my message board and, and you know, I started reading it and you know what, what makes the guy an awful person and what doesn't? And My, my take on it was that it's like anybody running a company like that where you're running like

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       an insanely innovative pressure filled company that's trying to be at the very, the very front of the line of the most competitive form of technology available consumer technology in the phone business should, I mean they, they're, they're, they're so like attached to people's like that mean people fight over android versus apple or you know, I'm, I've got a windows phone, I'm a fucking contrarian and it's a weird, very competitive Uber Geek Environment. And Steve Jobs was the master of that Shit. The phones master of the home computer. He was the master. He made exclusivity. He made the, he, he came up with the very best stuff. And for him it was like, it was everything. It was his whole existence. And for the people that work for him, it was a job man. Just like you talking about working at the auto [inaudible] I'm working for, for, yeah, it's just a job. If you had to work for Steve Jobs, you would have fucking nightmare stories about that con. Yeah. He'd be like, that guy's a douche bag.

Speaker 4:          00:09:57       It goes. That's one of the things about, another thing I'm fascinated by is with modern media, new media, um, Facebook, Twitter, everything, just the way everything is. It's this thing that if you don't agree 100% with what an entity as a company does or with, if you think a person is an asshole, then all of a sudden that means whatever they make, whatever they do is not cool or not acceptable anymore. And to me that's false.

Speaker 3:          00:10:30       I see. It's positive. I see a, it represents this unique need for accountability across the board.

Speaker 4:          00:10:38       I understand accountability, but here's the thing, man. If, if you're in charge of getting something done, I don't give a fuck who you are. If you're in charge of making something and putting product out the door, somewhere along the line someone's going to say, you're a fucking asshole. Sounds going to get butthurt. Yeah. It's impossible not to that true. So that's true. But I show now and it's the fact that, okay, and I'm, maybe I'm guilty of it in certain instances, but at the same time it's like, why not let the person's work speak for themselves, you know? I mean, okay, perfect example music. Uh, I try not to get, I, I'm guilty of this. I try not to get worked up because I'm a conservative, pretty much. Dude. You know, if any, like I said, I feel like, and this is a problem that I run into with most left leaning or whatever you want to call it, is I'm perfectly willing to let anybody do whatever the fuck they want. The flip side of that is, let me do what the fuck I want. Right. And that you be a man. Yeah. And that's the problem that most people fucking run into say, no, no, no, no. You'd have to fall within these parameters. How dare you want to do x, Y, z. You can't do that. We need to control this. Yeah. So my point

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       is if any of these guys, you know, I don't give a fuck if you're a prick. I don't care if you're an asshole. I don't care if you got in a fight with the guy over here or are you getting a lawsuit over some bullshit if your product does what it says it will you treat me right as a customer? Why am, why would I ever be an asshole and not buy your shit because someone else says they don't like you. Well, I think it's based on empirical evidence and what, what, what, what, what? Now, that's not to say if a guy's a legitimate fucking prick. Look, I've heard conversations that other people have had about me. Right? Someone has said that I was a head. I was like, Oh man, let me tell you what that guy actually did. I walked in and said this to my friend, like right away, Zack, of course I was a dick to him, right?

Speaker 2:          00:12:45       He's got me the creepy eyes, you know? He's saying that, I think I'm too good. Whatever the fuck it is, there's two sides to the story. Exactly. And that's the problem with the way shit is now, is that all of a sudden through an onslaught. Now imagine if you're just a fucking guy, just a dude that doesn't have a big media presence and somebody decides to, you know, you, you, you run into some asshole out here and they go, hey, look, you know, for whatever reason, something goes down and all of a sudden they want to make you the asshole. Now that's, I mean, is it right? Is it wrong? Not so much. Well, they're trying to reshape reality and they're trying to influence other people's opinions to justify their own opinion. Not only that, but there is a fucking mob mentality of let's jump on board and you know, we're going to fuck this guy.

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       And I know for a fact you've been a victim of it. Me. Yeah, absolutely. Perfect example. I mean, you're outspoken on certain shit. Perfect example was with the, uh, uh, the, the, the transsexual thing. I mean you got your fucking nuts kicked in and certain circles over that it's happened before. I mean, so that was, it was all important. You know, that was a, that was a good thing. That was a, that was important for dialogue. Yeah. Like it's important for those people to express themselves and be angry at me. You can't hurt my feelings. That's all right. I understand. If you have a version of reality to difference, and here's when it comes to describing, here's what tilt me is when people want to start fucking with your income. Yeah. People start going, they don't go to you what they want to be reacted to know.

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       They want to go, hey look, you know, fuck this. We're boycotting the UFC. You know, they're calling your boss, or not your boss, but your employer, Dana white saying, hey look, you know, you need to fire this guy because he's a fucking asshole. And, and to me that's just like, you know, that's the biggest pussy move on the planet because they can't argue what you were saying, that they're not willing to have a dialogue and say, I disagree with you because of this. Let me try it. Let me try to swing you to my way of working. They want to say no, I disagree with what you're saying. I'm a pussy, so fuck you. I'm going to try and take your money. Not only that, there's also something

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       that's going on with people that disagree with certain people's opinions is that they are absolutely convinced that they are right and that you are wrong. So because of that, they're willing to do almost anything to express the idea that you are wrong, whether it's distort reality, whether it's to give their opinion a very biased way, excluding certain aspects of the facts, whatever it is, there's an ego battle along with the ideology battle. My problem is when that ego battle is so glaringly obvious and you're not willing to admit that that's exactly what the fuck is going on. You know, like we said about the transsexual thing, like I'm happy to get the transactional conversation out there because I think ultimately once the dust settles, I think people should realize that it doesn't matter. You know, it doesn't matter if someone wants to be a woman or if someone wants to be a man or if you want to live your life doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What matters is how do you treat people

Speaker 4:          00:15:47       well at the same time, this is kind of been my issue with, uh, I dunno, alternative lifestyles, whatever the hell you want to call it. But it's, there's a difference between acceptance and it's like, okay, here, look, I accept the way someone wants to live their life. No problem. That's on you, but don't expect me to cheerlead you. Well, you know what I think that's from, you know, don't expect me to be. It's like, you know, I will accept however you want to live your life, but accept the fact that it's possible. There are people out there that are willing to accept it and say you're, you're, you're, you know, that's, you're right. 100% but that doesn't mean they have to agree with it. And if they don't agree with it, it doesn't make them a bigot.

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       Right? Well, people don't have to agree with anything, you know, as long as you treat people fairly and kindly and it doesn't matter.

Speaker 4:          00:16:39       That's what I really look for. And to me that's a sign of someone that I will respect is someone that is willing to understand and they can argue vigorously. You know, that I do not agree with what you're saying, but, but I respect your right and your ability to live the way you want to live. And I will not degrade you and I will not hinder you, but I do not agree with you.

Speaker 3:          00:17:06       Yeah. I think it's a really important point to know that there's a bunch of different ways of looking at the world and you might not agree with my way of looking at the world. It doesn't mean that you're right, that doesn't mean that you're wrong either. It means a, your, the, the, the fucking, the spectrum of thinking is so broad. There's a lot of variabilities. What's important, I think as a culture and as a community that anything that we agreed to, we agreed to on the basis. Does it cause less harm than it does? You know, does it co, does it cause more good than it does harm? Right. And as long as we act in that way, we would let allow anything. Right. Basically, as long as it doesn't victimize people,

Speaker 4:          00:17:44       man, that's the way I look at it is, is I mean I could write up a bill rights and it would be about

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       eight sentences and it would be maybe not even that. Basically it's your rights end where mine begin. You don't get to touch children and you know, that's it. I mean basically just do whatever the hell you want to do, man. Let your freak flag fly. But at the end of the day, you know what? You've got to pay your taxes. You got to go to work. Let your fleet, your freak flag fly. Yeah. Jimi Hendrix baby. That's it. That's his line. You know, I mean, do whatever you gotta do. I don't give a shit. But at the end of the day, you're still a member of a community. So most important thing to say ever, and I fucked it up. Let your freak flag fly. Yeah, let it free party 2014 starting a new political party. I saw that. I'm down with that. It's a hunter.S Thompson had freak power and the 1970s I'm going what?

Speaker 2:          00:18:42       The Freak Party for 2013 out of respect for HST. You know what's funny is in other countries with parliamentary systems, um, it's designed towards not a two party deal. Well, my point is you can do, I mean no party and now the countries, I mean you could legitimately no bullshit. Probably put together a freak party and maybe get one or two house, you know, house members and they would have, you know, but I mean that's, that's what's crazy. I think the way the system was designed, that was what was in mind. It was never designed to be two parties. No, they hijack that. Yeah. And I think that I could be president of Canada. If you're willing to move to Vancouver, we can make some shit happen. I mean, Edmonton and I can't tell you for, I mean that's, I love Canada. You know what I love about Canadians?

Speaker 2:          00:19:31       They're the nicest people in the world. So Nice. They have beautiful women, so hot, but fuck, they're communist. They're communists. Listen, only when it comes to healthcare, the only his communist is the people that you interact with. If you choose to interact with the people that are all social Isti and they're trying to fucking make it the NERF, the world and provide [inaudible]. I got two topics for us. Number one. Tell me what the fuck you would have done in New York City if it would have been your wife and your two kids and an SUV and that SUV thing. Here's my take on that and I'm sure you've talked about before, but I haven't really, it's the SUV, um, motorcycle biker thing. I don't know how that guy was driving. I don't know what happened. I don't know if anyone was aggressive. I don't know if anyone was clueless. I literally don't know what I looked at when I saw the end where that guy drove over those people and uh, drove over those bikes. I saw a guy who looked like he was panicking and it looked like he was surrounded. But without the information of hearing what these guys were saying to him or what had happened before that I don't, you know, I saw the one guy slow down. It's like brake check them, brake

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       checked him and, but apparently something had occurred before that where the guy had like maybe bumped into a bike or gotten too close to a bike, but apparently something had occurred before that where they were involved in all [inaudible] with another automobile. And there's a video of that and there's a mob mentality sort of an argument to be taken to I think unless you're there. And you know, there was like three cops, they're undercover. I think it was five, six x six is the last I heard was three in and they arrested one. Well, you know, cops are people. There's a problem for sure. Um, I don't know what the fuck happened, man. I really don't know who got beat up. New Video, the new video shows a guy got beat up apparently. I don't know who caused what. I Dunno who deserve what. I do know that I've been around some dudes and bikes and act like fucking cock suckers, but I've do know that I've been around people in cars around bikes and act like fucking cock suckers. I do know that people tend to act like fucking cock suckers when they're in groups especially. Yeah, and I don't know if it's the guy in the truck didn't know what the fuck he was doing or the gun. The bike didn't. I don't know what happened, man.

Speaker 4:          00:21:56       I mean, I dunno. I fedec. From what I've watched and from what I've seen, one of the best forum posts I've seen yet that described it was I seriously doubt that that guy in the SUV woke up that morning, put his wife and kid in the truck and said, let's go fuck with some bikers. But I'm willing to bet at least a few of those fucking bikers woke up in the morning, got on their motorcycle and said, let's go fuck with some of these guys.

Speaker 3:          00:22:23       Maybe. And it might be, they're just, they all got together and felt the power in numbers. That's fine.

Speaker 4:          00:22:28       The same time, you know, the brake check thing, I mean, I've read different accounts and I've seen some different videos and then you look at history. Past performance is an indicator. It really is. You know what people do in the past, but to me it just looks like, I don't know. The biggest thing that flipped my mind, those motherfuckers chased him like 50 blocks in Manhattan. Yeah. You've been in New York? Yeah. How the fuck do you do 2030 more recycles 40 motorcycles chasing a guy through Manhattan. What a fucking cops.

Speaker 3:          00:23:05       Yeah. Where are the cops were to cops? I don't know. I mean, I don't know if he called the cops. I don't know if he had a flat. I think you might have had a flat tire to that.

Speaker 4:          00:23:12       I don't give a fuck 50 blocks a minute. You can't drive 50 blocks in van. You can't. I mean for fuck sake.

Speaker 3:          00:23:18       Well, you know who knows what? What's going to come out about the undercover cops? How much information? My question is if one of those guys were calling them off. Yeah, it could be. I mean, could be, is that possible? I don't know. You know, like I said, both sides are gross. It's gross. If the guy was disrespecting the motorcycles or it's gross. If the guy was panicking and putting people in jeopardy. It's also growing. But here's the thing. Here's the way I look at the guys stopped the guy brake

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       checks them. If you just started that video, dude, brake checks them. Number one, if you're on a motorcycle and you brake, check an SUV, you're a fucking moron cause you're gonna lose. Yeah, that sounded good. That's number one. You're a dick. Even if you're 100% right, even if this guy almost ran you off the fucking road, okay, you got me, you're on the right. But if you can in front of them and brake, check them and he runs you the fuck over. Whose fault is that? Even if you were right to be mad. So right there, one wrong. And so the guy gets on the brakes and then the next thing he stopped and he's surrounded by these bikes. Now if you're a guy, and, and he was the thing, it goes back to what we started about before. The whole thing about fucking people not being a man. You know, here's this guy, probably never been in a fight in his fucking life. You know, never had to protect himself, never had to protect his family and he's surrounded by these fucking assholes. So what's he do?

Speaker 3:          00:24:48       Panic. Exactly. Yes. Right. Yeah. Well it's a scary fucking scenario, man. If it would have been

Speaker 4:          00:24:57       me and that position and I was, well I dunno, all I gotta say is it would have been like, I dunno,

Speaker 3:          00:25:04       you see death race 2000 like microfilm or like every which way, but loose the remake. I have been around both. I've been around very respectful bikers who do, they ride down the road like you know, a hundred strong and you know, waving to people and share and there's no problems. And I've also seen assholes. I've seen assholes cut people off and get in front of people. And there's a, there's a thing when you have ultimate strength, when most of your life you don't have ultimate strength most of your life. You have a shitty job. We have to respond to your boss, right? You have a bunch of rules you have to live by. And then all of a sudden you're in this fucking scenario. There's the guy tears the cop. The guy on the right is a cow. Wow. The guy who did that, I ran the duty,

Speaker 4:          00:25:44       the bike with the, either that or he, one of them because at least in the newspaper I saw the dude had the cut right there. That a guy with the cut on with the three three piece patch. Yeah. He's a cop. Why did he do anything?

Speaker 3:          00:25:58       Well, the whole, who knows who exactly, who knows what the fuck happened. And he's one of the cop, he's a cop that got arrested and charged two felonies. You know, I think that if you're a fucking biker and you're with a bunch of bikers, right. This shit, it's your responsibility to not get close to SUV is if you can avoid it. No, but like what just happened right there, no matter what that guy did, you don't do that well that was a gap to the guy ruin it. Ran over.

Speaker 4:          00:26:23       Yeah. But I mean, if that guy does that too, I dunno the wrong person with a gun in his car. Well, no, no. If it was me. Okay. And I'm disparity of force. Any state in the United States, that is a legal reason for excessive, right? I don't care if you're, especially for police officers, if you're a police officer and three guys come at you, even if they don't have any weapons in their hands, you are justified to use deadly force. Because this disparity of force, no man is, no one person is expected. You know, there's nothing in the law that says you've got to take an ass whipping. Yeah, I mean even if this is one on one, if the guy's a bad motherfucker know yes. If, if you're a woman, if you're a female, say you're 120 pound a year. A man either that if you're 120 pound man, what have your hundred and 80 and the guys won 60 and he's got a good punch.

Speaker 4:          00:27:18       Shoot that motherfucker now. And the will note now that that is, that can be argued that if you have a guy that's, you know, if you know, if you're a guy that weighs the same as, I dunno, pick a fighter and then a fighter of the same stature who was documented as being a fighter, tries to beat this guy up and he pulls a weapon and kills him. He has a legit defense that don't mean he's going to win. But here's the one thing, if you're talking about multiple odds, disparity of force is almost every state that I've looked at is a legitimate cause for the use of escalation to deadly force. So that means if three or four people come at you, even if they don't have guns and you do have a gun, you don't have to take an ass whooping. We don't have to let four people kick your fucking head in just because they don't have a gun or a weapon.

Speaker 4:          00:28:09       Disparity of force should be one person. If you're not a candy person, can be someone who knows how to fight once to kick your ass. You don't know how to fight your.man, you're gonna get knocked unconscious and the guy's going to stomp you to death while you're on the ground. And that's the thing that is that. And, and in most states, that's the reason why is because once you get knocked out, you're dead. Yeah. If a guy wants to kill you and the more you're on Worldstar hip hop, right? Oh, there's a great video that, uh, unfortunately it's not available for free, but it's a, it's, it's a mindset video that I think a lot of people should watch it. It's by a guy named Paul how Paul How's a Delta force operator who was on the ground for Mogadishu, uh, for the Black Hawk down scenario.

Speaker 4:          00:28:57       And he made a video and he's a, he's a law enforcement trainer now mainly also does civilian classes. But he has a class about mindset and what the mines and his mindset video is. This is that. And I think it's really important in this day and age is because in this day and age, kids, men, women, everyone is taught, if you're, if you're encountered with force or if you're encountered with an APP, you know, aggression, you give up retreat, know if somebody tries to Mug you, give me a wallet. You know, if somebody tries to break into your house, you know, cower and he proves through some videos, he shows examples, but he's Trump. His point is this, is that if your mat with a situation like this, and it's so rare and people like you and I, our lives, but that makes it even more important is because if it ever does happen, you must be prepared.

Speaker 4:          00:29:59       Yeah. And his point is this is like if you give up, if you don't fight, you forfeit all your rights to life. And then he shows some videos for assumption. I'm sure you've seen most of them. You know, the videos of the guys, uh, in Mexico getting their fucking heads chopped off, you know, and he shows videos of the Columbine massacre where they're walking through, uh, you know, the cafeteria. And people are cowering under the tables. What else are they going to do? You know, I mean, that was, that's, that's an argument situation. There's not much a guy could do, right. But the point is, this is it. You're still there. They're still helpless. You know, you, you can do nothing, right? If you don't fight, the only thing you can hope for is that they don't kill you. They kill somebody else. And that mindset of never give up, you know, if you're going to die, die a good death.

Speaker 3:          00:30:58       I think there's a point of view from a lot of people that, um, have, they don't have violent tendencies and they're intimidated by violent tendencies. There's a point of view where they want to eliminate all the strength in the world. They want to take away all the benefits of being armed. All the, the, you know, there's, there's a bunch of people that discourage martial arts. I've, I've, I've, I've actually had that argument. I had that argument with my family when I started doing martial arts because I was kind of a fucked up kid. And, uh, my, uh, my father was really worried that I was going to become a much more efficient, dangerous person. Right. You know, that I was a, a kind of a sketchy kid and then now I've become a sketchy kid who knows how it was dismantled people. Right. And it was a real issue.

Speaker 3:          00:31:42       Um, like with me when I was 14 years old. And I think that there's a lot of people that are not inclined to physicality, not inclined to violence, not inclined to aggression that would like to silence those things in other people instead of deal with the inevitable reality that those things exist. And whenever someone tells me, you know, they started talking about like, you know, a, you know, if this guy said that I would beat his ass or that I, you know, there's a certain amount of that that it'll tolerate until I get to a certain point. Like, do you really, do you know what you would do? Do you really know what you would do? Have you ever been in a violent confrontation? Have, do you know how to fight, do not to fight when it's important? Do you know how to fight? If someone said, are you ready?

Speaker 3:          00:32:19       Are you ready? Go. What'd you be able to keep your shit together? Right? Most likely not. If you've never kept your shit together before, if you never had that experience and whether or not you've proven your, your, your strength of character, I'm going to be honest with you. You're going to shit your pants. You're going to Piss your pants right. You're going to shit your pants. You're going to fall apart. As soon as the guy gets a hold of you, you're going to be breathing so hard. You're not going to able to control your heart rate. You're not going to be able to do it. You just, unless you've really thought about this, this is not some sort of like easily manageable situation. Real violence is incredibly scary and incredibly scary. And if you don't address that as a, as a reality of life and the of life that existed from fucking 4 billion years ago when the first shitty little single celled organism crawled out of the ocean to what happens today in, in 2013 in Los Angeles, there's, there's a reality to biological life that you are a fucking part of.

Speaker 3:          00:33:11       And just by painting this Utopian picture of reality doesn't make the dangerous aspects of reality go away and your a want to control nature. It's like, it's an idealistic sort of a point of view, this Utopian view of the world, but no one's violent. No one's, you know, have the best achieve that strength uniformly across the board. And that's, that's a hard thing for people to describe for people to swallow. But the, the, the most safe environments I've ever been in when I've been around trained killers, right? The least amount of street fights that have ever been at. Where at the UFC, when I'm at the USC and I'm backstage, I've seen one or two scuffles ever amongst the biggest, most insane killers. The planners ever known. It comes to hand to hand combat. Right. Seemed like a few arguments seem to huge dudes. Slap dudes, you know, over hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of fights. Even

Speaker 4:          00:34:03       when you get egos. I mean, yeah, he goes, well, yeah, but even guys who do that, their ego is checked. Yes. Because they know that as good as they are, at some point they got clipped or even that, it's one of those things to where it goes back to there's Jeff Cooper is what's Jeff Colonel Jeff Cooper is considered the father of the modern pistol technique. No, hear me out. Most of the things, it sounds kind of silly or gay. No, it doesn't at all. But most of the talking about pistols. Yeah, but, but we'll hear, hear me out. Martial arts or martial arts. Oh yeah, I agree. They really are. Whether you're fighting with your hands or this swords, guns, knives. It really is. You're talking about fighting. And the difference is when you're talking about, uh, fighting with guns and knives, the differences, there's a force vector there and there's a great James Edwards, I can't think of his name, but he made a great point.

Speaker 4:          00:35:03       And that's this. If you and I are fighting, I can block your punch. Okay? I can take a block. Or if I miss and you hit me, chances are maybe I can take a punch. You know, maybe you might not nec, knock me out if you hit me with a punch. But when you start talking about fighting with weapons from steel up into bullets, those are force vectors. Now, if we're fighting with knives or we're fighting even with sticks, and I swing, this is a vector, okay? This, this plane is a force vector. If you're in that plane and I have a knife, you're fucked. Bodies cannot take that. If you, if you throw your arm up, even if I haven't got a knife this long, I will cut through both your bones. I'll cut your fucking hand off. Yeah. Now if we're talking about guns, even more fucked.

Speaker 4:          00:35:58       Yeah. So it's forced vectors and it's a different way of looking at fighting. You know when you're talking about hand to hand martial arts, you can take a hit, you can block, you can use that block to Perry, you can use that block to pull into an attack. But when you start talking about fighting with weapons, the only way you can survive is to not be there. Yeah. So not get hit. Right. Not Get cut. Exactly. And so it's just, it's that whole thing of the mindset of being able to accept your on a fight except the conditions you're in and deal with it. And the people who can do that generally are because they understand the fact that they're not fucking invincible. Nobody's a bad ass. Everybody can get hit, knocked out, shot, stabbed, whatever. No matter what your level of training. So when you talk about being backstage with a bunch of guys who spend their lives, understanding that no matter how good you are, no matter how good your ego is, you know, you have to keep that in check.

Speaker 3:          00:36:59       Everybody gets checked her. Holly, nobody starts out the baddest motherfucker ever. You get a few guys like John Jones that come in with exceptional athleticism and they do really, really good right away. But even then, like you look at the Gustafson fight, even he meets a guy one day that handsome, you know, a a handful. And that's also the training that a god goes through. It softens the Ego. It changes the ego's impact on, on your consciousness where you ego will fucking lying to you if you don't get any tests right. If you don't get any real tests in life, your ego will have you all sorts of pumped up, all sorts of confused about your abilities. I've had conversations with people that, you know, I'm the fucking kicked this fucking dude's ass and you know, you, you just want to just, you want to stop time and pull them aside and say, do you understand what you're even saying? Because you don't really just kick a guy's ass. Cause if you kicked my ass, I'm coming back tomorrow with a bat. Okay. Or a gun or my friends and we're gonna fuck you up. I'm not just taking an ass kicking from some pieces of that. That's

Speaker 4:          00:38:01       the difference between when you're talking about sport, you know, UFC blah, blah blah, or this or that. And on the street in real life is, it's, it's funny, I had a, uh, a friend of mine who was a marine and he was an auto worker. The guy had done like six years in the marines. He wanted to be an auto worker and we were drinking the bar all the time. But he said something to me probably 10, maybe 10 years ago, it's always stuck with me. He said, you know what? Nobody's a bad ass. It's just comes down to a question of will you know what? Because if Brock Lesnar whip my motherfucking ass, which he would every day, twice on Sunday, but if I had the will to do whatever the fuck that was required to do something evil to him, if I was willing to go to prison, if I was willing to give up my life, you know what some bad, what happened to him. Right? And it's how you stay alive. Yes, exactly. If I lived, if I survive now, but here's the point, the point is it goes back to will most people, most normal human being people you know, don't think like that. But here's, but here, if you look at every fucked up story in this country when it comes to, Oh my God, this guy did something terrible, or Oh my God, look at how fucked up this is. You know, when it comes down to, it comes down to somebody saying, I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:39:36       Well, somebody recognizing what the situation actually is and then acting. Yeah, well, no, I mean like every panicking, every gangster like criminal motherfucker who's got 40 bodies on them, you know? I mean, if you've watched, what's the movie down in Miami, cocaine cowboys and to dos two was pretty amazing. Well, you talking about Zelda is still alive. Well, she got smoked and Columbia in 2012 yeah, 2012 but then I just got out of jail before, so, no, no. Yeah, she know she was Zelda fucker. Zelda. She's a fucking, oh, but the guy that I was impressed by was the, the other dude that hit me now guy and present. And it was, it was his thing was, you know what, Eh, he's not a tough guy. He's a fucking killer.

Speaker 4:          00:40:26       No, he's not trying to fight you. You know, he, he, he'll wait for you to go home, fall asleep in your bed. They don't come in your house, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:40:34       anyone in your fucking house. Well, you know, another example of the distorted perception of people's in vulnerability is the iceman cook. Kuklinski yeah. That guy. I'm still kind of curious as to how much of his shit was real. Really. Thank you. Bullshit it a lot. I think you had a lot of bullshit or anything that, that was at least my, that was the feeling I got by his interviews. Let's Google iceman bullshit. Nice. And we hope we don't get any chocolate, Dale. But no, I mean, watching Kansas interviews. I, that was the feeling I got. I got the feeling he was a braggart. Really? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:41:06       Interesting. Um, nothing

Speaker 2:          00:41:10       on the first page. That's fair. Ice Man. I mean, Hey, I'm, maybe I'll completely fuck all of bullshit. Let's try. It's full of bullshit. Richard Kuklinski, he's 100% full of shit. Oh, that's the wrong eye span. That's that guy from, uh, the gay guy who got fat. He's not gay. I'll tell you what though, man. You got to admit, I mean, he some legit roles.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       Okay. This is one of the guys saying hard to beat tombstone. He's saying Kuklinski is dangerous and has killed, but not to the extent that he claimed he did not murder Gullah Gullah, Dante Costello or de Mayo. He claimed to have worked with de Mayo. But apparently it's bullshit. I don't know if apparently he exaggerated some things might. He's probably at fuck crazy guy. I mean,

Speaker 4:          00:41:57       no, I mean, that's, yeah, I mean, I absolutely, I don't deny that, but I, I do get the feeling that, and I think that happens with a lot. Um, there are some, if you'd go to the FBI, I think it's fbi.gov on youtube channel. It's like youtube, slash, FBI, whatever. They have a series of interviews with this asshole who was a serial killer. Right. And, uh, he, he, they caught him in Alaska I think, but he killed over 10 or 10 or 15 years, like eight or nine people, something like that. He ended up killing himself, hanging himself in a jail cell and the, but they had, they put on Youtube, the FBI did the fucking interviews with him sitting in the thing. And what's crazy to things that are crazy is one is they're sitting here and they're talking to this guy and they're explaining to him why these other police departments are being assholes about jurisdiction and this and that and why they're holding up certain things. It sounds like he's buying a house and the fucking realtors trying to explain to him, you know, why it's taken longer because they haven't got their clearances. But anyway, but this dude is, it kind of looks like him not being an asshole, but he's Stan, you know, kind of long air. No, good luck. Good looking cat.

Speaker 3:          00:43:14       You know, someone's going, no. Does that him? Yes. While it does have it you Jamie, right. Told you dog how each do 2012 Jamie wasn't working for me and Joan had to tell them, well, you're in Alaska Bro. Did you hang yourself and go,

Speaker 4:          00:43:31       I've watched some. Uh, but here's what's so freaky about this motherfucker. He didn't know his victims didn't stock them. He had a murder kit hidden and he was on the west coast. He had property from when he was a kid or something like that. And a New York did his family left him or whatever he stashed or murder kit in New York and the murder kit had like a tape, a fucking gloves, uh, rope, all this other kind of shit. He was living on the west coast the whole fucking time. He flew back to New York and evidently he had seen or or or seen some kind of house or whatever, but he flies back to New York, kills two people, man in her life, dispose of their body just mysteriously. I then flies back. They didn't catch him until like 10 or 15 years later. So he did this several times. Yes. So his is Emma was that he did not know that. Yeah. He would just pick random as victims. Had nothing

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       in common. How they catch him? Uh, he, I think a chick got away from him. Yeah, it Alaska, well there was one guy and I don't know if it's the same guy in the last kid that would a fly women out. It would tell them that he was going to fly them, like pay like prostitutes, fly them out to a place where they're going to get your freak on and a, and then he would tell them like, listen, you have one hour and in one hour I'm going to come find you and I'm going to shoot you and kill you. Stop it. Yeah. So good luck. Take care. You got one hour ready go or whatever it was the whole, the amount of time was and he would go hunting for women and he killed several. Yeah. La, I'll pull it up. What did you kill the ones that he was like or just like random ones or what'd he kill?

Speaker 3:          00:45:15       The ones I keep was at after. Oh, the ones who was after he would, he was up on the left there. If somebody said that to me, I would be like, where's the nearest fucking police station, because you won't get me out of there. His name is Robert Hanson and, uh, he's an American serial killer, is born in 1939 and he killed between 17 and 21 women near Anchorage, Alaska. He was convicted in 1983 and is currently serving 461 years and spring creek correctional centers alive and Seward. Alaska. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And a 1983, 17 year old, Cindy Paulson escaped from him while he was trying to load her into his Piper Super Club, which is apparently his airplane type of jet that lands. And, uh, he was, uh, loading her into this, uh, airplane and she escaped. But did, did, did. And, uh, she told police that she had been offered $200 to perform oral sex, but when she got into the car dollars in Alaska and Navia like eight beavers, he pulled a gun on her and drove her to his home town of Mole Dune.

Speaker 3:          00:46:27       And there he took her captive, a torturing, raping and sexually assaulting her. He mentioned that she mentioned that after a he chained her by the neck to a post in the houses basement. He took a nap on a nearby couch and when he awoke, he put her in his car and took her to the Merrill Field Airport where he told her that he intended to take her out to his cabin, which was a meet Shaq on the Nic River area of a Matt to new Tsca valley accessible only by boat or Bush plane. That's the gangster move, right, because they can't get out. They can't go anywhere. And crouched to the backseat of the car with her risks cuffed behind her body. She waited until Hanson was busy loading the airplane's cockpit to make a run for it. And while Hanson's back was turned, she crawled out of the back seat, opened up the driver's side door and took off running near Sixth Avenue, a nearby sixth avenue. She told police that she had left her blue sneakers on the passenger side floor. This is a dance back seat as evidence that she had been in the car. So, um, they, they pulled them over and they found it. They found her, her, uh, her, her, you know, they, they, uh, pulled over the truck and found her sneakers and knew that she was telling the truth.

Speaker 4:          00:47:40       Do you know what's fucked up? If you go back and you look, I mean, there's a ton of stories like that, man, I've never heard of that one. And I generally, I mean, I'm not like a serial killer freak or anything, but I mean, I pay attention to like certain things, but I've never heard that story. And I guarantee if you look back, you could probably find a hundred more like it, different things. Maybe not that many people, but three or four, one or two, whatever. But it goes back to my opinion that, you know what, there are fucking monsters out there, bro. Yeah. Well this guy was an hunting champion. I mean there, there are fucking people out there. They're legit monsters.

Speaker 3:          00:48:18       This guy was a monster. He was a monster. He loved to kill things. He was a world. He was a Hyundai champion. He hits established, uh, several documented records in the pope and young book of world hunting records. So this guy was like, he was a legit hunter, but it was not exciting enough to him. So he had decided that, you know what? He was in payments. Hunting women. Yeah. He's, it's a scary, scary, scary thing. And you look at them on the fucker. His name is Robert Hanson. Google it on a Wiki.

Speaker 4:          00:48:47       That's crazy. Cause Robert Hanson is the same guy who was a spy for a, so the FBI wasn't, yeah, Robert Hansen was a spy for, I want to say FBI counterterrorist

Speaker 3:          00:48:58       same. Same Dude. No good. No. Google. Robert Hanson. FBI. That's not the same guy. Robert Hansen, that's the A, I'm sure that's the FBI guy. Robert Hanson on Wikipedia. H a. N. S. E. N. That's him. Creepy fuck killed. 21 women at least. At least 21 if they clicked them for 21 you know it's more, yeah, between 17 and 21 is the number that they're there. But that's, that's true. But then sometimes, sometimes they lead others.

Speaker 4:          00:49:26       Yeah. Right. Because they do the shit where they write off every unsolved on earthing, chalk it up to them. And we,

Speaker 3:          00:49:32       which a serial killer or did you ever see that documentary? Not Documentary. It was a docu drama. It was a, I don't do docu dramas. I hate that shit. It was based on the Henry Lee Lucas. Is this a weird drifter that randomly killed people and confess to a shitload of crime they never got, was it the Green River killer? They never got Zodiac killer. So the actually they never, we never got the Zodiac guy. Yeah. Yeah. They have a lot of different theories on who that guy was from a mathematician to, you know, various high intellect people.

Speaker 4:          00:50:06       That's some creepy shit. I mean, what do you think the guy went to prison when you think he's, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:50:11       I don't know. They don't quit right now. Most of them don't quit. But who knows what makes someone start ready go. And who knows whether or not they can ready stop. You know, some people can stop drinking and some people, they don't need alcoholics anonymous. Some people quit heroin. You know? I don't know. Maybe. So I've always wanted real killer. I've always wondered that

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       if you were going to do, and it's been a fucking plot on a million television shows, but it's the idea that, okay, if you're going to off somebody for whatever reason, if you make them fourth in a series of six, yeah. All of a sudden now it's not an assassination. Right. It's a serial killing. Well, the other thing they say is that if it's random, if you just pick random people who just pull into a gas station, you know, go up, hey, can I get a pack of gum? Boom. There's that where it's almost impossible to solve. It's crazy. Like if you look at unsolved and like certain cities like Chicago, DC, other things, it's like 70% unsolved homicides. Yeah, because dude, I tell you what, there's a fun Mas. It's a phenomenal book. You ought to read. Did you ever watch the movie or you've seen the wire television show?

Speaker 2:          00:51:21       The why? I've only seen actually the first couple of episodes. I never kept watching it. I know I failed culturally. Dude, I'm telling you I'm not and I don't, I'm not saying that to be a breaking bad hipster. I'm not a breaking bad type prick. Who Back to Madison? No, I watched the first season. Fuck off. You didn't like it. The wires. The wire, it gives it the six. Both of you can suck. Suck Dick. Because I think that game of Thrones can conquer all of them. What? How hard is it to where everyone dies? It doesn't matter. How hard is that? Everyone dies. Dragons come back next seasons we'll give you new people to love so we can kill them. How about zombies? Do you like a walking dead? Not so much area. Not so much. Yeah, it's decent. But what, okay, here's your question on zombies.

Speaker 2:          00:52:08       As long as you're doing zombies. Loved the book, World War Z. I thought it was fucking amazing. Love that book. Interesting. I thought it was kind of slow. Really. I got it out there. Yeah. I thought the book was to kind of slow. No Shit. Yeah. What'd you think about the movie? Well, Brad Pitt is a beautiful man and a, he's got an excellent symmetry and uh, his wife, I thought it was very tastefully chosen. I thought it was interesting that the violence was, uh, you know, really like, so sort of like non impactful, you know, it's like the coolest thing about the whole fucking movie literally was the Rangers at the airplane for, you know, that was a check. No, no, but the one no, but where the dude was like, hey look, fuck you. We're going to get you to the plane. Right. I hope it's worth it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:57       Right. That's legit, dude. That is legit as is the fucking pyramid of zombies. And they tried to cry. That was gay. Climb up the wall of drawers. That was fucking gay. Have you ever read the book? Uh, it's not violent. 28 days later was on bs. Yeah, that slow shambling never ending on slot then World War z. The book. Yeah. Yeah. That's what's so fucking terrifying. And that's, to me that was what made the book cool. I disagree. I prefer the 28 days later sprinting Zombie. That's my kind of Zombie new age, French fucking Greek war z book slash you know, walking dead. Listen, I'll fuck those zombies up. This bitches are never catching. But here's the thing, they never get tired. Yeah, that's true. They never give up. But you can figure out a way to get into a house. Shut my door, take a nine or they never give up.

Speaker 2:          00:53:51       And that's all that door down. That to me was a cool, and don't get me wrong, I think Max Brooks is a self-important prick. How dare you, I'm just telling you first of all, how dare you. You don't even know Max. I don't know Max. But I've watched, I've watched a lot of interviews with him cause he, it Dick, in my opinion. Wow. I could be wrong. He might be the nicest guy in the world. Might be tired of giving interviews, could be, but you know, he's Mel Brooks son till he was rich before he started. Also tired of people asking them about his dad being Mel Brooks and how much of an impact that has on his career. And it might be fine, but hey, if the checks were all good, I'll be nice to you. You know who Joe Hill is? No, he's Stephen King's son, but he changed his name to Joe Hill, so I didn't ride on the coattails of Stephen King, smarmy, amazing author, great author.

Speaker 2:          00:54:34       Really, really good stuff. And by the way, same genre. Stephen King, horror movies, hard books. Great, great, great stuff. That's cool. I didn't know that. Yeah, he's, he's really interesting. One of my favorite authors and he, Stephen King's son. It's incredible. But he's Joe Hill, you know, and I think he's got his own following the smart move. You know when your back's Brooks Brooks, Mel Brooks, Mel Brooks Son, Jim, Mel Brooks son. Look at you. You have grown up. I've known you since you were a little boy. Oh my goodness. Mel Brooks son is here. Honey, come here. But like every interview I've seen when that dude, like I'm a big book TV freak, you know, span all that bullshit. I watch all that stuff. 28 days later. Zombies role. Yes. Especially when you look at the production of that, that movie, how they did that 20 days later, it's sick. They run, they gave him like fucking, they made that movie with like $88 and a fucking credit card.

Speaker 2:          00:55:29       Yeah. They just shut down in London for a day and they got their major shot and that was it. Yeah, that's it. Everything else was filmed on an iPhone. I think just fucking guys are gangster. I think 28 days later, zombies and this carriers, the ones that run rage virus absolute on there. They're freaky. But at the same time, like a, I read a book how Steve, not Steven Pressfield, um, I can't think of that guy's name, but he makes a, an interesting argument that if you look at zombies like locusts, imagine now millions of them. Think about this now. If you have a life form that I can't believe we're getting this diva in the fucking zombies with deep and Zam. But think about it. Okay, New York City, perfect example. 7 million people in New York City right now, they all turned a zombies. They don't die, you know, so they gotta go somewhere and they're going to search out food. The one instinct they is go to food. Where are you gonna

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       go? You're gonna go north. We're going to go south if you can get off the fucking island. So anyway, so now you come south, say they come south. Now they come through all the east coast, Philadelphia, Virginia, all the bullshit. They come around the Alleghenies. Where are they gonna go? They're going to go west. And as they come, they keep picking people up. Perfect examples. You look at the locus, the great locust plagues, you know, do the locust starved to death? No, because they go to the next fucking field to keep going. So now imagine this. Yes, you can be the biggest bad ass in the world with all the fucking weapons you want, but now you're overran with millions of something. No matter what it is. Imagine was millions of rats. Fuck zombies. But I mean millions of anything. It's just fucked. Fuck Bro. It's scary.

Speaker 4:          00:57:11       Scary. That was what, that was the cool part about Max Brooks, his book is that he got that across was he got across that, that feeling of humanity, you know, even if you, when you almost lose because you can kill them, but every time you lose a person, it's a win for the enemy. Right. It's not the fact that you lost one. It's the fact that you lost one and they gained one. Right. So you do that times 100,000 that's a 200,000 it's like gambling. It's a 200,000 swing. You know, you're down a hundred they're up a hundred right, right, right. So, but, but that idea of that relentless never ending, just constant, you know, to me that is a different feeling in that fiction world. Of course then the whole rates not be thing. Yeah. The range. The range thing is scarier on film because it's like motherfuckers flipping out at you from nowhere, but it's that shambling never ending, you know? Okay, you want to kill a 5,000 of us? Okay. Eventually your rifle barrels going to wear out before we do kills many as you want.

Speaker 2:          00:58:25       I feel like the outlaw Josey Wales with a Gatling gun from 1865 said good to de de de, De, De, De, de, De de digit, digit out of the back of a wagon. Arrows wouldn't melt, bro. It'd be barrels wouldn't melt or you would just go inside and take on. Speaking of which, speaking of which, if, if that's not one of the best movies ever in history of life, I'm going to send these boys on a Missouri a boat ride. Joey ideas is probably seen that movie 300 times. Fucking Judaism will call me up. Have you ever seen the movie

Speaker 4:          00:59:00       Jeremiah Johnson? Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:59:03       I just turned it. I just turned our buddy Austin on in that movie. There's something about those, the movies from that era, you know that were, that was my point. Amazing. That was my original point. The God damn man. Shit. Look at the movies we're talking about Jeremiah Johnson, butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid. I mean, when they're booking, jump off bandit son. I mean the band is very manly, but when, when butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid or brought the jump off that cliff and they're like, can you swim? No, it doesn't matter. The fall's going to probably kill you anyway. Shot. And the end of that motherfucker, that's probably the coolest end of any movie when those flash dance. I'm not flashdance Guy Bro. But I remember butch and Sundance when they go out of that Shell girl have a, other than showgirls, the only thing I remember about showgirls is when she got the guy off through his pants. Hmm. Interesting. I remember this. Why are you crazy? The fall will probably kill you. How fucking gangsters that,

Speaker 1:          01:00:11       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       Redford and Newman and they're fucking prime.

Speaker 1:          01:00:17       Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:00:19       oh

Speaker 1:          01:00:21       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:25       Wow. Dude, that's got nothing on Jeremiah Johnson. I just watched it. And the end, there was a sequence in Jeremiah Johnson, Robert Redford in the fucking Rockies in Utah before he bought, uh, the Sundance Park city thing. And the way that movie got made was the director, uh, what's his name? Sydney Pollack. I think Sydney Pollack put up his fucking house to borrow the money to make the, to make the movie because they ran out of money because the locations were so expensive. It's a great story, but what if he found a rich guy and sucked his dick for the money? It wouldn't be as good as story. It could be possible. You know what I'm saying? Like people make sacrifices. I don't think you'll respect certain sacrifices, but he's like Sydney Pollack, Sean, this rich guy and sucked his dick and got $100 million. What would depend on how good the movie is depending on how good you think about it, it's now think about, think it would depend on how good a mood [inaudible] skills are. Tariff, he made Jeremiah Johnson, I'll be like, hey, fuck it. I respect that. I respect the commitment. If you made, I dunno, I would be like, he's a fool.

Speaker 2:          01:01:32       I hope that load was weak. I hope it was a very like the third load of the day to where it was just like dust. It was just a confusing dust to where I was like, you know, it didn't even, it didn't even go from hard to soft. It was just kind of me. Yeah. You know, just halfway there. Yeah. It was like a fucking cookie low. There's nothing violent or as passionate about it. And I just like, ah, fuck, look at that picture. The producers like God, it and another one frozen dudes are scary. Yeah. Hashi Jack, that's Hatchet Jack. The scariest shit to me is when the show those photographs of guys who tried to climb Everest and failed and they find their bodies face down. Like the first guy that airs mother named Everest Sisters. Motherfuckers on Everest been there forever and we'll be there. The first guy to climb Mount Everest is there. There will be there. Yeah. That was actually, that was actually one of my,

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       a little fucking, uh, what was I saying? Uh, what's the word I'm looking for? Goddammit. The, uh, examples of manhood? No. Um, niche. Like a niche. It's a niche or niche. No, the, a subculture goddamn culture subculture, which is that the Himalayan over 8,000 meter climbers, but I mean, frozen to the ground, they leave them up there. There's hundreds of, yeah, but the fucked up thing about ever since, it's basically, it's like Disneyland. Yeah. It's a fucking tourist park. You could go climb Everest next year if you want it to. I mean, you, you pay a guy 15 grand, you roll up there, they give you your shit, and if you make it, you make it. And if not, fuck it. They send you back down. Keep your money. The freaky shit is fucking Kaytoo. That's worse. K Two is like the killer just mountain in the world. There's an article from 2012 where they're trying to reclaim the dead,

Speaker 4:          01:03:18       uh, from Everest. This is, this is pretty interesting. Uh, if you read what's Ed Viesturs, v I, e. S t, U. R. S. Edvestors. There's like seven or eight guys who have climbed every mountain over 8,000 meters. I, there's 14 of them, 14 mountains in the world that are higher than 14,000 meters. There's seven or eight guys. You've climbed them. All. Ed Features is an American. He's climbed them all without oxygen. He's climbing phrases. It's a fucking gangster. Some Seattle area, but a shadow area. Seattle. Oh, did I say West Coast? West Coast. I was like, is this more soldier fortunate time to talk West Coast Seattle.

Speaker 6:          01:04:02       Um, but

Speaker 4:          01:04:05       do you know why? Because when you live in Seattle, it rains all the time easily. You have a willing to risk your life for shit. I think it was ray near, but he's got an interesting uh, yeah, right there. That's him.

Speaker 6:          01:04:18       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:04:18       What's crazy is he talks about the, I've got, I've read that book. That's a great book. But what he talks about is like, there was a couple of clients he was on where he turned back and he got like the first time I think he was on Everest is Everest or k two. He was like six or 700 meters from the top and he turned around and he said, you know, because you know if you don't come down alive it doesn't count. Right. And that's part of, that's what gets a lot of guys killed. Right? They just need to pull it off. Exactly. They get within that thousand meters and a lot of guys will set a turnaround times to where they have, like if it's a drop dead time, if you're not on the summit by two o'clock if you're one fucking foot from it,

Speaker 6:          01:05:08       you'd come back

Speaker 4:          01:05:09       because you have to build in time for shit to go wrong. Right. And if you don't, you die. A lot of guys die. How many guys have jerked off on the top of Everest? I want to

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       be the first you think anybody ever has, I dunno. I'd like to be numero uno. 15 grand. You'd give it a shot, that's all. Yeah. What I get out of it.

Speaker 2:          01:05:27       You think how much you can take a phone? What would you jack off to? You'd be like, you have to have to fund the next round. What are all those bodies? That's the line of people they ever go up. Yes. Oh, that's ridiculous. It's okay to say now. It is. Exactly. That's insane. It is. This, this thing we're looking at is like a line at Disneyland. It is like a line of defense is different in the fact that there's been three. I mean there's been a lot of years when no one's home.

Speaker 3:          01:05:56       Let's k two there are 200 between 200 and 233 bodies up on Everest. Google, k to see how many, see how many people summited k two this year. I'm fascinated by goals like that and the goals of climbing all the mountains, all the over 30,000 mountain right now I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm absolutely fascinated by like goals, like these big lofty goals and only a few people have ever achieved. One of them is a, the you, you know what the Super Slam is? The Super Slam is a for big game hunters. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:06:31       Lion. It's an elephant.

Speaker 3:          01:06:33       Everything in North America, North America, the North American gay male animals, the Super Slam. It's a sheep, Brown bear, black bear. Grizzly bear, polar bear by Brown bear, Alaska Bear Brown bear and Grizzly bear or the same thing, right? Same thing. Yeah. So this, this might have been established. It might be that their treat they take methylate bag. Yes. Yes. Canada, the um, North America Brown bear and Grizzly bear according to Steve or on the differences, the grizzlies inland and the brown bears on the coast and the ground brown bears actually grow larger, much too popular or much to a, the what? Most people don't. They're all mean as fuck rounders in general. Brown bears just get my protein. They're getting salmon on a regular basis. Mass Black Bears Sandman Caribou, Moose, they get everything. The, the massive amounts of salmon. They get fucking tremendous. Um, grisly polar bear. And then with cats, it's a cougar and they might even add Jaguar. You know, there is a real issue off American cars. No North America, the fuck out of the are entering through Mexico into north

Speaker 2:          01:07:41       illegal fucking cats, bro. Hey, the illegal cast blame fucking same roads that drug dealers, a trans, this crisis or problem. You know what? There probably is fucking strapping cocaine to these jaguars, right in their assholes, right in their assets. And how much you would pay for the coastline, Jaguar of an asshole. It would be worth so much more than regular coke. Wait. Yeah man, it's cold. Came through. It came from a drug, will talk to the dude. Stop this cocaine came out with Jaguars asshole. This is the Jaguar. It's caught on a trail cam duct tape on his ass water to gram 200 grants. I'm real.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       They're starting to find them in a, especially in New Mexico and Arizona, they're starting to find jaguars that have made their way from, uh, from Mexico. Big fucking cats. 200 plus pounds. I don't think Jaguar's got that day. I thought Jaguars were like house like bobcat's and go, oh no, no, no, no. Jaguars are enormous. They're much bigger than mount lines. 50 pounds. I'm outlines a fucking cougar, bro. Yeah. Jaguars a bigger shit. If I could have any pet on earth and not have it kill me, it would be a cougar. Apparently pound for pound. Jaguars are the most powerful cats. Really. Yeah, they're really fun. They're like drag chute up and trees. Right. Like kill it and drag it up in the tree. Crocodiles, get out of here. Do you ever see a Jaguar go after Crongo pull up Jaguars, jaguars, Black Panther, right. They sometimes are black but most of the time they are blonde with black spots.

Speaker 3:          01:09:05       But sometimes the spots cover their entire body and they become black. It was just a genetic predisposition or a, you know, a genetic choice. Just like some dogs are black, some dogs are white. Yeah. That's how it is. And uh, the black ones are the fucking scariest shit ever. And the jungle of the Amazon called panthers, right. They are the same thing. So I would have Florida Panther cancer is a Puma is a mountain lion. A Jaguar is a larger cat. So fucking animal. Yeah, they're spotted there. Spotted. But the black ones, look at this mother fucker. That's, that's Jaguar that said, it's not bigger than a cougar bro. A hundred pound cat and my friend, that's not a cougar. It's America's much no incorrect. That's a 200 pound Jaguar and that Jaguar, it's going to matches up this fucking crock of and bites it with one punch, one punch to the back of the head.

Speaker 3:          01:09:54       These mother fuckers hunt everything that lives, everything, anything that walks in the ground. Occasionally this Jaguar eats, eats everything in the Amazon. Look at this motherfucker. I'm making a run for this thing. Making a run for a crocodile. What does the crocodile do? Panics. Well, yeah. I mean what the fuck would you do? You don't know what would happen if you ran out of crocodile. Nothing rocket. I would open its mouth and eat. Thank you. The crocodile sees this Jaguar. I was like, Oh fuck this shit bitch. Look at this. This jag. Drag it out of the fucking like eating a crocodile man. Do you understand the significance of this? That's a crocodile he killed with his face. He doesn't even fucking live in the water cause you imagine how strong you would have to be. The carry something that weighs as much as you do out of the water.

Speaker 3:          01:10:44       Look at the look on his face. Look how he's biting this thing. Biting. I'm the Cha. Tired of your shit. He's biting it through. It's Shit I haven't eaten since Wednesday. Yeah, and they also have the ability to pull those things apart with your face. Look at the eyes and that motherfucker. Cats have the most murderous, evil, soulless eyes. That's a legit murderers, man. They're killers. Don't kill this. And it's in the water. This house. Yeah. I have a sweetie, sweetie cat that I've had for 16 years. She just killed a bird. The other killed a million birds. You don't know about. Just

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       killed one the other day. Right on a fucking shrine underneath the couch. Look at this. It's a bird made out of feathers. Biting on top of his skull. Right. Carrying around tears up. Shit. There's a whole series of Jaguars like get them from the bottom. Just rips them apart. Slowly, but sure. It's dead already now it's a matter of just opening it up. The g, the Jaguar is so strong with his job. He can a stone killers. Have you gotten any more hunting this year? What's Word I'm going next month. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to a Wisconsin, I'm going to go shoot some, some deer hollow, and then when I come back and a late, late a winter, I'm going to go shoot a buffalo in Texas. Woo. They just stand there. We ought to go shoot hogs brought to meet runs. I got a guy in Texas has got a ranch.

Speaker 2:          01:12:01       Let's do it. She was telling me when I can hook it up. Okay. It's done. I mean, it's nuisance game down there, so it's just a matter of going down them. We've talked about it many times. One of my favorite shows is pig man. Pick Dan's a show in the sportsmans channel and uh, him and Ted Nugent shot hogs out of a helicopter. That would be a heat. One time they killed two 15 a day. The next time it was more than 400, 250 more than 400. The loud. You want to know. It's funny now I was talking to my buddy gets the guy who knows a guy that in Texas, he's like, yeah man, we've been talking about it forever. We're going to take like 50 pounds of Tannerite. What's Tannerite. That sounds bad. You know, a Tannerite is showing what tannerite is. Google Tanner writer, check this out.

Speaker 2:          01:12:47       Jesus Christ. So this is the, uh, what we were talking about. This is the finished the Super Slam. These are the, these are the animals, Alaskan brown bear, black bear, grizzly bear, polar bear, Cougar, Columbia blacktail deer. That's like $100,000 with a hunt. More than that. Cuzdey or mule deer, Sitka deer, whitetail deer, rocky mountain, elk grove, my God. Stop Chill Elk. Way more barren ground Caribou, central Canadian barren ground, Caribou, mountain Caribou, Quebec, Labrador, Caribou, woodland Caribou, Alaska, Yukon Moose, Canadian, Moose and Caribou to get bison Musk ox. A Musk ox is in north American game. Animal style. Now I've heard everything. Uh, American mountain goat, pronghorn and obvious outfitters or making this California big sheep. Dall, sheep desert, big horn sheep, rocky mountain bighorn sheep. Don't cheap. I'll Atlantic Walrus. These are the auxiliary stop. Celia, Larry Animals, auxiliary auxiliary. They get the Jaguars in there and Pacific Walrus. That's all of them.

Speaker 2:          01:13:46       Know who the fuck is going to shoot a walrus. And here's where I draw the line. Who needs to share? Here's where I draw a line, man. I, I'm not, I did hunting. That's fine. I'm not a hunter because I don't have the patience for it. Um, but I respect it. I understand that hunters pay for their whole hunters are the whole fucking reason most of this shit. What is this, right? Yes. Temperature. She walks right Tanner, right? This is like, it's in a Bacardi bottle. Billy Express. Okay. And so I'm assuming it's an explosive. Yes, it is. Okay. So this guy backs way up. Yes. And detonates it Tannerite is a binary explosive to where you put these two things together and then it's detonated. It has to be, the only way it can be set off is by sea. It's completely fucking legal. You can buy it in the mail, but it's a binary explosive.

Speaker 2:          01:14:39       And the fact that the only way it can be set, you can set fire to it. You can sell electricity to it. You can fucking jump up and down on it. The only way that we'll get set off is if it's penetrated by around going almost 300 feet per second. So you have to hit it with a rifle round and that will set it off. But otherwise it's completely, absolutely, it's illegal just because people don't know about it. Like there was a psychedelic, sorta most powerful psychedelic drug ever that was legal for the longest time. Really missed it. And the sweeping sites that like some shit out of a human pituitary gland from a fucking mail baby with one eye. Similar, but no, it's called five methodoxy die methyl trip to me and five methoxy dimethyltryptamine five meo dynamic felt like a big stash of that Preben shit

Speaker 5:          01:15:25       somewhere you to meet if you want to meet,

Speaker 2:          01:15:31       I can bring into Oden's chambers if you truly want to meet him. Um, yeah, still doing that. Oh yeah, I got one of my basement. Yeah. Yeah. Well I'll try it. Fuck No. That scare the shit. I be scared. Oh, I'm telling you bro. Now this tank's doesn't slavery. The tank is easy to faith. It's great on your body. Feels good. It's relaxing. That's, you're into this whole fucking self, you know, I know better.

Speaker 5:          01:15:56       No better have

Speaker 2:          01:15:59       no desire to get up in that fucking mess. Well, um, the, uh, the tank thing for me that's a big part of like every day is a big part of life. No Shit. Big Part of thinking. Yeah. The tank is where I sorted. Right. Sorted it all out. How often do you use it? What's in my basement? So, well, I've got a lot of shit in my fucking within arms reach. Last time I used it was two days ago. Yeah. That's great. How long do you use it for? A few hours. I like to go on fat loss that time. The time to were freaked out. If you ever been like, fuck this. Fuck, how do I get out? No, no, no. Every freak out that I've ever had has been a good one. I've learned from them. Every freak out that I've ever had, I'd be like, well, what was bothering me?

Speaker 2:          01:16:40       What was the free, why was I freaking out? Yeah. What was the freak out about? What weakness was, you know, was exposed by that freak out. What a in balance with what thing that I don't like. I mean were you're able to do that in the tank or, yeah. Yeah. You got a little carried away and then you backed off or what? It's all about breathing and perspective. It's all about keeping your breathing under control. Don't let panic breaths. Like the big thing about psychedelic trips that happened with a lot of people, whether they're naturally occurring psychedelic trips, like a tank, meditation

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       or drugs. The big thing is you trying to control what's happening and when you try to control what's happening, it's just you can't control a bitch. Good luck. It's like going down a river, you know, like some crazy fucking,

Speaker 2:          01:17:25       what is that airplane? Is that an airplane vacuum? Why this awhile? What do they vacuum? I think it's an airplane with a vacuum on it and I say, Bro,

Speaker 3:          01:17:35       you're, if you're going down a river and you know your, your, your body's flailing and flailing around like, and you try to like control it, you can't control it. You know, if you're bouncing off rocks and shit and you're completely out of control in the white waters, you can't control it. The difference between that and a psychedelic trip is it the psychedelic trip is actually not going to kill you. Whereas the the out of control feeling that you have in a river, there's, it's inevitable. Like you, you, you may get lucky and grab a branch on the way down, but you may also go off the waterfall and die. Sure. The difference between that and the psychedelic experiences, there's nothing to worry about and the psychedelic experience, but it's just as much out of your control so you have to be able to let go and it's very, very, very, very, very hard for people to do because you have to let go of all your perceptions about who you are, how you interface with the world, what your environment means to you.

Speaker 2:          01:18:27       The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the circle. I mean, you know, all this shit going in though, right? I learned all this shit going in and I still don't know I could, I could freak out. Well, what happened if you just stuck someone in there like you stuck someone in there. It depends entirely on who that person, if they weren't prepared, if they just, it's like if you fucking threw a hood on them. Yeah, if you just threw a fucking hold on him, snatched him off the street and they woke up in the tank, the tank is, well that would be weird. That'd be like torture.

Speaker 3:          01:18:57       Well no, it wouldn't be tortured cause you would move around. You would feel the water. You, you can't, it's not like your body doesn't move. The beautiful thing about this, the

Speaker 2:          01:19:04       tank is basically, you've got your own Guantanamo Bay in your basement. No, no, no. That's way nicer than that. It's, there's no music blaring. No fucking dogs. Crazy ass holes. And trying to fucking get you to talk about your time as a student in Pakistan. There's none of that. The, the, the tank zero, dark 30. Yes. Yeah, I know you didn't like it because you're, you know, you're up on what all the hell that shit you're fucked up by this suspension of disbelief, you know. But I gotta tell Ya, the dude who was doing the questioning was freaky. He was scary. He was scary because he was so calm. Yeah. Well that's really, look how those guys get. They get very clinical. It was I looking at you lie to me, I'm going to hurt you. Yeah. And then with the, with the fucking, something else I heard that I had never heard before was they were sticking them.

Speaker 2:          01:19:51       My thing, dude, bugs, bugs. Even worse fucking spiders. Yeah. I mean, you know, I'll fight Ya. Okay, fine. But you put a fucking big ass spider right here. I'll scream like a bitch or I'll flip this fucking table trying to kill it. One or the other. But fucking spiders. I hate spiders. But that was one of the things, I guess they played on the phobia as a motherfuckers was they would stick them in these fucking boxes filled with all kinds of bugs and fear factor. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That was one of the reasons why I never watched fear factor. Seriously. The bugs and the spiders and the bullshit. And I always thought, you know, like eating, you know, donkey balls and all that bullshit. I was like, I never could understand it because it's like, what did they win 50 grand? If they win, you have to make it to the final.

Speaker 2:          01:20:42       So sweet. I looked back then and then they play and then they play fucking taxes on it. So they make what? 33 34 yeah, 34 thousands. Um, fuck you. But that's not even fair brow. Some people did it and they did it as nice in fair. Let me tell you something. I guess I'm watching that. I eat one of those for free. Stop it. Yeah, me and Michael. Yo, there was a TV show. It was one of those, what was that like that? Well, Michael Yoh was one that was a, um, uh, African cave dwelling spider and he, me and Michael, we were doing a promo for the new series of fear factor when it came back. And, uh, we both, uh, ate them. It was nothing. I ate it, it was nothing. It was just chewy. It was nothing. Believe me, if you gave me the option between that and a ton of other shit that I've done in my life, I would take that all day.

Speaker 2:          01:21:29       I need to have right in front of you right now. It's nothing. It's like a logical, it is psychologic and that's what's crazy. It's just like it's all psychological. Yeah, totally. I agree. I don't give a fuck though. The well, that's like the tank. What's scary about the idea of the tank is only psychological. There's no tigers in there. There's a Jaguar tank. Doesn't seem like it would freak me the fuck out. Well, you just said it would. No, no, I was saying it. It could like if you took somebody and through the metal know personally me. No, I don't think it would. It's great. You would love it. Personally, I don't think it would. I mean for one thing it's like I like being by myself. No, no, don't get me wrong. But I like, I spend a lot of time reading. I'm not one of those people that, you know, if I don't have inner social interaction every hour, I flipped the fuck out.

Speaker 2:          01:22:13       You know, I mean me and Michael Yo where eating these k kicked willing spiders. Michael. Yeah. Michael. Yeah, he's uh, he's like an entertainment journalist and he was actually on fear factor back way back in the day. Like episode one, the first shows I just pick it up, pick it up and then might in some blue cheese. That's the thing I got so used to like people eating bugs and I got cha, I eat a bunch of shit. I eat a fucking Matt just on the set and you're like, just saw a roach and you were like, no, no, like an Asian girl. Just pick it up. I'm not stupid. They had catering. They had really no need to do it. But it wasn't that it was something I wanted to do, but it's easy to do. It's really not that big a deal. So I give it to him. I'm holding onto too. I hand him one and he had the hardest time grabbing it, man. He was, I don't know if he was playing it up for the camera, but he really seemed to have a heart. Very, very nice guy. But you know what the thing is though, I was so desensitized. I was so used to it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:11       Yeah. This doesn't even interest me. Jesus.

Speaker 7:          01:23:15       Yeah, I would telling him do it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:22       Can, oh, spiders bite. Oh yeah. Get the fuck Outta here. What does this nun, who the fuck's filming this on us? Camera phones. I don't know. Some of the phone. I told him if we lived in caveman times, just that's being, I'm, I'm going to say I hope I would. I would hope I'm not that big of a bitch. I would hope I would reach out. Crush your hand, kill the spider and walk away. It's nothing. You would just take it. You just take it. You, you'd have, it would have to be minimum. We'd have to be talking new car. Money for free. Well that's cause you're crazy. No, I'm not looking at you. He evidently didn't enjoy it. I just eaten it. That's him. That's him. I'm sorry. He's freaking out while Joe's over there like popcorn, like apps more. My bad. Yeah. I'm like, well no.

Speaker 2:          01:24:16       For me to do some shit like that. We're talking minimum 30 Jesus had a diet coke waiting on standby. Minimum Minimum 30,000 you the fucking spiders. Nothing. It's not even worth 100 bucks. Yeah. Whoa. Easy to just what I'm saying. I mean, you know, my price is my price, but I'm just saying that it's all based on personal. Sure. Absolutely. You know, if you ever had someone choke you choke you like almost unconscious. We have to tap out. No, that's way worse. I believe I have that happen all the time. I've done that to people but never got me a bug is it ain't shit. You know? Oh, a young gal give you enthusiastic but yet horrible blowjob. Yes. That's no fun. It's way better to eat a bug. Disagree. Check out these. He's can't grow. Jobs are like pizza. You know there's bad pizza, but need to get someone to suck your Dick.

Speaker 2:          01:25:00       That really has malice in their mind. Share these Kangaroos. Beating the fuck out of each other. This is a video that someone sent me. Apparently this ends with a rear naked choke people. Yeah. People didn't send it to me all day on Twitter. So out of respect, I got to throw it up there. But sweat how these fucking things fight. They go back on their tail, they use their tail to hold themselves up to kick kick with their back legs and they fucking do get out for like 10 minutes. Man. Do they take round breaks? No, they just keep fucking each other up. Look at that. That's like a fucking 120 pound rat. Yeah. Well they get really big apparently. Apparently it's two different types of Kangaroos. I think there's a gray kangaroo and a red kangaroo. Our Buddy Eddie if spends a lot of time and arch Barker's team spends all the time as well in Australia and some of them are really big, like six feet plus.

Speaker 2:          01:25:54       Well there's another, uh, I guess donkeys in Australia are feral. Like pigs are here. I guess I have a lot of trouble with, at least they did at time with donkeys and Kangaroos. Wow. So there's a guy, his name's Jd Jones. This is a gun thing, but um, he's known for a handgun hunter. He's one of the bigger handgun hunters. He made a bunch of custom calibers and all kinds of shit. But anyway, he used to organize what's called a Australia environment hunt. Look at this fucking scramble and these guys would go down and Doris please this, this one. Kangaroos on top. Keeps winning. Go Guard. Pull guard, pull guard, Bro. It's the blonde, the bonds of bitch. Oh Shit. He's got this book and he's got the hugs. The chuck. No hooks. He's gone. Marcella Garcia style concentrated firesides. I joke. Well Marcello concentrates in Thailand and shit. He doesn't even worry about the hooks is like, dude, I'll watch my UFC shows. Incredible. This is incredible. This is a battle.

Speaker 6:          01:26:56       Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:26:57       stop. This is crazy, right? It's got a good grip. It looks like he's got a gable grip.

Speaker 2:          01:27:05       Wow. He put them to sleep. Tapped him. Fuck you. He just tapped him. He let him go and he's just like hovering with his balls over that Kangaroos face. Wake up and go buy me a Starbucks is asleep. He choked up. Motherfucker to sleep. Correct. Not a choked him to death. Wake up and wants me to fuck your wife. Let's see if he wakes up. He doesn't have a wife fitting. Get married, Kangaroos, whatever. The kangaroos on the bottom, licking his balls. See, they looked up and he saw his balls. Kangaroo still pass the fuck out. Look over on the left. Well he, he just laying there. He's uh, he's submissive and this one's walking away nice and slowly on his tail. He's hurt. That tail is legit. Yeah. Well I think they duked it out for a long part of, for a long period of time before he eventually got the rear naked choke.

Speaker 2:          01:27:49       So the big ones, um, that are the red kangaroos and the, the Red Kangaroos is the largest of all kangaroos. The largest mammal to live in Australia and the largest angle marsupial. And it's found in mainland Australia avoiding only the more fertile areas in the south east coast and the northern rain forest. They're like, fuck you. We don't want your water. We don't want your fertility. The biggest they get, um, head to body length is 5.2 feet and then the tail and the legs and all that jazz. So would win the apparently getting toward chimpanzees or a kangaroo in one champ would kill everything. One chimp. Yeah, they're ruthless. Chimps are so God damn strong. I mean I'm sure Kangaroos are strong too, but I'm sure at shampoo just fucking grab its neck and tearing shit apart. Rip Its belly open. Shims can do shit with their bodies where they grab a branch and then launch themselves into the why.

Speaker 2:          01:28:46       Bang on that kind of strength is really hard for us to even wrap our fucking stupid heads around. Right. You know, how many chips can you think you can do? Me? Yeah. I probably couldn't do one for $1 million. A guy who's a really good chin up guy. Gangster 50 what is, yeah, 50 is just the crazy mother be like, I got to believe like, or there's like some, you know, ripped up crossfit chicks on there and it does it every day before breakfast and a good kid. World Record Chin ups. Let's find out. I'm guessing. I'm guessing it's 70 5:00 AM I the only one that thinks crossfits a cult. It is a call. You're not the only one. It is, and there's good things and bad things about cults. All right. A world record list. What is the world record? Two. Two, two, two, two. What is that? A raccoon. Oh Shit. Okay. The fuck is that? Yeah, it's erection. Okay. Here's the here. They're circling this motherfucker. You're dead

Speaker 2:          01:29:46       world records. He's punching it like, fuck you. Fuck you. Take that Jab. Is that a champion or a raccoon? I don't. Yeah. That's not even a big chance yet. Look at it. I saw you fuck all my car last night. What happened? That raccoon got into the uh, yeah. Oh look. That's a miss dude and coons are tough, man. Raccoons are tough. Champs or fucking or not like, oh, he's throwing, throw thought. Oh Shit. They're ruthless. They threw it off the top of a cluck. You let me throw you off this mountain. Yeah, they're ruthless. All right, here's the, they have most chin ups in a minute. Okay. Here's the world records for Chin ups the most, uh, the record holder is a guy from the Czech Republic. Of course, ready for this, or you're going to freak out. 232 pullups in 36 minutes. That's insane. In 2010.

Speaker 1:          01:30:37       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:30:37       And the Czech Republic, Jesus fucking Christ. Have you ever seen kipping pull ups but whatever. Have you ever seen the bartenders shit? The guys who do the Barre workouts look, yeah, I have seen that. It's always black guys. Look at that. Look at the Chin ups. Motherfuckers up though. This isn't say kipping Chin ups pull ups. What does it pull it? Chin up is when your palms are facing forward. It's none of those count. Jesus Christ. Those are insane. None of those kinds. This guy's still going. None of those kind of look, he doesn't even barely break his elbows. Well this is called his fucking head. Barely touch the bars. The bar crazy. He's you're kipping chin ups or kipping pull ups. I guess it's a pull up comments. Which ones a chin up and which one's a pull up? Pull up is like this, right pull is your palms forward, Chin ups. Is your palms outward, is that right? Is that it was one or the other. What's the difference between true Wikipedia son? What's the difference? That difference.

Speaker 1:          01:31:32       Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:31:34       I'm going to guess. Chin ups are probably the curl motion. Right. And uh, and pull up and pull ups are probably palms out. Okay. We're going to find out really quickly. I don't know because I do all, all look at this shit. I do all of them cause I'm sexy as fuck. I would love, I would love to be able to do this. That's a sane, just be fucking fat. Just to see the look on people's faces. I when millions, he's doing sideways ups on a bar where his body is sticking out like a flag. He's rushing. That's insane. Okay. Pullups means a proteinated overhand grip. So pull ups, his palms out, Chin ups, his palms, which is a soup unaided or underhanded grip. That's crazy. I've never seen it before. That's very interesting. Was this guy's going to do 62 in a minute and he's 50, he's 50.

Speaker 2:          01:32:25       Oh, dairy. Who is this fucking animal? You don't have low t. His wife doesn't want to fuck them. That's all that is. It's trying to like a truck. He's got a string of 19 year olds. Two, three, four, five, six those are legit. Yeah, those are wide grip. 10 1112 okay. We can keep counting and the people at home listening on iTunes or [inaudible], you're going to count to 100 you fuckhead. You're not even describing what's happening from 50 to 63 skip them pretty is. It is pretty amazing. 63 that's incredible. Who's The guy? What's his story in a minute? He likes palsy. Can't get any world records. Chin ups. Just say who it is. Does it say Stan apps that cough. Spell it. A p. S. E. L. O. F. F. I guarantee. I guarantee you he has Ohio.

Speaker 8:          01:33:19       That just goes to show you man, Ohio. Ohio is legit. Yeah. I always liked the Philippines of the United States. Is it really what way and pool? That was nasty. He's all of that was always nasty things. Said Ohio is the Philippines of the United States. If they're from Ohio and they've got it on a white tee shirt, they will gamble with you.

Speaker 2:          01:33:37       What is it about that?

Speaker 8:          01:33:38       The Midwest, I have so many gangster pool players because there's nothing else to do. Seriously. You don't got to work. What are you going to surf? Right. You know you gonna play volleyball, right? I mean fuck half the year's winner. So good luck trying to get lights on. Right? Exactly. So you go to the pool room, you play pool and there's the Midwest is full of them. There's gangsters throughout Kansas City, Missouri, Saint Louis, Shit like that. Fucking players. Why did they pick? Could take bar table though. Cause that's all they got. What's that about? That's a lot of it fixed. Well that's one of the tournaments are, but you could take some of those guys. Like I could go down through that part of the Midwest and take some people and run them up through New York City and just robbed the fucking northeast. Yes. When I say rob, it would be hard because you can't sneak up on anyone anymore.

Speaker 8:          01:34:26       Right? You can't outrun the Internet. I mean camera phones or camera phones ruin the road. Isn't that an interesting will the, the websites they'll like ac billiards did to a certain extent to too. It's not, but even before that, it's just, I guarantee you could show, you can take me to a pool room here in la today and there could be somebody in there and if it's a legitimate player, I could, if I don't know who they are, I could take their picture, send it to two or three people and probably take it everything there is to know about that within 10 minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:34:59       And that's without going to the Internet. That's just within that network and having the ability to take a photo and connect and tell them, here's what this guy looks like. This is a game he wants to play. What do you know about them? And you know, it's just, it's such a small world. It would be like you showing like a fighter that you knew was like a legit fighter. Well, just like when I, when I did that celebrity pool thing for Bravo and they were like, you know, hey, you know, we're going to put together a celebrity tournament and uh, we'll see, you know, like who can beat who out of the world of celebrities? Like good luck. You're all playing for second place. Sure. Absolutely. I'm like, I know you're all playing for second place. And they were like laughing at me. Like, how do you think you're going to win?

Speaker 2:          01:35:42       I'm like, I'm gonna win. I'm like, not only going to win, it's going to be easy. I'm going to show up high, I'm going to be highest two cookies. I'm like, there's no way they put in the time of effort that I put in. He just know very few celebrities. If they were as fucked up as I am, I would know about them. No, no. I wasn't here. The only people I've ever heard Paul Sorvino, which I think he's dead now. Jerry Orbach Sorvino or past right or bucket Jerry Orbach. Paul Sorvino, uh, David, uh, Brennan. What's his name? David Brenner. Brenner. Was he a player or was he just an investor? He's an investor. This is me running out like a fucking world champion right here, ladies and gentlemen with Max. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was, yeah, me and Max. I believe when I was taking us, I took a lot of lessons from Max Everly.

Speaker 2:          01:36:31       Powerful Max. Yeah. Max Happily went, that was back in his Vegan. I was responsible for getting them off that. See me now? Yeah. He eats everything now. Beautiful. He started eating fish. He started off with Sushi. How it starts. Yeah. It's how we all start. But Max changed my fundamentals and people think that pool was like a stupid game and it is kind of a stupid came. It's, it's, it's, I'm, I'm telling you stupid. If you're not a, uh, if you're not a player, I mean, if you're not, and I tell people this, it's like I do it for a living man. I mean, that's what I sell for a living is pool. But if you're not into it, if you don't understand it, you know, it's like me trying to watch golf. I don't play golf is a video of you and me plan? Yes. Somebody who ran the fuck out. You ran out. Yeah, there's a, yeah, I think it's just the best video is you do on the Earl though. Me laughing like a fucking retard over top of you. I was nervous when I met him that he was going to be mad at me, but he wasn't mad at me at all. He was a, he was. That was easy. Yeah. I mean arose.

Speaker 2:          01:37:36       I was a fan. Mosconi Cup is in Vegas this year. When is they make it? When is it? It's the first weekend in December. Let me see right now. Hold on a second. Are you broadcasting? No, we're doing well. Actually I can't spill any beans yet. We're trying. We're trying to, we're trying to do something before Moscone starts. I'm open that week, man. Maybe we should do something. It starts moaning. Mosconi Cup starts Monday. That'll be fun. Yeah. I would like to be there for that. I think that'd be fun. It's fun if you've never been to one. They are a blast. I mean we could do something because it's because it's like big money production. Yeah. It's like the only legit real television production in pool. We could do something with pool man. We can pull needs something. It needs something right now. Needs a little, a little juice, you know, I'll no ship.

Speaker 2:          01:38:22       If you and I got behind something, we could do something right now. We can make something fun. I think the only thing that has any shot to get mainstream acceptance of pool naked girls is that, or some kind of reality show or just a character study to where you like you picked the most fucked up. Follow around for six months. People would watch. I would watch that. Yeah. Well Earl is you, like you said earlier, seven miles in the morning, seven o'clock in the afternoon. 14 miles a day. He's a maniac. He probably stabbed you in the eye times before the filming is over, but Nah, he wouldn't ever stop me. Me and her would get along would be awesome if you could. If you could do something to where like you and Earl went on the road. Yeah. Oh my God. I mean row like when we were hanging out together talking like there was, even though I'd made fun of him, I know he got bummed out that I made fun of them, but I only made fun of them.

Speaker 2:          01:39:13       I do an impression because I'm a huge fan. Right. Email could you add impression was if you didn't know him, right? Yeah. So he knew that like when I started talking to him that I wasn't an asshole and then I, you know, I really said, I go, you're one of my favorite players of all time and that's a 100% legit. He w he and I wouldn't have a problem. He would be crazy. But I'm pretty easy man. You know? I know crazy. It's if someone was like, if like you a guy like you, yeah. All of a sudden became crazy. Sure. I'd be bummed out. I'd be like, damn, what the fuck happened him? Why do you go to stupid? Yeah. But if it's just a crazy dude being crazy, that's like asking water and not be wet, you know, it's like water is wet. It is, it is. What it is. Oh, here it is.

Speaker 5:          01:39:52       Are going to play pool if you're not properly equipped. Where's your 80% people quotes all the time. Everywhere I go, what are you doing? It might be it my grace impression of all time and it's super obscure this. Most people don't know where else strict on jump. Tusaro jump to jump with a fucking junkie. That ain't what the fuck is nice. He's got a tiny little shoes. Y'all pleased as punch. He's got a big smile on your face like you just did something. Get the fuck dad. Jump with a full table with a Meucci. Don't understand. After this, after this you have to Google Earl Strickland ranch. Oh really? Sounds like when the marijuana, I said a lot of my plans was marijuana. Earl got all paranoid. How's you know I do marijuana even said that. How's he know training? He was saying marijuana. Did you tell him I smoke marijuana? Well you guys talking about marijuana. Is it commonly known?

Speaker 2:          01:40:51       Earl smokes all the weed. Well, Mad Max,

Speaker 8:          01:40:54       I believe, told me and rob cy as told me, you know that the of their adventures together, the Earl Strip. Well look, a guy who's that good at pool. Why would he not fuck with marijuana? Marijuana makes if people who don't know, I know you don't like rock with it. It makes you very sensitive to movement. But the thing is he, that's probably the only thing he can do to keep his mind and this fucking atmosphere. Yeah, there's a little bit, man, he's Earl is people genius. He's, he says you cannot subpool genius. You can't take it away from him. He's a pool genius and like many people that are genius at something, the, as we said before, that genius comes out of a, a bit of madness and look at him. He's all pissed off. Well the Mosconi Cup is really interesting because it's like the UK or Europe versus the United States. All this is, that still blows up. I'll look at it as she's pretty, yeah, she is cool. An Earl gets crazy. Can I box out of everybody? He also puts weird shit on, like look at it, look at the eyes, look at the eyes.

Speaker 1:          01:42:02       They're all laughing.

Speaker 8:          01:42:04       He's so serious. He's like a character and character. He's a man. That shit man. He's like a comedian. But I mean he's serious about it. Yeah. It's like, that's one of the things I was talking to Jason Shaw about when he came down for our last match. Uh, you know, he said it amazed him. He stayed with her at all and he goes, Earl woke up in the morning talking about pool and when he went to sleep at night, he was still talking about pool. Yeah, he's Legit, you know. I mean, think about it. I mean, you don't, whenever we hang out it's like you don't talk about it. Yeah. You don't talk about UFC from the time we started at the time we end. No, you won't talk about comedy from the time we start to tell them we in. Yeah. You know, it's every hang out like a normal fucking person.

Speaker 8:          01:42:43       Well that's the thing about pool though. Pool requires that of you. Pool is like the craziest needy. His girlfriend in the history of the universe at a high level, it's sick. The bitch wants to see you all day every day you go to bed and then when you wake up, where are you? Right here, right me, wake up right and pool might wake you up in the middle of the night with a new move. Pull my weight. You don't have to get out that way. You know you play it like this. Then you play for the fourth ball. You're playing for the third row. If you play for the ankle on the fourth ball, then the, if you look the fifth balls on the rail, if the fifth Paul's on the round, you know, it depends on what I've seen. I've seen her. I'll do that after matches. He'll come in the next day and set it up and talk and talk about his shot.

Speaker 8:          01:43:22       That was in like the seventh game and it's like, yeah, it's like you go here. If I remember it was meaningless. Yeah. It would be like a football player talking about a fucking play that got two yards and the second quarter with 20 minutes to go. I mean it's, it's like something that means nothing and he talks about it like as a disastrous date that he just got home from right. Yeah. It's, I dunno man, those guys. And what's funny is most the players in the world have played for us on our, on our matches. Um, you can't name a pool player that's hasn't played for us. It's not top of the world. Top 10, 20 players in the world have all played in our matches at one time or another. And for the most part, the Americans are the craziest in general, like most mental about shit.

Speaker 8:          01:44:18       Um, the Filipinos are the most laid back, which is funny because they play like the Filipinos literally, if they win $1,000 here, it's like five or six grand back home. It's a huge amount of money. And maybe that's why they are laid back is because of whatever score they make here they is bigger back home. Whereas here, if an American player wins three or four grand, you know, if you tell any normal human being on earth that works for 15 or $20 an hour, you can make $3,000 in a weekend. There would be like fuck that's good money. But you know for someone who is at the top of their game, yeah it sucks and you would think they would make more. It sucks for a pro athlete and I split at the same time it comes and this is like, this is one of the battles I'm fighting is I tell people like, look man, if I could pay you guys 10 grand I would cause it makes everybody better but I can only pay you what people will pay. You know, cause I eat what I kill. I mean the way I do it is I've, there's no sponsors. There was nobody here giving me five or $10,000 to do a match. It doesn't work like that. It's Manny Pacquiao. What I take in on fucking paper view is what pays for all the freight. Dude.

Speaker 3:          01:45:44       That's the big pay per view. Me Versus Manny Pacquiao. That would be sick. Come on. So I think you'd be rob. I'd be robbed. He would rob me. Damn. From what I understand, I have to get in stroke. I have to get crazy. And you just have to outbox him. Yeah. Well according to Max Aberly Max, everybody says he plays it very good. Yeah. Max Planning to race a 10 and he only beat him like, I think he beat him six or seven to 10 right. Which if you know how good Max plays Max's mother fucking world class. But Amy's got a great reputation as a solid player. Yeah. He said, man, he gets out and being from the Philippines, it's like it plays all those killers every day. They call him the cow. Oh look at Max with the long hair and and go, wow, this is a Manny Pacquiao. If for first shot is not listening or listening and not watching, rather this is Manny Pacquiao, shooting some kind of crazy trick shot, which I don't know how to do one single looking at many packer.

Speaker 3:          01:46:36       I was a lefty too. That's interesting. That's worth a ball right there. Yeah. There's something about lefties, man, there's fucking shot. Dang man. He made it. I made all those balls. There's something about lefthanded people. This is an athletically lefthanded athletically. I believe that. I've seen pictures, quarterbacks. It's crazy. Yeah. I don't know what it is. I think it's a nonconformity thing. I think that lefthanded people have to figure things out for themselves and it makes you smarter because everybody else is going one way. You have everything else in the world is fucking opposite and from striking from a standpoint of striking, a lot of people have a hard time with people that fight in the south pole position with his right hand forward instead of left. Isn't that a big thing in boxing though? People who go, you switch. The good guys, the greatest ever at switching is Marvin Hagler.

Speaker 3:          01:47:27       Marvelous. Marvin Hagler was like, he would fuck guys up because you expect them to come out south and he would come out Orthodox and just put a beat on you because he could fight Orthodox as good as he could. Fight southpaw cause that very rare to, hey, very rare. So do you, what's the deal? Do you still think boxing is viable sport or is it just so fucking corrupt and fucked up that no, it's viable. Viable because there's awesome guys there that are excellent at it. You know there's like a lot of people like think that I don't like boxing because I got in an argument with some asshole on ESPN who was a boxing promoter and you know, I shouldn't call him an asshole. He's just defending his turf. And the whole reason why we even had this thing is cause ESPN was trying to set up this dispute between boxing and MMA.

Speaker 3:          01:48:08       Which one's better? And I was cool with it all until he was calling MMA like, like human cock fighting. Like they have this attitude that it's like some barbaric sport and I'm like, look, you're being stupid. Like you don't think it was 15 years ago. Well it's not only that, it's like boxing is a part of MMA. It's a key aspect of MMA. You don't have good boxing, you can't have them in that. It's like, but MMA, if you like, you get a boxer who's a really good boxer and that's all he trains his boxing and he gets in there with a guy who was an MMA fighter. He's fucked up. He's going to get his legs kicked. It's going to get kneed in the body and the clinch, he's going to get taken down a mountain. He's going to get smashed as strangled. That's just a fact.

Speaker 3:          01:48:48       It doesn't mean that boxing is an exciting and that I don't lock box, that I don't like boxing. I would've never said what I said. If that guy was in a deck, if that guy got on that ESPN interview with me and if he said that, I think mixed martial arts is a very exciting sport for some folks. They though they prefer just striking. I would've said absolutely. You know, there's something for everybody, some people for, for soccer. So I'm guys like baseball. You know, I, I, I'm a huge fan of striking. Striking is what I started out with. But boxing striking is even like if I was going to watch any fight, legit straight striking fight. I want to watch more Thai. Have you seen a glory? Glory is a, it's, it's debuting on a spike actually tomorrow, tonight or tomorrow. What's that? The 11th I think it's tomorrow.

Speaker 3:          01:49:32       Whatever the fuck it is. Glory is this new high level kickboxing event where they're taking the best kickboxers in the world. Most of them are European because like in Holland, kickboxing got fucking gigantic. It's huge. And his great fighters came from Han like Ramon Dekkers above Ernesto hoost. Rob came in like some of the greatest kickboxers of all time, all came from Holland for some strange reason. And then there's also this great guys that fight in all sorts of Delhi. Romania has a lot of great fighters like Daniel Gita. There's a lot of great and there's a lot of great American kickboxers that are coming up right now too. But when it comes to like pound for pound excitement, kickboxing is way more exciting than regular boxing to me. Sure has. His leg kicks and knees and head kicks. There's a lot of craziness. Now you're talking about because you were a traditional martial arts guy, so taekwondo when I first started, when you first started, but um, so now are those like tournaments, those sports obsolete, are they hurting for talent because everyone's going to MMA is money?

Speaker 3:          01:50:37       Well they also, they're going the, the big thing about martial arts, when I was a kid, when I was first starting out and I had to choose a martial art, it was always a very difficult to figure out what was the best martial art. And you had to kind of decide for yourself. You got to watch people and decide for yourself. And it was really hard to quantify. It was really hard to figure out what was the best. Then the ultimate fighting championship came along and now there's no question, now we know what you need in an all out fight and a mixed martial arts fight where essentially there's a limited set of rules. We know what you need to learn how to do and it's not taekwondo and it's not Moitai and it's not wrestling and it's not Jujitsu. It's all of them. And if you don't know how to do any of those aspects, if you're a really good wrestler, but the guy you're fighting knows how to defend the takedown and he could fuck you upstanding, you got a real problem.

Speaker 3:          01:51:27       And that's what a lot of wrestlers are dealing with today. They don't know how to strike and they face a guy who develops like Mirko Cro, cop and pride days had really good take down stuff and take down and then you walked with head kicks and there's nothing you can do about it and you get hit by that shit. You're going night night. So there's that. Then there's also these wrestlers that figuring out Jujitsu, they can take you down. It's strangle you, you've gotta be able to stuff that take down. If you can't stop that take down, they're gonna take you down every time. If you can, stuff that take down, but they can't stand up, you're going to fuck them up every time. There's a lot of variables and that's what we know now. We didn't know that when I was starting out, when I was starting out, it was no one knew what was the right way to do, whether it was it was boxing, but there was wrestling, whether it was taekwondo or karate or morning time.

Speaker 3:          01:52:09       No one knew. Do you think he meant may guys are wanting to like the second, third generation? I don't know how many generations. I don't know if there's a need to, to numerically ordered them. But I would say that today we have a much better sense of what is ultimately effective in martial arts than we did even a year ago. Just in the last couple of years, we've seen an increase in the number of traditional martial arts techniques. Front kick to the face and Anderson Silva landed on v tour. The wheel kicks that had been landed v toward landed a wheel kick. Um, uh, junior dos Santos knocked out Mark Hunt with a wheel kick. Edson Barboza knocked out Terry Adam, there's all these wheel kicks now that we haven't seen before. And those were always viable techniques in taekwondo and in a kickboxing Kyokushin, but we haven't seen them in MMA because the guys who are really good at them didn't fight MMA.

Speaker 3:          01:52:56       They fought kyokah should and they fought taekwondo, but now we're seeing these MMA guys realize, hey, this is a really tricky weapon that I can add to my arsenal. So the arsenal instead of being a hundred moves deep is now 200 moves. T there's not two 50 moves deep. There's a lot of new shit that people learning how to do that. This is the old techniques that everybody thought didn't work like you're starting to see acts kicks again. Guys are throwing it off shifts and Emma, yeah, rich Clemente through one the other day and Bella toward John Jones through one in the UFC, but they're still not at the level of the ax kicks of like a guy like Jersey long who was a Canadian MMA champion who was, it had this nasty ax kick. It was like getting hit in the head with a fucking baseball bat.

Speaker 3:          01:53:35       This mother fucker would just full split wing up and slam that heel down in your face and you would go to sleep. He knocked out a friend of mine out cold with an ax kick in a tournament that's his due date, Jersey long and it was so nasty. It was like getting hit by a sniper, the way the dude. And it made me change my whole ax kick game. I put way more credence into ax kicks. I didn't think that aks kicks could knock guys unconscious. I just thought it kick. It was like a flashy technique that you use. But I never saw anybody go to sleep till this guy named Jersey long fun. It was like 1980, probably two or something like that. And he fought my friend and acts, kicked him in the head and knocked him out cold. It was brutal. The way he did it too is so fast.

Speaker 3:          01:54:19       We just not, we're not seeing that speed of execution, that fluidity of motion, that economy of, of movement that a guy who's a really high level taekwondo guy has, uh, in that, in that, um, in MMA there's a guy named herb Perez. I saw him a knock out this dude I think the Tuesday and was not seem, I forgot the guy's last name, but the guy was a high level guy as well and herb knocked him out with the ax kick to the head right in front of me. I was like my first national tournament. Um, I had lost, I lost my first fight and uh, it was probably, I was probably like 18 or 19, and I remember watching this guy, her Perez knock this dude out with a fucking ax kicked of the head. Like as far as a way as you are standing on the sideline and I saw this, he'll land on this dude's head and I re that was one of the, one of the main moments in my life where I realized, Oh shit, like national champions can also get knocked the fuck out.

Speaker 3:          01:55:12       Right? Everybody can get knocked out. If you miss something. Yeah. If you zig when you should have zagged and someone kicks you in your face, you're going to go to sleep. And that's a technique like we haven't seen yet really effectively in MMA. Andy Hook used it in k one he used that. There was a, there's a few other guys, there's a couple of guys I've, I saw a Russian dude who throws a mean ass kickers fighting MMA in a, a small organization, but we haven't seen it in the UFC yet. Wasn't any going to do a fight with one of the guys? Yeah, yeah. They're going to do a grappling match. A rematch of the fight they had in 2000.

Speaker 8:          01:55:47       What's the name of that series? Cause I'll watch on metamorris watch some of that on Youtube.

Speaker 3:          01:55:51       Metamorris is a huge, huge grappling organization. They're putting together this really, like they had Hixon son Kron for [inaudible] who's a famous MMA fighter. Very good grappler from uh, Japan and uh, chronic guillotine dumb. And that was a really exciting match. And they've had some like real high level MMA fighters and Brazilian Jujitsu fighters. It's submission artists, California, one of the bigger communities for Brazilian Jujitsu, one of the biggest of the world, one of the biggest in the world. And there's so many Brazilian Jujitsu schools in southern California. It's almost like beyond recognition or beyond a comprehension. There's, there's a massive amount. There's so many high level guys here. Hickson's hear it. Well, his son Crohn is here now. Um, uh, John Jacques Machado is like one of the all time greats is here. If I here for doom is here and there's a lot of great MMA fighters.

Speaker 3:          01:56:41       Would also teach you to how Natto Baba Lou. So brawls here, you know, there's a million Alberto cranes here. This is, it goes on on a hoist. Grace, he's here. Henner grace. Who's he? He, Ron Gracie's here. Hell yeah. Horian uh, you know, is here that there's so many guys here. They just, they came from Brazil and they're like, there's those little kind of crazy, and there's a beach here too. Let's just fucking, let's just stop here in southern California. And then of course when Emma May start to explode, this was like the glamor market, right? You know, and there's a lot of money here and there's a lot of people here is a lot of people who want to learn Jujitsu. It's a good place to open up a school. But the biggest school in the country is a apparently Henzel Gracie school in Manhattan has a giant school, but people love that guy so much. Henzel Gracie was like one of the best personalities and mixed martial arts and a two period, just amazing, amazing guy. Like a really a fun guy to be around. Great sense of humor, great ego, great perspective. And because of that, he has like this fiercely loyal following and he's a huge, huge fucking, I could see that going completely crazy in a place like Manhattan. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's got a giant studio. I think he has hundreds of students in Manhattan, but Manhattan is stupid expensive.

Speaker 8:          01:57:57       That's what I mean. Could you imagine what a studio cost, but, but then again, I mean all your students would probably fucking millionaires. So what's the difference?

Speaker 3:          01:58:06       Well, I can't ask how many millionaires in Manhattan. There's a fuck load of millionaires in Manhattan. A lot of people in Manhattan also that it just like barely getting by like credit card and paying their rent. Yeah. Feeding themselves.

Speaker 8:          01:58:19       But I mean Manhattan, that's one thing. Like I you, we were there, we were to Amsterdam. Yeah. You know, you've got to Amsterdam billiards and it's, that's why I love, that's probably one of my favorite pool rooms on earth. Me Too, because it's just a legit, I mean it's a beautiful place. It's ran well. They take care of it. Clean, organized the, yeah. Nice little waiters and waitresses, you know, courteous to you and, but it, it's one of the few, you know, it's hard to explain, but you know, you go in there and you don't have the feeling a lot of pool rooms, especially in the Midwest, you walk in and you can almost taste the fucking desperation. You know what I'm talking about? I mean, it's like, it's just like the sign, the cigarette covered sign on the wall that says pool $2 for five hours.

Speaker 8:          01:59:13       Yeah. I mean, it's just like, oh, Jesus, you know? But to me like a room in Amsterdam that caters to executive plying to yes. And the people, it's somebody, like if I, if I had a date, I would take her to Amsterdam. Yeah. There's maybe two or three pool rooms in the country I would take a date to. Yeah. I love hard time outside of that, but I wouldn't take a date to hard times now. Sacramento or, uh, or Bellflower. I mean, a hard times. I love hard times for the history. Yeah. I mean, the history, if you know what the f you know, that's gotta be like probably Yankee Stadium, old Yankee stadium or Fenway park is to a baseball guy and it's still there. If you go there at any Sunday. Yes. If you know the history of it, it's, it's, um, it's cool. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:00:07       I mean, you can go in there and you can look at that table and know that, you know, it saves him morale is probably played on that table in 1986 or whenever the fuck he came there, which that's the name for. And Reyes who Efrin Ray was just considered in my opinion, the best player of all time. He's still alive. Still Plan. Um, and most humble, professional, nicest dude in the world. Who's done more things on a pool table than anyone else? I think we'll probably ever do you just use the backs? Well, what's amazing about a place like hard times, there's a guy like me could enter into a tournament and play. Like last time I played in a hard time tournament I played or necessarily demand gas. Right? Anessa Domingo's is as a high level pro guy for 20 years. Been a great player. Great Guy Too.

Speaker 8:          02:00:54       And his son Oscar Domingez a also high level pro. You could play against professionals like a regular guy on the weekend. That's a good thing and that's also a terrible thing in my opinion. What's a terrible aspect of it? Because there was no one's going to pay to watch if they can go pay $10 and play with them. Is that true though? Yes. I don't know if that's true. I think the real issue with watching the real issue was watching this, this is not enough people participating if I think this is true. Yeah, I agree with that. That I think there was an element of both, I think pools in art form that the only people that could appreciate it, that people that can do it. Sure what, but that's a lot of things and that's kind of where I've made my peace with the whole thing is like there's a lot of people in the industry that seem to think that there's this magic bullet.

Speaker 8:          02:01:43       You can shoot at it and mainstream approval will come and all of a sudden there'll be millions and millions of dollars flowing into the industry. I don't believe that because I can't think of anything else where that's ever happened. People always want to compare pool to poker, but it's completely not even the same thing. It's really thing about poker is they came out with that fucking camera that allows you to see what the person's hand was. Yes. So that person at home has an inside view and they get to see the drama of feel like God because you know, if you know, nobody else knows and you get to be smarter than the plas instantly. And here's the other thing about poker, and this is, you know, the reason of so many, if there was 5%, the amount of dead money suckers and pool is there is in poker, we'd all, I mean, I'd be driving a new car.

Speaker 8:          02:02:40       Well, the biggest suckers in pool are people came over from poker who don't have any appreciation for money because he used to gambling big money, but, and poker, you've got a built in reason for losing because you can make the dumbest, stupidest plays in the world and still feel okay because it wasn't your fault. You got sucked out on. Why did that? How, how's that donkey call my bet? Yup. You know, I've got, I mean you, if you listen to poker players talk, it's crazy. Yeah. No one else on earth can play poker except for that particular person. Well, there's sometimes you hear that from pool players that go, yeah, he got lucky. He ran for you seven to the eight. It bumps into the nine if you didn't bump it. And I a lot of crying from pool players, but nothing like poker. Right.

Speaker 8:          02:03:24       And the other thing is, the biggest thing with poker is Pittsburgh for example, I will never, ever, no matter what I do, no matter how much effort I put into it, ever when the u s open nine ball championship, I could play 15 hours a day for the rest of my life. I'll never win it. It would be like me saying, I'm going to win the heavyweight championship of the UFC. It's fucking impossible. It's not going to happen. But you could win the world series of poker. Yes, I have a legitimate shot just snapped. And I mean, I mean, I'm not saying, I'm not saying a legitimate shot. I'm saying it could happen. It's possible. It is possible. It's fucking impossible. You might as well say, I can win the UFC lightweight champion. You know, it's fucking impossible. Goal should be the wind, the women's world championship. We should put, that's your television show. That's your television dress. That's yourself. Okay. Would hate me though. They get mad at me. Joe Rogan takes on the world of women of low.dot, dot. In Pool Dot, dot, dot.

Speaker 8:          02:04:27       It'd be rude. No, I, I, I eventually want to do something with pool, some sort of a show. Figure out some sort. You know what I would really like to see you do if for no other reason than just pure self satisfaction is some kind of really cool documentary. Yeah, that'd be fun. Because one reason and it's not, and once again, man, I'm to the point, I'm just not a believer that pool is a crossover to mainstream, but as, but I don't think it has to, but it has twice, twice and two times because of the media will tossler color mine. But now, okay, I agree with you 100%. So look at those two instances. Yeah. Two Academy Award winning movies. Both those movies won Academy Awards. Pretty crazy. Yes. So both of those movies that, so basically in order to get mainstream acceptance, you have to have an academy award. Winning movie, Jesus Christ. Wrap your head around that one. But here's my point is the fact that you know what, it doesn't take that to improve things for pool and everything else. I mean if you just get, you know, 100,000 more people playing, which sounds like a lot, but that's shit. That's 200 people in every state.

Speaker 3:          02:05:43       Yeah, we just need an ambassador. Yeah, I'll take the reins. You could do that. I'll handle this pitch. You could do it by checking on women. Now they just got to divide us people off. It's weird too. Also, it's a, it's an interesting argument about the differences, differences between men and women that besides the cultural aspect of pool being more acceptable for men to play, there's actually a difference in the way men and women see three d geometry the way that may, the way men and women see a spacial distance and their, their, their, their, their understanding of space. It's different. It's really interesting because a women can get fantastic at pool. You know, there's gene Valukas who competed against men and jasmine ocean plays basically like, you know, Allison Fisher. Please.

Speaker 8:          02:06:29       I don't understand why. I mean if you look at it on paper, especially a game like straight pool, right, where it doesn't require the big break, there is no reason on earth that I can think of. I mean physically, mentally you can go into all that if you want to, but physically there's no reason at all that a man should be better than a woman.

Speaker 3:          02:06:51       That's true. But it also, it highlights the differences between the way men and women look at three d space. Okay. We apparently have a different need. There's, there's, there's different requirements for survival that a man had of developing to this point in 2013 from, you know, many, many thousands of years of evolution and women have, they've had a different need for fast twitch, muscle fiber, a different need for reaction time. It's one of the arguments against a male transvestite, a transsexual who used to be a male who became a woman fighting females is the reaction time. There's a weird reaction time difference for men and women. It's really significant. It's about 10% Oh shit. Yeah. It's pretty much across the board. So that's funny because yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:07:39       shooting, which you wouldn't think, I mean there's really no strength issue, right? But the women aren't, don't come close to the men.

Speaker 3:          02:07:49       Yeah. Well Northern Cheyenne Pool, what was the last time a woman won a world championship and pull the u s open and he knows that they don't win them. They don't win them. And there's an amazing, amazing, amazing women. But what they are is so incredibly exceptional that they stand out, but they still can't beat the best man. They still can't be changed. They still can't beat Bustamonte. No, there isn't. There isn't

Speaker 4:          02:08:09       different. And that's one of the things I like about what I do with the people I do it with is it's interesting and enjoyable to me to show, uh, the levels because they're, you know, like we've done matches to where guys play and you're sitting there and you're going, you know what, if this guy was playing Alex or shame, he'd get beat 160. Right? Maybe. Right? But at the same time, the guys playing great, right? Yo guys playing great runout pool. You'll not making mistakes, but it's like it makes it bad decision here or he does something to get out of line there and unless you really know what the hell you're just going on, it's hard to miss. But you know when you see, I don't know, it goes back to the excellence thing I was talking about, but like one of the things that I'm really happy, you know when what I do is said and done, whatever that is, 25 years from now, somewhere on youtube, someone will be able to flip on one of these videos and watch and see. You know, people always talk about how good and Keith McCready was on a bar table in 1984 you know what? Well people will be able to see how good chain was on a nine foot 10 ball table and 2006

Speaker 3:          02:09:37       or 2008 and 13 yeah. Right, exactly. Yeah. That's unfortunate aspect to some of the past players when they talk about it, like there's like some urban crane footage. We see him playing straight pool and you try to like put it together. Moscone there's a lot of footage in Moscone when he was really old, unfortunately. You know, like those, uh, those ABC wild world of sports events that they had, they used to play pool on ABC wide world cool ports. But there was four channels on television. Yeah. But it, this is even more impressive. That pool made it down to four channels. Well, because of the story and I really think that if pool has any shot at mainstream television, it is a reality show type. Totally didn't show you and May, dude, we're the last of the Mohicans.

Speaker 4:          02:10:20       You could absolutely. I think you

Speaker 3:          02:10:24       could do something. Yeah. You know what I could do? I could play really high level women and the action report match, you know what you could do is you could just could just make you into

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       like the ultimate asshole. No, you do it. It's just, I mean we could just make you the bad guy. I don't want to do that. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:10:40       that'd be better than the other way as I was nice. I just play really good women kicked her ass, cause I can't be in there, man. You can't. You

Speaker 2:          02:10:48       can't be to any really good women. None of them. I'm going to tell you five really good one and you got no shot to beat. Give me a year. Can't beat Allison. You can't be serious big. Can I get crazy guy young? You can't be all comedy knows. Y'All are saying just fucking nine ball and jasmine. None of them. I'm to bring somebody in. That can be all the rest of things. All the rest of them. A lot of how much of a drop off is there? Who I want to see you play? Who? Sarah rousy. She's a really good player. He's a very good plan. Okay, let's do it. Let's make it happen. I think Sarah would straight rob. You straight rob me. Someone's got to crush straight rod. Someone's got a crush her as much, so there's my buddy. If I start firing, man, we were in nom together, but no Sarah, she hasn't played pool and like for you to perfect.

Speaker 2:          02:11:36       That's what I'm looking for. Duck. Yeah. Listen man. I have gears and on my highest gear, I surprised myself, but at my lowest gear, I'm not very good at all. That's my real problem. You know, like remember what time you and I were in Vegas from playing Eric? Yeah. I couldn't miss the ball. She's running out packages over and over and over again, but that's rare. And then I have to get into the groove by playing like six. Okay, six, seven hours. I know exactly what the hell are you talking about. What do you think causes it?

Speaker 3:          02:12:04       Uh, you get loose, you understand exam. For me, it's a matter of pool is all, I mean I understand how the stroke the ball correctly. I understand how Stan correctly, I understand how to aim correctly, but unless I'm playing consistently and I have constant feedback loop between qtip hitting the cue ball, Cuba hitting the object ball and it goes into my calculator of what's going to happen, I can fuck up and I can over juice shots and I can have too much English. It's a matter of a massive amount of information coming at me over a long period of time. Six, seven hours of just playing pool know us eating pizza and fucking drinking coffee and then right back to the table. And when I do that, then especially that homeboys place where that intense pasta, what's that fucking best billiards in Vegas and amazing food that motherfucker has. I heard the kitchen closed down. It's not true for the herd. I haven't been there since last time we were there. How dare he closed down the kitchen. But when you do that for a long period of time, then I then I'm working with a massive amount of information and when I'm working with a massive amount of information about touch and feel and movement and I get a sense of what's going to happen, then I can get into it. And once I get in,

Speaker 2:          02:13:15       does it anything like his Jujitsu and very sad for you.

Speaker 3:          02:13:18       Very, very, very, very, very similar. It's all just a matter of feel and movement and, and knowing what the feedback loop is. Like if you've never punched somebody in the, your punch someone and you're like, whoa, this is crazy. But then if you punch him a meal, if you've used to punching people, it just comes out. It's just, it just feels normal when you're hitting someone. And I think with pool balls is the same thing. The more you stroke that ball, the more you understand the movement and the more it it, it's in my head exactly how much effort I have to exert to get exactly the same result on one ball and have balls twist and turn and move. And that's, that's the big thing. And for me also, I'm so busy that I don't get a chance to play that much. So when I do get a chance, like when you and I are in Vegas with Eric and we get like seven, eight hours and we're playing in a 24 hour pool hall, I'm an enthusiastic as fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:14:06       So like five, six hours into this, I haven't lost any enthusiasm. Sure. I'm the loving the shit out of this, but I'm also getting excited and then they start seeing Eric fall apart. When I started there, I shot it and like predatory instinct kicks in. And then I'm a sneaky feeling. You feel him with his cue. It's like you get any nuts shot in with your own cues sign. That's not good. It's right. I see you over there. No wobbling, wobbling in the back of the herd. I don't know man. There's very few things in life that I've had as much of an attachment with where I really like got a lot of satisfaction out of like pool. So for me it's just a, it's just fun. It's uh, and I'm not playing the person either. I'm just playing those balls. I'm just trying to do my best.

Speaker 3:          02:14:47       I'm trying to do my best to making my way around the table so I'm not upset if someone wins. You know, when I was a young man, if I was playing a game when I was an idiot, I would get upset if someone else one. And then I've realized somewhere along the line that doesn't help me in any way. And in fact it hurts me. But it's also got nothing to do with you. Exactly. Especially with pool pools. One of the rare games where like there's a famous match between Francisco boosted and Johnny Archer. They were playing a race at 10 for some incredible amount of money. Johnny Archer broken ran 10 racks in a row on him, which is insanity. And then at the end, Francisco Bustamonte want to double the bet and keep it going. Right. That's how crazy it is a fucking game is that a guy can do that with 10 games you don't even get a chance to shoot.

Speaker 4:          02:15:30       It's like the old joke about a guy, he makes a game with the guy, they're going to gamble and uh, the guy breaks and runs out the set. The other guy never gets the play and he comes up to him, he goes, hey man, you're going to have to spot me something cause spice. I kind of spot you something I haven't seen you play yet.

Speaker 3:          02:15:45       You know, so it's, well there's a thing about pool and this is the big one. Ended up with this. The thing about pool that separates us from video game, not necessarily video games, but really from poker is execution exactly as they occur. You have to make a decision pool, you have to make a decision and you have to execute it and you have to keep your nerves together. You know, if you've ever played in a tournament or you ever gambled, you know how hard it is to really shoot straight when your heart's pounding your chest and a bunch of people are watching you. Yeah. You know, which is why you see a guy like Shane or a guy like Alex or you know Earl when they're playing their very best against high level competition and then it ever fucking surrounded by people who know how to play pool. Yeah. Real pool players. Like I could run out a rack and get out and the average person is like, that's incredible. But you know someone like you is like, why don't you go that way on the sixth right. And like I fucked up man. I just got lucky. I pumped the eight and I got got clear. You will know that I fucked up. You will know that I got lucky and I got out still. That happens all the time. Whereas a guy like

Speaker 9:          02:16:53       she's fucking see that if he misses that five ball, he doesn't even get out if he doesn't clip the fire ball with his cue ball. He was playing luck. Pool playing wish pool. We wish. Wish you add a shot. Huh?

Speaker 3:          02:17:06       There was a dude named Tom, uh, um, uh, Mt. Vernon and Tommy and while we were at a time, it was like a, a top player, uh, back at executive billiards where I played in white plains, New York. And he would get mad at people when they play wishbone.

Speaker 8:          02:17:19       Wishful. He's over here playing some old wish pool, some old wish pool. You wish you got positioned?

Speaker 3:          02:17:27       I learned a lot, man. Hanging out in pool halls. I learned a lot of it.

Speaker 8:          02:17:30       I learned a lot about life. I really did. There's some extreme human beings. Yeah. And I'll tell you what it will, uh, you know, I've made my living in that world for the last, since 2007 and probably one of the

Speaker 3:          02:17:44       you guys outside of pool players that actually can make a good living.

Speaker 8:          02:17:48       It's not good. Yeah. You got to keep your place. I tell, I tell people, you know, it's like, I feel like from just the technical things I do, I could go make more money doing other things, but it's, I'm pretty confident in it. But one of the things that, and I tell players this and players have told me this, is that it's, it's, it's, it really means a lot to be able to control your own destiny kind of. And that, you know, if I wake up in the morning and I want to go do Xyz, I can do that with the knowledge that I also have to have this done by this time. It's like a lot of people who, who do their own freelance type of stuff. I mean, there's a lot of people out there who do that, but, uh, you know, you, you give up security for freedom and once you make that, I mean, dude, you are a fucking standup comic for how many years, if anyone on earth understands that it's you.

Speaker 8:          02:18:50       Yeah. You know, I mean, before you got your break, what were you making a night? You know, it wasn't very much. Right. But I mean it's, yeah, and there's, but that's the thing too is, you know, if you want to go work a nine to five job, you'll have a little more security. Not much in this day and age, who was even more drastic than comedy because, well, you can't go make money with comedy. At least, you know, if you go show up, you're probably going to get paid. Even if you suck with pool, you can go and you have to pay to go and pool. Yeah, no, you have to be a room. You have to pay for your tournament entry. And if you don't perform, you don't get fucking paid. So pool is double tough for players. It's very, very, very good.

Speaker 3:          02:19:37       Listen man, after this podcast is over, it's basically over. Now let's wrap this bitch up. Let's figure something out, man. Let's, you and me do something. Let's do something. We'll do it on the internet. We'll do it somewhere. It doesn't make something happen. See if we can see if we could do something. Just get a little fun in it.

We'll do something for sure. I just podcast had no beginning, no end. It has no end is a no point. But that's life.
