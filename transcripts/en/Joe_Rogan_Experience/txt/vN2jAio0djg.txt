Speaker 1:          00:00:00       We're, we're about as lucky as human beings ever get to be. Do, do, do, do, do I, we live body wise, we're live on podcast wise. Greg and I were just talking about Greg for people don't know Greg Fitzsimmons and I have been friends for like 28 years, 28 years to roll his fucking God damn fucked. We started out as raw open. Miker is almost exactly at the same time. Yeah, but I was dreaming about it since I was a kid. When did you, when did you think that it might be something you want to do? Because I was grabbing microphones when I was fucking eight telling jokes into them. No Shit. That's awesome. Oh Man. It wasn't until I was like 21, like right before I did it, like maybe 20 or 21 and one of the reasons for it is a, a guy still a good friend of mine.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       His name's Steve Graham. He was an ophthalmologist and he was this guy who was just this. He's such a fucking wild man. Like I've met some people that purport, they look sort of pretend to be wildman. This guy is the wildest dude I've ever met my life. Put a super smart, super nice guy. And he was on the US ski team. Okay. And when he described his key run that he did to make the team, he said like at any moment in time I would have crashed at any single, just like I barely hung on the whole way and had this ridiculous time that I could never do again. And he was like laughing about it. But dude had like, I'm gonna fuck this up Steve, you hear this? I think he had 25 knee surgeries on his knees. His knees were insane. Yeah. His knees got to the point where they had to resurface them.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       So the top of his knees, he doesn't have any cartilage anymore. So there's a steel cap that they put on the top of his knees and then there's like this artificial meniscus in there and it rolls up and down and he has like a very limited range of motion with his knees. He's in his man. I want to say he probably has 60. He's still spars all the time. He's almost legally blind, like he has to have, like he's been hitting the head so many times. He has to have these, uh, these things that go over his glasses so he could see better because he said a bunch of ice surgeries hitting the head from skiing, from sparring. He's still spars all the time. He's super fucking smart, but he doesn't care. Like he's like, he goes on my hair for a long time. Just here for a good time.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       He'll laugh at you. Like he used to be a flight surgeon. He's a fucking amnesty from a, I think he was originally from upstate New York. He's one of the very few people that told me a Ufo story and I had to go, whoa, because this dude just doesn't make shit up. And he's done everything maniac. When I met him, he was a learning taekwondo. Immediately became obsessed, want to start fighting immediately while he was a resident. Okay. It was going through his residency for ophthalmology, be sitting on the toilet. He told me sitting on the toilet, eating lunch, and as he fell asleep while I was taking a shit and his pager went off, will come up.

Speaker 2:          00:03:02       That's the guy you want to head to the operating room when you're laying on the table. He's a student guys. GotTa fucking Dukie and his cheeks. He has enough time to wipe it out. You were always on call. You're always working, man. I had two friends that went through the residency. My other friend was a Korean friend. His name was junk and junk. Sick. He actually won the nationals. He won the US national championship while he was in medical school. Taekwondo, yeah. Wow. He was a beast and he was never like a really physically talented guy. He was just unbelievably determined and super smart and not. It's not that he was physically inept, but he didn't have any amazing attributes like sign. Some fighters just have amazing physical attributes. Plus he could always. He could already count to 10 in Korean, so he was like ahead of the class.

Speaker 2:          00:03:49       He was also like super humble. It was really weird. I mean, you were talking about a dude who won the national championship and when you would ask him about it, he would always say, oh my God, I Suck a fucking terrible. I can't even believe that I win these fights. Like who would just joke around about it? How do people, I mean you're, I put you in this category is I'm amazed by some people's energy because I've always had, I think as I have depression, I have mild depression, medicated for it and my whole life I've struggled to manage my energy and to focus it and pick what I, what it is I need to accomplish and put my energy on that and let go of the things that keep it simple. Just keep it simple and I look at somebody like, you are talking about this guy and I mean you already did a three hour fucking podcast today.

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       You're sitting down with me. We're, we're seven minutes into another three hour podcasts. You probably already worked out today. No, I didn't. I think I had a food poisoning. Oh, right, right. I was telling you before, but it's just amazing to me how we're all built differently and when you gain, when you gauge success, it's like, you know, we all are dealing with a different tool belts. Some of us have this unlimited energy and focus. Some have adhd and somehow those things that fuck you up can make you stronger. Like I'm sure this things about you that are did maybe you didn't do well in school because of that made you successful in life. Yeah. Yeah. One hundred percent. Yeah. I'm, I'm not, I've never been a very disciplined person, believe it or not, but you've always had the energy. But I've always been driven, like I find things that obsess on and then it's not a discipline thing.

Speaker 2:          00:05:22       It's a matter of like almost like limiting my amount of time that I'm doing them. Like when I, like when I was doing taekwondo, when I was competing, who was never an issue of I got to be disciplined and show up to train. It was the opposite. It was like I was training all day. I was constantly training. I was obsessed, you know, so, but the problem is like if you say, hey, you have to go do your taxes, I'm like, oh my God, I can't do it. It's like if you told me that I had to be an accountant, I'm like, Oh my God, I'm too stupid. I can't do it. I just don't. I can't focus on anything I don't want to focus on. Getting a business manager was like the greatest thing that ever happened. That's huge. It's also like

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       picking something for a living that you actually enjoy doing. I think there's a lot of people that are tortured out there that really are supposed to be like a bike maker. They're supposed to make fucking motorcycles or something, but instead they got sucked into some insurance job and they don't give a fuck about it and they're just trying to sell policies and it's just a grind on your soul every day. You and I, that's what we talking about before the podcast, how lucky we are at all, all these years that we've known each other like we were fucking common. Yeah, this is what we always wanted, but we didn't even know we wanted this

Speaker 3:          00:06:29       and it's and when I go, like people say to me, I'll be out to dinner. It'll be like 10, 15 at night. I'm in Venice beach and with good friends and my wife having a nice meal, finishing up some Tiramisu, pay the bill. Oh my God. I'm tired. All right, we're going to go to bed. I'm like, yeah, I'm heading in Hollywood and do a spot and about 45 minutes they look at me like I'm fucking crazy. And they go, is it for the money? I go, no, I think I'm getting $15. Well, is it to get seen? I'm like, there hasn't been industry at the comedy store in about three decades doing it. Why you doing it? And I go, I got no fucking idea. I just need to do because I just, I fucking love it. And it's not. And it's like, and I've never too tired to go do a spot. I'll be too tired to write a SPEC script I was supposed to be working on or whatever. But when it comes time to fucking, I look at my, my, my phone and I go, oh fuck, I gotta I gotTa Ten 30 at the laugh factory. I'm like, I'm in the car. I got fucking classic rock plan. I'm ready to go.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       Right? Yeah. That makes sense, man. You know, after 28 years, how lucky are we? Stupid. Lucky. But that energy that you get out of like laughter people laughing at your ideas and, and orchestrating those ideas and getting them done and you know, dismounting strong. Thank you. Goodnight. Bring up the next guy. Especially the way we do it at the store when you're doing this 15 minute sets, it's fun. Math 15 is such a perfect amount of time working on some new shit. You do some shit, you know was going to work. Work at some new shit.

Speaker 3:          00:08:02       Yeah. Taking a little hand or gay hand grenade. You know you got. Yeah. I, I a bought a joke. Just bombed. Here's a little fucking little thing called winter jacket from 1987 back in the game.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       And also you get to see all these other people. You know. I think it's super important in this, in this climate right now. I'm sure you've been aware of all the Amy Schumer. Controversial al. Please look, jesus, we are, we are all influenced by each other, all of us. But it's a good thing. What's imPortant is just originality. It's very important. so what, like there's comics, like I know norton doesn't even like to watch people. I can't watch people. Yeah, he does, but I do, I do all the time. You don't watch people. Like if luke shows up, you don't watch them.

Speaker 3:          00:08:46       I'll watch a little bit and then I'll walk out. I tell I can't be anywhere near. Oh, he gets you with that cadence. My balls smell like a fart. So yeah. And that's how, that's how she ended up anyway, a couple of nuggets later. You know, it's like where do I don't say that, what the fuck. He's Just too and too strong. But um, if I'm working on the road, I'll watch both comics that the opener and the m and the feature act. I'll watch them, number one. so I don't do any of the same premises. And number two, I feel like I owe it to them because a lot of them will say, you know, I asked to work with you three months ago, it's like, it's a really big deal to them to work with headliners that they like, you know, and I think part of that is I have responsibility to watch their act and say, hey, great job or you know, hey, here you go.

Speaker 3:          00:09:40       You know what I mean? But like give them, give them some feedback and fuck man, I take numbers all the time. I'll get a guy's number if he's good. And then when I'm in, went in his neck of the woods and I'll call them up and I'll have a feature for me and in a club that's huge. That's giant when you're a young guy and somebody gives you that nod, like that. Yeah. First person I ever worked for was warren mcdonald. Yeah. Bill mcdonald's brother. Yeah. He played guitar. Great guy. George mcdonald's, mcdonald's bill, my brother bill to know george. It was, I think they had a bunch of kids in the family, but those were the two comedian george was the one. I'm sorry, George George was the one who used a. George is the one that used to host open mic night. First guy to ever Bring me on stage and an open mike night.

Speaker 3:          00:10:22       Super great guy. Greg. He was my roommate for a while. Is he really in New York? We lived on mulberry street together. Oh dude. I remember when you lived in little Italy. Yeah. I went to visit you up there once you have this cool fucking apartment, like right over an italian restaurant or something, and it was. It was above the raven night social club, which was john god, he's social club. Do you were in the hood when I went to visit you when I went up to your apartment. I'm like, dude, you're in the hood. Yeah, it was mulberry between prince and spring and it was like a, you know, wednesdays was, uh, was the night when the family would get together and god, his son was out front and all these limos would pull up and they double park and these guys in overcoats would go out and they'd go onto this little fucking club.

Speaker 3:          00:11:02       Oh my god. They'd Walk up and down the street because they, uh, the place was wiretapped the raven night social club was, um, where all the deals went down for the, there's the gambinos right, got it. Yeah. And so they started walking. They knew the place was wire tapped so they would walk down the street down mulberry street in groups and they talk. So the fbi started inserting, they would park cars on the street and they'd put wire taps in the hubcaps of the cars. Whoa. And they would pick up the conversation as they walked up and down the street. Yeah. And so we moved into this place and it was a tony and gladys. It was a six floor walk up. No fucking joke. And so if you're on the sixth floor, you have to carry your couch six while we didn't have to because we moved in and we took, they gave us what their part is, all italian couple and we move in and they uh, they had uh, it was an illegal sublet.

Speaker 3:          00:12:00       So we move in and they've got the fucking couches with the plastic on them and the little end tables. There's craIg's barrett is, that's my fucking apartment. What floor were you on? Sixth floor. Oh shit. Oh no, I guess it's five. Five floors. So you didn't have an elevator. You had to walk all the way out so fast and there was no buzzer. So you'd go out on the fire escape and throw the keys down below. That's hilarious. So someone would ring your doorbell. Yo. Hey, here's the key. You don't have to drop it on their head. Right? But how many times did the key like hit the ground? I think after a while it wouldn't be. You put it in a Sock dude be rolling up is the move. I love it. Yeah. And it's, we want to live there for like a day, let me tell you, it was, we move in and so we got all this plastic furniture and then uh, and it had a, the, the, the end table.

Speaker 3:          00:12:49       I open it up and there's um, shell casings, shell casings from a gun ho. And then there was a wire to do was uh, uh, a device to listen to record your phone conversations they'd left behind, like they were all somewhat in the mafia. They weren't necessarily getting paid, but like everybody was like running numbers with their friends and involved. And he goes, anybody ever bothers you? You let this guy is like 80 years old. You let me know, I'll take care of it. I know people, you know who I'm talking, I'm not going to say I'm talking about, but you know who I'm talking about. And so they got a condo around the corner because their son gregory was in construction and he bought them a condo cash. That was nice. And then we paid. We paid $700 a month in rent. Me and george together first of the month, walk around the corner to prince street, sit down with them, they'd make cappuccIno, give us ken ali's and I'd give them $500 cash and then tony would go iN the other room and I'd give gladys and other 200 because that was her bingo money because saint saint st anthony's on sullivan street had been on tuesday nights and then st patrick's on mulberry street had bingo on thursday nights.

Speaker 3:          00:13:59       Was that a deal that you all worked out together or do you just let us made the deal the deal, so to glass, tell you to keep it on the dl that she's getting the to. Tony had no idea. He told me don't need to know about my bingo money. I was so behind me to keep that secret. What? Gladys. I'll go to the grave with the secret yet. So they'd all play bingo and then they bet the numbers. There was a, there was a woman, gina, and she had these two little schnauzer dogs and she'd walk up and down mulberry street and people would stop and say hi to her. Like every half a block because she ran the numbers and you gave her 10 bucks and I don't know if you know how the numbers work, but they basically take the purse aqueduct every day you'd look in the New York post and it's, there's a purse that's like however much money was bet. Say It's, you know, 300,000 5:51 and the last three digits of the purse is

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       what the number is that one the day before. So you play three numbers for $10 and it pays w, w, w what would the odds be? Tend to 100 to one. I don't know what the odds are, but at this fucking old lady walking around, she'd go to the shark bar. People make bets with her. My grandmother went to jail for that. No shit. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. When we would go visit her in jersey, newark. Wow. We'd go visit her for six months. We'd be like, where's grandma? Oh, grandma's grandma's with your aunt. Your aunt in there too? No, no, no, no, no. She wasn't. And it was just, they were telling me that she was visiting my ai, so the, like on the street corner, running numbers, I don't know, the full extent the store would out shoot when she said um, and the, the, she wouldn't rat out the mob.

Speaker 4:          00:15:45       Right. And that's why they put her in the. Gave her the option to tell on whoever her boss was. Yeah. She was like, I'm fuck you. I'll do time. So she was in the pokey for six months I think, and she was knitting sweaters for the guards and shit. And she was my grandma. I mean she was a full on grandma at the time. She would make spaghetti. She'd make homemade pasta. Oh my god. It was incredible to this chapter. One of your memoir, right? They're homemade pasta was incredible. It was incredible. Oh, so good. Like you would never have anythIng like he goes, so like old country hardy mean she always made her own pasta. She first generation, fIrst generation. What's her last name? digerlando. Well that was my grandfather's last name. Her last name was spumoni, I believe it was damn bemoan bangalore. They were straight off the boat. They both came here as children.

Speaker 4:          00:16:37       Fuck that name up. Come on. That side of mY family, I don't really have that much contact with them. But um, my grandmother, she had an aneurysm. They gave her 72 hours to live and she lived for 12 years and my grandfather never, never ever. She was a mess. She got dementia from it. She was just gone. She was paralyzed. How jesus really, my grandfather had a totally take care of her 12 years. She was like, my grandfather had to take care of every single thing she did. He had a wiper. He had a clean her. He had to take care of her bedsores. Could she move? Barely make noises and stuff and sometimes. Oh dude, you don't know. So I, I lived with them for awhile when I moved from boston to New York, when I got signed by sussman and I got a manager, I was like, oh my god, I've got to move to New York.

Speaker 4:          00:17:25       I couldn't afford anything. I definitely couldn't afford to live anywhere. And so my grandfather said that I could stay with them for awhile. So newark in newark on north ninth street. It's the fucking the like. It's a bad neighborhood. Like my grandparents live in a bad neighborhood. Yeah, it was a good neighborhood at one point in time was an all italian neighborhood and you know, did a thing called blockbusting when they move in and say, hey, I'm black people moving into your neighborhood. You have to seLl now. Are you going to lose all your money? Right. Some people would just sell their houses left and right. And everybody moved down and it became a black neighborhood. But my grandfather was like, I like black people who gives a fuck get off my lawn. It's like it was his house. He was never getting rid of that house.

Speaker 4:          00:18:03       And my grandmother had this aneurysm and she lived and she lived in agony. And so when I was staying with them when I was, when I moved to New York and I didn't have an apartment for three months, I stayed with them and she would just moan, make these horrible bones and be like, god damn it. She realized what it's like when your body fails. You still alive for years and years. It was all my threshold for pull. The plug is really, really high. Low. It's low. Yeah. If I get anywhere near that state, take me out. You know, just died. The angel of death. Remember that guy? He worked in a nursing home and he killed 37 people over like three decades do. And he would, people that like your grandmother that we're suffering, he would just fucking take them out. If people knew and they started bringing them into that place, I would.

Speaker 4:          00:18:53       Well, the question is like, did he do it to people that weren't going to die? Oh yeah, absolutely. For a goof. I think in his mind he was doing it for a good reason. The angel in, you know, he was an angel, which I could see. I have my friend johnny come visit me. He came to visit me in New Jersey and we're hanging out. My grandfather just sitting around talking to them and old linoleum floor, you know, the whole house smells like boiled potatoes. Fuck fucking salami hanging around all over the place, like the whole deal. Always bought fresh bread every day. Walked down to the bakery, got the bread, came back, was lIke as a talent as occurrence and while we're hanging out there and my grandmother was just moaning in the other room and my grandpa, my friend john, he was like, holy shit. I was like, I told you. He was like, dude, that's negative. That's what he say to me. It was like, dude, he goes negative.

Speaker 4:          00:19:47       It is. It's like the opposite of a sound machine that cheers you up. Well, that's what he was. He was, he was my frIend. Johnny was brilliant, brilliant guy and just in a weird, crazy way. But um, he, he was like, dude, you don't want to be around that. Like this is negative for you. You can't fix it. Can't fix it. You gotta get outta here. Right? And I was like, you're right, your grandfather must have been fucking psyched that you're staying there for a little while. He was fOr awhile. You know, he liked it. He's. He was a great guy. He was just such a. The big thing around the family was always like, there was pride that he worked in a machine shop that made a part for the nuclear bomb and everybody would say, hey, you know what grandpa does, right? What grandpa did, he made something. He worked inside. He was like a form and after awhile worked in some sort of machine shop. You know what he does? He kills jabs. That's what he does. Fucking three times. They used his part. Boom, boom, boom. Yeah. There was like thing people would talk

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       about maybe three times to two pumps to two bumps too. Yeah. There was like a big source of pride. I reMember when I was a kid, I was like, wow, that's awesome. Pretty cool.

Speaker 3:          00:20:59       No, that I was in st louis, st louis. Now we're have. Forget we're in Missouri. Truman is buried, but they've got a, his, his library like his museum and there's a fucking monument to the bomb outfront jesus christ. like this fucking guy had the balls.

Speaker 1:          00:21:21       We played, um, oppenheimer in the last podcast with sam harris for dan harris from abc news. He had never heard that oppenheimer quote when he quotes the bhagavad gita after the bomb went off. Now what did he say? He says, behold, I am become death destroyer of worlds. It's so creepy when you hear oppenheimer say I play it, but we played it in the last podcast when people be like, what the fuck? Rogan, I'll play for you after it's over though. It'S creepy because you see his face like, this is the guy that made the fucking bomb. Yeah. ThAt's his reaction to read some sanskrit bhagavad gita quote about vishnu.

Speaker 3:          00:21:55       So where did that come from? Because usually it's like the christian, the christians that believe in the, uh, the second coming or into that kind of shit. But that eastern,

Speaker 1:          00:22:03       either I don't think of eastern religion is being like that. well, he was. Oppenheimer was a fucking phenomenally intelligent guy. he was really looking at sam microscopes or something. He created the nuclear bomb. I don't know what he did before that, but he was one of the main people. There's a team of people, obviously the manhattan project, but um, he, he was, uh, just a, a super genius guy that sam harris was saying, we need to double check if that's true. But sam harris was st last podcast that he taught himself sanskrit in three months, or was it dan harrison said that? I don't remember who said it is, but that's how, that's how, like what you were talking about earlier about energy, an energy. Think about how fucking stupid we are compared to that. Dude. There's levels to this thing. you know, like chrom alone is always going to be better at basketball than you and me. There's just no, there's no matter what we did. You got to want it more fitzsimmons. Yeah. There's, this is not fair. It's not fair to seven foot super athletes. It's just, it's not fair.

Speaker 3:          00:23:01       I know. It's like when I'm around people that have perfect memories, I feel so less than. And I have to remind myself, that's just the fucking machine that this dude was given. You know, some hot rod like patton oswald. There's somebody, he'll be on stage riffing. F goes from a fucking tom waits lyric into like a movie reference of judy garland, quote from the 19 four and you just sit in a gun like I have to look at a list to remember my act every night. Yeah. Mother fucker. He's a fucking genius. Verily that's amazing is not only does he have this photographic memory, but he distills thoughts in a very unique way. Like when he puts up, I don't read many people's twitters, but I read his and it's like, it's always on point and it's always different than what anybody else is thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       Did you see the tweet that he made? He made like the best tweet. Um, fuck. What was, what was it about? I got to remember this. And he's also got lImitless energy. Yeah. It was about someone showing up at someone's doorstep to. Oh, it was about jamie kilstein was about jamie kilstein showing up at milo yiannopoulos his house and cue the theme music to the odd couple, like he got kicked out of his, uh, his podcast. It's just his sense of humor, man. He, his, his premises, he'll take premises that I would have abandoned long ago and turned them into genius bits and stretch them out. Like I hear some of his stuff on go, wow. I just need to like, focus on topics more sometimes. Maybe instead of just looking for a strong topic, like any topic can be strong if you do it the right way. And he figured out, yeah. Have you ever heard his fucking bit? He does about taking his daughter to starbucks after she had seen the lion king and there's a black guy, an old old black guy with white hair and the daughter yells out, daddy, it's a monkey

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       and this is the way he describes the place. It's a coffee shop in silver lake. And he said, he said you could barely hear the nora jones album over the sound of people's eyes roll.

Speaker 3:          00:25:09       I think it's such a good,

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       it's written, it's a really funny bit about him, like just running out of there with his daughter and hashtag racist. It's really fucking funny. But tHat's, you know, he just

Speaker 3:          00:25:28       no writing jokes. I've been, I've been in a little bit of a slump lately. I think mostly because I'm putting another hour together so I've just been focused on taking the last two or three years material, transitioning it, tightening it up and so I haven't been writing new stuff and then when I go back to writing new stuff, I'm like, how does comedy work again? Yeah, I think it's okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:48       Cop out that we do when we're working on stuff that we don't do new stuff. New stuff. Yeah. You lose that muscle, whatever the fuck that weird muscle is.

Speaker 3:          00:25:56       I just forget like when you really. I mean if you really want to get into joke writing, Breaking it down. It's like what you said, do you take the low hanging fruit? You know, that there's always that thing that happens. You know, there's that moment where you go, oh, that's a fucking joke. You know? Like I, I just bid about my, I'm driving home, my wife, uh, my wIfe texts me what time I going to be home, so I write 6:00 and she says, will you bring home some eggs? So I wrote, sure. And then I wrote what are you wearing? And then I got a text back, my cleats in my soccer uniform and I realized my wife is driving, son has her phone and then I got a text right after that, why, what are you wearing? And I was just like, alrIght, I don't have to write anything there.

Speaker 3:          00:26:41       There's a fucking perfect is a funny bit. And then I realized like I didn't take that, I've been doing that bit for a year and I haven't pushed it. And like bill burr saw me do a bit one night and he's like, dude, what are you doing? You got fucking, you gotta fucking unbelievable premise. Say you gotta fuck it. And he, he, he like riffs like five other beats to the bit that I do now. And you just realized like, yeah, I'm not, I'm not fucking pushing it as far as I can push it. Do you think that's an energy thing? Like what you were talking about before? I think it's a confidence thing. I think it's having the confidence to say there's more to this, I'm capable of getting more out of this instead of just going like, okay, now let me quick get something else that's going to get an immediate laugh and jumped topics. Right, right, right. Which is a hallmark of someone who's inexperienced or working on completely new stuff. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:27:35       Yeah. When someone's inexperienced, like when you watch open microbes, it's like one of the biggest things that they do. And also conversely that the right way to use it. Uh, richard jenny, who's one of my all time favorites and stretching out stuff. Do you ever tell people about this? I've been telling them as comics, go download a big steaming pile of me. Yeah. The steamIng pile of me or a big steaming pile of me, whatever, whatever the name of it is. It's richard, jenny, one of richard jenny's last specials before he, um, unfortunately killed himself. But god damn. Is it good? Yeah. So good dude. I was on the highway coming home from the store on the highway. How ling laughing at this special. Yeah. And the only reason why I listened to it is, you know, that weird thing your phone does if you bluetooth your phone, your car. Sometimes on my car I'll just start playing random songs. Oh really? Just randomly. Yeah. I completely randomly like it just, it just starts playing like I don't even press play. I get the car, start the car and when I did it, there was a song, the song went off and then the next thing was a richard jeni bit and I was fucking house and it was so funny. Yeah, it was so fun.

Speaker 3:          00:28:40       And not only that you are losing a lot of it because seeing that guy live, he fucking glided around the stage. He physic because he was a little guy and so he appeared. You'd see him after a show and you'd be like, you're not the guy that the guy on stage was six foot one. You're, you're five foot Seven. And what happened to that other guy? Yeah, well he dId.

Speaker 1:          00:29:01       That's special with one of those mc hammer earpieces holidays. I'm a motivational speaker. Things right. He had one of those on or something. He had either that or a lav mic, but he didn't have a mic in his hand, which I'm always like, what are you, what are you transitioning away from being a stand up and now you're like, what is that?

Speaker 3:          00:29:18       He really uses his hands for most people you don't need that. But for him it was like, you know, he explored physically space. He accentuated punchlines with movement. Yeah. And, and I would watch him night after night sometimes, and if you, if he was saying the word glo his, he would, his weight would be on his left foot. His right finger would be in the Air and it'd be the same fucking way the next night.

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       It was like a ballet.

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       It was exact. He was my opinion the best at taking a premise and just ringing all the funny out of it and I remember watching him and one of the first things that I realized when I was watching it because I went to see him, I paid to see him before ever did stand up. And um, I remember thinking I actually sat in the front row. It's pretty bad ass at catch a rising star in cambridge. And I remember I saw also saw many killed there. I saw kevin, we were together that night. I saw him crushed there a couple of times, but I saw me and he crushed so hard. I went with my friend diane from high school. We were buddies and we went and it was like one of the few girlfriends that I had back then we were just buddies and she was like a really funny chick and we went to see kevin meaney and he fucking killed so hard that I walked out of there and pain, like my sides were her. Like people don't know how hard kevin meeney used to kill.

Speaker 5:          00:30:42       I would, I would put him against in terms of being in the right room on the right night. Nobody killed his heart as kevin media. He would fucking. You couldn't kill harder. You couldn't kill harder because he went up in this character that was a complete departure. It was a silly guy who was joyous and who didn't give a fuck what you thought. If a joke started bombing, he'd start saying, I don't care. I don't care. my jokes don't go over. I don't care. And then he start doing it like a dog. woof, woof, woof. He'd be bombing. The fucking crowd would not be laughing and he would string that out for like three minutes until all of a sudden they just started laughing at this insane man who was sweating and flopping around on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:31:24       Yeah. Well, when I saw him, there was no bombing at all. It was just destruction. It was when he had just done hbo and he was in that group. He was on fire. Dude, it's hard to describe because so much is lost when you see a guy like that on a big stage or on television. Yeah, you lose like being in the room with them. Absolutely. There was a hypnosis going on when he would crush. Yeah, so It was like him. I, I remember seeing him crush like that and going like god, like he was like so silly and it was so fun to get caught up in his silly. That was one thing that I saw closing with. We are the world, but you took it to another level because they had some fucking music and a funny song. Impressions within the song. He kept that bit too long.

Speaker 1:          00:32:10       Way too long now. That was his downfall. That was his downfall. Was he crushed for a decade? Five years? Yeah. Maybe it was only five years and then he just wouldn't take the material off. Yeah, well he went national and he had the ethic that the guys in boston had. That was the problem. The boston guys did didn't go national, but they all came up together and he was one of the top guys and they all came up doing the same act. They would tighten that fucking act. They would hammer down like a samurai sword and then they would, they would go all around town with that same act and they just did that. There was no social media. There was no one to complain, but I did a friends who would complain. They're like, jesus christ went to see fucking sweeney did the same goddamn act I saw last year.

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       Yeah, that's gonna. You know you're going to get a few of those this week. Yeah, probably. But meaning that he fucked up. But you were Steven Wright didn't fuck up. steven right left from that spot. Jay leno left from that spot and they did new stuff all a route. yeah. Yeah. He just got stuck, was crazy because I remember watching him not do well and one time he had to go on in miami after joey diaz and it was a disaster. Joey was yelling out punchlines and spanish and it was talking about sucking his dick and all the sudden he was sweating and people going crazy and it was just. They were just going fucking crazy because joey diaz in miami, in the cocaine days, he would kill like you, you never, you never seen anything like it before. There was no fucks left in his brain. And he was saying, shit, that was so ridiculous. We get all the fucks out. They were gone. He didn't give a fuck. He get, he had no fucks to give and he's onstage talking about slinging dick. And it just, it was, it was. So he was such a caricature and kevin had a really hard time and kevin had to go on after him and it was a disaster. A disaster. Kevin want to believing and

Speaker 2:          00:33:59       yeah, well he, you know, he had a lot of chapters to his life, you know, and then he, he had a really hard time for a long time and then he, then he ended up on broadway doing great with john pinette in hairspray and then that ended and uh, and he came out of the closet while he was on broadway, changed his life and he became a happier person. Lost weight. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Yeah. Fascinating man. Yeah. Fascinating. Different chapters of people's lives, but like who he was like when um, you know, when he went on after joey diaz in miami should never be confused wIth who

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       it was when I saw him in boston, a kia just, he hit a stride and he wasn't able to maintain it, but you can never forget how fucking good he was.

Speaker 2:          00:34:42       Is youtube is a tonight show. Appearance is because carson fucking loved him. Carson, they would cut away to carson. He didn't have his head on his desk, pounding it with his fist wiping tears. I mean he, he, and nile and it was just, it was so bIg you couldn't follow it. And so he got his break with that show, which was, I blame his representation. He should have never done uncle buck. It was the wrong fucking show for him and it. And it was so high profile and he was so big that when it failed, it really crushed him for a long time. Comics would just extend up. Yeah. Whenever we do other shifts, ones up kid in the way. Right, right. Louis, he had a great fucking statement the other night. He and I were talking backstage is about gone. He said it doesn't do anything but stand up anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:35:29       He said, to be your best you have to do. Just stand up. He goes, you can be really good and do other stuff, but like you know when you're doing this tv show and all jazz, he's like to be your best, you have to just do stand up so he's not going to do tv for awhile. I don't know man. I mean he could do whatever the fuck you want, but one of the things he said, he's like, I can be happy doing this forever. God, it's inspiring. You mean getting on a private jet and go into that because you sent out one tweet tweet anymore. He deleted his twitter. I think the cla, all the theater just tweet, like ticketmaster sends out a tweet and it fucking sells out, but how smart is that that he recognizes he's at that stage. Just steps away from.

Speaker 2:          00:36:09       But it also takes. I mean you have to have like I think some people need to spend a lot of plates. Like I, I can't just do standup because I start to, it's not so much bored, but I just feel like I got to do with the shit I get claustrophobic. yeah. And I just, I need to go. Like I, like right now I'm writing on a show and I'm fucking loving it. And I'm taking you run on a pizza right on pete holmes show. Chris was talking about before. Pete holmes is such a good guy. He's a good dude. He is. And he's um, he's a nice guy. He's good in the room too. I mean we're coming up with show ideas and like, you know, there's like seven or eight writers pitch and shit and they're all talented writers. Um, and then he'll just go like, um, he is the best way of saying no.

Speaker 2:          00:36:50       It's very hard to write a room to run a room and not make people feel like they're not heard or they're being rejected and he's got this energy that's just like, yeah, that's funny. And what if we did this? And you sorta like, he moves on in a way that, you know, the idea is not getting used but it might have triggered something else in him and we ended up with these episodes that are just fucking linear and they're there things that he signed off on and a lot of times you get somebody running a writer's room and they, they get codependent so they'll put shit the script that they don't even believe in and between him and judge, judge in the room a lot between the two of them in the room. We got fucking, we got episodes locked down alreadY. That's awesome. Yeah, there is that weird dynamic between showrunners and and comics and actors.

Speaker 2:          00:37:37       And it's such a struggle that everyone gets, wants to get their greasy fingers on it, especially in the beginning or at the beginning of the shows create like once you get to like some simpsons level or it's just like it's just a smooth machine. Just they know what the fuck to do. Leave hIm alone. Leave most, stay away from the south park guys. Just get the fuck out of the way. You know, don't, don't get your greasy fingers in it. Now if it's a brand new show and also being an hbo show, they just give you the keys to go. All right, do it lock up when you're done. There's no, there's no. I mean I wasn't there the first season, but I heard there was very little notes from hbo. That's what netflix is kind of doing to netflix. Doesn't have any notes why the fucking shows are good.

Speaker 2:          00:38:16       No, I mean, look, look at these network multi cameras, sitcoms. It's like, do you ever see the clip where they take the laugh track out of big bang theory? I have seen that. Terrific. But you know what that is? That's pickups. A lot of it. What do you mean? You know what pickups are like? You shoot a scene and then they have to change a line or they want to do something different and they do pick up some episode of big bang theory that aired and then they sucked out the laugh track. So you're seeing these negative. Definitely. Oh, you're seeing silence where normally you would be laughing in theory if it was funny, but they just insert laughs and so I guess people at home laugh at the same time because they're triggered to. Well, it's might be very. Yeah, that's a soundtrack. Probably a laugh track rather.

Speaker 2:          00:39:04       The laugh track is. Yeah, it's like some kind of uh, we did shows, I think there were, they do, we didn't even know what audience and they just, they did a laugh track on news radio. Oh yeah, you guys did it. We did a couple shows that were like completely ridiculous. I can't remember if they used to laugh track or if they showed it to people. I think it's some of them they showed it to people. I feel like in at least one or two scenes or mother had a laugh track, but we did a few episodes that were like super bizarre. Like one of them was in space, so the whole episode took place in space, like just news radio in space. No explanation whatsoever. A space suit on like the whole thing. It's fucking ridiculous. And that deep into season six, I think, I don't remember what season, we only dId five seasons, but another one we did a titanic episode.

Speaker 2:          00:39:44       We will do one ridiculous episode every now and again. The titanic episode. We literally had a fill the setup with water. So in the titanic episode mark sloshing through water up to my waist. It's freezing or it's fucking cold man, because like you think of water that you climb into like unless you're outside and this is a summer, it's 100 degrees out there was going to be fucking cold and you can only stand it for so long before you start shivering. So you're walking through the. They, they, they turned a set. He'll fucking swimming pool. So ridiculous. That's hilarious. Just paul simms as a genius. Yeah, It was just a mad man. You know, we should do one night just as an experiment is set ups a couple speakers in the back of the room at the comedy store and do a laugh track during our set and see if it makes the audience just fucking go into a frenzy.

Speaker 2:          00:40:33       Would you think that it wouldn't know something's amiss? That would really be funny. You write a bunch of shit that's purposely not funny and have some ridiculous soundtrack. See how people reacted that way. There'll be a fascinating experience experiment. Rather if you did something super offensive, you know, you talked about something like super super offensive. Yeah, and you did it all under hidden cameras and you just see if people laughed at something that's like really fucked up and then interview them after the show. Why were you laughing at that? You know, like isn't that like the always supposed to be the knock on shit? Like when people talk about rape culture, they're always supposed to say that you know, some guys on stage and he's talking about rape and everybody's cheering and laughing like that fucking never happens. That never happens. Like if you go on stage and you have a joke about rape, god damn that joke better be funny. Yeah, it better be so god damn funny if you're going to pull off a rape joke. Oh, you saying people clapping on the wrong side of it. WhAt I'm saying is do a joke that is purposely offensive, really

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       bad, but do it on purpose. Let everybody know, don't let the audience know, do It in front of the audience and have a ridiculous soundtrack in the back of the room, which is roars, laughter, and have people around going, what the fuck she's talking about raping kids and have cameras set up to capture the audience's reaction and then put it on. Put it on youtube and interview them afterwards. Ask them like if they sign a release, I have to sound fucking releasing. what were you thinking? How would you go? Like, are you freaking out that people were laughing? Like, I don't know. I just started laughing. Yeah, couldn't. I was compelled. What else is laughing? That's what happens, right? People are laughing. He around you. You start laughing more. Uh, yeah. I mean that is, that's part of the reason why club is so good because they're all like jammed in together like that.

Speaker 3:          00:42:18       Yeah. No, it's a weird. It's a very weird phenomenon when. Because there's always the guy that goes, I should be a comedian because at my office everybody tells me I'm like the funniest guy, and it's like, well then you know what? You'd probably be a good comedian because it's easier on stage in a way. If it's a good crowd and you go up there, you've got 100 people facIng you drinking that has the here's the, here's the drill. You pay, you pay money and you laugh. Not you might cry, you might, whatever. No, there's an agenda. You're going to laugh, so if you get up there and you do things that are in the realm of funny, you're going to get the benefit of the doubt more so than if you walked onto a subway platform and started tellIng a bunch of rush hour commuters. The same fucking material.

Speaker 4:          00:43:05       Yeah. Or your friends that don't want to hear you talk over them. The worst thing is watching one guy go on a rant that might be funny and the other guy starts talking over it and you're like, oh no. Yeah, no. That that guy's going through right now. The ranter when he's like in the groove and the other guys were. I go to a furniture designer too, and just shits on his rent. When you see guys at a bar and what they want, guys just starts talking over the other guy, the lift on their toes and get louder and louder.

Speaker 3:          00:43:38       Yeah, because there's a chick there and they're trying to score. That's the worst. Did you ever have a friend that would insult you and girls were around? Oh yeah. I had a friend fucking knock me down once we punch. Well, there was an ice, there was a lake near my house growing up and we used to skate there. it was fucking unbelievable. I grew up in tarrytown, New York, and we had this reservoir that actually feeds New York city. It's like the main reservoir for the water drinking water in New York city. And so, um, it would freeze in the winter and then they had this shack, this big fucking wooden shack twice the size of this room and it had benches and it had a little snack bar, hot chocolate and hot dogs. Then you go outside and there's like a wooden wooden steps going down into the lake with telephone poles.

Speaker 3:          00:44:21       They put it, and this is a big fucking leg telephone poles around half the circumference of the, the, uh, the perimeter of the lake with spotlights and radio, and they would crank fucking pop music and you'd go out there until 11:00 at night. We'd hide six packs in The snow on the banks of the lake. We go out there, we're in seventh and eighth grade drinking a couple beers, hitting on chicks. And so I'm out there one night and then during the day we play hockey all fucking day. They had metal nets they would put out and they would use a plow to plow the snow to make rinks out of the fucking snow on the ice. Whoa. It was insane. And this was before global warming. That shit froze by christmas and we were skating in march every fucking year. March, early march. How do you know when to stop?

Speaker 3:          00:45:10       Well, it's three feet thick plate. How do you know when it's not three days? They tell you the town tests it. There's a big visit, another shack on top of the hill where they have spotters. There's guys that are ringing, you know, guys skating with jackets that are the rink guys. And um, so, so anyway, I'm there and I'm talking to this chick from the next town over. So olin was her name. I remember this deep voice. Brown eyes were real fucking italian girl. That was my type little plump italian and I'm talking to her and all the sudden I get fucking knocked down. This kid, chris spencer had skated towards me and just checked me just fucking. And I fell down, hit my head, couldn't get up for a little bit. And I was like, what? The. And my friends were laughing. It's like, what the fuck was that? Chris was like trying to break into our little circle of friends and he was this big dude and he lifted weights and that was his way of like getting into the group was too fucking knock me down. When I was talking to colin and I tried to fight him later after when I had my sneakers on and thankfully somebody broke it up, he would've fucking killed me, but I'm cut to. Oh, insulin liked me at the time. Cut to a.

Speaker 3:          00:46:30       What was it, a halloween the following year we're running around and somebody sprayed shaving cream in my eyes and so I chased him down and it was somebody dressed as a bum, knock them down, sitting on top of him, punching him in the face. People start grabbing me screaming, dude, it's a girl.

Speaker 3:          00:46:51       So I fucking runaway. Turns out. Oh no. Guess what? Guess we had a big crush on me. Now her after you beat her ass, tell me about her fucking childhood. Whoa. Really? Yeah. So what happened? Did you have to apologize now? I. She was in the next town so I didn't really. I just ducked out of center. how many times you hit her? I think a few times. She's a girl. WhY did she spray you in the face? Does she know? It was, you know, he used to run around with. We would take shaving cream and we put aerosol tops on a shave down barbasol can and we'd spray each other. You know, when you came

Speaker 5:          00:47:29       home you were covered. You were a snowman when you came home and we'd have eggs and we slap each other in the Forehead with an egg and we'd run around. There's always one asshole had nair and then you'd have to go home early because he sPrayed fucking nair on your head. so she, she sprayed shaving cream In my eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:47:45       Couldn't see that. Well wow. And I, uh, knocked around a little bit. My first domestic abuse charge her go punch me on the bus once really was like weird thing, man. When I was 14 I got on the bus for a, for 13 year olds, like the junior high school bus. And there was this guy who actually became a buddy of mine later. He was young back then, mugsy malone and shut the fuck up. Just a tiny little dude at the time he was, I think he's two years younger than me. And anyway, some girl was mad at me for something. I don't remember what happened, but she started throwing punches at me and I'm like, what the fuck? And I block her punches and then I, I looked down and the dude was right behind her and then he said something to someone else, said something to him and he looked at me and goes, yeah, I ain't afraid of you either.

Speaker 1:          00:48:43       And I was like, all right. I'm just, what the fuck ever, man. It's like, can I fight this girl before I fight you mosey wills? It's just fucked up. I was new to the town and I don't know what happened when she was mad at me for, but I remember blocking punches by some girls trying to beat my ass. The fuck are you doing? And this little dude mad at me too. But bugsy malone, who is he wearing? A little newsy cap from the 19 forties. I'm super lucky. I never hit that girl back because it turned out she wound up dating my friend mark who a captain of the wrestling team like afterWards, like after this and he would have killed me. He was an aniMal and he was a couple years old and I was like, I was 14, he was 17, he was a senior and he was like one of the best wrestlers in the state.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       He was an animal. He smoke cigarettes in between wrestling practice. He would be in wrestling practice and that girl that tried to beat my ass, she would. She would open up the door and he would go outside and it was wintertime out and he would take a couple of drags of a cigarette. ReallY? Yeah. Yeah. While he was wrestling like at a really high level, he was smoking cigarettes. Yeah. He was like a, a thug slash athlete. Interesting. Like legitimate Bad motherfucker like animal. It was an animal wrestler Made me realize like real early on, like wrestling practice maDe me realize like how hard some people work out. I had no idea how hard some people work out. Yeah, because I had taken like karate classes before and I had played baseball, but I never did anything like wrestling in my first days of rest in class. I remember thinking, what the fuck you guys worked this hard. We have to go upstairs with to carry someone on our back and climb up stadium stairs. What the fuck are you talking about? Like why? What we're doing what we're doing. Endless drills were fireman carrying each other back and forth across the fucking gym, racing each other and constant live drills with wrestling. I would leave there. I could barelY walk. I was so tired. I didn't. I didn't do any homework while I was wrestling and I just want up doing no homework ever.

Speaker 3:          00:50:42       THat's true. With wrestling you. It really fucks up your grades. You come home, annihilate, violated your hungry. But I just want to sleep. And then did you have to try to lose weight from her?

Speaker 1:          00:50:55       I did, but I wound up stopping doing it because my friend steven was wrestling at 128 pounds and he was a better wrestler than me so I went up to 1:34, which is basically like what I weighed when I was 14 or 15, whatever it was. So it was pretty easy. I didn't have to cut any weiGht at all, but then I cut weight for taekwondo when I stopped wrestling and then I started fiGhting and taekwondo. I cut a lot of weight up until I was 17 and then when I was 17 I was still trying to make 140 pounds, but I'd be walking around at like 1:50 something and I would just starve myself and dehydrate myself was terrible, really fucked with my performance and then I stopped doing it. I went up to 1:54 and when I went up to 1:54, I became way better.

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       That was when I Got better. I was holding myself back by the dieting and I think that that's a big factor with wrestlers, but one thing we wrestlers is that their Mental toughness, because of that weight cutting, it's almost worth it because the mental. It's super bad for your health to cut a lot of weight, but those guys who could do it and still compete, they have the ability to push through discomfort and just have a drive to win. At. Very few sports can match because very few sports, where will the athlete compete in a state of like uncomfort as much as wrestlers? They're just dieting, starving theMselves, dehydrating themselves and still going out there like fucking savages. So it's just a different kind of sport man. Different sport. But anyway, that girl basically beat my ass. I mean she didn't really beat my ass, but she was younger than you. I think she was my age. She was on the bus too. She was taking the bus back, but I was thinking I'd better not punched this girl. Oh my god. I'm so glad I didn't. I got smacked by a gay kid in eighth grade. Oh shit. You got pimp slapped.

Speaker 3:          00:52:36       Pinch this, this black kid, keith. He was really a feminist and so he used to tease him. yeah. I'm not proud of it. but like at that age he just kinda did. It was like, you know, I'm embarrassed by it. Like we, you know, I used to whatever, you know, cock your wrist and say shit. And he turned around a fucking, smacked me across the face and I, and he, and he stunned me. I was like, holy shit. And uh, I didn't know what to do because he was, he was part of a family that was, there was projects and tarrytown and there were cousins and there were families that had a lot of cousins and his, his cousins were some bad ass motherfuckers. The davis's. Oh no. And so, uh, this isn't to say I necessarily would have hit him after that for a number of reasons, one of which I was not that touGh.

Speaker 3:          00:53:23       I was pretty tough with girls, but, um, but I think I was just so shocked. Did you know that you deserved it? Do, do you have a feeling I deserved. I got hit a lot as a kid and I deserved it most of the time. I got punched in the face in time square when I was about 14 drinking southern comfort. I walked past some guy who was like some fucking homeless drug addict who was like coughing up a louis. And so I started coughing really hard to making fun of him. He came back and punched me right in the face. You don't want to get beat up by a junkie. We know you're not in the days of aids. Oh, that's rIght. It was. Could have been an aids he punched now. I used to get smacked around. I was. I was such a fucking asshole. I was such a wise ass cause I was the smallest kid. So that was how I fit in. I was the funny guy who made fun of everybody. I would pick fights because then my friends would, would fight the fights. I was that guy.

Speaker 4:          00:54:18       Well certain things that kids like when they're growing up and one of the big ones,

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       just things happening. We like action. Like something happened. If fitz, he's going to go fuck with that guy, but I'm going to kick his ass because we're bored. We had no fucking internet phones. We stood on a street corner for five hours. That was saturday night. My friend kenny.

Speaker 4:          00:54:39       We'll just start fights with people who would just go find someone like a bus stop and just start beating him.

Speaker 3:          00:54:43       No shit. Come on. We're fighting. Yeah, it was crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:54:48       Yeah, watch them fight. I watched him get his ass kicked. He did it once with this guy and the guy knew how to fight. Guy was beating his ass.

Speaker 3:          00:54:54       Good. What's the kids name?

Speaker 4:          00:54:57       Kenny. What was his deal? He was just nuts. He was older than us. He was like one, one or two years older than him. They guy? Nope. Nope, not particularly big. Just fucking tough as nails. He had a boxing tattoo on his arm. Like I think he had a tasmanian devil with boxing gloves on. They didn't really box. Yeah, it was just one of those things like never made it to an actual gym like maybe a couple of times, but we just start fights and wasn't really that good at it. Yeah, it was. It was just crazy. He just, he was crazy and he wanted to fight and he realized that with his limited mentality and view of the world that the most fun that he had was when he was fiGhting. So it was like, well that means we fight until he just would want to fight all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:55:37       Like one time my dog got hit by a car. It was really sad, man. I lived on a busy street and my dog opened the door and she gets super excited to go for a walk and she didn't ever on a leash and she ran out into the street. I just didn't anticipate or running. She's usually pretty good about it. And she ran out and she got nailed by a car. Geez. Oh, so sad. She died right in front of me. I carried her back into the house and she shit herself. Like that's when I knew something I didn't, I still didn't know something was wrong, but looking back I would've known she just shit all over the kitchen and I was like, I can't believe she shit herself. Like what? Like why she never sits in the house. And um, then she just slowly slipped away, just lie down and I'm just stopped breathinG. Man just bled blood from the inside bleeding. She Got

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       hit by a volkswagen bug kind of dog. She was a mix. She was boxer and I think she had some german shepherd in her too. Sweet dog. Sad shit man. Who's sad? Shit. It was a real bummer man. It was a real bummer. But anyway, uh, I told kenny I'd never had it. I mean I'd had dogs die. we had a dog that we adopted. It had distemper when one up having to put it to sleep, start going crazy. It was an adult dog, not Adult, but it was over a year old and a, it was a doberman and it just started barking at us and smiling. It's its teeth and it just started losinG its mind and we got it calmed down enough. We'd get a leash on it and brought it to a vet and the vet said it had to stamp her. We had to put it down.

Speaker 1:          00:57:09       So I had had that happen before, but I've never, never seen a dog die in front of me. Sad shit. So I tell kenny, he's like, we're fighting. That's it. Come on out with fighting rogan. You'll fucking fight no excuses tonight. And we drove around and he like wanted me to pick fights with people. I'm like, dude, am not fucking fighting anybody. That's the way he would deal with his emotions. Yeah, pretty sure. Sadness, fight, anger, fight. Looking for excitement, fight. It's an end. It's also, there's a thing about, um, young guys were young guys always want to be the crazy one. Like, oh, mike's the fucking craziest. Mike's fucking crazy, michael, and give a fuck. And it becomes like a social status among young. Especially. We were talking about this beFore the podcast. Everybody, our age was like a latchkey kid. Everybody our age had a mom and a dad that worked and they open the fucking door in the morning and you were off to the races.

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       You went school afterschool. They weren't home for hours, right? You did a bunch of shit by yourself. Most of the time we're around other fucking savages our age. So it's the abstract influence of the parents on the children. That is really like giving you your experience for who you are as a young person. Yeah. You're, you're, you're experiencing how these people taught their kids and what the result was because you're around the kids all the time and not around your parents. they say that you're raised by your peers after the age of 12 year. Basically your parents are out. Yeah. You're raised by your peers. Yeah. You're constantly with your friends in school. You're constantly with your friends in any activities you have. You're looking for their validation instead of your parents validate. Exactly, and with My friends it was always, who's the sickest fuck?

Speaker 1:          00:58:46       Mike's a sick fuck, you know, steve's just sick as fuck. He doesn't give a fuck. he's crazy and there was a value in that because everybody was scared. That waS really at the bottom line of it. We're all young men and we're on our way to becoming adults and no one knows what the fuck they're going to do and we have a few friends that have graduated highschool and they're losers now and like, shit, that might be me. Like that was the big cloud that was always hanging over everybody's head. What are you doing after high school? What are you doing after high school? And it was like this impending date of doom that was coming up. So everybody was scared all the time and everybody wanted to be. They wanted to be a man. Everybody they wanted to prove themselves. They wanted it to be somethinG special and no one felt special.

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       You know, everybody felt like fucking loser, you know, we're all like waitinG, waiting to become an adult so you could get a job like all these other people you knew that were around you or escape or figuring out a way to escape he had. Then there's always the community colleGe, like people go, well, you know, I'll probably end up when you hear I'll probably end up at the community college. THat's going to be one semester and out. I did that. I went to massbay massbay community college. I did it after a whole year. I took a whole year off and I just, I only went back to school because I didn't want people thinking I was a loser, so I did like maybe one semester at mass bay. I don't even think I finished the semester and then I left and went to umass. Umass boston had this like adult education program.

Speaker 1:          01:00:04       we didn't have to have a ged or a not gad sat because I never took my sats because when I graduated from high school I'm like, I am never going to school again, like, fuck this. But I got so tired of feeling like a fucking loser. Like wHen I tell people is take, I would always say I was taking a year off, took a year off, but it really, I just had no directioN I was doing was doing martial arts and competing and I just was so terrified of what the fuck the future lead. And so I went to umass for like three Years but not like three full years. It was like there was still a lot of credits to be acquired if I was going to graduate and I just was wasting my time. I was barely paying attention. I wasn't doing. I was completely half asking whatever project we had.

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       And then I was realizing like, what am I, why am I wasting my time? Yeah. And then, uh, I got some letter saying that I couldn't come back With the grades that I had unless I came up with some very compelling reason. So they wanted me to make an arguMent for why they should include me back in the class. And I wrote out in handwritten because back then no one had a fuckin typewriter, thiS total bullshit letter, this ridiculous, like a persuasive bullshitty letter about how important education is to me. And I'm like how important it means. And then I realized like the amount of effort that I put writing this bullshit letter to keep these people from kicking me out of their school, which I wasn't paying attention to far exceeds any effort that I ever put on any project ever in class. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       And then I realized, Okay, whatever I'm going to Do with my life, it's not going to involve doing. This is not going to involve someone else dictating my schedule for whatever reason. And you're like, clearly I can write clearly. I can really think maybe common. Yeah. Well, I had a conversation with, um, a science teacher, the science teacher, and it was the same kind of thing. I, I'm mocked him in class, not necessarily mocked him, but I brought up something that was contrary to what he was teaching. He was talking about a lake erie being a dead lake. And I said, listen man, they had a documentary on pbs last night about lake erie making a resurgence and these scientists have figured out these new ways to minimize water pollution and all this shit. And like other kIds looking at me like, what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          01:02:17       And he got pissed at me. He got really pissed at me and he said, you're undermining my class and this is not a go, hey man, you're teaching old shit. This is on tv man. This on tv. Like Yesterday. Yeah. And I had a conversation with them afterwards and because I had to talk to him in order to get back in the class, he kicked me out of class and he said two things. He said, one, he said, first of all, I don't know whether or not that was the case. Whether or not it's true and if I allow you to just interrupt my class and chime in, something like that and it's not true. I haven't fact checked it. You're telling the whole class and I don't know if you're right or you're wrong or you're making things up, but you're interrupting my class.

Speaker 1:          01:02:58       That's the point. If you have something to tell me about it, maybe you could tell me about it after the class and then I can go and look it up and then maybe I can correct the class he was, but to in interrupting the class you showed yourself to be more articulate and more intelligent the you ever showed ever in the entire semester. So you're totally half housing. Everything you do, you're writing everything in paper. You turn in every test you do, every time I call upon you for a question totally half that have asked that, but when you wanted to correct me on something, all of a sudden you knew all the words. You knew how to form the sentence correctly. You've got to say with the right impact. He's like, you just. Your focus is off. I was like, god damn, that dude's on the money, and I realized. I'm like, yeah, so I'm not stupid, right? I just can't. I can't listen. I can't do it.

Speaker 5:          01:03:43       They're way I got to do it my way

Speaker 1:          01:03:45       could. I just didn't. I grew up not having any direction. So someone doesn't tell you what to do all your life, like essentially you just out free. I would go fishing, I'd hang out with my friends in the fucking woods. We just go find shit to do and then all of a sudden you're in school and they're telling you everything you have to do all day. Like, I'm not ready for that.

Speaker 5:          01:04:03       I'm not really that like you're sitting in. I'm fucking shocked. When my kid tells me about it, I go, what was your scheduled today? Well, you know, at eight, 15, we sat down for 15 minutes for homeroom. then at 8:30 I go to my first class, which is an hour and 15 minutes. Then we get five minutes off and we go to another class that's two hours. They got these long fucking class and it goes like that till 3:00, thinking like 25 minutes for lunch and they're sitting be boys with fucking chemicals racing through their bodies and girls at the next desk with fucking short shorts and cleavage and little brown titties sticking him. You know when the breeze hits them and they get a little bit of goosebumps on the inside of the cleavage and that cross jesus is just wedge right in between those two. Brown for the italian horn, the italian, and it's got glitter on it or the italian.

Speaker 1:          01:04:59       How about charm bracelets? Charm bracelets. The fuckIng flip flops. Her toes. She just painted them with toes. Very important. The girl doesn't take care of her toes now. Can't trust her with a pussy. Oh fuck. Yeah. Show me your face. I hate to do this on equal pay day.

Speaker 5:          01:05:19       Oh yeah. No. You go into the salon. You're going to get you're gonna. Get your fucking nails done after you get your coach done.

Speaker 1:          01:05:25       Wow. Very important for greg fitzsimmons. Yeah. Yeah. What'd you the idea of letting those kids get trapped in that system where all day you're just doing that and then you get sitting passively and then you get out and you have more work to do at home. That just sort of eliminated any social life you might have, right? You would think that that would be enough that going to school from seven to three eveRy fucking day or whatever. They made our job. It's almost like an eight hour job and then

Speaker 5:          01:05:52       where you're really working, the average eight hour job, you're checking your email half that time. The average person that's working, is that a cubicle? I talked to people at shows. I listen to your podcast all the time. When at work, what do you do? You know, I work in an office insurance, shouldn't you be selling shirts? Ah, you know, I listen to rogan's podcast everyday. That's three hours now. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:06:17       they're barely working. Nobody fucking works. Nobody's working. Especially if you have any, any sort of gig with any flexibility, like it would just be on your own. You're on your own.

Speaker 5:          01:06:30       You can get it done in a couple of hours. Most you go to europe and a lot of business models are. It's a shorter work day. It's a longer lunch, more vacations. They get the same shit done.

Speaker 1:          01:06:39       You shouldn't have for five days a week either to be four. Yeah, four is good. Three days off is good. When Jamie and I do podcasts, we do more than four days. I'm like, what are we doinG? Working like, we'll come in on the fifth day. I'm like, jesus, jamie, what are we working? Yeah. Even if it's like a fight companion, I'm like, look at us. We're here again, back in the fucking office and this is the greatest job of all time. Imagine if you're selling insurance, you know, or hyundai's. We're really coming down on an insurance salesman. I don't know why. Attack premise. It's easy to ship on. Well,

Speaker 5:          01:07:10       insurance is an interesting gig because if you're on the side where you're writing policies and you're coming up at the fucking numbers on like. Because I remember when I was at boston university, there was a guy at the entity in the aDministration that had figured out the insurance policies, you can take out insurance policies on every student in the university,

Speaker 1:          01:07:31       pay for them,

Speaker 5:          01:07:32       and then the policies would pay back to boston university if you die. There were life insurance policies because this guy looked at the numbers and crunch them and he goes, you know what?

Speaker 1:          01:07:41       This is a fucking great deal. You know what? These kids fucking dIe more often than the insurance company thinks.

Speaker 5:          01:07:47       So they literally took out insurance policies on 30,000 kids. That's unsaleable back to the university and it was a big blow up in the newspaper about it. I was making jokes when I was like, yeah, I was wondering why they took all the traffic lights and on commonwealth.

Speaker 1:          01:08:03       Oh, crazy. They. They celebrate money when you die. What? A bunch of fucking assholes. That's what people used to do when there was no internet. Get away with doing shit like that. No one knew about it for. That's right.

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       Yeah. They probably didn't know about it forever. Somebody had to probably blow the whistle while they was a good student newspaper in boston at bu, but you had a great paper. It was one of the best ones In the country and they cracked the case and they also were very political. We protested against apartheid and then they wouldn't allow. They wouldn't allow opposite sex students to sleep in the in somebody's room, but they had no overnight policy at bu like in fucking 1989. Really? So there was protests about that, which is also really fucking weird because what about gay people? Woo. Right. They can just bang it up. They can pay. The guys can literally fuck each other in the ass. No problem. No problem. Hang it up. You know, probably a few problems wIth a few problems. Hemorrhoids. And remember when you used to get the girl that had a, a dorm used to find the time where her roommate agreed to be out of the room so you fuck right, or you would come back into the room after the roommate fucked and it just smelled like a fucking wall

Speaker 1:          01:09:22       asshole. Like cheeses. No ventilation window done in this room.

Speaker 1:          01:09:35       That that's true. All the other smells. The smell with first. Well, yeah, because nobody. Look, if you're not using a bid day, people were wiping their ass and back then no one even shaved girls had asshole hair standard. It was standard. You'd find dingleberry's on girls all the time. Right? People just smudge that shit after. After they poop, they smudge. That shit smudge it around. Yeah. And then when you're fucking, you're sweating and pounding and the grease from your sweat gets in her ass. Crack and shit goes down through the taint into her asshole swishes around with the, uh, with the shit stain and what each pump of your hips, your wafting smells through the air. And it permeates the atmosphere. It sticks to the curtains and think about it. It's like a fireplace. Bellows furnace is a furnace and You're fucking pumping air onto shit and pussy. Boy,

Speaker 6:          01:10:45       there's

Speaker 1:          01:10:45       no windows. the room is like a jail cell. It's like eight by 10 and the dude probably smells like shit too. They probably both small. Terrible. So he's sweating his ass. Hold dirty too. He's probably even dirtier is absolutely, probably a more of a disaster area. It's probably hammer here. Right. So as he sweat and his sweats going on the crack of his ass and yeah, that's all wafting in the room as well, right? Air fucking arm pits. Yeah, that was intense. Man. Was some intense smells

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       back then. And then you didn't clean your sheets suppressing in january? No. May. There was no mother you. I cleaned. Right. Here's what, here's my laundry cycle. In college I had 30 pairs of underwear, 30 t shirts, 30 pairs of socks, one pair of sheets and once a month I went downstairs and I shoved all that shit into the fucking oversize washing machine and I was done and if those sheets got come on him, which they did joe rogan on a regular basis, they stayed that way. They stayed cake. The that was like the sheet at a fucking jack shack at seven Pm full of dna. Ari shaffir didn't change his sheets

Speaker 1:          01:11:50       for six months as an adult, aS an adult when he was working at the store. Why did want to lazy? Never cleaned his room, his, his, his apartment was a disaster and then one day he smartened up and just cleaned the whole place out. Wow. Yeah. Now he's a neat freak. Yeah. I realized I stayed in his apartment in New York. It was fucking nice. Yeah. He realized, look, arusha fears of smart dude. He's a smart dude. He bounces back, figure shit out, figures shit out. He bounces back. You know, he's been off the grid for three months now. Nobody knows where he is. Are you serious? Yeah. there's pictures of him in Vietnam. Some people have found them in Vietnam. They took pictures with them and they put it online. No shit. Yup. He shut off his phone. Doesn't accept incoming calls. He is not answering emails.

Speaker 1:          01:12:34       He told comedy central, fuck you. I'm disappearing for three months to laws. Friends told us, hey, see you guys in a few months. I don't know how long it's going to go. Have fun. He goes, I just Want to disconnect. So it just completely disconnected. He's been traveling. How long ago was this? Three months ago. He did a podcast with Henry Rollins. This is where he fucked up. I did a podcast with Henry Rollins. Henry rollins is a fascinating guy. Fascinating guy. Angry motherfucker. He's very angry. Yeah. But when you talked to him and you get to know his story, all the pieces sort of fall into place. He was one of the earliest, um, children that they put on prozac or ritalin, excuse me, ritalin. They put him on ritalin, which is speed when he was really young, like five. And so he would talk about how he'd go to school, just white knuckling until the ritalin were off.

Speaker 1:          01:13:25       The ritalin would wear off, like at the end of the day, we finally calmed down. So his whole life he was just like jacked up on speed. Like his development cycle was kinda like impaired, but jacked up on speed in my opinion. The way he describes it, I understand how. I don't know. There's not a rational argument to me that they wouldn't have any significant impact on his life being on speed all throughout his childhood years until he discovered exercise, start to exercise in high school. Then he slowly got off the ritalin and all that stuff, but so he's developmentally like that was challenGed in a lot of ways, but he's a fascinating guy, man. He just picks a spot on a map like bali. Okay, let's go see boli. Henry rollins. Yeah, by himself. He just goes there, brings a laptop so you can write, brings cameras. We can take pictures and writes now

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       and just does that. Travels all over the world. Just goes to all these different places. He goes and hangs out with bedouins in the desert. He goes, listens to weird, crazy music. These people are making and sweared culture so just shows up and africa shows up in all these different places. Just goes there, flies in. So ari has them on his podcast and I think our. I was so compelled by the idea of just completely this picking a spot and going that are. He decided for his. Because you. He's like super cognizant about africa does a special. Like he needs more material. So what he does is he filmed a special, filmed it, edited it, and then disappeared and then just vanished for like three months as of right now, three months. And what's your theory on where he is? I don't have one. I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait until he comes back and then I'm going to talk to them, see what's up. And he might not even want to talk about it. You know what I mean? He's such a, he's such an interesting guy. He might just decide how a good time you don't want to talk about it. And that'd be like, right. You know, and maybe he'll decide that the great experiences would best be reserved for the stage. Like he met. He might have like cultivated some really good experiences. He wants to only get about on stage. He's a weird guy, but in the best

Speaker 3:          01:15:19       way, in the best way. I mean, there's a sense of fairness about him also, like I remember because I did his show last season and we did rehearsal for it at the comedy store in the belly room and all of a sudden you get this fucking nice check

Speaker 3:          01:15:33       and it's like, oh no, our, he wanted all you guys to split this money and then I did another show from somewhere else and it was like, I'm just like, yeah, you do the same thing. but he does it to a point where it's like he's very aware of being as fair as possible. So like when we did his tv show, he gave us all a gift. I won't say what it was, but uh, it was illegal and every single person and it was expensive and every single person got this gift. Like he's very thoughtful about that kind of shit.

Speaker 4:          01:16:05       Yeah. He's just an awesome guy. When I met him, he was an open miker raw open miker just started, right? Young guy just got the store working as a doorman. And then one day I was supposed to take Mike Young with me and Mike Young was doing the road with me a little bit and michael and couldn't make it. So uh, I took ari and he had never really been paid before. You know, it never really done. Like, I think he'd gone out with paulie, done some shows, have poly, but I dunno, I could never. He, I think I brought her to the comedy works in denver. You crushed while I was on stage crushing. I hold the phone up for Mike Young. I go, you fucked up mike. I go, listen. And aria was onstage kill. And he's like, no, no, no. And I hung up on him because you fucked up red. Red is my new guy. So he's just, it was just cool knowing him to, as an open mic or like knowing him as a guy who just started out and now seeing him as a guy with a television show, a successful podcast, but even more important, a truly independent

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       thinker. yeah. Like he really is independent. Like he's, he thinks his own way. He's not, he doesn't let anybody influence. I mean he, he'll take suggestions so talk to people. He's reasonable, but he has an idea like what he wants to do with his life and he's just doing it. Just a fucking super smart dude. Yeah. How? I thought it was in New York has bumped because I'm going to be in the, in New York for this might be. He might be by now. Yeah. I mean when he reemerged as he may end up in New York. I get this feeling. I'm sure one day I'll just get her what's up? faggot text out of nowhere and I'm like, oh, he's back. Yeah. God, that's weird. I had no idea it was that long. I heard he was away, but I know it's three months. Yeah. He's freaking everybody out.

Speaker 2:          01:17:49       Dunkin's like, dude, what do I do? I don't know where he is. Like dunkin stay in his apartment in New York. How he is. He's like, man, I was supposed to be back a month ago. What do I do? like, I don't know man. I'm just going to accept it. Hopefully he's not dead. So is dunkin going to stay in New York when he gets back? I believe so. I believe dunkin likes it there. He's been dOing a lot of standup there. He's been traveling, doing all this crashing show from may until auGust in New York. So I got a, I got to be in brooklyn the first month because it's a um, it's a writing month. We get officers out there and then three months we'll be shooting all around the city and wherever. So if anybody has an aparTment for me in New York, june, july and august, I'll fucking take it. Can I announce a couple of dates? Yeah. Alright. Do you like old school radio guy coming up? Does that make sense? And plugs. We're going to be fed

Speaker 2:          01:18:41       philadelphia, helium, april 27 slash 29. That's a good club, right? The best clubs ever. Twenty seven through 29. And then here's one I think you liked just as much, if not more. Denver comedy works May 4th through the sixth. My number one, not number one. It's the right up there with the ice house. Have fucking happy. Am I right now? That's good. Good. You got two good fucking bangers and our other fellow and then mohegan sun in Connecticut. May 11, 2013. Do that. Don't turn your thumb down either. Just don't do it. Connecticut gets so mad. Brooklyn the bauhaus. June third. You ever play the bell house in brooklyn spot? Yeah, it's supposed to be great. That's it. I haven't played club. Ever should get there. I used to do. There was a comedy club in brooklyn back in the day. There was a comedy club in bensonhurst.

Speaker 2:          01:19:30       Oh, right. Yeah. What the fuck was that? Was it it next to a gym? Like a big meathead? probably. I think it was the member of the one in the one that dice started out pips. Mr. Pip sip system or I think it was just pips. Mr pepper is the drink, right? Yeah. Pips in brooklyn. Yeah, that's joey cola told me he was on stage there and a guy showed him his gun, said he's onstage. That guy's heckling him and he's like a mob guy and these guys will just look at. I'm going, fuck you. Fuck you. And joe. He's like, hey, what's your fucking problem? And the guy pulls his jag inside and

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       shows him a gun like god, jesus and the club wouldn't do nothing. Just had to tell, tell your jokes. And I had a damn. That's a. That's a distracted second half you're set. You're not thinking about much else except that gun. You're getting through it. So you're doing. You ain't getting any laughs. Alright. Okay. I just started to fuck your life up and he might kill you. Yeah, there's a lot of those guys. did you ever read murder machine? Now? Murder machine is about roy de mayo, who is a famous hitman murdeRer, capo. Fucking character in the mob. People were like mob store. Probably mad at me right now, but it's a book that joey diaz gave me and it's. You can't put it down. You start reading it. You can't put it down. It's all about how horrific this fucking guy was and how many people he killed his man come with something like that, but he worked.

Speaker 4:          01:21:01       He was a mob guy himself. He had a bar that was downstairs and above the bar, that apartment, and they killed people in the apartment and caught him up in the tub and they killed hundreds of people. No shit just killed. He killed people for fun telling people left and right. It started out. It was killing people like, you know, mob things and someone owed money or something and they just was killing people just on the weekends. Wind didn't trust people. Start killing them and I don't like the way you're looking at me dead. Just killing people. It's a crazy book, man. So can you go to jail? I don't. I don't remember. That's a good question. See what happened with roy de mayo. Murder machine was the name of the book. Joey d is like dog. You gotta fucking read this. You've got to read this. I couldn't put it down. I couldn't put it down. Unfucking believable and it's just some fucking complete psychopath and a group of other sites.

Speaker 3:          01:21:56       Why is it we can't stop. Like, you know, karen killed. Gareth has that podcast. I'm a my favorite murder. Is that all about murders? Every week they talk about a different gruesome murder to class. Yeah, it's really good. But um, but what is it about us that like I love the iceman cometh and uh, there was, there was another one that was about a serial killer. I mean just earlier talking about the, the angel of death guy. Like what is it about us that is so interested in people that take human life? Do you think that it's like a part of us that it's an unexpressed thing? Like if we were cavemen we would kill,

Speaker 4:          01:22:33       you know, I think there's a lot of energy attached to it, meaning negative, negative energy, but still energy, like you can't look away. It's the same reason why you watch like car accidents or you watch youtube videos about someone doing a stunt that goes wrong and they accidentally drive off a bridge. Like, I don't know if you've ever seen the one with the guy in the wing suit, tries to buzz a bridge and he calculates it wrongly, slams into the bridge. It sounds like a fucking car accident. He slammed in the bridge going like, who knows, 150 miles an hour or something crazy like that. It's horrific. Just fall straight down in the water. Yeah, I mean he hit the bridge so hard. He might've just. I mean he, if he didn't have a suit on, he might have just exploded into like a ball of jello or something, you know? But because he had the suit on and kind of kept all the blood and body parts in place. Yeah, he hit it so hard. Dude. I mean it literally sounds like a, like a car accident because he's slamming into the metal of the bridge at 100 fucking whatever miles an hour with nothing on but a helmet. Do you regret having seen that? Like does that in your mind? Well, no.

Speaker 4:          01:23:36       No. It's not pleasant, but there's something about those things. It's like there's an energy attached. Oh jesus. Oh jesus. Oh jesus, boom. Fuck right. There's a great. I'm in a twitter page called hold mY beer and it's all like, hold my beer while I lied this firework off in my mouth. Hold my beer while I go And pet this tiger. one fucking her rafik disaster after another. We just like, what the fuck man. I like this one.

Speaker 7:          01:24:13       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:24:16       Yeah. Well it's this one. Hold my beer while become a rocket turret. Watch this guy. He's got a firebomb and it's facebook. Just fucking hooks hooks his face. This one is ridiculous. why am I being white crowd that glass musical chair. It looked like a girl to girl. Took that dude. That's fucking great. WaTch this one. Hold our beers while we go skateboarding down this hill. This one's fucking horrific. These guys come down the hill and they just have no way to stop your skateboard. It's a little thin lane. You can't even. You can't even cut back. watch this dude.

Speaker 4:          01:25:07       Ooh son. Not good. Okay. I've seen it's like america's funniest home videos for grownups. Exactly, but I never got into watching the faces of death and shit like that. Although a lot of those I think were fake, but there are obviously beheadings I've never. Have you ever watched a beheading? You have good. Yeah. Don't regret it. Yeah, but why do people watch them again? It's because there's energy attached to it. You know there's a consequence of what's happening. you're watching something you're gonna have. The consequence doesn't really manifest itself. Like watching people do balancing acts on the top of skyscrapers. Even if you know they survived, which is how you got the footage in the first place, it still freaks you the fuck out. I can't stop. You know Kelly Slater, the surfer, he sends me those. He knows like they freaked me out. So we send each other back and forth fucked up videos about dudes doing balancing acts on the side of buildings.

Speaker 4:          01:25:58       Like what the. I can't watch those man. My hands start sweating. My asshole starts squeezing. I just go, what the fuck are you doing? There's a lot of that shit and Russia dudes hanging off the sides of buildings by their fingertips. You ever see those? Yes. Do they do like hanging with one arM? You know how hard it is to fucking hang from one arm and to hang from one arm when you're 700 feet in the air or something crazy. It just makes you think how little human life means in Russia. Those dudes look, kill at the drop of a hat. Alex, alex honnold. He's been on the podcast before. He's insane. He is so crazy. He free Solos, which mean look, my hands are full. My hands. Yeah. So remind. Oh yeah. Sweat to go back to alex. So, because these guys are fucking crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:26:47       Alex is like the number one free solo guy in the world or at least one of the number one guys. And what that means is he doesn't use ropes. Yeah. So he'll map out a, um, a climb. Sometimes we'll map it out and sometimes it was just a path that you can take and sometimes we'll map it out with ropes. But he's like, you know, honestly, even while I'm doing it with the ropes, I don't really need the ropes. I'm like, what the fuck? And so he does this and he freaks people out and he freaks out even experienced climbers. And there waS a documentary they did about them where this guy was like an experienced climber. It was like, it's not. IF he's going to die, it's a matter of when he's going to die. Right. But that's probably a helIcopter taking his picture or a drone.

Speaker 4:          01:27:28       Right. Fucking a man. If it's a helicopter would probably be too dangerous. The breeze from the helicopter would be super dangerous. I used to do shit like that. I got, I got a picture of me hanging out with my friends. Fourth floor balcony badlands. Nice to do that shit all the time. Yeah, to my book. I got the picture of my book. Jesus christ. Dude. Yeah. I used to like to freak people out. Oh my god. This alex honnold dude. Sometimes he. He climbed things that aren't even straight up and down. They bend backwards to a certain degree facing forward hoses. This girl, well, I've seen this. She's hot as fuck. The whole video where they went up to him, this was, this girl grabbed the guy's hand and he held her over the edge. Yeah. That girl is so crazy to trust that guy. He can fuck her forever by the way. Forever. Forever for like he owns it.

Speaker 4:          01:28:23       That's so insane. Freaks me the fuck out, but I don't stop. I can't watch this. Stop what you're doing. Freaking me out. I can't do this and still talk because I can't. I can't talk and then do that. I watched those things have a massive physical effect on me. Yeah, but alex. Anyway, he, he climbed stuff. It's facing forward so he's literally hanging straight up and down, wedging his hands into these cracks and like moving along and then he's got to reach in for the powder and powder. the thing. He was on the podcast, he told me the story about how he was climbing once and he realized when he was halfway up this mountain and he forgot his powder. Oh. So he gets to these fucking people. They're also climate and they're on ropes and he goes, hey man, can I borrow your powder? And the guy's like, okay, I think god gives him his powder bag and then when it got to the top, he left the powder bag for the dude. It's insane. He's insane. He's climbing. He does. He is like, what did I forget? I got my fingers. That's all I need.

Speaker 3:          01:29:21       Ah, look. powder shit. Well, those, what do you call that thing? the, that the guy died under the bridge at bat bat suit or a wingsuit wing suit. It was a whole thing on, I don't know if it's hbo sports or 60 minutes about the people that do that. A friend andy does it. Oh really? Our friend and he's a world record holder, but the mortality rate is extremely high. He took it. Are

Speaker 4:          01:29:42       he? He took two guys off the mountain last year that died. Doing it? Yeah. Yeah. He, he's a maniac. But he's the. He's got the longest distance ever. Someone's ever done one of those fucking wingsuit? Yeah. How far do you go? Something saying like 30 miles or something.

Speaker 3:          01:29:56       Yeah. And they glide along the sides of cliffs and shit. Eighteen miles. Eighteen miles miles dab with no break. All you can do is catch you catch a gust of wind and your fucking toe.

Speaker 4:          01:30:09       Yeah. Yeah. Or you're toast. Go full screen on this bitch. This is so insane. Look a fucking high. He jumped out of a helicopter. I don't think that's a helicopter. I think that's a plane now, isn't it? Yeah. That's a plane. I think a helicopter be a harder thing to jump out of. I'm just guessing because the way the wind is pressing downward. Does that make sense? I don't know. I don't know shit about what would happen. Yeah, there is a plane. Yeah, so he gets up there and he does this all the fucking time. He'll like send me pictures because he knows it freaks me out. He'll send me pictures of him jumping off some fucking mountain in Guatemala or something like look at that is so insane. Going 163 miles an hour. Like Why? What is this is how we're going to be dropping our troops into the next step. Not too many people would be willing to do it. Well, not, not willing, rAther capable. I think you would. You got to be a special person to be able to pull off a fucking flying squirrel suit. Yeah. I mean

Speaker 3:          01:31:12       he ever jumped out of a plane. No, you don't want to do it. Fuck that. I'd do it. You should do it. Then just don't tease me. Jumping off the mountain is way crazier when they're just skimming it and jumping out of a plane where you know this guy's parachute. That's cool. But that's not like these guys on 60 minutes. They were. He's the same guy. The sides of cliffs. He does it too. He does that same to. Oh, he does that too. He does the whole thing. This is just a world record.

Speaker 4:          01:31:36       This is the furthest distance ever fucking call that man. Hey tina, my friend cam up cam when a skydive, but yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck that. Now

Speaker 3:          01:31:52       I don't like free falling. I know. I don't like that feeling like I've been on bungee cords and it's, it's pure fucking torture. You and your drops out on

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       you. That doesn't feel good, but I think it equalizes when you jump out of a plane, doesn't it?

Speaker 4:          01:32:05       I don't know, but I know that brian, brian redman, whose dad used to work with this lady and the girls always like, hey, why don't you go skydiving with us? He's like, yeah, will one day, one day. Then one day he gets there on monday. No, we're so and so. You didn't hear her. She died. It's really chute. Didn't open up backup chute. Didn't open up. Here comes the ground. 100 60 miles an hour. Boom. He does bounce off that fucking ground and become jello. Jello, Oregon. Six crush to the bottom of your body. Everything is destroyed. Yeah. Might go through a barn or something. Slammed through a barn, slamming into some fence posts. Hundred 60 miles an hour. Just tears you and a half. Yeah. Fuck man. Fuck yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:32:58       I don't even like roller coasters anymore. we did. I did a roller coaster two years ago in Florida at busch gardens if you want to. If you're into rollercoasters, disney and universal, they've got a couple that are good, but busch gardens is like the red neck paradise. It's like, it's like the guY's the fucking carnies. They've run these ancient rollercoasters that are insane, like the twisting corkscrews, but there's like 10 of them and they're fucking. You go. You cAn ride every one of them three times in a day. It's fuck fucker atlanta. Drive down to tampa, go to busch gardens. But I went and it fucked up my neck too. To this day I have a bad neck from spinning around on those fucking rollercoaster. I already had a bad neck, but it tweaked it in a way that I've never. I've never come back from.

Speaker 1:          01:33:46       Well, the inertia, when you run those things you've ever done the what is the one that was a crazy one at six flags like the x something or another. While you go upside down and back and forth, you're in, you're in a harness, you, they strap you into this thing and you flip up and down. You spin around and you're going on a rollercoaster. Yeah, so you're on a rollercoaster and you're spinning around. You get off that thing. Like what the fuck is wrong with me? Yeah. Like I'm getting nauseous. Just thinking about. I know my son is friends are into that shit when you're 16. It's fucking perfect. Yeah. They want to make something happen. When you're 16, you want something to take place. Yeah. Like come on, let's go. Let's go. I want something to happen here.

Speaker 5:          01:34:25       That's why I had sex so much when I was young is I just wanted to do something that was a goal that you could achieve and then you could go back and tell your friends about it. Yet a story. I didn't care about the girls. I hate say that I really didn't care about the girls. I didn't have a girlfriend till I was in college. I didn't even think about having

Speaker 4:          01:34:45       friend. When you first started having sex, did you not want to do anything else? All I wanted to do was masturbate and have sex. I used to have a joke about it. Well, my dad was like, what happened at baseball? Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       I found this new thing. I like it. I'll get better the fuck outta here. Hitting that stupid ball with a stick ball. What do you just. No chicks out there. There's no girls that come to baseball games. when I got off school, I'll sit and you're dressed in fucking dea. Jordache jeans and you're flaring airbag. What happened to baseball? I found pussy. Yeah, like the first, like slow, steady, like all the time, sex that I got, I think it was either 16 or 17 and I had a girlfriend who was a year younger than me. And you know why I was nervous about it because when I turned 18, people were telling me that I could get arrested. It's right because she was oNly 17, like you get arrested for statutory rape and I was like, what? But a blank. But we dated before when it was okay, but it doesn't matter.

Speaker 2:          01:35:45       You have to stop. Oh my god. I was terrified. I thought I was going to go to jail. That's crazy. That means you're 18. You have to only bang someone your age or older. Who. I'll take it a step further. I've been talking about this in my act of like how I still jerk off to like I'll think about girls from high school that I went to high school with and I'll jerk off to them. I don't know. And then uh, I got the yearbook and I looked up this one girl, jill, I won't say her last name and I was jerking off to her picture and then I was like, I was like, I think this is wrong, but then I thought no because I used to jerk off to her before I was an adult, so maybe I'm grandfathered in. I would say you are.

Speaker 2:          01:36:21       I'm grandfathered in, right? Yeah. If you start jerking off to one of your kids, 17 year old friends. Yeah. That's fucked up. That's fucked. That's a felony. No. if you get pictures, if I look at a yearbook to like say I find it 2016 yearbook right from hollywood high school. Okay. I find it at a flea market and I take it home and I'm jerking off to girls that are 14, 15, 16 years old. Is that not kiddie porn? No, because there's no pornography and so 100 percent up to your imagination. It's like if you seen a girl scene, those varsity field hockey skirts. No, I'm not into that. But if you see a girl walking down the street and you know, you think she's on the edge like 17 or 18 and you don't know, like, I don't even know. I'm just going to say she's 19 and she's just, you know, I'm just guessing and then you go beat off and are you any worse than if you knew she was 17?

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       Have you see her? She's got a big fat ass and big juicy young titties and she's walking on the street like, oh my god, I can't believe she's only 17. And then you go home and jerk off tour. That's different, right? Knowing knowing makes it creepy. yes. Yes. Because you're jerking off to the age as well as the image. If you're going up to the image, you're fine. Yeah. If you just see the girl walking down the street and she's like, god, what do you think? Illegal. It's like if you're gonna shoot a moose, they have to be 52 inches in Alaska, which means, which means the, uh, the antlers have to have either a certain amount of brow tines or they'd have to be a certain distance apart from each other. They want the hunters only to hunt mature animals that have already bred, like just the idea of the conservation aspect

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       of it to keep the breeding population strong. Yeah. So when you're ready to shoot an animal, especially if using a rifle, you have to be really sure. You have to like, boy, I don't know. I don't know he's coming, he's coming. I don't know if he's, I don't know if he's legal, but let's back up, let's back up. And it happens all the time. Or guys like fuck. And then you know, it turns out it was leak or if it wasn't legal that's a good thing to shoot it because even though it's an arbitrary thing like decide or weird thing, like trying to decipher whether or not something is 50 plus inches from 200 yards away. Like you're just kind of guessing. And a lot of ways, yeah, they, it's a really important because if you fuck up and you shoot one that's young, you're in deep shit it.

Speaker 1:          01:38:33       Yeah. Yeah. So you could just make a mistake and shoot a bull that's 45 inches. You're fucked. He'll lose your license. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're going to have to pay a fine. You lose the animal. You won't be able to take the animal home. And they check. Yeah, they'll check. Yeah. And all the meat that you got from that animal you fucked unless you poach it. Unless you decided to not tell anybody. Which people do. Do they especially do. If they realize they fucked up, they fucked up on purpose or they got delusion with themselves and they shoot something that's smaller than it should be. Like you're in big trouble though when you do, depending on the state. Every state has different regulations. But that's kinda the same thing with this 18 year old girl because like some girls are 19. They lived with their 15, like some girls are in their 2015. Well, it is weird when you see girls with porn with pigtails and they pretend to be just coming home from school and some guy pulls their pants, his son and fucks him and comes in their mouth and it's like, what am I watching?

Speaker 3:          01:39:22       And they act like children act like kids. They act like young girls. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, but that's,

Speaker 1:          01:39:29       you know, that's a woman playing a role. You know, she's over 18, she's a fully committed adult, but there's a, there's some girls that are like 14 and he was like, they're 18 that especially when you're across the street, you're not close to them. You don't like catch subtle cues that you're dealing with a child. Right. You know, there's like weird, like a lot of girls in particular are full grown by the time you're like 15, you know, like there, that's as tall as they're ever going to get. Whereas boys keep growing a little bit longer.

Speaker 3:          01:39:58       I grew in college. Yeah. They say girls after they have their periods stop growing or that makes sense and stopping pleasant.

Speaker 3:          01:40:07       You know, if I, if I'm at the beach, if I, if I'm at the beach and I see a girl and she's with a girl that I can tell is under 18, but she doesn't look under 18, I won't look at her just out of fear that she must be under 18 because you don't want to put her in this bank bank. She's got to stay out of the spank bank. She's. Yeah, I put aI. put a yellow tag on her. Very ethical. Well, it's hard because once you have kids that are teenagers, it's fucking scary. It's like, you know, my fucking son is 16 years old, but let's admit that that is a gray area. Yeah. who knows?

Speaker 1:          01:40:47       That could be the older sister, you know, it could be one girl and her older sister, like she might be 19 friend, might

Speaker 4:          01:40:53       be 17. She could be a 51 point buck. She could be bull bull, bull moose, 51 inch block. Jesus christ. You've got to kill that thing. what's the youngest girl you ever had sex with when you were a teenager? I was, I think I was 16. My girlfriend was 15 and she was the first girl I ever had sex with, so that was the youngest. Who's 15 years. She's 15 now. 16. Yeah. I came instantly. As soon as it touched it, I was like, what? What happened? The first time I ever came was blow job. I never beat off and there were serious. For real. That must have been the greatest blue. Jay paul ties dab and chasing that dragon. Yes. My ears rang. I'll never forget. It was on the porch, the front porch of my girlfriend's house. Her mom was upstairs, so she blew me on the porch.

Speaker 4:          01:41:49       No shit. Yeah. Had she blown a guy before, I'm sure seems like it. If she's on the front porch. She has been around a couple of cox. She actually had sex with one of my friends before she had sex with me and my friend was like a, a real weird. He was like a city guy where I was like, we were living in the suburbs. My friend was my friend actually before I knew her from back when I lived in Jamaica plain and he was always a really weird guy. He was like one of those guys that would wear those black reebok's with the velcro. Yeah, like the, like the aerobic shoes. And then he had cavalry cheese, like you dressed well back then that was dressing well and I always felt like super insecure. I'm like, wow. She dated that guy. That guy was like street smart and you know, like he kinda like, he was like, he was hip smokes cigarettes.

Speaker 4:          01:42:36       He knew how to dance. He could dance like music speakers are speakers. Who was just a weird guy. He was a really weird guy. Was he a guido? No, no, I don't think he was italian. He was, I don't remember what he was, some non distinct european lineage. But uh, she banked him and then that didn't work out. She actually made out with him once at my house the first time. But was like, when your kids, we played spin the bottle I'll make out with each other and we didn't know what the fuck we're doing. We couldn't even believe that we make, we can make out with each other. Like, wow, this is amazing, you know. So wait. So you get the blow job. You've never had a hand job, you've never jerked off? Nope. Why did you never took off? Um, I didn't. I didn't know that it would be like that worth doing. Like I didn't jerk off until after I was having sex, believe it or not. And this was when you were, what? 15 at this point? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. 15 or 16 maybe. Maybe 16 because I had sex. I, I'm pretty sure I had sex. I think it was like, right when I was 16. She was 15. That's when we actually had sex. She mIght have blown me before I was 16. But anyway, um, my ears rang.

Speaker 4:          01:43:48       I couldn't believe it. I was like, what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       Like I came so hard. It was this reward system that like the universe and biology, it's set up this crazy reward system to try to get you to breed. It's really interesting because when you're at your least responsible, your least developed. Your brain is mush. Brain was useless when I was 15 years old. I had a monkey's brain and it was this just ridiculous, silly brain. No way did I have any like sense of responsibility or how to take care of a kid. Like impossible. Yeah. I didn't even have my own shit even remotely together and my body wanted me to have a baby. You wanted to trick me. I was horny all the time, like ruthlessly horny, you know, and after that girl gave me a blow job, then we want to be in boyfriend and girlfriend having sex all the time. We just fucked constantly.

Speaker 1:          01:44:44       Kind of just. Oh, maybe twice. that's crazy. Yeah, definitely not smart because back then you're not dribbling out of load. You are fucking rock it deep into the cervix and rethread you're trying to pull out. So guests, I guess somehow or another pulled it off. Wow. You got lucky or she had a couple of abortions. She didn't tell him about the possible a new, a lot of girls in an abortion, so not even with me, which is like girls in town, one girl at three of them. And we're like, jesus, honey, get on the fucking pill. Yeah, get on the pill. Right? Um, but my girlfriend in high school got on the pill and then it was just like, just rockets right in there.

Speaker 1:          01:45:27       It'S ridiculous because when you're a young kid, like the idea of the pill is a strange thing, right? You're circumventing biology. You're saying that's not good for the nature's I know what you're fucking plan was. I know what you're trying to do, but guess what? No one's ready for this when you were 16. Okay, so we're going to give someone the pill. But for girls it's a terrible deal. They got to take these fucking wacky hormones going to take estrogen when you're 16. Like what does that do to them? yeah. You know, they say it does. One of the big things, it fucks up a woman's ability to differentiate whether or not cheese compatible with a guy. Oh really? Yeah. They've done these things where they take women and they'll have them smell a guy's clothes, clothes that a guy wore and they can decide and they can just pick from the smell whether or not they would be compatible with that guy.

Speaker 1:          01:46:16       It turns out they're really good at picking whether or not they're genetically compatible with that guy. Wow. But that gets totally monkey wrench into the gears as soon as they get on the pill, when they get on the pill that their sense of smell doesn't work anymore like that. That sort of weird primate instinct. The animal instincts of being able to smell whether or not the guys compatible with you. It doesn't work anymore. Dude, I knows rape this girl at the gym. Yesterday I was on the treadmill and she was next to me and she had long black hair

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       and she tussled it up and put it into a bun and whatever conditioner she had was floating over. Then she started running. She was this persian girl in the armpits were fucking emitting. I was running with my head at a 45 degree angle. Inhaling through my nose exhaling to my mouth. Just knows raping her. Did you have a plan? If she said, why are you leaning towards me? tell her about the rollercoaster. You can Tell her about. Listen, I got. I gotta to tell you. I will tell you the story. It's Crazy. Long story. Do you have time? I'll buy you a cup of coffee. Can we just stand a little closer to this position? gardens. Tampa fucked my neck up on a rollercoaster. It's the craziest roller coaster. She forgets her sweatshirt. I'm down to the men's room. Just fucking.

Speaker 3:          01:47:35       I mean she had. She was hot. She was running. I usually run with the Iran at a six point two miles an hour, which is pretty slow, But it keeps my heart rate at 1:35, which I need to do for like 40 minutes straight. She was running at fucking eight point five miles an hour, which is pretty goddamn fast because she was small and a nice, nice tan, little persian legs, but the smell of fucking unibrow, she was a little gland. She was a gland. It was coming out. It was coming up from the undercarriage everywhere and I'm just running and I'm trying to. It was like a. It was like a powdery flowery thing mixed with a pit stink. Those are the girls, like a really sexy persian girls are, I guess you would say iranian if you weren't being politically correct. Hilarious. They call them till persian. Yeah. That's what a purchase since like 1930. Right. Mike, let's just call ourselves africans. Yeah. Because we all have to go like, oh, you're persian. Oh, elaborate. Introduced my friend. He's from the ottoman empire and I'm a hittite.

Speaker 3:          01:48:50       That's hilarious. Yeah, but the, uh, I Was sitting on a bench one day. this couple walk past me. Curl was pretty hot. Little nose rape. Take it in nice and small. I got a very strong, um, uh, what do you call your nose? Sense of smell? A factory loan factory. I got a very strong olfactory sense and so I was like really enjoying it. And then, uh, about 10 minutes later the guy walks past me and he smells good too. That was the smell. Oh no, no, no. What was he wearing? Like petroleum or Something? It was, it was spicy. That's one of those things. It was so off that a girl could pull off to like both hippie species, male and female. Both genders can wear but truly merits mark marin. Whereas virtually I don't believe you. Yes he does. I might have to find that out. Grateful dead music and purely oil. Really? Where's petula? Oh, dairy.

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       Really? You sure? He just fucking with me. You know, I, I'm, I'm almost 100 percent sure. Not all the time to start. He has in the past. Warren pachulia. Do you think some girl fucked him at one point in his life because he was wearing petrolia and he's like, look, just roll the dice. If a really cancels out, I don't want that kind of pressure. Like if a girl doesn't fuck me because I'm wearing, but truly I don't want that kind of pressure. That's true. It's a lot of pressure. Yeah. Yeah. That's my argument for the fanny pack. Well guys like, oh jeez, if you murdered, I'm like, listen to me, if I wasn't married I'd be more inclined to wear it because if a girl won't fuck you because you wear a fanny pack, you don't want her to fuck you. It's too much work. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:50:24       I love seeing single guys who have that attitude. That is the attitude. You kind of have that attitude. Otherwise you get distracted and that's what I learned from beating off. It's one the things I learned from beating off when I first started beating off, which I told you after I had sex. Yeah. I realized like, oh, this is what's going on. I got my little addict, like I came and I was like, I don't really need to go out with her. I think this is not necessary. Like before I was like, I got to see here what am I going to see her when I'm going to use here. But I wOuld beat off and it would give me a few hourS of relief and where I could think clearly. Right, Okay. Just have a bit way back iN the day about jerk off first. Then think about it that it should be like an ethic that men approached their entire life with some fucking terrible mistakes you make when you're under the influence of your own dick.

Speaker 4:          01:51:04       Because your own dick will talk in all sorts of stupid situations. But if you jerk off first, you know you're not goIng to go into a barn at 4:00 in the morning with some crazy girls doing coke. Like I gotta go like, yeah, if you jerked off. And she's like, come on, you're fucking scared. Like I'm scared. I'm scared. Got to go see a your horn. And you're like, alright, let's do this. Right? You want me to suck your dick? Yeah, you want me to suck your dick? You got to do some coke with a kid just doing coke and they can't even get it up. You Faggot. How can we can't get it up? Faggot doing fucking coke. I'm supposed to suck your dick. He not even getting it up. Sorry.

Speaker 5:          01:51:45       And it's 4:30 in the morning. You should never be up at 4:30. Still trying to get laid. That's what happens. You start doing the coke and all sudden you went to a bar that close, you went to another book, you're fucking thrown down. KaShi. You haven't even gotten laid yet and you're still che. Then she wants to go to denny's and then you got to go hang out at her house and she wants to do more coke and then also at 4:30 in the morning, it's not. You don't even give a fuck anymore. It's like

Speaker 4:          01:52:12       it's got to happen in the first two hours and he knows a horrible one for me in the summer when this would happen and I had jobs so it'd be like 4:30 in the morning and I'd be still trying to get laid and then I had to be up at seven to go to my construction job. a oh cb carrying wood all day exhausted. He didn't shower. So you get that oil, he fucking stank and your under carriage. Your ball sack is sticking to your thigh. I'd come home and fall asleep before he even got my clothes off. I just hit the fucking bed sideways. Out cold. Yeah. Wake up in the morning and do it all over

Speaker 5:          01:52:47       again. Oh Yeah. I used to park cars at a country club and we would go out all we would get paid in cash tips. We'd make a good one, hundred and 50 bucks in cash. I was 16, 17 years old. we go out to the bars, do shots all night, get laid. We go skinny dipping. There was a pool that we'd break into and it was a bunch of teenagers that would all skinny dip on any given night in the summer if it was hot out, you go to that pool that was naked teenagers swimming and you could get laid pretty easily and then we would go and then we'd have to be there at 6:00 in the morning to park cars because the golfers and we get there and we had this little wooden shack and we'd run up and down the stairs, parking these cars because it was down a hill, so you'd have to drive it down the hill, run up, drive it down the hill for hours, and then finally they'd all be out on the golf course kickback in that shack

Speaker 4:          01:53:39       and just fucking lay on the wooden floor and sleep for a couple of hours. Working when you're tired and your kid is so important, so important to realize how to power through things. You don't power through shit when you're a little kid. Maybe they make you take naps. Quite the opposite of power and through. Yeah, like are you tired? Look, greg, just take a nap. You need to take in that we don't want to do. Go take a nap. Take a nap at school. Remember that? These have nap time in school. Then you'd take a nap when you got home and then all of a sudden no more naps. All of a sudden you have to work again. It happens over the course of like a couple of years. Yeah. Now I got to get up at six. Those summer jobs. Those were the big eyeopener for me. That's when I knew. That's when I fucking really knew I could never work instruction. That's when I really knew like summer jobs when I was in high school and right out of high school, so like, fuck

Speaker 5:          01:54:28       yeah, because I had just true. You should bust, you should make your kid bust his ass in high school so he can realize he needs an education or you need to pick something to do young. I

Speaker 4:          01:54:37       got to pick Something. Do different [inaudible]. I had other jobs that weren't as hard. Like I worked at newport creamery. I was a dishwasher and then I was a cook. Wasn't that hard? I mean, it sucked. It wasn't fun. Be cooked burgers, make ice cream sundaes and shit and milkshakes. And before that it was the guy wash the dishes. I moved up, gone up bro. I didn't want to take the waitress job though too much responsibility to be a waiter or waitress. Lipstick a perfectly good good. And those tights. But um, that was my only job that I'd had until I started doing construction jobs. Yeah. My dad's an architect. My stepdad got me gigs, he's an architect and he got me gigs in the summer, like, like real jobs. I was like, holy shit. Like when you're a labor, you're a 16 year old labor on a construction site. fuck your life. Fuck my life every day. Fuck your life. And plus I didn't know how to hydrate back down. I never drank any water and drank a coke in the morning and then all day, no drinking, whatnot. No awareness present already. Sunblock. Oh, it was

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       bronze, like copper. and I would just fucking carry shit all day and be so tired. But I remember thinking, okay, you got, there's gotta be a fucking plan. we got to make a plan to avoid this. Can't be doing this because you guys that would do this. My friend leroy got me a job once. This was a really important turning point. He and his friend hank, they would renovate buildings in dorchester. It's real shit neighborhood real bad and these buildings were like basically like completely wrecked and they would redo them. And this one guy, he was like semi homeless. He lived in this place while they were redoing it and he had a mountain dew jug, like a two liter thing of mountain dew that he filled with malt liquor and he would just drink this mountain dew jug of malt liquor all day. He'd be just blasted all day on the construction site and we're walking around.

Speaker 1:          01:56:32       IT's like exposed beams. There's a to the left and the right, there's fiberglass, you know, that's an overlap. Thus you could step through and you just drop right through the floor below. and this fucking guy walked like a ballerina drunk as fuck. His name is jeff. Never forget. Jeff walked around this, this construction site and just barely not stepping on nails, just barely and drunk and hammered and everybody knew it. Shakes his hands would shake, just hold the mountain leader, the two liter mountain dew thing and you fucking shake and while he's trying to drink a full on alkie and you were like, that's my future. I didn't think it was my future, but I knew it could be a future if you did what that guy's like, whoa. Yep, yep.

Speaker 3:          01:57:15       Yeah. You realize that. Uh, w with. I had a job, I was actually in college, but one summer I went out to the hamptons, me and my brother and this other guy from northern Ireland, sean, he was fucking drunk and we shared a studio apartment fully written. First two guYs in, got the foldout caps. THird guy was on the floor. So you'd try to fucking get home before the other guys with fleas. Fleas all summer. Did you guys have a dog? Did someone have a dog now? Somebody must have had a dog before the place was infested and I would go down. My job was I would ride my bike and I remember it was six miles. I would ride my bike to the beach and I had to get there at like 7:00 in the morning and it was an outdoor beach club. It was a bar.

Speaker 3:          01:58:01       Basically. Brooklyn would unload and show up at this place. It was called summers on dune road in the hamptons and they had to outdoor bars that each had six bartenders in it. Power, you know, power pouring, like fucking tom cruise and cocktail chicks in bikinis, bartending and then inside two more bars with six more bartenders, speakers the size of a fucking volkswagen. So I'd get there at 7:00 AM. My job was get the fucking dolly and get 10 speakers outside that were all the size of volkswagens, plug them in. First thing was do that. And then I put on 2001 space odyssey at nine to clear off all the drunks that were on the sand from the night before because you had to pay to get in. So theY wanted to clear the fucking beach. All these people get up screen with their hands on. Um,

Speaker 8:          01:58:50       a shot

Speaker 3:          01:58:58       and then I would carry up me and the other guy would carry up racks, you know, booze racks with like fucking 15 bottles in them, carry them up, stock each bar for six bartenders, start bringing up fucking garbage cans full of ice, filling up the trust with ice, bring it up. Cases of beer, stuff in the beers into the ice. I mean. And then. And then all of a sudden people started trickling in around 9:30, 10 cracked the fucking bad disco music, power pouring in the bikinis. Guido's showing up. Chicks that would, I would have to clean out the bathroom, the women's bathroom at least three times a day. It'd be clogged up with tampons. These nasty fucking guido chicks from brooklyn, which stick their bloody tampons. And there would be. And then the men would throw fucking broken bottles into the urinals. I'd have to clean those out all day long up and down.

Speaker 3:          01:59:49       And the ice was down a flight of stairs with a broken down shitty ice machine. And all day long I weighed a hundred and 25 pounds up and down the stairs with buckets of ice on my shoulder cases. A coRe is light and just fry and it was all outside. So I was getting fried from the sun. And I'm thinking, this is great. I'm going to get laid. I didn't get a fucking conversation with one of those chicks all summer long. All I did was drink miller lites and then a few times a day I'd run down to the beach, dive in the ocean and fucking cool off come back. But I made bank. These bartenders, they knew I was taking care of them and they were day. We're making thousand dollars a day. Really? Yeah. They were making crazy money and they would all tip me as fucking 15 Bartenders.

Speaker 3:          02:00:38       All tip and who is three of us, me and two other guys. And then I get on my bike at around 6:00 and I pedaled back to our little flea infested studio apartment and then take a shower. And then we go to this place to kill a murphy's up the street and we'd dance fucking dance to like, you know, rob base and dj eez rock the art of noise and we and I would break dance and we'd stay there till two in the morning and I'd come home and get some more flea bites, get up and do it all over again every day.

Speaker 4:          02:01:16       I had fleas in my carpet when I was in high school because of that same dog got hit by a car and we didn't have fleas anymore after just died. I put carpet shit down, vacuumed it. But one time I brought this chick home when I was still living with my parents and she's one of the chicks that I ever brought on. But like I think I was 18 at the time was still living at home and she was 18 to. And she knew how to fuck.

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       Like not just allie, she was the first girl I ever had sex with that put her foot on the wall. It was like pushing off with their foot on the wall. Like I lived on the second floor. And you know, uh, some bedrooms have an angled wall where my bed was, it was propped up against the side of the wall, so it was like a flat wall up to like, you know, three feet high. And then above that there was like this angle and this chick put our foot on the top of that. And she was like, fucking up and pushed back. Yeah. I remember thinking jesus, like respect. Like she wasn't just taking it. She was, she was given it back from the bottom. And I was like, I've never dated a girl did that before because you know, when you're 16 you're dating 16 year olds, 17 year by the time you're 18 girls been fucking for awhile. They know what they're doing, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:02:28       I remember he had been around that age. I remember this girl, linda, I won't say her last name, she reached down. I'm fucking her. and she reaches down and starts rubbing her clit. And I was like, whoa. I was like, wow, this is about your orgasm, isn't it? Huh? That's a girls ready to party. Because when you. There's a certain age where it goes from becoming about your orgasm to being about hers, you know, and that's, that's a big, big, big primordial change. There's also like this thing where girls doing that in front of you, there's something really hot

Speaker 1:          02:02:59       about it. Like she wants you to fuck her while she's masturbating and looking at you and like letting you know that she's masturbating like whoa, it's full surrender. Yeah. But this girl that pushed off against the wall, she got flea bites, overlooked my fucking my carpet and fucking fleas on it. And she was like, what the fuck? I was like, ah. I gotta do something about it. some mattamy. I used to have like little bites all over my fucking ankles all the time. Yeah, just thing you had, if you had a dog back then you know, like we take some powder, a spray or sprinkle some fucking powder and then vacuum is supposed to kill the fleas never killed most of them. There's a few gangster fleas. It would survive. And your dog would always get them. They go outside, they're just get fleas.

Speaker 3:          02:03:43       Did he have you had those bugs right now because it was so rainy this winter. We got these. They look like giant mosquitoes, but they're like five times as big as mosquitoes. Mosquito eaters. Yeah. They're all over the mosquito ears, right? They always seem to sting you. They don't seem to sting, but you open your front door, man. They come right in there every night I got to kill a couple of in the house. Do they really eat mosquitoes? I don't know how you would get days. They're so slow. I don't know how they would get to a mosquito. Maybe the mosquito would be stupid and be like, dad, like, yeah, I can give you a hug. Yeah. I mean I heard them called that, but I was thinking the same thing, like how the fuck are. They don't. Crane flies are actually physically incapable of killing mosquitoes. The main sustenance

Speaker 1:          02:04:26       of crane flies is flower nectar. The nickname mosquito eaters probably comes to the fact that some larval cream fleas feed on mosquito larva, but it also is only occasionally

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       and those things. I mean it's the size of Your hand. They're big. Yeah, it's a weird bug. YeAh, there's a lot of uh, and mosquitoes too. There's a ton of mosquitoes right now. We got a wet winter. It's fascinating. You know what's funny though is people are so glass half empty. I've been here so many people go, wow, there's going to be a real problem in the summer when fire season starts. Got all this bitch. Can you just enjoy the green hills? The hills are green. It looks beautiful. Yeah. I hope it keeps. I hope this place become seattle and people move. I hope it rains constantly and they move la to like the desert move into like where area 51 is. This is where we're going to film from now on. Guys start filming out there because it never rains. Yeah. I just read this book about the making of the Panama canal and they talk about, you know, when the french, the french first tried to do it.

Speaker 3:          02:05:27       They went in in the late 19th century and they, you know, you gotta think technology in the late 19th century. They didn't have fucking electricity. They didn't have shit. They had giant machines and they were trying to bulldoze a canal through the most dense tropical jungle that you could get through and, and they, and they lost something like 20 percent of the people that went down there, died of malaria and yellow fever, which are both mosquito borne diseases. So they go down there and they fight it out for like 10 years. They keep sending people down to keep dying, keep sending people down to keep dying. And uh, and even if you don't die, you're working 14 hour days in jungle heat with a fucking, with a little spade. And then all of a sudden they'd get a monster rain and everything you'd excavated, there'd be a mudslide.

Speaker 3:          02:06:23       It would fill it right up again. They'd start all over. There were snakes, there was fucking mountain lions and they just finally gave up. Finally, France just went, fuck this. They had bled hundreds of millions of dollars. And so and so. Then the us stepped in. I go, we can do it. So we came in and some guy had realized that mosquitoes were the problem like that. Nobody knew that. Malaria and yellow fever. We're mosquito where mosquito born for whatever reason, they just thought it was fucking popping out out of the dirt. They thought it was like fumes coming out of the dirt and this guy's like, no, it's fucking mosquitoes. So he came in with a team of like 10 people and they just started in educating people about how to get rid of mosquitoes, which is basically get rid of standing water. And so instead of having mud roads, they poured concrete and uh, and instead of having open barrels that people will collect rainwater and they would put sheets over them and a fucking god. That's it. That's all he had to do to stop. No deaths from malaria and yellow fever. After the first couple of years they started construction. That's incredible. Yeah. They just figured out a

Speaker 4:          02:07:35       way to stop the mosquitoes from breeding without poison, without poison. That's incredible. I would have thought they would just agent orange the fuck out of that place. Just standing water. Wow. Do you know malaria has killed half the people that have ever died ever? No shit. Wow. Wow. Half the people that have ever done ever in the history of the human race of dying from malaria and still unabated, no fucking cure. My friend. Justin's got it at three times. Really? Where's he live? Well, he goes to the Congo, makes wells for the pygmies, justin wren. But if you catch it and you take the pill right away, you're fine. If you get the proper medication, you will be okay. But there's a bunch of different strains of malaria and some of them last a long time and he's had one strain where he got it.

Speaker 4:          02:08:25       He recovered from It and then he got sick and because he got sick, the malaria came back, so he got an unrelated illness without being around the mosquitoes and malaria came back and he had to figure it out that the malaria had made a relapse. So he's had it three times, two times from being bitten one time from a relapse. So is malaria something that just stays with you for life? I think with some cases, and not just. Not necessarily for live, but it can recur over the course of a certain amount of years. And then your body eventually gets over it, but he was saying that one case of malaria, you can have it for as much as 30 years.

Speaker 3:          02:08:57       Wow. And dying of it is about as painful as it gets. Your brain starts to fucking fry. You just go crazy. Your entire body feels like it's made of acid. It's brutal. Fuck yeah. Fuck. You know. And you think about how, you know, third world, you know, we're trying to do good in the world. Malaria is just number one, two and three that we should be focusing on.

Speaker 4:          02:09:23       Yeah. There was some work that they were doing, um, kind of want to say somewhere around California, someone was doing it where they were trying to figure out a way to engineer a mosquito that does not get malaria. And they were going to release that mosquito. Oh yeah. Yeah. I heard about this. Is that what it was? Well, I think it happened with zika virus. Malaria really kill half the people that ever lived get the facts. Did it?

Speaker 3:          02:09:50       Oh, it doesn't matter. It's definitely probably one of the biggest throughout human history. But to actually know the actual fact if it has killed that many people, it's probably not because it would have had to kill it at an average of five and a half million per year. And for like the last 30 or 40 years, it's only about two to $3 million. So that number, 30 or 40 years? At least 20 percent. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:10:10       so, but they don't know. So where does it come from? Does any. There's any site support that this site tries to debunk it. We have to be sure that they're not right. Because I feel like I read it from a science paper, which might not necessarily look. Look, we had rob wolf the other day and he thought that the vomitorium was really. Some people make mistakes, but it's a, it's killed fuck loads of people. it's just there's a lot of those god disease. It scared the shit out of you. Like remember when the ebola crisis happened and everybody was panicking that a bullet made its way to the United States. Remember that one lady, she was a nurse. She was in quarantine and they, they tried to keep from quarantine. She's like, fuck you. I'm going shopping. That's right. Yeah. So like, bitch, you're quarantined. I don't Have it.

Speaker 4:          02:10:50       Well, this zika thing is not under under wraps. They've got it here. It's down in floridA. And uh, I think that they, I know they were trying to genetically modify mosquitoes for zika. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a friend of mine. His wife got pregnant. It wouldn't, wouldn't let her go anywhere. so like we were supposed to go to Hawaii or maybe Mexico or something like that, that they were like, fuck that. Yeah. We're not taking any chances. I'm gonna stay right here while this kid's born. Fuck yeah. Because it, it's incurable and your kid develops a tiny head and it's a really creepy. They don't even know what else happens because they're, you know, the kids that are born from it are only a few years old at this point. Fucking crazy disease. That's so cruel. So horrible. There's a guy named Peter Cortez that I, uh, interviewed once and he was talking to me about, um, it was for my saifai, sheila did years back and he was talking to me about, um, jungle diseases like people that have, um, you know, any sort of infestations of parasites and things like that in the jungle.

Speaker 4:          02:11:47       And he said it is 100 percent of the people that lived there. They have the 100 percent of the people that live there have something. Yeah. One hundred percent. I went 100 percent. Does that mean they're living with it or they're suffering from it? They're living with it. I mean, they might be suffering from it, but one of them was, um, this cat parasite toxoplasma. Have you ever heard of that? Oh yeah. I'm pregnant. Women are super dangerous for women to like, handle cat shit because of it. You shouldn't touch a litter box or eat any vegetables in France because they don't. Uh, my friend, my wife went to France when she was pregnant and they said that she couldn't eat cheese because they don't pass her eyes it out correctly. And France. Well, it makes sense. They like that raw stinky cheese down there. They love that stuff, they love it, but it, um, it's a weird one because it makes the rat, when a rat eats it or rat gets it into its body, a rap become sexually attracted to the smell cat urine to the point where their dick gets hard and their ball swell up and they go find the cat and the cat kills him.

Speaker 4:          02:12:47       And then the cat relays it to people. And one of the things it does with people, it makes him reckless. So there's a direct. There's a guy named Dr. Roberts polsky at, uh, stanford who's done extensive research on toxoplasma is fucking fascinating. Guys get some awesome speeches where he talks about it online, but one of the things they found when he was working in the er is a direct correlation between toxo plasma and motorcycle accidents. Like a lot of these people, they're really people that would come in and they would have motorcycle accidents. They would test them and they would find out they tested positive for toxo. $50. Million people in America tested positive for toxo plasma brielle yep. And it, it affects the way you think, it affects your judgment and makes you more impulsive, makes you more aggressive. And it might even affect women.

Speaker 4:          02:13:34       It might make women more promiscuous or at least make them more um, sexually submissive. They don't know. I mean, this is just a complete total speculation, but they think it might be one of the reasons why some south american countries are very macho and the women are like very sexy. So why did we win with cats? Always live alone. I don't think it's the same, but those cats never leave the house. So. So if you don't have a cat, you can't catch this. No, you can catch it. You can catch it from the meat of a cow that eats the cat shit and it's in its grass. Like there's a bunch of different ways. A lot of people currently, there's probably 50 Million people in the country that have this currently in America. There's 50 million people plus that are infected with this parasite called toxoplasmosis. Should you geT tested for it then?

Speaker 4:          02:14:17       I probably have it for sure. I'm scared. I don't want to get tested because you have cats, right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm definitely. I'm joey diaz has 150,000 fucking cats. He's for sure. Got it. All those crazy cat ladies are guarantee you they have. Yeah. Yeah. It's a really common thing. I think in France at one point there was something like 30 percent of the population had talked, so. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's real. Well, we have feral cats. Is that a bacteria then? It's a parasite. It's so sort of a parasite that actually gets its way into your brain because that's the crazy thing is what I forget what percentage of your body weight is bacteria, but it's staggering nuts. Charge 15 percent of your body weight is bacteria. Yeah. We're. We're all you need to the steps. See how full of shit. I mean, first of all, find out how many people in America have toxoplasma before we find that approximately $30.

Speaker 4:          02:15:05       Million. Thirty dollars million. Wow. It says it's the number. See bright $50 million. See if I. I don't remember that wrong, right? 50 million people in America have talks with one of them died. Oh my god, I don't think it kills you on a motorcycle wreck. Motorcycles. But [inaudible] was, um, he was, uh, studying it's effects on people and trying to figure out like they don't really know what it does to people. There's just this correlation between motorcycle accident. Another thing that says up to 60 million people could have it so makes that a million people just in America, just in America, in other countries, like in some south american countries, it's very high. And uh, you know, it might've been just something that people been living with forever. It's just, there's some sort of a weird connection that we have to these organisms. And in this one it rewires the sexual reward system of rodin's changes the reward system. It makes their dick hard for cat piss so that they go near the cat. So they get killed. So they can transmit it to people because cats hanging around with people. I mean, assuming that that's the, the chain of events. Yeah, fucking a man. Jesus, look at that one to three percent of the body's mass in a 200 pound adults is two to six pounds of bacteria, but also play a vital role in human health. Wow. Human body contains trillions of microorganisms. Outnumbering human cells by 10 to one,

Speaker 4:          02:16:32       so three percent of the body's mass, but they outnumber human cells just because of the size, because they're small size. However, the micro organisms make up only one to three percent of the body's mass. it doesn't make as much of the mass, but you are outnumbered. Human cells are outnumbered 10 to one. That's like if there's every one rap for every person on a ship and there's 10 people, think of that. I mean, that's a fucking infested rat filled ship. Some of the bacteria is good. Some of it is. Yeah, but I'm just saying you're mostly rats. He feels like. What does that a ship of people? Well, there's some people on it. It's mostly rats. I mean, it's mostly fucking ratchet. So we are. I mean, if you had a 100 people, a thousand rats on a ship, which say that's a ship full of people or ship full of rats.

Speaker 4:          02:17:22       I say it's a ship full of rats and pour a bunch of poor fuckers trying to get some sleep. Yeah, we're just bags of bacteria. We're bags of bacteria and we don't understand a lot of it because it is. It's so fucking small and it's mysterious. Well, how about probiotics? That's how recent is that where people figured out that you have to take in healthy bacteria in your body every day? Two decades, three decades. I meAn, when did you figure that out? When do people start taking probiotics? You take them every day, right? Yeah. I'd taken a live form. I'd like mostly in. I like to eat either kimchi or sauerkraut. I do that and in kombucha drink kombucha everyday. How you did stuff. Oh, I love it. Yeah. I always keep it here too. If you want one. Wow. We always have it here. I drink that.

Speaker 4:          02:18:06       The real stuff that you have to have an id to show the gts kombucha as the shit because it's over one half of one percent alcohol and you can't get drunk but one half to one percent alcohol. You have to be 21 to buy it. Oh, it's that strong over one half of one percent and it's made out of like dairy, right? It's like raw dairy. No, no, no, no. That's key for. That's a different thing you're thinking of a key for is like a green. It was green involved to somehow. I don't understand really how kiefer's made somebody explained it to me and I just blanked out, but it's a fungus. It's kind of like a fungus. It's a growth, some sort of a thing. Kombucha. Yeah. I just didn't make it. I used to make it really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. When I first came to la, I actually, this girl I was dating got me a piece.

Speaker 4:          02:18:49       She got me like a live organism. She told me how to do it and you'd get like a bowl, like a glass bowl, like one of the big punch bowls and you fill the bowl up with sugar and water and I forget what the other ingredients are, but you stirred all in, make it dissolve and then you put the fungus in there and then you put it in the frigerator or you leave it on the counter. I don't remember. What much fungus do you think to leave it on the counter? You just put a good chunk. Yeah. You know you have like a piece of this stuff and the longer you let it ferment, the stronger the kombucha is going to be. And then I would take it in. I would pour it into like this big bucket and then drink it and I was like, it's too much of a pain in the ass because you couldn't buy it anywhere back then.

Speaker 4:          02:19:27       The only way you can get it in 1994, unless you knew some like super hippie health food store that sold it most of the time you got it from other people and I was like, does this even work? Like doing what am I even doing? So it's even good for you. But I was like, oh, she might be right. Wow. A kombucha everyday. everyday, everyday you have that. Or sauerkraut or kimchi. Sauerkraut to. I love sauerkraut. Raw sauerkraut, but kimchis huge, super high in probiotics. It's like fermented cabbage. So it's all like organisms in it. Yeah, it's almost shit growing. My stomach feels distended and somebody told me that the probiotics can help, that. There's probably a lot of bacteria in there. It could be. Would you drink a do take in a lot of sugar? Pasta or pasta? That's sugar unfortunately. Yeah, I know and I, I've tried to take a fucking bagel every morning and then I try to never have pasta, but unfortunately all that fucking yummy, delicious shit.

Speaker 4:          02:20:25       Like every now and then I'll let myself have like a giant pastrami sub. Yeah. Well, you know, Italian bread, mustard and swiss cheese and I love it, but you feel like shit afterwards because your body has to process all that sugar. Right? All that bread is terrible for you. So you just eat vegetables and meat for the most part. I mean I fuck around. I don't. I don't have a totally strict diet. I have a mostly strict diet. You eat rice sometimes? Most of the time, no, but sometimes like I'm having sushi. I'm like, fuck it, let's live more. But if I'm not feeling that, I'll either appeal the sushi off of the. Off of the rice have succeeded. Like sashimi. Yeah, but I'll eat like one out of every three. I'll eat the rice. Just gotta. If you're on a diet where your body's fat adapted, if it's burning off fat, as soon as you tip the scales and you have too many carbohydrates, it's like fuck it.

Speaker 4:          02:21:21       We're going back to carbohydrates. Then you get tired. Easy. You get hungry. Easy. It's like it. It fucks with the system. Once you start getting that fat adapted state and it's hard when you're out to eat a decent lunch that doesn't have carbs in it, everything's a fucking sandwich. Salads, salads, chicken salads and salmon. Salmon is really good. It's cutting oils in it. Healthy oils. Ask them for olive oil, pour the olive oil on the salad. Nothing wrong with balsamic vinegarette either, but uh, you know, most salad dressings are bullshit. Yeah. Most salad dressings, just nonsense and sugar. And you drink, like if you have like a delicious french dressing, like why thing? It's delicious. It's fucking desert. Yeah. You're eating dessert, dessert, ketchup that you pour over your salad or my kid eats fucking granola bars all day and I'm like, dude, that's a candy bar. Yep. it's just sugar. It doesn't seem like. It seems like you're eating oats and all healthy and shit. You just as better off eating a snickers bar. Yeah. Same shit. I'm kinda. What about fruit? Somebody? Somebody told me that not all fruit is good to eat because it's got too much sugar. Well, fruIt of today we have to really realize when everybody's

Speaker 1:          02:22:25       using these terms. Gmo, and this is something I've looked into pretty heavily and I had this guy kevin folta on my podcast as a food scientist and he's kind of explaining while people have a lot of misguided misconceptions about gmo foods, he's like, essentially everythIng's gmo, like everything has been in some way or another modify that you're eating, whether it's tomatoes that have been modified to stay on the shelf longer, whether it's oranges or modified to be far more juicy and delicious than they've ever been in the past. Apples, they're like, we're talking about apples was like old. Somebody else was just talking about this recently, who was. I don't remember if I looked it up. there are thousands of different apples that didn't pull it up to that podcast, but there's only like five now. Thousands of different. Was it? Rob was rob. Rob.

Speaker 1:          02:23:07       Hello, rob. Rob wolf is a biologist. I'm pretty is. What the fuck is his bio? Bio. Fucking something. Some scientists character. Really smart guy, but he was explaining that they all used to be like crab apples. They'll still be like kind of sour and you can eat them. You remember crab apples when you were a kId. We throw them at each other, throw them at cars. There are little tiny things. Green and they were salary shit. You could eat them, you'd eat them if you're really hungry, but most of the time you wouldn't eat them. Yeah, that's what apparently with apples used to be. Those were wild apples and people if I just take that and I don't know how they do it, but they figured out how to splice things and change things and selectively breed certain plants and they came up with different strains. That's why corn looks the way it looks. Old school corn was like the size of a hobos dick and it was so naughty and fucked up look and it was like four inches long. So it's A little tiny thing. It tastes the same. No, I mean it's a hobos dick. No, hobos dicks are weird, man. They're so variable.

Speaker 4:          02:24:09       You never know what you get. And it could be a recent hobo and be like, that guy who punched you. Just old school, not blowing veteran. His dick tastes like battery acid addict. That's been through the pacific southwest for guys just doing nothing all day and he comes in your mouth. What do you think that tastes? Because if they say that like a guide drinks orange juice has come, tastes better. Have you heard that? Yeah. Whenever I heard that, I was like, how many dicks do you have to suck for you figure that out. You can get away from me.

Speaker 4:          02:24:40       Do you hold it with your fucking scientist? He's sucking dick with a lab coat on. Taking notes. My asparagus not recommended. Switching it around in your mouth like you're a wine connoisseur, right? If a guy eats pineapples, pineapples is cum. Tastes better, but conversely, if you just knew it nothing but smoking meth, your loads have to taste like hot death. Yeah. And it does. And it's fucking lumpy. Pesticide loads. Tastes like roundup. It's not good when you have to kill it. Not much either. It's like a fuckinG hershey's kiss swollen. I had shit, motherfucker. Fuck. She's immediately tripping on meth. She's out of her mind. Do you remember when that actor fuck's his name? Tom sizemore. When tom sizemore went off the rails. Yeah, and did a porn. I'm like, they would play his, his thing on opie and anthony all the time because when he was coming he was like, oh, mother fucker, just a cracked out load.

Speaker 4:          02:26:02       There's nothing like a car, like the sound of a man orgasm. When he knows he's just off the rails is off the rails on math making a porn. It was in saving private ryan. Here he is. That's his primal as it gets. It's like the pure id being expressed. Just fuck it. Can you play it? No. Can't even show you this legal fee to play the audience. Show this. He was a madman. He was a madman. Wait, how do you decide which clips here? Lead to play tit on that, so yeah, we can get it away. Get it off, get it off, get off, get off the screen here on the screen. I met him a long time ago. I did a show on vh one called the list. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that. The host of it, I got to. You are the host of the list.

Speaker 4:          02:26:49       I was a hope, one of the, and they wrote, they rotated, rotated, so I think I did two, maybe three episodes, but one of them was I got to meet rob halford. I got to meet rick james. James was a macro, didn't do none of them kids. He was like, we were talking about it and one of the gals from baywatch was on the show as well, and she was a mom. God, I can't remember her name, but very, very pretty girl. Her name mary to nikki sixx. No, I don't think so. I don'T remember which one she was. Anyway, very nice girl. Gina something or another. Anyway, um, she was, it came up in some way, shape or form and she was like, I don't buy it. I don't buy it. And he's like, michael didn't do nothing to them. Kids might go there And do nothing then that's all bullshit imitation.

Speaker 4:          02:27:36       I'm asking all bullshit. And rick james had been out partying all night. So when he showed up, like we were warned that he might not be able to do it. Like he got there and they, you could tell he just been up, you knoW, he's like, I'm, I'm suffering from some sort of a cold, so if I can't do this, I can't do this. And we were like, hey man, do what you can do to do. But he went down and went out there and plow through like a trooper. Wow. Yeah. But uh, he was defended Michael Jackson. Margaret didn't do nothing but michael, what's his face? Tom sizemore came on and he had fucking slippers on. He had like, slippers and fucking bathrobe. I don't remember what he wore when he sat down, but I remember he showed up with slippers and a bathrobe and he was just right when he was just going off the rails right when he was going.

Speaker 4:          02:28:20       It was supposed be him and val kilmer. Val kilmer was out partying all night and then he was with him and he's just like, val. Karen was like, fuck it, I'm not going. So like last val kilmer was going to do the list. Yes. Falcon one was off the rails. Don't remember when val kilmer got huge fat and went crazy. That's right. He did a play and we did a play for awhile and it was like, what the fuck is val kilmer doing? Party in? He was just going off. It was just having fun and it was during that time, that size more showed up. It was a very nice guy. Super nice guy. Math. Huh? I don't know what he was doing. Who's doing a bunch of shit, but then he wound up on celebrity rehab member. Uh, okay. Oh, that's right. Yeah. Several seasons.

Speaker 4:          02:28:58       Was he? Oh yeah. Oh, that's right. He was on with heidi fleiss. Like heidi fleiss was like his girlfriend. That fucking celebrity rehab show. Could you iMagine if you try to do that today? They don't do it anymore. Now it's, you're exploitinG people's. The worst time you could ever have someone in front of cameras when they're at their most vulnerable. Yeah. They are recovering from addiction. Do you don't think that that's an impediment to recovery and putting them on camera, following cameras around them while they're trying to detox and figure the fucking life out. And you're giving them massive amounts of attention. You're putting long shooting schedules. You got lav mics on them and she started having an affair. As you encourage it, when you're supposed to discourage it is crazy. It's everything that aa is not. It's the opposite of anonymous. You ever hear doug stand helps bid on it.

Speaker 4:          02:29:44       Now doug stanhope tortured dr drew really tortured him and he's 100 percent right? Yeah. Like look, they allowed that to happen. Dr. Drew figured like, look, I'm a competent doctor. I'll take care of it. I'll make sure everything's fine. At least it'll expose. Like you could rationalize it, it will expose to people what it's like to go through this. And you see celebrities and movie stars going through this. But a lot of it wasn't celebrities and movie stars. It was like sorta celebrities like angie dickinson where there's some guy on the show with some young guy was in brother. Oh, it was ian. I think so. I shouldn't say that. Julia roberts. Eric roberts was on. Well as he and he was on for, for Pot. It was hilarious. So fucked up. This dude's he's got a newspaper out, he's drinking coffee, good morning Shakes, throw shitting themselves, sweating through the night.

Speaker 4:          02:30:34       He's like going through zero withdrawals. He's literally reading the times over a cup of coffee with his feet up on the beach during the ballot booth somewhere in some serene environment too is like when you go to these rehabs, that shit is expensive and it's like a resort. You're getting like you're going to do yoga. Then you do a meditation. Maybe you get a fucking massage. You drinking all like green green blended drinks and be well. Who's paying for it? All the people that didn't have all the fun partying. I'm think you're paying for it now for the state only pays for so much right now, but I mean say you say your brother gets all fucked up. You sent him to rehab. You're paying for it. Oh, that's the worst.

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       If you have a brother that's a coke addict and you have safety, you have a family and your wife's like, you're not fucking paid for it, greg. Yeah, he's gotta. Get his shit together. The fucking we need that money for johnny's college. Yeah. My brother is the fourth time. He's gotten fucked up in two years.

Speaker 4:          02:31:37       And then your wife's like, let's just kill him. Let's just kill them. You know, you're probably some fucking loser. I want to kill him. Let's take him to boston university life insuranCe. Not only we get rid of him like a bucks on the backend. Rocky brother. Let's take them fishing club. Moved ahead. Throw them in the ocean

Speaker 2:          02:31:54       godfather style. How many people have done that? How many people were killed? Loved ones I thought were losers just for a life insurance policy. Oh, all the time. All the time. Yeah. I feel like if you could see like the numbers of how many people have killed loved ones for money.

Speaker 4:          02:32:09       Oh my.

Speaker 2:          02:32:12       Yeah. I mean they, that's what that whole a dark internet is about, you know, getting a hitman to take as your husband. That's why my. I got a $1,000,000 insurance policy for my wife anymore than that. She fucking wants me gone. That's a good point. 1 million lets her get. Get her shit together to show you. Don't have to pay taxes on that anymore. That's one thing for the key is you set up a shell, liKe we have a shell that it would pay into. WhAt I'm thinking is actually inheritance tax, inheritance tax. Like if your kids inherited your money right there, like if you left your kids $500,000, your kids would have to pay off half of that to the government. So they really would only get 2:15. The government uncle sam like. Yeah, like my gut. That's right. To take my cat. I like to whip my bake.

Speaker 2:          02:32:59       Meanwhile trump's right. He's like, well this is fucked up because that money's already been taxed. LIke somebody earned that money is given to you as a gift when they die. Like you shouldn't have to pay. It's not earned income. First of all, it's only over one point $8,000,000 for a couple. And my feeling is one point 8 million. What do you mean that's the. You don't pay any inheritance tax under one point $8,000,000. Yeah. So to me it feels like the framers of the constitution had come from europe where money had been handed down through generations, aristocracies useless, wasteful, dangerous motherfuckers, and when they set up the constitution, they said we need to have an estate tax to try to keep the money from all ending up in the hands of a few families and so I'm all for it. I think then if you end up with more than one point $8,000,000 a year, kids are set as well as their educations will be set.

Speaker 2:          02:33:51       That's a down payment on a house and then let them earn their fucking way. That's a good point. Actually. I never thought about that way. You know what I didn't think actually honestly as weird as that or did think rather than that I have the problem with is the money's going to go to the government. That's the problem is where does the money go? Yeah. It'd be one thing if you had inheritance tax and it went towards a worthwhile charity, like should be able to pick. You should be able to pick your chair. Right? Absolutely. That's the way to do it. Well, instead of giving it to the government and they spend as they wish, they didn't even have to have a fucking receipt. You don't have to have an audit of what they do. Well, you look at what warren buffett is doing now, he's giving it away before he dies.

Speaker 2:          02:34:26       That's what you gotta do. If you want to control where it goes, give it away. Save a couple million because that's what your kids will get and fucking give the rest away the way you wanT to. He's basically given it all away. Ninety nine percent of it. That's so insane. This documentary about him. That's really crazy. I mean this guy like he literally lives in the same house he bought when he first moved to omaha, Nebraska. And how's that possible? Like how? Who watches his house? like people must want to kidnap him all the time. He stays right there on the street. They'd fucking show a picture of it because you have like guards. No, come on. He drives to the same mcdonald's every morning does he? And he either gets an egg mcmuffin with sausage and the egg mcmuffin with bacon depending on as the stock market is up or down.

Speaker 2:          02:35:08       Oh jesus. And he. He knows the exact. He goes, It's a dollar 68. I have that exact amount of money. He's fucking nuts. He's like really? Just flies commercial. Yeah, he takes coach seats were I think sell jesus christ. drives a fucking car. It's, I dunno, there's an old, but it's like nothing. It's enough in car. Maybe people don't believe he's that rich and that's why they don't rob him. I think he's like the fifth richest person in the world or something. Well, I think public person. I think the real issue is like those saudi arabian arab prince dudes don't have to report their income. I'll make that oil cash son. Yeah. Make that deep oil cash. Send their kids to New York city. They're live in fucking five floors of an apartment building. What was the thing you were telling me before the race? Before the podcast started about erik prince, who used to be the head of blackwater. There's some new store that just broke out about the United Arab Emirates. Oh, right. I'm arranging some sort of thing when they were setting up, so some, some back what they call backwater communication between trump and a major russian official who's got close tieS to putin and the black water guy who was orchestrating the deal. It'S in a. it's in the waShington post right now. And it's saying it happened on july. Fake news had happened the first week of january, right before, right before he took office.

Speaker 9:          02:36:36       Yes.

Speaker 2:          02:36:38       Back channel in some island. The specialists islands. So they met there. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:36:48       So who met someone from the administration? This guy, Eric Prince. Right. Who's the founder of blackwater, doeS not get much more evil than that. Well, he had, they changed the name to something else and then he moved to, I think the United Arab Emirates. I was shamed like the security guy for the united arab emirateS. Uh, yeah. they're like essentially have their own army of high level mercenaries. They were meeting and to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria. I think what happened with the Eric Prince guy is that once The arab spring shit started going down, some of those super rich guys are like, uh, yeah, it's uh, it's fucking not, have this happen over here. Yeah, let's, let's put together a serious strategy. And so they went with that guy. Wow. So much. So much money. Well, who knows how much money they have that someone told me they have trillions, but I don't know if that is that documented.

Speaker 2:          02:37:50       I don't know what's the richest person in the world is not like the richest public person, like the richest public person used to be bill gates and then with some mexican, a telecom guy. Yeah, I remember that dude. Yeah. But it's also, um, it's, I think the money iS spread out through these royal families and none of the money goes to the saudis. You know, the, the citizens now they don't get any of it. There's these rural families that have fucking hundreds of members and the money all gets filtered throughout the family. Crazy. And they each have nine kids. And what's crazy is that that didn't use to be the case too. Like what the fifties or sixties, like whenever they establish these, these emPires, is that right kind of money. They weren't getting oil out of there. Once they started getting oil out of there, they just debt like you ever seen the growth of dubai over the past 30 years? Like a timelapse images of the growth. The islands. Sandbars make Ireland. Yeah. They make their own islands and they have an ocean break to stop. The islands were getting swamped, but one of the major does a huge high rise on one of the islands. It just sank like five feet into the fucking sand. Oh my god. Oh my god. They built a high rise on sand. Oh my god. Yeah. I just keep sinking. It's going to go lease leaning tower pieces.

Speaker 2:          02:39:13       What do they do? TaMales. Shit. You know they bring girls from the us over. They're hollow from Russia. They say you want it from Russia. but I hear, I hear stories about us girls to go with it and get that paper. They think they're going to go get a little a paper going to date. One guy. You're going to date a whole family. Will you ever heard what the Salt number nine, how he used to rock it now? he used to have a disco in his house and he would pay these girls extraordinary amounts of money. Stay there for months at a time. He'd have like 50 of them there and he would just come down and go, you, let's do it. And he would just come down the disco just fucking slide down the railing and his gold underwear and just start dancing last, pick one and throw the dick to her and then go, I'll see you in a week or so. And then they would just stick around and do whatever they had to do. They'd go to the gym, workout, get their toes done, and he'd pick a new one all the time. Wow. He just had so much money. He just. One prostitute was like, he, that's not good enough. Yeah. I want girls who are not prostitutes to Become prostitutes. Yeah. So he just went deep. What about melania trump? How dare you? That's the first landing son of a bitch. It's equal pay day, bro.

Speaker 2:          02:40:27       She's going To have the equal pay. When she divorced, she's waiting to divorce that motherfucker. you know that she doesn't even want to live with them. She doesn't want to live with him. Listen, our son, he's only 10. Can't kick him out of the school. He's got to stay in the school. 10 year olds can't move. They can't move. They can't move to Washington to be near a dad who grabs women's pussies and admits it or who's the president? Someone said something really funny. I forget who it was. they said, is that the first lady or is that a flight attendant on the first flight to mars?

Speaker 4:          02:41:00       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:41:00       she's a. She's living with a lot of mixed feelings. Looking a ring that fucking ring could lord. She grew up in a fucking mud town in eastern europe. To that ring is insane. That ring is like, how much does that ring worth? let's, I guess let's say you guys, because I'm sure it's on the internet. I would say her ring is worth $5,000,000 with 20. Really $20,000,000. Find out. Find out young. Jamie got bold as fuck right there. I hope you noticed that. Alyssa milano calls out. What is she calling out? Melania trump's giant diamond rings and official portrait. Why is he calling out the rings? What? C'mon alyssa. Which she's getting mad at some blood diamonds. She didn't. Is that what it is? Twenty five to $3,000,000 rang. I'm so wrong. What did you pick? I said five. It's 25 parents. Five carat. So what is milana? What's her problem? I can handle it. I heard melania met donald on fuck island, which is one of these islands real. He had a bring a eastern european women there and then billionaires shell up and they all just fuck. We've got to get richard. Dude,

Speaker 4:          02:42:19       you want to go to fuck. I've got to get an invite. If it all goes sour, we're going to block fuck island. If it all goes wrong, your wife leaves you mind.

It's just like, dude, what are you doing on tuesday? You want to go to fuck island? All right. He'll go to fuck island, dude. We'd be bar backs on fuck islands. We'd be hoping that they would be able to click all we have to. We worked there. We get a job there. I'll carry the ice. You carry the beer. Come on dude. We're definitely gonna

Speaker 2:          02:42:51       duh, duh.

Speaker 4:          02:42:56       You and me on fuck island drinking miller lite on the beach going. We've got to get out of here. They took our passports though. Fuck.

Speaker 2:          02:43:04       We'd be laying down the real dick because he's billionaires can't fuck when these. When would to be getting horny after awhile. Think so these billionaires are

Speaker 4:          02:43:11       on viagra and meth and they're just slamming it in. They probably have helmets on like exoskeletons and make them fuck harder. Like some sort of an artificial spine that connects at the shoulders like a football outfit. And you hear the hydraulic while they're just slamming it in its viagara meth fueled dick to get a doctor. That's right. They're taking vitals at all times. Like they just have enough viagara so their their veins pump up so fat and thick that they almost black out. It's like a fine line. You've got to get them to write to the edge whether they're seeing those here we get punched and you see stars. They see those stars while they're fucking almost going out, right?

Speaker 4:          02:43:54       That's what they're doing and then when they come they just throw them oxygen mask on him and rub their feet and they come. They throw the girl right off the yacht here spent. She's like a cartridge and they he's on the girls were flood because they know it's coming. They swim to shore. They collect their check. They get on a plane. They don't say shit. They don't say, that's just a day. Clean out the undercarriage and centered center. All of a sudden homegirls go at jaguar, convertible, jaguar, whatever. I think it's darker than that. I don't think you leave fuck island. You just stay. I think as as the guy is fucking blasting his last dribble inside of you, you feel a cold barrel of a handgun on the back of your head. Jesus. Now this is barry on fuck island. That's it. I guess if there's countries, obviously North Korea, right?

Speaker 4:          02:44:52       That guy's killing people left and right. You can get away with killing people and certain countries like 100 percent, like he killed his half brother. He killed who did kim jong moon. Oh yeah. He hired someone To do that and they apparently they didn't know they were doing it. apparently they were doing a prank. They thought they were doing a prank and he squirted him with something and it turned out to be some neurotoxin. Zapped Him and killed him. But um, he killed some guy who was a general. And then he, because he thought that it was like his uncle that he thought was trying to remember that he killed his kids too because he didn't want his son's taking revenge. So he. Oh, that's hard. So that's going on right now. If that's going on, someone could shoot some crazy corrosion chick on fuck island. oh yeah. So she did a documentary on fuck. Now that's allegedly, by the way, just in case the president is listening. I bet he didn't. He's an outstanding man. How do you think he met her? Perfect grooming. He met her onj date. She swiped right. Is it right? Right or left? Swipe right. He swiped right. Parties. Party. begin. They met up at a starbucks for a coffee date first. Keep it safe. Oh, see, she's upset of the kim jong iun offered no trace of him behind down

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       to his hair according to sources in seoul, South Korea. Whoa. The vice minister of the army was executed with a mortar round for reportedly drinking and carousing during the official mourning period for kim jong il's death. Holy shIt. The vice minister of the army, they shot him with a mortar round. This is a different guy. Holy fuck man. Tracking and carousing during the morning period. Oh my god. They use an anti aircraft gun falling the mortar round method. It seems that kim stepped up his blood lust a bit with his use of an anti aircraft gun antiaircraft guns to annihilate his perceived enemies. He was anti aircraft guns on people. No shit. Yeah.
