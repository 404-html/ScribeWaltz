Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Well, here's the whole thing about the holistic stuff for me and it's sort of the, you know, the wisdom of the Orient and all that kind of bullshit. To me it's like this, if you don't have a real problem, then it'll cure whatever your non real problem is. If your real problem, it's just some sort of fatigue that's based on depression or d or based on something that's going on emotionally in your life. Basically it's living in your head, but you say, oh my joints ache and I have trouble getting out of bed and I give you a magic pill that has a little bit of whisker of the cat and it then that'll work on you. Now if you got a real problem, I do a podcast with a guy named Brian. Brian has a tumor on his brainstem and he's got a real problem that's a different problem and he takes medication that stops the growth of that. If that tumor, it was experimental at the time, but if that tumor grows, then he's dead within six months and he started years old. So when you have a tumor on the base of your spine or the top of your spine and the base, your brain, that's an operable whisker of the cat and the fucking hair, the newt is not going to fucking heel that shit for you

Speaker 2:          01:27          rhino horn for, right, right. No, that doesn't work. If you have a real problem, that's the best combination. Like the best comparison rather is Rhino Horn versus Cialis, right? One of them, you know, only works in your mind and you're like, Whoa, I feel more viral. And the other one gives you a steel rod and your pants for a solid day. Right? You have a choice whether you want to go with Voodoo or that little blue thing.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Well, the Rhino Horn should be a strap on Rhino Horn. You should get the whole horn. Forget about grinding it up into a fucking powder and putting in your teeth. Just give me the whole fucking horn. I'll put, uh, I'll put a, you know, Bob bicycle inner tube around it. Wrapper once around the Pauls and nail over the fucking horn. Could you imagine

Speaker 2:          02:14          how horrible it would be if men had hard ons all the time, like a horn. It wasn't a biological process that you had to like engage in your head. All factors have to be right and anything that's wrong, fear, boner shuts down, drunk debono shuts down. All these things happen. Your bonus shuts down the complex biological process. That is the erection. If we just had a rhino horn and we could just fuck all the time, what a wreck it would be on earth. Everyone would have callous dicks. We'd have like caked calluses all around the outsides of our dicks. Dude. You know all these places instead of Manny petty places, places that would remove the cows is so you could enjoy pleasure with you dick.

Speaker 1:          02:51          And I'm going to step up your apocalyptic boner future nightmare scenario. I'm going to fucking turn one up to 11 then imagine if there were bone poachers. Uh, and they're like, Hey, some guy and uh, Japan wants to make some soup at a Rogan's cock cause he thinks it's going to make his cock harder. Wow. Rogan's a virile guy send to the MMA. So the next thing you know, you've got to look, you're looking over your shoulder because there's some dude and you don't know if he's a game warden or she's on your side or their side, but every time the sun goes down, you've got to worry about the cock poachers. Could you imagine there is no way to grow your duck could like, could you imagine if the only way to grow your Dick would be sucking dicks? You'd have to run around and suck as many dicks as possible to get your dick bigger, but it didn't work.

Speaker 1:          03:42          So girl, when you know you pull your pants up, she'd look at your deck and she would know for a fact, wow, that's a great dick. But this guy most likely sucked a lot of Cox to get that Dick so big. Right. Well then you'd have to explain that that's just a sort of born this way. God's gift. Your Dad and Grandpa have huge Cox. They never suck. Cock. Maybe when you wouldn't want to protest that much, but we'll have to lie about it a little bit. I don't know any builders and steroids. I don't know if the chick would a assume that, but it would be an interesting thing to find out a survey of straight guys, which is if you could grow your cock by sucking cock, would you be in and down for that? It would be like how much does it grow too?

Speaker 1:          04:28          Oh yeah. [inaudible] Holy Shit. There'd be a long negotiation about swallowing, about length, about our we metric or standard. Here we go and millimeters. We going by the inch. How do we do it? I always say this and it was, everyone talks about, you know your Dick, your Dick size. You measure the Dick caddy. Measure that Dick. I say this, it should be standardized. You measure your cock this way. You, you heard it on Joe Rogan's show once and for all. Okay. The official way to do it, use a cloth measuring tape, center of the anus, watts. Hear me out. Center of the anus once around the balls to just pass the tip. Just pass the test. That's the official way I measure my cock and I think it should be a standard that's um, that's very generous of you. That's the way you mess your car. I've heard these supposed to measure from the bottom and I think that's ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Nobody knows [inaudible] don't cheat it back. Go Center once around the balls just passed the tip. Let me ask you another thing, Joe Cocker related. Okay. Tell me down with this. I, I've, I've given this a lot, a lot of thought, a lot more thought and then I'm really comfortable admitting, but I had this idea where we do a water displacement test on every guy over 18 your hard cock into a graduated cylinder filled to the top with water through just a very thin sheet of like stainless steel, lower you down and we literally see how much water's displaced by year. Tumescent cock. Hmm. Okay. Now this factors in girth and length and everything else. This is so water should be a volume thing. This is water displacement. Okay? Once we do that, we do it for every male in America over the age of 18 you then are issued a windbreaker.

Speaker 1:          06:37          That windbreaker has your ranking on it, not how much water you displaced, not how big your cock is. But out of, let's say there's a 100 million males that are over the age of 18 and the United States, what place you come in, number one, that'd be a pretty fucking good windbreaker to have. Yeah. You'd also, anybody was in the top 10 would be making the fucking rounds on the late night shows and each year, you know, there's two, three, 5 million guys turning 18 it all has to be recalibrated every year. I mean, you may see getting bigger if you saw a graph of how big dicks used to be in the 20s and 2000 well, you know, just if, if, if people are getting better, I'm sure. Proportionately we are. So the point is this, you may be number one, but there's always some guy turning 18 I mean there's a thousand guys just turned 18 the time I said that, and they're getting tested and there's a big reveal and for one month everybody's got to wear that windbreaker wherever they are. And you know, look,

Speaker 2:          07:49          we're going to wear that thing for a month. If you're, that's the rule. 2 million, 999 billion. It's starting at 100 million. Yeah. I mean you can be sure somebody is going to be last. Well, there's three, 150 million, 300 million people in the country, so 150 million plus minus wrapped, but then you got to go 18 year old then after that, but let's just call it 100 million people. Okay. And for my money, the number one dude is going to do all the late night shows. And the last dude, he's going to make the rounds to see that one guy that has the biggest cock in the world. Apparently he went to the Tsa, uh, like he was wearing sweatpants and they accused him of trying to smuggle something. The guy's got a giant hog. Yeah. Apparently it was like all over these, uh, news reports and white guy too. Pasty looking white guy.

Speaker 2:          08:37          Yeah. I think his name is Jonah Falcon or something like that. That's, that's what I heard. I think I saw a documentary or something. Do you remember in the porn days, and it's not saying that John Holmes doesn't have a big Dick. He definitely has a big Dick. But remember when we were kids, we'd watch porn. If you saw John Holmes, you'd be like, holy, that's a big Dick. Joanna Falcon. So sad. Frisked by TSA by the way, don't believe it. Ask me who the vice president is. I'm like, ah, ah fuck man. I didn't know it's going to be a history quiz, but big Cox, I'm fucking your man. John Holmes used to have a giant deck right now that's like pretty standard. Like there's a lot of those guys with big giant dicks. Actually the black ones, I don't, well I got a theory about big giant black dicks. Thank God, dovetails nicely into my windbreaker right there. I got a theory about that. Um, and it, and it is the following. First off, how dare you be? Smirch a good name of Johnny Wad home. Cause he did have a big deck. It was very nice. Still Big by today's big Dick Stand and no doubt.

Speaker 1:          09:48          But uh, as far as black guys having big dicks in porn, I think that's a form of porn racism. Hmm. And I'll tell you why. I think if you show up onto a porn set is a black guy with a medium sized cock fair to Midland. You know, you man, I got six and a half inches here. They send you a packet. They're like, we don't need black guys were small cocks willingly black guys with big Cox. We can take a white guy with a medium cock, but we can't take a black guy. Well, why bother getting fucked by a black guy if the guy's got a medium cock? You see what I'm saying? I think they're discriminated against. So I think we think the only huge cock we've seen is in porn. It's on black guys. They won't let average size cocked black men in an I dream of a future where my children can watch pornography and see black guys with medium sized Cox, you know, balls deep in a junky coked up blinds here. Here. Yeah. That's, that's it. That's a future. Yeah. Okay.
