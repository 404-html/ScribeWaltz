Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       we get a bunch of gigs in my house, ladies. Gentlemen. Legion of skanks. Yeah, very excited. All you guys together. This was a good move. Good idea. What's all credit to praise? Praise to big J. fucked it up. You do. But I'm, I'm glad this is a. This is fun. Longtime coming. Fuck yeah. Thanks for having us. My pleasure. My pleasure. I'm very excited to be here. Mr. Rogen Legion to Sancton the house. I'm going to tell you right now what we really mean. This, this has been a very, very long time comment. All of the fans have been, uh, have been kind of looking for this moment. So this is a very, very big deal for me personally. So I want to say thanks for having a song, a sentence away from crying. We're all so big. We probably shouldn't be talking in public. Cheers. Cheers.

Speaker 2:          00:00:53       Gentleman. You wrote that last night. Little Mr. Rogen, how I spent my summer was good and we went to the park and we got to ride all the rides. It's true. What do you want me to say here these days? Yeah. Pretend that it's not a big deal. It's a huge deal. Lewis. Rarely impressed. Very unimpressed guy and he's really impressed today. Yeah. This is a fucking Disneyland for dudes that we're in right now. It we're in an airport hangar and there's just bow and arrows and dead animals and pool tables and a job battlebots the. I feel most men live lives that are very, very suppressed. Sure. Most men, if they were left to their own devices and someone said, yeah, you do whatever you want in the building. Wait a minute. I can just decide what to put in the building, whatever to pull whatever in the building.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       You do the exact same shit for archery. Set up things that I wanted. I wanted to make sure there was room for an indoor range. That was when you went into buying a place. Interesting conversation with a real estate agent. What I need at least 40 yards insurance for that. I said, can I virtual Hunt Dana? Is it requests that virtual hunt game is a very popular game, that techno hunt thing. That thing is. It's so cool. Addictive. Addictive though he can give you bad habits to get a little punchy with your trigger. I do like that they have some of the, uh, animations, not the where the real life things or the deer or the elk. They're looking at you. They really do give you a sad face. Now you do it. Can you do it? Yeah, you can probably get it with other things too, right?

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       Like, couldn't you get it with superheroes? Couldn't you get it like you were that archer dude from the avengers and fucking those monsters are coming after your children because I don't want to do it for me. Can we upload everyone who bullied Lewis in the third grade? Kids. That's the, uh, that's the same kids. That's like when they give the uh, pedophiles like little, like underage fuck dollars to try to keep him from doing it. For Real. She murdered kids with a bow and arrow. She'd never do that. Give it to them. Now they're available in Asia. Some control box. I've heard you can match up up robots and not in this country. I found out. It's a weird moral thing though, right? Like would you or would you rather have them fuck a little robot in their closet somewhere because your first instinct is always like, oh, that's horrible, but then you're like, it's Kinda like giving someone with anger issues a punching bag. Maybe. It's not the worst thing. It's like they've got that thing, whatever it is. Like how do you get it out on that little sweet, sweet, beautiful punching bags.

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       So fucked up feature lists. Robots don't punch back. Do you want to like meet in the middle and you're like, okay, it's legal, but you can't name it. Well, do you think that you could fuck a real doll? I mean you definitely could if you had to, but would that be something you'd be interested in? I think I couldn't stop laughing at how ridiculous this situation rather just jerk off and think about things. I fucked a. We had as a sponsor, a flush left. I've had a flashlight forever. It's very utilitarian. You're not confusing yourself. Nobody's ever said that word before describing she's the girl of my dreams. I've never even used it. I've had it forever. I've never even thought about it. I couldn't guess why I would want to use it. Seems Weird. It's weird. It feels good though. Does it way better than jerking off sculpture whole Dick.

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       Yeah, and you put it in warm water and you get it like to attempt to a body and your life somehow or another. There's like a portal, like this tube is a portal to another woman or another dementia, but all you can get at is her vagina. Just hold it. That's it. Feels real. The name of this dimension is called awesome. Do you jerk off with a fleshlight or do you hold it and fuck it now? He jerked off. Jerked me off with the flashlight. Yeah, but that was for show. That was on camera behind the curt green. This interview. We did this on the podcast. I swear to God. He jerked me off for the producer now. I couldn't get hard. There was a female comic. Whoa. What's that about? Is that a real. That's a real real though. They get pretty good man.

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       They were red head though. It was a documentary on Netflix. About sex robots really have come far because there are people who fall in love with these sex robots and it looks like the fucking taxi driver, Johnny on the spot from total recall. It's like, it's crazy like animatronic chucky cheese, bass player was kind of get to a point where it can totally mimic you and he's going to get to a point where it really is like blade runner, is that what they are now? That's the one I thought about buying a dude one to do Jujitsu with. I was going to order clearly. No. Jake and butthole

Speaker 3:          00:05:59       proportions are perfect because I have a doll. It's Bubba dummy the practice submissions on, but it's super stiff. It's like this, but he beat you. You basically can drill the moves, but it's not the same as drilling and on an anatomically correct body. If you had an AMA anatomically correct body to practice Jujitsu on, you can get some fucking tight moves. Can't wait, can't wait til the day. When you're announcing for robot fights, no, the zero interest. There's nothing at stake. If they live or die, it doesn't matter. The whole thing about fighting is that there's some horrible, gigantic thing at stake. You can fuck one though. Yeah, you can fuck with him. Fight. Would you watch two robots? Fuck. I would. I would if there was like some sort of a program that they were running, I'd want to see like what the program was, how they could do it.

Speaker 3:          00:06:46       Yeah. It wouldn't be a jack material. We completely be fascinated. They would probably talk to each other and numbers and they would both be dudes that would both be. There was one that they just made a fuck dollar. Right. And this, this just happened that there's videos of it. The robot sort of speaking like a weird code to each other. These were like fucking like straight up fuck dolls. Skynet, dude. And they would turn them on and then they sort of speaking and would seem like a code and people were like freaking out about this. Oh I know what you're talking about. Yeah. They had these computers, computer. There were there were linked together and they started communicating to each other in a language that the coders didn't understand and they shut it off. They're like, what? Just simply tell them plugged in, but I heard that my version of it that I just said might be the most spectacular version sounding but might not be accurate and that what do they might've gotten is like they might have got stuck in like a feedback loop and just been making jibberish.

Speaker 3:          00:07:39       Right. I heard that too. So I don't know. No one's confirmed way too fucking stupid to know who's right. Let's just hope it's that second one. The first one I just want sounds like a opening scene in terminator, but at the same terms as the solution being like, don't plug that in. And again man, like what the fuck are we going to do? Like I had a podcast with Sam Harris about it and he is terrified of ai and he's far smarter than me. So whenever I talked to him about shit, I go, oh, okay. And he's terrified. Terrified. That's what freaks me out is when people way smarter than me are terrified about it. Like, uh, what's his name? Eli muskets. Terrified Stephen Hawkins, Stephen. I'm like, no, no, no, no, this is going bad. And then you're like, Shit. Sometimes they're too close to it, you know? I feel like some people also get too bogged down to the details when you live your life very ignorantly, like I do, I have no fear of AI technology guy. So I'll be honest with you. Just self driving tesla already kill somebody or just self driving. Taxi rower. She did something very reckless. She walked right into traffic and she might've been homeless lady. She might've been on drugs. They're not, they're not exactly sure. I don't think the results of the autopsy route yet. But uh, you watched the video, she basically just walks right in

Speaker 4:          00:08:55       front of the car. The car is going down the road. So a person driving wouldn't have made much difference maybe. I don't know, man. It was hard to tell whether or not you'd be able to react. But I guess the technology is, does it have, you know, the technology of stopping quick enough to not hit somebody. They want to make it safer? Right. That's the idea. But I think it is right. I think there's more human error when you're dealing with people drinking, smoking weed, paying attention to their cell phones. I almost would rather just trust, you know, even if there's a few deaths per year, there's way more deaths per year with just laid out the logic for why the robots are going to the lady in black. I trust them. I trust them. Was a black lady. I don't know. It will be fine. There's another video, but just stopping perfectly for a white woman who ran the test needs to reflect on anything dark in the Mediterranean.

Speaker 4:          00:09:47       It just fucking run. The Tesla stops it all of stops it Persian. It turns out just through science it has like the same racism of like the 18 nineties where they're like, we'll give the Italians have passed the rest of you guys. There's two different types of Mexicans is those Oscar de la Hoya Mascot Mexicans. And then there's other Mexicans that look like Indian or the mustache starts on the edge of the lip. Where would it, where would it go with them? You know? You know, that's what the comment. That's what Mexico is essentially, right? It was a combination of the native Americans and Spanish. Yeah. And I think. And then the Spanish ones are like, uh, you know, they're the ones who are like, look down at the locals, but at this point they're all kind of mixed I think. But there's still just a different shape. That's a real Canelo Alvarez.

Speaker 4:          00:10:33       Yeah. Right. Fucking red headed. Very bizarre. Looking at ck is another one. He's already had a Mexican dude. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy. I never even think about that. Louise should have started playing that card a lot harder after the New York. His first, his apology letter should have been like, well, as a Mexican girl Jag, I believe he was born in Mexico. I'm not sure about that though. He was either born in Mexico. He definitely lived in Mexico. Really? I would never have guessed that. Yeah. My family lives in Mexico. They retired to Mexico. My parents did really want to fucking chill out. Jesse the body Ventura talks about Mexico. It's a lot of reverence. Lived there. I've got a buddy of mine who's got a place in Cabo and he loves it. He loves it. It's okay. Cop was a particularly do. She said he, like, I went there to do comedy festival and it's like straight up the worst people from like thinking about the worst, like 40 year old couple from like your hometown, just like fake Tan assholes. Florida city, Florida. But then they all go and meet up in one town. So it's just like thousands of fucking awful people in hot ass. Mexico. Um, I don't get it. I don't get any. I don't understand. If you smoke weed, why you would go to the Caribbean and not just go to Jamaica every single time. Is Jamaica the spot dog dog. He loves it. I love it. Cool.

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       He's pushing it hard on us. Preface with dog. He's being serious. I've never been. Well actually I was, but it was just like a stop on a cruise and I didn't really thought about doing a skanks cruise. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have to actually do that. We do our comedy festival every summer and we thought about doing your weight. It's funny, the festival was influenced by the cruise because we did these cruises and the idea is you can't escape the, you know, the bands can't escape the cruise ship. You're hanging out the whole fucking time. So it's not like you're going to a comedy festivals in 10 different locations. It's, you're going to see a shell. Right. Skank fest is all one location. It's a party, you know, two and a half days nonstop. You're in one location. So everybody's hanging out and drinking. We're doing it this year at a place called Brooklyn bazaar in greenpoint.

Speaker 5:          00:12:38       Brooklyn. It's like a huge. It's an old Polish catering hall. It has like four different rooms. We're gonna have three different stages going on simultaneously. It's really good. And how did red should fear get the publicity scoop? I believe he organized the festival rightly. He's a piece of shit. He got the scoop on. You did that motherfucker now already. I fucking love already to death, but he. How many pills I love already. Death, but however he's a motherfucker crushers podcast, burt's wife hated red May. Still we were talking about before the podcast that all of our friends that got fuck you money already said fuck you. The hardest. Like he does what he wants to do. It's amazing. No, it's fucking beautiful man. Everyday that I'm running around, he's like Asian food at a place somewhere to an escape room in the middle of the day.

Speaker 5:          00:13:36       He's like playful. I think as kids we're all trying to grow up and uh, you know, make money and do what we do. But I think the idea is we're all supposed to be playing this. Why I, you know, I'm joking when I say this, like a do Disneyland, but you come in here and you created an environment to play every day and that's, that's success today, right? Like it to do what you want to do every single day. Play with the toys you want to play with. Hanging out the people you want to play with. And I think everyone thinks like when you don't have money, you think when you get money. Yeah, that's what I'll be like. But then I've watched so many people who do get money and then they're like, yeah, but gotta have retirement money. Got To make sure I have this, got to make sure I do that.

Speaker 5:          00:14:09       You know what I mean? And like artist lives the way you thought you would have before you had it? Yeah. He's not, he's not like flashy either. Like he won't even buy a new car that fuck, he's got a flip phone and he's got like, he's like a minimalist addiction. He's, he's definitely a minimalist for sure. But the flip phones a decision because it was like the fucking he sees he's, he's a very smart guy. He's looking around and all these other people with their cell phones looking at himself and he's like, oh, that thing's just stealing your time and you're addicted to it. You know? Everyone's definitely. I'm definitely addicted to my phone. But the bad thing is that reo just texted me a googleable question.

Speaker 5:          00:14:49       What's the weather in Philly or something? And you're like, alright, this is. He said he mixes it up between his friends. So it doesn't get too annoying to anyone person. Smart. But it was funny as if he has to listen to music, he has to carry around like an extra large ipad to hold his headphones. So that's hilarious. Oh yeah, that's hilarious. Yeah. The ipad in the back of his, in the back of his pants, like a fucking, like a gun. He like inspiring. He's, I would have myself a like at a comedy club of looking at it and are able to literally come and take his hand and put it over the phone and be like, dude, what are you doing? Stop. We hang out, talk to us. And it kind of inspired, made me self conscious around other people doing it. And now every time I see people doing it, I sort of judged them now.

Speaker 5:          00:15:29       And it, it really is true. I mean people live in their cell phone every single day and you lose the connection. People are, it sends a message like, fuck you dude, this person over here is more important than the person that's sitting right in front of me. Well, it's just the phone. This, that light is addictive. It's addictive. Looking at the images, it's like, you know what happens when a little kid sees a TV. You ever see that little kid walks in a room with a TV and commercials going on in the kids like this, just staring at it because it fucks with the way you take in like visual information. There's nothing like that in the wild. There's something like a big screen tv in the wild, right? Like that image of Super Bowl on a big screen, TV and hd and you're like, Holy Shit. You're looking all the green light.

Speaker 5:          00:16:07       All the guys running around smashing into each other. It's intense. You don't get that in a real life thing unless you're about to get eaten. Yeah. We'd like to take that serious, but we've evolved to like see that and treat it like a big cat running at you or something. Right? That's what it is, but it's on your phone and you're watching youtube videos like, look at all that shit. Moving around on my phone. I also like to kill time of a. to where my trick pointed out the other day, if we. If we ever sit down at a restaurant, like don't take food to go and sit down, how quickly I pull out, like we're playing family feud so it's not even just like a pulling back into my phone, but there's still a part of like the let's do something right. Does anybody have a topic?

Speaker 5:          00:16:52       No. Alright, let's talk about. Let's just play family feud. If you give yourself a day in a weird way, you ended up, you make it even worse. And I live in New York, said we all do and like they sort of doing like little signs in the subway that lets you know how long it is before the subway is going to come. And that's pretty. No. Um, when I first moved there in 2001, you would just go. I'm like, dude, I might be here for 30 minutes. I might be here for two minutes. Who knows when the next subway is going to come. But now for subway sign is broken. I can't wait on that platform. I have to got to get up and leave and get a taxi or whatever because I'll lose my mind. Just wondering when that calf is going to come, whereas before you would just chill out and wait because you had to, you didn't have the option to.

Speaker 5:          00:17:28       So now I feel like you have that option to be on your phone at all times, distract yourself, used to take a shit and you know the bathroom reader, it was my favorite thing in the world. It was a little facts like thousands of them in this fat book that you just was covered in. Shit stands ever fucking fuck you out of the bathroom. And it was called uncle John's bathroom reader and it was just basically snapple facts about everything in the world and handling 20th and it was the coolest thing in the world. But now you have your cell phone so you know, I mean it

Speaker 6:          00:17:54       right? But how do you. There's just certain shit. You want to know what's going on in the world. So how do you check in on that? Jesus do it from a computer or like when you want to read the news, like I don't know. How do you get your news?

Speaker 5:          00:18:06       Oh, I, I'm on the laptop on the phone all the time and yeah, and then I just tell these guys what they need to know. Just go get it straight from the trump ban. Yeah. But I'm on the Paul Band. Really come down to taxes. Are you guys, do you know that? Very few legit

Speaker 6:          00:18:27       comics who are as knowledgeable. I mean you guys have Dave's a very valuable resource.

Speaker 5:          00:18:32       Very much so. Really standing. He's brilliant Dave. He's like literally the only person that I know that actually reads the books puts in the time in and it's kind of funny. We say where, where people get their news, they don't really get their news. They read the headline and then they act like they're getting their fucking news. They're not putting in the time that aren't reading the books and actually going and reading a real newspaper reading you, you know, that gentleman pisses what pisses me off about politics. I feel like it's the only thing where like if you don't like. So if you don't, uh, if, if Lewis doesn't watch basketball@allandj.watches every single sixers game, but then there's like a thing coming up where like something about a basketball game, Louis won't just start arguing with you like, Nah, Nah, they need to play this defense. They need to go into a zone because you're like, yeah, I just, I don't really know about that. But for some reason with politics, yeah. No matter how much anybody's not read anything, they don't know anything. They have no problem. Just having a hard core strong opinion like, oh, use. Because I'll see you

Speaker 6:          00:19:24       know about it. Right? So when someone's like super argumentative about it, like, oh, you're not even well informed, which is most of the case with people that are really super aggressive about it.

Speaker 5:          00:19:34       It seems like. I mean, do they have this thing where they were interviewing people at the fucking march for life? I think they called it the gun control march. How feel just now? Well, no, they were like all owners in a bunch of different cities that we saw it, but it happened at a bunch of different cities. I think the big ones were in DC and I think there was one out here like that. There was this guy just interviewing people and he'd go around and ask them if they, uh, if they are for an assault weapons ban and they'd be like, yes, and then he'd go, what's an assault weapon? And it's amazing how many people just didn't know. Now I'm not even. Whatever your take on an assault weapon ban is, it's like, how could you be for banning something that you can't even define as? Just hold on a second.

Speaker 6:          00:20:15       Yeah, exactly. You're like, they know that this is what it does. They, you know, a rifle that shoots people. It's like a semiautomatic. It's on a hunting gun. So rifle is designed to shoot people, like in a military situation, that's what it looks like. So they're raw, they don't know what an ar 15 versus an or whatever versus like what's legal, what's semiautomatic, what's. They'll know all the details, but they do know that these are guns that kill people with.

Speaker 5:          00:20:40       Okay, sure. Fair enough. But I feel like there's like a thing where there'll be like one for a ban on semiautomatic weapons, so you want to ban handguns soon. They're like, no, we want a bad hand guns, but guns are semiautomatic weapons. It's just like if you're gonna protest, read a book on it. It's not just having a passive opinion. You're like out marching to. You know, they want to move the ball down the field though, and the more people that come here, they have kids, literally kids that are in the fifth grade walking out of their classrooms. They don't fucking know what they're talking about or what they're doing. Their task sometimes. There was a girl with armpit hair, you want to fuck me?

Speaker 5:          00:21:15       That's true or dirty Harry. Harry. Every tone mean. But how many of these kids, this is a big one. How many kids are against putting kids on psychotropic drugs, putting kids on unnecessary psychiatric medications. Parents dope their kids up all the time because they don't want to deal with some hyperactive kid. Some kid has got some fucking power, some energy. He said I saw the walls on. I was in. We were embracing the other day right before the show we did. And there was a kid, I mean he must've had autism or or something or some extreme case of it. Uh, but he was like, you know, he was having some sort of violent episode, I'm assuming, but it was just a dad, like calm as day just sitting on a corner with this kid with the kid face down as a kids, like screaming and shaking and kicking his arms and legs.

Speaker 5:          00:22:00       And then I was just holding the kid down and it was so hard to like, I almost wanted to say something like, I didn't know. I know they don't ever really tell you what to do, like, what's going on in that situation. And I kind of watched it for a minute because it looked like he was abusing the kid for a second, but then you kind of realize that like, oh, this kid was gonna like hurt himself or whatever it was. But that's like a, that's like a really, really hard thing. Yeah, I can, I can accept more in the real extreme cases where kids have like severe, severe, severe problems, but it seems like they're just happy to like anyone's like, hyperactive, just this kind of loose thing. So no matter all, it's not a one or a zero. Right. It's like there's, there's varying stages of issues that kids are going to have and some kids are going to need some kind of medication, but they're definitely over prescribing.

Speaker 5:          00:22:43       Definitely. I knew my neighbor had a kid. There was nothing wrong with them. It's just a fucking kid. And they put him on Ritalin or adderall is a drug man. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. That's, it's not. I give it to my five year old. We snorted together. If people don't get enough attention or they don't have an outlet and they don't know what to do with themselves, they get wacky. It doesn't mean you need to give them drugs. Some of these people have legitimate issues and they probably do need medication and some of these people just need to find something that's interesting in life. Yeah. Well I think what you were saying before about like, why don't these kids look into that stuff? I think a lot of times it's just like people want the simple thing and got to actually. This is a really difficult question to get into this stuff. Whereas if you're just like, oh, I'm against guns, that's easy. I think it's the same thing as when people are just offended it. It's like you don't really have to like read a lot. You don't have to know a lot. You just easy to be right and you've got the answer. It's laziness. People can just pick a side very easily and go, cool. Everyone's already defined was on that side, so yeah, I'm on that side. I did my work right,

Speaker 7:          00:23:46       and it's the same being a parent parent. A lot of parents are really lazy and you, you watch it happen when they give their kid an ipad or I, you know, or you know, put them in front of the computer. That whole thing just happened with Elsa Gate, which was, you know, borderline hilarious that parents were getting trolled into their kids watching really fucked up like cartoon.

Speaker 3:          00:24:04       I forgot the name of it. That's the name of it. Yeah. That was crazy. We've talked about that a bunch of times about the babies with the broken bottles over their head up, having the same scene play out. Kids would get drunk whether they were a kid, mice or kill ducks or they would get drunk. A bottle would go flying through the air and hit the baby in the head and blood would be everywhere. It was like a baby's nightmare to. Those videos were so crazy. David Lynch,

Speaker 7:          00:24:31       it was a punishment for shitty parents who weren't watching their kids and what they're putting on their tv because if you were just paying attention for a minute you. I'm saying right it you have to stop paying attention for a couple of hours for a kid to get there, so it was only really shitty parents that we're dealing with that. Is that really true? It's dude. Yeah. There was no way to like land on that just by googling spiderman. That wasn't the first one was coming up. It was. They would. I think there were like paying to get in like a loop of certain videos. Like it was really. I was obsessed with it for like a week and I just couldn't stop going on under that subreddit page and it was freaky dude.

Speaker 3:          00:25:04       They weren't really porn spiderman ones and all these. I think they took some of them down but it's. But then it gets to this place where you're like, okay, are you taking it down because it's targeting children. Are you taking it down because you can't show cartoon babies getting hit in the head with bottles because if that's what you're saying, boy, there's a lot of fucking south parks that you're not gonna be able to show. There's a lot, a lot, a lot of different things. You know, little show. So yeah. Where's the line? Because you think this is creepy and is luring kids in versus the just the act of it was a funny, you know Tim and Eric Sketch. Sure. And a cartoon baby got hit in the head with a bottle. You'd be like, what the fuck? These guys are nuts. That's what you'd say.

Speaker 3:          00:25:48       But you wouldn't be like saying this has got to be removed off of Youtube. Yeah. It's hard to see the intention because you could easily say like, oh well South Park is a cartoon, right? So is that appealing to kids? But I think to Lewis his point that the solution isn't that this shit needs to be banned. The solution is just like let parents know always the solution. Every single time we talk about Louis. What was the other one we watched? Oh father your father with two kids and it's really just creepy issue happen. All right, so this is another one of those like that. The kids are watching that. If you watch it for a second, you're like, this is.

Speaker 7:          00:26:22       I pulled it off. It was a dad and his channel, um, um, I'm sorry, I forget the name of the channel, but he had his two little girls who were probably seven and nine years old and they were doing like, just kind of weird shit dude. They're like eating chocolate bars and it'd be chocolate all over their face and you know, they'd make weird sounds and they'd climb up stairs and they'd show it from like, behind there. But it was very fucking pedophilia cut. Don't even know

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       it was fucked up dude. And this guy is channel got taken down and the guy's like doing interviews, like, Nah, dude, whatever. We also millions of subscribers to the channel making tons of money paying for his house with this channel. Whoa. And they shut the whole channel now. And what did he say when you interviewed them? I don't know, I read some thing when it was just kinda like, yeah, we're trying to get our channel back and you know, he was just like very innocent. There was another thing the same again. So fuck, I'm on my own time.

Speaker 5:          00:27:09       I got to go to Vimeo. Um, but the same when we were talking about this stuff that was mom's, they were regular like mom bloggers. Right? And they bring like their daughter to Kmart. Right? This is the channel, by the way. I'm youtube terminates toy freaks channel amid broader crackdown on disturbing kids content. Okay. It is very, like what Jay said, it's a very David Lynch type vibe. Like you feel like you're in some nightmare world where everyone's just acting not the right human way. That eight point $5 million subscribers, gold plaques that you have amongst her top most 100 most viewed channels on youtube. That's incredible. Either pacifiers in their mouth. It. Dude, it's fucking bizarre. You gotta somehow somehow got to that level before. Can we watch some of this and I can't show it. You can't show it on TV. Can we watch it?

Speaker 5:          00:28:02       Is there a way we can not see it? We're about to get rated. You get what you figured out? Okay. Yeah. Don't know what the problem is. Whenever we put something on youtube that shouldn't be on youtube, we get flagged this. It was like mommy bloggers and they would like have a video of them and their daughter going to the supermarket and it'd be like 500 views. Yeah, don't do it. Jamie. If I was thinking of Youtube flags it so no one else could see it on another website. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. Louis what? Okay. I see. So then they do another, the same mommy blogger would do one called bath time and she's like bathing her five year old and it's not anything more than her like sitting in the bathtub. But those videos were getting millions of views and then the mom would disable the comments and turn off the thumbs up and the thumbs downs.

Speaker 5:          00:28:49       So they were just monetizing pedophiles jerking off to their daughters in a bathtub and it was just like a whole subculture that was happening on youtube that was sort of just. Nobody was really talking about it and they kind of made it go away. It wasn't even a big deal. So this, I'm watching this. It's not disturbing it all. It's just dumb. They just eating weird food and then and getting like whip cream and ice cream and cake and nachos altogether. Well here's what happens. Babies. This is really targeted towards babies. They liked the colors. So what happened? Like they see these flashing crazy colors. Then I'm packaging candy and cake and eating cake and two year olds love this shit. They keep on clicking on it, but pedophiles are also jerking off to these girls putting chocolate bananas in there. So that was sort of the issue.

Speaker 5:          00:29:36       So they got the parents will subscribe to whatever because the kids, they want to put their kid in front of the TV and have the TV babysit them, but it was also another big part of the people who are watching this. You see the comments and sometimes the comments were like encrypted and like in different languages and they were using code words. Are they using that pizza gate yet? It's all connected. It's fucking crazy. If you make a big complaint though about something you have to draw a conclusion to, it really makes it seem like you're the person thinking that you're like, come on. You don't think that's hot. Yeah, exactly. You wouldn't want to jerk off to this. C'Mon. We're all jerking off to this day. Who didn't jerk off to that little early Mitchell that a cheetah with sour cream on it. I'll just go up to anybody and you're just in it for the food.

Speaker 5:          00:30:19       Get these kids out of here family. I didn't notice. You say what can and can't be on TV though or on video or on, you know? When do you say they're going to want this, but I know. Right, but whose day? Right? Because we've all. We've all got this weird thing about free speech because if it wasn't for free speech, we wouldn't be able to do anything, wouldn't be able to do podcasts, wouldn't be able to do comedy, get in trouble for everything. It's very important to be able to express your ideas, but what if those ideas are, you're a. you're a pedophile. Like what if? What about that? Are you allowed to do pedophile anime? Like how it would. Where's the, where's the line and why? Why are we able to draw that line? You know, I draw a Dick Right now when I will drive deck.

Speaker 5:          00:31:02       Here's a deck. Now if I say this is a four year old Dick. Okay, there you go. Well, I'll just say that four year olds got a big Dick. Just got a giant happy man. He put a four year old posts around it too soon. But you read, you raised a really good question. It's like, I think the way it's working now is it's kind of whatever youtube decides or facebook decides because truly we decide, right? Yep. Like they'll have these kind of like vague policy guidelines, but then you'll see some people violate it and it's not a problem, but if it's a message that they don't like, then that seems to be the one that gets taken off. I just, I don't know, man. It's hard. I, I honestly, I'm, I would defend free speech toward anything. Like, I don't care what you're saying, unless you're inciting violence, just legally speaking, a defendant like you got to be allowed to say anything.

Speaker 5:          00:31:51       Even if it's like I wanna fuck kids or something that's really disgusting like that. As long as you're not actually fucking kids, you're not doing anything. When I, you gotTa have fuel, do you think you should always employee you're free ability for free speech though? Like sometimes just don't know. Of course there's lots of things you shouldn't say that place is different. That's not like a park. You see? Here's the thing. I think in our lifetime there's going to be words that are bad that you're not gonna be able to say in public spaces like parks and shit like that. I can say parks. Rosa parks. Yes. It could be. That's one of the ones that ask Jamie Google something. What was that? Um, the store recently where they were talking about child brides somewhere in some country where they were trying to allow people to be married as young as 11 and that up until recently they could do that. They could be married as young as 11 pounds. It's A. Yeah, it's a state. Where's that just? Is it.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       Is it a state? No. Sierra Leone. Is that what it is? The article I just came up from yesterday? Yes, that's it. What age is it? Didn't pop up. I'm trying to see. What I'm trying to say is like, this is obviously just ask. Sorry. There's actually another one for Missouri. What's two hours ago? I built to restrict child marriage and Missouri moves forward. It says, oh, I didn't see that one child marriage in Missouri because people are fighting for it. That like, yeah, my baby should be able to get married at 12 years old. Yeah. Yeah. Once you get married and he's not having sex anymore, so it's all day fucking parents idea. It's not little kids clamoring to get married. Bill to restrict child marriage. Missouri moves forward. Whoa. Hold the 15 year old. Wow. The only state that requires only of one parent for 15 year old to marry has made the state a popular destination for child bride.

Speaker 3:          00:33:37       That is so good job to the best child. Broad Getaway, Missouri in Missouri is defense. That's the only time they've ever been referred to as a popular destination. So they're. They're doing what they can to attract tourists. Yeah, that's dark. That's dark because those places where like, you know, professions are like moss gathering and making some sort of sap juice. You don't. I'm like, you can't marry a 15 year old though. They can marry each other. I'd imagine it's statutory rape is that, you know, there was a state where male to female, the girl had to be 18, but male to male, the boiling had to be 13. Well, that's a little bit of a gap. It was one of the states where they were pedophiles. The Catholic Church was sending pedophiles kind of want to say it's New Mexico. New Mexico had some super fucking squirrely laws. Hundreds of childhood brides in Arizona.

Speaker 3:          00:34:37       Wow. Arizona as child brides. There's a bum fuck of every state. I don't know how to Google this because I think that is one of those states want to say it's New Mexico, but it might not have been where you. The mail could be 18 or the male. Could be a 13 man. Jamie's computers just going to have the most fucked up search history on the computer. Where can I find a 13 year old boy to Mary. How about, what about male to female? Shouldn't that be different? I kind of like boy to girl, meaning like woman to to 14 year old kid. I do. I think that's kind of different like the dogma of like there's no difference between the sexes or shit like that. It's ridiculous. And then like I don't, I definitely don't think. I'm not saying it's cool, but when you hear about some hot chick teacher who was fucking her teenage students, I definitely don't look at that the same way that I look at some dude who's fucking teenage.

Speaker 3:          00:35:32       Like that's just a more fucked up. I look at it as like she's a little bit more fucked up because I don't ever talk to women that are like, oh young dude, that's what I'm into. And you are you talking to every dude behind the scenes? Like, Oh yeah, 19 year old tractor, that'll be hot. You know, she's definitely fucked up, but those women play very important roles in, in taking a young man's hand reading of sexuality. It's not like I got molested by a 21 year old when I was 13. She was hot and it was great. Period.

Speaker 3:          00:36:03       Dick. She made out with me like the whole deal. I, I didn't, I couldn't get a hard on. I was a full panic. I couldn't lose. I was making out with this lady. What was she babysitting? You know, she lived down the street. Nice, nice person. She played softball with us and was fucked a bunch of us when she was 21 and the thing is, man, she was pretty. It was weird. She was fucked when she was a kid I think could be anything. It's always passed down from a another generation. No, you're probably right. You know, whatever. She was very nice. She was very.

Speaker 3:          00:36:36       She was a fun person. She was fun to be around. We all, we all liked her, but she fucked everybody. Yeah. So I just adore now. I didn't, I didn't know. She just grabbed my dick. Like I said, I couldn't even get it up. I panicked, but I didn't. I mean they didn't even know what getting it up was like. I think she was the first person ever kissed. You didn't come back around to her though later to see where you stepped up and moved. We moved, we wound up moving into the next year and I went to high school in a different part of town. I was already jerking off for years at that point it's giving it up. Literally jerking off from where I was, like nine or eight. He started jerking off at night. Hey, I about my teddy bears and my pillows. Is that the same as jerking off to it?

Speaker 3:          00:37:18       Because then I would use my hand. I was like 10 and I remember I remember the transition of not coming anything to when I actually shot a liquid and it was like I graduated in masturbation because I'd watched porn at that point, but it's like an eighth grade graduation. It's not the real graduated, just kinda like, you know, we're trying to make them feel good about himself. So I just jerk off until after I'd had sex. No, really? I didn't start jerking off until after I had sex. I have no idea why either. Somewhere between 15 and 16. It might've been 16. It might've been 15. I'm not sure. Then you were like, I want to feel this again. I don't have time to find a chicken. Everything is like I. When I started jerking off I went, oh this is what's going on. Like I'm a junkie. Like my body is like, like completely addicted to the idea of girls. Right? You're 17 years old or whatever the fuck I was 15 years old. Your body's just like girls, girls. But if you jerk off it's like Oh, they're just just people without the need for coming. Like then you'd like them based on their merits, their job. But if you just. Joe, I realized that literally

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       when I was 16 years old, if I just jerked off like what I was willing to tolerate with so much less we will do. When you go. We talking about the sexual robots before and if, if we kind of got off on a. If pedophiles should be able to fuck, I mean, you kind of think about that. Do they have that built up pedophile, full balls, walking around just seeing kids just given up on them. There's no way to fix that. I think their disease, I think there's like a sickness. I don't know if you could like, I don't know if be able to fix them. I think when you even chemical castration show like that. That's crazy. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, uh, I don't, I don't know what the. Like there are people that have this inclination that would never act on it and an ethics and morals they want to fuck anybody up, which is also crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:39:17       It's like, wow. Okay. So it's like a nuclear suitcase. He just walking around neighborhoods just ready to detonate buildings and we just trust that he's never going to use it. Right. It's a weird thing to want. Or if you can get like a weird video game, like you're hunting video game and he just swallow up a building with a suitcase once in a while. But here's the thing, like if he doesn't do anything, he's not a criminal, like if he has this thing and he fights this demon every day and he successfully slays at every day, who are we to come in and say, you shouldn't have these thoughts. No. If anything I look at that is probably. It's somebody who was abused as a child, is had a horrible life and isn't harming anybody else. You almost kind of are like, honestly, it's chemical castration, two wolves. We've got to find the dexter of terrorists terror, a terrorist who only terrorizes terrorists.

Speaker 5:          00:40:09       Pedophiles who only goes after, like located deserve to be a quantum leap to another city. Like quantum leap. What a crazy sickness that you can implant in someone's mind that if you can molest them, they will want to molest others. Vampires. Yeah. Yeah. I mean really is. It really is like a vampire thing. Do not invite a pedophile into your home to probably is where it comes from. Right? Like stealing your joy, sucking the life out of your family less than your kid and just being violent in general. I think it's like that. I think most people who are like, like a not violent and like the criminal sentence, not in like, you know, being like in martial arts or something like that, but like people who like, you know, assault and Kale and shit like that. It's like I think 99 percent of the time they were fucking beaten as a child.

Speaker 5:          00:40:57       They always kicks his ass, but those guys can go play a video game where they shoot people in the fucking head and they get off on that and pedophiles don't have that same type of outlet that those guys have. Yeah, that's interesting, isn't it? So isn't. It's we look at pedophiles is almost being worse than murder, right? Like somebody wants to commit murder. We understand it kind of is worse than murder and we're like, I had a five year old. I'm telling you right now, like is it worse than somebody killing him? It's, it's no, not making him crazy. Like if someone just killed, like if someone has a distressing, so sexy

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       you blue hair, it was like who is making the sexy clothes

Speaker 6:          00:41:45       into one of those beauty pageants? Never been to a little, little tiny kids. What Diaz and Duncan were in Dallas wants and we're going. We were working at the Addison Improv and while we're in Dallas, in our hotel, they had this childhood beauty pageant. It was the craziest shit you've ever seen in your life. I'm talking about like five year olds with full makeup and like dresses, but they're dressed like a woman with high heels. They're walking around in high heels. He's little tiny kids. I mean high heels come fuck me. Pumps like it's crazy looking at them and you're, you're looking at these like super dolled up and that's essentially the Jonbenet Ramsey story. Right? You know when, when Jonbenet Ramsey where they did an autopsy on her, they found out that she had been sexually active. Yes. And she was, what, seven or something like on killed her. It was something like seven killed her. Some say it was the dad. Some say it was someone out brother, the brother. He said that stories horseshit. He's like, you guys are monsters. My sister was fucking killed and you're, you're blaming me and I didn't do a goddamn thing. Well, he should really be upset at God because it doesn't look like a guy who fucked and killed his sister.

Speaker 6:          00:43:02       For sure. Poor bastard. Magic grown up your whole life knowing that someone fucked and killed your sister. Yeah, he's got a crazy big uh, yeah. No, it be jealous too because they give her more attention the whole time. It's like Marcia, Marcia, Marcia, the end, my favorite. My favorite theory is the brother did it by accident and the parents try to cover it up, but that's just my favorite documentary answer. They connected the handwriting. They were trying to connect the handwriting of the ransom note or whatever the fuck it was. The one whatever note was left behind. There was a note left behind and they said it was really similar to the mother's handwriting. They cuddled ticket. They made a conclusive decision about that, but that's like what if you have normal hand writing somebody else's normal handwriting and they kill your kid and now people think you killed your kid because you're right. Normal. You know what I mean? How, like you got to defend the fact that you like put a little curve on the younger your is handwriting Shit. I mean does it. That is it that good?

Speaker 4:          00:43:59       I didn't find a handwriting expert that if you pay them enough they'll say that it's not sure, but that's all bullshit guys and whoever you get. But there's gotta be some science behind it. There must be looped if you ever like seen them analyze. It's I've seen like undocumented is and how they analyze it, it's like they loop it that way the same way. It's all at the same angles, but they will, they will use that in courts. Right. But I don't think it's substantial evidence. Polygraphs, like there's some science to it, but it's not like you can't get convicted off that. I couldn't believe anybody that passed a polygraph test.

Speaker 6:          00:44:29       You'd see it up on the screen up. There's

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       a Jonbenet Ramsey, John Ramsey's ransom note and patty Ramsey and you watch how she writes and you watch how rent Patty Patsy, Patsy Ramsey writes and you're like, oh yeah, of this. She didn't even try to hide it. Well, I mean she writes the same way, the ages of the same. If you look at the end of the age yet, we'll look at the size of the a's and the seas. They're very, very uniform in size from hers to the ransom note, but very different than John's

Speaker 3:          00:45:03       like it's a, it's a like, it's her handwriting. Like now I see it. She killed us. Have those words and it looks. I mean it really, really looks like she wrote that note. So the one, the patsy Ramsey at ransom note in the middle is the one where she said, look, it's not my handwriting. Right? Is that what you're saying? Yes. They made her write. The brands like that started talking about it. The sheet of paper. Yeah. They said here's some words we'd like you to write them out. And she wrote them out pretty much exactly the same way. I mean she didn't even try to hide it.

Speaker 3:          00:45:40       That's crazy. Now I get it. Okay. So then, I mean I'm sure if we had an expert in here that he explained that there's some sort of science behind it. Yeah. That house, I lived in boulder nine fucking years ago and that house is still for sale. Oh, you can't sell it. It's a nice house. They can't sell that house. He changed the name of the street like Trent Reznor. Marilyn Manson donor doesn't want to buy you. Like rockstars are like really weird, like eccentric people that want to like have something like that. No, nobody wants to buy a house where a kid was killed. Good enough deal. How expensive is it? It's a good deal. Not a great deal. A great deal, but you might be able to negotiate the deal. Mike. Dude, I know you mentioned a crazy fucking like you're on stage in the middle of the show and you see like things behind you.

Speaker 3:          00:46:32       Ghosts. You know, that's the thing about the comedy store podcasts down that basement, like debate that paid millions of people been killed in that piece of it. That was like Bugsy Siegel's place, those Ciro's nightclub. So like for sure if you're going to kill somebody, you kill him in the basement. Right? How many guys do you think they killed in that basement? Bugsy Siegel with a nightclub on sunset for sure. A gang of people. There's probably a bunch of people killed as it since it's been the comedy store. Well, there's probably been. Well, we know there's one that took place in the base patio or the front pad. Yeah. Yeah. That was. I was on my way there that night. That was crazy. Yeah. Great Alibi, Jay. I was on my way. I was on my way. Me and Louis go holding a newspaper and a car near the streets are many miles away. Louis j Gomez get

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       it right for the press release and right. Yeah. I, I, whenever some reason their documentary comes out about an old thing that I've heard a thousand things about. I'll still watch them again. I've got way deep into Charles Manson again because I was going to say Charles Manson was. People have bought those houses for sure. Houses sold over and over again. I'm telling you right now. Yeah, that's true. They haven't marketed that fucking house the right way because they could get some Weirdo to buy it in Amityville horror house. Those bullshit, like nothing ever really happened there, right? It depends on what document are you. I mean, some people are like, the whole thing is fake. It's all fake. I think it's kind of bullshit. I think they just sort of concocted it for that movie. I went to see that movie. I was scared out of my fucking mind. I was thinking, oh my God, these people, they bought this house and it's haunted. Fuck man. That sucks. What if that was us? If you're a little kid and then you found it. What based on true events means, like I heard a weird creek in the middle of the night, like bees came out of your toilet.

Speaker 2:          00:48:32       I'm gonna. Go ahead and change them. But then at a bees came out of the wall, started bleeding. I grew up so poor that like just the idea of buying a house. I was watching those movies. I was like, I don't know. What do you want me to say guys? I'm renting. We're on section eight. I would fucking deal with the ghosts telling them something. Yeah, I know right where you scared a few ghosts would have ever done and never killed anybody. A little bit of a fucking ghost killed them. No one's ever died from a ghost. Yeah. It's always like they moved the toy car like across a table or something like that. How you get past that shit. People. I had my mom, my roommate back when I was 21, my buddy Jimmy detail you, me and him got a [inaudible] board once. We said, all right, we're going to find out this bullshit, and he's like, you're not going to move it right.

Speaker 2:          00:49:13       And I go, I'm not going to move it. I go, you're not going to move it as I'm not gonna move that fucking thing. It was where to find out this is bullshit. And we sat around for like an hour and 45 minutes of this fucking stupid weegee board ask any questions. Sitting there looking at me and he wasn't even. He wasn't even budget at the end of it. My friend Jimmy, he folds everything off, stuffs it in a garbage bag. He goes, I'm taking this piece of shit out to the trash right now. I mean, people convince themselves of everything. You know, the start moving that thing like, oh my God, it's going to the a I can't believe. And the end and the d is telling us something, Andy from beyond the grave. It's like fake martial arts where they're using fucking knock you down and they all just fits it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:59       It's the same people that, uh, that prey on them are predators. Do you think like, the people who go, I'm talking to you. It's too, that's the problem. They actually pieces of shit. They're both, there's pieces of shit that, some of them are just con artists. Some of them are idiots who are fooled by it as what they're teaching. I mean, that's Sylvia Brown, wasn't she the one that told the girls they found in Cleveland, like told one of her parents. She's moved on to a better place now and right? Yeah. Did they have stop looking for your daughter was dead and she was at a fucking. That's crazy. She made them stop looking for different. Is that than religion though? So I, you know, I can sit there and the person that's doing that on a dumb fucking stage more personal. Yeah, no religion. You are basically, you're, you're projecting these ancient stories, right?

Speaker 2:          00:50:47       That's what you're doing. You're, you're giving lessons in these ancient stories, but when you're actually doing it to a single person that seems way worse. Right? It's very focused and also religion people get, there are good intentions. Sometimes the people doing it. That's tradition and stuff where you grow up that way and you just kind of like. But I know that's like, that's, that's predatory. They're looking for someone to make money by exploring like the worst possible thing about their life in terms of is it truth? They're both equally probably, you know, like bullshit, but one is directly targeting and fucking with somebody also probably killed millions and millions and millions of people and these people are just fucking stupid. A few idiots out of there. But those idiots deserve to be duped. I mean, look, wounded antelopes should not go to the waterhole. That's just how it goes. You get jack everything isn't antelope analogy.

Speaker 2:          00:51:36       You Gel well. This is dumb as they're supposed to get taken out. Did you, uh, did you watch the documentary and honest liar about the amazing. Randy would go pick apart those televangelists and like interrupt their frequency and expose their tricks. Well, he's one of those to a Uri Geller. He just tried to end him. Peter, Steve Martin. That's the entire. No, no, it's all based off of it. So they try to intercept that signal, but he did it with a lot of things. Uri Geller, the bending spoons guy made him go away for about 20 years. Well, he's got this a million dollar challenge and I believe Said, look up the randy challenge. It's to show him any evidence of any sort of telekinetic powers or psychic abilities, any measurable psychic abilities and you can win a million bucks because nobody can show shit. Well, he did. He did. He did a study, I believe at Princeton University that gave him all this money to have these guys come.

Speaker 2:          00:52:37       Anyhow, he just, he hired three other magicians and it was to have them come sit there for days and try to figure out how to do this crazy telekinetic thing and then they ended up doing it and there was a big press conference and he was like, they're all magicians. There's no telekinesis goes, hey, just show that it was a trick. They all did and they got like 10 guys. Some of those guys are fucking incredible. Well, I did that show Joe Rogan questions, everything. We did an episode on psychics and we got this guy named bandit check and he's a vegas magician. He's a wizard dude. He does all the spoon bending shit in front of you and you know what it is, man. I mean, he didn't explain it to me. I had to go and Google it. It's not really the same metal. It's some metal that if you just heat it up by moving your hands back and forth, it just bends. I used to want to be a magician as a kid. I really did. And there's, if you take it like a cheap enough spoon and you literally just a, you could bend

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       it like a few times and it'll just look straight. That's one of the trucks. We'll just use your finger and you make it melt away. But this is a very specific kind of metal. They do this too. It's like, you know. But aluminum is like super weak in some. Some forms, not like car frame forms, but in some forms of not alloys. Aluminum is it scratches easier. It's like there's metals that are like our lead. I was thinking of lead scratches easier. It's like a, it's kind of metal that's pliable. You can bite into a gold coin, right? You can actually see teeth marks. That's all people knew. The goal was real. This shit. He just rubbed your fingers and it just droops. It just gives in. I spent. But no, you guys made this remarkably well for four microphones, podcast. That would've never happened in a million years.

Speaker 3:          00:54:14       It was just screaming at each other. Faggot for them. We're on our best behavior right now to this is church Sunday for us. After you faggots first. No, I'm just saying, can you imagine like precise science, how much people got freaked out by people who like new magic or new, some type of slight of hand like that. When you can look at Google, you can google that. Oh, there's a different type of metal that you can burn them and just like he is communicating with those people didn't know how to ask you questions that are leading you into telling them the answers. Right? Those techniques to that. You know, I talked to Penn Jillette about that once and he was explaining to me how when someone talks to you, they get you to give them the answer and then they say the answer and it makes them look like a wizard, but they're just, they've gone through these patterns so many times. I mean, how many people have problems with their dad? How many people have a brother that died? How many people you know, they like, there's someone missing. Who is my brother? Yes, I see. I see. And this is not a good thing. Oh yes, I see. Yeah, I see that he loves you. And he misses you and he's very sad that he didn't get to say goodbye.

Speaker 3:          00:55:28       He doesn't. And then he comes home. He goes, dude, she knew about my brother getting out fucking dummy. You knew about your brother. She was. She'd tell you about some shit that hasn't happened yet. She's telling you about some shit you already know because you're a dumb ass and you're playing checkers with the ladies playing chess on you.

Speaker 2:          00:55:46       My friend who I stayed with when I'm out here has a very good friend who's a psychic medium. He's a very nice guy, but she, she really wants to believe in him so much and I'm farm the way he does is an entertaining thing. And she's like, you don't believe it at all. I go, here's why I don't believe it. If you have fucking powers. And then also like, you know, you go to target because you need shampoo. I don't know. It seems like it would be a burden to live with the gift of magic powers. And then you're just like, oh yeah, I'll swing by Mcdonald's. I'm a little hungry for a snack. It all stems from US walking around, wouldn't

Speaker 3:          00:56:22       it be much if I knew exactly

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       what was going to happen, knew who these people who's good and who's bad when that'd be better than everybody has that feeling, but nobody has those abilities. So you go on knowledge and instincts and life experience and you compile it altogether and some people are really good at it and some people suck at it and the people that suck at it, they'd go to someone else for advice and one of the ways they go to advice that lady with the neon sign, Psychic, oh look at the palm. She must be a magician. I go in there and this is you. I see it in New York City. You'll walk down the street, there's a psychic, has a window of storefront palm glowing in the and you're like, well, I don't have them. How are you affording the fucking rent here? They get a bunch of suckers and the one thing about is is if they're good, if you have a good connection with that sucker, that soccer wants to come back next week.

Speaker 7:          00:57:10       Soccer wants to keep coming to you like you. We have to discuss this. Can you be here Thursday also part of the job. No problem. And then this fucking Dork, he's all excited about Thursday on Thursday, the Magnum is going to take my company and this fucking Dude Shit have gotten taken out by a Hyena high initiative, clipped his ankles, dragged him, and they all would have jumped out of nowhere and mall this fucking asshole because he didn't listen to anybody, but no, we survive in this world. Yes. Nature had an answer for this guy. But then the one smart guy who was supposed to survive invented some shit and then told everyone else about it. And now these guys have that invention. It you wrote like an old bit of yours where you touched on this. I really fucking love that joke where you're like, uh, uh, when you realize there's no such thing as adults like everyone else.

Speaker 7:          00:57:56       That was a real moment with me because people. But that's what it is. That none of us really know what the fuck's going on. We all like to to comfort ourselves by thinking we know what's going on, and then if someone else can convince you, they kind of know what's going on. It's like we look for that. Like were like, oh, thank God I found someone now. Now I know what's going on, but we're all full of shit. People are followers. That's what it is. We should look at these psychics like we look at coyotes, they take out the dummies. They just take. They get into the system. They find cracks. They expose weakness and dummies hanging out with dummies. Right? So it's like the referral business and world. Everything dude. Oh, and everybody wants to think that they have the person. Oh my God, she is amazing.

Speaker 7:          00:58:39       She knows so much about me. First of all, when I knew her, when I walked in the room, she touched both my shoulders and I knew her for my whole life. Incredible. She's an incredible and they all want to convince themselves that this fucking crazy bitch that they keep paying money to isn't just lying to them. That's right. Because it's not just that you're being conned. It's like you're the accomplice in the con you want because you're causing yourself with just those kung fu videos. Those guys want to be conned by this touch and the guy goes flying across the room. They want. They want to be for you to have. You're working with this master. No problem, Dave. I always make the sidekick to automate brown and I just pretend my ex wife is dead and I want to make. What's that one where you remember about ghosts to automate? Brown pretended to be a patrick swayze and they made out with Demi Moore will be a boy, but they wouldn't show. We'll be making out with leaning in and then it turned into Patrick swayze,

Speaker 2:          00:59:38       which was weak shit. Realistically, Whoopi Goldberg was fucking French and heart that's making that movie today. I want to go about. That will be Goldberg now I'm too heavy. It would just be all checks that Xyz is a check tail. That's the reboot Ronda Rousey. Ronda Rousey is. Yeah. They could remake that movie. It probably. Well one day. They definitely could. They can make anything so doing some shitty ones coming up soon. I'm trying to remember what they are, but there's some real like, it's too soon. Why would you farmers from my liking? Like a few more of those please.

Speaker 7:          01:00:19       Yeah, they really thought that was going to. It was so cool. The first one, when they made that truck turn into that fucking robot, it was the coolest thing. Guys are making some money. They're making some money

Speaker 2:          01:00:28       in a fucking shit ton of money. It's like when the fast and furious 89 came out, you know, you're like, what? How many have they have?

Speaker 7:          01:00:37       They sound like I've never watched more than 14 minutes of one of these lobbyists. I have no idea.

Speaker 2:          01:00:41       Did you ever hear Vin diesel talk about, uh, the movies? Like the reference where he's like, we made a multicultural movie that showed races working together too long. Dudes of just about like Bikini. It's Maxim magazine, man. It's fast cars. A Bikini to one point. One six, $3,000,000,000. Just the last one. Oh my God. And the budget was $250. Million Dollars. Wow. So they made three quarters a male solid

Speaker 7:          01:01:12       budget on. It's not even fucking crazy. It's cars driving fast. You got ludicrous.

Speaker 2:          01:01:19       He must have a lot of special effects. Budget. That's shit's expensive. You want to launch cars through the air. The stuff that they do is fucking insane. I mean, I don't know how much of it's CGI and how much of it they're really dealing with cars, but as a person who loves muscle cars, it hurts my heart. Watching those cars get fucking launched through the air. Much more so many of these. They only made so many 1969 chargers, right? He feels that they're destroying them. I like the Dukes of hazard. How many fucking chargers did they wreck for the Dukes of Hazzard? Launching them across a bridge landing. I'm nose down. You see the car bend drive away like nothing's happening. How Louis Myeloma noticed and they kill like 15 years.

Speaker 7:          01:02:00       It's so funny. That movie. You remember the movie my own Otis? Yes. Pug nose pop, little orange cat. Fucking grateful that I got to be honest with you. I don't think it holds up the amount of pugs and kittens that died during the making of this film. You have to watch it because otherwise otherwise they died in vain. They took the, like it was

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       another movie that was made in like Japan or China or somewhere in Asia. Uh, and they didn't give a fuck. There was no walls. I'm like, how you treat a cats and dogs in that country. They don't care how you treat humans back there. So there's a scene where the dog is fighting off a bear and this bear, I mean they must have just went through 30 pugs with this bear scene alone, but there's no confirm numbers of deaths. But there was like a bunch of other. When you watched the movie, you're like, you're like, oh man, how did they get that dog to fight with that bear? And it's like, well, we lost like $300. That's how we did a Jesus Christ. Really a bunch of. There's a scene where he's in the water swimming, maybe eight of them right there. How many dogs tied? We looked it up one time. I forget a lot. I know Dudley Moore narrated at the eight in that scene.

Speaker 5:          01:03:09       Jesus Christ. That is so crazy. Holy Fuck, I'm looking at the elks head behind you. Damage more value that elc has done a puppy. Why don't we put so much more value when a puppy's life versus that elk slide. Cute, cute, cute privilege. But like you'll swap out mosquito. Yeah. I only care about human swat mosquitoes. Yeah, that's a good point. I know. Kill plants which are living right and that's. I only care about humans and dogs. Love peanut butter off your dead cats too. I do enjoy cats. I never liked cats, but then my girlfriend brought her mom's cat to live with us for a little bit and I got attached to that fucking cat fiance kind of animals. I love them in the wild. I love them and I just love them in their environment. I think it's. Look, it is a weird thing that we've gotten totally accustomed to that you could just get out of this studio right now.

Speaker 5:          01:04:03       You could drive 15, 20 minutes over to Pang cane. Get out of your car, walk 300 yards into the woods and you're just living with animals, eating animals. You are basically in another dimension. There's eagles when there's not too many eagles, but a lot of hawks that fly around, they're just constantly looking for some shit to Jack and if either there at the right time you could see it happen. You can see a coyote snatch a rabbit or you know, different animals just constantly looking for something else to eat. It's right there. Yeah. We're so removed from it. Like if you, if you want to be like, well you put yourself out there and that's a big difference between New York and La. Like la is the city where there's beautiful nature within it. New York's like just the city and then you've got to leave to go to any beautiful.

Speaker 5:          01:04:46       Right. So it's almost like you can be, but I mean just the fact that we just go, you go to a grocery store and my relationship with animals is like, there's a steak. Let me pick it up and buy it. And it's not. None of them like, oh, this came from fucking killing a cow in someone. Do you ever go to Malibu once? There's places in Malibu that it, like ranches, like they're really long. I think it's something like 30 something miles of coast and along the way, like up in the hill, there's like Alpaca farms and shit like that and that shit. You could just get in your car and then boom, you're in La and

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       then get in your car and boom, you're in the Alpaca farm. That nature you're describing those scares the shit out of the hamster ball. No, they're going to show the dog tell that none of this is the movie. This is from the movie, but this is actually having that bear killed that dog. Yeah. That is so crazy. And the movie, the bear dog fights off the bear. I know, but that's so crazy that they allowed this crazy. I don't know. Like you're just like, oh man, they must have had the best animal trainers. Like, nope. They just. We threw a dog versus a bad God. That's so crazy. Imagine what the fucking pugs looked like to after bears just ripping apart. Like twitching. My Buddy John. John Dudley saw a bear. He saw a grizzly bear, killed a moose with one swat. He said he had never seen anything like it that it was.

Speaker 6:          01:06:11       He was looking through his by nose and he saw this bear swat, this moose in the back and it just broke. It's back and the Moose just goes down. A Moose. Moose are so big. Huge. There are so big. Matt said this Grizzly just fucking swatted it and they saw it happen and that they're so powerful that swatting it in the back broke it's back and the thing went down and then he's just ripping it apart. One of my favorite pranks on my friends is I send them a video and I say, Watch A. Watch this.

Speaker 6:          01:06:45       He's got a moose by the neck. Just dragging it through the woods. Those fucking animals. Do you want. Everyone's looking for monsters. There's a God damn monster. That thing just killed a moose talking about Bj dragged into the woods. Hey, bear [inaudible]. My favorite pranks planned paypal is I send them an email and say, check out this video of this deer, a beating up this bear, and then it's. There's a famous video of a bear just killing a deer in the backyard, like in the deer is making them as awful, horrible sound you'll ever hear her entire life and Louis goes, the deere makes a come back, wait for it, wait for it, and just gets people to watch the video, watch the deer being mauled alive with the most horrible sound and then let it go. That's the old frank. I was hoping there was like a dude's dick somewhere in the help too.

Speaker 6:          01:07:32       To be fair, most of has pranks. Do have a dude's Dick and it somewhere, but this one is just barren, dear. Yeah. That's how it goes. Bears are different than other animals in that they eat a lot of shit. They eat a lot of berries, a lot of plants, and they also eat animals. Whatever they get ahold of so they don't kill the animal first. There are also real sturdy. They're. They're not like a cat, like cats are really powerful, but cats are more flexible and pliable. A bears more of a just a fucking machine or bears more of like a like cats are like hoists. Gracie, a bear's, Dan Henderson. He's just coming in there throwing overhand rights. Maybe even taking people on the back. Melvin manhoef. Just a powerhouse. Dave Henderson, a hairy gay guy. No, that's not the different kind

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       of bare pro. Oh, nature bears. You guys say nature. Me Don't try to get me in trouble with Dan Henderson. I'm actually more like brock because I've learned with Frank Mir describe rockland. Top of him. He was like, it was like a car that was slowly onto him and he couldn't push it off. Like, you know, imagine a bears on you. You're just like sitting there like, dude, it's got my shoulder blade and it's just knowing that my shoulder blade and I'm. I know I'm going to die. Nothing you can do. Holy Fuck. Do you think you went, you're the adrenaline will kick in where you wouldn't feel the pain or do you think it would be the most horrible fucking. He definitely wouldn't feel it. You'd feel it. It would hurt, but you would be so terrified of death and you'd be so overwhelmed with all these fucking neurochemicals to be flying through your synapses. You'd be out of your mind.

Speaker 4:          01:08:58       You'd feel like the pressure of that. It's happening.

Speaker 3:          01:09:05       You would. You'd. There'd be so much adrenaline. You'd be in another dimension before you knew it. That's probably a trigger that seems like the worst way to die. Just a guy who got bit real bad and came back and had a video. He did a selfie and talked about what happened. He was just walking, hiking down a trail, scouting, and he came upon A. I'm a female grizzly and her cubs, which is the worst scenario. A male grizzly doesn't really, unless he's really old and it's really late in the season. Usually they'll just get the fuck away from you, but the females will fuck you up and this female fucked him up and tore his scalp right off of his skull and he had it like packed down with a baseball hat, like try to try to hold it in place and his arm snapped and he had big bite marks in his arm, but this guy was like a Montana dude like in the Montana. Tough. So he's like, well, vitals are intact.

Speaker 4:          01:10:00       Might be broken. I don't know what's going on up there. Holy Shit. Fucking yoga teacher in La. Safe space. There he is. Oh my God. Down his head. The grizzly with two cubs you can barely see, but the right side of his ear, his head is basically ripped apart. I'll save my watch though. He put the hat on to make himself like, you know my fucking kidding. I never got my daddy's wash. He drove himself to the hospital after walking three miles to his car. That's a fucking man. I'll. I'll be damned if I'm not going to get the gosh darn best facebook live video out of this. There's literally look at the size of the hole in his head. My God, mother. Fuck. He's smiling in the picture because he's a fucking Montana dude. There are different humans. Do you remember the, uh, the bear with the karate suit guy? He just fucking knocks out the lady specials. You have a joke about that. He remembers that. He tears his bitch apart. It's horrible.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       And the other guy with the karate uniform is just decided out of nowhere. Yes sir. He just decided out of nowhere that he was going to fuck that lady up. There was no town and nobody feels bad because you put a fucking party and I met bear man. That ain't working. Yeah, that's simple. Simple as that I'm scared of animals do. And now that I have a kid too, like is this, is the video going at the karate and sits down. Oh, this is fun. Look at the size of the thing. Like, look at the power in it. When it grabs her lunch, imagine how terrified she must've been. And everyone's slapping it, bitch slapping it. The host is getting in there. Why would the host get in there? Are you crazy dudes wrestling with a bear that is a Russian who's that good technique?

Speaker 3:          01:12:13       That guy has to be rushed and look at the power in his fucking getting. He's almost got the bear. He's almost got the bear out. Jesus Christ. This is so crazy. And the bear still holding onto that person was fucking that personnel also, not even the hardest day of her life in Russia. Oh my God. She made. She must've got fucked up by that bear dude. I mean really fucked up. The bear. Didn't use great technique to get out of the team, but he just kind of powered out. The only thing that saved her life is that that bear had a muzzle on. I love that. He looks at her like she said something offensive you can't predict and that's a brown bear that's similar to a grizzly bear. Probably the Russian version of a brown bear. They have big ass bears over there. Yeah. Fuck that dude.

Speaker 3:          01:12:56       Fuck bears, dude. I've, I saw a real grizzly bear in the wild and it wasn't that far away. There was like 30, 40 yards and looked me in the eyes and I remember thinking, Whoa, that's a different look. He went, Oh shit. It's jewelry wasn't even a big one. It was only like a six foot tall grizzly, which is not a big grizzly, but it looked at me. It looked. They looked through you like, what am I going to do? Am I going to eat? You know, what am I doing? Is it safe to safe? They have their brains calculated. Do you have a weapon on you or you have two shotguns and two bows and arrows, but still I'd probably take a while to shotguns and one bone arrow. I got a shotgun. My Tas. Yeah. Yes. It would take a while. Yeah, it's not.

Speaker 3:          01:13:35       It's not that easy. It's a big animal. Even a six foot one is probably probably 300 pounds. I mean, it's a big animal, but it's the way they look at you that's different. Like I've. I've seen black bears in the wild and they look at you like, what are you, what's going on over here? What's happening? Grizzlies look right through you. They look right through you. It's a weird look. It's a weird like dead look like there's no fear of you at all. Like what do I do here? They just trying to figure out whether or not you're a meal. You're just wandering. Imagined piano. 300 pound animal that just has to wander around looking for shit to eat. Welcome to the life of big Joe.

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       Can you please stop describing the wild animals conventions I've been in my life. I mean this is a fucking crazy bear. Like you see this thing come and run because it will eat. You are human being 300 pounds that's coming at you. All you can do is put it down, put it out of their misery animal. Three hundred pounds that is hungry.

Speaker 6:          01:14:32       Imaginary, no stores

Speaker 2:          01:14:37       looking for hunters and slipping. Limps. It just like a.

Speaker 6:          01:14:44       well we, um, I was with my friend Jen, she's the guide and she smacked a fucking tree with the stick. She picked up the stick and crack this fucking tree and screamed and I screamed and we cocked our guns and that thing took off. They new fuck bitch ass. Bear Shit, we saw a couple of them, so one of them we think on the side of the road, it's got to be terrible, but with the weapons, you're like it sorta on still, you know, you don't know how many are out there and you have them out there, you know, they've, they've, they've seen one way bigger than the ones I've seen. Well, what about people that say this? It's always like the people that are like, well, yeah, if you think you're a real man, how about this? We'll give you a knife and you go out there and then you try to hunt a bear.

Speaker 6:          01:15:29       I always feel like even if you have a gun, it's going to not be that easy to just go and fucking kill a bear. But you know why all these people say that shit is because they don't understand what a bear really is. Like in their head. They feel like a bear is like some mythical creature who lives in the forest so she'd be left alone. The problem is you can't just leave them alone because they're so powerful and they're so hungry and they eat so much that if there's nothing that keeps them in check, they're gonna just run rampant and destroy all the deer and the Moose and all those other things you like to look at as well. They're going to kill all of you. They were to kill 50 percent of

Speaker 2:          01:16:08       just you can

Speaker 6:          01:16:10       kill them. Well, you're also like, you want to keep the populations healthy, like it's very tricky and humans are supposed to play a part in this. I mean there's. We don't like to think we play a part in it because we can communicate and we discuss things and we rationalize. We have culture and those are all those things are all correct, but we've always kept predators and check because when they start killing us that means, oh, we have to do something now, and then we killed them. That's always been the case with villages and Jaguars and people who live in towns and wolves. It's always been the case. There is a food chain. We're a part of it. We just have insulated ourselves from it with cities so thoroughly that we've forgot about this connection, so all these people that are peta people, a good percentage of them are living in cities. You're, you're, you're talking about a culture that you don't understand talking about a world that you I don't idealize. And when you say like we kept the predators and check like not nearly as well

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       as we do now. We always tried to do it and then after thousands of years of this struggle where we fucking got the upper hand and started dominating, it was easy to sit in a city and be like, hey, you know, you read your kids these books about nature and it's like the frog made friends with the squirrel and everything's just nice and nature were the assholes. Like people are the assholes because we pollute and we do this. And it's like, no, you know, what's the real fucking asshole is the state of nature where your fucking kid gets ripped apart by a fucking predator. That's real. That's the shit you don't want to do. Where's that fucking? Bye.

Speaker 6:          01:17:41       The answer is, man, I think the answer is comes in the middle that people have to realize the real problem on the side of people that eat meat and people that don't think Peta people are ridiculous, is factory farming. That's what's against us. The most horrific evidence is not impeded side. I mean in terms of like something that they're accused of the most horrific evidenced by far. It's coming out of these factory farms. Like if you had to pick like which side. If you look at the two of them, like which side makes more sense with the pizza side makes way more sense than the fucking factory farm people bolt are extremists. You see those videos where it's like Auschwitz of cows and doing numbers into their forearms. It's terrific. So I think the, if the meeting population doesn't accept the fact that this is, it's not just, it's should be impossible.

Speaker 6:          01:18:35       It should be impossible for a civilized, healthy person to accept this as a reality for those animals. So the Peta people are right about that. They just. But the idea that you shouldn't be able to eat any animals. Like mmm. I don't agree because what are you going to do with all these animals and the best way in terms of like health, the best way to live is eating mammals, animals, eating animals and vegetables together seems to be the best way to exist seems to be when you look at all these objective scientific studies that talk about nutrients and plants versus nutrients and animal products or leans very heavily towards a diet that's rich in of those, there's no people in the world that are fed that eat a meat, vegetables and fruit juice responsible here, dude,

Speaker 5:          01:19:22       fucked up man. I know you guys are aggressive at home. That shit. I like meat and vegetables and fruits. Joe, he's getting your shotgun, right? Like all those things. But so six foot son of a bitches coming right at Jason. Being a stick on the tree. Guys, don't nobody. You're right. And then it's also like there's some weird shit that happens to you when they go in those fucking Vegan soy diets like Jamie Kilstein started eating meat again and he's fucking making sense again. Finally.

Speaker 6:          01:19:51       Well, he also tasted the wrath of his improper inclinations. Me, improper meaning he wasn't being honest. He went along with his ideology because he was terrified of the repercussions of being against the stream and you know, he saw like Jay, I've talked about Jamie 100 times on this podcast now after we did a podcast together because he's a way more normal person now. He's way more rational. Like when he was in that world, he was frantic checking his twitter constantly, like constantly arguing with people, calling people out of being a bigot or a racist. It's like you're always trying to get street cred for calling people out. You're always constantly checking your phone and see what horrible shit they said back to you and whether or not that stings

Speaker 7:          01:20:37       you're in a battle and that you almost get addicted to that. I quit. I literally stopped using facebook like six months ago. I just deleted it because it was a lot of that. I don't really publicly battle as much on twitter with dummies, but on facebook I was really getting into it with people for stupid shit and I was just like, now that I don't do that at all, like just that weird, nasty whatever vial feeling that that gives you that you live in and you get addicted to, you want to go back to it. It just feels so much better and Jamie was definitely a victim of that, but now you talk to them because I had lunch with them before he even came back. We talked, we had lunch in La and he almost seemed broken. Dude. He seemed like he definitely seemed like he was beaten down and had been through some real fucking shit.

Speaker 6:          01:21:18       I think the social industry, I think being a social justice warrior is like exhausting. You have to be looking at that hearing is exhausting, period. If inside of you give a fuck that much, it's pretty nice. But I mean it really is like when people get angry about something like calming people get angry back comedy. It's so like, wow, you've had to. You've already through so many layers of things to actually be angry about and then some other things you shouldn't be angry about to get to comedy. They're almost always not successful or not as successful as they think they should be. Almost always no one who's successful complaints about comedy. No one who is successful is pissed off to. Kevin Hart has a fucking $50,000,000 mansion, right? No, you're absolutely right that aren't doing well. And I think, uh, and, and just kind of on a similar note, I think no one who's been through real shit in their life gives a fuck about microaggressions.

Speaker 6:          01:22:10       Like it's literally like a privileged thing and you don't have anything going on that you actually are taking this as a major issue, but you know what it also is, it's evidence that you're in competition with that person and unnecessarily so and that you are deeming them to be unworthy of their success. So you get angry, you're lashing out. And it's entirely because you feel like it's a race and you're so far behind the regular folk, the folk hart or whatever it is. It's like whoever the fuck if the person is that's way ahead of you instead of just looking at it for what it is. Wow. That guy works hard. Hold on.

Speaker 7:          01:22:44       Stressful at all in comedy. You Go, oh, this is a really fucking fair thing. Either way, whether you have a, you know the guys that have millions of millions of dollars, that's great.

Speaker 6:          01:22:52       If you're successful in comedy. Yeah. But if you're a guy coming off as like, you know, it's easy. I mean, how many times when you were around gods were just starting out. Would they talk crazy shit on some headlines or they work with. Yeah man, he couldn't even follow me, Bro. Everybody this room probably was

Speaker 7:          01:23:06       guilty of doing that as a young comment on that. Me and Dave on the phone,

Speaker 2:          01:23:11       I got called a audit by a Keith Robinson, the committee, Keith Robinson. I called him the shit talking another comic or say that I like some booker had called and said he liked me on the show and he kept talking about me and another comic that he liked. This guy's gonna be comedy anymore, but he kept acknowledging. He's like, oh, just you and that guy were my two favorites. I like youtube both. And eventually I was like, hey man. Yeah. It's just like, that guy's terrible. I was like, you keep saying the same thing. It's so weird. And I called, uh, my friend Keith Robinson, Flight Brag, not brag would almost be like, isn't this funny? He kept saying, I did this for a young comedy and he was like, dude, don't ever fucking do that because it's not your job, not your job to take money out of someone's pocket for a or just slouched and whatever it goes, if they suck that much, it'll people will find out or maybe they'll get better or whatever, but it's not your job to like cut somebody else off at the knees.

Speaker 2:          01:24:02       And I was, I took that soda. I was like, Oh shit. I was, I was a real asshole doing that. Dialyze it. You get caught. I've heard that before too. You get caught up in what you think is a competition, but you knew and all the other people that are trying to make it, but there a nice point when you get to at least where you're. You're not miserably broke all the time or you're in some at least path or lane of where you want to go. It's nice to be. It does change your appreciation for comedy. It brings it back again. It brings it back. You can just like somebody like somebody who's funny, who's way younger than you. You can like somebody who's funny who's passing you. You know what I mean? It doesn't matter. You can just like a. well, that was the thing that me. Why them, not me? Why them?

Speaker 7:          01:24:42       I want you to like laughing at like guitar acts where I think when we all came up in New York, there's like our experts, you dumb fucking hacky shit and I'm watching you the other way. Washington Reagan and mock up Jeremiah and just laughing your Dick off because you let go after a little while ago and it's not you, but it's not about your ego. It's about what's going to tickle you. There is not about the,

Speaker 2:          01:25:00       we've had this conversation a lot and I said, I think what New York lax, la embrace as much more is the silly even, you know what I mean? There's just, there's not enough like silly, uh, in New York, I feel like everyone's, if you do something silly or even pull out a guitar for whatever reason on stage, I think there's not even a chance of maybe wait, this might be like a unique or guitar,

Speaker 7:          01:25:22       you know, people will like I watched Sebastian Maniscalco in Vegas and do it. I like I watch in that hour, I don't know Sebastian or all but watching him for that hour, this is like a year ago was the most I learned in comedy and a really, really long time. He's so physical and like what he does with his body and his eyes, like he's making eye contact with almost everybody in the audience. And I was like, Holy Shit Dude. And he's got to really use that space. And I feel like in New York, if anybody was at physical, people will be like, what's this guy fucking dylan? Colin Quinn was saying this at, um, at just for laughs in 2013 he gave the keynote address to pee. So bad. I'm sorry. You're going to come back and this show's going to be off the fucking rails. Legion escapes. Takes over the

Speaker 4:          01:27:38       We're not plugging everything in our lives right now. Don't worry. Hey, what's up the bears man. Bears are crazy. I drank way too much water today. Quite an issue. Water is so hard for me to drink. It's so boring. I fucking hate it. It is boring, but it's not boring. If you were fucking dying of thirst, you gotta think if you were in a desert and you just like barely hanging on, your lips are cracked and bleeding and your skin is sore with sun blisters all over it and just wandering and you just see a fucking one of those, uh, Fiji water's in a bucket of ice for those giant ones was the nicest one. Big Ones brought a crystal light packet shut. Shut splenda. I got some emergency scorebig. Casad gotta. Keep Koolaid in my. Go back to what I had like a couple of weeks ago for the first time and fucking 20 years or some shit. When was the last time I had koolaid before that, but I was at a barbecue place and it was so good. I had to go with the Koolaid was fuck. It was sort of racist for a drink to offer at a barbecue place? No, it was a black owned business. Yeah. Yeah, they. They were doing. They were serious about it. It was in Fresno and then you've got to be careful because you want to see on the menu you go to. You guys have coined music.

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       Yeah. It was like the first drink. It's like, yeah, the all that other bullshit like Pepsi root beer if you're really interested, but she want Koolaid. You'd want to do this shit right. You can eat oxtails might as wives or Koolaid has ever Koolaid guy and I was poor. We were always like a shitty ice tea, like scoopable sugary ice tea into the. I remember that Shit. We used to do a lot of that in my home. The lemonade and the ice to realize flavored makes no sense to me. Yeah. See, I don't even know what that makes. T just cold water garbage in this tea. Iced tea. I drink unsweetened iced tea all the time. I hate it. It's like vegetable water, some phytonutrients in it. Apparently. I'd rather drink water. Yeah, the water is good man. Maybe just drink a little sparkling water.

Speaker 3:          01:29:53       Mix it up and get a little fucking Pellegrino in your system. We have the sets of fucks you up. You know, just water or whiskey either. What's a cheat day? I'm telling you right now in the best shape I was ever in my entire life. Dude. I was drinking diet coke like a motherfucker, right? ABS. And I'm sure my body on the inside is a Goddamn nightmare. Um, but I was drinking like an insane amount of diet soda. It was a problem. Really. That was how hydrate they say that Shit fucks you up in so many different ways. And one of the ways does the, all those chemicals, they're fucking terrible for your gut flora. Like even sugar's bad for your gut flora if you drink regular coke, but apparently if you drink diet coke. My Gut Flora is pretty dope though. So you say so you don't know anything about my gut flora Joe Rogan. I'm always suspicious of people were bragging about their right and I bet my uncle is a straight up psychic bro. I'm telling her mind reader, you don't have any secrets from him Bro. He looks into your eyes and she's window.

Speaker 3:          01:31:02       Yeah. He's got a neon sign in front of his house and everything. It's always the guy who's bragging the most. Got Some farty gas gut flora. What the fuck is Gut Flora? You don't know what that is for real. Are you kidding? Yeah. Gut Flora. Your um, your stomach has living organisms. I'm sorry. Don't act like you guys fucking. No. A Gut Flora was sure he knows I was going to explain it, but joe got it. Oh, joe do it. It's a show that please check the lighting. It's the Flores Flores. Am I pronouncing it right? But pronounced. It might be your actual life forms. There's more eco lie in your gut than they've ever been. People ever. That's fact. Your Gut, your gut sign. We are. We are. We're a ecosystem. Every human being is an ecosystem. We're not a one thing. You cannot exist without the bacteria in your system, without what's on your skin, protecting you from other invading bacteria.

Speaker 3:          01:32:06       We're in a sea of life forms that are floating through the air and we ca. That's why you get sick. If you touch things and you touch your face, you're literally taking life forms in your body that wants to go to war with your immune system. Somewhere like deep there when you're getting just like a rash, there's just like some dude arguing with his check or it was like, get off my back. All right. And leaving and the rash, that's what it is. They had a fucking gang fight in the middle of your face and became a Zit. That's where cancer. I've said this for the longest time. That's where cancer comes from. You put shit in your body that's not supposed to be there. And when they, uh, what's his name? Said he got mouth cancer for being now. Catherine said, yeah, dude, I'm talking.

Speaker 3:          01:32:41       We're not. We're not supposed to get it from her. Well, he said that he got it from eating a lot of. First of all, he said he didn't really say that and that people have distorted what he originally said. Well, because he was talking like this, it would be like the first guy ever. Imagine if it was Michael Douglas was the first guy ever to get mouth cancer from eating pussy. Be like, whoa. I think that's a real thing, but it's the best. It's the best reason to give for having mouth cancer. Like how'd you get that mouth? Camels. Bad Ass was eating tons of lack a motherfucker. Remember that trap and trailer has sucked it right out of that square to cancer. All over my face, hot and in the mouth like right down the hatch, a carnival clown mouth or once every six weeks ago. Grind off what's in there. Go ahead. Getting back to work in the morning, Sammy Down Lyoto came gargle to smooth that bitch down.

Speaker 3:          01:33:35       Always play. Give me a cortisone shot in this thing. I got an 11 at home, crawling off the walls. This bitch is crazy and she's hot as the sun, so I'm going back to work once that pussy sucked. Your doctor wants to know because without warning, wanting to get too specific, this particular cancers caused by HPV, which actually comes from cunnilingus amongst other things, but he took it back, so don't worry if stress caused my son's income. Oh, stress caused by my son's incarceration. Didn't help trigger it. But yeah, it's a sexually transmitted disease. It causes cancer. Interesting. I'm telling you, dude, HP, you're not supposed to put our dicks and are and shut your mouth. Shut your mouth. Fun. Killer platform. Get every time. I'm 60, 90 with my check. I'm like, we're just given each other kids right now and it makes me a little bit harder.

Speaker 3:          01:34:32       If you didn't, you have like a cancer doctor has to charge you like smoking cigarettes and be like, Louis, if you're going to keep eating pussy, I can't see you anymore. That's probably exactly what it's going to be. One day I just picked kiss their clit the whole time. That's a good move. See, the thing is now they have a vaccine, so now you get that hpv vaccine you never have to worry about. You have to go. Yeah, so they're giving it to young. Yup. Good dudes and girls. Oh Man, it's a vaccine, but it come a risky one. It's

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       like there's some side effects and some people had, you know, depending on your biology. Some people are pretty extreme side effects apparently. Like people who have gotten really sick from that. A HPV vaccine that happens with almost all the vaccines. Those certain people get really sick them. Yeah. I mean this is the problem with this whole anti vaccine movement is like they're not. They don't understand the nuanced details of what it means to take an entire population of 300 million people and try to figure out a vaccine that's going to protect them from disease. It's not going to work on everybody. There's going to be people that don't jive with it. There's going to be people that are allergic to some of the stuff that's in it is going to be people that have weird biological reactions. These are the outliers and like you have to be willing to accept a certain amount of outliers.

Speaker 6:          01:35:44       Unfortunately, if you want to protect people from polio and and all these different fucking crazy diseases that they've really got a good grip on measles. Up until recently measles, they had it locked down. Nobody was getting measles anymore, but all these fucking hippies decided not to vaccinate their kids and now measles are coming back because they're worried about autism, but at the same time dads are getting older and older. These 54 year old dudes are having babies and you're like, hey man, like this. This is. This is way more of your problem than probably most vaccinations. As soon as we statistically old sperm mix, kids will left hands but to vaccinations have fuck people up to. It's like both things are true. Like vaccinations are very important numbers though. Take. You have to look at it and go, all right dude. You know, but there's also been like, I mean there's been a real extensive research to disprove the idea that the vaccinations are the reason for the autism, but I can understand it just like a human instinctual way. Imagine you have a baby, you get your baby vaccinated. There's nothing goes more against your instincts than to give your baby to a stranger and let them prick you with like everything in you is telling you this is a bad idea and then your kid's sick over the next year. I think it's very easy. Just psychologically it'd be like, well that's what fucking happened.

Speaker 4:          01:36:59       When I gave him to that guy and he fucking prick them. That's the reason my son isn't circumcised was because he was born at three in the morning and they were going to do it the next day. And when I brought, I had held him and I loved them. I looked at him in the face if they were going to do it right away, I like take them. I cut them. I don't give a fuck. I don't want that. But now he hit anyway. Squeezed at the beginning to have the kids had a look at the top of squeezy pussy. All you want to do with that pussy squeeze, squeeze, squeeze my son's fucking head. You can't help it. You gotta squeeze it tight. Fucking ramp head hanging out. They came back the next day. They're like, are we going to take them now? And I mean I, I mean I had fucking hung out with him. He's my son. I loved him at that point so much. So take me to a strip club already. Chicken also implanted in my mind all of these babies circumcision videos where she made me watch and it's a thing dude.

Speaker 5:          01:37:55       Yeah. And it's terrible. It's a barbaric practice that people only do because it was done to them and because we feel like it's part of tradition and I agree. They have these bullshit stories. Bell or goal hope or are you trying to shut up? You're not getting HIV that they did that. They did a study in Africa where they took like a few hundred people in a fucking straight up a place in Africa where it was like one out of every four people had aids and they proved that circumcising them was stopping the transmission of aids because there's not as many breaks in the for skin, so it's not as easy to transmit the disease. But we were talking about a third world country where they're cleaning their bodies. We don't live in that same type of poverty or fucked up like disease. If you look at any of the justifications for circumcision, they're all super weak. None of them actually, you know, they'll say these things where it's like, well, you can't get cancer in, in your for skin or something like that. And you're like, yeah, and if you just lopped off chicks breasts, they can't get breast cancer, but we're still not going to just preemptively be like, let's just fucking start castrating people. It changes the sensitivity of your Dick. Uh, Dick supposed to be slippery at the top. I mean, while you pull that for skin away, it just dries up like an old piece of gum.

Speaker 5:          01:39:06       Not supposed to be like that. We've lived with literally change with Dick's feel like when they go into people's bodies, it is gross. When you describe an uncircumcised Dick is self-lubricating you. That's how they got the business done back in the day. It is a, but that's the way my Dick Hangs soft. I could. I would hate having for skin. You'd get over it. Just that. Would you rather that or no deck that or no deck for a new force come back or. No. Oh, of course. Yeah, so just let it go too. Extreme ends of the rainbow. That's how I live. If I take it back, I don't know if I can go back now and just write what. I just take my. If a genie came out, the gas. Jeanie, Eric came in and said, we're gonna have one wish and it's just about your pretty specific wishes back.

Speaker 5:          01:39:55       Let's see what's up. You're going to get cut again if you're a crazy asshole or they also to do it in less than it would be your decision reconstructive surgery they have for it to pull shit. I've seen what they do. They take clothes, pins, they pull your dick apart down, stretch the skin out around your Dick, and it becomes kinda like a forest. Like instead of like being one piece of meat, it's like a double piece in a rolled up. Like ghostface killer webster was hanging in his closet to try to make himself taller. All the grocer shit about four skin is accentuated by the fact that it's a double. It's essentially like the whole skin of the deck has to go over the top of the deck. It's outrageous. They did it. They did a penn and teller bullshit about that. Oh, that's easy. They're so into it, but here's the thing we should do and congratulations to you for doing that. Don't circumcise your kids anymore. It's crazy. Got To stop. That's really weird and fucked up. It's dangerous. It's not 100 percent dangerous, but it might

Speaker 3:          01:40:53       be one out of a thousand kids. Get some sort of an infection and they could lose their dick that happens to you, and then they do a session that's a regular thing that happens when it happens. They fuck up their dicks circumcision, they get the infection and then they say, all right, well now you can have a baby with no dick and have it be a boy or we can sexual sexual reassignment to be a girl. And kids find out years later that they were born a boy. And that's why that happened. There's actually a famous case, there's a famous case about that where they did a botched circumcision. The kids penis was removed and then they decided to give him a sexual reassignment and everyone was fucking terrified of it. It didn't work. The kid became massively, massively depressed and then wound up committing suicide, uh, as an adult and just just felt robbed of reality.

Speaker 3:          01:41:39       You know, by what, by some crazy, stupid, avoidable ritual. Are you going to cut baby dicks because you think it looks better. And, and in the best case scenario, even when all that shit doesn't happen, you're torturing a baby. I mean, how else could you describe using Novacane? We're not saying like you're not, but if anyone, if you ever had a surgery like that and they were like, oh, we're just going to put some local. I mean like no one does gang. So bad. You're so sensitive. You don't even know what pain is. Your little tiny one dale person when someone's cutting your dick already, like what kind of a world of I've been fucking does to you in that moment where you're like, we don't know the type of psychological damage that that causes in that moment. There's a real intense pain there in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:42:22       They want their mom. They want to be held against her mom's breast. They want to be feeding with their mom. They want the love right now. That's what they're supposed to get and you take them and you fucking mutilate them. Who knows what type of switch you turn on in that fucking babies had in that moment. Yeah. You make Jewish people start all the wars. They decided they decided to fucking really good at finance and the diamond business and they were like one of the first people to be circumcised. Like the Jewish people you always assume were circumcised. Right? Why is that? It's just part of the code, but there's no. No one really knows. Any reason where I was trying to save a little, you know, is the most horrific you ever watched the circumcision rituals they do in Africa. It. I've seen a few of them. Oh my God, there's a video of this dude just standing there, standing there, balls ass naked, and the guy comes over, grabs his dick, grabs this with one swipe of the blade, shoot, takes off the forest, can pulls on his dick and slices away and yanks it off and the guy stands there completely.

Speaker 3:          01:43:24       Stone face doesn't react, and that's part of the ritual is Dana White Wilson. So you want to be an ultimate fighter. His Dick is bleeding and he's just standing there. He's not looking at it and it's not a good circumcision cut either. It's totally fuck. It's like peeling an orange, right? You're never going to get a straight line. It's really lit and looks like this poor guy's Dick. It's, it's. So if you see the Jamie, do you know the video saved on my

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       fingers, the Jewish ceremony where the rabbi isn't the right by like suck blood or something. That's a dick. Yeah, like every. It's not that every Jew doesn't do that, but there's Dick sucked by a rabbi. Yeah. I might've. Have you done any babysitter, Dick Sucking cock. I brought this up three years ago

Speaker 7:          01:44:11       on the show and I'm the only person doing any research on our show. I may seem like I'm the dumbest one, but I promise you right now you're almost prepared. Dumbest one. I'm the one doing the research. I brought this up and everyone looked at me like I'm an asshole. And I'm like, no, I swear to God. Rabbis are out there sucking babies. Dicks and you guys were your

Speaker 6:          01:44:25       videos. Are you justifying it? You gave a headline thing because they had to. There was some serious problems with it. Oddly enough, because of herpes, because babies were getting herpes and dying from herpes, from rabbi sucking their Dick after they performed this circumcision and apparently in some versions of Judaism it's part of the ritual and that this guy was explaining it and like in Yiddish and he was explaining all the different things that what's important that the rabbi or the WHO have the mo l performs this. I think he said it to tsetse. He had like a word for it. Oh, you mean the bulls? He says a nice old word for sucking baby dicks. You just cut. I mean it's, it's so the only in religion. Do you have a youtube video where you're dressed like a wizard talking about sucking baby dixit. You just cut and.

Speaker 6:          01:45:15       Well this is a part of our tradition, but do you think it's an argument like you're not just some fucking like dress and like making like singing some song. You're actually going like, well this is what I have to. Have you seen it? Do you think it's definitely sinister? No, it's retarded always. Or is it just like it's fucking stupid. They're stuck in it and someone did it to him and someone did it to his dad and they feel like they're a part of this clan. It's fucking. And you feel like if you were to give up on that, you're giving up on your dad, your family. Everything's alive, so you got to just blindly believe that this is what you did to retard the progress. It retards progress. It is. It literally is retarded. Like in that sense, like forget about the derogatory term you used for people.

Speaker 6:          01:45:56       It's a retarded idea. It retards logic. You're cutting a baby dick and sucking on it. Then you're making a youtube video saying, well, but when we thought the world was flat, this is how we do. We still do it this way and we like to cut it and we like to fuck when we have a name for it. It's not that I make with my mouth that's different than sucking cut baby. I've judged is very important. A rose by any other name I say. Yeah, I mean it was crazy that someone could sit around and justify doing some shit to a baby's deck. Just because they've always done it, but I think all but two have Jackie Mason to it, like a reasonable rate. Just a little bit. I mean is if it's any better to cut it and not suck it, like at least maybe it feels better for the kid to. Honestly, if you're going to stick, give a blowjob

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       standpoint. You would definitely want somebody to suck your Dick after you got to cut. But how, what kind of a person just sucks baby dicks all the time. Like how many baby you took an average rabbi. There's done this or what it was it a moral moral oil more was my. Well, so like a shoe company or something that's close to whale, but these how many baby dicks in a lifetime and a strong career? Thirty five year career working for the synagogue. How many baby dicks have you started going to college and have numbers? Imagine that you go to college in Arizona. Is that matter? She's got license, particularly sledding. Could you imagine if she testifies like a Nazi and Nuremberg goes. I was following orders. I had to was a website and you just see like it just scrolled and you know that bar on the right side. The dot was really tiny. A lot to do. It's all the baby dixie sucked over the years. I kept an elbow, but he told me it was the best chicken, my page, my. Anyway, so Jamie do not show us that son of a bitch. Her check. How's that online? Is that on youtube and it's. There's blood everywhere. There's a cut it. There's blood everywhere and the baby's screaming and the guy sucks. The baby's Dick. Congratulations. You're an idiot.

Speaker 3:          01:48:07       Sorry for cutting your Dick though. This is one of those things that because it's a part of a religion, people get mad if you take it down. People get mad if you shit on it, but you. This is one of the. If you see, there's no clear indication that your religion is gone completely off the track. That if you're cutting baby dixon, then sucking them. Anybody in their right mind outside of that religion saying we can do to Charlie. Thinking about cutting David Dixon, sucking him. What's it called? The MTI and the CIA. Yeah. Here's what's fucked up. That's on youtube. Look, yeah, there's a lot of Jewish people that are watching their families, babies getting their dicks cut and then such, but then there's also a whole set of pedophile vampires that are watching that and just beating off to it all day long. Some fucking guy who taught his dog to Heil Hitler and he's looking at jail time.

Speaker 3:          01:48:53       But you could suck a baby's Dick on youtube. It's your fucking video. Go Up. Yes. You want to stop baby dicks, but I want to go to jail. Oh, become a rabbi Jamie. Get that down. Show you. There's a bunch of son of a bitch. There's hundreds of them. Hundreds of guys suck. And Baby Dick's when it's 2018. This is not a Jewish religion. We're not living in the barbarian times, but today people are cutting in sucking baby dick. How about genital female genital mutilation for it? How much act for two. Please say that anymore, man. Yes, you can march. It's march. I'll wait. Oh, it's a female as of April. It's off and mutilation month. What month is it a female empowerment month? What is it? Is it. Is there one of those nights of Hispanic month, Hispanic heritage month. There was a. There was a national woman's Day. Right. I stayed off every year and I'm not saying Shit, don't play in traffic. I'm definitely not going to say anything. Just snotty, you know, trying to be cute. You don't need to say anything. I wouldn't. Benjamin is handling it for all of us. Women's history month, Hispanic Saturday, March 30. First we're celebrating. So this is women's history month.

Speaker 3:          01:50:17       The fucked up thing is black history month. The shortest month. Yeah. That was definitely some passive aggressive racist shit. Percent hundred percent keep dam an extra bone in the wreck. What makes them history harder? So like at what point in time is that going to end? Like how, how long in the future would it be before we didn't have black history month. Like we're not going to have like a Moore's history month for people. Right? So you're saying black people are going to go extinct at a certain point and we won't have to. I think all people are going to go extinct at a certain point and I pray. I bet it's probably within a thousand years. I just don't think so. I hope you don't feel are months like fucking frat parties. That's true too, but I just think like what point in time we're going to not care. I mean if you.

Speaker 3:          01:51:05       If there's a way like let's just imagine is it even humanly possible to engineer the education of human beings to the point where there's no more. Racism doesn't exist anymore. No more sexism, no more homophobia. Naturally we were tribes and we gravitate toward people that look like us and we're comfortable with. I remember in kindergarten shore, this is 1987, we were allowed to just choose our tables because it didn't make you sit where you no assigned seats or whatever and I remember all the white kids just sat with the white kids and the black kids sit with the black kids and Hispanic and says with the Hispanic kids and I'm half white and I was raised by white people and you see little Puerto Rican may just plopped in the middle of this white table and all these little kids probably like, what the fuck is this kid doing here?

Speaker 3:          01:51:45       But it was very much like everyone's segregated racially and it was very natural. You're a kid. I'm talking about as a grown adult who's already examined the world, don't you think it's possible to people to get to the point where they don't do that anymore? I just let it go. I think individuals can, but the idea that in terms of large demographic groups, there won't be any in group preference and there won't be any. Maybe I'm not closed off to it, but it seems like a real tough goal. I agree with you 100 percent, but I'm more, I'm more leaning towards that now than ever before because of the Internet because I think people are accelerating, accelerating what they understand about what's going on in the world. It's just, it's way more deep like for you've talked to average 20 year old today and they're just way more knowledgeable than I was when I was 20, like stunningly. So like even if they believe ridiculous shit, they. Yeah, because they have the information. I mean because it's like if I like it for me to have, I wouldn't know half the shit. I know if I grew up, you know, decades before I did, I wasn't going to go to the library every fucking care. Yeah. Yeah. It's like I wasn't going to put that in, but when it's right in front of you, it's

Speaker 7:          01:52:46       like, all right, well I guess I can spend two to 5:00 AM, but I think we're going towards that. It seems like the sharing of information is sort of making us move away from that. It seems like it's making us more erratic and more kind of crazy. You know, I feel like we don't know how to like, you know, people don't know how to quickly share an idea and deal with people reacting to that idea. Um, as fast as it's happening. I think it's creating a lot of people like that are, you know, we speak of friends who like, like this, owning each other on facebook and publicly been like, fuck you dude, if you believe this, I don't ever want to talk to you again. You're like, dude, Whoa, where am I supposed to talk about some of the Shit I thought whatever happen to like water cooler conversation.

Speaker 7:          01:53:22       You weren't supposed to talk about politics or religion or any of this stuff. You're kind of supposed to just leave each other's lives and, and sort of like live with each other and, and, you know. Yeah. Well, I remember thinking about this when the, um, the thing with a chick filet, which by the way is delicious, but uh, when they, when they, yes, solid my favorite class, but when they, when they were like against gay marriage and people are like boycotting chick filet and you're just kinda like, well, what, what is the precedent that you're setting here? Like if I pull up to a gas station and I go to like a snack, do I have to go? Like, so where do you stand on the Iraq war? Where do you stand on? It isn't the point that we all can kind of get along even if we have wild.

Speaker 5:          01:54:03       Yeah. But we would like to spend our money wisely knows the ideas that people are voting with their dollars. Right? I get that. But it's almost like now we can have all that knowledge and, and like I get your point, but it can work toward us being inclusive or it can work toward us being like, well no, I'm not gonna fuck with anybody who doesn't meet x, Y, z beliefs going on, which isn't, isn't necessarily great. No, because it's like there's something beautiful about like, uh, the market where like I'm, I'm a Jew, but I can like, you know, get a cab in New York from a Muslim and I'm just like, oh, I'm going up here, and then he drops me off and he's like, have a good night. God bless. And I'm like, thank you. And we give each other money. Happy place is such a melting pot though. It's so different than la La. Everybody's in their own car. They go to their own building and insulated. In New York, you're forced to walk with people, getting the train with people. Everybody's all together. The subway, 9:00 AM at

Speaker 7:          01:54:59       34th street. You have a million people in one small area where it's like one person's a homeless person. Next person is a multimillionaire, supermodel actor from every different area life and they're all squished together in La. You got to go to the party to hang out with that model or actor to, to interact with them really in any way. You don't have a lot of examples outside of actor and model.

Speaker 5:          01:55:21       You said that in home construction workers? Never found like just like a cashier or somebody living the dream. I feel battles.

Speaker 7:          01:55:32       If you guys want to take an uber back, if you guys are going to stay and hang out and keep. Sorry I have to go because I have to go through bonfire. I have to go to series six. Seven. What time do you gotta be there? Uh, we have to be there like, like 2:40. Oh, zero k

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       dude. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's a Dan soder show isn't deep. Sirius Xm radio program. Yes. Yeah. I love that show. On the side. On the satellite radio. Well we can either keep going for a little bit and talk mad shit about Jay. Oh, I'd love that. That'd be fun. He'll be fine. Well we can just wrap this up then. I can keep going on their I podcast. I got a lot of shit about Jay to talk. Thanks very much for having this facilitating this. Absolutely mad you guys have together. I love you brother. So she's been a prick all week. The door. That was poor etiquette. I liked his half hair red better by buddy jamie. Did you get the release people try and make sure I don't have any. Your car. That's. I like how you rocking the old school chain with the keys. It's not connected to a wallet. Let it go. It's not connected to anything. It's just a fashion accessory. I swear to God, no wallet. It's got a chain, uh, marches to the beat of his own drum living in Greece movie.

Speaker 3:          01:56:46       It's fucking dudes that like would wear those like 19 fifties type clothes. Like roll the cuffs up. Their jeans. Were those old school shoes? Yeah. Sometimes I get a little like, you just kind of wish you lived one life in every generation. We don't want to just experience that a little bit and know what that's about. Oh my God, it must have been amazing. Sixties would've been so cool. Just like when I get like the counterculture movement first happened and like music was just awesome and like the late sixties was like, that was just like a cool time to be on it. But I have fat thighs so I could never wear the pants that were available from it at the time. You could wear them, bro. You just got to get him going to plead it out. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:57:25       That was tougher to do in the seventies and sixties before the Internet. You couldn't find your specific. Very true. What's up with people that want to go back to those arrows so bad. They get those really bad tattoos. You know those like Ed Hardy look and tattoos. Like what the fuck are you drawing on yourself? It's like some of those are so bad, but it's like purposely bad artwork. It's supposed to mimic a time period, but it's like your body is not a museum though. Okay. If you want to mimic that time period, she get a fucking picture from that time period and put it on the wall. There's creativity, pirate ship on your ass. People know people I've been established for almost like before any of that time period. Like where it's just like you'll see the pictures from the fifties or something where it's just like the dudes wore suits. The girls that these dresses like almost like. I'd like to experience that for a little bit. Just wearing a suit and a top hat, flipping a quarter of all my fucking six foot four and 120 pounds. We want to wear a suit to exact measurements. Were watching this Jack Jack Johnson fight on on video from like, what was it like the early 19 hundreds and everyone in the audience had a one of those hats. Those gentlemen hats that they wear. They all wear the same hat. Everybody had

Speaker 4:          01:58:41       a hat on. Like every guy, every guy in the audience has thousands of people. They all those dress up hats on. Oh, Jack Jones has got to find a ground out there. Look at all the hats to the same hat. I'll tell you right now, everybody's got the same hat on even today. It's like accessorizing for a dude is like the best look. You throw in like a watch and like a nice like hat and like just little things they make. It puts a dude together like a check. You want his little shit on her responsible. You want it to be as close to naked as possible, but we don't give a shit about accessories. None of that stuff, but a woman, when they look at us and they see like a watch to like, oh, this guy's got money. Louis J dot Gomes. Lights. Fucking dudes were a lot of jewelry. If I'm going to fuck him, man. Accessorize very well. I have twoish. Rewatch, jokey. Stop when Jay until listed on continuing to tell the world is on accessorizing. Nah, man. Jay can leave. We'll keep this magic going. So what's I say? That's a good point. What is harder than to do with the watch? You guys get what I'm saying? Sure. Jay Calls me later. He's like, hey, how'd the rest of the show go? Go. We all just started sucking each others' time in earrings and shit.

Speaker 4:          02:00:01       Scarves and 19 fifties. Tattoos. Roller girls. Roller Derby girls. Yeah. I think people that get those tags, that style, like if they go, I want to, uh, you know, this old style tattoo, it's a lack of creativity. They just want to fit into a certain type of thing. They want to look like a type of person with that Tattoo. They saw another dude at one point and they were like, I want to look like that guy, and then so it's like you're saying it's the same thing as the shirts and the hats. Basically it's the same thing. It's just trying to look like the next guy or just trying to like fit into the fucking thing. It's like whether it's a suit and a hat, it's just a fucking, oh no, now I'll get a tattoo. Now I'll get this. And you see that with a lot of people.

Speaker 4:          02:00:37       It was a lot of people in la, in New York, you see that a lot where someone's got like a crazy different look, but you're like, but you were just trying to fit into that girl. Yeah, but it's all the same thing, man. You're just high school and I was nominated. We're not goth, but it was borderline goth in high school can be borderline goth. It was because there was a goth kids. It didn't really accept me. He's on the spectrum. You've got spectrum three five. That's what I used to wear, like Marilyn Manson tee shirts and I had long hair and eyeliner, Europe of the world, but the goth kids weren't really like taken in. There were those my crew. Okay. Um, but yeah, you want it to just be a part of something and everyone was like, oh that guy so unique or weird, but I just looked like 100 other kids at the mall that shop at hot topic. That's a big problem with young people wanting to be a part of something. You know? I was listening to Sam Harris podcast with Christian ecoline. He was a white power guy who was recruited into these white nationalist when he was like 14. Just the podcast detailing these horrific fucking events that this

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       guy went through and horrific violence against black people. He just got sucked into being in a group when he was 14 and here he is now in his 40 years after leaving super open and honest about it and talking about it, you're like, wow. And it makes you realize like this smart guy that you're hearing talking at 40 could have been that guy at 14. They got sucked into the group. Like it's not. It isn't really not even whether or not you're smart. It's whether or not you have life experience where you, you know, the path you go down. Because this luck, dude, I'm telling you right now, you are just a product of your environment. You could turn left when you should've turned right one day and then your whole fucking life is a whole different thing. APPS, you know, died some fucked up shit as a teenager that it's like it just, I happened to land here but I could have easily just been in jail or a bit of criminal or are legitimately hurt.

Speaker 6:          02:02:29       People went down a much different path. Well that's the crazy thing when people like kind of a like they have so much like hatred towards someone else for having a different view than them or being in a different situation and you're like, dude, just understand. You were like two little circumstances away from being mad at God. I see that a lot with people and I'm on the side of like gun rights, like I'm not for gun, but the people who are like really shitty to these teenage kids who are like becoming famous and you're like, dude, if you were a fucking teenager and you could have just been on the fucking news and everyone's praising you because you take this position, sub, we'd all fucking do that exact same thing. Yesterday I was talking about one of these nra guys that was mocking these kids.

Speaker 6:          02:03:05       I'm like, you're out of your fucking mind. If anybody should be talking about. We got to do something. It's kids that got shot at. I mean this is. They got. They have the floor now. I understand. You're supposed to have the floor. I mean they just got shot at. They lost their friends and they are standing up and maybe they're not informed about a lot of issues. Maybe they don't know what a semiautomatic or an ar 15 is. Maybe they don't know those details, but they know that no one's doing shit and people keep getting shots and the kind of biomass because they survived. They got lucky. They just fucking one on the right place, but I was talking about that Maryland one and we like. You don't talk about the positive ones. Yes, but you know, because again, tell the story. So more or less.

Speaker 6:          02:03:42       In Maryland there was, there was a school shooting or a kid came into school with a gun, but they had an armed security guard. He took them out. Nobody died. Military Training Guy got rid of him quick and that's what the NRA advocates are saying like, hey, this is a good thing. We should. We should have someone who's an armed and ready responder at the school to prevent this kind of shit from happening and there's a lot of veterans that would take that job happily and you would have your kids 100 percent safe and people are like, no, that's not the solution. The solution is take the guns away. I don't like the idea of armed security at school. I don't like the idea of doctors, I don't like the idea of arming teachers, but it's like to just dismiss that and be like, no gun control. The only reasonable measure I think is naive. But just to the point, like you were saying before, I have no problem with people being like, hey, cnn shouldn't just be putting these kids on without having someone to rebut it or they shouldn't be putting this on and just say, but to go at the

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       kid and be like, oh, this kid's fucking, you know, just milking this experience like whatever. Any of us would do a thing like that.

Speaker 7:          02:04:46       Look, I, you know, I, I don't, I don't have a horse in the race. I don't really give a shit. I don't really shoot guns and I know he's the only one I've shot guns. It's just been really fun. There's no part of me that like, I think I would swallow it a little more of people that like were really a big gun advocates, which is kind of admit that like, dude, it's pretty awesome. We want to blow shit up. It's fucking great. You know? Um, but you get this other sort of thing where I just think that you should have people that are really trained, really responsible and we should have specific measures in place in order and I know we do have that, but maybe we should look at it and push that line back even a little bit more because yeah, you're right. Even in the example of the dude, you know, taking out that kid in that school, I don't necessarily have an issue with having an armed security guard at the school to protect children, but I kind of have an issue with somebody who you don't know when his girlfriend broke up with him and when this dude went bat shit. Right. So even when you have to get people's psychological exams, like when do they go crazy? When is there a moment where somebody snaps and now they're fucking crazy, right? I actually, I'm

Speaker 5:          02:05:41       really against gun control of just about any kind. I know. I actually think when people, a lot of times Republicans will go, it's not about gun control, it's about mental health. I think that's even more of a copout because you're like, what the fuck are you even saying by that? Like what do you, you know, there's lots of, when you say mental health, it's like there's lots of people who suffer from anxiety and depression, all these things. It doesn't mean they're a risk to others. Like what? What are you actually going to say? Like I'm for unfettered gun rights, but everyone has to have like a psychological exam and it's as if there's some way that we can predict who's going to shoot up a fucking school. And the truth of the matter is it's really fucking tough. It definitely is. But what you're saying is entirely correct because it is absolutely about mental health and you have to be fucking crazy to be a school shooter.

Speaker 5:          02:06:24       Yeah. And most of these people are on some sort of psychiatric medicine. There's a giant percentage of them. So it is in fact a mental health issue because there are there literally on most of them, like the vast percentage of them are on mental health medication. So the question is whether or not it's the mental health medication that's causing them to do this shit or whether or not they were already crazy and that medication was just trying to treat this disease and they got ahold of guns and that's the problem is the guns. Yeah. So maybe I didn't say that like precisely enough because I agree with everything you just said. I'm just making the point that the idea that it's like, oh all we know is that there's this category of people who have mental health issues and they shouldn't be allowed to get guns is way too broad.

Speaker 5:          02:07:03       But no, I actually, I think again, like you mentioned earlier, it's like dude, they say these. Anyone who's real fucked up nowadays as a lot of mental health issues a lot and is in school, they're going to put them on trucks. They put anyone who's borderline on drugs. So the really fucked up kids on like a cocktail of drugs and no admit with a lot of these antidepressants, anti psychotics that they can cause suicidal tendencies. Some of you will even say they cause homicidal tendencies. So I think it's pretty reasonable that maybe in some very small percentage of them they cause you to just fucking

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       want to go, or they push you at least in the direction of wanting to go, just shoot up a bunch of people to relief the, relieve you of the feeling of consequences. There's, they're there, they disassociate you from whatever you're experiencing. That's one of the most disconcerting things about the idea that if someone has homicidal thoughts but they're keeping them at bay, and then they take some pill that saying, hey, fuck it, let's do this. Let's do this. You're not exercising the whatever, the mental processes of not killing people on your own. You need this thing to do it and then you don't have your medication. One day I heard you talk about this the other day was kind of interesting. I forget who was on people whose metzker or somebody, but you were talking about people that she was very calm, cool and collected, relaxed on that episode.

Speaker 3:          02:08:18       It was weird. The best, uh, the best advertisement for Caveman nitrile you could possibly, it will make you into a raving madman. The Maryland school shooter was killed by his own bullet, not the school resource officer. Police said, oh, he shot himself in the head when the guy was coming after him. Okay. But still kind of a similar moral of the story that maybe the guy behind him made him shoot himself and this is definitely not the same story. The story was that this arm, God took him out. Yes. That's what. That's what I heard as well. That's what I had heard. I had heard a deceptive version of it then because I heard that this guy engaged in a firefight with this kid and killed him instantly. Yeah. That's what I read. Like six different articles that said that. Yeah. Okay. So that maybe that's incorrect or there's too many things to pay attention to.

Speaker 3:          02:09:03       Is a shot. Hit the shooters gun in his hand. His shot hit the shooters gun before having to shoot. Shoot her, shot himself. He shot himself with a gun that got shot. I said the officer, the officer shot struck rollins gun, which was in the teens hand. The sheriff's office said, nevertheless, his quick action confronting rollins. Just three minutes after the shot to students has been credited with bringing the incident to a quicker. So the guy did shoot the kid. Yeah, but they, he hit his gun. Killed him. Yeah. So he, he shot him and then when the. After the guy shot him, he just shot himself while he's still could praise.

Speaker 3:          02:09:41       Praise came even when it was unclear which shot killed the teen, but he definitely seems like he shot him. I mean, he was in the fire. He really wasn't a firefight with this fucking guy. I don't know, Dude. I look, I think there's not a single answer to any of this. I think it is definitely a mental health issue. I think you're not gonna. Nobody's gonna come up with a law that's going to figure all this shit out. I just, I don't live. I joked about it before, but I, I kind of lived my life in a sort of ignorance is bliss state with this type of shit. I mean, I don't know. I, I have to guess my kid's not going to be shot to death in a school one day. Knock on wood. Right. I know, and it's, and it's a horrible, horrible thing. Um, but the reality is I don't know if these people that are so obsessed with everything and just they're making it their lives, I almost feel like they're kind of missing the point if I, my, my kid isn't gonna be out at a rally holding a sign and I'm not spending my days doing that with them. I'm spending my days creating memories with him and just trying to spend my life making a good life

Speaker 7:          02:10:34       and I'm not really politicizing anything with my five year old.

Speaker 6:          02:10:37       Well, well, there's people that feel like they want to do something to want change. They don't want this to happen again. And if you lost your kid, he'd probably feel that way to me. Oh yeah, sure. I mean there's, there's, there's way too many of these things is way too many of them. So we got to figure out what it is. I think the real issue resolved realize rather, um, it, it lies. Here's one, one giant part of the problem. Everybody's looking at the final piece of the puzzle, the final piece of the puzzle. It all comes together. Is the school shooting? What gets someone to that position? How do they get to that? You gotta go to step one, not to step 10. Step 10 is a school shooting you gotta, you gotTa. Figure out how do we get less people to go from step one to step two?

Speaker 6:          02:11:18       How do we keep more people happy as young people? How do we give more people support headed when we give more people therapy or exercise or recreation or friendship or community guidance or whatever the fuck we're doing, where we alienate people to the point where they literally want to go and shoot everybody else. It's like the, the, the physical equivalent of like flipping over a game when you're losing, you know, I, I think, yeah, that's a great analogy by the way. I think that's exactly what it is. It's like, oh, this world is so bad for me. Well Fuck, you can make it for everybody. Fuck that. Nice teacher. I've thought I completely agree with what you're saying and I think maybe the silver lining in this, like the best thing that could come out of this and it has nothing to do with the law, is just that kids in high school will think twice before they're brutally ostracizing some other kid because you're like, hey, watch out. That kid might be the one who

Speaker 7:          02:12:08       maybe not people. Kids think they're invincible. They're not thinking about that. I remember when I, you know, columbine was so such a big news story when I was. I was in high school, I believe at the time. I'm sure. Yeah. It's your birthday. Actually. My birthday real fucked up and dude, it was fucking, it was such a big deal. I had never seen anything like that before. Um, this is before nine slash 11. Nine slash 11 was the next big, big thing. But it happens so often now that because of the Internet, I almost feel like people are also desensitized to like how crazy it was because columbine dude, it was bizarre watching the images on the news of the people of running out of that school. It was like haunting and I remember watching it and my mom made this point and shoot my mom a fucking drug addict, lunatic. But she had these weird little moments in her life when she said some crazy shit. And she was like, yeah. She like, you know what? Yeah, maybe they shouldn't have fucked with those kids just in a weird way. And I was like, Oh damn, I'm really good at defending these like, but you just kinda. It wasn't defending the active people getting killed, but it was sort of looking at the root with which is what you're saying. And, and she, you know, she's kind of made that point. I kind of always stuck with me

Speaker 6:          02:13:13       even more than like, which I get the point, but even more than other kids bullying him. The truth is if you want to get it the route you want to be like, Hey, parents fucking love your kids and give them a really good childhood. But it's like, how do you actually make that happen? There's a narrative, difficult natural inclination that animals have to pick on the weaker ones. It's a terrible natural of the human beings have to avoid because chickens do it. I've chickens, chickens, fuck. With the smaller chickens and the less aggressive chickens, they fucked them up. They have a pecking order. You know, I've seen it with dogs would one dog becomes the alpha of the pack, takes over, dominates the other dogs is a natural thing. It's natural. It's natural in every single animal community and it's natural with people. But we're smart and we understand the consequences of that and you've got to give those kids a reason to not do that, you know? But there's also the problem with like if you're going to school with Lebron James, okay, like standing next to this fucking giant super athlete, you're like, shit, kinda bullshit. Genetic roll the dice that I can get. This motherfucker got all aces. He's got five aces, like seven feet tall. He weighs 300 pounds and he moves like a pant.

Speaker 4:          02:14:17       There's no, there's no basis to win. And that's. I love that analogy specifically because it's so stupid. I have a tattoo on my arm and it's just a to seven off suit. I'm a poker player, but it's. That's the analogy. It's like, take it off. Take that tattoo man. Fuck. It's such to such a bad client. No, you have no idea, dude. It's the worst and you thought about doing anything about it. I have one cover up. I have one that says Lou dog. My first one ever, boy, nobody even call me Lou dog. They just did sarcastically. After I got that nickname it introducing myself a nickname. I was 18. I was like, I need a tattoo. What can I get in my mind? Could only go to Lou dog. That is one of the juiciest thing a human being could do, is give themselves a neck tattoo on their body.

Speaker 4:          02:15:02       If you just decide. I mean, I'm not talking about like a pro wrestler mean for fighters. It's pretty commonplace, but for the average person, my friends call me Lou dog. Nobody calls told me their friend at that point. It wasn't good at defending any of this shit. Already been a good. Like everything is fat. Arms was a fat kid, so I said Lou dog and really small because I could only afford a $60 tattoo, a little petite Lou dog and then below it, it wasn't even the full thing that could connect around my arm. It was just a little bit of tribal, just like a slipper, like a two inch sliver of tribal. What? How is a kid in high school?

Speaker 6:          02:15:45       Most of the guys that were doing tattoos weren't good artists. There was a few good artists. You would find them in magazines and Shit and he'd have to travel to Connecticut to get a tattoo done. It was. It was weird. It wasn't like it is now. Like now the artists are going from art school right into tattooing and you're getting these amazing pieces. I mean it's. I've never seen tattoos like today in my life. I saw one the other day. Some guy had Michael Jordan tattooed. It looked like a leg or an arm. I couldn't tell what it was, but it's like they took a photograph and just wrapped around this guy's okay

Speaker 4:          02:16:21       leg. It's insane. Yeah. Now you go on the Internet and you can actually see all the art and just compare it and pick and choose and they're just way more artists and way more people getting tattoos are

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       so much bigger market because the gun, the guns they use. Like my buddy tattoos me a shout out, Keith Carmelo Tattoos. Shout out to Karen Mellow Keith. He's the fucking man. Great Tattoo artist kid. Now he's got a nickname. He didn't give it to himself so it's not out of long island, dude. And he's got these guns. Whatever he does. He was an expensive, like German fucking engineered gun and it just doesn't look at that. That's cool. Cool. Somebody got Tom Segura tattooed with some sort of a viking hat on. What does that have? Samurai Samurai hat. Oh right. That's an Okinawan symbol on his forehead. We get a lot of the legion of Skanks Logo Tattoo or a Samurai artists just like made a thing and he offered to give someone a deal if they like tatted it on them. Dad is hilarious. That's amazing. Look how good the microphone looks. Fuck this guy's good.

Speaker 3:          02:17:22       What's. What is this name? Jamie Lee Parker. Jamie Lee Parker. Hidden Los Angeles Tattoo. West Hills, California. Damn, that guy's good. That guy's really good. Holy Shit. See, that's what I'm talking about. Like these are real artists. Like look how good that joke or is. That's insane. Yeah. These are real artists who are really. Like when I was a kid there was a lot of guys who would just take one of those things off the wall and they'll go, oh, you want a black panther on your. I'm sticking it on your arm and pull it down, and then they would just start tracing that line. They do a shitty job of doing it. A lot of my friends got these dog shit tattoos. A lot of them was the Black Panther with the claws cutting into the skin and the clause would be red bull. So students are like stupid things like tweety bird tattoos on the wall.

Speaker 3:          02:18:07       I was like, who the fuck would ever choose that? Lot of people. My mom had like straight up jailhouse tattoo, so my mom had a money sign that was done with a ash with a needle into her hand. Get to get that paper. I understand that. It's ironic, right? We gotta do what you gotTa do to get that paper. Let everybody know there's this weird tattoos that just like own a period in time, like the barbwire tramp stamp. Even a little bit like that. Like the nineties kind of thing that you're like, oh no. Was a dude with a tramp stamp. He's got a butterfly. Tramp stamp. Thank God. Why? I don't know. And there were no. Yeah, he just got it. It's kind of funny, I guess. It's funny. Kind of funny. What is Russian prison? Prison Tattoos? Yeah. Yeah. Books about in a pretty dope.

Speaker 3:          02:18:55       Well, there's one fader million acre, his brother fair to Faye doors, brother Alex Alexander, a million acres. He's got a bunch of crazy Russian tattoos on his body and he had mob tattoos on his chest, on his, uh, right in front of his doubts and he got them both redone and switched over. He's fucking Jack now, Jack. Really? Yeah, because they were never really. Jacqueline Alexander, a million inco recent muscles picture. He just came back because that was part of their charm and those guys, he doesn't drink. Yeah, I just stretch for rate. Yeah. Yeah, and he came out, was fighting with Hep c. he's like a fucking. Just a bad, scary look. Oh yeah. He's Super Jack. That's a good picture. But there's a better picture of him, like facing head on where you go, Holy Shit. Like he's like legitimate now that's on it. Whatever. But you get the point.

Speaker 3:          02:19:48       That's what he used to look like. I used to look like a bear. He used to have like, like our got a little bit of that right here. A little bit of fat right here. He's got like a little bit of that like right there. So he's. Yeah, because that's the part of the charm of the Mammalian NGOs was that they were almost kind of like, just looked like that. Like we don't even give a fuck. We're just tough. Russians didn't care. Yeah. He got ahold of that fucking shit. Look at his left in Israel. Go back to that picture real quick. Look at those. The tattoos on his pack on his right and his left side. Like you see him there. Those, that's when they were a Russian gang tattoo and he's got a woman on his back like I know a skeleton holding a baby tattooed on his back. Have you seen his back? Is the creepy shit? Go See. Go Up. Pull up back tattoo. That'll get us back. It's fucking crazy skeleton holding a baby. Like what? Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:20:42       I just don't do only one thing. Only skittled holding babies. That's the scariest image you can think of. The holding baby, his life. This is what they want to tell the world. When you see my back, I am skeleton holding. Baby. Baby has soared to it. Now do it and up bat. It does for the baby kill skeleton and this buts of the moon in the butts in the moon and the bats fly. You mess up just in south beach describing the fucking tattoo. Then it's so evil. Mullins. What does that mean? Well, it's. I don't think it's American. I think that's a Russian words. Right? So who knows what it says? Yeah. Yeah man. That Russian language. It's a trip to look at it, man. When you see Russian type down, you like what? You guys? How long have you been doing this? How cold hungry were you, but you came up with this shit.

Speaker 3:          02:21:41       This is the Third Reich. God with us. It says it's Third Reich Shit. Oh fuck. Alexander on the Whoa. God with us as a phrase commonly used in Harold. Harold. Harold in Prussia from 17. Oh, one and later. Okay. Per pressure first. So does it has its roots in Prussia? Yeah. Okay. The German military during period spanning the German empire. Eighteen 71 to 1918. And so it was World War One and then the Third Reich 1933 to 45. So it was in the first two bikes on. It wasn't just the third, but the most important thing is that the origins are pressure. Right. And so he's very nationalistic, I'm sure. Yeah. I still couldn't be you to be luck, dude. Oh, today's Day and age, you know, we all know the swastika. It has other meetings before the Germans took over, but you can't get a swastika tattoo. Nah, but it's a good one I'm talking about is the cry of the Swedish army.

Speaker 3:          02:22:41       See it's in 16, 31. It was done. It was saying got men on Owens by sabotage during the battle of Britain field and 1631 God with us with the war cry of the Swedish, the Swedish army. It was the last time Sweden was picking wars with anybody. So this is probably like some Russian gang shit is what we were missing. Like God is with us, meaning God is with the Russian gang members and we're just jumping into conclusions because the Nazis liked it too. Yeah. And we're also like in America, like Nazis are such a symbol of evil shit. I don't know exactly in his culture in Russia where they're from, if that's like fucking, you know, Hitler is this, you know, the, the, the antichrist that we can make them out to beat the Nazis didn't get along very well. They also had their own guy.

Speaker 3:          02:23:24       They had stolen just starving people and he was responsible for one more deaths and he was responsible for their deaths. Like dabs on people. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Hitler killed a lot of Russians to everybody killed Russians. Russians get fucked up, man. That's why they're so hardy. That's why they're so dangerous as like fighters. Those are the survivors man. So when you got some cream of the crop genetics over in Russia, no bullshit in fucking in like a hundred year period. Russia, not because, you know, like America was in two world wars, but it wasn't here. It was like we went and we send our boys to go fight over there. Russia had two world wars. They're country straight up collapsed twice. They had the Bolshevik revolution and then the collapse of the Soviet Union and then they had like just genocidal dictatorship inbetween that. Yeah. There was just a bad time to be rushing.

Speaker 3:          02:24:13       Well, they've gone through a whole bunch of those in the past. When you go look at Russian history, like what the fuck? We went to the gang is con exhibit at the Reagan Library out here. And you get to see how much of Russia they captured and how much of like I didn't know that gang is Khan had the biggest empire ever. Like they literally owned all of Eurasia and he was fucking like 40 percent of the people and I mean that dude, there's some insane number of people that are genetically related to him in Asia, like insane number at that he would like, they would do this shit where they would like send like a fuck. It's been a while since I read about this. But like they would like send it, like when they were going to conquer like a village, they'd like sending a note is basically kind of like, well look, just give up all your shit right now and you'll be okay.

Speaker 3:          02:25:02       And then some of the villages would be like, no, we're not giving up all their shapes. And then they just come in. Yeah. And then they do that just to like send a fucking message. Like even people who agreed to it, they were brutal. Brutal Shit. Have you listened to Dan Carlin's wrath of the cons? I've talked about it. If you're a regular listener to this podcast, I apologize for the next couple of minutes, the greatest fucking podcast series ever. It's all about Gaviscon. I have no idea. I knew he's a bad guy, but it's like my knowledge of gang is con was similar to my current knowledge of Alexander the Great. It's like hurt. He was gay. He killed a lot of people. I don't really know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in modern Afghanistan that that area, I don't know Jack Shit about Alexander the Great and that was the same thing with gangs con and he was a bad guy.

Speaker 3:          02:25:47       Conquered a lot of people you know who owned the world for awhile, but Dan Carlin's five part series is so God damn good that you just get. You just. You just really get a really accurate sense of how insane life was back then about what these fucking people did. This one story about the corps, me and Shaw who sent an envoy to Gin China and along the way they saw in the distance what they thought was a snow covered mountain, but as they got closer they realize that it was a pile of bones. They killed everyone in the city. They killed a million people and stack them up and these people were. They had abandoned the road because the road was so overrun with bodies that had rotten decade that people are getting sick and dying because there were so many bodies had abandoned the road. That's with anything anyone cares about.

Speaker 3:          02:26:39       Today, and this goes for myself too, like anyone who's into like issues or politics. It's like you should always just keep in mind we have. It's so fucking good. Oh good. We have it so good compared to what? Everybody's happy, but that's what progress is all about. We want it so good. We want it better. We want better, we want better. We want to know no this no that, no violence, no sexism, no racism, no nothing. You want a better and better and better and better, and we're going to. Well now we got some ground. People are getting more and more excited about gaining more new ground yet, but it's like we're never going to have it be perfect. So I almost was like, why though? Because that's that. The concept of never being any sort of racism, sexism, racism or sexism or you know, somebody's always going to perceive something as being that.

Speaker 3:          02:27:20       Right? So it's gonna. It's the onus is almost on the quote unquote victims sometimes to take the step back and go like, okay, I'm not a victim right now. I'm a brown person. Dude, if I want to call it racism, I can do it every single day of my life if I really want to. Okay. And I feel like we're never going to have that because it's very addictive to be a victim. It's very addictive to feel like you were wronged in some way. And it's also very addicted to look for reasons for it that aren't really necessarily your fault, you know, doesn't necessarily revenues of a very. Like I'm helping the world that idea. And people feel like they're doing something good. You'll never convince them that no matter how ridiculous they might be, you'll never convince them with my thing. My biggest beef, and I agree with you, I agree with you too though.

Speaker 3:          02:27:57       I think there's. That's how progress happens. Like you have to keep wanting to make it better and better. My biggest problem with say like the, the like left wing activists of today is that it's like they'll just go. It's almost like they want to burn it down because it's not perfect. I just appreciate how the steps that we've come and let's go the next step, but don't burn it down because it can be a lot worse with way we hold on to ideas and beliefs. It takes several generations for real progress to occur. The problem right now is there's so much technological progress that's aiding the physical progress. The progress is taking place far faster than they can handle. It's almost like going down hill in the snow and you're like, oh Jesus. Like you're in a car, a drive, a downhill, and the smells like you kinda can hit the brakes, but are they really going to work?

Speaker 3:          02:28:39       You're ahead of yourself. You don't have full control. And I think as a human species, that's the currently the state we're at where, where people were trying to force things down people and we're trying to force change and change normally takes a long ass time to really settle in and it's happening so quick, we can't really keep up with it. Yeah, that's the old rules. So it's like, you know, we didn't have the same way to communicate. You can get an idea across the world instantly the same way. Um, so I think that people are reacting to that and they don't know how to really deal with it, you know, they don't have to know how to share an idea with somebody that might not agree the same way, but we do because you turn up yourself when you go to the supermarket, whoever's, you know, I'm standing next to online, we get along, we're cool no matter what.

Speaker 3:          02:29:18       Our backgrounds are, what we believe. We're just coexisting. Yeah, well that's like the shit I was saying before about chick flavors, other businesses, well just I'm sure there's some guy who just believes shit that I find horrifying, but I'm just like, Hey, let me get a water. Let me get a dog. It's like you don't even think about that shit, and it's like, yeah, we all, we do exist in this world. We like come together and do all this shit all the time, but then you can kind of like pretend online that you have this like we're worlds apart and I would never do business with this problem is communicating online. It's a shitty way of communicating. People shouldn't have conversations in front of each other where they look each other and you can work through stuff, podcast for real, your harvest and write about it because you have an opportunity to be wrong.

Speaker 3:          02:29:58       Find out why you're wrong, think about it, process it as opposed to editing your opinion down and going. Here it is. This is a very specific, perfect version where it's not even really what your opinion is. It's just how people are going to perceive it. It's a game you play in a word game. Yes, the word games, playing board sports in trying to when you know, and this is a real problem with people that aren't good at communicating one on one because that's really the most valuable form of communication used to people in front of each other. You're like, well I'm going to write you an email because I can't really talk to you about this. And then you get this crazy email accusing you of all sorts of shit and you know, you're reading the tone. Definitely. You could call him up. Hey Man, what the fuck is this email?

Speaker 3:          02:30:34       Like this is nonsense. Like this shit didn't happen. Then you get together and have a conversation about it. Like let's talk person to person big Jay. We just got into the thing one time. I don't know what it was and we just as we've been like fucking brothers for like, you know, a decade and a half almost, right? We're like real close friends. We've got to a thing where I just wrote him a long email so I'm going to write it in form of an email and then he's taking the tone like very wrong, so then he writes me back and email kind of shitty and now we're like in a fucking fight and the reality was it was just trying to communicate like road dates or something. It was so stupid. You're like one conversation away from getting the whole thing and just like text messages, emails, so much is left to interpretation and depending upon how you're receiving that, if you're in a good mood, I guess he's just busy.

Speaker 3:          02:31:14       No big deal. He's a good guy. He'll get back to me. Downplay. So like this motherfucker, it's always on, on, always on your terms to man call you and you don't want to talk to me. Don't talk to me. I'll be okay. I don't want to hear this bitch ass shit like people where people get angry if you're busy like oh my God, it's always on your terms. Don't know I'm busy. And while you're saying it's on their terms, so much of that has to do with like your fucking lie, like if you're in a fight with your chick and you don't have the job you want to have and you know, and then some guy doesn't return your. It's like, fuck him, man, he's doing this. But if everything's going good, you see what I was like, oh, he's probably on that back country hike.

Speaker 3:          02:31:55       But I really appreciate you getting into cell phone service. I need to work out the stuff with Michelle and she's fucking freaked me out. I'm a, it might be a bro. I hope you were there when I do that. You Bro. And you weren't people on the phone anymore either. I called. I'm a color. I have fat thumbs. I fuck it. If I text you, I'm angry. I'm going to start. I'm going to end a friendship with you because it be so frustrated with my fat thumbs, texting, shittily. I can't believe. Lewis just called me a fag. What? Texas weak. It's weak. It's just not a good. It's good. Like, Hey, here's the address. See tomorrow it's good for that kind of shit, but that's all. That's all. It's good for it. It's not good for express. I mean it's good for fun to say shitty things to each other.

Speaker 3:          02:32:33       If you know for a fact that you real good friends and yes, you're right. It's like twitter or something like that is good for like, you know, it's good for like, Hey, if you want to check out something cool, go to www.cool stuff.com, but it's not good for like, let me explain to you my take on taxation or worse, your take on a person. The thing about your take on a person, it's you, you're allowed to have. You're obviously you like to say some politician or what have you. You are absolutely related to have your opinion on them, but you're not really talking to them. Like if you really do know them, we just sit like there's always a limitation if looking at someone from afar. Right? And if you could sit down in front of someone, some politician that you agree with or disagree with, and then have a conversation with them, then you would find out who the fuck they really are.

Speaker 3:          02:33:21       Then you'd find out who the fuck you really are in respect to this argument and that makes sense. But you can't do that. There's not enough people. There's no way. There's no way that everybody who has an idea about anybody else can be with them. But we have to respect that gap. Like if you like sports guys are the worst at it, the worst when they talk about a certain player being lazy or certain fighter being a pussy. Like what in? What are you going on about? You're talking about a professional cage fighter and you're calling him a pussy. But I've read that shit all day. Read it all the time. And it's that thing where you would never say that if you were in front of them, you would never say that in front of them. I weirdly think that like as a fan, you sorta, you're buying the right to express that opinion. In a weird way though, not that they're a pussy, but like, like when people get mad at people booing at UFC events, I'm going like, I don't know, they're kind of buying that experience, you know, and I can't hate on them if

Speaker 5:          02:34:18       they want to express themselves that way. Um, you know, it's sort of sort of a thing. I mean, look, I, I got very humbled doing the podcast with Michael bisping because I was doing radio on Sirius Xm for awhile and talking about mma, like I fucking knew anything and they're starting to show bisque bake. And then I was like, oh, I don't know, Shit. I'm not even going to pretend like I know shit. And um, it's so much better at it now. I'm not trying to fit into this fucking like mold or, or whatever. But yeah, I think that from a fan's perspective, I don't really get mad at them when they start talking shit or start to like, it's kind of like, it's part of the experience, you know? Yeah. No, I mean I get it, but you shouldn't, shouldn't be disrespectful to people for no reason like that.

Speaker 5:          02:34:58       Like there's, there's a lot of guys that get into it just because it's like they feel like they're behind a wall and they could lob bombs. It's a pussy move. It's a weird. It's not, it's not healthy for me going, it's like if you go to an event and there's two guys getting in a cage, fucking fighting to start booing them just seems to me. It's like, dude, I mean, come on man, they're fucking to entertain you guys getting in there and, and putting it all on the line. Like yeah, they have a right to know I would never in a million years, but at the same time I kind of understand it. It's almost like, well they should be able to build your comedy shows to then. Yeah, but I'll tell you, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you why not? Because they're not. I don't believe that at a comedy show, if they're booing you during your set, they're completely taking out the experience for everybody else and I feel like it'll a live sporting event.

Speaker 5:          02:35:43       It's just not the same thing. They're not, they're not getting into the fighters had. I mean, maybe they are a little bit, but you know, I talked to Mike about this. He says, people booed me. They fucking love my fault. He's a different type of person that is wearing champion. He's got a different kind of mental strength. He can you. He doesn't give a fuck. I can plow through everything and that's why I became a champion. I mean, he's like one of the most mentally strong guys to ever fight in mma because he's a god that when he started out, he was good. He was very good. He won the ultimate fighter season two and was a good fighter, but willed himself in the position of being a champion and was knocked out, was stopped, was beaten, had his momentum stopped, restart it right back up again with the same or better enthusiasm every time and deep into his thirties.

Speaker 5:          02:36:28       Did it all clean. No steroids, no allegations, no bullshit. Just worked hard and was tough as fuck and won the fucking middleweight title. It's a different type of mind, dude. I know, I know. He lost two in a row, but the fact that he went out there and had a fight that I thought he was going to win until GSP called him with that left, I thought he was gonna, win the fight and then loses the GSP for the title and the biggest middleweight fight probably ever and then just goes, I want fight Kevin Gas, lemon to week Kelvin. Kelvin so cheese us, man. You. Yeah. He's such a fucking straight up ass dude logic. He's like, it was like, yeah, I already did a training camp. Why not get two paychecks? It was a rough fight though. I don't think it was a smart, smarter than. I agree with you on that. Still up that George George, St Pierre, you know, he took

Speaker 6:          02:37:16       four years off and everything like that, but he's still one of the greatest, if not the greatest of all time. And you saw that in that fight? Yeah, I don't think he was. I mean Michael cut them. He caught him with those elbows, particularly from the bottom. But you know George St Pierre is, he's a special guy. He really is a special athlete. People were really underestimating how great George St Pierre was. He's the guy who beat every person that was ever put in front of them. The losses that he had avenged. So butte, dominantly George Saint Pierre is a monster and you know, I think that everyone, including myself, you know, really didn't think he was going to be able to come back with that long of a layoff and compete the way that you set yourself. Mike was just mentally push himself for getting better and better. Michael bisping today destroys Michael Bisping a younger Michael bisping seven years ago.

Speaker 6:          02:38:01       That's crazy. He's an old man now. Maybe it's entirely possible. I mean, the fighting is such a crazy proposition that even with like elite guys, like even when someone won a fight, like if you make them fight again, would they win 100 percent of the time? But I don't think they would. Not at all. No. So there's things in weird events that can change your fortunate a fight. I said, Steve, I think if in Ghana, in Ghana could beat him a few times if they fought 10 times, he could not come out 10 times steep. A definitely doesn't win all. Ten is definitely a few that haven't gone for sure. If they have a rematch, see the thing about like what would you have to restart it with a time machine where there's no memory whatsoever by experiencing each other because you know, you get, you understand patterns.

Speaker 6:          02:38:44       That's why it's weird when you see guys fight training partners. It's like there's guys that just know each other so well that when they get in there they've already got established a pattern. One guy's always bullied. The other guy in training one guys beat the other guy up and you could see it when they actually fight. Yeah. Well actually, and the other thing, just as we're saying this, I go, yeah, George St Pierre was the greatest ever I had to make a case for. If you have to make a case, I don't think there's a stronger case for anyone. Then for George sounds crazy coming back. He, yes, he beat everyone. Whoever he ever faced, he had two losses that were Matt Hughes and Matt Serra Right and came back and destroyed them in the rematches Matt, Matt Hughes twice, and Matt Serra just came back and beat him in the third rubber match.

Speaker 6:          02:39:26       Never happened. Then after retiring, comes back and wins the championship. A division up, not just that, but Michael Bisping and chokes him unconscious with a rear naked choke. That was one of the tightest, most cinched up rear naked choke I've ever seen anybody perform ever. I mean he, he had it like a Jujitsu guy, like a lot of MMA guys. They have a harder time getting those gloves fully locked into position. Like there's a difference between there's this, there's an a rear naked choke with the palm is touching the back of the head, which a lot of people opt for because you don't have to make as much space for the arm. You can get back there, you can grab that head, but the real way to do it as like this, the real way to do it as a karate chop where you go to the back of the neck with the karate chop and once you have that in place, then there's this crazy leverage and it just

Speaker 3:          02:40:13       squeezes the fuck out of someone's neck on someone really gets one of those locked in and that's what George did. And the way he did it was like as tight and sweet and four star black belt level, rear naked choke the you ever seen the God damn it. It's hard to listen to you describe. It's a beautiful. That's another thing didn't. I never gave a shit at all the same way like me and Michael [inaudible] at this point to become friends to where it's like you start to fucking care about these guys. If you imagine being a family member, you imagine having somebody that you, like, your blood is in there. Um, you know, being a fan of somebody is one thing, but then you know somebody and that, that was, that was hard to watch. Shops, one of my best friends and I had to do commentary on some of his fights because it was a real hard time.

Speaker 3:          02:41:00       It real hard. Last couple of fights in particular was very hard for me. Very hard to to like I have to be as equally enthusiastic about him getting hit as I am about him hitting somebody and I know the guy very well. Show us their shirt mass shooting for sure. I even said like everybody knew that I was really good friends with them. It was a, you know, we had done a bunch of podcasts together, but I was also the guy who talked him into retiring because I was like, look, I know what's going on. Like you know, I've seen this with other people and I'm not friends with them and it's not my position to tell people to stop and I don't know them that well. You'd have to know someone real well to know where their head's at, you know, but that's a sport where proof see like if you're billing a basketball game, maybe.

Speaker 3:          02:41:39       I guess I guess like there's something that's so much more intense about a fight, especially like there's smart blues, like when someone does something illegal or someone does something or someone does something that's fucked up, there's smart boost, but then there's booze where guys were facing each other and they're canceling each other out like you're watching a really high level thing, what these guys are trying to solve, what do, what do I have to do to connect on this guy's fucking brainstem and knock his lights out, but the UFC is marketing toward these casual fans who are basketball fans and football fans who aren't really the people who are hardcore who appreciate the martial arts side of it. What these guys are putting into it. You think so? I think they're just marketing. I don't think they're marketing towards any specific fan. They're not marketing towards.

Speaker 3:          02:42:26       People don't understand that, but I think that's the almost the same thing because they're just trying to get a mass audience and the majority of people aren't. People who really understand. What makes you say that though? What makes you say they're trying? Like what are they doing specifically? Um, I feel like when they put together, you know, fights that don't necessarily make sense in terms of rankings when they put the interim belts on, flights were don't really need to be there. You just know it's a marketing move. Because I think a title on a poster, we'll probably sell that many tickets. Good point. It definitely juices it up. When you have an interim title, something like a marketing dude. It's going like, oh yeah, we saw this many more paper version because the title and you know the difference between the interim title or a regular title.

Speaker 3:          02:43:03       A lot of the casuals don't know the difference between Michael Bisbing or fucking doors Api. Look, I'm with your set of bar. I almost feel conflicted because I have this part me that's like a purist that's like, no, it should be just like whoever number one is versus the champion and we should never fuck around that same time. If they were just like, oh, you know what, we just set up Nick Diaz versus conor Mcgregor. I'd be like, that's the greatest thing that's ever happened and I don't care. I don't care. I don't care if Khabib's one slash 72 fights in a row. Camp Bucca I'm flying a 100 out of 100 times. I don't give a fuck where he's fighting who he's fighting. It's just fun and it's exciting, but let's get real. I think there was something really pure and what's beautiful about mma is that it's always going to kind of figure itself out.

Speaker 3:          02:43:44       It is the greatest sport because it's the greatest sport. Anything can happen any given Sunday. It's inherently built. The marketing is sort of built in already, right? So you can, you can create a pecking order, you can create rankings and I think you can kind of just say, hey, the pieces are gonna fall where they're going to fall and it's always going to be super exciting and you see what the way they handle connor or certain guys, they definitely, they threw that to the side and I think conor is a great example of it as well. Why? They don't really care. They're like, all right, fuck it, dude. Go Do may whether they had it for a little while because they were part of the promotion. Yeah. Hundreds of millions of dollars off that thing. Everybody made a fuck load of money. I mean may, whether made hundreds of millions.

Speaker 3:          02:44:21       Connor made $100, million. I don't know what the UFC made. Everybody got fucking crazy paid and then they started zoo for boxing and now there are other offering a Joshua and Joshua. You're offering 100 million. I'm crazy contract. Apparently that might people. Shit, I don't know. I haven't asked anybody if that's real, but I'm not surprised. They realize there's a lot of money and promoting fights, whether it's promoting mma. Dana has a big background in boxing. You know? His son actually just had a, an amateur boxing fight. I saw that and it's instagram. Fuck. Dana loves boxing, so I always loved it so it's not unusual that they decided to go into it, but with connor was like one of those things where you're like, yeah, that's what you're supposed to do. If may with a really wants to fight conor and college never had a professional fighting.

Speaker 3:          02:45:04       You make 100 million bucks. Let's see, let's see, let's see who buys it, but I'm just saying that the MMA purists were what's best for the sport of MMA. That's not necessarily the best move and oh, it's not bad move. It doesn't hurt it at all because first of all it shows you that in the specialties that there are people that have skills and techniques and abilities that far exceed the very best mma fighters and you saw that with conor and floyd. Floyd just fucked him up. Just fucked him up. But Connor caught them a little bit and he tagged him in the beginning and you can say that floyd wasn't going full tilt and he probably wasn't. I would say definitely wasn't. He was definitely trying to wear him out and get him tired because he knew that he relied on kinetic energy for the first round or two, but you still got clipped with a shot.

Speaker 3:          02:45:44       He did want to get clipped with. Sure. I think floyd wanted to see what connor was doing and he spent the first few rounds, like kind of taking in data and like seeing like, okay, what are you doing here? What Weird Shit are you trying? But still I was like, I did not think connor was going to do that good teaching. I thought it would be over within three or four rounds and made whether it would knock him out and he would just outclassed him in the fact that it went 10 and then even landed some shots. I was pretty impressed. Fight itself.

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       That's like, it's not bad for as a purist I'm saying it's almost like it's the way they're sort of letting connor run the show. I just Kinda feel like the UFC sort of always built this brand UFC, it's, you know, it's a coca cola of MMA and I feel like connor has basically become bigger or at the very least as big as the UFC and he doesn't do, he doesn't give a shit tweet. He tweeted out the other day, I'm the boss when he was promoting the video game, like they did a diploma with Dana White is one of the characters, but I just feel like that wasn't necessarily the best thing for mixed martial arts as a sport. I almost feel like what they were doing, which doesn't hurt at all. Yeah, maybe, maybe not. I think it made it bigger. I mean it's like, dude, what connor created was like a thing that's like really hard to.

Speaker 5:          02:46:57       Even when he, when he fought a marcus bridge as his first fight in the UFC and I remember already there was like an energy in the crowd about connor fighting. She to know who this guy was angry, like why is this such a big thing? And that every fight was just a bigger and bigger and bigger thing. And then we create this thing where like Dustin [inaudible] biggest fight ever is against conor mcgregor and Dustin had way more big fights than him, but still the big deal was that you're fighting this guy. Like he just, he would create these stages. Just that it was the results. Like you put moccasins for him and he starts dust employee in the first round he slept Josie Aldo in 13 seconds. Swayze was all real accomplishments. Why him fighting? Floyd Mayweather. It was interesting because he was so exceptional as a striker. But do you think that uh, uh, this. I, I give the UFC so much credit with building conor conor mcgregor because he wouldn't have been able to do that anywhere else. Like the UFC is such a big brand that he couldn't have been a war fighter and become a, you know, a worldwide name the way he is now, probably not in bits which is weird to bell towards a stupid name. They need to accept facts.

Speaker 5:          02:48:07       Thought about that until you just said that. I wouldn't let him make an sucks balls. The regency box say it's time for regency boxing on HBO. What is this nonsense? Why would you call a regency boxing mma? Just call it mma. MMA. That's what it is. Just like when you watch Hbo Boxing, it's on Hbo and it's boxing. Think good that the UFC is sort of built this brand around it because I think it's, but for the sport in itself, because in boxing even, you know, you don't really know the difference between any of the title or the, uh, the organizations or the titles. You don't really. I don't know. The WBC, the W. I don't know. Even fans don't really know the difference. Well, they know who the big guys are. They know Anthony. Joshua, they know as Klitschko forever. You know, everybody knows about deontay wilder now. So there's a few guy, but there's a couple of other champions that are out there. They, they're like, who? Who's this guy? The guy you've never heard of has like six belts on his championship chapters, intercontinental championships. Everybody gets belts. It's like ugly boxing titles that fucking

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       big old. The UFC nailed it with that belt belt champion belt connor had two of them. He goes with my other fucking belt. I want to be the champ champ. And he's got his arms look, man, it's, it's, there's no sport like it. There's nothing like it. Nothing is going to hurt it as long as it's as long as people are interested, like as long as people enjoy it. As much as I enjoy it, as much as I enjoy watching it so much as I enjoyed calling it, as long as that's going to be the case, there's always going to be kids coming up like this. Sean o'malley kid, that wild motherfucker kid, we saw them on instagram. It's just all him smoking weed. He's a fucking savage. She's out there just doing bong hits, kick people in the face, don't Afro. I love it. I love that guy.

Speaker 3:          02:49:48       He's an animal and that fucking kid is like, this is this new breed. There's this new guy. They love it so much and when they're doing it, they love it so much and they're so good and they're going to be better the next generation that just going to keep getting better and better and better, and that's what connor did as well as he opened up that window because everyone's going to get paid a lot more money now that there's so much. You see people talking about hundreds of millions of dollars at stake. It's like everyone's gone, Huh? Okay. That's sugar. Sean o'malley could be a fucking multimin multimillionaire and a couple of years I'm not bullshitting. That kid could be huge and that's just the CBD oil company. He's a wild man. He's a fucking wild man too. The way fights. Was He gaming? He's got one of them.

Speaker 3:          02:50:26       Gaming chairs. He's fucking hilarious, but he's good man. And He. The thing about him is he's like super creative. What does that thing down that low go to the lefthand side and scroll down to that video of him working out. What is he doing there? What is he doing here? He does a lot of weird, crazy shit like that. Yeah, like he's practicing and he does that threesixty take down to the back control like guess. I mean he might not ever do that in real life, but he might hit that all the time. So he does that high kick but leave the spin. So that spans for the guard pass. That's very confused because a lot of times guys dive straight in and guys who are good, especially the half guard wind up wrapping them up real quick, but he does a spin around it.

Speaker 3:          02:51:06       I wonder if he gave me the way he hits that. If he does that over and over and over again, I bet he can do that in a fight. Well, that's a cool thing about now it's like, can we watch it with like Anthony Pettis was at first like holy fuck moment with the, you know, the less wgc event ever. Um, the, the, the jumping kick or whatever, but you get guys that are so athletic now that and now there's so much money in the sport guys that might've went into like football or basketball. Now we're looking at MMA as an option. Whereas you kind of weren't getting that years ago. So there's super athletes. Think about that dude. How dangerous are these guys going to get? I was wondering about that like are they ever going to get too dangerous where they're gonna have to alter the rules because there's two athletic they can do it cause too much damage. They're not going to be much different than the best of the best now like a Francis and gone to or a steep meo chick or you know, the Tyron Woodley. We'll look at a guy like tyron woodley that is about as explosive as a man who can step on a scale of 170 pounds for a brief amount of time can get. Yeah. And as good as they get, the competition kind of gets better too. So yeah, Tyron Woodley people from UFC two, you'd be like, this should be illegal.

Speaker 3:          02:52:09       Versus Tyrone Woodley could fight 60 people in a row. Seen 10. Taiwan is only one 70. I mean he wouldn't be, but if they had real world 70 fighters voice was one 70. Yeah, he's bigger than toys. He's really about two five ish, but those have been having problems won't be the UFC Frye. Once you got into don fraud, Don Frye was a big fella. He's very much just landed knockout shot before don frye could also take a tremendous punch fight with Don Frye and talking Yama where they just did in front of each other and wailed on each other. Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. Football. Just landed right hand after right hand like a fucking movie. It was one of the craziest things anybody ever saw. I won't go down as a man. He's hilarious. He's got on the podcast. No, I have not. I would love to though. He was a boss and he's a great personality.

Speaker 3:          02:53:06       It. We had them calling a few times the animal. He doesn't give a fuck. He's hilarious. And he paid the price physically for that career, you know, he said some serious health consequences like real neck injuries and his body just got beat the fuck up. Like he had real neck and back problems from all those punches and take downs and net cranks and all that shit. You know, he was there the early, early, early days to now this is the one like he gets hit with a knee and they get an email and each other. It's crazy dude, but this is why we got into mma. Jesus. Fucking crazy. I mean, look at these guys. I mean, it doesn't seem real. It literally doesn't seem real that they could just stand and wail on each other and talking how his face is just a swollen mass. After this don fries caught on the forehead.

Speaker 3:          02:53:52       It was fucking crazy. But Don fry, he was one of the first guys to figure out a way to shut down. We're talking about the other day with Pat Miletich, shut down Brazilian Jujitsu. Guys like this look, look at his fucking mount. Like he was a real good wrestler and he had a very good top game and he also was a good boxer too, and just a fucking stud just to start and just tell the guy in the world either, you know, he first, when he first fought in the UFC, I believe he was only 200 pounds and he fought a guy who was like three something and fucked him up in like six seconds. He fought some big overweight guy and he cracked him with a jab and dropped him with a jab. Is just beat them down real quick. I think you'd beat everyone until he ran into Mark Coleman in the UFC and then that was just like just to client wrestler who too big, too strong.

Speaker 3:          02:54:38       Literally how many in Dave Smith became friends. We were roommates and we sort of renting UFC like that's how we got into UFC. Yeah, best stuff. Knock out videos together, smoking blunts, Bruce back days, you know. It was weird is that we got into it and like right around the time that we were getting into UFC, the ultimate fighter dropped so it was almost like we got into it at the same time that the country got into it when we got into it a few months earlier and then all of a sudden this thing no one gave a shit about was just like blowing up. I remember we got to do during season one so much that season to the fire was coming out. We were like, do it this season to ultimate fighter. This is fucking nuts. Fights on TV. Let's do it. And there wasn't a fight in the first episode of season two. We were furious, we almost broke our tv, we watch old episodes.

Speaker 3:          02:55:25       That's funny, but it was also like a perfect storm of like people getting interested in it and then having that ultimate fighter reality show back in the days where people, you know, I still watch reality shows back then, now you can't even fucking holding a gun to my head and get me to watch a reality show unless they're trying to survive in Alaska. I got like five of those saved. I love those shows like life below zero. That's my jam dude. I love that show. But out there finding salmon shit to eat and just chopping down trees, try to stay alive that, that I could maybe get into, but I will say I think there's something interesting about the post reality show world. Like we got over reality shows, but I feel like we're never the same. Like you never quite go back to like even just like in like what you do with this show versus a radio show. Like you're not starting to like Hello Ladies and gentlemen, a little shake, Hobo.

Speaker 3:          02:56:13       We don't want any of that. Now. We just want like an honest conversation. I feel like in, in, in entertainment in general, you want something that it just seems it's not as showy. It's more just like what real life would be. Yeah, that's a, that's what people want for sure. You know what I mean? And the thing about it is it's like it's led to a guy who was a reality star was the president. That's as weird as it gets. I mean that, that is a reality star president. He's not a politician, just a businessman got on a TV show, was a big time celebrity and now he won a popularity contest. So he's the runner of the country, you know, like that isn't an advertisement for just fucking motivation. I don't know what you want to say. Like he just said, I want that, or just an advertisement for how much fucking system sucks.

Speaker 3:          02:56:56       My favorite thing about Donald Trump is like, I've never. I used to have to really argue with lefties about butthead. Democracy is a flawed system, but now you just look at it. You're like, no. So how about that? Yeah. He was able to convince more fucking than your person was Christina. Now he's your leader. Awesome. If you have four people and they're all equally intelligent. Yeah, that's right. I'll get together and figure something out rationally, but when you get to a place where you can't even communicate with those people anymore because it's $300 million of you and you're scattered across a continent, but you're all supposed to be on the same team, voting over like really important issues that you probably don't even know anything about, like what you're talking about earlier about assault weapons or fracking. You'd be bringing up anything to certain people offshore drilling.

Speaker 3:          02:57:34       What? What are we doing? The other thing is that we're supposed to be for or against fracking. I have no idea. You definitely shouldn't be for it. I don't think it's. I think it's proven that it's safe long term because there's getting. They're getting into water supplies that causing earthquakes. There's a lot of real, real consequence. There's definitely a lot of problems with it. There's also definitely a lot of wealth that was created on the energy, that energy. Those are positive things and negative. The problem is everybody wants to discount the negative or the positive

Speaker 5:          02:58:02       note with you. Yes. No one agrees that it's actually a cost benefit ratio, but the thing that's like what you were saying before with like with four people, democracy works, but I think a lot of it is like, okay, so if we get into a fucking thing, like let's say we're in a car crash and one of the people in the car or a car breaks down rather, and one of the people in the cars, the mechanic, we don't sit here and go like, well, let's vote. Who gets to do this? You just go, well, you're a mechanic. The three of us are out in the fucking woods hunting elk. Me and Louis don't go like, well, I think we should do it this way because you've done this larger. You don't have all day. You're going to ruin the whole experience. Most of the time, just pure voting isn't how you get to something.

Speaker 5:          02:58:41       You defer to experts and when you just have this voting thing where it's like, well, we'll all just cast a vote. The dumb people the same as the smart people, the educated, the same as the uneducated. You end up with a fucking this competition to just say bullshit. That gets anyone up. Well, I'm going to make America great again. Well, Donald Trump and powers the worst elements of our society and you're like, this is all fucking retarded. I gotTa pee again. I can't believe this too. Should we end it or should we keep going? We're at three hours. All right. We should end it. If two of the three of us need a pill, I am so excited that we did this. We got to do this more often. When you guys going to be in la again, next time you invite us on this. Again, this is surprisingly, it worked really well with for people to step on each other. It was a lot of fun. Man, of course is available everywhere. Are you guys on Youtube as well or just on? Oh yeah, everywhere. We have our own platform called gas digital network.com.
