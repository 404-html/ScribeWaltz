Speaker 1:          00:00:06       All right gentlemen, we're live with a freshly fed uriah faber. No more dieting. No more way. Cutting. Is this his mic on?

Speaker 2:          00:00:14       There we go. Now it is. Yeah. Just pull that sucker up to you and cody motherfucking God brand finally made it. Yeah. Here. Gentlemen, what's happening? Just chilling out a nice little beach run and I jumped in the ocean. Cody kept the shoes on and all that good stuff. You still got a mouthful. Those green belly bars, don't tuck it in. Your mouth would get squirreled away. These teeth or specialty that have like pockets in your. I need to floss twice a day. This guy was making fun of me. He's like, Bro, you've been brushing your teeth 1:20 minutes, 20 minutes straight, brushing his teeth. I brushed, my teeth, came, you know, walked out and I was like, man, he's still brushing his teeth. Made me have second guessed that, brush my teeth long enough to have to do it again. I'm lazy. I got braces or anything. So I've got like all these natural little gaps. It's like I'm like a squirrel food gets stored up in there. I got to get it out. I understand. I understand.

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       How does it feel to not have to worry about. We were talking about this for the podcast, not have to worry about weight cutting anymore to be able to eat healthy. Not, not banged up anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:01:16       Man. It's been really, really nice and always kind of envisioned after even wrestling in college, like having a break and then you know, went 14 years longer fighting people. But I mean it is really nice to be able to. I mean, you go train. I trained what I want to but I don't do this stuff. I don't want to. I, I get in and do the grappling rounds and whatnot, but I just feel so much better here.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       You look healthy but you made out of retirement. Perfect. You know what I mean? Like you had a long career but you didn't get too banged up. Like you just end. You pick the right time. You went out with a win with a quality opponent, like ride off into the sunset.

Speaker 3:          00:01:52       I know man. I don't know. I was a little luck. A little bit of it just felt right though, you know what I mean? The last fight we went out to what, 5 million people on Big Fox. It was the first fight in my hometown in the new arena that's like the heart and like revived our town. You know, we had cody fight for the belt, like coming right up and, and uh, you know, it was just perfect man.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       It was time to good. Good. You know, it's nice. It's nice to see someone do it the right way and I hope other guys coming up can, can learn from you in that regard. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:02:25       what are the things I thought about was first and foremost, like I'd been rocked more than in the last two and a half years of my practice and live fights that I had in my entire career, which is, you know, a lot of different factors. Probably how many times you're rolling the dice, you know, you get hit in the head a bunch of different times. Things are loosening up a little bit. You get a little bit older. Guys are getting better. I got cody Garbrandt and the Jim and Chad Mendez is, and, and you know, Lance Palmer, these guys hit heavy so, you know, I was just like, that's one factor. And then I lost two fights in a row for the first time in my career ever, even though it was a decision to dominic and the decision to uh, what's his name, uh, and go riviera riviere Jimmy Riviera and it was like kind of lackluster losses. But nonetheless it was like, yeah, just like, you know what, I'm not going, I'm gonna, I'm gonna. Call this one and a good time.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       Smart. Very smart man. And I really do hope more guys learn and pay attention to how you did it and do it the right way because like, how do you guys feel about like, uh, you know, you seem like a lot of these guys are going over to Bella tour and I think Bella towards science, really good fighters, you know like Rory Macdonald, Lorenz Larkin and they got, I mean gay garden saucy. They got some great talent over there, but they also have guys that are, you know, late forties, fifties still banging stuff. Yeah. Freak show stuff for me. We always talk about this. I tell her, I said if I start getting fucked up and they're knocked out, like I'm going to keep fighting, like make sure that you pull me away from my leg, be the HMI that says, Hey, sits me down. Like, Hey, let's do a different career path.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       You know, if Allie say that, you know, that's one thing I always say, you know, we're fighters, we're always going to fight through it and obviously a lot of different reasons you know, financially or sometimes it's just hard to walk away. What do you do in the next chapter of your life? People don't set that up, you know? Luckily I'm fortunate I have a lot of good people around me so you know, I'll have different avenues to go and I always tell them, hey, if I start getting fucked up in their, stop me telling me it was important to understand that the kind of intensity and focus that's required to be a great fighter, you could do anything. You just apply. Just figuring out what that next thing is going to be in go out at the same way you went out your championship career.

Speaker 3:          00:04:37       Yeah. I always tell these guys, you know, we do talks before and after practice and it's like a feather in the cap mentality. Like every we've got guys in there that won't see the UFC daylight. I mean they'll never step foot in the octagon, but they get a little bit of pride. Whether it was one day it was 10 years or whatever of being a part of that team and that's something they add to their life. They take on them with the next thing. Somebody just comes in for a week. Some guys are going to be, you know, make it to the big show. Some guys are going to be world champions, some guy's going to be hall of Famers, you know, and, and that's, that's whatever your journey is, that's a proud thing. You can put a feather in the cap and move on to whatever you're doing next. But, but it's, it's a bigger picture and it's like journey's never over. It's just always changing.

Speaker 1:          00:05:23       Oh, for God, like Lance Palmer, who's a real world class guy, but he's fighting in, what do they call it now? It's not world series of fighting anymore. They have a new name for it. Right? What is it? They changed the name real pro fighters or something like that. Yeah, but the problem is nobody's watching a few. Very few people are watching, but he's a real world class professional fighter. Like you see when just engaging came over to the UFC, you realize like, Hey, this fucking kid is world class and he's been fighting in an organization that no one's watching.

Speaker 3:          00:05:49       Right. Well, I mean, the hard part about that is like you said, you got a gate and you got to Lance Palmer, they're still fighting tough ass dudes there. So

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       it's the same level of competition sometimes, sometimes even even worse when they get all the Russians over in belt or like those Russians are tough, you know, so like freelance, we just have to exit them at the right opportunity. He asked to get on a little winning streak and be at the right time in his, in his, in his contract and be able to jump out and go to the big show. But uh, it's hard because he's fighting these tough guys. Like the last guy, he lost it, he broke his hand the first round and then he's fighting a tough guy and it's like, oh, he lost in this show. He lost against a world class dude. And he's a world class fighter. So, you know, it's, it's, it's hopefully just something where he can make that transition over. How do you guys

Speaker 4:          00:06:36       feel about a win lose? Like pay days? Like one thing that bothers me about mma is that mma, if you win, you get a certain amount and if you lose, you get less. I feel like contractual. I think I feel like you should have a contractual amount that you get paid and I feel like when you're leaving it up to the judges sometimes and the judges, I mean both of you guys have been involved in least teammates getting terrible calls tall and you've seen it and you go, what in the fuck? You know, like look, even in boxing, the conor Mcgregor Floyd Mayweather fight. Two of those judges had connor only winning one round.

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       Yeah. How? They're crazy. They're crazy. I was looking around at those judges to. They're very familiar. Some of them were a mma. Make a judges also, right?

Speaker 4:          00:07:24       There's a lot of them that did that. They started with boxing and then they learned a little bit about Emma man and he came over and sort of judging mma, but there's a lot of them that literally don't know what they're judging or know very little about it. And your career could be. You mean you could, you might have 100 and 100, so $100,000 swing on someone who doesn't know Jack Shit. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:07:43       Oh, that's terrible. That's crazy. Yeah, that's crazy. I guess for me as a fighter, I look at it like it's rewarding, you know, but then the opposite scale of it, you can be on that losing call and horrible call the rep, screw Ya, but I don't know, for me it's. And they still appear like it's pure thing to do, so you got to go in there and fight for two checks is more your training. You come out with two checks you lose. It's for me, I honestly, and I always remember getting a check afterwards and especially when I first started, I was like, oh yeah, I got paid for this. Like literally, like it had nothing to do with the money at all. And then you got that check and then you're like, oh man. So if you're doing it for the right reasons, it should be. Yeah, just get your set amount. I think that is to warrant against the guys that are doing it for the wrong reasons. I think it was a good motivation at first or when they're trying to build it,

Speaker 4:          00:08:37       but now it's not. We're not building it anymore. Now it's a world class professional sport and I remember Uriah when you were fighting in the cage, right?

Speaker 2:          00:08:45       I remember the first time I saw you fight. I think you're fighting 55 to. Yeah, I had to start. I mean there was no weight class for me at that time. Yeah. Now I remember talking. I remember I was all pumped because Rogan knew who I was because he followed all the underground shit. I was super self aware of like how, how much my notoriety was and like the bigger show because I, you know, Youtube, I started looking on there and be like, I only have like 1500 people watching my shit. I can here and then kid Yamamoto has like $250,000. I'm like, fuck no. But yeah. Well I was frightened. I mean I fought Tyson. My first loss was against Tyson Griffin and cannot die casino and in the parking lot. And I hit him just like need him inside. Tripped him and the head dive into the steel pole and just gashed my head open like eight seconds into the fight and I'm just pouring down blood. I remember that they didn't have padding on the pole, well they supposed to do it, but that the crew was running out of time, so they didn't even take the time to put the padding on the bottom level. They just put the clear like fake leather on the top of it. And I'm just fucking gushing blood. I think we talked about this last time I was at her show. I think we do a man for real. That was a terrible way to pave the way.

Speaker 2:          00:10:05       Fuck that.

Speaker 5:          00:10:07       You know, like I said, a lot of guys can learn from you and I think it's good man. What's it like, you know, training in his gym and like when did you come here? You came there like three years ago for about going on four, going on four now. It's four years. I came out, I was off an injury. I had um, symptoms of Vertigo from mild concussions and I broke my hand, my pro debut, so I had like a whole year layoff and always reach out to Uriah. Lance was out there, so I knew lance, you know, wrestling, him and his brother throughout, you know, arresting careers, um, is, it always came and wanted me to come out there and finally hit favorite when I was 18 about, hey, I'm going to come out and take the gym out, see if it's good date.

Speaker 5:          00:10:46       He had to hit me back. It wasn't till like four years later I was able to make the trip out there and said out of the year off, I was like, dude, I'm not wasting any more time. I know I'm good. I want to see how good I am with some of the best in the world. I made all those killers out there. They had Tj, Chad favor, Joe, Danny. I mean we had. Chris was on, Holdsworth was on, you know, getting, you just won the ultimate fighter. That's a bad dude right there. Houses head doing uncrown champ, Bro. I'm telling you.

Speaker 2:          00:11:12       UNCROWN chat. He's doing okay. I think he's just, it made him look at things a lot different and he's like, he's like a gem in the gym. He's a coach for us. And just like everybody just soaks up, but he's got

Speaker 5:          00:11:24       and he's eager to just going to stick with coaching now. Or is he thinking about an option? How old is Chris? He's 27. Still Young. Very young. And he's been off for what, two years now? Almost longer. Uh, was that when Tj, when the bill was his last plate, they find the same card. So. And so he was dealing with some concussion issues? Yeah, a lot of guys. I mean, remember Tj grant was gonna fight, Benson Henderson for the title started getting some concussion issues. I Holdsworth would have it

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       where I'd look at him in one, one of his eyes would be all black and one would have like a little skinny.in the middle. And I'd be like, dude, what's going on? And he'd be like, but like hosers is like Weirdo, you know, master Tang always used to say, hey, you know, tj champion, uh, you know, 80 percent holdsworth champion 100 percent. He was like, he would never come to our, our, our team gatherings. He wouldn't go to the river, he would do anything. He was just all about training, like almost like a problem, you know, but that's what happened to Bj Penn, Bj Penn when the, when the Bjj world championship, the first American to do it and like you get an obsession and he was just vision, vision, vision had this obsession to be the best. He was knocking guys out on accident and practice high kicks and knees, you know, with knee pads on, like just because he was, he's good all the way around. But his Jujitsu, is that right?

Speaker 5:          00:12:48       Top. Yeah. Super good. And I remember coming out there and uh, with all those guys know, like a year, a year layoff and I'll say, man, I want to see how you know how good I am. So I went out there and mix well with good with the guys and had a fight lined up. Like I have a fight in two weeks. I went out there for a week, a favorite came in the last day that I was there and like matching me, like put me through the gauntlet with all these team Alpha male guys. Uh, it was wrestling day. So I was going with these guys and we walked off the mat and he's like, he's like staring me up and down, look at my tattoos like that. He's like, what do you want to do? I'm like, well, the fight in the UFC and be world champ. And he's like, alright.

Speaker 5:          00:13:24       And he's like, when can you come back out? I'm like, I'll be back out next week. I'm sure $100,000 guys been in there and said the same shit to him. So I was like, I'll be back out. Came out, you know, the week after we shook handshake, he said, all right man, he's like, get to five and Oh, and we'll get you get you to the UFC. And I just, every fight I was saving up. I fight. We came out there for a week that it can't knock them out. Flew back suitcase was staying at the firehouse. It was like 12 people in their twenties, Jap, you know, Japan, Canada, all over. I mean it was just, man, you have a weird setup, right? Like do you still have that block inside

Speaker 3:          00:14:00       block of houses? That's, that's how our team got built and that was like I bought a house in the, in the the time of the market where anybody can buy a house, like stated income loan and I didn't. I'm like, I'm going to buy a house pre 2008 before the crash, before the crash it was 2005 or $2,000. Yeah, four or five and I had no job, no income really. I was coaching wrestling camps and I was getting like $7,000, but you could do it. My, my Egypt one buddy was doing loans and he's like, I get you alone. I'm like, really? Is it? Yeah. Say it didn't come do this, do that work history because you're coaching now and you went to school as a teacher. It's a two year, like all these different things. I didn't know that that's the reason our whole economy crashed, but I was able to get a fuck hidden.

Speaker 3:          00:14:45       But worked with you alone? Yeah, worked for me. I never defaulted. I just moved all sorts of buddies in. I started, I mean on that house a block and that block of houses we had probably probably 45 people that went through their childhood there. Tj lived there. Uh, Justin buckles live their master tongue live there. Fabio Prado or coach lived there, like we had four or five houses at this point. We've been selling them off, so we all hopefully now the sports at a place where we can be in a nicer neighborhood. So we're all trying to get in the same neighborhood in east sac, the fabulous 40. So a nice neighborhood. That's the new. That's a new block.

Speaker 5:          00:15:22       Yeah, an interesting spot because you guys like surrounded by it's kind of country in a lot of way, you know, this is like the river. It's beautiful. I love outdoors activities. Tahoes close. Sandra. Yeah, our way. Yeah, you guys. It's a good spot. It's a good sentence.

Speaker 3:          00:15:42       Actually located spot and I mean I always say, and I think cody, like rough as cody's background was, he had a core, like a town that like rewarded him for being a champion athlete from football, from wrestling, from boxing, etc. And there's a heart to it. ThAt's why I feel like cody, such a good person in general, like when you, when you get cody, like, you know, dealing with people and individuals walking on the street, he's like a gentleman and like has, has a heart for the kid, you know, is kids that have disabilities, you know, these kinds of things that comes from that small town where there's, there's accountability, you know what I mean? It's like, you know, you're a good part of the community, you know, that's it. So I Think sacramento has a big city, big enough city, but a small enough town feel for that. Which you lose some other places.

Speaker 5:          00:16:32       Yeah, definitely have all the little mom and pop shops. We go to like a big team, alpha male fans. We have a discount. It's like almost like a friday night lights, football town, kind of like, oh, we're the fighters out of there. So we get the hookah. We get, you know, you know, It's, it's nice and everyone's super nice with us. So we moved the gym. The old gym was a downtown, so I moved it to over by the stadium in the state of the art facility. It's great. So we've got to drive through phab forties. So where I live, I drafted the five bad forties. That's who's who make it, you know, the nicest houses. So it's always nice to drive through that neighborhood. I got, I'm going to buy a house here and then go to the gym. So it's, it's nice, a nice little change up this year we've had.

Speaker 5:          00:17:10       Yeah. So you're right. Now you're prepping to fight tj to defend your title for the first time. First of all, what does it feel like to be ufc motherfucking bantamweight champion of the world? Man, it's awesome. I'll have so fast. yeah, it's awesome. You know, now it's about what you do with a belt. We were just speaking about this on our, on our run. Yeah. He started taking off when I started talking about this at fired up. I hate to run neighbor, like he's like wants to these runs. He's always after the practice to do these like shitty ass, like sprints on treadmills and like, dude, this is not fun, like wants to do this at 10 minutes, scratch, like just on. And I'm like, he's a bit of shit that people don't want to do. I'm like, I don't want to do this. I'd rather,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       I just hate writing movie was. And he was like, all right,

Speaker 5:          00:17:53       do you think that running? Like, I've had a conversation with a friend of mine about this with conor mcgregor, conor doesn't run. And he was like, I really feel like every athlete that's doing something that requires real endurance, like boxing or mma or something like that should run that. Like the act of moving your body, like forcing your body, like your legs propelling your body and constantly working your lungs builds you like the kind of lung stamina and strength that you can't get from anything else.

Speaker 3:          00:18:20       Um, so this, that's a good question and it's all different because I mean we, me and cody had a discussion and I'm like, this title fight. I'm like, cody, look dude, I know you don't like to do them. I want you to do these fucking runs. I'll get on a treadmill and do like a 10 minute or put it on 10 and run for five minutes straight and then I'll and then I'll put it on 12 is a little incline and do like 40 seconds on, 20 seconds off and I had to do it with me once. He was like, bro. He goes, look, I've always, I've done this kind of thing. I don't really like to run. It's not part of my regimen. I guarantee I'm gonna be in great shape. And he went in there and he fought dominick cruz and I mean, so you can't really argue with that, but in my opinion I think it's a great way to get yourself uncomfortable.

Speaker 3:          00:19:03       You can run easier, you can run hard to simulate the feeling where your lungs are going to blow up in, your head's going to pop in your fucking teeth hurt. like I like to be able to do that with, with running. But you can get the same thing at a hard goal in wrestling or jujitsu go if you're pushing the pace or a boxing go. If you can simulate that type of like energy and expenditure. But you're forced to do it when you're running really, really fast until you. Until you stop. There's no coasting, right? Yeah. But it's funny. I asked dan henderson, I asked dan harrison his good buddy. I'm like, when I first started fighting, you know I was trained with randy couture and dan henderson. They would come out to sacramento and do little camps and stuff and I ask a. I asked dan or dan henderson's buddy. I'm like, bro, how many days a week this dan and run and this is 2006. And he's like, dan hasn't ran and 12 years. And that motherfuckers is savage. Dude, he's a savage. He is a savage. Yeah, mike. He's a mentally toughest dude ever.

Speaker 5:          00:20:08       My uncle was all like old school trainer, so we'd like pad work, bag, work, run shadow box, you know, and, and spar. We get. When I was younger he would get us 50 rounds of work. It's like you get 50 rounds, you're ready for a fight. We'd always spar 50 rounds of boxing rounds when you're younger. 50 rounds and rounds fight before the fight. So it could be five rounds, 10 times. Is that what you mean? Yeah, throughout the four or five weekends to your fight, you know, fight every. Sometimes we live in the tri tristate area. So I would fight and I had a bunch of books I'd fight in Ohio on friday, saturday and Pennsylvania, West Virginia on sunday. So I had three fights and we can't do that anymore, but we lived in the tristate so we always had these regional books, you know, and if I, I got this book, you only have five fights, you know, this guy's, you know, has 100 so box amateur boxing was almost like am dressing.

Speaker 5:          00:20:56       they're always, you know, competing like that. But he never really forced us to run. We always spark, you know, that's when you really fight would happen. So I'm just composing that. He always told me growing up, he's like, fighting doesn't make you a better runner or running doesn't make you a better fighter, so I just always tell it to favorite. Every time he wants you to do those damn runs he's running doesn't make you a better fighter. Yeah. There's a bunch of different schools of thought on it and some people think that you have to run like long distance. Just enable your body to dig deep in those late rounds when you're getting tired that you'll have more endurance. That way

Speaker 3:          00:21:28       it doesn't hurt. That's true, but the whole thought process behind one person's theory. This is why I can't stand coaches that I think it's the only way you know what always learn. Of course you always want input from other people and you have things at work, but like even my, my, my manager back in the day, he always used to worry about Chad mendez, his training because like Chad mendez, lance palmer, those are two guys that had been training since they were five years old on a regimen, like their dads pushing them, making them go to this and making them do that and so they're. They're like little vacations they got were like the most they needed that they needed to go, go hunting or go fishing and get the break. For me, I was always. My dad, we'd. He dropped the trailer off. We'd have a, a motor home.

Speaker 3:          00:22:14       He dropped it off at a pawn. He'd go to work and we'd fish all day. Knew no one was having me wrestle or do anything. I didn't start till I was in the eighth grade, so I've always been on like a, like trying to catch up kind of deal and like a chat and lance are like, get your homework done. You train your butt off, you do a regimen and then you take your little break and then you'd take your breaks, you know, and it doesn't matter. It's just about what you, what you're processing as your method that you believe in. As long as you really believe in it. That's the most important thing. The belief system is bigger than anything else.

Speaker 5:          00:22:44       It's gotta be, there's gotta be different methods for different fighting styles too. I mean some people move around more like dominic and some people are more, more stationary and you know, rely more on power. I mean there's got gotta be different routines that would be more effect and it's kind of about finding whatever works best for you. Right. Exactly. For me, I like sprints on like a very explosive fighter, but also I have endurance. She was like, I did the vo two testing. It's actually I tested as a cross country runner. I hate running on the results, you know, so, but I'm, well I feel like I'm, I do better at spreading then long distance, but it's crazy. Like what, you have to be in shape for going, you know, to fight for the cage. Like you have to be a great wrestling conditioning, boxing conditions. Those are all different conditioning. It's like a boxer comes in and wrestles. he's toasting a minute if that. sometimes wrestlers they same thing. They go in there, their box color just to composure, you know, that's what made with herbs. I would. Connor said right after mayweather. He said shots were nothing. He didn't, you know, it was just the composure. Allen's logged

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       in. He's just so efficient to any new. The connor was going to fade because connor was relying so much on explosiveness and tense and so

Speaker 3:          00:23:53       and they didn't have enough time to prepare. I thought, I thought connor did a good job of staying nice and flow and everything. But here's, here's the truth. It's like if I were to take a pretty good high school wrestler or like a even like a really good high school wrestler and put them against an olympic gold medalist, like, like a high high level high school wrestler versus an olympic gold medalist. I mean, there's going to be a difference, but when, when the fatigue cracks a little bit, it starts happening a little bit. one guy's gonna keep composure completely and the other guy going to have a little bit of a of an opening in the other guy will be able to to to, to isolate that and I think that's what happened with the fight and I figured that would happen. I just didn't think that connor would do that well, the whole fight until it happened, you know, he was doing awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:24:43       It makes me wonder like, how would he have done if he had six months to prepare, how good would he have done if he got in good shape? I mean it might've been able to make it to the twelfth round. I think either way the more loose floyd got, the more he was going to start landing shots. He's just a far better boxer. He's especially.

Speaker 3:          00:25:01       I don't think it was. I don't think it would be. It's about getting in shape necessarily because connor had to be in amazing shape. He's already a world champion. Then he's got this big opportunity. That's what I always tell the guys also, it doesn't matter what kind of shape you're in. Being a cheap only means you can do more until you get tired. I think the better shape you're in. He would've kept doing more, do more, do more, and if he wasn't able to finish him, you know what I mean? Because floyd was lettIng him do more. I mean it wasn't letting him, he was wasn't letting him necessarily, but it was taken rounds on for sure. Letting connor blow out to manager. So it's, it's like the better shape you're in, the more you're going to output until you get tired, but if you're trying to fucking win, you're going to be, you know, you're going to be putting it out, putting it out, putting out. I think he would have been able to do more until he got tired. But the fatigue would set in.

Speaker 5:          00:25:51       Yeah, there was. We had this in our wrestling room, a board saying, I said, fatigue makes cowards of us all know. I read that. I was like, I had this. I was in the same restroom since I was five years old. All the way until, you know, sophomore year, junior year I was done wrestling, but I always read that I was like, man fatigue, you know, I was like, I don't even know if it was, but I knew what a coward was. So it was like I knew they didn't go right. So I would literally go so hard. I know how to wrestle really. I would just would go, go, go, go and just keep scrambling out of things. And that's how I always dress well. And my brother was like the same exact way. It was a grinder, old school wrestler and I had him pushing me.

Speaker 5:          00:26:26       So it was always that fatigue, fatigue makes cowards of us all. So when you get tired you're always going to get tired in the fight. Like I didn't know, I've never been to the fourth round. Been in the third one. So you know, with, with cruz had all these questions like, oh, how is it going to be as composures can they go, you know, keep that power and speed up the fifth round. Shit. I didn't know how I prepared for that and believe that's the thing, it just believing I was tired, but I was having so much fun in there. You juSt kind of pushed through that when you're tIred. And that's the thing when fatigue sets in, some people can either wilt from it or you know, propel them to like, when I get tired I feel like I biked down while I'm more iSo index. I'm tired. I know that mistakes happen when you're tired. So he has, when he's got to stay on it more to concentrate more on keeping your technique clean and making sure that you, uh, well, it's an interesting thing when you're fighting a guy like dominic crew too because he's so awkward. Like, you, you're, you're preparing for someone who moves in such a way. I mean, you're right. you knew better than anybody. You fought them several times. So he was so weird. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:27:25       he does move weird, like the second time I fought him, uh, I feel like it did a good job of, of like letting him move and then when he'd landed, hit him. And so the one thing I went back and I watched that fight and I'm like, you know, you're always looking at excuses of why, you know, why did I lose this fight or not? And I think little things count, and I talked to cody about this in his, in his fight with, uh, with don was let's make sure the eyes are on you when there's no action happening because dominic has always doing this weird. It's like peacocking, he's moving and doing these little movements and weird shit. And so when, when nothing's happening, who you're looking at, you're looking at the weirdo, you know what I'm saying this, he said yeah. So then it's like, he is weird, but it's not like, oh, it's a different kind of weird.

Speaker 5:          00:28:18       What was it like doing the ultimate fighter opposite tj, like knowing that you guys were eventually going to fight and knowing that you guys used to be teammates. Honestly, it Wasn't bad. Like for the first two, three weeks, it was fine. We were cordial, like, you know, it was what it was. And, uh, until he started going to like the media and like would say that I'm different on and off camera. I was like, dude, like tj, we were just like being cordial and cool, like getting through the weigh ins and doing that whole process. Honestly. It's, it's a lot, you know? Right. I'm still trying to train and fight, but it was opportunity. I love to do it. I love the guys a team. Um, had my coaches out there, my aliquot out in vegas. It was a good time. We had a good time with the team and we were fine until, like I said, he would go to the media and like talk shit.

Speaker 5:          00:29:06       Sal was different like about choking one when he was talking shit. And he stepped towards me. So I was like, so you're saying that. And so we cornered, I cornered him, uh, and the, and the and the, and the. Yeah. And that with no cameras like tj, I was like man, what's going on? Why are you talking shit? And the media saying that I'm different on and off camera. Like I wouldn't beat Your ass you right now. Cause there's no camera. he's like, you think that? And he's like, no, I don't think you would whoop my ass right now if I grabbed his ass up again when I throw it and slam against any like squared up with me. And I was like, all right, we're gonna throw down like cool with just me and him. We'll throw it down and that's it. No cameras around and maybe will subside some of the shit because I was getting pissed.

Speaker 5:          00:29:43       He was being with me, you know, right there. How many people were there when you guys almost fun? No, it was him. I was there and just got out the shower, the shower, have a picture of it. So if I sit there like it is tough but as just confused on. And I was like dude we're, we're cool. Cordial with each other. And then you go on in the media. That's when I started. I was like man, I was just kinda like fed up with the whole thing. But now it's like so long drawn out for the fight. I'm just like, if you take all that away, him leaving team alpha male, um, all the variables and he's breaking down against fighter verse spider. This is a fucking fight that I like, thankful for, you know what I mean? I'm finally getting to fight these opponents that are, they're worthy opponents that can go out there and show, showcase my skill against, you know, so it wasn't a horrible and being around the guy until he would go and talk, show in the media and I was just like a pod bouncing man, what is, what is going on?

Speaker 5:          00:30:34       How did you guys resolve it when you were alone in the locker room? Dude, everybody came with literally broke it up. Did that happen? Well, that happened and then he like put his fist up and I was like, all right, here we go. I was, I was just gonna throw some fire. Adam, we're going to fight like, all right, cool. He's going to fight me. And then uh, he put his hands down and he was like, look how you're acting bro. And I was like, oh, like he went from straight ready to fight and then to that. So I was like, whatever it is what it is, I'll just like do quit talking shit on the media. Like right here, you cAn say it to me. like I don't know why we don't have a con. You know, we can talk about it in a couple of times.

Speaker 5:          00:31:06       We've had off camera talks with me and him about the whole joe daddy stevenson fight. I was like, look bro, I understand you're trying to get your guy back on, but joe should not fight. He took so much damage in that fight and he's fighting in six days. I'm tWenty five years old and I would not fight in five or six days after. I just felt like that he was concussed. He was hurt and teachers like a man, like I can't tell them not to fight. I'm like, you have to tell them like you're a coach. You can't call his wife or his coach or you have to sit and do it. We can have. I don't want my teammates fighting each other, but dude, that's going to be bad. I said he's going to get knocked out and be hurt, you know, and teachers like, don't, don't get that in his head coding.

Speaker 5:          00:31:44       I'm like joe and we were doing in front of joe. I'm like, joe, look, I love your pioneer. Like you're, you're alleging that sport. You don't need to go out here and get $10,000 and for whatever it was they were getting, getting into that fight to go in there and have serious brain damage. He's fighting. Hydro hydro has I think eight knockouts, vicious knockouts. He throws his hands. I knew it was a bad matchup, you know, it was, that was an ego thing, tj. One and his whole team, because he was, he kicked your ass on the team. You know, we didn't, we didn't silently pick the best match ups or you know, it was in there trying to do what we could with those guys. You know, it was, it was, it was tough. You know, it's like teaching an old dog new tricks. It was just, it was hard. It was honestly hard. It's got to be weird coaching people in a short period oF time like that to me. You really need veterans. Right? So it was, it was. We had no, I didn't do any of my research on them, like how they did outside of the ufc career,

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       you know, I remember I'm in the ufc, I'm like, okay, you know, this guys, he can fight eddie gordon. So these massive, let's go with him. You know, how we just didn't know like how they did outside of it, you know. So I would have just assumed that like as a coach, if you get anybody and you're working with for six weeks, you would start thinking, oh, if I had six months exactly rid of this.

Speaker 2:          00:33:00       Yeah. What I noticed when I coached against don, we had a, we had three months. Oh that's right. Because you guys did. There was the crazy alive. The only life season. What was that like? How's your life? that was vegas been all these guys. They, I was, I was staying under wraps. But uh, you know, we had the whole crew out there. It was all my coaches were just the young guys coming up to try and get them exposure and everything, so I had tj and lance and you know, all the, all the guys were my coaches. They're running a muck in vegas. It was

Speaker 4:          00:33:33       various three connor season. That was when I came out. That was. I was ready to leave vegas. Like I couldn't wait to leave vegas after that. It was just.

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       Yeah, same as cody is what my coaches remember for the bigger. Yeah, it seems

Speaker 4:          00:33:46       send me that like vegas to live in vegas is kind of like living near a nuclear reactor. Like you may be able to do it for a couple days, but after awhile the radiation is going to get you one wrong decision from a whole change of life.

Speaker 2:          00:34:04       Yeah. All of a sudden you won't have seen daytime for, for a couple.

Speaker 4:          00:34:08       This also in my, my feelings on it is that your round, like maybe it's just me being sensitive, but I think you're around people that make shitty decisions allowed to around a lot of that in vegas because you're around a lot of compulsive gamblers. Just a vibe of the city, like there's great shit in the city, there's a lot of successful people, you know, dana and the fertittas and there's a lot of people that are making great money and doing well in business, but then there's a whole like underbelly to the city that's compulsive gamblers, have a ship and a bunch of other stuff, compulsive, all sorts of stuff. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:34:40       yeah, yeah. But uh, I think the. It'S funny, like you go to la, this is mostly talking about like, you know, people have that are trying to get into the entertainment industry or whatever. It's like la is like a social climate. If you take the crappy part of the social scene, it's people trying to socially climbing, oh, if you do for work, oh, what a car is kind of, what can I get out of this person and try to play the game and have success in vegas has just sold out. Like, all right, I'm going to go get a bunch of fucking money stripping this cocktail, Whatever it is. Yeah, whatever the deal is or whatever it is. So it's like la social climb, vegas sold out. Well it just doesn't seem like a vegas has a, like

Speaker 4:          00:35:28       there's a lot of transient people and there's a lot of people that are there just for the casinos. Whereas like any other city, if you live in chicago for instance, it's a town, you know, it's a real city. People been there for generation after generations, a lot of different businesses, a lot of variety to it. In vegas you got the hub which is all the casinos and then you got the surrounding areas that are just sort of feeding off of the casinos. It's weird. It's a weird gig. Weird. Great. Great for short, short times. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:35:57       The one thing I would say it was cool while you're there is, I mean sacramento's not necessarily a destination spot. So while I was living there and people knew that we were living there, I would get hit up like every couple of days with somebody that was coming to vegas. So there's always like, you get to rehash, like see all sorts of people that you, uh, you know, would like to see that are, that are popping into vegas. All of a sudden it's like damn everybody's hitting you up. Like it's like, you know, it's kinda like a little reunion place, you know, we go there all the time

Speaker 4:          00:36:27       now. As far as your new place, like what did you do differently when you guys moved to the new spot? Like how did you set it up? The old spot for a long time, right?

Speaker 3:          00:36:36       yeah. You got to check out the place. He'll love.

Speaker 4:          00:36:38       I saw it online. It looks amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:36:39       So basically we just made it bigger and better and tried to cover all the things that we do as mixed martial artists within one roof. So we have crossfit, we have yoga, we have a trx, we have, you know, conditioning classes that are, you know, mma base. We have introduction to stuff. And then we have the mma side, which is a traditional moitai are, are pros happen, work out of there. We have our own little locker room for the, for the pros and we have like, like nice finishes. There's a cafe there, there's an outdoor area, there's like, you know, bathrooms and showers and that's amazing. The other place was just, it was 8,500 square feet, which is still pretty big at the time. It was just cutting edge and it was like one shower, one toilet and it was 13 years of building the team and the place stunk.

Speaker 4:          00:37:35       That's a good recipe for staff and shower. First time I ever got staff was when I went out to team alpha male. It was right before my ufc debut. Literally like remember that two weekS to three weeks beforehand? No, I got the call like, you're going to fight in three weeks. I'm like, yeah. Did you get on antibiotics? Antibiotics? Yeah. I remember it was like, why are you taking it on? I'm like, dude, I got staff and like in my leg, like couldn't walk. It was horrible. First time I had it. And was it from not showering right after you trained or just have staff all over again?

Speaker 3:          00:38:05       Body habit, your nose and everything else. I think immune system down and then cut, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:38:13       do you guys fuck with defense soap? Yep. That's, that stuff is this shit guy. Seiko jakks is awesome. This boy, great guy. Great guy. So, and that, that product is fucking amazing. He has a bunch of different things like solve for scratches. This ointment, this tea tree oil and eucalyptus and stuff like that. Yeah. But you could stay on that stuff on a regular. you will 99 percent

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       of that shit. They getting that sleep, getting sleep and eating right. And, and, and you know, shout out. What kind of diet are you on cody? Like how do you, uh, how do you organize your nutrition? Actually spoke with aubrey a couple of weeks ago. We did like opposite and submit standpoint from onnit. You gave me a whole protocol. W wait, you know, for this camp, daytime, nighttime stuff really matter. I can eat whatever I want. I have a super high. It's hard for me honestly to gain weight. Like I'm hovering around 1:47 after workout, put so high, so high and I don't, not never been a big year. Like I never liked to be full. Like I don't like that because I don't know. So I just, I usually do some meal preps. I messed with some meal prep companies. Um, my wife's a great cook so she usually I eat a lot of salmon.

Speaker 5:          00:39:23       I love salmon or bison. Um, so I keep it at the end. George lockhart, I worked with him so he, he scraped the whole diet. Here's my card, here's the proteins and then we get to the fight week and I'm literally 12 pounds over and I start doing his diet and water loading and I don't run, I don't have to, I just do my workouts regularly. Like I would for a, you know, just to keep sharp for the week, lose the weight. I mean it's the best. I feel the greatest, you know, I used to always cut weight within, like cut a lot way and then get up and feel sluggish. Like with with george and the diet that he's given me an asa with, with the onnit products, I've for two months I had been on the honor products and I feel so much like just better, better with them like joint wise, like I had such defense.

Speaker 5:          00:40:11       I got a, like I said, abra gave me a whole thing that this krill oil pills, all that stuff, giant men official is so important for people and so many people don't take it, but it's just for joint mobility and joint health and just reduction of inflammation. Also it's fuel for your brain. It's great for building your muscles, like fish oils. Just one of the primary supplements I think people should take. My mom used to have us take spoons of that, not the pills. She would actually have fIsh oil and I have that stuff. I get it. Crossings, I get it in a jar, two tablespoons of it, but they have it. They you put like lemon flavor in it and different things, but it always tastes like shit. Shit. Tastes like shit. Not true. Not good. Yeah. So you just essentially eating healthy, you know, you don't have like any specific diet you follow?

Speaker 5:          00:41:01       No, I mean I, I stick to the, you know, the lean stuff, get sushi, salmon. I always do that. Um, we have a bunch of good little healthy spots around town too. We got a. Actually I'll send you out some juice or liquid. Ology juice. It'S fresh juice. We have two spots that are like right by the gym. They have like super healthy foods. Yeah, it's like a health bar. So you guys have almost like a whole fitness location there. It's not just a gym. Right. You know, and how many, how many members you have now? We're like 1400 members. What's the name of the

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       place again? Your ifa? Results meant fitness. That's it. Yeah. Because I know you were thinking about doing something with the ufc gym at one time, right? We have one, we have one out there, one of those 35 minutes away as well. That's in rocklin, which is about 35 minutes away and I've got a partner there who is a gym guy. He has crunch gyms and he's in tight with mastrov and the guys that ufc gym and so he Primarily runs that and there's no contact in that, in that place. You know, you can't do sparring and things like that. So. Oh really know any of the ufc gyms. So when they have like, oh, so you could strangle each other. You can't kick or punch Egypt.

Speaker 1:          00:42:15       So when they have like kickboxing classes, do they tap each other at least?

Speaker 3:          00:42:19       No. They the bag work and no drills. I mean, you're not going to learn if you don't do something. They do. They do some jobs they don't do any like, no, they don't have like one, one person hold mitts and one person hold, but he could do privates and stuff like that. IS it just like a liability thing? I would imagine. Probably worried. Yeah. Well at least they can do jujitsu and jujitsu and you learn great technIque.

Speaker 1:          00:42:43       It's a great idea too to have a gym that's based around the ufc where people were fans can go and learn that kind of stuff and get a great workout. Just see what they should have. Bob arum said today, so we have a boxIng as an enemy and it's the ufc. The ufc is the enemy of boxing. He's still a little dummy. Fuck bob. Tell me. Well you just, you just got six point 5 million pay per view buys from mayweather versus macgregor and a bus match. So you tell me how the ufc is the enemy. You silly

Speaker 3:          00:43:15       few out dude made. Made, made boxing cool again.

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       Definitely. I guarantee you it bumped up canelo alvarez and triple tops. Watch the 24 slash seven while. Yeah, me too. Boy. I don't know. I don't know. Look, nautica lufkin is a motherfucker dude, but canelo alvarez get gets better all the time. See a younger guy, you know, he looked fucking sensational against amir khan. He's looked sensational. It gets everybody except floyd floyd. JusT floyd got them to drain himself. Go all the way down to 1:50 1:52 or something and cut down that far. Yeah, he cut down way low and they just look sluggish. And floyd is the best boxer, pretty much ever that he is boxed him up game plan and stick to the game and just look beautiful.

Speaker 3:          00:43:59       Did triple g's interviews are hilarious. Like traditional, like russian, you know, it sounds like. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:44:07       Max max. I hear it for big drama show. Yeah, exactly. Of course. I think it would be a good fight for the fans. That's what I'm here for. more chose christ. Yes. My friends, mexicans love triple g fights. Like fucking julio. Cesar chavez. Man. He's a savage. He's a fucking animal. Body puncher and ripping shots.

Speaker 2:          00:44:30       Well if is going to get it, cody. Man, I think honestly canelo. I don't know, I just think, you know, a, a triple g is a beast. I think

Speaker 4:          00:44:41       you like to know. Why do you like to know on this?

Speaker 2:          00:44:44       I just like his, his, his um, his pressure is body punches, you know, is the, how he flows. He throws a lot of hooks on it. Like I'm a big hook guy. so like any, like Mike Tyson, I used to watch all my stuff hooks and canelo does too. Um, he throwS some creative stuff to die. So I did that. I started doing a move off of watching canelo. He throws like a fake hook to an upper cut. So it's like this and it goes like that because the guy who covered here and it comes right up the middle. I mean my didn't look as good as his. I didn't punch against scotty jorgensen when I find it looked like I was just winding my, my, my arm up like this. But it's like, well, but he has a bunch of little tricky, subtle things he does. I like canelo. He also his ring generalship like that's huge for me. Like I caught you can knock people out fast or have good combos, but the way that you take the octagon or the ring and stock them and then impose your will on him. His, his presence in there. He knows where he's at all the time.

Speaker 4:          00:45:44       Yeah. What's interesting to me about this fight is this is the first time that he's fought a guy who's world class that is a brutal power puncher like him who's bigger than him, who's going to come towards him, you know? Whereas he fought floyd for. It was a smaller guy, but just way craftier and slicker with the style and you know, it was an interesting fight, but ultimately it wasn't like the most exciting fight because floyd just kinda outboxed him. I think this is going to be a bang of my fight. I. Yeah, I think you're going to come towards each other and it's gonna get crazy for, for real. This is like the highest stakes fight in boxing because you have two murderers punchers in their prime. Gennady golovkin undefeated. The only person canelo last two is floyd. That was only last. Yeah. This is the only last and it's been decisions to use.

Speaker 4:          00:46:29       15 professional, young, 50. Phenomenal. Phenomenal. I mean, just such a good fight. I cannot wait for this fight all amped up. That's what I was with. Oscar tweeted about, you know, he's all about it. I as they, dude, we're still gonna. Watch you. This is why they're all fools. If, if oscar just said, this is great for boxing, this is great for everybody, then everybody would have been fine. Instead these guys create enemies. Know and say, this is a disgrace. This is a fixed five numbers. They're saying, floyd, if fixed the fight and you know, they're still saying some crazy shit. I aSked her is losing his mind. Dana dana is like, is he doing blow and cross dressing data is a savage. He's, he'll call them and they'll come outside of my picks about like some, you know, if I posted about them or something like that. He just kills people. He don't, he does not give a fuck. It's so funny. He's hilarious. That's what happens when you have a half a billion dollars. You don't give a fuck I guess. Well he didn't give a fuck in the beginning, which is why he was perfect for the ufc picture.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       He went right before he, uh, right after he did the whole deal where they sold and everything he was on like, and he was on some show. And he was just slouched over, look like a like a pile of crap, and I took a picture of it and I sent it to him. I said, bro, why don't you sit like you have $400, million dollars in the thing or at least investments of some fucking fitness shit or something. I sent him a picture just all slumped over like this. I think he's super stressed. I think he's better now. I think that time was like a crazy ass time. Could you imagine you're about to get involved in a $4,000,000,000 deal. And then how about afterwards all the shit starts falling apart. Rhonda gets murked. Connor decides to go to boxing, you know, the, the, the sports fallen off in a lot of the pay per view buys jon jones test positive again.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       Like what's up? Like so much. I mean he was on his way to being a next gigantic superstar. Right? I mean if you take away his, his time off, right? The time off where you get busted before he had to take a whole year off because of the dick pills, all this different stuff. That time off from the car accident take all the time off and john keeps winning and you got a goddamn gigantic superstar. The likes of like anybody that's ever been in the ufc, maybe even right up there with connor means you don't know. Even even. I mean all the negative stuff that's happened in John Jones, people are still booming dc and cheered him. He has some great pr going that I don't think it's that at all. I don't think it's. I don't think theY have the brain. I don't think anybody alive has the brains to organize public response.

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       I think public people tweet to pe. They love john becauSe what john is, first of all, he's a ruthless killer inside the octagon and then he's like, he fucks up, but he's still a bad motherfucker. Like he. He was getting booed and everything and then he took the time off and then by the time he came back, people were back out to the side. It's like, you know, he glued. When was he getting booed there? He's getting booed a like before he got suspended the time before. Really? Yeah. When he tested positive for coke, I can't remember. I'm getting booed and if but if he was, it was nothing like dc dc winds fights and gets booed. Crazy. You kNow what I mean? He beats rumbling. He gets booed. People get mad at them. They got mad at him when he beat rumbled. Member were blowing them like, what are you blowing?

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       The guy just fucking choked out. Rumble johnson like how we kill it for the second time. How are you doing? I don't get it, but you can't. The public. Yeah. You can't contribute fickle. Just decide. Exactly. They decide who they love and they decide who they hate to tell you what though? John's speech after he beat dc was beautiful. That was great. It was. It was great, but it was followed up by a steroid tests. That's why it's so sad. I've been looking. I'm hoping just like everybody else. There was some sort of a fuck up and then we figured out that someThing happened. Something was wrong. Well, I haven't really followed it too much. I don't really know the good. It's not good. Well, he tested positive for something that only shows up in urine tests. And so they did a urine test after the way ends.

Speaker 1:          00:50:33       He tested positive for this stuff and then they did a blood test and you know, he's his campus saying, oh, it's not in the blood test. Well they don't test for it in the blood tests. That's why they do a urine test and a blood test. It's a two different tests like d ball, like the main tee ball team, toronto ball or something like that. At some it's a weird substance that not a lot of people take. So um, um, apparently chael sonnen was talking about it that if he's taken that like, this is real old school steroid took a short acting short, short half life. Steroids

Speaker 3:          00:51:03       just me out, man. It's sad. It's sad. I, I just don't think I've been. What's, what are you proving? That's my whole thing.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       Well, he must have felt like you needed some sort of an edge. If he took it. He took it or, or the real problem is, or was he taking stuff the whole time? Did he get involved with those power lifter dudes and start taking shit because remember he's got fucking suit.

Speaker 3:          00:51:26       Her dad was just massive.

Speaker 1:          00:51:28       yeah. I mean he literally was going to heavyweight. He looks huge.

Speaker 3:          00:51:33       I mean, I don't want to speculate at all really. Yeah, I know. But uh,

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       but you were involved in the sport in the early days when there was no testing, they just look at you. Yeah, I mean when you were, when you were first finding like Kenya cage, was there any drug testing?

Speaker 3:          00:51:48       No, nothing. Not at all. There wasn't any type of anything. I mean it was illegal in California, so the, the only reason we were fighting on indian reservations because everything was illegal.

Speaker 1:          00:51:58       Isn't that crazy that native americans do whatever the fuck they want because we screwed them so bad. But it's not a way. I mean, it's happened so many generations ago. It's kind oF weird that it's still around, but they have like this sort of. They have a nation inside a nation. So it's very odd little situation

Speaker 3:          00:52:15       over in the u, s we talk about the holocaust and what happened over there and over in like Germany, they talk about what we did, the indians.

Speaker 1:          00:52:22       Well you know what we did at the indian, we were here when it comes to like genocide. You know what the biggest genocide was? Disease. Yeah. Ninety percent of them were killed by smallpox and all sorts of bugs that they just had no resistance from. That's right when they first met the europeans and it had nothing to do with like a planned attack on them. People were just dying off like crazy. That's what happened. That's right. Terrific. That's crazy. Yeah. but it's a thank god they have casinos.

Speaker 3:          00:52:51       So I've got a bUnch oF buddies that are native and so they have like different things in one tribe. Like you had things you Could, you could choose one group up in northern coast, took their fishing rights so they can fish with nets and like put bombs in the water and. But they didn't take the, the casino fucked up. they did fuck all the fish. Casino money. They they slang that smoked salmon. It's good. It is good, but it's not like the casino money.

Speaker 1:          00:53:20       You buy a lot of smoke sound foxwoods cash. Exactly. Yeah. There was um, a, a place in alberta where, uh, I've been hunting up there and the natives, they call them first nation people up there. They're allowed to basically hunt anyway. They want these spotlights and shoot animals at night. They shoot as many as they were their rights, right? Yeah. That's part of the deal. They fish casino, he got free moose have free. They're just allowed to use all sorts of, you know, what other people would think of is unethical techniques. Do you have any hunting trips coming up? Yeah. Yeah. Mom going to Utah soon. Alcon a couple of weeks. We're excited.

Speaker 3:          00:54:01       You eat mostly. I know Chad does that, but tries to eat mostly food that he's

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       killed themselves as much as I can. Ninety nine percent of the food I eat is wild game other than vegetables. Yeah. Shit. well, if you could shoot an elk, like either those ell kids that are. How back? That's 400 pounds of meat. I give a lot of it to my friends who don't hunt, you know, just like elk. But uh, that's, that's enough meat for a year and then I usually shoot a deer to a year.

Speaker 3:          00:54:27       Yeah. And that's what trips me out about people that are so against hunting. I mean, I'm not a big hunter, but uh, like the things that happened, like on the farm is where they're like, you know, have animals, is cajun and try to feed him getting fat. I mean, that's some nasty stuff and this is way more humane and a healthier way to eat. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       It's definitely healthier way to eat and it's definitely way more humane. people love to point the finger. 90 seven percent of the people in this country meet either that or they're pescatarian and they eat, but you know, that there's maybe three percent of the people in this country that are vegans and that's a, that's a small number. But you know, they, they get very vocal about it and the best way for them to like, they can find a person, like say if you hunt, you hold a picture of a deer that you shot, they found you, you're you. So the urine individually. Whereas like if you have a steak, like that steak was raised by a rancher, it's on a ranch. Who's the guy who shot at, who knows, but you got it. A supermarket. Here it is, is too many. Too many people down the line.

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       It's not. You can't point to one person. But if I see uriah faber or holding up a doc that he shot like, well that's you, you, you killed that dog. Get the vegan cat lady after you. Again. It's true. That's true. That's true. That's a true bit, man. That's the true bit. This, this bunch of. It's a community of people that think it's a good idea to feed their cat vegan food. Yeah. There's a whole move to feed cats, vegan food, and the cats can take it. They go blind and have heart attacks and shit. Yes, yes. Yeah. Cats are supposed to eat something called taurine that only exists in animal food and like in an animal protein, cats are what's called an obligate carnivore, which means they can't eat anything else. It's like a dog. Dogs can eat carrots and a bunch of other shit like dogs eat things.

Speaker 1:          00:56:17       You can eat. Dogs can eat some grains and potatoes and stuff like that. It's fine for them. They mostly eat meat, like dogs are mostly carnivores, but they can mix their diet up a little bit and still be okay. Not cats. You, you fucking start feeding cats beats and vegetables and shit like that. They bit. This chick came after you. I'll show you. I don't want to do the because it's on my next netflix special, but it's like someone got mad at me because I posted a picture of some meat on instagram. It's based on the total truth

Speaker 3:          00:56:45       store and it was one of the vegan cat ladies.

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       Yeah. Yeah. Just fucking pitch. So I don't want to ruin it for the adult, but it's just the community of people that that feed their cats vegan food, they are fucking completely there. They're like next level, crazy, like if you talk vegans are crazy. They're like, well, we're taking the shit to the next level. It's like there's levels to everything. You know, like this, like you were talking about your gym. There's guys that are just tough guys. They don't really want to fight these guys who will want to fight and the fight in the amateurs and then there's cody garbrandt. She's the cody garbrandt, have a vegan, vegan activists level of crazy. I went to his, he was a month or so ago, man, I would like to come on. It was great. That was the first guy I went live. I sat down. It was, it was great. I was laughing my ass off. Sacramento's fun, man. They came out. It was a good time. I always love performing there. Ever since. Back in the little comedy club there, the punchline, sacramento, it's great spot. It's a great little spot. I went up there. Craig robinson was in town and he's my buddy. He's a good dude and he pulled me up on stage that have me do something. Fucking shit it up the place. Pretty bad.

Speaker 1:          00:57:59       Craig bring his music up there,

Speaker 3:          00:58:01       but it saved me a little bit because he's brought me all right. I wouldn't bring my boy up, blah blah. And I got up there on stage and then, uh, and so I'm like, my manager kind of like gave me a heads up, like craig might pull you up there. So I had like, like, all right, well I just told the story that the chick that knocked on my door and came and shit all over them. I did that, but I had craig do sound effects for it. So I was like, hey man, I'll do this, but you gotta give me a sound effects. He was on her sing, like, like, then she took a massive shit and he's like, you know, doing it on the, on the key word.

Speaker 1:          00:58:33       This was like new year's, right? SoMeone broke in your house.

Speaker 3:          00:58:36       It was just a saturday night. I mean, this was on new year's. I'm more known for, uh, for this lady shitting in my head, my bed, my bedroom or my bath. And then fucking most things I've done in my life for myself. Well, you told a story somewhere. I took a video of it on snapchat and I'm like, dude, this is still open. Yeah, it's probably up. Well, tmz, tmz did it and did a story on it and they did an interview and they showed my whole thing and I actually like got a picture of the cic opened the door and there's like a canoe of shit between her legs and she's sitting in vomit and shit half in the toilet, half on the floor in my brand new house. I just spent a whole year building it, me and my dad and she just tries

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       to get in your house. What happened was the store the door, like an idiot. So. Okay. So I'm sitting there with my buddy virgil and his girlfriend. It's like 1:00 on a saturday, we're just kicking it bs and yeah, it's like a side piece you. He doesn't put that in there. No, come on. So then I hear a little knock, I thought and I'm like, someone knock on the door and then it goes away and I hear again and I'm like, I think somebody is knocking. So I go in and literally I opened the door like this and I got this plump like 24 year old fucking drunk as shit woman, like leaning against the door, like looking at me and I opened the door and she just walks in and I'm like, can I help you? And she's got a little boiler. Is that her in the background now? That's my buddy. virgil's ex girlfriend.

Speaker 6:          01:00:12       Oh dude, this is great. This is kind of strange. Just send the case walks in your house and then it goes into the bass. You walks in my house and I'm like, can I help you? Most thing I've ever seen him already. So she was passed out in shit and piss

Speaker 2:          01:00:39       your bathrooms. So. So I opened the door and she stumbles in like all chubby and, and like a boiler hanging out fucking ambulance, firetruck, swat team to come get this chick out of my toilet. And so she walks in and walks, dress, I'm not going to help you. And she just keeps on walking. I'm like, excuse me? And she like walks the end of my house and just locks herself in the bathroom. Is that her right there? Uh, yeah. Just sitting on the stoop. This is after she wiped up. Yeah. oh jesus. She didn't wipe up.

Speaker 2:          01:01:14       That's the christ itself. Jesus christ. She missed everything. It's weird that she knew exactly where that bathroom is at. I've just sat them bath. It was not there. The heroes. Had she ever been over your house for a party or something? No. So she just was in the neighborhood. So I live on a corner and there's maybe there's maybe like it comes to truth locked down. There's a bar called, uh, called uh, uh, cheaters, I think she was drunk from that walk in and had it really take a shit. There's a bar called cheaters. Yeah. Because it's kind of like the ashley madison and bars go there to hook. Yeah, of course. Of course. Yeah. I really wouldn't go there. So anyways, if you go to that bar, look like you know what's going on. Oh, it's an old ass like bar in east sac, which is like the nice little

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       neighborhood. And it's like a shitty dive bar, so I don't know what it's all about. The dude's name is cheater. It's probably cheaters bar man. About cheating and cheating. Names. Cheater. They're cheaters theaters now. Maybe it's cheaters. It's on 34th. And folsom. Is there a posture fee after the are no cheaters. Okay. Yeah, look at that. It looks angry. Fuck up. So this is right doWn the street from your house that, that, that bathroom was not there before I got the house. I added that on, poured a slab and built back and everything else. And so I don't know how the hell she, she dead ended in the end of the house and just took a left.

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       so she just got lucky. I found the bathroom shit all over the place. Did you ever contact her afterwards? Did you ever lie? No. She ever contact you and say, hey, I'm sorry. Shit all over your house. Like she's got to know that it was on tmz and all these different websites. I think she reached out. Think again, we cut that one off. Girl gets into a 12 step program. You will be one of the first people she apologized to say I gotta make it right with all the people that are wrong in the past.

Speaker 3:          01:03:27       If she's, she's someone in the neighborhood and I don't know, but the truth is like she went into that bathroom, like she was just drawn, like how could she, could she have known

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       if you know my house. That's what I'm saying. I always ask them too much. This guy,

Speaker 3:          01:03:45       mexican guy that was working for me and he had an issue. He, he would do the lacquer on all my cabinets and everything and so he took like an extra month and he would get in there and I go into the house. It was being built and he'd be passed out on the, on the floor. He'd just get high as fuck and like pass out. MY theory was maybe he, when he was, he was like, stay the night at the house, the house under construction. Maybe He was having this chubby check come over or something

Speaker 1:          01:04:13       semester I man passing off to a mexican. It's just not how you doing. Let's change the subject that's move on from the phantom shitter, like team alpha male in sacramento. You guys are like one of the real super camps in the world. Like there's like a handful of super camp says country, right? There's like a tt, you know, there's a duke roufus, there's for us, uh, hobbies, camp, tristar, aka there's a bunch of super camps. Do you try to pay attention to how other guys are running their stuff and try to figure out what, what they're incorporating as far as like strength and conditioning, you know, rehab places like physical, physical therapy, things on those lInes

Speaker 3:          01:04:54       a little bit. You know, we have a reputation for whenever we go somewhere and going into the gyms and trying to get it rolling, you know, testing yourself against other people. Like, like kind of an open door policy at our place too. Like if somebody wants to come in they can come in and check it out. So we've gotten a lot of throughout the years a lot of feedback and done her own stuff. But I'm always trying to but not necessarily like. And we kind of have our own recipe like we ever things that work out regimen and a lifestyle. it's like set set programs throughout the day and you can kind of make shift your own depending on what your coaches think you need to do and what you feel and needed to do because there's, there's, you know, two, three practices. You could hIt a day if you wanted to.

Speaker 3:          01:05:38       And then there's individual workouts and they go, you know, some guys do the cryo therapy and then they, they've been doing that suction therapy and they've been doing that. The cup stuff, cupping. I don't, I'm like, I'm like old school, like I don't really believe in. I'm not like looking for all these little secret things to do but have never done those things. Help. Something's got to help. A little like cryo helps. Do you do that at all? I've done it a couple times. You're not like, it's not a thing that I'm adamant about that I think is good, which I would've liked to do more of throughout my career is the hyperbaric chambers that after the aldo fight, right with your leg, with after the aldo fight, after the Mike Brown fight, like you broke your hand, broke my hand and had surgery. Like, I mean I would use that just as regular bit.

Speaker 3:          01:06:24       And then tj dillashaw actually got one and had it at his house in his garage brewing like in sacramento. He and he had like a certified, him and his wife got certified to do it and, and he would just like chilling that thing. Oh, so what does the hyperbaric chamber dude, it's like oxygen rich environment, right? Yeah. So it's high oxygen rich environment. So it basically like it can, like, it does like the same thing that red blood cells to do like transport things to, to your body fat and help you heal faster. So like there's high altitude which helps you get acclimated and, and, and, and make more blood cells yourself. And this is just like helping pass things through. It's like a hyper oxygenated environment. What do you, what do you feel like it did for you? It healed me faster, so that's the first that I never.

Speaker 3:          01:07:12       I never been like a big strength and conditioning guy even in, in, in wrestling, in college because I was always cutting weight so I felt like, like, you know, I've always been really strong for my size. It wasn't one of my tHings that I needed to work on necessarily. I was working on technique or working on this or fluidity or whatever. So I started. When I broke my hands, I started doing a heavy lifting regimen. I used to not like to do lifts, like squats and stuff like that because I would get so sore I couldn't do all the shit I like to do like wrestle and run and things like that. So I was going to heal my hand while I was doing these heavy workouts with my trainer. Kept asking me like, am I sore? And I was like, no, I'm not sore. We finally put it together because of the hyperbaric chamber. Like I was like hyper healing. It was like, like I would do a hard, hard workout and never get sore because I would go into the oxygen chamber. My schedule just worked out. I was going in there quick. Huh? That's interesting. Is there any downside to doing it? No, there's no. Well the downside is it's expensive and that's the same reason why insurance didn't, didn't

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       pass it to, to be insured. So like there was a session and it can be as much as 200 bucks and I a session for an hour. And how many sessions were you doing? I would get it to where I was doing, you know, like four sessions a week. Dammit. Insurance wasn't paying for this know. Ufc would pay for it. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. That's so like, is this something they have set up at the. You have the new ufc performance center?

Speaker 5:          01:08:43       I think they have a, all that stuff there and I know the underground treadmills, the high altitude a building. I've used their pet a couple of times. I'm just, we have a very fortunate with russ back in sacramento, eldorado hills that he does all that. I use hyperbaric chamber as well. I had the whole whole last year. You know what? Sometimes you kick someone wrong angles messed up for two, three days. I would go on there that day and literally you could put weight on it and move around and be fine.

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       What they use it for his brain trauma. It helps heal your brain. Like they'll play your ons and yeah, it's the same thing that they do for the bends. When somebody goes and does deep sea and they. They feel like deep sea diving, they have to put them in a hyperbaric chamber to like acclimate them to like heal them from coming up too fast. I mean there's like a real science behind it. It's no. I've heard about people using it for breaks, bone breaks and having some really quick recovery. I've just never experienced it. You should do it. I feel like why would. I would imagine it'd be just a good thing to do all the time, but I wonder if there's any negative effects. I don't think there is, I mean, you know, they're, they're, they're doing it for autistic kids, for people with lyme disease.

Speaker 1:          01:09:54       Lyme disease is a big one. She uses. that stuff's scary. Yeah. There's so many fucking people that have that and don't even know you're tired all the time and broken down. They don't understand that their immune system is devastated by ticks. Yeah. There's a thing called the rocky mountain tick, rocky mountain flee or something like that. I think it's rocky mount, but uh, there's a um. Oh no, that's not it. It's the lone star tick. There's a disease that people are getting that makes you allergic to red meat. Huh? And then getting it from ticks. That's a trip. You take a tick bite and you don't realize anything even happened and you go to eat meat, like you cheeseburger, something to get really sick. Your immune system gets devastated. There it is. The lone star tick injects alpha gal into the bloodstream and then the immune system releases immunoglobulin e antibodies to fight this foreign sugar. After this reaction, the future intake of mammal meet with the same alpha gal will result in an allergy reaction because meat has, it's like alpha go lactose. They're saying alpha gal as short. But I forget what it actually is. I forgot the actual. Uh, so does It. Does it say there? Yeah. Galactose. Alpha one. Three. Galactose. So that's the shit that lives in later. Tigers

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       shit bro. You do a podcast every day, three hours ago and learn something, but it's been around for shit. But that's fucked up, right. Chad mendez. Got that? Uh, he'd be devastated that man. Make sure you got that stuff on. You just can't see chaz vegan. Well, you can eat fish. It's mammal proteins. You start eating crocodiles. Crocodiles only. Yeah. So the hyperbaric chambers is a good one. I've been doing the, uh, the, the salt. What's the thing you've been doing? Float to do that a long time. And they finally got one right next to our, uh, uh, we own the island, a little vibe. Health bar in sacramento, the liquid and the juice fiber and they have the right next door. They have that hyper, a float center float center, so I've done that. So amazing in it. It's cool. I mean the only problem is I have to have a quiet mind enabled to go to get the most out of it.

Speaker 2:          01:12:10       Like if I'm stressing about something, I go in there. I just like. I mean I ended up like just thinking the whole time, whatever. I have to be at a right place to go in there. I think yeah, maybe it's a personality thing. Like do you. I mean I like it when I can relax, but like if I have like a lot going on my mind, I can't just shut it down and then I'm stuck in this like a lingus thinking and I can't and I'm like, I gotta get out of here and go take care of this, take care of that, but what I want, I'm able to chill. I love it. I know cody uses it a lot. I use it a lot. I one time I had a close call, like a astral projection. I don't know if it was crazy. I went in there.

Speaker 2:          01:12:46       Basically it's, I was explained to the guy that owned it at the time because I quit going. I was like, one time it happened, I feel like grim reaper came over top of me. No shit. It was like trying to push me down and drown me, but I was like sleeping and like a deep trance. Like I'd always felt like my body would vibrate and you're like kept coming. I will come back to like the wake, such an sleep deep trance. I come back up and I'd finally calm myself back down, relaxed and would drift off into the float and they bone would come like just the whole time I could feel that hot coils on my back with my face, you know, because it's still, you know, you're just above water around your head. LIke three times. I finally got up and I was like, god, I really felt like something was trying to do.

Speaker 2:          01:13:26       Someone's trying. I don't know what I was going on and anxiety or something crazy, crazy. Wow. Stop some crazy visions in their last time I was in there. I just kept the. It has the blue light in there and I got the music going and I was just spinning, lIke bouncing off this. I was just staying busy. I could chill. I'm not good at relaxing these days when he would say, I would think you'd be better at relaxing now. Now that you're retired from fighting. Oh no way man. I have to. I'll have to like if jujitsu is going on and I'm like, I'll have to like stop and be like, look guys, we're having a meeting right now. I go, let's cover this over like jujitsu started 20 minutes ago. I need to get that workout in. Otherwise I'm like, you know, you know, you create yourself a regimen throughout your life of working out a couple times

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       a day and that's what you do. And then you go in and try to have meetings all day and, and like this and put this fire out and get on this call. And it's like I was doing that together with being a full time athlete. So finding the balance has been the key for me.

Speaker 1:          01:14:26       Well for you there, there probably Is like a requirement that your body has to like blow out stage two

Speaker 3:          01:14:31       and that and that's another thing with the diet. Like he was asking about his diet, like I had been like an overeater, he doesn't like stuff stuff and he was calling me, you know, making fun of me for eating all the time. I'm like just constantly eating and whatnot because I'm used to doing that. You burn so many calories in the day. Now I have to like be mindful of not like overeating because I'm not putting out the same thing. otherwise I feel like crap. You don't want your fat tire and you're. Yeah, I mean I'm not worried about getting fat necessarily. It's more of just like feeling like, shit, this guy's coatings the best instigator ever. Whatever. I'll do it. He tries to, he tries the like accentuated like, like if he knows that I'm like man, I'm a little thick and then they'll wait like a day and they'd be like, man, fabian looking a little bigger. Just always trying to make

Speaker 1:          01:15:20       about 13 percent. Do you hAve a jujitsu match with paul? Yeah, right? Yes. That's it. And you went to a decision with him, man, that's checked six overtime. That's gigantic. That guy is fucking legit, man. He's pretty good for garlic. You didn't specialize in that and specialized in mma, you know, and coming from a wrestling background, obviously you have a grappling background and you were great at submissions in your mma career. But to take on a guy that's like, that accomplished as a grappler, that's gigantic.

Speaker 3:          01:15:50       Yeah, it was cool. I mean I always tell these guys and I actually believe it and that's what I said about connor too, like you have to in our sport, you have to be able to go with a world champion, jujitsu player, world champion wrestler, a world champion judo player, a world champion boxer and be able to hold your own, you know? And that's, that's the difference with our sport and that's why it's so impressive. And so that's what I was saying for these guys and I didn't even for that, for that. I was going to train real hard to take it real serious. But then I got this the rampage movie role with in the rocks new movie, so I went and spent 10 days in atlanta and then I had told Chad before that I would do this charity, a fishing ship with these, you know, the injured vets. And so we did that for three days and I went in there looking like a chubby. There's a picture of me. I look so freaking chubby in that, in that thing. And didn't even train, but I was like, you know, I, I go, I take a lot of pride in my grappling ability. I feel like, you know, I'm one of the best grapplers in the sport. So it was good to go in there and do that.

Speaker 1:          01:16:51       Well, you know that. And Chad beating Jeff Glover, tapping him. Yeah, that's fucking crazy. It just shows you the level of grappling that you guys have at your gym.

Speaker 3:          01:17:01       I've, I've, I've gone, like Jeff Glover and I, when I first started training, it makes more storage because I'm from santa barbara with him. And bill would. You're from santa barbara? Yeah. I was born in santa anna, beLla vista. And we have a house in santa barbara. Yeah. I love it up there. Oh bro, you got to come stay at my house. I mean we rent it out right now. Barbara. I'm renting it out. It's rented out to a family from Sweden. But. Oh, come into play. I'll hook you up dude. It's bad. You just bring your family up there. It's like santa barbara is awesome. Yeah. So there's one of the best spots really is one of the best bots. So what you're saying about Jeff Glover, you knew hIm from paragon. So jay, I've trained with jeffrey years, so the paragon used to be like the size two of these tables, like in a little room and so I would go down and walk down from my uncle's house and go down to paragon when those guys were just starting and and me and jeff who trained together for years and, and bill to bill when he.

Speaker 3:          01:17:53       Every time they build the grill, every time I come in there he'd want to go straight, straight wrestling. Like hey, can we do some take downs? Because he was trying to work on that part of his game, but like I've, I've shamed with sabrina, I've shamed with hobson, maura. I've trained with glover. Like when whenever I see somebody that they can whoop me in jujitsu, I'm going with that guy. I had hobson come stay at my house. I go and train with code green all the time. I had a glover. I'd always hit him up and go with them. So I've been going with this top level guys my whole career. That's huge though. That's shining accomplishment for you and even bigger for chat. Tap glover and it's you to see this guy, man. That's what I'm saying. I always give you shit. I've said it like two or three times when I'm like, I'm like, let's roll.

Speaker 3:          01:18:37       And you're like, yeah, you just want her to try to fucking, you know, put it on me and this and that. And I'm like, no, because you always worried about me and other people's guards. I said this the other day. I'm like, whenever I read about you and your other people, like cards, like in a fight, I'm commenting, I'm talking about your coMmentary. When have I ever been worried about you and someone's card debt? What's his name? Michael mcdonald. He's like, you're right, michael. Mcdonald's got a really good close bottom. Say that because if I'm looking at a fight, I'm looking at what? What's the possibilities here? Absolutely. I'm just fucking with you. It does have a good good team from his back when you fucked him up. He has some good. He has some good triangles. He's got. He's got good game, but it was a big win for you.

Speaker 3:          01:19:15       That was a big fight. That was a good fight. Wild. Yeah. That fight. I mean he was knocking everyone out and yeah, he's a weird one man. Like it stopped because you look at his body, you think or how is this car or heavy puncher and then he just, he hits hard fuckers. Oh, you believe it. It's a weird thing. Cody's like that. Look at him. All skinny and dopey. Hit hard. I've been given this guy shipped in the last few days because it black guy, he got a black guy, he got elva advised by somebody that was like covering up, kinda scared and then he box with my little Joseph Morales who's been with me since he's nine. He's A 25 pounder, just had his, his debut in the ufc and I'm like, man, po po got you with that black guy. And he's like, no, It was, it was an elbow. And I'm like, nah man. It was. I was getting so busy. He's like, you're going to make it real hard day for joseph next time I

Speaker 5:          01:20:09       having a bunch of people around you that fuck with you like that is actually probably good for you when you get into a situation with a guy like say dominick cruz talks a lot of shit like you're so used to it. Like that was one of the interesting things about that fight. You could tell. You're so used to shit talking. It didn't bother you at all. They get charged you up? Yeah, because he was getting fired up. Man. Dom doesn't act like that. I like the way he was acting like our times that we ran into each other. I remember about the ms dot aki fight. He was talking so much shit about me being fatherless and like crazy. I'm like, really? You could tell her you sat around and tried to research is how he's going to talk to you. I'll do that. My father was in prison or whatever it might do.

Speaker 5:          01:20:48       That's right for you. It doesn't matter. So we go through the. I'm getting ready to film to walk in the fight. Ms dot garcia at two. Oh, to catch fucking dumb at the corner of my eye. Like look and look, look away. And I was like, okay, I'm going to say something to him now. We caught up to him and he's like, what's up man? I was like, yo, what's up mami? As a you're going to talk shit on a tea. Talk shit on the media about the stupid. Even saying like, I'm going to beat it. I'm going to not be ms out faster than you did and I'll beat your ass next. And then I was like, look, I don't slam slamming on the concrete now like biz being and who, uh, daniel camaro was right there. And he's like, oh hey, like, look back.

Speaker 5:          01:21:26       And like, he's like, yeah, he's like, you do have daddy issues, like said like the off the wall shit. Like, like, sorry, no, he's not about it, but he's a great fighter, don't get me wrong. But when it's in that kind of situation he's not. I knew he was flight then you knew what the, that he wasn't about the fighter like any in his, in his interview with me. And he didn't want a bra with you. Exactly. He's, he's not a fighter. He's an athlete and he's good at. He's at what he does. But I knew that he was a different level mentality one. But that's a weird statement. Like the people I've heard people say that before. I, like he's an athlete, he's not a fighter, but if he's fighting, he's a fighter. Like, so what's the difference?

Speaker 2:          01:22:02       Yeah, I think. I think dominic actually showed like, I think he got to brave with cody. There's a couple times where he's like, all right, I'm going to get in there and show them I can hit hard and it got them in trouble in that fight. I think he's a fighter. I, I know what he's talking about with athletes that are, that are more athletes and less of a fighter. Like people say that a lot about george st pierre. Yes. Like I don't know if george st pierre loves a good nasty like knock down drag out. I know tj dillashaw like loves can't. He likes to get punched in the face and putting fuel back. Cody garbrandt will stand there and like if he gets punished, he'll marsh guys down with his face down and like tell him to hit him again. There's those kind of people that love a fucking, like a grinding fight whether he's going to do it all the time or not, but like they have an affinity for it. Like they enjoy it and then some people that are like playing a sport consider themselves tough and don't, don't like that kind of.

Speaker 5:          01:22:59       Yeah. It's interesting. Rumble said that about himself. Rumble johnson said, I'm an athlete. He goes, I'm not a fighter. I'm just really at it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       I thought it was crazy. Yeah, you chewing over there, so what's going on? You guys too. And tobacco. Can you drinking? You're spitting and just had a louis man. Oh shoot. I don't have any vices. I thought you were getting into that now. Fuck

Speaker 5:          01:23:21       that. That fight leading up with dominic was everyone thought I was, you know, the emotional one or the way that he was acting. I was like, man, this is going to be easy. Fight for me.

Speaker 2:          01:23:30       Right? Because it was out of out of not like dominic do that while you were a big threat. That's probably what it was. Right. I gave dominic cra credit because I know that dom knew that was going to be a hard fight. Yeah. Oh yeah. He said it. I said, hey bro, thanks for giving, for choosing the harder route in and talking up the fact that cody cody's the next guy because he went for the toughest fight coders until he knew that

Speaker 5:          01:23:55       yeah, he came to the fight, you know, I know he got here. He got busted, he was leaking. I mean it's, I was completely gassed and he was still fighting, like come on, you know, talking, but all the way up to that, to that point where I had kicked them and split them open and uh, he was talking shit back to me. It was funny. I was like, he's like, well, you little bitch. I didn't hurt. Like I was laughing, like, oh, don't lie, don't lie to me. I know that haven't got, you know. So it was fun. Lego was figuring them out but still like talking shit to each other and then going in and it was great because I'm like, this is the guy that I pictured fighting since I was a teenager, you know, and got prepared for him. He's, you know, you said once he hit that he stopped.

Speaker 5:          01:24:28       So exactly. Once we're. He was, every time I'd hit him or he, I hit him with a good shot or he thought he'd get me with one good. We'd go back and forth until I had kicked him and my knee hit him. And then he came back up and I saw him like, he a great poker face. Man, he's tough. He knows how to, you know, when he's hurting, he keeps it going. But his eyes, he looked at the button like I saw his pupils go really big and I was, hey don, you having fun yet? And he didn't answer back. I was a great thing like that. The third round it was, I knew that I was okay, if I just keep doing what I'm doing, I'm going to win this fight, you know, end up catching them or you know, it's my fight as long as I don't get caught with something because he throws looping punches and kicks and he's very unorthodox. But I knew right then after that he was like, oh shit,

Speaker 2:          01:25:10       this is an interesting fight coming up for you to be fucking tj after training with them for so long and all the bad blood that you guys have. Tj leaving the team and going to train with duane. Not so much about the team. There's a lot of confusion about what, what, what went down. And it's, it's fun for people because tj trained with you guys for a long time. Here's, if I send you a text, I'll say the four minute video of him explaining exactly what happened, which is know you don't have to do that, but you tell me from your point of view. So tj left the team, like said, hey look, I first off it was, it was a timed on ultimate fighter with connor with, with the company. He came from that because he was there and that's when we were defending them. That's why I'm kind of like took it to because he's like, I'm all about loyalty and like we don't do that shit. I never really liked dwayne, especially when he left because he was a guy

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       and like it was always about money and weird things, et cetera, et cetera. He left and that was fine. That was his deal. Tj was going to try to have them come back in and train at our gym for his fight. And dwayne refused to do it and I'd had a talk with teaching. He's like, it was crying and like, you know, that, that dwayne just wanting to focus on his own gym and this and that, and he's like, you know, whatever. And so he's like, I'm going to spend some time there and spend some time here, et cetera. Like that's fine. So tj, when he got there, got some exposure for muscle farm and muscle farm

Speaker 4:          01:26:37       was they help people out here. Duane ludwig's, a former kickboxing champion who was an mma fighter who fought in the ufc and then went on to be a coach for a year for a year and three of us. No, no, he coaches now a lie, right? With his own gym. But for you guys, he was your striking coach for a little bit, for a year and three months and he worked with a bunch of fighters and he had a very special relationship with tj, right. Then he moved out to denver and he moved out to denver to fight is I want to start his own thing. And then muscle farm, which has a big gym in denver. They invited tj to come train there. So to fill in the blanks when people that don't know the story that aren't maybe big time fans.

Speaker 3:          01:27:13       So then, so yeah. So then he, he basically said that he wanted to, that he wanted to, uh, he was doing his camps there for about a year and a half, but he'd spent a little time there, a little time here. Most of the time he lived in sacramento most time there we go. Work with dwayne. No problem with it. I cornered with dwayne even after he left with, uh, with you guys and stuff like that wasn't an issue. So then I heard dwayne actually text me and was like, dwayne said something like, well, I mean there's a whole side of the dwayne thing, which is hilarious. That was him getting weird like a year after he left, like acting like he was there. He tried to sue me for a figment of his imagination of some money that wasn't even there. And like this whole thing he had like his one of his students write this thing.

Speaker 3:          01:28:01       So there is something where he said that I'd like, I can't even remember, like something like I didn't give them a discretionary bonus, it was supposed to be given or something like that and so there was like some, some like intermingling is about that whatever. So dwayne texts me and says, and I said, dude, I never said I had to set the record straight on. Dwayne and dwayne texts me and says, hey, I'm not the one trying to steal your team in your fighters. I know there's a team out here in denver being built but I'm not a part of that. And I was like, are you talking about? And then, and I had talked to him and someone else said that, hey, I heard that matt brown and tj dillashaw are getting paid to be on this team. And so I come in and I was like, hey, I, we were talking about some team things and teachers and practice.

Speaker 3:          01:28:51       I go, I go, I get the weirdest thing. Dwayne texts me this and this other guy said this. I said, are you going to like, are you getting paid to go? Would be starting a new or something and it was, cody was there and lance was there and always there and tj like lies straight to us about, about the whole thing. He's like, he's like, no man. I know they offered me but I'm not, I'm not, I'm with you guys. He's like this and that. And I was like, okay, whatever. Then time goes on and we have an actual sit down and talk. We'd go eat sometimes and everything in tj, Chad mendez, uh, my buddy phil, we all go and eat and tj just tells me like, hey man, uh, my next camp I'm going to go out to denver, which he'd already been going out to denver has been like a year and a half since twin.

Speaker 3:          01:29:37       It'd be gone. It wasn't like he like gone and whatever. And he's like, but muscle farm offered me like some, some real good money to like be part of their team. He was like, so I'm basically, I'm no longer going to be representing team alpha male. I like, I'm going to do my camp out there and I'm gonna you know, they're going to announce me and we're talking about. He told me at the time it was I think 4,500 bucks a month, a month and they were going to rent them a house and I go and I was like, okay. And Chad was sitting right there and he just sit there and go. I go, well shoot man. It was nice having you on the team. And he's like, why are you getting upset? I go, I'm not upset. I'm just saying like, like, you're off the team then.

Speaker 3:          01:30:17       And he's like, well yeah, but he's like, but I, I have a house here. I'm still want to come back and like come in and spar and when I'm in town in the off season or whatever. And I'm like, for real weird to you guys for real weird. And then I said, I said, well, I said so that. So he was no longer going to be on our team who's gonna be on a different team and. But then he wanted to come in. At the time I'm ranked number three in the world, cody and him are going at it and practice. It's anybody's given day, you know, we can look at the footage if you guys have the footage, you know, but uh, and then holds verse seven and no, and, and had just won the ultimate fighter. And so tj is basically saying is leading the team.

Speaker 3:          01:30:55       I go, bro tj, I said, I said you can, you know, you're welcome to the team, but like if you're, if you're no longer on the team, like you know, what, what, what does that mean? He's like, well, I mean it's just a good opportunity man. They like, they don't have to pay. They pay me to train and, and like you know, it's, they're starting a team and everything's going to be under one roof and I go, all right, cool. That's anybody ever done that where it worked? I don't know. They're always tried that but, but here's the thing. So then after that it was like, he's like, who's going to leave in two weeks? And so me and teach me and cody are sitting in there and like we hadn't said anything. I told fabio, art instructor, uh, our jujitsu instructor, what was happening and he told someone in Brazil is the brazilian in Brazil. He leaked it out that tj was changing camps and there was all this drama and, and this and that. And then, um, I said, look, tj. So he, he was coming in and teach you is never the best teammate. He would like try to hurt people. He's a very competitive guy and he has a temper and like trying her people how

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       she shot him. She always, we always use it in the bell boxing. He nia, he's like, I just need him to the bottom. Like, yeah, we're boxing sparring easy to the body of the box. Did asked. There's no secret about tj is we talked about it when he was still on the team also that he had to be like reeled in a little bit. Right. He's just, he's just got a temper. Just want to call them killer shaw. Yeah. Killa sha dilla shank like all that kind of stuff. I mean, it was, it was, that was his thing, you know, that's just super competitive. Aggressive guy and cheap shots. Yes. Super competitiveness. Like I'm competitive. I don't want to lose. Someone takes me, you know, I'm fighting tooth and nail not to get taken down or get that extra win that round it just at the end of the bell knees.

Speaker 5:          01:32:44       You know what I mean? That's why chris is out, you know what I mean? Need him in the back of the head. I mean chris holdsworth, that's where the injuries. I mean I don't want to. Chris doesn't want us to really talk to them about that number that we're talking about. Cheap shot and that's what I mean. He doesn't care if we talk about it. I mean, I guess truth. That's what happened. What, what, how did it go? I'm not saying I remember distinctively duane used to come up with chris and be like, hey, like grasshopper. He's like, we have a. Tj is fight and he'd take it easy, take it easy on him. And chris is a killer. It's a killer. Fucking him up everybody. I mean, christmas was the animal and I guess chris choked him out and tj got out and talking to him in the back of the head when he's down in the man who was down on the mat and the spying, but it needs to the back of the head.

Speaker 5:          01:33:31       That's what. Why, I mean just dirty shit like I've been a couple times. I told chris let him up, was submitted them, let them off and then teach them in the back of my head. I don't know if that's exactly how it was. I remember seeing the whole thing. I don't really want to get into this because it's christmas gig, man. Yeah, that's fine. But we've already gotten into already got into it, but yeah. So let's talk about tj being the chief charles. That's what literally killed chris's career. No, majority of obviously concussions. Yeah. We're real good friends with chris and they live together though. They lived together. He went through and his. That's why his last fight was he had to fight with concussion because he, you know, he was scheduled to fight happens. This is why he's just like that. And you know, we've all, you know, it's one of the things that when I first came out there, I was never really close with tj.

Speaker 5:          01:34:17       I was out there, I was doing well with the guys and a couple of the guys told me like, man, tj can't wait to spar you. This is when he was coming off as rafi, I'll send cell loss. I was like, cool, like fuck it, I can't wait to spar with him either. He's better and it's going to be a good round, you know. And I was pretty worn like, hey, tj does some cheap shit. Just, you know, keep it going. And, and others video, I think I have some, uh, one of the kids that was a boxing and he sent it to me months ago. Tj, like, keep shutting me out in the bell. I was like, tell tj. I said, look, motherfucker, you cheap shot me again. We're taking the gloves off. We're going in the street and fighting. Yeah, I down because of that. Yeah. I just don't ever like that. Especially the teammates. You don't do that shit. Like, hey you, you, you get me, you get me, but don't cheap shot me at the end of the bell. And then as soon as

Speaker 3:          01:34:57       you're hitting someone after the chief, you're like, oh dude, I'm sorry, like, you know what you're doing. So anyway. So anyways, that being said, we knew that was part of tjx thing but now he's not longer part of our team and he's also getting paid to go somewhere else. He's no longer contributing in any way and he wants to come in and come in and spar our guys and like, like get. He basically wanted to be on our team benefit of our team without being a part of the team anymore and getting paid to be somewhere else, which I would have been finding it. Talk to me about like, hey, I'm going to work something out where I go get paid and do this, whatever. But then I'm like okay. So that whole week he's in there and he's sitting there watching me and cody in practice and I don't care.

Speaker 3:          01:35:39       I mean tj is a competitive. He's always looking for edge that whole week prior to telling us that he was leaving, he kept getting like, hey, there's a getting some proprietary series in this series. There's a single a guard says I used to get them with and he's like, have me and martin kampmann show him all this stuff. We were working on, hey, can you show me this? Show me that like the week before. And then so he goes, I go, tj, look man, this is getting awkward and practice. I said, look, we can. I had them over at my house and I said, look, we can build a friendship however we want to do it. I said, but this is getting awkward and like you being in practice and he no longer being on the team and everything else. Like you know, let's finish out this this last couple of days and then, you know, you'd be on your team.

Speaker 3:          01:36:21       We can be friends on, on the outside, we can work on that as a, as a deal, whatever. And he's like you. He wanted to come in and train with our team's still, you know, as not as not part of the team. Right. And then I was like, but you're welcome to stay on our team obviously if you want and continue to do your camps and whatnot. And he is just like, like out. So at that point it became him taking this opportunity, going to denver, being with dwayne, getting paid to do the muscle farm thing. And then the whole thing with connor happened on the tv show before this, before any of this happened, conor mcgregor started calling him in a coma. Snake a snake because me and connor had one conversation. We were sitting there and he goes, he goes, man, congratulations on tj defending his belt because he was still on her team is last title defense.

Speaker 3:          01:37:13       And I go, thanks. He goes, but what's up with dwayne saying that no one on your team wants to be champions. That's weird. I said, oh, he's just bitter because you know, he's trying to get everyone to go out to his camp and he's just being a hater and this and that. And he goes, he took that little bit of, of, of drama between me and dwayne, like dwayne saying that no one on our team wanted to be your champions, including cody, who sent him a text, a tweet that said, hey, keep my name out of your mouth and you're like a jealous girlfriend or whatever. And he said he took that one little thing and then next time you saw tj he goes, oh, there's a snake in the grass. And just built it in this big thing. So that means either how well he is so good at seeing people. Right. So that took like what really happened, which is tj got to go somewhere else. Me saying, all right, fine, if you're going to do that, it's cool. But like, you know, if you're on that team, you're on that team. And then then connor turned the public around on him because it came out later after the thing. And so then tiji became the victim and then he. And now tj is new stories that I, I, I got mad that he was trained with duane ludwig and I kicked him off the team.

Speaker 5:          01:38:18       Well, you know, tj now has a snake as his logo. I know on the ultimate fighter he brought in snakes, you know what I mean? He just, he's at home with it, you know, he's cool with it. So it's all good. I don't weird rewinding back a little bit like if you want to be friends, let's be friends, but don't, don't, don't lie back to it. I remember going to Canada, the whole was during the ultimate fighter sticking up for, for tj because tj was st [inaudible] basically, you know, like inviting them to fight and, and teachers. Uh, yeah, you know, like nonchalantly, whatever about it. But it wasn't defending himself. Like I'm not a, it's someone calling me a steak in the grass and say I was like this loyal to my teammates and shit. We're fighting and that's why I stick up for tj is tj is literally, I'm like we're partying in vegas, we're having a good time.

Speaker 5:          01:39:01       Like for the first time kind of a heart to heart with them. With tj. Yeah. And he's like, so he's telling me this shit. Like he said, dude, I'm with you guys. Like I'm not leaving. Fuck that. Like I'm with you guys. So I'm like, this is not even that. I'm not that close with tj, but he just powered through the champion. He's, you know, even the champion, you get taken care of and people you know, to defend them. So connor was doing that. He's like, what do you guys want to do it? It was talking about t j. So I was like, man, I'll do something bad like you're asking for a fight. We'll fight and broken to the pushing match and it was going out to the outside because that's tj saying that we were, there he is with us. I'm like, dude, you're not going to talk about my team and how does it feel now knowing that you're going to defend against tj with all this weird drama, all this bullshit for me.

Speaker 5:          01:39:44       I don't ever get wrapped up into it. It might look like that with this show, and this is my life's been like this so I can live and prosper and folks on when it's time to focus and die, it's like flipping a switch. Like I can be doing the dumbest shit like you're fighting. Dominick cruz were in the back just doing dumb shit. Like I might warm it up. I'm just. I'm just flipping. The switch was like that since a little kid like wrestling football. Just when the lights shine, I shine the brightest. I always feel like, and now a tj, I don't respect him as a person and it doesn't mean I don't respect him as a fighter. The guy skillful, he's mean as fuck and he's going to bring a fight. That's going to be what I. I love the challenge with tj.

Speaker 5:          01:40:24       It's gonna be a challenge. I know him like the back of my hand, my coaches know him, like the back of my hand. We were able to dissect dominick cruz for me, you know, through all of their experiences. This is a guy, they build it up that was there longer than I've been. You know, I went out there at to know I had 10 fights now with, with the team alpha male, now 11, now 11. Oh, world champion through the, you know, obviously I was scared before I got there. We blended together that the recipe for success, I listened to follow lead with favor and a lot of other guys on the team and so we know t jan always going to do. I know what I have to be prepared for, so I'm excited for it. Like all those drama bullshit a whatever, like it's been, it's gone on too long, like I'm just ready to focus on this fight and go in there and do what I have to do to get this winning against.

Speaker 5:          01:41:06       You have a good mindset. I mean think that is. It's a gigantic part of what makes someone successful in the sport. It's being able to do that. Like you said, having the confidence that you're going to shine the brightest when the lights are on and having this mindset like you're appreciating the fact that tj is mean and skillful hawkins is going to give you a great challenge. Yeah. It's like a couch or something like you. What do you think tj is doing? He's sitting on the couch, so you're getting up, going to do the extra work and you know, tj is a workhorse. Like that for me makes me motivated. I need these guys to keep me motivated. Like dominic, you know, he was, I watched the embeddeds of him. He was running alone, you know, like a sob story on christmas. Like I just got to do this.

Speaker 5:          01:41:41       I like it. I'm sitting there, you know, we're having a party. Enjoy this shit. Like I'm about to fight my first title. You know, I've never had this time again in my life. I'll never fight for my first world title. Now it's a fight. I'm finally getting to defend my title. Who cares? A lot of. We were talking about this, a lot of people when the title, but what the fuck do they do with it right now it's about creating that legacy. And now I have tj who's man, he's a bad motherfucker. He was ranked in the pound for pound before and the top 10. He's a killer. So that's a. I'm going to catapult my career with him and I know that I'm going to do to do with him, you know, I like said I've been with wanting to know when I was green as I was just boxing, wrestling, athletic, loved to fight.

Speaker 5:          01:42:19       Now I blended and found my own style and just finally I'm getting really um, composed in there where I can let my shirt and my skill show off it and it's, I'm fighting hire people. So like my skill level rides. I've always just liked that. Now what is this video supposedly of you knocking him out? Oh yeah, yup. Oh yeah, true. True. Yeah. How come you guys didn't release it? I don't. First off, I don't stop my video. I have seen it. It's just, it was on justin's gopro and do this. I literally that I felt bad not bad for it because it was just whatever. Tj came followed me around the gym, wherever I'd go put my gym bag way. Like, hey man, like I slipped dude. I'm like, okay. Like literally, like he was off his rocker about it. I'm like, super competitive.

Speaker 5:          01:43:05       How did it go down? What happened? I've ever had them throw in, uh, you know, doing his little footwork and then he did the jump down and does the uppercut and I just throw overhand, right? Boom. Now that I'm out and he got up and it was literally fighting easton right before the eastern flanks. I remember the date, he didn't go out cold, like flat out. He just got dropped off and came back. He came back, he was on s stanky leg, like walker and he's gonna come on. That fucker hit me. I'm like, just like, I'm like, like paul, my gi about like, he was saying that after you dropped him. Yeah. He's, he's a fucking nut. I love it. So I mean he's got a fucking now wasn't a knock out as much as it was. You just dropped him. Yeah, I dropped them to his. I mean, he, he, his legs it, I got back up and started saying, come on motherfucker.

Speaker 5:          01:43:54       So he was conscious. Right. And he knew that he was staggering bro. He looked like John Dotson had him on skates again. Is that honestly, that's what I was like, oh, okay. And he was like, I'm not going to hit him. You're fighting in two weeks out. It wasn't like that, but literally he had to say he fell forward and he slipped. I'm like, do it doesn't matter. Like I'm not going to stay anyone know? And then I was showing danny how I like steal because he likes overran rates high like throw my head off the lane and bring the right hand this and that book was, comes over and say, dude, he goes. And it was on, it was christmas day or something, sparring film. His own film was all inspiring. He's watched you knocked tj and I was like, oh yeah. I was like, oh wait.

Speaker 5:          01:44:30       He's like, oh, I have it on my gopro. I'm like, oh, that's cool. And then nothing ever came about it. And then tj was saying that he used to make me cry and practice. No, I have cried and practice for [inaudible]. This motherfucker jumped me on my head before the almay to fight. I was like super mad about it. Favorite comes in, has the camera crew, the pierce labs and like we're going hard and like don't show my head. I'm like, oh, I get mad. I'm like, well, you know, I'm like trying not to get hurt before the fight. So like I've never cried. Teetering there made me cry. So I was like, please be talking about making me cry. Like, oh man, if I cried when you get dumped on your head, did you get concussed or something? Or you get hurt more like sound like a fair.

Speaker 5:          01:45:05       He's out. He cried out saying favorite comes in and just go ma, I barely remember this. I think it was happening. First off, here's the thing, cody is a dangerous, dangerous motherfucker if you're not on your, even if he's not trying to, you get in fucking rocked or hurt or whatever. So I have to be on, on a game with him. Even if you go on light, you know, unless he's going to go light, but light doesn't work when the guys accurate and strong and everything else. So we had to go. So it was just like a, like a wizard hip heist. Lots me do that last year on my head because you were coming after me. He was like, so I know now when there's a camera crew fall in favor. It's not light. It's fucking to fight. So I love that. That's where that came from about the video and like coming out like we have the video, you can get knocked out, tj.

Speaker 5:          01:45:55       You didn't make it. He was saying he made us beat us all up like with the dominic sit down. Dwayne was maybe saying that or something. He said, oh god, you beat your teammates. And he's like, yeah, I actually for a matter of fact haven't beaten them up. I'm like, I don't fall most of this stuff. What are your. What's your thoughts on sparring? Like do you think that you should be sparring hard or do you think you should be sparring technical and pull back on shots or do you think you should have a little bit of both? I think a little bit of both. I think beginning of camp you get your, your, your, your rounds into where you're feeling comfortable and then later on I can't be your technique, you know, your, your combos that you're working kind of like flight simulation, but get those rounds in because you're not wanting to beat your body up closer to the fight. I want to feel fresh at the fight and I, that's how I've always used. I literally get 50 rounds of sparring, start tapering off towards the end of the end of the fight camp as it called unboxing. Really camp. Do try to spar with only people that you know, so you didn't know that you can trust them. So you

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       know, like especially obviously there's tj fights, a giant fight, huge fight and it's going to be huge. Not just for the division but for the sport. I mean all the major fans are going to be paying attention to this fight. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:47:00       definitely. I'm safe with it now. Like we were talking about, I have all these fights log in. Not even just all the street fights, all the boxing matches, the sparring work. I don't need to spar as much, but I need to. We were respiring 10 rounds for the cruz fight, 10 straight fives, you know, eight to 10 each week. I'm like, buckles is kinda, you know, it worked, you know what I mean? But we were doing smaller glove, more mma based, you know, big gloves. I mean me techniques thrown out the window, you know, people just sprawl and brawl kind of shit. Like I liked small glove, you know, you're still pepper in the shots hitting them, but you're working the whole gang takedowns submissions. Right. So I liked that. And also fight simulations. I like fight like having my uncle come out, pad holder, justin's the other pat order for you know. And then danny j favor have Like four different buyers rely on you as like a fight there on next. You know, you're hitting pads and you get tackled from behind. You have to work up, you know, things like that. It's safe, you're not. And that's typically what I like to do.

Speaker 3:          01:47:58       Yeah, there is, there is nothing like, you know, like, like we talked about running, sprinting, blowing out the lungs, etc. There's nothing like actual, like intense sparring to simulate what it feels like in a fight though and it's familiar as you get with it. It still feels horrible when it happens. Like I've been, I've always been known as the conditioning guy, like I can condition and and like never get tired, etc. Etc. In fights, you get tired. It's about the poker face, it's about being familiar with it. It's about like you know these things be. Yeah, being comfortable with that, being comfortable with it. So you have to get there sometimes and it's just being smart about it.

Speaker 4:          01:48:37       yeah. Cowboy doesn't spar anymore really? Yeah. Cowboys essentially does mostly drills and pad work and simulations and stuff like that and if he does sparkling, these bars super light because he was realizing that he was beating himself up too much and training and coming into fights like already kind of a little soft soft but

Speaker 5:          01:48:55       hurt them for a week and that's what he loved to do. Fucking treadmill, bike workouts and sparring pad work. Nothing really else interested with jesse. Just love sparring, doing all that. So yeah, he, he, he's sparred hard though. I mean he was jackson.

Speaker 3:          01:49:10       I heard he's a, he's like a killer knocking dudes allegation like a, like a, like a nasty

Speaker 5:          01:49:17       luck in sparring. Sparring partner probably. Maybe that's one of the reasons why I stopped doing it. Probably maybe all that stuff just. I mean, look, you can't always be the hammer if you're having those kind of a rock 'em sock, 'em robots barring sessions, you're going to get tagged for sure. Right? Absolutely. For me, I like getting in those. We just had saturday sparring with a lot of it.

Speaker 3:          01:49:38       Yeah. We had a killer's row of sparring going on this last weekend, 10 round. You've got to get those in. Sometimes

Speaker 5:          01:49:44       it's, he knows for me, like I'd been out of it for a little bit, like just knowing that it's a couple weeks, knock the rest off, you know, that's why it feels good, but you feel good about it. Like your mom, like we're going to go in here and fight and fight the tj and I bring. It's going to be. I hope it's a phone booth, you know, I hope it, you know, standard trade. Let's, let's see. I don't know how he's gonna you know, because he knows my skills and knows that I have, you know, lilly have gotten so much better since then. I was still getting the better of him and I'm not saying this to toot my own horn or whatever. It's the gym. But you're as competitive as he isn't competitive. I am. You're not going to give an edge in practice. I don't give them an edge of practice.

Speaker 5:          01:50:21       Favorite takes me down. We're going again. You know, it was vice versa. I'd take favorite down like oh it's overtime we go 40 minutes after. Sometimes it's like this guy's one of the hardest guys a break because he's just obviously too dumb to know he tired or stopped going. Like someone like we were just talking about that and now he's retired. So he comes in like these guys are like, fresh off is all fresh, but it comes in like, this guy's retired like fuck favorite man, this guy is breaking these younger dudes that are killers themselves because he just has that mentality. It's a different breed. And that's what I'm like. I said tj, he's that breed. He is at that point, you know, he's an alpha male guy. And fortunately for me, I feel like you could ever reckoned in style or do you feel like he's crossed the line into some weird sort of area? Right.

Speaker 3:          01:51:08       Did so much defending of that guy because of, you know, whatever his thing is here and this and that. And I have a lot of great friends that are newer. I mean like cody's newer in my life, but we've got a bond. I've got friends that I've had since I was like kindergarten and before kindergarten and drawing up together, you know, in my community in like I've got great groups of friends. So it's like, I mean I can reconcile whatever just stopped lying about what actually happened to save your face is like I'd never kicked the guy off of a team or anything and then he gets a one opportunity on national television to say something about me. That's my only qualm with the guy. I didn't like dwayne because of the things that he had done. But tj and I will always work

Speaker 5:          01:51:53       because work is that people making the weirdest things about running a jam and running a camp is a, you kind of have to manage, you have to be like a psychologist. Personality did. A lot of fighters are prima donnas and you do not just a trainer, not just a teammate but you also a psychologist and some sort of a counseling

Speaker 3:          01:52:13       be glue. Which and when I, I honestly, I'm just learning this more and more when I stepped out of the, the area too much. It's like, I mean I have to come back in and put out fires and bring everyone back together. And that's, I would say that's one of my skills is, is getting along with people and making things mesh and in finding a culture and building like a healthy environment and that can get tweaked so easily. It's crazy. It's cancer.

Speaker 5:          01:52:39       Yeah. And now jUstin buchholz is your main trainer now, right? He's like, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:52:43       we. Well, we've gone to now is we have, we have like a whole staff of main trainers because we have so many fires. I mean we just had sage northcutt yeah, year rodriguez and Sarah Mcmahon or in the gym right now. and, and uh, you know, rick glen is about to go and he's a new guy to the team and we've got, you know, darren elkins, so we have different guys. Like danny castillo is a head coach, chris holders, the head coach, coach joey rodriguez as a head coach. Danny castillo is a head coach. We have fabio prado who's a coach, a dustin bari, and those guys have been with us for 14 years, 13 years. And I'm, I'm in a lead position as a coach. I run, I run practices and oversee things and coordinate things. So it's a, it's a big co op and different people have different coaches that are like their main gig and you know, different

Speaker 5:          01:53:29       is still fairly young too. Right. Hold justin. So 34. Yeah, he's 35 I think. Is he completely done competing?

Speaker 3:          01:53:36       That's a great question. You never know with, with the fight game, you know what I mean? It only takes a yes to be back in the fight game. But yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:53:43       sometimes guys when they coach they also feel like they're getting better because they understand things more. You see that a lot with jujitsu competitors or at times coaching makes them a better fighter.

Speaker 3:          01:53:53       Absolutely. Yeah. I don't know if they'll, if they'll come back, but I mean what we've got is a great co op and it's always a struggle to keep things because there's going to be cliques, there's going to be the potheads and the nerds and the fucking

Speaker 5:          01:54:06       jocks and like, you know, whatever can dope. Are you enjoying it still all these years in the game?

Speaker 3:          01:54:15       Did it. You know what I, you know what it is. It was awesome. I went to Mexico city and I miss chad's wedding to go and chad's my boy. I love chatting, love abby, his wife, and it was, I know I miss a great time, but I got to go corner. Joseph miralis, who's been with me since he isn't, he's the oldest member of our team. Wow. He's been with us the longest and he's, he's nine years old when he started with us, that's crazy. And he, you know, like danny castillo is, it was me and danny castillo and our coach joey in his corner and danny was getting all teared up like we all got teared up right before the fight, like we brought it in and everyone's kinda crying and everything. And like joseph, I mean, he's been through his struggles. I went when he was going through a hard time, I took him to the front row of a, you know, the ufc and, and just, you know, putting right there and let them visualize. and so that's, that's the stuff I enjoy

Speaker 5:          01:55:06       now. Uh, you guys had your ear and camp? Huh? What else? What a crazy animal house right now. He's all by himself and big old house. What a crazy style. That guy's couch, dude, he's telling is a really talented guy. Weird style to ryan like that. Taekwondo based. Yeah. Kicking and wild shit. Like when he hit bj penn with a threesixty roundhouse kick to the face. Like go. Okay. Yeah, he's crazy. it's crazy. Yeah. That's a good range. Even said that he's hands, you know, I'm not so good with the range and like knowing like my kicks, I'm real accurate with his kicks and he says I kick harder and stuff. I think that he feels like he's more accurate with this ass kicks

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       and he is with his hands

Speaker 4:          01:55:46       quinces if he's not doing it with someone who's also a great kicker, you know, because he's able to operate in a range where he's pretty effective and most people aren't.

Speaker 3:          01:55:54       Yeah. So he's a long kIcker too. Has been staying. He's been staying at my house the last like week and it's, I'm getting to know him a lot. I mean, what a cool dude. I mean that guy is very smart, very smart. Is like well put together. He's, I got to hear a little bit about like the townies from chihuahua in Mexico and like it's a pretty, pretty scary place and in kind of his journey as a, as a young kid is one of the top karate guys in Mexico, so he's been a competItor for a long time. Used to have a coach that used to like hit him with a stick. So they left that place and the guy called him back and was like, can you please come back and I won't hit you with it? Yeah. What he was like seven and eight. Well, jesus christ, he's been, uh, he's been in a combat sport

Speaker 4:          01:56:36       for awhile. Yeah, I think that frankie edgar fight was a very tough fight for him, but a good fight as far as a learning experience and a lot of people had said that. And I was one of the ones that said it, like we'll see what happens when he fights a great wrestler. Right. That's going to be the real issue with him because he's got all this wild kicking stuff, but that stuff doesn't work if somebody grabs a hold of you. Right. And if somebody. Frank frank. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:56:59       Frank at a different level of guys. He's a great mixing it together. So yeah, a year hIs wrestling because I got to wrestle in the other. He actually post a little video of us wrestling, but his wrestling is good. It's just like connor connor's wrestling or boxing is really good. It's just not floyd mayweather. Good. Right in the later rounds, you know, so like, yeah, years made a lot of gains he wouldn't share with izzy, izzy, Israel martinez who put him through like uh, you know, he's a great coach. Israel. Very good. And he uh, he put them through a, like a whole year of wrestling. So his wrestling is top notch, but it's not, you know, it needs to get to another break, jaeger level when you're a little bit fatigued and you make a small mistake and the guy can capitalize, but it's getting there. No.

Speaker 4:          01:57:48       Yeah, It's uh, it's interesting. You see so many different approaches and his approach is very unique and it's one of the things that's exciting about him is that he's got that crazy wild kicking style. Yeah. Throw everything. Yeah. A torpedo kicks all kinds of shit. Yeah. that's the guy I to mix up with because you don't see too many of those guys, but once you run into him, right? Yeah. You better get it right.

Speaker 3:          01:58:09       Fine. It's good to watch him and feeling we're trying, you know, he, he got a win over feely, but like he felt like, ah man, I was in that fight. He just got caught. He got popped in the orbital and then got like couldn't see and get switch kick to the dome. And so fuel is like, man, it's fun to watch these guys come full circle, like, like b be feeling now they're chaining together in, in working together a little bit. And then darren elkins lost to Chad and darren elkins came to see us and and he's been on like a six by eight win streak. That guy's frigging jam

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       dude on

Speaker 4:          01:58:43       back to it because one of the craziest moments have ever seen the guy getting his ass kicked for every fucking second of the first couple rounds and they finally gets a hold of them, damn. Beats them down and chaos and then just screams like all like a demon covered in blood.

Speaker 2:          01:58:59       I was sitting there, I left during the second round. I was like, man, I can't watch this. Like I don't like watch my friends. Then. Especially when it's shit like that happens. I'm like, I walked out, the next thing you know, the place goes nuts and I see elkins knocked him out. I was like, cool. I like it. That kid, you got to honestly stop elkins. You have to knock them off. Yeah, for sure. I mean, tough elkins is the, the like the pillar of consistency. He's always in the. He's always at every practice listens to every coach. He'd going hard. We have these two and brothers that come in there. They're from chechnya. They're really talented guys. I'm actually going to go corner to the guys over in Ukraine, but uh, there are super skilled fighters but don't have that drive and like we have here and so they keep popping him, boom, boom, boom.

Speaker 2:          01:59:49       And then d and then they keep tryIng to call time out and they catch him with a couple of things in elkins chased now they go, oh you are, you're not taking the time. l oh, grabs the guy. Why did they try to take time? Because they get tired of that shit. Don't be pop, pop. Just flap his head. I'll fly back, boom. Hit them there and kick him in the leg. And he's lIke, he's like, he got, catches him with something and like grabs like time, timeouts that man. He's like, oh fuck that motherfucker no time now because it's a grinder

Speaker 4:          02:00:22       great against dennis bermudez. That's a big win, a big win and he looks smooth and that's fine. He didn't take as much damage, the names of damage for a reason because he gets somebody to also like the way his. He's moving looks better ways. Kicking and punching his combinations. He looks like he's got less extra steps. It's like this all smoothness and his transitions in his movement.

Speaker 2:          02:00:43       That's what I've been working on in. Go ahead and I think a lot of that has to do with obviously working the footwork, like these guys, some of these guys that are straight wrestlers and then like, all right, we're going to wrestle and throw punches and try to take you down. But your footwork is the core of everything. Yeah, you can have throw good hands, but if your feet are out of position or getting taken down, you know you're. You're not gonna land power punches. So the footwork, I, I religiously work on footwork daily. Like this will work. That's dominant.

Speaker 4:          02:01:10       I mean that is his entire thing is his ability to move. It's just so unusual as footwork. So we're. That's one of the things where you went toe for toe for toe to toe with them when you're, your footwork was equally as good as his is not better and you were landing harder. Combination

Speaker 2:          02:01:26       for us to master tang was all about footwork and biomechanics and he's back in Thailand now and then that's been passed on to our next generation of coaches from. He moved back. He did move back after 11 years. Why did he decide to back to silent? Became

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       a monk for a day. It came up for a day because because his parents had died, if you don't go and live in the monastery for within a year and a half after he hadn't seen his son in 11 years since sentras for. And he, I mean he spent all his time facetiming with his family and he wasn't necessarily allowed back in the. He went and he went back, he stuck back.

Speaker 2:          02:02:02       He wasn't allowed pack. How come? Illegal. Oh, oh. So he couldn't come back to America if you went back to Thailand? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:02:10       Yeah. so when he was gone, he was gone because he overstayed a visa. So he, uh, yeah. So that's one universal. When you saw tj dillashaw my corner in Canada, that's because master tom couldn't go to Canada and tj knew everything. Every single thing that, that, that mastered tongue, like knew all his, his stuff, get a hold mitts, but he was all about that now. Which, see, that's what's great about having all these coaches like justin buckles, he knows, he knows master tongs style. He knows my style. He knows, uh, every coach you've ever had In their dwayne style. He knows, you know, anybody. Dimitri [inaudible], dimitri made dominic style. Anybody that's been in here, he knows bob, bob's my uncle bob's style. And so you get a guy like darren elkins, it needs to work on that striking and we put them with justin buckles and you know, with the cumulative part of the team, it works wonders and then you get a guy like, yeah, a year who comes in with this striking background and now we've got all these different attributes or like a sage northcutt who's with us right now that guys, hey, let's take a moment to acknowledge sage.

Speaker 3:          02:03:18       NortHcutt is the nicest guy in the planet. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:03:22       definitely. Like the nicest dude on the planet. I got into the ufc too quick, just like a little bit, but it doesn't matter. I super talented and was looking really good in some small organizations, but really didn't have a complete game yet. I'm going to tell you, he learns really, really fast. I always mess. I was a mess with cody. I was getting this kind of like, man, sage lillian's a lot faster than you. It's not really the case. I just like to fuck with this guy. But a dozen st mark's sister. That's her karate competitor. GotcHa. Yep. She just shook her first fight and she lost. Uh, but she, she, she asked some potential too. That's interesting. So he's a, he's a fun case, you know, because he's got that weIrd karate style super fast too though. I mean you would know it but he's got a little mean streak and he's, he's, he's got all the knowledge like everybody because he's nice. Everybody wants to help the guy and he is so nice. It was just like, oh thank you. Like just like learn from whoever tells them, you know, calls me, mr. Favre.

Speaker 2:          02:04:26       Mr. Favor now when you guys do a camp, lIke say you training for tj, who organizes your camp? Like how do you organize your strength and conditioning routine? How do you organize, like what are you going to do that day or

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       do you do a base on how you feel like who is, who is the coordinator?

Speaker 5:          02:04:42       Myself, basically I kinda, yeah, that's what we do. Like favorite always would preach about. It's a lifestyle change. Like if you need to do this much work you needed to do wrestling, get get guys on the team and wrestle. So I'll figure out what I need to do. Especially for this fight with tj. I know the specific work that I need, combos, what he throws, what he likes to do, it vice versa. So I get with all my coaches like, hey, I would like to have this much work with chris personally as much work with motion and movement with favor pad work. I'm uncle come out and do pad work as well. and then I get with my strength conditioning coach from going three times a week, usually one heavy day to like movement, foot work, you know, Greece in the body. Uh, so It's just always like usually on that sunday and we're like, hey, we lay it out, lay it out, lay it out.

Speaker 4:          02:05:25       So will you lay out the whole week of events? So like when you have a heavy day, say if you ever like a rock 'em sock 'em robots day the next day. Do you like to do like a yoga stretch out, do movement, hit pads? Like how do, how do you work?

Speaker 5:          02:05:38       Okay. I usually go sunday is kind of like a, uh, what do you call it? Like a shakeout kind of active rest. We're moving to that felt wherever. yeah. Yeah. So I don't feel like garbage on monday. Monday we hit it hard and usually morning practice or pad works in the afternoon. Then jujitsu, so it's usually three on mondays and tuesdays I usually just wrestle and maybe do some pad work because I like to kind of be rested for sparring, sparring. So a lot of swearIng on wednesday. And then I'll usually do a strength conditioning workout after sparring. And on thursdays usually when I like no Impact day, I usually kind of like, it's wrestling. Sometimes I'll go in there and just wrestle. If I feel good, I'll drill. I won't go live and then I'll do like yoga or more. My hyperbaric chambers have to go. I had to go towards the end of the week after the sparring because friday's a intimate practice. so it's like everything. It's you're doing sparring and they are doing the grappling.

Speaker 4:          02:06:29       So is this trial and error that's led you to this schedule that gives you like the thought to take thursday light and then go hard on friday? Monday. HArd sunday light?

Speaker 5:          02:06:38       Yeah. This is what has worked for me since I said like I came out here. Literally I was in, I was doing my own strength conditioning before I came out to team alpha male and I was hitting pads is my uncle and I go in and inspire. I wouldn't even, it may, I would do boxing would take downs. That's all we do because a lot of the boxers I was with russell or you know what I mean? So they would do, we would just do the boxing. So we need do the boxes didn't want kicked. Right. So we're just doing that. I get my work and I was working with pos battle for a lot of these boxers and cleveland and pittsburgh and I finally came out here and these guys had it like, man, a system, a system like wrestling system. That's what I do so well beCause they do the drilling.

Speaker 5:          02:07:17       You start out with this, we're going to go wrestling and then we're going to go in the clinch back to strikes fit into like, hey, it's goes from this structure. Yeah. So I didn't, I never knew knew any of that. Like first time I really change your jitsu was out here, like learning it and like blended together. I always said I was a good athlete, a good wrestler, good fight. A good boxer by I my own news style here with like going and doing really the first year that I was here I was just training like for like,

Speaker 3:          02:07:45       yeah, he actually told me, he's like, bro, this is like a little, you know, we had to tone it back a little bit. Which like I said, we have. The team was built on overtraining. It was like I didn't take a vacation for seven years when I started fighting. I mean I never took vacations growing up either. We didn't have money. It wasn't like something that we did, so I'm not like used to like, oh, we're taking a vacation, but like seven years I didn't take a vacation. And so it was like this grind, grind, grind, and everybody's kind of keeping up and we've, we've shifted and gotten smarter and have more input and etc. Etc. But the bottom line for me is this, we have a lot of advisors, right? And I like it. Sage northcutts a great example. He can, he'll, he'll listen to whoever's talking to him and like people want to talk to them all the time and tell him what to do.

Speaker 3:          02:08:32       Right? So like there's advise, there's an advisory, like we say, hey, this is the coaches and I think that you need to do this and we need to do that. But you have to be, especially at a high level like this, you have to be a thermometer for your own, for your own stuff as well. So we have set practices throughout the day, but if you're feeling way too beat up, you know, because we're not worried about guys not showing up to practice because they're lazy. We have the best athletes in the world, the rIght mentality. We trusted the mentality and the and the purposes they're in. Right? So if you're feeling too much, you got to let us know and we'll take a little back and do it there. And so this is kind of what we found for, for him as well.

Speaker 5:          02:09:09       No, when you're scheduling everything yourself, like there's two schools of thought on that. There's one school of thought that says someone should be overseeing everything for you. So you're not

Speaker 3:          02:09:17       telling you what to do. Scheduling is one thing, but what's your scheduling? Scheduling something with a coach. He's got a strength and conditioning and a physical therapists that are making. Taking that part of his thing. He's got, you know, us as head coaches over looking saying hey, we need to make sure that you're getting your, you know, this end. But there's coaches every single time for that. It's not like you're just on your own doing your course.

Speaker 5:          02:09:40       Right. Some people do do it that way. Some people like to do everything on their own,

Speaker 3:          02:09:43       which is interesting. Some people would just like to be told what to do. Just you're going to do this. Exactly. Yeah, but that. That goes away. Which ones somebody fucks you up. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:09:53       Yeah. Like my, my australian positionIng coaches, pt coaches with my mma coach, they're all in like coordinates like, okay, we went heavy with this. We should ease back this, maybe do this many rounds. So, but that's just started doing that. I think for the cruise by the first time we were a heart rate monitor and try to track where my heart rate was at. Was getting up high in the 80 [inaudible] trying to bring it back down. That's the first time I ever done that because what you what? So like when you're doing that, are you doing that for strength and conditioning? Are you doing that? Holding paths, like how you that that was literally we would throw for a 90 seconds. We would throw. We do it for six rounds. I would throw the same combo. We had three or four different combos that we'd throw for 90 seconds and just keep the input up, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Ba ba ba bump ba bump, four or five punch cabo with affairs, with the kick or wherever the heart rate's, get checked and then you wait until it gets down to what before you go again. And then I think You would have 1:40 or something.

Speaker 5:          02:10:51       I was going to down I think lower than that one. Ads. So we do that time. Have you've given yourself in recovery times in between? In between rounds. I, I like to do 45 seconds because you think middle thing for 45 seconds I got another 15 seconds of you know, recovering well usually you feel good at 30, like I'm good. I got 30 more seconds to to put it the 45 and like in the fight you're like, well because that that meant it goes fast as hell, right? Next thing you know, you're talking to your coaches, you got your bell rung, get stitched her, your eyes fixed, and they back up there. So it's like 45 seconds. Let's keep going because that here you are, you're 25, right? Twenty six, 2016 champion of the world. When you look at your future, you look at your, like your potential future in the sport.

Speaker 5:          02:11:39       I mean you could be a gigantic fucking superstar. You have the world is your oyster, right? Like how do you, how do you plan on, do you, do you have like this sort of a master plan for your career? You know, what my goal is so long to be the world champion and I grind and towards the head that go, I got that goal and I accomplished that. And then it was boom, right into the ultimate fighter boom injury boomed, fight postponed. So I was like, I haven't been able to really, really sat down because it's like, well, you know, when you're in training, you're focused on something. For me, I'm a creature of habit. I like routine. Um, so we have just recently now sat down and like we've said about it, you know, everyone can win the championship, everyone can be a world title to what you do at the title.

Speaker 5:          02:12:21       Now I've set these goals to build my legacy, you know, to start going on and who knows, who knows what can happen in a year or so because I didn't think I was going to be injured, you know, I never thought I'd be out this long, you know, that this is the most tiny time of my life because I couldn't do something that I love to do. And been in pain. Injured. How long have you been injured? For many years. It's been since junior year I started having back problems from football and yeah. So ball on and off. Yeah. Fucking football. Fuck. So what apple says all the time, all the time. That damn foosball. And so I've, I've dealt it but progressive. It was the henry is fight was the fight that I almost pulled out of that fight was the first five report besides obviously tj had to postpone it.

Speaker 5:          02:13:03       Um, I couldn't walk, but sean shelby a gathered window maddix and our story and that he wanted to walk, so I just told them and my back was really bad. Then I'm, so that's when it really started to come on. And then I didn't fight for after the henry fight and flight for nine months, 10 months. And then I got the usi kept booking me. I fought augusta mendez was supposed to fight, um, other brazilian linacre. He got sick the week of the fight replacement and then fight hand in almeda and then it was ms dot [inaudible]. Then it was crew. So I didn't have time to be like really? I just dealt with the pain, like there was times where I would take two weeks off of like really training, doing anything or it would switch side and my left side or my right side. So I always go south.

Speaker 5:          02:13:48       Paul until that side started messing up. I switched back to orthodox. Like it was a lot of like sometimes working around working around it [inaudible] I had to because I get my money right for that regina king procedure. And how did that go? You know, what, it felt good. I feLt like It took the, you know, inflammation inflammation away so it stopped like locking up and sitting the shop, you know, the shocks down my leg. Um, but still I was, I've been doing rehab since and I've been doing rehab one day, wednesday and friday and obviously on tuesday, thursday do lifting. So I've been doing rehab and getting to because I feel like a better athlete, I'm moving more. But still it's like from being constantly wrestling, sansar, boxing stance, being like that now I really pride myself open and it's the muscles around it are still, you know, I just had a little scare a couple weeks ago.

Speaker 5:          02:14:34       We're good, you know, we're moving on from that. I feel way better. My back backfields way stronger. Um, I wasn't aBle to fight July 8th, like there's no way. Uh, we try to get optimistic about it. Going to Germany and thinking that was going to heal miracle miracle, miracle shots. And maybe would have been if you took more time off or time off thing. It's like you're a pro athlete, so like you're not just having these procedures and then taking a long time to recover, you're having these procedures and then trying to get back to training and pretty quick literally like, you know, I had that fight so it was literally seven weeks out from when I had the first stem. So, and then I take a month off, take four weeks off and then two weeks of trying to solve leaves me with a week and a half to train for my title fight.

Speaker 5:          02:15:19       Like you guys understand that it's insane and that doesn't even make sense. So you are a October 7th is the fight, right? November fourth, November 4th. Madison square. Oh, that's right. why the fuck that? I think. Okay. That makes that stuff. That makes it hard, I guess. I mean I got hit by a couple of news outlets. I was fighting october. I'm like, yeah, that's the vegas vegas card. Who's on that card? Who is Kevin Lee? I think that sort of ferguson. Kevin lee for the interim. One hundred 55 pound title. Yeah. That whole interim thing is so crazy right? They Just sort of randomly decide when they're going to have that title, how they do that. I remember dominick cruz had it for a long time and they let him keep it for a long time and there's some guys they just like, all right, you're done. That's what I was with the whole thing that I said, I'm not rushing back. If you guys want to make an interim title or take the title from me, that's fine. I'm 25 years. I'm going to. I'm going to get the title back. I got it here. I'm going to get it back if that's where it happened. So I didn't want anyone to sit, you know, tj wanted to go down fighting dj because that was my thing. I texted john and dan [inaudible] I can make 25. That was my whole game plan was to fight tj July 8th and I got her pull out and it was going to fight

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       dj a massive. So regarding. So I was always in my mind was going to fight in november, massive square garden. It just a different opponent. Well somebody's gotta fight dj. I was kinda bummed out that demetrius decided not to fight tj our video. I'd never even knew that was an option just to be like, I'm not going to fight. Well, he said, and I guess his mindset is that he's one fight away from breaking the record of the most title defenses ever. And if tj being down, being able to beat up anyone in the world and your weight. Yes. Which is the important thing to think about there. Yes it is, but if he lost a tj and tj didn't make the weight, it would fuck them up. Like if tj decided not to, if he couldn't make the weight. It's a lot of ifs.

Speaker 4:          02:17:16       There's a lot of assets a lot. So he wanted tj to fight one time I would make sure you can make the and then fight them. I guess it makes sense, but the other thought processes your, the pound for pound best fighter on the planet. You should be fighting the best fight that you can get and that's a really good fight. It's like no one's floyd didn't make sure economy gregory could make the weight. No, they just booked the fight and the light on them as a professional, and jon jones wouldn't fight shale though. That's because he hated shale though. That was part of part of it. It was like, fuck this guy. This guy might have a possibility of beating me. He goes, no, I'll, I'll do this through a real camp. And he goes, I'm not going to come in here and take this on short notice.

Speaker 4:          02:17:57       I don't know man. I mean he took the osp fight on short notice and it wasn't his best fight. You know, he sort of prides himself on having a long game plan and that's his mentality to man, this whole thing is so depressing with john. Apparently we're gonna find out soon what's going to happen with the b sample, you know, but if the b sample test positive as well, he's kind of doomed. This is doing what, what would be three or four years, four years. Let that belief. I mean obviously I'm not the fucking athletic commissioner. You saw it or whoever calls it out, but I think the first one was what? Well, the first one was an out of competent. No, the first one was a tainted supplement and they gave him a year. Right? Didn't it give me a year for the dick pills. So was it really dick pills?

Speaker 4:          02:18:44       So it was the other test to the pills blockers. They put those in these estrogen. In these messages. Gas station dick pills. Yeah, because they make you excited. They block your estrogen, fill you up with. I mean look, they could put whatever the fuck they want in those things is trying to get your dick hard. Not. They're not thInking that a world class world champion professional athletes taken me of 11 gets he's a maniac. But don't you think though, I mean this is what I've always said, that world class fighters, like professional fighters are not like any other athlete because they're fucking reckless. They're wild motherfuckers like cowboy like you. Like a lot of guys, they are impulsive, reckless risk taking people. Oh, you know, I don't know. I mean, I guess I guess disciplined for sure. I mean a professional cali kid, you know, you're, you're definitely different.

Speaker 4:          02:19:38       But there's a lot of different guys in the sport, you know, that have, you know, different personalities, but a lot of fighters, it's a big percentage that are wild. And john's fucking wild. Like if you want to get a wild motherfucker like john who opens up his fight at 23 years old fighting shogun for the world title with a flying knee against shogun. I mean that's how I opened the fight. That's, that's a wild impulsive dude. He just go, feels it and goes with it. Flow state. Yeah. And feels like pop them gas station dick pills, just like,

Speaker 2:          02:20:08       let's just do these red lining that all the time. There's no like, well,

Speaker 4:          02:20:14       I mean he had all the excuses, you know, the cocaine was just partying. The dick pills. That's more of the same. now this one though is a different thing. This is an actual. He's not saying anything. No one's saying no, no official statement. Talk to my lawyer. Yeah. I mean they're saying they didn't do anything, you know, that would Be the most fucked up thing in the world if somebody slipped some shit into your water. You know, just to get you to test positive, but you got to watch everything you fucking eat. I mean, you always have to think. People definitely do double cross people. Definitely in this world, there's somebody who would absolutely put something tainted in your food. All they have to do is sprinkle a little bit, a little bit of it in a dish of food. You wouldn't even notice it. I made you really think that's what happened. I don't think anything. I don't know anything.

Speaker 2:          02:20:56       I wonder. I mean that's true though. I mean they're so fucking evil people out there. That's one thing I've learned is getting older is like just being a nice guy. You assume everyone's nice and good and it's like there's some creepy negative people out there

Speaker 4:          02:21:11       there. Man. It's beautiful when you find nice people because of that though, it balances it out. So when you know people that you can trust that really are your brother, that's like, that makes it all the more it'll give. Everybody was cool. You wouldn't necessarily appreciate cool people as much. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean that'd be good

Speaker 2:          02:21:26       everywhere. Whereas all the dishes get mad. I need an enemy. That is. Have you ever fought somebody that you really liked? I thought a bunch of guys. Who'd you fight that you really liked? Your. I liked? Uh, charlie valencia. Brian bowls. I like scotty jorgensen. I liked eddie wineland. You're friends with those guys. Michael mcdonald. I was friends with all this guy's weird, right? I could say probably one who ms dot gawky just because he didn't speak english, but honestly I was like, man, he's like, but cody from the get go. He goes, hey man, I know you're cool to your opponents. Everything. BUt I like, I like intensity. I like if I, like people say that he's got a temper everything and he's like, yeah, it's, he's fighting this guy. He's getting that mentality. That's part of what he liked. My thing is I will either you whip your ass, whip my ass. I'm always going To show you respect after like, hey, you know, it's good. I remembered that when I got signed, I fought marcus image and

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       I don't like shaking my opponent's hand before the fight. I never liked that. I never liked glove touching any of that in markets. We, I saw him a couple times in the hotel. He's like, what's up man? Like, I got it. Cool man. Good to see you saturday. You know what I mean? And I taught them before weigh ins. I was like, hey, you know, go on stage. Like, hey, I don't want to shake your hand out there. Don't make me look like a dick. Like if I go to shit, you know, it's cool. It's cool. Yeah, right on w w I said I got respect for you. I promise show and I'm like walking away. I'm like all right. Any like shook his hand out there. And I was like in my mind like it was. Oh. So I shook it again. And recalling back to buckle's was like, he got me again with the handshake.

Speaker 5:          02:23:01       I didn't even realize exactly. It puts us on to come up and be like, hey, I don't want to shake your hand, let's fight. But how about the throat bridge against tourists and against no love man, because he wears that thing where that's our goal. So what are you doing? You're the video game. The, um, the post fight press conference. Uh, I had a lot of respect for dominick cruz. The way you handled that. He just, he didn't know excuses, like took it like a man. So he was a Better man. He beat me. I got no excuses. there's nothing I could say. Yeah, for sure. No, definitely we've had our differences and still might not. He still has me blocked on instagram and twitter, but man, top sheet on my wife's a photo and then blocked me. I'm like, this motherfucker that shit up.

Speaker 5:          02:23:53       I'm like, you blocked me. Like trying to be cool to do an interview in it. Don was trying to needle cody cody's like this. I didn't even know what was going on, what was happening. I was doing the fox for the ultimate fighter. It was obviously karen. Brian asked about me grabbing teacher by his throat. Like, yeah, he goes anD me and dominic got into a altercation at wayne's at two. OH seven. I come out. I'm just waiting. I had my hands full with all the paperwork bullshit they give us. And george gave me all these waters and refuel stuff, so I come out of the door and I crossed paths with dava quite didn't know, didn't even register with him, but I might prefer you. I catch something and I kinD of like turned back around and He was like, had these sunglasses on, like these big chicken sunglasses.

Speaker 5:          02:24:36       Yeah. Split up news like kicked out of you skinny little motherfucker. And I was like, oh. I was like, dude, we're fighting tomorrow man. I was like, so good. I was just laughing, like really? Like he wants to do it now. The first time we saw each other a day before we were in this split room, this, this much or we're talking shit to each other on a camera. I'm like, well we can't do like sit down and obviously like that he has Jeremy Stevens in there and I'm like man he got in. Steve's a good little boy, like talking, like just riding off of dom's hype or off is off don. LIke he brought in a self proclaimed savage and Jeremy Stevens like to counterbalance that I was portraying to be a savage. That's what he kept saying. I'm like, like I was like, I'll come over back.

Speaker 5:          02:25:15       Both of you guys right now, took my earpiece off. I ran through the securIty and then he was saying I was throwing shit. It just the whole buildup. So we finally saw each. I was like, man, it was, I got beat your ass tomorrow. Like walk it off like I to just hide it. and I see Jeremy Stevens, ray, he's all puffed up. He's like, you're too small little dude. He's like, give me one of your teammates. And I was like, I dropped all my shit and get ready to hit. I'm like, man, I'll leave. My manager comes out of nowhere, swoops jeremy up. But he grabbed me like he like scratched my neck, had a big scratch on it from his nails a little bit now. And like, so it was that. And then, uh, that whole car. So he gets on skype or not skype.

Speaker 5:          02:25:54       Fox sports is about to do an interview Interview about the situation of tough. Karen brian asked that and he goes, he said, come. He's like, hey, just a little dick. You know, he just, you know, whatever, you can respect him for what he did and he, he, because he knows that I always said that he knew what he had to do in that media for people not to hate him. You know, look how connor and raley sometimes they will change a little bit after he lost he, he took us home a pine, a respect them for that. But I knew deep down that wasn't turmoil in their exact. It has to be a dance all over his ass. You know what I mean? He's a great fighter. I embarrassed him, you know, saturDay really go. Oh. So I come on and I'm split. Coolest. Cool.

Speaker 5:          02:26:33       I respect Him. Like, hey, hat's off. Get a tough, tough dude. We talked after. I was like, yeah, that guy's tough. Like I'll been pictured in this and would come on and say hey, you're getting joined with dominic. And I'm like, oh cool. Like that's cool. Like, like it has to be brief that we're professionals. Like okay. So iT goes on about things like, yeah. Have you ever been choked up at wayans? And if so, what would you do? And I'm like, really thinking about this. I'm like, well, you know, hopefully that will be professional enough to keep my composure and know that I'm going to whip this dude's ass tomorrow. And then he was like, huh? Like just being a smart ass. And he was like, oh, he'S sick. So he didn't mean to tell me you never been choked up. And that dawned on me, I was like, oh, are you talking about when you brought your self proclaimed hype man in and scratch my, my neck with his little bitch now?

Speaker 5:          02:27:15       and he's like, no, no. I was like, hey dominic. I said, what happened in the fight? I said, I danced around you and beat your ass and made you look like a fool. I said, sit behind a desk and shut up. And then it was like this that go on skype. Just as old as a private conversation. Private conversations goes black screen, the producers come on, we're like, we're sorry how dominic was acting like, I don't mind coming on here and doing this shit, but I. The first thing I said, hey dominic, how are you? And I was like, oh, just waiting for dominic's and say hi. And he started off. He goes, I don't get to say hi to you, I'm talking to you in a couple of minutes. and I was like, oh god, what the fuck you guys are probably going to fight again if tom stays in the game.

Speaker 5:          02:27:49       So we had to redo the whole sItuation and he just sitting there like, you know, because I was like, man, that's cool. So that's why I wanted the rematch with them. so honestly tj should thank don for not taking the rematch and finally getting his shot. So that's why after the fight. So tj tom Doing these days, you know, I know he has plantar fasciitis, got some serious issues with his feet because he came back real quick after the knee surgery anD maybe pushed it a little too hard. That's a, that's a tough one. I mean tHat's why his feet were all taped up. He's doing a lot of commentary on. Yeah, I'm probably getting decent manager that I talked to his coach. They're going to try to get, you know, we didn't win, it was scheduled, but he was trying to fight on the same cart or around about.

Speaker 5:          02:28:31       So it keeps in the transition. Who do you think would be a good fight for him to fight for? Dominic? It's a good question. WIthout a riviera. Very good fight. Very good fight. But I think doesn't he? Doesn't jimmy have a fight? He just beat the dude that you knocked out. Oh, he alomeda he'd be, he'd be out. Dropped him a couple times. That was. Yeah, it was a very good fight. That's already beat it. I made it, but I feel like he has another fight lined up. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it was. I'm thinking of um, you know, the day Before the fight, like hype before the fight is always so interesting to see how people react, see where their head's at. Like when connor came out with a heart on against floyd. What is, what is he doing? Is he fucking wearing a rubber band around his ticket balls just to get it hard?

Speaker 5:          02:29:16       Or is he playing with himself before he gets out there? a couple shakes before he gets on his fucking dick was half hard, but he's standing there hard and that's just what it looks like when it's limp, but it literally looked like it was half hard when he's standing there at the wind. Like a siren. The hill. I've seen a couple of the guys, I think mcgill dixit way and a couple other guys that had that same thing. I think it's like an involuntary thing that happens when you're like hungry or something. I dunno. I'll tell you what. Get survival. We have to go. We haD to get real creative on the physical anthropology of why you get a hard out when you're about to get into confrontation. Maybe you're going to fight over a female out the nature and I can maybe. It was just such a weird problem when stinks.

Speaker 5:          02:30:03       Confrontation to connor screaming, yelling at him or for just standing there literally like not a worry in the world. It was interesting how floyd handled it. Yeah. He didn't have a worry in the world. We're seeing that. I see composed because you know, you're so composed 50 and oh man, 15. Oh, you know, I'd said that he was the only guy that ever reached that and break that record, but apparently there was some other guy that had fought and I'm like a really light weight that made 51 zero. Oh really? Yeah. That I didn't even know. I thought they were talking about rocky marciano. I was taught that that was the record for the child is it? Wasn't he like up there before he got defeated too? Good question. But he didn't retire with question one was like six years. RicArdo lopez? Yeah. He was a. What wait was. He doesn't say light flyweight yeah. What? What is that? What is light flyweight? Minimum waiting. Jesus minimum. Wait, what the fuck is minimum way. But ricardo lopez a. Maybe he, I believe he retired at 51 and. Oh. Oh, he retired somewhere around that range. Does it say one girl? Yeah. Oh, we had to draw 50. One wins, zero losses and one draw. The one draws the. It's so funny. People about that shit. It's so

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       weird. That's one thing about mma fighters as opposed to boxers. Boxer who was always undefeated record. That was like, that's such a big selling point in the. In the.

Speaker 2:          02:31:31       Yeah, anD I guess it makes sense though because I mean you're trying to make a case that nolan could, you know, there's something intriguing about somebody that can, that no one could ever beat this person,

Speaker 4:          02:31:41       but the difference between mma and boxing and mma, you're tested way more on the way up to the title and you're fighting world class fighters pretty quickly soon as you start getting to zero. Whereas in boxing you're taking care of your record, gets pad and you're slowly worked up to a world class fighter. If you have a good manager,

Speaker 2:          02:31:58       maybe 15 to 20 fights and you're trying to maybe start fighting some. OkAy. People, you know, especially with you. And again, do you think that that's the way to do it now? No. With those guys know, because a lot of those boxers have had three, 400 amateur fights. Not like they don't need groomed into. That may be to get out of the shoe shining amateur style, but switching notes, a headgear getting taken away. It's more, you know, it's, it's set up and the point system, how it's changing with the olympics, you know, taken into headgear off and how they're changing all that. So they're coming more professional, setting stuff up, not that, you know, pitter patter shit to shine, you know, that that's how it's been. But I don't think they need to be, be like that. But I think in boxing is a huge records.

Speaker 2:          02:32:41       Like, oh, he's 37. Oh it's 28 knockout we're gig. I mean I guess the difference with, with, with ufc is use has always had a reputation of putting the best fighters against the best fighters, which I think has gone away a little bit. I mean they still make sure you get testeD. Do you think it's gone away? I don't think it's going away. I think when they try to do is have even matchups because there's like, like a uh, ricci and uh, and, and what's his name? Who's fighting alvarez for example? They just want to see that fight. I mean, they're both very tough guys. It can be a champion and and her just teaching, but they want to see matches, but they do that all the way down. Like tHey're not gonna, they're not trying to set up mismatches. They're, they're trying to get it more evenly matched, but that doesn't mean that there aren't guys that they could set up with mismatches within the, within the

Speaker 4:          02:33:37       god get a tune up fight. We're in boxing. It's a big deal. Or boxing guys get tuned up fights and you even call them a tune up fight. He's getting a tune up fight before the big match. Yeah. You know, and they go in there and they fight a guy that's not expected to win and then they get sent off for the next fight but at tunes theM up, get some sharp and then they have the world championship fight.

Speaker 2:          02:33:57       When that happens to get into the ufc a lot though, a lot for me, I have over half of my professional fights are in the ufc. I signed a five and no, and you know, so I have my plates or been in the ufc against, you know, ufc obviously you can say the primary organization with

Speaker 4:          02:34:14       spiders, it's not even close, but it's getting close now. You know, wHen you look at what bellah tor is doing right now, it's, ufc is always going to be the top of the food chain. It's always like the premier organization as far as the public knows. But as far as the quality of talent, bella tour, at least finally as Roy Mcdonald, you know, they finally have all the that are growing. They are as well. Yeah, you're right. But I mean getting um, you know, gay harden, blue, saucy, worldclass guys, we're like legitimately with pay. Yeah. I mean rory has a victory over tyron woodley and a victory of a daemon maya. So he had a victory over the one and nuMber two guys,

Speaker 3:          02:34:50       it's interesting you just mentioned roy can go back to what we're talking about with training rory. I mean that's a guy who, he's a strange character and like I wonder what goes on is what's his motivation for fighting? And what started him, et cetera, but I saw him do a, uh, uh, an interview about his training. He's like, I'm like, I talked about coaches making you do shit just in. You're just like, do whatever the coach says. He was like, look, I've been doing with all the coaches say, he's like, I'm gonna. I keep getting hurt. I keep doing this. And now he goes, I'm going to take things into my own hands a little bit more. You know, he's the guy that did that, but he's, he's having a lot of friggen success too. He looked like a fucking world killer. And he'd be paul daley. He looked perfectly savage to. Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:35:33       Yes. That's gonna be an interesting fight. Paul daley and lorenz larkin. Oh yeah. Explosive style. Supercycle kicks. Yeah. I'll just. How this longer than use. Nope. Nolan's lorenz larkin just fought douglas lema for the title. We lost a five round decision. Very close fight. Very good fight. Douglas slam is another one. That guy is world class. I mean, he is. He's right up there with anybody in the world at one 70, in my opinion. He's been around for awhile too. Yeah. Yeah. You know what pisses me off is ben aspirins still fighting over in one fc like jesus christ I, I am the number one district of his retirement fight. That's. It drives me crazy. Should've been the ufc a long time ago. I always wanted to see that

Speaker 3:          02:36:17       pissed off. Dana and his style is weird, right?

Speaker 4:          02:36:19       The style is weird. That's one thing, but pissing off dana was ultimately the end of it all. I mean, he was talking some serious shit. Yeah, that's too bad. That's too bad. Really bad. I will have it mixed up with this guy and fuck you. I would have loved to see that guy fight the best in the world in the ufc, you know, and we'll never know. Now. It's really unfortunate. He made some decent money over there and I hope you did. I hope we did. He's just a fucking phenomenal grappler, man. Here's a perfect example. That guy destroyed larkin on the ground or it's not locking lima destroyed him on the ground and destroyed core cuff on the ground just to be manhandled. Those dudes got a. Of those guys was ragdoll and fools. Just throwing them around like that. An orthodox weird wrestling style. I wouldn't have wanted to see him fight the best guys.

Speaker 3:          02:37:09       Yeah. You know who had been a. He would have been a terrible matchup for is george st pierre was. George always

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       saw he starts hitting his nice little shots, but he always ends up getting the nice tape now. But how was he going to do in grappling against? Asked her. That would've been a good one. I saw and I always wanted to see too. Well, you know that got him in trouble with johny hendricks. Right. But johnny hunters is a different Johnny Hendricks back then. Yeah, sure. Interesting. You saw this trip and changing lives, bro. I sit that I. That's, that's one of the thing that makes me want to get back into it is now that you saw it as an. I still have you saw to test me just in case there's an opportunity that pops up because yeah, they, they pop in all the time. 60 a buck 60 right now. What do you book? 60. Do you think you could get done look up anyone in the world?

Speaker 2:          02:37:56       Absolutely. That's my guy. He'll come in and he does practices with us and shit will always give them a hard time like, oh, he's still got it. you still gotta? Yeah, he's retired. Are you kind of retired? Mostly. Mostly retired. I'm retired. I, I'm, I'm definitely retired, but I'm not a first off. I love the fight. That's the hard thing about retiring is it takes so much time, energy and there's so much to learn that I'm definitely a better fighter when I retired than I than I was when I was in my prime. Meaning as far as skillset goes, but like there's a lot of skill guys out there and it's just like a focus thing and a motivation thing like. So you wish there were, you saw it. It was there the entire career. Oh god. Are you kidding me? Hell, you ever feel any temptation when you knew that so many guys were using shade?

Speaker 2:          02:38:50       I had, I had a couple week. We'll sit down and try to talk me into it before they tried to talk you into just like, hey, you know, like everybody's doing it but this and that, blah, blah, blah. I forget What the. Somebody had talked about it and I had a coach a long time ago that was like, hey everybody. And I'm like, no, I don't think so. I, I take a lot of pride in the fact that I had in my career and I didn't. I'm like oblivious. I'm like, like, you knoW, like when you're not In the circle, you're definitely not in the circle. Yeah. They don't tell you, tell you. They don't want to tell you, you know, everything else. So I, I think a lot of pride in the fact that. And I, and I teach to my guys and that's one of the conversations I've had with cody.

Speaker 2:          02:39:36       I'm like, bro, you know, we don't need any of that shit. Dude. That's all mental. It's a mental thing. The problem is that the differences when you have someone that strong mentally that is like a scientist on himself and also has all the attributes, then it matters, right? When you get a guy in math class fighter and then on top of that they take some shit and then yeah, they have the mentality, right? If everybody's doing it mentalities, which allows like champions to do it as well. Right. This champion never did it. Congratulations. Thanks. Beautiful. I mean, all right, let's wrap this bitch up. Good luck man. Can't wait to see you. Madison square garden. That's November 4th,
