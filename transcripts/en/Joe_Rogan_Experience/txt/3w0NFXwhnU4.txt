Speaker 1:          00:04          I have dreams. I have fucking crazy dreams. I had a dream one time that me and Elvis walked into his hotel room and there were four dudes, but fucking right, and I just hear me where they were. Suggestions that might be one of the best sentences ever created. It's weird. Or they're throwing up in Burger King Cups, fucking each other, and then I as wordy when I say this, I fucking just shut the door. And I looked at Elvis. I go, what the fuck's going on in your room? He said to me, what's your Dream Baby? Oh Shit. I wake up, I wake up. I'm like, wake up. Check my, make sure it's hard. I'm like, well, you don't really flipped me out. Do you know what really flipped me out? Not that, not that the guys were both fucking right. They didn't ask. No. It was the product placement.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Like what the fuck the Burger can do to get it? How the fuck fucking dream figured it out and you just don't know that they are. It's way to interject advertising into your dream. It's the burger king in the future right now. It's like I got her Chrysler stream about the Elvis and the buck fucking Haha. No, no, no. But what is, there's a possibility that someone could insert a product to a dream. Right? But they could give you a cheeseburger and in that cheeseburger with some experimental thing that would make you think about burger king in a dream and see a burger and a dream, you can do it. You can do it. I'm fucking a girl from Geico and shit. But that doesn't make any sense cause yeah. Cause it's Geico eat something to have this happen to you. We're still, we're still missing the whole package. We're stumbling on something very brilliant right now.
