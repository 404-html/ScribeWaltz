Speaker 1:          00:00          Trey my day, Joe Rogan plot gas by night all day. No, your life is very different right now. That it was a year ago. It is. How crazy is that? Yeah. I like you. A year ago you were talking about like not doing this anymore. I've got to figure out what I'm doing and now you're the fucking world champ

Speaker 2:          00:20          about a frickin one 80. Yeah. Mike. Mike career in life with it couldn't have been different a year ago than it is now.

Speaker 1:          00:27          How strange is that? How that can just like that in an instant. You just never know. What does that feel like? It's like when you wake up in the morning, you have to go, okay, I wake up this morning, that's real. P diddy

Speaker 2:          00:42          real. I'm, I'm happy. It's, um, it's enlightening. It's fun. It's, it's great to be the champ. I love it. Honestly. It's a completely different thing. And Yeah. You know, a year ago I was so frustrated because, you know, when I lost her onto the last time, I knew I had a lot, a long road, you know, and to, to work my way back up. But I thought I had done that and when I beat Jessica, I, it was announced like, you know, this is going to be then the number one contender eliminator fight. And then afterwards they're like, yes it is. You're going to fight Ronda. Then I felt like the carpet was kind of just pulled out from under my feet because they're like, just kidding. Holly's, you know, holly's fighting. And they announced it without telling me. So that's why I was so upset because I was like, I don't take that shit lightly, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:20          Yeah. Like I was training my ass off already. I had already reached out to um, a girl in France. I can't say her name right. I think it's like [inaudible], I don't know some French name, but she beat Ronda and judo. So I had already like been making plans with her to train with her and fire over here and she was changing things. Then I was like, I feel like such an ass, like I feel like an idiot. Right. They look like an idiot because here the announcement was made and I didn't even know. So I was kind of upset about that. But you know, we talked about it and we smooth things over and, and I took it personally at the time, but I don't think it was meant personally and it was a business decision and I understand that that at the end of the day that's what it was and it all worked out. So

Speaker 1:          01:55          the UFC is in a weird position because they're both a promoter and sort of a sanctioning body. Yup. And that's really rare and matter of fact, I can't think of any other sport where that exists. Yeah. You know, they have just this ability to decide like they'll dealt us decide like this person gets a show. Like the whole conor mcgregor situation is a perfect example of that. Like all of a sudden if he had beaten nate diaz or if he had beaten dos Anjos like dos Anjos didn't get injured and he beat beat Dos Anjos you fucking know for sure they were going to have him fight Robbie lawler. Yeah. Like for sure. And they were just going to like figure out a way to do something with 145 Palm Tata. And why wouldn't they do it if they were business people because that's where the money is.

Speaker 1:          02:36          I mean it would've been if he had beat those on Joe's and then when on and fought Robbie law or Jesus Christ when we talk to like a 5 million paper view by event it, they'd have to do it. It would be insane. But if that was like a sanctioning body, like you've seen it before in like boxing, like someone won't take a mandatory challenger and they get stripped even when they just won the title, it happens all the time. Like we're a phytol would just win the title and then they have this mandatory challenger who nobody knows and they'll go, fuck that fight. I'm going to go fight Canelo Alvarez, I'm going to fight this guy or that guy. And then he gets stripped. Like, cause there's like five different sanctioning bodies. Like boxing is way more of a mess. So there's like pros and cons to doing it the way the UFC does it. But from a point of view of someone like you, it's probably much more frustrated.

Speaker 2:          03:20          Well, you just never know what to expect. Like you, you get curve balls all the time in the UFC. Don't know what to expect. You know, like a lot of people were so pissed off at me for, for the Holly Holm, not having the rematch right away, but it's like, it's not, it's not my choice. You know, they have this of you, I don't know, cause they think that I like turned it down or I should have went in there like guns a blazing for holly and like put myself out of my shield. Like, no, we have to have the holly rematch. You guys, you don't understand. But um, yeah, they call me up. I'm like, Amanda, July 9th. I'm like, okay. Yeah. How did he notice UFC 200 how the fuck do you say no, no you don't. You can't say no if that's what they come up with you like I'm in and now you know, it's like, dude, relax.

Speaker 2:          04:03          Most people don't get immediate rematches in their career. Like, unless you are conor mcgregor or Rhonda or, or you know, someone that's really got a presence, you don't get an immediate rematch. Like I did when I went back and strike force when, when I lost to Ronda, I didn't get into media. I've never gotten immediate rematch. My career, I would love to immediately rematch cat when I lost to her. But you don't get it. Sometimes you got to work your way back up and you know, hope for the best, but we will. I'm sure it will fight each other again. She's fighting a volunteer mission. Shanko now just say I have to laugh when people say like that we're scared to fight someone. You know, like people were like, oh, you're scared to fight holly again. Like you can't listen to those people are scared is not a relative. Like it's not a term that I feel like fighters really, we don't, we don't have scared the way normal people have scared, you know? Yeah. Like a normal person would be scared to, to, to get off their couch and go to the gym, you know, to, to spar or something. Like, that's what we do. Like we live like what most people would shit their pants to do on a day

Speaker 1:          05:00          fool to not know that it's a dangerous fight. So it's not a matter of not being aware of the danger. Yeah, but it's a matter of managing the consequences are like, I think he did a fantastic job with the holly fight, like literally you did in that fight other than the fifth round, which is the most amazing part of it. But you did everything. Like when we were talking about like what you have to do to beat her. I'm like, she's gotta stay on the outside. You get a very her rhythm and she's got to let holly come to her. Like she can't rush in because if you rush into holly, it's like Russian into Machida are rushing to anyone who's a great counter striker and you saw the Rhonda fight. Ronda just came bulldog and honor and tried to out bulldogger and you just, you can't do that with holly. She's too fast. Footwork to her, her striking is so precise. Her, her counters are so clean and our movements

Speaker 2:          05:46          very hard to read, like it's very unpredictable. I remember what a couple times I tried to maybe come forward and get her to get to the fence and I couldn't tell whether she was going to jet out to the right to the left. Like she, she's like two steps back left. And I was like, ah, you know, like I couldn't even tell like she had gave no indication of which way she was going to go.

Speaker 1:          06:02          Yeah. Well you just did a fantastic job of varying, your approach to your speed was different. Like you, you, you did a lot of fainting, you varied things up a lot and you could tell like, she was like almost like waiting for these moments to happen when you're going to come forward and then you wouldn't come forward. And then it becomes like a test of patience. Like who's going to get outside of their comfort zone? Who's going to take chances? Who's going to, who's going to engage. And she also has that weird stance too when she kind of halfway stands like a boxer and halfway stands like a karate person. She throws like a lot of sidekicks and on the front leg techniques. Yeah, she's, she's, she's a tricky one but we put together a really good game plan and I was happy with that.

Speaker 1:          06:42          He did, but it was the fifth round, fifth round was crazy. God, when you grabbed a hold of her and then eventually got her back and got her to the ground, it was so crazy because every aspect of from your initial entrance to the take down to getting her back, there was nothing 100% about it. It was all touch and go. It was all scramble. It wasn't like you had complete total control over like maybe like Damien Maia versus Rick Story. Like he, Damien Maia gets rick stories back. He's got them locked up and then he anacondas and squeeze some and then it gets them. It wasn't like that. It was like you were fighting for your fucking life and you knew there was no time. There was no time. You were likely down by like at least one round and you were headed into the fifth and final round and maybe if you won that round you could've got the decision.

Speaker 1:          07:30          But fuck, you're fighting the champ. Who knows, who knows what's going to happen. You take our back and then when she tries to shake you off the top and you hang in there and you hang in there and you see if you like, and I would watch them like, oh my God, she's going to go out. And when she went out and you climbed off her and she was unconscious like Holy Shit, Holy Shit, what a moment. And I wasn't gonna ratable. It was incredible. It was one of the best moments in all of women's championship fighting as far as like, like an extreme, extremely dramatic moment where your, you're trying to accomplish something. She's fighting tooth and claw. Neither one of you are exhausted. So it's not like anyone's like physically compromised. It's just a fucking mad scramble between two killers and you get her and you got her back and then you get it back and you'd sink the choking. And she's trying to fucking shake you off and you hung in the APP and when she rolled and you're on top of her and you hung onto it and you realize like, oh my God, she's going out. And she just, she didn't even tap, she was throwing punches in the air while you were choking her unconscious.

Speaker 2:          08:34          I think to myself, I'm like, when is she going to tap? It didn't in my, in that instinctual moment, I'm so used to in training you get people in a choke, you know they tapped. So I'm waiting for that tap and I'm like, good God. Like when is this girl going to tap? Like I know I've got, or what does she hit tab and then, then I felt her like I saw her, you know, from my peripherals kind of do, do something. I wasn't quite sure if she was tapping or what she was until I watched the video later and then I felt him pull me off and I'm like, that's the feeling that we fight for is that feeling that that feeling of like I did it, I established my dominance. You know, it's a, it's a, you know, it's a prideful sport in some ways, you know, hand to hand combat with someone else. It's like, you know, I, I did it tonight. It was better.

Speaker 1:          09:12          It has to be prideful because otherwise there's just certain sacrifices into certain fires that you're just not going to walk through. Like you have to have every fucking motivation. You have to be Zahn, but you also have to have an ego. There's to be so many things going on. If you do achieve that highest level of greatness, it's like walking on a tight rope, you know? Oh yeah,

Speaker 2:          09:32          we'll let her just like that perfect balance. You know, I'm walking between buildings that are, you know, hundreds of stories high or, you know, and then it's like, it's, it's Kinda like that. I mean, you have to have the perfect balance and everything has to meet perfectly. And that moment, including the training camp, not overtraining. Did you ever hear of that video that um, the video is not that good, but the audio is, is awesome. It's between the fourth and fifth round and it's my corners. What they're telling me between the fourth and fifth round. It's such an emotional video for me. When I watched it, it makes me relive that moment. And Brian came in there and essentially he was like, Misha, you've got to get, after you got to, you have got to put your chin down and Mike Tyson, this chick. And that basically means just get after her like get, get in there, get after it, take the risk, risk getting knocked out, go for broke.

Speaker 2:          10:17          And um, it goes, you know, plays into the round and, and basically it was just telling me like fucking Mike Tyson, her like get after her, you know, bulldog or do whatever you've got to do. He's like, cause you're running out of time. And I remember in that fifth round still trying to get out of that, that mindset of like, I have to find the perfect opportunity. I have to be patient because the whole training camp was, you know, patient but persistent, you know, patient but persistent. No one run into anything cause you, you know you get caught, you get knocked out, you'll get need, you'll get kicked, you'll get punched. So don't do that. But you got to look for the, the opening when it's the right timing. It's all about timing. And after I took her down in that second round and I just beat her up that round, she was so, I'm so cautious and the third and fourth and so perfect.

Speaker 2:          11:00          You know, her game plan was perfect. Do to beat me to stay just far enough out of the range and keep me from not wanting to come in. I couldn't find a perfect opening, couldn't like get in on anything. There wasn't mistakes that she was making and in the fifth round I just decided, you know, you're going to have to, you're going to have to take the chance of getting knocked out. This is, this is what it's boiling down to now. You've got like three minutes left on the clock and now it's do or die. It's either you go in there you, you go for it, you do Russian, she catches you, you get knocked out, you know, you gave it everything you got or you got to make something happen. You finish the fight.

Speaker 1:          11:35          The question was really like whether the second round was a 10, eight round, uh, on all three judges score cards. It was, yeah, I mean watching it, that's what the judges said. Well it should have been but, but what I'm, what I meant was the question watching. It was like I want like when we were, when you were headed into the fifth round with my question was was I wonder if she got a ten eight round for that second round because if she did then this is like a, this is an even fight. So what's happening right now? Like what, where, how the judge is looking at it going into the fifth round. It was even, yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. That was such a crazy moment. Does another time. The, in doing the post fight interview were almost crying like a bitch.

Speaker 1:          12:15          I get so emotional. It was, it was incredible. He meets are hard to explain to someone when you're there and you, you um, you get to see someone like you who's worked so hard for something for so long, you know. So when I said to you like, how does that sound? Like what does it sound like? You're the new women's bantamweight champion of the world. Like what does that sound? And you were just so overwhelmed. It was so crazy. Like just to be right next to you while you were saying that and you said when you said, I'm waiting for you to say that for so long. It just crazy. It was crazy moment. It's crazy. Yeah. Cause I know what was, what's crazy a tie about the mind and the power of it. I've, I had visualized that moment so many times that it felt like I was confused in that it was hard for me to distinguish that that was the real moment I would go.

Speaker 1:          13:02          I would imagine it was so intense. It was so surreal. I would imagine my to this day it probably seems fake. Hat's really what it, yeah. Sometimes I have to go back and be like, man, that really did. It really happened. It really happened right there. Oh, it was topped Jay. Thank yeah, that excited. If you had like if Auras were real, you know like fucking, if you had ci it was coming off your body for sure. We did a photo falling over and been shaking papers, cups, foreign to the air and carpet would rip gracious moments in my life for sure. I could only imagine you could only am, I mean and anyone that watches that sport, that moment when you choked her out and in the whole exchange of the fee. Well even like that really the whole fight because a fight is like, I mean in a weird way, I mean we call this martial arts and there's a lot of people that have a problem with that.

Speaker 1:          14:02          But in my mind that there is an art to what you guys did in that fight. And even what holly did, because up until that fifth round, I mean, like you said, especially the third and fourth, she was doing what she wanted to do. She was, she was, and there was a display going on, there was like a, there was a performance going on, on top of this being a competition to watch it as someone sitting there watching it and calling it, I mean this is a work of art and to have it in that way, it was, it's such a masterful performance. It was such a masterpiece moment. And that to me is like one of the best moments in mma because it's such a fucking hard thing to achieve to become a champion. And for someone like you had tried and tried again, he won the title in strike force and you're trying and trying again and trying to make this happen and you know, you think you're getting boxed out and the Rhonda fight didn't happen after you beat Jessica I and then all of a sudden you have this opportunity and they comes to together in one of the most powerful ways we've ever seen inside the octagon.

Speaker 1:          15:02          It was amazing.

Speaker 2:          15:03          Well thank you. That was a, that was quite a great narration of everything that's had to happen to make this come true. You know? And it, it's, uh, it's crazy because, um, it was 10 the same month, 10 years, the like the month, um, that I had had my first fight. Wow. It's been 10 years. Yeah. So it's crazy because you think 10 years ago there wasn't even, I mean, women's MMA was a joke. Like it was, I mean, no one to me it wasn't obviously, but to, to most people it was a spectacle at best. Yeah. Something they kind of threw on the card is kind of like, ah, ha ha. You know, watch the chicks fight. You know, hopefully it'll pop out. You know, it's so true because they didn't respect us as athletes. You know? That's, that's what we, that's, that's the, that's the honest truth.

Speaker 2:          15:54          That's the uphill battle that it was like nobody took it seriously. We didn't make any money. We were fighting for breadcrumbs at best. I saw holly, um, once since densify and I was really actually kind of nervous about it because I was like, she was, um, at the Jones osp fight, those happen. And, um, we were both of the VIP party and my friend Heather Clark used to train heather. Joe Clark checks you fighting this weekend and Rotterdam. Anyways, she was like, you should go and talk to her. I was like, yeah, I want to, I just, I don't want to come off like, how, what do I say? What's up bitch? Yeah. Like what, what do you say to someone that you just, you knew took the dog, say hi. That's what I did. You know, I just went up and was like, you know, how are you?

Speaker 2:          16:33          And she like, she gave me, I was, she's like, you know, I'm just really bombed it in and get that rematch. And like, I know, I was like, don't worry. I was like, well, we'll see each other in the future. She's like, yeah. She's like, I hope so. I just like, I hope you still have it. It's like, you know, I wanna, I wanna, uh, you see you again in future. I'm like, yeah, I totally get it. I'm been in her shoes before. I know how bad that sucks. And she wants that back. But you know, we were friendly,

Speaker 1:          16:53          but it's amazing how both of you are so nice. Like holly's one of the nicest people. Nice. She's such a sweetheart. [inaudible] Nice. If you didn't know she was a fighter, he be like no fucking way. And then you find out she's a 19 time world boxing champion. Be like, what the fuck are you talking about? How's that possible? How's that Nice Lady? A a killer. Yeah. Some tomfoolery doesn't make any sense. Like, and she doesn't fit the mold either. Like both of you guys are really interesting representatives of MMA and great representatives because you break that mold.

Speaker 2:          17:21          You know a fan of her manager though. Oh yeah. Who is your why? I don't know. I don't even know if I've ever met him in person. I probably haven't. Maybe I have. If I did, it wasn't memorable. But anyways, um, I guess he went like Dana went down. So Tina Dana told me this, Dana went down to albuquerque before this fight ever came together of her and I, right. And he said, look, you guys need to wait for Rhonda. Trust me. That's the big money fight. That's a fight. You want to wait for it. He went down there. He told me, this is my face. He went down to tell them, don't fight me, tate, like they didn't want to give me the UC did not want that fight to happen. Right. They wanted, you know, the, the rematch to be the first fight. And Holly's manager told him, we want me Shantae and Dana said he threw up his hands and was like, are you fucking kidding me? He's like, she's been the baddest, you know, other than Ronda for years now. And you want to take her lightly. You think you're just gonna walk there? He's like, yeah, we got this. Like, she's going to be a tune up fight. Who's your manager? I don't even know his name. I don't know these 80 but he told Dana that, that they, that they thought that I was going to be a tune up fight.

Speaker 3:          18:27          [inaudible].
