Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Five, four, three, two,

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       And we're live. James, what's up? How are you man? I'm great. Don't freak out about your, your sound of your voice in the headphones. This is the first time you ever worn headphones or a podcast? Definitely the first time I've heard myself talk because it weird. After a second. Yeah. That's weird. You get over it. Be conscious about it. Really. You got to be all right. You take them off. You want. If it's freaking you out too much, you're going to get through this. Let's just take this bucket that we don't need these things. Just keep this sucker close to you. So, uh, first of all, thanks for doing this. You've been on this crazy sort of whirlwind tour. Have you gone anywhere or you just been doing it most from mostly from your house? Mostly from my house. Just on skype. Now for people who don't know the story, let's give them the short version of it. You were working at Google and what prompted you to write this memo?

Speaker 3:          00:01:03       Yeah. So they would have these company wide meetings where they just push a lot of this diversity stuff and some of it was kind of weird. So I decided to go to these, uh, these secret meetings, sort of that we're about 100 people a completely unrecorded and they would talk about some of the things that they're doing and it would really contradict what they're saying publicly where, oh no, we're not changing any of our hiring practices for these candidates. And they said, yeah, we basically are a making it easier for some kind of ways to get in. And I, you know, I voiced some concerns but people have just chain me and was like, no, you're wrong. You're just like, have white male privilege.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       I said, you have white male privilege. That was the actual word that he is. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:01:48       there is a lot of that going on. And so they asked for feedback on the program. So I, I wrote this document to clarify my thoughts. I sent it to them, they looked at it, but they just ignored it, never told me anything. So I went to a couple more of these programs and you know, I gave similar feedback, I gave the same document, they kept looking at it but just never said anything and you know, I would send it to random people that I knew and half the people will be like, yes, exactly. This is what I've been thinking. And the other half would maybe disagree with some points, but it would never be emotional outbursts or anything. It would just be like, oh, are you sure that this is actually happening? And it's like, yes, because, you know, I've actually been to these unrecorded meetings. This is what's happened.

Speaker 4:          00:02:34       So if you could get into specifics like when you're in these meetings and they're talking about diversity, what is their concern? And their, they're trying to promote an image of diversity. Are they trying to promote actual diversity? Uh, do they think that there's a benefit for diversity or is it a part of their public public image? And is it a lot of it to avoid criticism? Because I think there's a big issue with. I mean, if you don't have all your bases covered, two black women, two Asian men, if you don't have all your bases covered, you can get like pretty roundly criticized as not being diverse or being possibly racist when you do that, you're kind of fucked.

Speaker 3:          00:03:14       Yeah. So Google definitely has a huge target on its back and so there are people that want to complain that Oh, Google is not diverse, therefore it's racist and sexist. And so that's a lot of their fear that I look at their representation and then compare it to the overall us population and say, Oh, we only have 20 percent women. We should have 50 percent. There's obviously some sexism happening. And so a lot of their stuff is, oh, we need to fix this because you know, all this sexism is bad. And obviously if you disagree with sexism, that's of course bad. And like I obviously don't want there to be any sexism, but I just don't think that that's the sole cause of this disparity in representation.

Speaker 4:          00:04:01       Yeah. It seems like in the interest of promoting an image of diversity, they're willing to bypass science. And the truth and the reality of culture, the reality of human biology and evolutionary psychology, there's just so much that they're willing to look past to get to this one thing which seems to be like this really important thing today. Society that you want to promote an image of diversity. It's more important than anything. So like when you're in these classes or these, I mean, I wouldn't call it a class, what would you call it? A meeting, whatever they are.

Speaker 3:          00:04:37       Some of them are classes somewhere, you know, our day long programs teach you things like what would they teach you? They would talk about unconscious bias and no,

Speaker 4:          00:04:49       Oh, lucky you might be racist. You have to find the racism in you.

Speaker 3:          00:04:53       And yeah, there's a whole program that's trying to retrain your brain to think, to think about race in a new way or something.

Speaker 4:          00:05:01       So they're just assuming you're guilty

Speaker 3:          00:05:03       pretty much because someone. Because you're white. I. Well, yeah. I mean they look at the representation and say, racism, sexism.

Speaker 4:          00:05:11       Do a black people have to go to this?

Speaker 3:          00:05:15       I am. They know one has to have been asked to. They are definitely pushing it on people and uh, now managers are being evaluated by how well they promote diversity and inclusion and you know, it's just a slippery slope and I think it will eventually become part of our performance review.

Speaker 4:          00:05:34       So if you're a white woman, do you have to go to this? I mean, did that, are you encouraged to go to this? Are you like, Hey, you made it through like this will have been looking for your fine or if you're an Indian woman even better, right? Is that how it works or would you still have to go there and approach your unconscious biases?

Speaker 3:          00:05:52       Yeah, they say everyone has these unconscious bias

Speaker 4:          00:05:55       even towards white people. So do they have those

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       where they have like black people with their unconscious biases towards white people? So they never acknowledged that anyone could be racist against white people. Of course. Why would you. Yeah. It's all this. Like if you have, you can only be racist if you have power or sexist if you have power and they believe that the racist part. Yeah, I think so. Well that's insane. That's a redefinition. It's a very recent redefinition of the term racism, but it's very slippery, very dangerous because you could see it as, you know, promoting in fact like exonerating racism towards other ethnicities or towards white people were towards people that you feel like are in a privileged class. You'd get away with it because it's no big deal because they're the ones who are racist even if it's not even that person. If it's people who look like them that have lived for centuries, like somehow or another.

Speaker 5:          00:06:47       Your, a guilty person just with your white privilege. So like what would they tell you when you would go to these? Do you do, did you like express some discontent or. Yeah, I didn't. I, my main concern was them saying 50 percent in the population look who only has 20 percent. And so we're obviously women. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, there were clear reasons, at least in my mind that that's not as simple as they're making out to be and that there are some differences and that could explain some of the issues that women are facing. And so a lot of these women issues in tech. I feel are actually not really gender issues there. Just, uh, you know, women on average are more cooperative, for example, and so they may find it harder to, you know, lean in, in the corporate world like Sheryl Sandberg is saying, but you know, there are men that also feel like that I'm not very assertive.

Speaker 5:          00:07:50       I'm actually pretty shy and so I feel the same stuff and it's not that, you know, there's a ton of sexism. It's maybe that male typical behavior is rewarded just as competitiveness is rewarded in a lot of corporate world, but it's not that we're just, Oh, you're a woman, therefore you're obviously bad at coding, you know. No one has ever saying that. Right. I think there is absolutely an issue with assertive women being treated very differently than assertive men. Like an assertive woman is a bitch. Like you don't want to be around them. That's like the, the, the bias. And uh, that's a real issue I think for women that want to enter into any sort of a competitive field. And you know where a man would be assertive if a woman does the exact same thing she's looked down upon or looked upon like a problem woman or like someone you don't want to work with, whereas the guy is just ambitious yet, although some people will twist that and say that because I didn't, a lot of it is just they try to fit their ideology and they see one data point and they extrapolate so they see these studies and it's true that these women are viewed as less

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       likable, but they are seen as just as competent and so their performance reviewed isn't affected really by being assertive. It's just that socially they may not be as well.

Speaker 4:          00:09:07       Right. But then it's got to be a factor in the way they behave because for men, a ball busting successful man is supposed to be like looked up to like, oh, this is the guy who was kicking ass in the corporate world. He's doing it right. Like, you know, bob is ruthless. But if Jenny's ruthless, like you don't want to be around her, you know, it's a, it's a weird. It's just, that's, I feel like if there is a real bias with men who, obviously I don't work in tech, but I would assume that that would be a real bias.

Speaker 3:          00:09:35       Yeah, and I mean I think some of the solution to that is just allowing people to be more cooperative and you know, actually, so for example, a google, you're really rewarded for owning a particular project and seeing that one project go through, but if you're someone that is just, you know, can really help a lot of different people and you're not necessarily the sole owner of any individual thing, but you're, you provide a lot of value to the company that isn't really seen as positive as someone that really drove the project alone. That's interesting. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:10:11       that seems like a bad thing for teamwork, right? Is that just a bad philosophy or something that got stuck in the way the system works?

Speaker 3:          00:10:19       Sure. I think it's sorta just, it's hard to evaluate if I did, you know, 10 percent of my time on 10 different projects and I help them. That makes sense.

Speaker 4:          00:10:29       Yeah. So you'd have to essentially trust the workers instincts and work ethic and now the blow back from this has been very intriguing, you know, as an outsider looking at it from the. When I first heard about it, you know, I thought, well, this mean angry man must have written some things saying that women's suck at tech or they suck at this and you know, and people were reacting to this blatant misogynistic tribe that are ascribed that I, uh, was, was hearing about what, when I read it I was so confused because I was like, where's the mean stuff? Like where is this? And you also think that the other thing that was really confusing was it some people were reprinting it without citations. Did that freak you out? Like when you're being misrepresented?

Speaker 3:          00:11:15       Yeah. Especially when people would say, oh, it was so unscientific because it didn't have citations. And that was their entire argument. Who did it? Who printed it with outside citations? Because some major publications republished it yet I think it was Gizmodo or motherboard or something like, why the fuck would they do that without citations? That seems so unfair. Unreasonable and so irresponsible. I think a lot of these companies just have certain narrative that they're trying to push. Yeah. And so like even, you know, I've tried to talk to a lot of these reporters and I'll give hour long interviews with some of them and at the end they'll just write the same sort of article of like, Oh yeah, he's just a misogynist. And so I think even if I can convince the individual journalists, they are under pressure by their boss to write a certain type of article,

Speaker 4:          00:12:12       what a weird world we're in right now when it comes to that, because I was looking for something that could be,

Speaker 3:          00:12:20       could be like

Speaker 4:          00:12:22       evidence of massage. The only thing that I could find, and this is a very mild criticism, is that you were saying, I believe you used the term neurotic, that women were more likely to be neurotic. Neuroticism. Yeah. Yeah. That's one where a lot of women go, well fuck this guy. That's it. That's all. I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:12:43       what'd you base that on? Yes. So at there's the psychological big five personality traits and neuroticism is just one of them, right? That's the actual term that they use and it's sort of unfortunate that that's the term. Yeah. Yeah. It's that one. I feel like maybe you could have danced around that, but that's it. I think it's just I was too much into the, like I've seen the word so often that I didn't really associate it with neurotic and negative connotations.

Speaker 4:          00:13:17       Yeah. Well I've seen a bunch of your conversations. I've listened to you talk to Ben Shapiro and a couple other folks and uh, you know, your thought process is very reasonable and very wealth sorted out. And another thing that I'm not hearing from anybody is how you wrote a whole page and a half describing all the different ways that women could be more involved in tech or you can encourage more women to tackle like, this is not the work of a massage test. This is the work of someone who is carefully considering an issue and looking at it from a very. What I felt like, and correct me if I'm wrong, but that you felt frustrated that you were looking at something that was a, that people, the way they're approaching this wasn't. They weren't looking at it for what it was. They had kind of decided how they were going to describe it and how they were going to deal with it and it wasn't really based on facts or reality and certainly not on science and you sort of felt frustrated by this and you decided to try to interject with as much of the current science as you could that could possibly explain choices.

Speaker 4:          00:14:26       Not why women are bad at it. Not why were they, why they shouldn't be in it, which is what I kept reading, but more that why women choose to go into certain professions. What could be the impediment and what we could do to maybe encourage more women to do it. Instead of doing this sort of a blanket style diversity where you're just like, oh, we need two of these and we do two of those. Which is what I. I seem to think that they were doing. Is that, is that a good assessment? Yeah. By the way, this will never trend on youtube. You might get $5 million hits. It'll. I mean that's a real problem too. Like there's a lot of censorship when it comes to these sort of conversations. Like they would rather look at me who looks like a meathead and look at you and go, oh well these fucking guys are just talking shit about women for an hour. Right? I mean, do you feel that?

Speaker 3:          00:15:17       Definitely. And you'll be labeled right now

Speaker 4:          00:15:21       I've already been labeled. All right. Doesn't matter how many left wing positions I support. I look all right. Which is obviously like sexist, Short, misogynist, racist, all that stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:15:35       Well, but I mean just labeling us because we're white man or something. A certain label because it's.

Speaker 4:          00:15:42       Yeah, it's prejudice. I mean it really is, but people don't mind prejudices in that regard. You know, they only like, they don't, they have an issue with prejudices when it comes to what they feel like are disenfranchised or marginalized people. But white people, fuck them. You know, he can't, you know, that's the thought process, right? You can't be racist towards white people. So like what are the most egregious things like one of the most ridiculous things that they were trying to push when you were at these classes or meetings.

Speaker 3:          00:16:10       So I mean besides the fact of just certain things in our hiring process that would favor certain people which would create negative stereotypes for people just in general. So I, one thing about stereotypes that they don't realize is that people will automatically create stereotypes no matter what and it's based on their environment. So we see this with affirmative action to in academia where if you create a sort of situation where people have portions of the population are performing differently, then you'll automatically create the stereotype that Oh, maybe all the Asians are smart and all of the other minorities aren't as smart in this college. Right? Because you needed a 1600 to get in if you're Asian and you need lower otherwise. And so you'll automatically create that stereotype. And that's negative for everyone because you know, it creates this tension between the groups and they self segregate because of that, while if you just put everyone in the same level, then they'll just intermingle and it'll be great.

Speaker 3:          00:17:19       And so, you know, that has its negative consequences and it may be illegal, which is what I was trying to say in my document. So that aspect I think is bad. But then also, you know, once you think that, oh, all of this is because of sexism and even though we can't really see overt signs of sexism, like, Oh yeah, you're a woman, therefore you are bad and no one is saying these sexist slurs or then it must be some low level bias that we all have and that's why they're pushing all this unconscious bias and microaggressions and just increasing every one sensitivity to, oh you said something that could be interpreted in this one weird way and that might offend someone somewhere. Therefore you should never say anything. And it's really stifling. Well,

Speaker 4:          00:18:15       I think we would all agree that we would all be better off if we treated people nicer. If we, if we didn't have racism, if we didn't have sexism, we just appreciate it. People for their qualities and just could be very objective about that. Um, but when you're, I would imagine that when you're running a company as large as something like Google, you kind of have to put fires out before you even see smoke and like the writing's on the wall when it comes to criticism today and anything that, that people can point to when it, when it's, whether it's, um, a percentage of women, the percentage of minorities, whatever it is, where that they feel like is off. I mean, people will write articles about this. It can damage your stock profile, right? I mean it can, it can, like companies can take a hit on the stock market because of an article that someone could write about a lack of diversity. Like, oh Geez, they all lack of diversity. Like that's a real issue.

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       Yeah. And there have been reports of companies that'll have these diversity programs. And then blackmail companies, if they don't take them, so say you know, they'll start complaining because you know, all of these companies are the same and that they have about 20 to 30 percent women so they could do the same attack against anyone. And so they blackmail, accompany, say, Oh, you need to do these certain programs and if you don't then we'll start doing external pressure on you. So who are the companies that are blackmailing them for the groups? At least from what I've heard. And this is all secondhand. It's uh, a lot of the programs that. So they'll hire contractors to perform some of the diversity programs.

Speaker 4:          00:19:59       Oh. So they have like, sort of like Jesse Jackson, you should do with the rainbow coalition. You know, the story behind that. A little. This is the, uh, second secondhand story. But the second hand store was that he would go into these groups and uh, if anybody had said something, uh, whatever reason they had to get into this company, they would go into this company and then they would charge them a tremendous amount of money to go in and create these diversity programs. And if they didn't do that then they would shame the company and they will claim the company was racist. Know Jesse Jackson had like this laundry list of things you wanted, like jumbo shrimp cocktail and all this crazy shit and live I'll ride. But really like it's been kind of documented, you know, I mean I'd have to go back over it again. I remember it only barely, but the, I

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       mean that's where he got that moniker race pimp that will, he was essentially doing was race pimping and then he was going around and you know, kind of threatening people that we will call you a racist, we'll call your company racist, comply in this manner. And

Speaker 3:          00:21:05       that. That's scary. Yeah. And I mean I see that a lot at google. Not necessarily, you know, the same threatening, but just people feel that they have to walk on eggshells, otherwise they'll get reported to hr by some random activists within the company because you have activists in the company. Yeah. And you know, that was sort of made public, uh, you know, with all of this where there were some people that just really pushed and started complaining a ton based on my document. They would email my hr, everyone up my management chain and they'd write all these posts and try to coordinate people to really shamed me. And then they started tweeting about it after and that's how it leaked externally. Woo.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       What was the criticism of the memo? Like did anything make sense? Did anything make you go, hmm, I could have worded that better.

Speaker 3:          00:21:59       I obviously the neuroticism. Yeah. I, I could have worded that differently. I, I, the fact that I didn't talk about all the biases are that are against women as much, but it was really that this was in google internal document and so we already have so much stuff about the potential biases against women. And this was just the other side of the story, the other perspective that wasn't being heard. So yeah, I, I, I, I don't really know any criticism that was really. Oh yeah, that was definitely. I should have done that

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       man. I'm so how you would put this memo out there and then the memo got leaked and then once it got leak you got fired. Yeah. As soon after. But they knew about the memo already. Right. So. And they were cool with it. Like how long had the memo had been floating around? About a month. Wow. So as soon as it went public, like yikes. Get rid of them. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:23:06       It was, it seemed to just be a PR thing.

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       Of course. Yeah. But it's also a, it's weak, you know, and it's like, it's really disturbing that someone couldn't look at this for what it really is like this is an opportunity to have a discussion about the subject, you know what I mean? Here's this very detailed thing. If you guys disagree with it, let's debate it. Let's talk about it. Like I said, the only thing that I thought was even remotely derogatory was that one word or that one idea that women are more prone to neuroticism. Other than that, it just seemed to me to be evolutionary psychology. It seemed to be like a lot of stuff that has already been really well researched

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       and this is some pretty clear differences and again, it's not all women or all men, but there's a tremendous amount of evidence that shows that males lean towards certain professions and females lead towards other professions.

Speaker 3:          00:24:01       Yeah, and these are based on surveys of like half a million people, so people are saying, Oh yeah, this is just one study of the child is like, no, it's 90 different studies across many different countries and you know, there have been even experiments that length this to just prenatal testosterone. Yeah. Which is pretty strong evidence that there's some biological link.

Speaker 4:          00:24:22       We're all also, if you have a company like Google, which by the way, before we go any further, I'm a big fan of Google use their products all the time. I have a google phone. I mean, I think they're amazing. I think that browser is excellent. Uh, I like, I use chrome, I think they kick ass every morning. I go to my phone and I check the google news. I have a whole setup, but that's one of the first things I do. I check the news on my phone from Google, so it's not like I'm an google person, but

Speaker 3:          00:24:51       if, if

Speaker 4:          00:24:53       there wasn't some sort of evolutionary psychology reason or some sort of a prenatal testosterone reason or some biological reason why people were inclined to choose one profession over another, google would have to be a fucking horrible company. If everything was. Even if everybody was 50 slash 50 and they're only hiring 20 percent women, that means they're monsters. They're suppressing 30 percent of the weather. They're just like, fuck you, you can't work here. You can't get hired. You're just as good as us, but fuck off is a man's club. They would have to be monsters.

Speaker 3:          00:25:26       Yeah. And that's why I feel like some people are shaming me. Like, oh, this is such a bad thing to tell little girls that are interested in technology when really I think this is a much better view of the world where it just you, yeah. If you're interested in technology, great. There aren't as many women my queue, but if you are, that's amazing. While the other side of the story is, oh no, even if you are, then you'll find face all these challenges and it'll just be an uphill battle against sexism and you'll never be seen as good as a man and you know that's not very encouraging to a lot of people.

Speaker 4:          00:25:59       Well, it sounds so not. It's not necessarily accurate. You're kind of like bending the truth to meet your narrative. You know, where instead we should maybe look at what are the differences between men and women, but that's the thing people don't want to even accept. There's a trend today to not accept biological differences between the sexes, which is just fucking bananas. Like let's just not. Let's not accept the fact that water gets your wet. It's just weird. It's weird when people ignore truth to fit their ideology and when you're looking at like just sheer numbers of people, all you have is these numbers. I mean you could have a bunch of reasons why, but to say that the only reasons our implicit biases that the only reason this is some sort of discrimination against women, that's the only reason why they're not 50 slash 50. That's crazy. That means we're monsters, right? I mean, doesn't it mean more monsters? That means all men are monsters.

Speaker 3:          00:26:57       Yeah. When it's often the exact opposite, you know, we're very welcoming of women. We really want every woman that we can get and you, they'll even twist these studies that they have where they'll do these large analyses of, Oh, why did you leave tech? And it will be broken down by men and white men and it'll show a 30 percent of women felt like there was unfair treatment and harassment and then a one in 10 women felt like there was undue sexual attention to them and then the media will just report on that. But they don't see that 40 percent of men compared to 30 percent of women felt like there was a unfair trade, men or harassment and then one in 12 men felt like there was a, you know, unwanted sexual attention. So, you know, they completely disregard the other side of the narrative that, you know, it's not really a gender issue, that there's just unfair treatment in general, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:27:55       Well I think men are gross. I wouldn't want to work with them in an office. I mean if I was a woman I would think that would be the worst place to work because in an office with men, especially if I was attractive and it was just around a bunch of goons or staring at my butt and just saying stupid shit. Men are gross. I mean I think like generally is an issue with men and women working together because a lot of men are gross. You know? I mean it's not all of us obviously, but I mean just if I want to be honest about it, I would say that men, I think women probably have to deal with a lot of shit. But is that the reason why only 20 percent of them are in tech because that's not the case with all jobs where they work together and I think men are gross across the board. They're not just growth in tech. I mean they're probably grows like what our jobs were. Women are disproportionately represented. I'm like on the other side, like is it like a healthcare center?

Speaker 3:          00:28:45       Nursing veterinarians schools. So a lot of things that deal with people or animals in this case.

Speaker 4:          00:28:52       Yeah. Well I bet they deal with gross dudes there too here. But that doesn't stop them from being hired at a disproportionally favorable number percentage. Yeah. It's um, we got to look a, I think collectively. Here's one good thing. Here's the good thing about Google because I don't want to trash on Google. And the good thing about tech companies in general, I feel like we are in a way better position that tech companies are leaning way left. I think we're in a way better position socially that tech companies are being extremely concerned about diversity because you just don't feel that. And a lot of companies where they are about the hard line there about the bottom line, making money, kicking ass, taking names, pushing the company ahead. And they're, they're, they're about, you know, infinite growth. This is not what I see from tech companies.

Speaker 4:          00:29:44       What I see from tech companies is extreme caution when it comes to social issues and this extreme desire to be thought of as being very diverse, very fair, very liberal. I think that's good. I really do. I think it balances it out. And I also think when I think at least about the smartest people in the world or the most innovative people in the world today, I almost always think about tech because I think about like, well you look, if you looked at the human organism, you can look at the human organism, the human species as a whole. And if you looked at like what does it do that's most impressive? Well, what is does is his constant innovation and this constant desire to make things more and more efficient, faster, more capable that that's a big part of that is tech. So the people that are like in a lot of ways, at least the most technically creative, those people are oftentimes very left wing and very liberal. So I liked the fact that Google has this as a thought process. I just wish that it was unbiased in its determinations when it comes to biases. Does that make sense?

Speaker 3:          00:30:54       Yeah. So I agree that being progressive isn't necessarily a bad thing and you know, I, it is great that Google has this don't be evil motto and you know, they've decided, oh yeah, we get a ton of ad revenue, therefore we can do a ton of random stuff that's good for the world and shit. But you know, I think unfortunately there are political bias has created yet they've, they haven't forgotten their don't be evil motto. It's just that don't be evil has turned into just don't disagree with us and what our ideology says they got sloppy. Yeah, yeah. Well they're just a little off, but they're going the right way,

Speaker 4:          00:31:37       you know, and look, it's very difficult to fucking. I mean, how could you run a giant company like that and be just totally cool and above ground and have it all worked out? I mean, it just doesn't happen. You know, and especially when you have all these internal influences, like you're talking with these activists that work, that have, they have a vested interest in proving that there's racism, there's a vested interest, like when you go looking for a, uh, you know, if you have a hammer, everything becomes an issue, right? If you're a person who's the type of person that's looking for racism everywhere, fuck man. You're going to find it in all these weird places. So like that. Don't even make sense. Like these hidden unconscious biases where you have to examine yourself. Don't just look at overt actions and see whether or not those actions or racism. Yep. Racist. You have to actually examine all your thoughts and try to find racist thoughts and because they are in there, whether you want to believe it or not, right? Oh, Jesus isn't. God damn goes ton. You know, this is a witch hunt

Speaker 3:          00:32:35       [inaudible]. It's like, it's not. I like, again,

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       even though I'm a white man, I really feel like it's leaning better that we're shitting on white men. Then, you know, if it was the other way, if we were shitting on minorities, I mean it would be very disturbing if an enormous company like Google was going, well let's just, let's be honest. Puerto Ricans are lazy. Know, like, Whoa, but if a company comes along like Google, it's like, well, you know, white, you can't be racist towards white people. Like, okay, like least we can work here. We could talk, we can talk about this, but this is, you're saying something fucking crazy racist. I know you don't think it's crazy and racist because you're trying so hard to not be racist towards minorities that you're looking at what's a temporary majority? I mean white people only majority for another decade. Right? You know, I hope it evens out, but I feel like in defense of Google, it's better to be leaning incorrectly in that direction

Speaker 5:          00:33:34       than to go the other way. Yeah, I mean, I think it's fine to have a leaning. It's just you need to not be blind to the other side and I think that that's what's happening right now. Yeah. Where you know, they're completely shutting down the conversation and they're really making certain employees feel completely alienated. Well, yeah. It seems like you can't, obviously you tried to talk about it and you were fired. Yeah. No, I mean you were, you were shamed for a little while and then it went public and then you were fired. Now why did, did they do, did they send it publicly because they knew that people would have a negative reaction towards it? That's what I think. Yeah. I didn't know who did it. It was probably the people that were tweeting about it and saying that I was just a massage and it's Nazi person.

Speaker 5:          00:34:18       I don't see. Yeah, I definitely used white supremacists. Nazi was used. Yeah. They just keep escalating and at some point I don't really know it'll happen. You know, white supremacists is now being used for a lot of things. You're a white supremacist somehow. Wow. And at some point people will just see no, these people aren't actually that and you know, they've just create a bubble of words that they say and it just keeps getting more and more extreme and at some point it'll just shatter like an economic bubble, but I, but that's very dangerous because it opens a door to competition to google, like someone who is more rational. And I think that's unfortunate for google to like to be supporting these ridiculous ideas. Like I've read this one article with this woman was calling you a misogynist and uh, it was like a, she was

Speaker 4:          00:35:10       being really brutal, but it was, it was a total false narrative because I was listening, I was reading it and I was trying to, like, I'd read your memo. So I read your memo and then I read this article about your memo. I'm like, this is like an angry person that has just decided that this is the focus of all the woes of the world is James and I'm going to shit on James and the massages the world. Like James are the reason why women can't excel in tech.

Speaker 3:          00:35:42       Yeah. And I think part of that is that there's just an asymmetry, so there's no punishment for writing this really angry letter that says how misogynist I am, even though that's a negative to me and anyone else that has similar viewpoints. So there really needs to be some sort of retribution maybe for people that just so openly are so negative,

Speaker 4:          00:36:05       you could just get away with it. Yeah. And then no one questions it. It's not open for debate. That's really part of the problem. It's like people are so looking for things to be racist that when someone cries racism, if you debate it at all, like, well how is he racist? Like you become a Nazi for like discussing things. Even if you, even if you just objective go over the facts and don't agree with their assessment, you become a racist.

Speaker 3:          00:36:34       Yeah. And you know, even if you don't say anything that's overtly racist, they'll say, oh yeah, that's just dog whistling and Oh yeah, you can tell what he meant when he said

Speaker 4:          00:36:44       sad. The could see it in his eyes. This is I, this is not hyperbole what I'm going to say. But this is real. This is how mccarthyism got started. This is how it got started. Everyone was looking for communists and every. You couldn't even explore what communism was like. You couldn't be confused. Like if I read a book today, like I've got a book over there by Michael Malice on North Korea. If I read a book on North Korea like, well what's what's going on in North Korea? People wouldn't be like Joe Rogan's a North Korean supporter. He wants to move to North Korea. He wants us all to be under a communist dictatorship wrong by Kim Jong Moon. He was like, you wouldn't say that, right? Well, back then you would. Back then during the mccarthy era, it gives you started reading like communist newsletters or you started going to a meeting, like what?

Speaker 4:          00:37:35       What is this all about? You could get shamed run out of Hollywood, and it was a giant issue and people were ratting on people and they were doing it for the same reasons. They did not want to be lumped in with this group, so they would immediately turn people down. They were turning in. Their neighbors were like scary time where people were looking for the communists. Everybody's looking for the dirty red scare, you know, they're going to come and infiltrate our world. It's very similar because it's, it's a mindset, this, uh, um, this mindset of not looking at things objectively but having everything boxed into these very convenient packages and this is one of them, that diversity is of the utmost importance and that anything that does not challenge that idea or anything that does not support that idea rather is racist.

Speaker 3:          00:38:23       Yeah. And that was sort of what I was trying to say when I said demoralized diversity because, you know, we've just put on such a pedestal and we've stopped looking at the costs and benefits of it and we've just started looking for villains, you know, all the racists and we just want to punish those villains and an label. Anyone that disagrees with any of the precepts of diversity as some sort of evil person.

Speaker 4:          00:38:48       Well, it just sort of foolish approach, especially the approach of making Asian people get higher scores that is so racist. Like, yeah, they study harder and do better. What's the reason? I don't know, whatever the reason is they do it. I mean, is it cultural? Probably. Is it a biological. I don't know what, but whatever reason it is the correct response that is not make Asians get higher scores. That's fucking insane. Super Racist. You know? I mean how racist is that? That's crazy. Like why are they. I mean and there are minority which is even weirder, but it's somehow or another that one is like we let that one slide because we know they, they don't complain and they kick ass and they'd go and study hard. So for some reason we like let that one slip.

Speaker 3:          00:39:35       Yeah. And a lot of this has some really nefarious history were the beginnings of just, you know, we used to just have tests and then that would be how you got into Harvard for example, and whoever has the highest score we get in, but then they saw, oh there's too many Jewish people getting in. And so they started adding all this, oh, let's look at your extra curriculars and let's make it more subjective on who we get in and that, that way they could discriminate against Jewish people. Really. So that's how it started. Yeah. And this was like early 1900.

Speaker 4:          00:40:11       Wow. Wow. Well yeah, there's another one. There's a, there's a disproportion amount of European Jews that are Nobel prize winners. Right? Why? Well, they're fucking smart. Like what? What does, what does that mean? Does that mean that we're, we're prejudice against Irish people know what does it mean? Well, what it, whatever it means. The end result is what's significant. We're not stopping other people from taking these tests. Right. If you get a disproportion amount, portion amount of European Jews, there should be some sort of study in. There has been. But there should be some sort of studies as to what is it culturally like, what is it? What is the significance? Like what, what has happened in the past that led this one group of people to be extraordinary, successful, extraordinarily successful in one area. Well that's what we should study. We should try to keep Jewish people out. That's fucking insane. And it's racist and I think Asian people are not complaining the same way other folks would know with the same exact issue. You know? I mean, it's essentially a reverse affirmative action sort of a situation. Really Weird.

Speaker 3:          00:41:19       Yeah. It's unfortunate. I mean, especially since many of these are just first generation immigrants, they don't feel like they necessarily have the power to really stand up to some of this.

Speaker 4:          00:41:31       Do you, uh, have any very Asian friends? Have you ever been around like really strict Asian households?

Speaker 3:          00:41:36       Yeah, the culture is definitely different and there is a higher priority on school and more traditional values.

Speaker 4:          00:41:43       I had a good buddy of mine when I was young who was Korean and he was in medical school and his parents were Burger udl. I mean they just wanted a's across the board. No fucking excuses. You will study until your hands bleed and you know, there was just this sort of culture of success in that household and have work hard work and hard work ethic. And you know, the family's idea was like, look, we came over to America from South Korea so that you could kick ass, period. You're not going to come over here and fuck off. And obviously he was a fucking straight a student and a, just a wizard. I mean this dude was just always awesome at everything and always working really hard. But he was completely stressed out all the time and everything. And he's like, but just getting everything done. But I mean it's the culture that he grew up in. So to discriminate against that guy and say, well you work too hard. Yeah, junk shit. You can't, you know, you know, your scores are a little bit too high. You don't like it. So we're gonna we're gonna need a higher threshold for you. That's racist.

Speaker 3:          00:42:50       Yeah. And there's nothing that they can do. You can't work harder and know.

Speaker 4:          00:42:56       No, it's stupid. It's like saying to athletes like certain athletes so, well, you know, you've been training too hard and so we're going to need a faster 40 yard dash from you than a regular person to get on the team. He would never say that. You would say, well, this guy is obviously super dedicated and gifted. This is the guy we want our team. And that's the one thing where I feel like we don't see a lot of this stuff. You know, uh, we, we like results when it comes to athletics. When it comes to things like, what's your number? Like, what is the fastest you can run? What is, how high can you jump? What's the pole vault that you do, you know, how far do you throw a disc? Is all those things like very clear, very clear numbers. You can't, you can do that sort of same sort of approach that you're dealing with academics or with industry. You can't do that approach. When it comes to athletics, [inaudible], it's, I mean, I'm not suggesting that the whole world is a sport, but I mean when, when it comes to things like scores and keeping people out and letting people in and trying to push to get more people of a certain color ethnicity and like you're, you know, doing some slippery work, man, you know that it gets real weird when you start doing that.

Speaker 3:          00:44:09       Yeah, I, it's all about leveling the outcomes of people and yet I think there's this scary, a Kurt vonnegut short story where if you're a really smart, then you'll have to wear headphones that just beep all the time. If you're a beautiful, you'll have to wear a mask in the future if you're strong and you'll have to have all of these weights on you. You know, it's

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       sort of getting there. It's the same sort of ideology and it's scary. Well, life is not fair, right? It is just not. No one wants to hear that and this is really the core issue for all of this stuff. Life is not fair. There are people that are so much fucking smarter than me when I talked to them, I feel like some sort of a monkey, you know, just just, there's no getting around that. There are people that are so much bigger than me, but then I stand next to them. I feel like a child, you know, there's just no getting around that, that that's just the way of the world and I think the key is, I mean, I guess with a company is to try to figure out how to manage all of these unfair aspects of being a biological entity and the civilization.

Speaker 5:          00:45:18       And I don't think Google is doing the right job by firing you for promoting science because that's what you're doing. You know, I had a friend who actually was comparing what you did to, what's that term friend knology when you study the size of people's heads. When they got there. And I was like, man, you can't say that. It's not what he's doing. He's doing because he's not saying that women can't do it. He's not saying they wouldn't be better at it. He's simply using science and citations to describe many of the issues that probably led to people choosing what they choose to do for a career. Right. But you can't do that, man. Look, look at you. You're here. You're everywhere. You're talking about this. Yeah. I mean hopefully people will start seeing that at least how much the media was misrepresenting it. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:46:05       Did you feel frustrated by all these articles? I mean, it's got to be weird to have people call you a white supremacist and a Nazi and. Yeah, and they also try to dig up any dirt that they can find on my history and stuff. Way Back in high school that I might've done tomb raider it as war Croft. He was a girl running big tits. Did they find anything? Not really. Damn, dude. What if you had like some dark secret? Yeah. That's the thing. Like I could have done some random thing that was bad of course, but I mean that wouldn't change the fact that what I wrote wasn't the sexist thing. Right. If you did something horrible in the past, at least people can go, oh, okay, maybe this guy's a bullshit artist, and he leaned this stuff toward sexism even though there is some science behind it.

Speaker 5:          00:46:55       What he wrote was biased, but I haven't seen a legit criticism of the actual work itself. I really haven't. I've, I've read a lot of stuff on you, man. It's a little creepy. I haven't seen anything that made sense. Everything that was criticizing, criticizing you was being really dishonest. Yeah. It was either just, Oh yeah, this is obviously misogynist, or they would attack claims that I didn't make. They were like, Oh yeah, we've shown that women are better in school and are doing better in math. Yeah. It's like, okay, I wasn't talking about that at all. Yeah. It does nothing to do with career paths, you know? Um, was really fascinating to

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       me that the woman who's the CEO of Youtube responded and said it hurt her and she read your memo and I'm like, you're the CEO of Youtube. You won. You're the winner of winters when it comes to ut, like you're the head of tech, like no one's saying you don't exist saying you can't do it. You obviously did it. You're a fucking running the thing. This is crazy. Why did it hurt? Science hurts. What hurts? Like, look, there are, there's, there's outliers, right? There's always going to be interesting to find out why straight white males choose different career paths. Like why? I mean, there's so much variation. There's so much. So many variables. There's so much difference. There's people that are um, you know, there's women that are mma fighters. Like why? Why are they doing that? Like, what is it? I don't know. Like there's, there's women that are race car drivers. There's like, there's outliers. Does that mean that we need a exact representation of males to females in mma? Well, that's insane. That's not going to happen. For whatever reason. Is that the state with that Nascar, it's not going to happen. There's not some implicit bias. It's keeping women from driving 250 miles an hour. I don't know what it is, but I don't think that's it. I think there's probably some biological differences between men and women and they vary. There's a spectrum,

Speaker 3:          00:48:50       you know, for Nascar it's likely, you know, risk aversion. Yeah. And some stuff related to that. Same with MMA. Sure. Yeah. I mean I wouldn't want.

Speaker 4:          00:49:00       Yeah, I mean look at it and I want to do it, you know, and I know a lot of pretty girls that are doing it. It's very weird. So it's, look there's people make choices, you know, some people choose to get their bodies tattooed, some people choose to do all sorts of strange things, you know, it's, I don't know why they do what they do, but it's interesting to study them and it seems to me that all you were doing was talking about your own personal frustration with this very narrow minded approach to diversity.

Speaker 3:          00:49:31       Right. And you know, they never even say what exactly I could have done differently to not do this. And you know, there was actually a great piece in the Atlantic or something that was directed at Sundar is like, okay, what specific parts of the document we're against the code of conduct and what parts are free to discuss and what are not. Because right now you can't discuss anything, you know, he just said, Oh yeah, this document is invalid. And so it means that no one can bring up any of these issues now. And just they just have to walk on these really vague eggshells when really if they said no, this specific part is unacceptable and everything else is fine, then at least there will be some wiggle room and people would know what the rules are. But. And we see this a lot with Google policy where they had these like no jerk policies and no jerk. Yeah. Like don't be a jerk. Okay. And were jerk is totally up to them to define. And so there could be these people that just, you know, harassed you based on your white male privilege and you know, oh you're conservative, therefore you're evil and that's not being a jerk. But then, you know, questioning some of their viewpoints and the narrative at Google that it's being a jerk.

Speaker 4:          00:50:48       So white people are open game essentially. Like if someone is questioning you about something and you happen to be a white person, they got to get away with far more.

Speaker 3:          00:50:59       Yeah. They try to invoke this a lot too in these programs where you're encouraged when you ask a question or something you say as a white male, this is what I feel. Oh Jesus. And that. I just think that that's really specific as well.

Speaker 4:          00:51:16       White male with a fat Dick and a large pornography collection on a hard drive. That's how feel like

Speaker 3:          00:51:23       what? No, I think even mentioning pornography would be some sort of microaggression and that's a major aggression, right? Sexual harassment.

Speaker 4:          00:51:33       Yeah. You were a. They cited that you promoted harmful gender stereotypes. Right. So I had to go over it again. I'm like, okay, let's read this fucking thing one more time. Like I don't. I don't think you've promoted any stereotypes. You were talking with citations about science and that's, that's where this whole thing really confused the shit out of me. What have you had many people like what is the, the, has there been like a 50 slash 50 sort of reaction, like 50 percent of the people were like me kind of confused about this and, and then 50 percent of the people were just knee jerk calling you some sort of a sec. A sexist or a Nazi.

Speaker 3:          00:52:11       Yeah. So at Google they had an internal poll with about 800 people and about 40 percent of people agreed. And 40 percent. Yeah. Fifty percent disagree with 10 percent were neutral.

Speaker 4:          00:52:21       Yeah. Cowards. And even the 50 percent, probably a good percentage of them are just being pussies. It just doesn't. It doesn't seem like if you're looking at it really objectively, you could look that they obviously want a result and that result is the maximum amount of diversity. And I feel like if that's your result, if that's what you're looking for, shouldn't the result be let's not discriminate, just be open and just try to get the best people. Like wouldn't that be the best way to do it? And then if we run into problems like, you know, we've tried to do this best people thing, but all we have as Asians, so, uh, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:53:01       So even suggesting that we should go to selling meritocracy thing. That's a microaggression. Meritocracy is a microaggression. Yeah. Yeah. So what's the argument for that? Like why is meritocracy a microaggression? Because it will make some people feel unwelcome because they have to perform. I really, it's basically just anything against the last ideology is a microaggression in some ways. So anything that could make anyone feel offended, particularly people in certain groups.

Speaker 4:          00:53:37       Man, that's an liberal for a long time. And I've never seen it this bad before. You don't know what happened when it happened. So slippery it seems like within the last 10 years, right?

Speaker 3:          00:53:49       Yeah. I think the Internet has celebrated a lot of this where there can be these online mobs that enforced these social rules, but I, I think at least now some people can see it for what it is. Well, I think

Speaker 4:          00:54:03       what you're seeing is that there's a fear of retribution and that's one of the reasons why people are towing the line is that they're worried about these, like hyper aggressive people that are coming out against people that don't toe the line there, you know, like you're saying shaming you and that that is, that's a disturbing aspect of human nature that I don't think she'd ever be reinforced. And, and, and I think it's hard to call those things out individually because of collectively as a group, if this group of diversity minded folks left wing minded social justice warrior types are attacking you, you feel very isolated and there's not a lot of support, you know? And so most people just acquiesced they just back off, they just give in, they toe the line, they alter their thoughts or they keep it to themselves.

Speaker 3:          00:54:54       Yeah. And I mean I think shaming does have its benefits it and when we were in small groups, you know, if someone stole something or was mean, Dan actually shaming them as good. But you're talking about tribal groups in the past. Yeah. But now that anyone across the world can just randomly shame you and attack you, that does not really what our brain was meant for and just, you know, even me seeing just random messages telling me that I'm some horrible person that, you know, that hurts me even though I have gotten a lot of actual private messages saying, yeah, we support you. You're not alone, but I have to keep my mouth shut. I don't want to get fired from Yahoo. Right. I've met with so many people and they're like. And of course, you know, don't tell anyone that you. That's so weird. Now you obviously we're not a public person, right? You were a guy just was working. What is your job at Google? A software engineer. I was working on the indexing and serving of a search.

Speaker 4:          00:55:59       So to go from that, which is, I'm like you, you describe yourself as an introvert, right? And to go from that to this massive exposure and to be the essentially the lightning rod for a real hot topic. I mean this is one of the most hot button topics you can get. Men versus women in tech are men and women in tech, women, diversity, white people, black people, racism. Nazis who you're, you're at the tip of the spear buddy.

Speaker 3:          00:56:30       Yeah, and I'm really afraid that I'm actually just polarizing issue even more and separating people and because you know, it's really shown that there are the stereotypes are real and some ways that there are some really extreme people on the left and really extreme people in the right maybe and you know, we really need to bridge it and say, okay, let's actually have a discussion, let's talk about what's actually happening and nothing is really off the table in this discussion, but that's not happening. And Google itself, from what I've heard, they've just been doubling down on the diversity stuff and they haven't addressed any of the political discrimination.

Speaker 4:          00:57:13       Wow. Well I think you're right and I think that's. That has to be your motivation for writing that thing. I mean, that was a very well thought out memo and I don't think someone who wanted to separate people would have written that the way it seemed to me as an outsider with no dog in the fight. I was looking. I was like, Oh, this guy is probably like frustrated at what he sees, these sort of social justice warrior tactics and these aren't logical and that this is not rational, and like maybe my breakdown of this situation scientifically evolutionary psychology studies and all these different random factors that may have contributed to women choosing these careers. Maybe this will help ease off. Maybe people aren't aware of this information.

Speaker 3:          00:58:03       Yeah. Yeah. I definitely have a bias where I thought we could just sit down and discuss it rationally. That's all I ever wanted was sit down and discuss it with them. Yeah. But I really underestimated the sort of group based emotions that were behind this and that's scary.

Speaker 4:          00:58:22       Yeah. Well, you know, they're fucking. One of the things that was important about Charlotte, I think Charlottesville rather, is that we got to see real Nazis, right? Like, hey man, they're real. It's not the fucking guy, right in the Google memo, it's this asshole with a swastika on his chest is carry a Tiki torch walking down the street with a gun in his pocket. You know, ranting about the Jews and black people. That's a real Nazi and that is what you were saying. There's extreme people on the right and there's extreme people on the left and they they. They don't understand that they are way more similar than they like to believe. If you believe that all white people are racist, if you believe that is an MPO is impossible for you to be a white person and not have some implicit bias and racism and that it's impossible to be racist against white people because racism is about using power and influence and minorities do not have power and influence, so they can be prejudice, but they cannot be racist.

Speaker 4:          00:59:25       Well, you're just as bad as the fucking person with the Tiki torch. You don't think you are. I know you don't think you are, but you want because you're just as ridiculous. You're so off of what is real. You're so off. You know the idea that all black people responsible for the woes of society and that none of it has to do with the fact that were captured hundreds of years ago and brought over here as slaves and that there there are lesser as human beings. That's a disgusting, ridiculous proposition and the people that think that way are fools, right? And that rightly so, most people in the center look at those as fools. I look at the people that think that you can't be racist against white people as just as foolish. You dumb fucks are fueling these assholes like with this dumb way of looking at things and pushing these ridiculous ideas that all white people are racist.

Speaker 4:          01:00:13       You're supposed to feel bad because you're white. I didn't do anything. Didn't do anything, didn't ask to be born white, didn't ask to be born male. Okay? Like you can't get mad at people for who they are. You should. We should be having an open discussion about what is wrong, like what's wrong? Like how, what, what, what is going wrong? Why is this happening? Why are these negative things happening? Not why don't we have more women or why don't we have more Indian men are. Why don't we. I mean, that's, that's fucking ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          01:00:48       Yeah, it's crazy. And I didn't. The two sides are just scapegoating, so it is very similar and not taking any personal responsibility. At least, you know, what Jordan Peterson would say is just, you know, fix yourself before trying to fix the ills of the world.

Speaker 4:          01:01:03       Well, I mean I think there's also an issue here is that I don't, I've got to be very careful with my words, but I feel like this is a game and I don't mean it's a game. Like there's not, it's not a real issue. This app, it's absolutely a real issue, but I think people play for points and I think that there's a real issue when people do things for Social Brownie points, right? Like Google saying that you were fired for promoting unfair gender stereotypes or dangerous or what was the word that they use? Harmful, harmful, harmful gender stereotypes. That is a fucking play. That's a play for points. One hundred percent. Okay. Where are the fucking harmful gender stereotypes? Where are they promoted? You tell me how. If you don't tell me how I want a fucking apology because you're lying. You're lying because you want all those people on the left. It calmed down. Well, we fired him. I fired him a month after you. You knew he wrote that Shit. Are you guys crazy? Did you go over the science before you fire them or. No. Like what did you, what did you do? Like where's the, where's the harmful gender stereotypes you guys talked about?

Speaker 3:          01:02:10       Yeah, and I, it sucks too because you really need to address some of these things if you want to address the gender gap. And yeah, that was what page of my thing was all about was oh, you know, if women are more cooperative and they approach the workplace differently than maybe we can change our workplace to be more approachable. But if they're not willing to acknowledge any of these differences then you know, they won't do anything. So it's really annoying.

Speaker 4:          01:02:39       Well, any interpersonal relationships with random people can be messy. You know, you get a group of 30 people together, you force them to work in a building and it's going to be messy to where people are messy. We're weird, you know, and if you have more of one group than another, that groves is going to fail. It alienated. So if you have 80 percent men, 20 percent women, they're going to feel alienated. There's no way around it. But the right way of approaching it is not to distort the facts, especially when you're thought of as being. I mean Google is essentially a pillar of information. I mean they're one of the most important like hey man, google it. I mean that is the thing that people say they're one of the most important aspects of our society today. Having the ability to instant nobody says go bing that nobody gives a shit about being right.

Speaker 4:          01:03:29       I mean as a joke, but Google is hugely important. So if you are essentially in charge of the distribution, have more knowledge than arguably anything else on earth. Maybe that's a big statement, but I think. I think you might be able to. You might be able to actually say that and be empty. Pretty honest. I think Google is responsible for distributing more information than any group on earth. That's a giant responsibility. That responsibility. You cannot say that someone is promoting harmful gender stereotypes when they're absolutely not, because I'm going over this fucking thing. I'm pulling pages out. I'm like, where's the harmful gender stereotypes other than the word neuroticism. I just don't. If you got fired for the word neuroticism, well why is that word in all of these evolutionary psychology texts? Like what? What's going on?

Speaker 3:          01:04:26       Yeah, and if you just google personality differences between men and women or something, then that'll be the first five results. So it's. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:04:35       and obviously these are just some of them. I mean there's a broad. Again, there's a broad spectrum of human beings and both genders, right? Who are you suing them?

Speaker 3:          01:04:45       Yeah, exploring all legal remedies. That's. Have they contacted you and go, listen,

Speaker 4:          01:04:51       James will have to be so crazy. James relaxed. Let's go to dinner. Let's have some falafel.

Speaker 3:          01:04:59       I am surprised that they never know when they fired me had me try to sign something to say, Oh yeah, you know, just here's some nondisclosure agreement or something and then just pay you off. Yeah. But that was a big fuck up on their part. It seems like it. Well, I think they feel like they're completely.

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       I feel like the game again is like super clear. Like oh no, we just, we sunk a three pointer in. It's no problem. Like this is pretty. This is pretty straightforward. One of the net dude, we don't have to do shit. You have to pay him because he lost the point, you know, and I think maybe they underestimated how much negative press there would be about this because a lot of the initial stuff was all negative because it was coming out of the people that were tweeting about it and then they saw that, oh yeah, the, it's really not this one sided and you know, a lot of the things that may happen in a case as you know, there's a lot of discovery into what the internals of Google are happening. I don't think they want that to happen because you will actually see that, Oh yes, maybe there was this illegal discrimination happening.

Speaker 5:          01:06:06       Now what is illegal about the discrimination that they're employing? So I didn't and I'm not a lawyer, so I can't say, but at least according to our own policies we said, you know, it's illegal to use someone's protected status, so their sex or gender or sex or race and employment, critical situations like, you know, when they're getting hired, when they're trying to be matched to a manager or to a team and when we're choosing who to promote and. But it, it is happening in a lot of these places. Protected status. Yeah. That's how they refer to it internally. Or is that like a common phrase? I think that's a common phrase. Well protected step. What's protected about like, yeah, you're not supposed to be able to discriminate on based on someone's age or you know, I mean it's mostly, it was originally like, oh yeah, you shouldn't be discriminated against black people, but obviously, I mean it should apply to everyone.

Speaker 5:          01:07:04       Right? So by doing that, they violated their own rules. Right. But they don't think about it that way because they're promoting diversity by doing that. Yet it's kind of weird how they cited some of the same parts of the code of conduct where. Oh yes, every employee should do their utmost of reducing bias and harassment and illegal discrimination. When really my document was about eliminating the bias against conservatives and the harassment against them and the legal discrimination that we're doing in multiple parts of our pipeline. There's no room for conservatives today or. I mean I'm. Are you conservative? Do you feel like you can tell I'm pretty much just libertarian, but that's thought of as conservative because it's convenient. You just immediately pushed off. Yeah. That right wing, angry white male group. Everyone that's in the center or right of that is alright. Alright. Yeah, it's pretty. You favor of smaller government, less intrusion. Yeah. I'm not super libertarian.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       Like I obviously believe that there's places where the government should be, but just my, my like internal leaning or in philosophy is more like the.

Speaker 4:          01:08:26       Yeah, I think socially I lean more left like socially, like in terms of like welfare and things along those lines and you know, obviously this protected status is driving me crazy. This, this thing that trump's doing with um, uh, children that were born in this country are born in other countries and then brought over here as children and then they're talking about deporting them. That drives me fucking crazy. The hard right version of that is despicable. This, these people that I see online with, why didn't they apply for citizenship? Oh, who knows? Maybe because they're fucking 13, you know, like will you out there applying for citizenship if you were 13? No, I mean when you're 13 years old you're playing games and hanging out with your friends and then you find out you were born in Guatemala and you're like, what? Like you have to go back to Guatemala.

Speaker 4:          01:09:11       What? Yeah, it's crazy sex. I lean way left when it comes to those kinds of things. Gay Rights and things like, um, you know, uh, social programs for disenfranchised people and disenfranchised communities. I leaned way like if I want my tax dollars to go to anything I wanted to go to, making people's lives easier, whether it's socialized medicine or whatever, whatever we could do to make people have an easier path to success and to not have them so burdened down by their environment and their circumstances. That I think is like our responsibility as human beings to try to, I don't want to say even the playing field because there's never going to be an even playing field, but to give people opportunity, that's it. Just give people an opportunity to do well, not have it so completely stacked against them. So in that sense, I'm not very conservative in that way.

Speaker 4:          01:10:03       Like I'm not one of those pull yourself up by your bootstraps that because that's just, that's so delusional. Like some people are just fucked, you know, they, they, they're born with a terrible hand and it would be nice if more of us were charitable in that regard. You know? And some people think that that charity should be a personal issue and that we should all just do it, you know, as part of our community and our society. Maybe that's a good argument. And, but maybe the argument is that our government should be a part of our community, you know, and that we should think about it that way instead of thinking of it as, as, as this overlord that decides and designates where our money should go, that maybe we should have some more say in it, it should be some sort of a, a more, um, you know, just, just a, a more, uh, more kind approach. So in that sense, I leaned pretty far left, but I'm also pretty pragmatic, you know, and I, and I also know that if you give people too much, it's sort of that winning lottery ticket thing or that you know, that if you, if you make things too easy for people, they don't try hard. It's just a natural part of human nature. So in that sense, some conservative

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       and a lot of ways, yeah, you definitely need some sort of safety net and to ensure that people can actually achieve the American dream.

Speaker 4:          01:11:21       Well just be healthy, make our live and bleeding more and more towards the universal basic income than anything. I think universal basic income at a certain point to elegant enough that you can just eat and survive and then maybe that would open up a lot more people to pursuing dreams to going after things. I mean,

Speaker 5:          01:11:38       I don't know. I mean there's arguments for and against and I think it's debatable. It will be interesting to see know Finland I think was proposing to start this because we don't really know what will happen. Right? And maybe people will start doing their hobbies and really find their passion. Maybe they'll just sit at home and watch TV and die. Yeah, I, it's really. These are the problems that we as a society will have to overcome. And you know, of course these are just first world problems, but that's, that will be what the world is like. There was another country today. I read about it on Google a, another country today that's considering universal basic income. Fucking was it South Korea? Oh really?

Speaker 6:          01:12:25       Um,

Speaker 5:          01:12:26       see if he could find it. It's in Scotland. Is that what it was?

Speaker 6:          01:12:31       Oh,

Speaker 4:          01:12:34       I think there's many, many people that are. I mean, Elon Musk has been promoting this lately. Scotland will begin funding universal basic income experiments. Yeah, Hawaii, that's what it was. Hawaii considers universal basic income as robot scene, stealing jobs. Fucking robots running around the streets. Stealing jobs. Yeah. It's Hawaii

Speaker 5:          01:12:55       I think are,

Speaker 4:          01:12:57       is, uh, some real arguments to be made. And I think, um, Elon musk who is of course a part of this automated a car revolution and he's, uh, he's creating these, these trucks that they're gonna start using to haul things and they're going to be automated and it's going to remove a lot of jobs and they're starting to talk about universal basic income as you know, a real solution to that mean

Speaker 5:          01:13:24       it's entirely possible. It's certainly an argument, you know, it's certainly worth discussing yet, something like that. And hopefully the incentives will be better than some of the current welfare systems where you know, you're not incentivized to get off of it. Yeah. If you start working then you'll lose all of it while universal basic income can be made such that you start working and then you'll lose a little bit. But it's never an actual incentive to not work. Yes. Right. It's not an incentive to not work, but it's an,

Speaker 4:          01:13:56       it gives you food and shelter. Right. So then you could go pursue a dream, which I think it would be wonderful. I mean, look, if there's anything that our tax dollars should be going towards, it's creating less losers, less people who feel disenfranchised by the system. You

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       know, if you're, if you're, if you can pay x amount of tax dollars but live in an exponentially more safe and friendly and happy environment. I think most people would be leaning towards that. I think it would

Speaker 3:          01:14:24       because. Yeah, I mean, and we'll see this. We see us too. And um, people that start companies where as a huge risk to start a company, most people fail. And most entrepreneurs in silicon valley are men who are much more willing to take risks, but if we do have some sort of strong safety net then it won't be so bad if you fail. And maybe that'll help address some of the gender gap too.

Speaker 1:          01:14:51       That's interesting. You know, it's, we want women to succeed in these positions so badly that like a woman ceo can become like a superstar. Like that lady from that blood testing company that turned out to be bullshit. Was that Thanos? Is that the name of it? There are. No, sir. That was a fascinating case. This woman essentially was role playing as a female steve jobs with a bullshit product that didn't really do what it was advertised to do and her company was valued at something like 30 something billion dollars and she was thought to be the richest self made woman in the world. And then almost overnight she's worth nothing because they found out it doesn't work. And the company sort of fell apart. There it is. How Elizabeth Holmes House of cards game came tumbling town. It is a fascinating story because this woman look at her, they're dressed the part put on a fucking black turtleneck.

Speaker 1:          01:15:52       I mean, she dressed like Steve Jobs. I remember, um, she gave this speech once at some woman's for women's success group for something or another. And uh, she got up there and in this like unprepared rambling, stupid speech and I was like, how is this woman this super genius? Well, it turns out she wasn't, you know, she dropped out of college at Nineteen and, and created this company. She started this when she was in college, you know, and she, she basically just fit what people were looking for, you know, and, and bullshitted away to billions almost, you know, to kind of crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:16:31       Yeah. A lot of people are very willing to see that whatever narrative they want. Yeah. And I, and we see this all the time in the media too, where they just fit the data however they want.

Speaker 1:          01:16:43       Right. Which is why they wanted to call you a misogynist. Yeah. When I, when I first read that, I was like, wow. Like uh, this is a, this is a hot take by this lady who. Sure. The article, I think she wrote one of them was a let me lady explain what's going on with women in tech. Did you read that one? I saw. I don't remember. There's so many. Yeah, there's a lot of it, dude. There's a lot of it. So where are you right now? I mean, do

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       you, you obviously, did they give you some sort of a, a pension or something like that? They didn't have any money. They just fire you

Speaker 3:          01:17:16       now. I, yeah, I've been cheap throughout the years though. So he saved up some cash. That's good. Still trying to figure out what's next. Have you got any job offers? I've gotten random job offers from people but I haven't. Alright. It's hard to tell how serious they are. If you thought about writing a book yet. I have not seen much of a writer. So you wrote that memo pretty well? Yeah, I mean I'm famous for what I wrote, but I'm not, it's, you know, if I had been studying how to write and stuff my entire life, I wouldn't have been an engineer, but we did a great job with it though. Yeah, I mean it was very thorough. I like to think so. I, it, it addressed a lot of things and it's unfortunate that there was that one part that is getting so much attention when really it pointed out a lot of problems in our culture and a lot of suggestions for how to fix things and it seems like none of that is really gaining traction. Yeah, no, well it least, it started the conversation, right? Not at least for you because you got fired. I mean in some ways though, it has made it even more dangerous to bring these up. At least, you know, it's sort of empowered some people to at least understand some of the issues and hopefully these things will get brought up. But right now it's sort of a toxic, a tough topic to bring up at Google at least. Do you think that it's toxic in,

Speaker 4:          01:18:49       in the short term, but in the long term it'll inspire a more reasoned, balanced conversation once the dust has settled,

Speaker 3:          01:18:58       hopefully. And you know, that's sort of one of the hopes with the lawsuit is to show people that no, Google can't just do this, that there are limits to how much they can silence things. Yeah. And you shouldn't be afraid to point out issues in the workplace. Right. And you just said with the lawsuit like it's absolutely happening. Yeah, I believe we filed a claim with the nlrb which is the national labor relations board. Uh, and so they usually work with unions and you know, it's often employers that try to break up unions and fire people for joining unions. And that's illegal and you know, a lot of this, what I was doing was a conservative effort between multiple people that, you know, trying to improve the workplace and actually know whistle blow on some of the illegal practices.

Speaker 4:          01:19:52       Did you save emails where people were shaming people for being white or shaming people for having implicit bias because there were white or harassing people for

Speaker 3:          01:20:02       yet a lot of people have been doing this, like there's some efforts within google to at least document some of this because while they may not be the majority, they, they're sort of a silent, a coalition within Google that's sort of upset about a lot of this.

Speaker 1:          01:20:23       Oh, that's interesting. So there are some conservative people that work at Google. Yeah, I mean there's definitely more than zero, more than zero. Um, is it like 20 percent, like the amount that are represented, like women that are representing the company.

Speaker 3:          01:20:37       So I, it, it may be that or even lower, I think there's a lot of libertarians. So that would be the main counter to the extreme left. But, and then like, so like what the main retributions against people are the social conservatives and they feel completely alienated. So it's really unfortunate for them. But I, yeah, there's at least hundreds of them

Speaker 1:          01:21:09       now. When you say like social conservatives, like what, what do you, how do you classify that? Like what would,

Speaker 3:          01:21:16       I mean I guess people that believe in traditional values and

Speaker 1:          01:21:21       homophobes say it. So I think this is

Speaker 3:          01:21:28       a lot of what's happening too on where people just assume, okay, because you believe say in traditional values and you think that your marriage is an important thing and you know, I think that there is evidence that uh, you know, bringing out people in a two parent household whether or not it's, you know, the same sex or different sex that is important for children and there there's a huge disparity and outcome of people with only one parent versus two. So there is something to be said about marriage and having cultural norms that support that, but so you're just completely alienating that side of the argument is really negative and that's hurt our society in general, I think.

Speaker 1:          01:22:15       Yeah. Well I think anytime you silence discussion based on your own personal ideas of what should and shouldn't be debated, I think becomes an issue. I mean, you can disagree with someone and that's a very complicated issue when it comes to whether or not to parents or, or more beneficial to a child than one because obviously there's a lot of reasons why people break up, you know, you don't want to encourage people to be in toxic relationships and then show the child that, you know, this is a framework for a loving relationship. People that scream at each other and whatever horrible shit they do to each other, that gets super complicated and very, very personal. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:22:59       Yeah. It's, it's definitely a touchy subject, a very personal one. Yeah. So I, I don't know how to address that, but I think it's at least something that we should be cognizant of.

Speaker 1:          01:23:12       Has Anybody said when you know, these white people are being shamed in this, you know, as anybody ever stepped up and say, Hey, this is racist.

Speaker 3:          01:23:21       They might've but never in a public forum that I ever.

Speaker 1:          01:23:24       But publicly white people have been criticized.

Speaker 3:          01:23:27       Right. And you know, there's all these negative stereotypes of men and white people and you know, those gender stereotypes are fine. But, and you know, the whole idea that, you know, I'm only here because of my white male privilege, therefore I'm somehow worst programmer than all the other non white non males. Is that implied or is that stated? I think it's implied that they get it easier in life and in the interview process and evaluations. Yeah, white and Asian males. So how's it implied though? Can you give me an example? And they'll say explicitly that just yes, these, these groups of people are disadvantaged, these are advantaged, there's this privilege that they have and we've seen it time and again through all these evaluation processes that they're better evaluated and these are worse and yeah, they like, they often just see whatever data that they want, you know, like the case before where they just pulled out the female side without seeing that, oh the male side was pretty much the same [inaudible] and it's crazy and they, you even see it in some of their internal studies where, you know, they were trying to show how racist or sexist Google was and how worse women habits.

Speaker 3:          01:24:48       So they were looking at the code review process where you know, you can submit code to be reviewed and then someone has to approve it before it goes into the code base and they were looking at, okay, if a woman's the author of it, how many comments do they get on this review and you know, if they got more comments then that would mean that their work is more scrutinized. But if they got fewer comments then they were just ignored. And so there's no way out of it, you know, any result which show that women are being discriminated, discriminated against somehow.

Speaker 1:          01:25:23       Wow. Man, I'm glad I don't work where you worked. You happy to be free of that at all? I missed the free food. Good food there. Yeah, I liked the food a lot. I had a friend who is a big executive over there, a woman by the way, woman. Oh Shit. Um, yeah, she, she enjoyed it but she said it was a mess like in. She didn't know how, obviously have the same issues that you had, but she was like that. The whole thing is just chaos yet. Stupid shit going on over there. She hated it.

Speaker 3:          01:26:01       There's definitely, and I went in a little bit in this, in the document to where if you have a company that's to progressively run, then it'll be sort of this, you know, everyone's equal and no hierarchy and all chaos and are constantly changing wild, you know, the opposite of a really conservative company where there's a lot of hierarchy decisions are made from the top with which may not be, you know, very easy to change things. So like iron. Google is definitely more of the former where there is a lot of chaos and there's multiple teams working on the same thing and it's just this is how we have multiple products that end up doing the same thing and we have to deprecate some bright like we have. That's very inefficient for different chat apps. Well Google is

Speaker 1:          01:26:52       as in the technology realm, but they're not, they don't have a lot of competition. That's what's really interesting. But then they do in certain ways, right? Like they do in the phone way. Like they put out the Pixel, which I bought, which is kind of a fucked up phone. Yeah. It doesn't feel like the, the microphone doesn't work all the time. Yeah. Like could you have to let go to speakerphone and then bring it back to microphone? Just a bunch of bugs. So quite a few issues with it. Then there's the android operating system which a lot of people prefer. So I think they're like pretty competitive in that round. But like um, when it comes to like search engine, so they don't really have competition. That's where it gets real sneaky because a lot of power in that search search engine. And then in Gmail. What, what? Uh. Well you know, what competition they have in Gmail as a fuck about hotmail. I started using

Speaker 3:          01:27:42       Yahoo Mail because people were really suspicious that google would eventually read my email. Oh Wow. Do you really worry about that? That they would spy on your email? There were some weird things happening to my phone, so I had like one attached to it yet. What? Uh, so my Corp, so Corp, my work phone and basically. Okay. And it started like rebooting and after this whole controversy given android. Yeah, it's. And this had never happened before and it hasn't happened and didn't like all these random apps started updating. It was Kinda scary. But. So do you think they start spying on you? It's your way to find out. I don't know if there's a way to find out. Fuck,

Speaker 1:          01:28:31       I'd put my phone aside and bring it to light the top technologist and go, listen, we've got to go over this because that'll be giant dude. If you found they were spying on you, is there anything in your contract that allows them to spy on you? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:28:44       there's some random things where they. Yeah, they can basically just spy on you completely. Yeah. Like how, so uh, so all of your keystrokes or sort of logged in at work or. I'm the work computer. Yeah. Not necessarily your personal laptop or anything. Okay. What about your phone yet? So I don't know exactly what they do, but the corporate phone, my Google Dot com account attached to it. Okay. But it wasn't your personal phone? Yeah, I bought it. But then. Oh, so yeah, they, they reserved the right to like completely new kit and what? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:29:24       served right to, to nuke your personal phone. Now this corporate phone, are you allowed to use it for like say if you go on a date or you want to buy a movie ticket or. So you're allowed to use that.

Speaker 3:          01:29:32       Yeah, so that's a weird marriage of two worlds, isn't it? Yeah, it's, some people would own two phones because of that, but you know, I was, I'm a cheap person again, I don't want to have google pay for extra stuff and I mean I can understand why they would want that because especially, you know, I was traveling to China for some of my work and supposedly if they see that you work for Google, they'll just steal your laptop or your phone or they won't even explicitly steal it. They'll go into your room and then install some software on it and then just put it there and then the Chinese government will somehow get into Google's networks. Whoa. So I mean they're rightfully paranoid about somethings, but sometimes it's you don't want to give one entity too much power.

Speaker 4:          01:30:24       Yeah. My friend who worked for Google was very upset at this whole China thing because essentially she was saying they have to agree to censorship the Chinese censorship and that the only alternative is to let China steel all of what Google's doing and make a fake google because that's what they were doing apparently. Yeah. To make sure that they didn't allow that. And then to do that they had to have certain things like tenement square, you couldn't search for that and it's like a lot of weird shit that they would have to sensor any dissented the government and you know, gets very slippery. Right? I mean like yeah, you're anti diverse or you're pro diversity, but you're also, you're supporting that like as a company that's a giant issue. Like to allow China to censor it citizens. I mean you're, you're essentially promoting a dictatorship in that regard.

Speaker 3:          01:31:19       Yeah. It's sort of a lose lose. I don't know what exactly they should do and they just did it for business. I think I just made a business choice and so fucking scary choice to. Yeah, well I mean they. They were in China and they supported some of this stuff, but then they eventually chose not to because they backed out of it. Is that recent? That was a, I don't know. Before my time at Google at nationally, so they decided to get out so they're not involved with China anymore. It's blocked by the firewall. China block, Google and all of Google services.

Speaker 4:          01:31:54       Don't they have some weird thing you can get around that though, but that's super illegal if you get around that, you get in really big trouble.

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       Yeah. Although their official policy is that there is no firewall, so I don't know if they have any laws to actually imagine that fucking building people. They figured out how to do that to them yet, although I think China is not the only case where this is happening. There's other countries where Google also has the sensor. Really? Yeah, like in the Middle East. There's some company or some countries that do that. It gets really complicated.

Speaker 1:          01:32:29       Yeah. I could imagine. Look, I don't envy them, I don't, and I don't envy any of the people that work there and management that are sort of responsible for putting out, you know, an infinite number of forest fires all around them all the time. Social Economic, you know, dealing with different cultures. It's not, it doesn't seem like it'd be an easy gig.

Speaker 3:          01:32:53       Yeah. And I, one of the ways they have now too is you know, even though they have a large market share for a search, they see search as sort of a gateway to the world and they don't necessarily have a huge market share for that because you know, facebook and twitter are also ways to get to the world's information and a lot of facebook just, it's just a walled garden where Google can't really get into that. So some people just. And you know, on your phone you spend most of your time on facebook or something and not necessarily just doing random google searches, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:33:30       Yeah. I got off of that. I don't really go on facebook for that very reason. It seems to be to be the biggest sucker time that we have. I just, I feel like twitter to me is like, it's limited by 140 characters. It seems pretty straightforward. I get links. Good. Interesting. Stories get sent to me that for my needs that's more, it's more appealing. And then instagram is very appealing because I like images so you can look at pictures and sometimes people write cool captions and you find out about interesting shit. But facebook is like, whew, boy, you're gonna lose a lot of time on that motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          01:34:08       Oh, so this is a random tangent. But I knew so I worked on image search and they also see that even though there isn't a huge competitor for image search, there's instagram and pinterest which are very similar things and you know, we do our demographic research and we really look into why people are using these products and we see that the majority of the users are women and you know, they actually know why that is. It's that women prefer, you know, art and aesthetics over men and on average. Right. And that's exactly what I had in the document, like we openly acknowledge this when we're looking at the products because otherwise you're not going to give these random ads to people that you know, if you know that they're a man and you're not going to give them ads for

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       women products, you know. So ad science does discriminate and stereotype people in some ways, but it's okay now they're getting into trying to de bias machine learning. So if they do see any things that the machine learning has learned these statistical anomalies or just trends in the data, then they'll try to remove that. Why that seems like it would be less effective. It's less effective, but they see it as discrimination. Social Justice. Yeah. It's

Speaker 5:          01:35:40       and mess. What a mess. Bang. You need to step up your game. Come on back. Bring back that windows phone. Come on. Hotmail. Microsoft had hotmail, right? Nobody uses hotmail. Does that even real anymore? They have hotmail I think so I saw, I've been getting a lot of emails from, you know, pretty paranoid people and some of them are from hot now. So. Oh yeah. How about AOL? Yeah. Well dot comment on. Well, what the fuck all is real. Who the hell is aol? Where are you right now? Like where we're, where are you? What do you do with your time? The I read books, uh, respond to media requires a lot of them. Yeah. I still get a lot and you know, thankfully now some of them are more of the long form, which ilr I like a lot more than just the five minute TV thing.

Speaker 5:          01:36:32       I wanted to give you as much time as he could to just talk about this and especially after I heard you on Ben Shapiro, Cheryl show, I'm like this getting the shaft. You're very reasonable person. You're not a misogynist at all as far as I can tell he, you don't seem like a sexist. You don't seem cruel. You're not like the type of person. I think we'd go out of their way to promote some sort of a quote unquote harmful stereotype gender stereotype. It just seems so weird. Especially like I personally am just very conscious about a lot of these gender stereotypes and you know, I use the word day whenever the, uh, when I read the gender of someone is unknown or just unimportant [inaudible] and like I try to avoid using guys instead of just like you all or something. Yeah. I say folks, I try to say folks now because I used to say guys lot, you know, I try to use the term folks yet for that very reason.

Speaker 5:          01:37:27       Yeah. And you know, if I get married, I, I would actually try to merge our last name somehow. Don't do that dude. Not, not like the highest band, not the hyphen, but just like create a new name, create a new name. That would be the coolest if, if you can do it. Well, you know, the former mayor of Los Angeles did that. Really? Yeah. His name is Tony Volare and his wife had this ethnic name and so they changed it and put it together and he came to Villa Arago Lavilla or Villaraigosa. I think that's what his name was, but it made him seem like he was Mexican and so that's why you went with it and he kept it even after they got divorced. Yeah, it's super like Adam Kroll is shits on them for it. I didn't even know about it until he explained it to me. I went what?

Speaker 5:          01:38:12       Like it's a fake name because I mean I just, I, I don't. I wouldn't want my wife to take my last name and lose theirs. I refuse to let my wife use her own name. You can? Yeah. Villa or young. Go saw Villaraigosa for Laura goes. You could make a really cool last name. Yeah, that's what he did. I mean, he was Volare Antonio Ramon Volare junior and his wife was a Ria. Goza. That's pretty cool. Then they split up, but he kept that name. Kept that fucking ethnic name. As long as you don't Google search at when you do you go, Hey, what? What's your dad's name, Bro?

Speaker 5:          01:38:58       Yeah. I mean there are people that have stage names are okay. Yeah. I'm Nikki Glaser at a very funny joke about that and she stand up. Comedian, she had a funny joke about, um, your old name, you know, and then like when a woman gets married and then like her all, her name is when her son and gets locked out of his bank account and needs to know mom was your old day. Like in terms of like how to access his account with a password. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it'd be nice if everybody just kept their own fucking name. But then once you do to the kids, that's yes. To kill the kid, to pick your favorite parent. Yeah. Who's your favorite parent? Have a meritocracy inside your own family now you can't do that, right? Yeah. And then if you have it, so the first child is this second child, is that, then it just gets too confusing.

Speaker 5:          01:39:50       And then what if you changed your name and then you break up, you go back to your old name. It depends on how cool it is a bit out of and then you keep it. It's good. It keeps you in great shape with the ethnic market markets maybe. Maybe. Yeah. Tricky. I don't know. Marriage in itself is very weird. It's some sort of strange legal contract with the state that involves relationships, which is just so bizarre, which is why 50 percent of them fall apart, you know, and that's. Chris Rock had a great joke about that. That's the coward's that stay like how many, how many of the people stay 50 percent left. Like how many people are fucking miserable and they're still involved in that contract and it's 50 percent that fail. It's a good argument, you know? Yeah. It is. It the 50 percent of the initial ones get a breaking up or just 50 percent of all marriages.

Speaker 5:          01:40:45       So like there are some that get married 10 times and they get counted in that 50 percent. Yes. Because initial marriages, like if you get a union. I do, I do. How many of those work? Fifty percent stay unionized? Oh Man. Of the first one. That's pretty bad. It's not good. Yeah, it's not good. I'm, I'm happily married and I tell people don't do it. I'm worried that it's not worth it, it's a fucking ridiculous proposition. And if you're, um, whether you're male or female, that makes a lot of money and the spouse doesn't, then you run into this very weird situation, you know, it's, it's scary. [inaudible] and you know, potential of losing custody of kids. Yes. Yeah. It gets real weird, but it makes sense with children because you know, like look, creating life is way more of a commitment than divorce and marriage because you could, you could easily get divorced.

Speaker 5:          01:41:39       People do it every day, but creating life is like, that's a significant responsibility. I mean it's gigantic. You could get along with someone else. I mean you could get divorced and go through all the turmoil and all the stress and then find a new person and maybe they'll be. Maybe it'll be better. Maybe marry that person and to work out. Well maybe you learned from your first relationship, but I think the commitment of raising a human being is way more of a, like a serious long term responsibility. So if you could do that, like you can stay married, if it work it out, as long as the person's reasonable get a reasonable person would. Do you know anyone that's getting an arranged marriage or has arranged marriage? No, I don't because those actually it was a weird day. Stay together more than not 50 percent. Really?

Speaker 5:          01:42:31       Yeah. So like, like, uh, like rich parents get together with another rich family and they bring over the daughter and we kind of not necessarily just rich. I think that happens a lot and more traditional countries like India, it's still happens. What does that, the divorce is over, but the myth lives on. That's a chick or wrote that. I just thought propaganda. That's fake news. Get that shit off the screen. What does it say? I just saw another article in psychology today. It said it's down to about 25 or 75 percent survive. Wow. Yeah. One in four and a divorce. But if you get married a second or third time, the rates go way up. Yeah, that makes sense. It says it's like a myth, quote unquote myth from the seventies and eighties. But there also isn't the amount of time if you got married in the last 10 years to say you're going to get divorced in 20 more years, I would like to know what the actual hard data with the United States of America. Because culturally it gets weird when you look across the different countries. But what about the United States of America? What are the percentage of people who get married to wind up getting divorced? Let's find that out. What do you say it is? Oh, across the world? No, no, no. Just United States. The United States. I would think I'm sort of trusting that random. You think it's about 25 percent? Get divorced. Divorce rate in the US drops to nearly 40 year low. Wow. Look at this represents

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       a jump from 31 point nine and 2014 and is the highest number. Okay. 30 two point two. Okay. Marriage rates the other hand have increased. There's 32 point two marriages for every thousand unmarried, but what is the divorce rate? 16 point nine for a thousand married women. Fifteen year old. What is the fucking percentage? You fucking 23. They throw around too many 50 percent chance. Okay. Typical marriage is still have a 50 percent chance of lasting. That's all I said. So same goddamn number. Researchers have found that typical marriage is still have about a 50 percent chance of lasting. That's very fucking.

Speaker 3:          01:44:31       This is still just colored including the second and third marriages and beyond.

Speaker 4:          01:44:38       Well, marriage is marriage. I mean if you have a second, marriage means you failed. It means you got divorced. Yeah. Yeah. But if. Go back to that Jamie please. It says researchers have found that typical marriages still have a 50 percent chance of lasting. That means you have a 50 percent chance of not lasting,

Speaker 3:          01:44:59       but that's just assuming you look at every single marriage, but if you look at the first marriage, then maybe you have a 70 percent chance of never getting a divorce and then. But if you do get it,

Speaker 4:          01:45:11       so you like factored in when people are in like the second, third and fourth, Maryland. Those Elizabeth Taylor type folks. I was like nine or 10 marriages,

Speaker 3:          01:45:22       so it might have reduced because people are just getting married later, so they're choosing rather than just, Oh, I got pregnant when I was young or I didn't have anything else to do, so I got married.

Speaker 4:          01:45:34       We'll get that. Hawaii had the lowest because it's fucking awesome. Then maybe if you live somewhere awesome, they have universal basic income. Great. Why? They're great marriages. What did you put up, Jamie? What do you highlighted?

Speaker 3:          01:45:46       Uh, just other things that they're saying factor and like cohabitating has become less stigmatized so they're not living together but not getting married as another thing.

Speaker 4:          01:45:54       Oh, okay. People don't look to shore up and unstable relationship. Marriage rates have been declining for years, so less people get married, but the percentage is still. You also don't have to get married when you have a kid right now. That's right. Right, right. Brushing and do it. Right. Right, right. It's less stigmatized. [inaudible]. Yeah. I mean, imagine if that was a friendship thing. Okay man, we be best friends or what? Fucking go to court dude, and do this. I mean it's just this weird. I mean, it really is, it does, it makes sense for some people. They like it. People like rituals, you know, feels good to know, like say it and do it and make it real and jump over the broom like they didn't roots.

Speaker 3:          01:46:37       I think one interesting thing that I was looking into a little bit was the rates of divorce for homosexual marriages because that, that's also sort of interesting. So one thing about heterosexual is

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       women and initiate the divorce in 70 percent of cases. Of course they do, which is, you know, I wouldn't have necessarily predicted that Adeline. So I think when we get pissed more like that on you tell you. Yeah, I guess, but relationships that you've been in, have women been pissed off at you more than you've been pissed off at them or the opposite? Definitely. They get mad at me. Says you're a God damn. Promoting harmful gender stereotypes. I sign up. I generally just don't get that angry. So I think that's part of it, but that's probably where they get mad at you. You don't even fucking care. And so like, not to push on the one thing that sort of hurt me, but the neuroticism trait is actually has been linked to on stable marriages. Women having more of that has been part of the explanation for why.

Speaker 5:          01:47:39       And so you see in lesbian couples, they also have a higher rate of divorce then the gay couple, the gay men. That's interesting. So like part of it is women want to settle down much faster so they'll move in within like a month. And then, which obviously is, you're too soon to know whether or not that's a longterm chip. Well, especially if neither one of you are flexible and you know, sort of adapt to each other's needs and desires. So, uh, I interrupted you though. What is the percentage of gay men who, how often are they get divorced, I don't know the exact numbers, but it's lower than the lesbian one and because we only had the last few years or so of gay marriage. So we don't know the actual long term rates, but it's certainly interesting because, you know, it's a world that I don't know much about. Brian has, um, how have you come through all this, like do you feel damaged by this at all?

Speaker 5:          01:48:41       Do you feel like your name is this marched a definitely, you know, I, I just went to a party with my friends and some of them were much closer to and I had already talked to about this some I hadn't and you know, you never know how they felt about it. So some, it seemed like they, you know, I could tell that they were like, oh yeah man, hey, what's up bus bro. Keep it secret handshake. But others were maybe a little averse to me. So that may happen in the future, but prejudices that they have going into the conversation. Yeah. And Oh, I didn't know that you are a sexist. What have you gotten that if he hadn't been people like outright insulting you. There was one person that was on just on the roads, just f you. Really? Yeah, in the road. Where was this in mountain view? So you're driving your car? I just got out of my car and they just

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       yelled at were female. It was a guy. And what he say just after you just fuck you for what? For how do you know that? That's why he said that. Uh, well yeah. I mean I've never really been yelled at except by like crazy people on the street with this guy look like just normal nerd guy.

Speaker 1:          01:50:11       Did he have his girlfriend with him trying to press her? Maybe that con, that Shit. I want to smack him,

Speaker 3:          01:50:19       God. But I, most of the support or at least like personal interactions have been in support of me. So there've been random people like, oh, are you James Tomorrow? It's like, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:50:31       Wow. So one guy with a girl yelled out, fuck you. And he looked like a nerd. She'll, she'll dump him. Don't worry about it, buddy. It'll all come around. I had a friend that was like that. He was super fucking male feminist. And then eventually his, uh, his spouse went nutty on them and crazy. And then all of her friends went nutty on him. And now he's like, he man, woman haters club. He went the other way. Oh really? Not totally, but he's like, what the fuck man? I'm like, yeah, you can't just rely on a gender to be cool to rely on individual human beings and their personalities and their actions and their character. I can't believe we have to actually go over this, but no, like all in all, men aren't great. All in all. Women aren't great. You find unique people that are cool in all sorts of groups.

Speaker 3:          01:51:23       Yeah. And you know, once you start aligning yourself with one of these groups and you know, if you ever go against any of their principals and you know, they're constantly changing and getting more extreme, then you'll eventually get ostracized and yeah, that's what happened.

Speaker 1:          01:51:40       That that's a big issue with the left. Sure. You know, left eats itself, but I don't think that's as much of an issue with the conservative. Right? Rational conservatives not like racists and like full right wing nuts. But you know, I think

Speaker 3:          01:51:57       what people just want,

Speaker 1:          01:51:59       they, they want harmony. I think overall they want to succeed and they want harmony, which sometimes are mutually exclusive.

Speaker 3:          01:52:07       Yeah. And you know, a lot of people just don't acknowledge that, you know, most people are normal and they're just, yeah, want to live their life and you know, even though they might have voted for trump for something, they're not some evil person, they're not the KKK, which I've met a lot of people in Silicon valley that basically equate voting for trump and being in the KKK. Yeah. Yeah, that's harmful. That's really splitting groups. And you know, if you're going to build products that are for the entire world, then you really need to understand other people especially, you know, a lot of the world is actually more conservative than. I mean Europe may be more liberal than the US in some ways, but a lot of Asia and Africa and South America is more conservative than we are. So we need to at least understand what's happening and what their worldview is. Yeah. The idea that everyone who voted for trump is a

Speaker 4:          01:53:08       in the KKK so crazy, but it's convenient to demonize the other. We would love to do that. We'd love to look at groups and just block ourselves off. And this is us and we're on the right and these people on the other side there, they're incorrect and it's a real normal common tendency that human beings have that we should be very, very aware of, but we're not, you know, we have these convenient blinders that we put on whenever we're engaging in a sort of ideological discussions where our belief systems might be challenged where we dig our heels in and like, this is it. I think you see a lot of that with the left, with this whole. Like you can not be progressive enough. Like it's like they're getting wackier and whack here with it. It's just really weird.

Speaker 3:          01:53:53       Yeah. No, no concept of, you know, okay, I am an ally with you on this thing, even though we may disagree on this other subject. And that's just completely impossible in their head.

Speaker 4:          01:54:06       Yeah. Well I don't think there's enough real discussions going on in this world too. I think people are a lot of times following these predetermined patterns of behavior. They think they're expected to follow as a progressive or as a conservative and then they just go with it. And then when they do engage with someone who has a different opinion, then it becomes a in quotes game again, it's trying to win rather than trying to understand like what this person sees and what they think. And what is your philosophy like how were you approaching this? And trying to be like really open minded about it. You know,

Speaker 3:          01:54:41       like I see this even in myself when I'm talking to someone and you know, maybe there are feminists are like extreme in some way and like I'll discuss them and I'll immediately just stereotype them as someone that's even more extreme and I'll read into their words of Oh you said that that means that you mean this. And even though you know, maybe it's important to at least show what the extreme outcome would be and therefore we can't just take this on principle. But you know, everyone does it and it's really hard to not do it.

Speaker 4:          01:55:16       It is hard to not do it. It's one of the reasons why I think like long form form conversations are so important. And how often do you ever sit down like this with someone and talk for a couple hours with just you and the person talking, not looking at your phone, not checking the TV? Not, no, no. We were very rarely do this. I think this is one of the only ways we could really work out ideas, especially when you're talking to someone that might have a different opinion, but they also might intelligent and you might be able to like sort it out. Let me parse out what your thoughts are and see where I differ and how you got to where you got and maybe they'll have a better understanding of your philosophy and. But there's a lot of people that don't even have a philosophy.

Speaker 4:          01:55:59       It is, it sounds good. So they just go with this predetermined pattern that's easy to follow as a left wing. Progressive. I feel this, I mean, I've heard people say that before, like as a Democrat, I've always felt like, oh, we as a demo. How about as a fucking person that's. No, it's not. It's, um, ideas are hard, you know, thoughts on life and how we cohabitate and how we move through this fucking existence together. It's very difficult to work out. We were just so many variables, so many styles of human, you know, there's just so many different things that we have to work through together and to try to, to try to do that based on patterns that other people have established and that you cannot break and then, you know, have these. I mean, that's one of the reasons why it's so ruthless to say that all white people have some implicit biases that they may or not, may not even be aware of. And this, uh, you know, unintended racism, flavors, all conversations like this, poisoning this conversation, you're poisoning this conversation within a fucking fishing line. It's all tangled up there. Now we're going to have to figure out what is real and pull us apart and get it back on the spool. No.

Speaker 3:          01:57:18       Yeah. And there's no solution for some of those too where you just say there's some boogeyman man type thing that's controlling all of this and there's some conspiracy that we can't really see and we can't point out specific examples, but it's ever present. And I, I think, yeah, a lot of the treating people as individuals that has become more of a libertarian thing. Yeah. And so it's hard to, at least for me to understand some of this more collective thinking and social conformity, which I've never been a fan of. But

Speaker 4:          01:57:56       do you think it was a good idea to write that memo? Like if you had to go back again, if you were in front of your computer and you're ready press, would you uh,

Speaker 3:          01:58:05       maybe I would wait for my year end bonus

Speaker 4:          01:58:12       man.

Speaker 3:          01:58:14       I mean I think I would have pushed harder, even harder on the diversity programs, although like I met with them personally and I kept pinging them and I sent so many emails. I'm just trying to have a discussion about this. And I went through multiple programs and sent this document, this exact document to them. So it's really unclear what I could've done differently, but I, I, for example, I didn't know so much about the underground conservative network before all of this. At Google you mean? Yeah. And even within silicon valley, like there's attempts to sort of connect them between companies, but there's so much verification that you need to go through to be able to join one of these. You have to have a pseudonym. Uh, I mean you don't need to be totally anonymous, but you know, you, you don't want because there's active attempts to try to infiltrate these groups. Really. Yeah. I, this happens a lot where they'll try to join a group act as if they're one of them and then just, you know, record what's happening and then expose them

Speaker 1:          01:59:19       and you know, you can take anything out of context and it would be shown as you know, racism or something. Sure. What mean. Think of what we said, well, not you but me joking around in this conversation. You could clearly take something I've said out of context and make my monster, but if you're in an email and you're complaining about some sort of diversity program.

Speaker 3:          01:59:41       Yeah, like what they often do is they will find someone that they disagree with and then they'll scour through their entire history at Google and all of the emails that they've signed and try to look for some way to blacklist them or show that this person is evil, therefore they should be fired. Oh, it's horrible. And supposedly this is happening in other companies too, and they even have like these automated scripts to try to find these negative things on people that they don't like.

Speaker 1:          02:00:13       Wow. So a little little psychological covert warfare. Yeah. And that's also going to contribute to people towing the line. Right. They don't want to keep their job. Like look at you just said maybe you would have waited until you got your year end bonus people. I mean, and you are a single guy, right? Yeah. So family, that definitely helped where I don't have as many responsibilities. I imagine if he did, you know, you probably wouldn't have said anything you had thought about it and go, you know what, I have to worry about my family and taking care of my bills and

Speaker 3:          02:00:45       so weird band. Yeah. I mean the worst part is these people think that they're doing the right thing, right? Like censoring people and finding these people is the right thing because any of those people are wrong. Yeah. So that's how they think. They think, okay, I have everyone sees the world the same. Therefore anyone that disagrees with me is either misinformed or a misogynist bigot. Right. Otherwise, how could I have possibly said those things? Yeah. When really, you know, I, people with different political ideologies see the world differently and they have different biases and you know, none of them are totally correct, but we need to be able to discuss things, to show, you know, a more objective view of the world without a doubt. The fact that that is even up for debate is a very strange. I mean, that's an ideological echo chamber and that seems like for whatever reason that seems like where a tech is and that's where technology companies seem to lean towards this very left wing ideological echo chamber.

Speaker 3:          02:01:56       Yeah. And I mean I saw it a lot too on the comments of a document where I said, Oh yeah, these are just biases. And no, they were like, no, the right is indoctrinated. They're just KKK and there anti-education they're anti poor people. They're anti everything, like not all of them. And yet at least the way I see it and not being, you know, total conservative. I can't necessarily say, but it seems like they don't necessarily hate poor people or anything. They just think that these certain incentive structures are what's best for society and you know, it's not best to promote or they think that some things will lead to laziness or something. And that's not saying, Oh yeah, these people are just horrible people. They actually want to help everyone. And they think that these, uh, social norms and government programs may be hurting people.

Speaker 1:          02:02:53       Yeah, I mean there certainly are some people that are right wing that think like that and then there's some people that are right wing that are really racist. Yeah. And they, they exist too and there's some people that are left wing that are really racist and they're really racist towards white people. I mean, that's, that's there's white people that are racist towards white people. I mean, I've read so many fucking tweets from people that, you know, like I've, I follow a bunch of anti social justice warrior accounts and they'll find people that tweet like really horrible shit about white people that are white. It's like I get what you're doing, just try to get those Brownie points, trying to try super hard to get people of color to love you. And you know, as an ally, it's just very strange time. I think a lot of it has to do with this new found ability to communicate that just really did not exist in the past.

Speaker 1:          02:03:41       If you wanted to get controversial ideas past, uh, you know, two massive groups of people in the past, you had to write a book or you had to get an article published, you had to be some sort of a major media distribution center, had to take your work and put it out there for the people. Now that's not the case, so now you get a lot of, like really fragile or really poorly thought out ideas and uh, as long as you can hit the nerve of enough retards, you can get those things out. And then they start promoting. I mean, that's where the flat earth movement is coming from. What does that, other than that, I mean, that's exactly what it is. It's enough people that just don't have a sense of the importance of critical thinking skills or are not used to objectives, assessing ideas. And then they, they coalesce in these groups that are likeminded and you can get that with racism. You can get that with sexism.

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       You can get that with pretty much anything, right? You get these likeminded groups, they get together and they have confirmation bias and they get an ideological echo chamber and they start reinforcing each other, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:04:49       Yeah, and definitely. I mean it affects who you follow and you just assume, oh yeah, everyone thinks like this, therefore it must be. Right. Yeah, and I mean it's really a shame though, that this is happening even in the pursuit of knowledge in academia where so many people, how a certain worldview, like the social sciences have 90 percent of people lean left. Yeah. And that's, that can create its own confirmation biases and especially when you know it's, it's definitely bad like in tech where 20 percent of people are women and they can feel alienated, but at least no overt signs of sexism are seen as bad. Right. But over signs of discriminating against people based on their political orientation is seen as okay and people do it. And so yeah, there's a big asymmetry there where you actually feel it's justified to.

Speaker 4:          02:05:49       Maybe it wouldn't be as big of an issue if we had a reasonable republican president. Maybe if we had someone who was really kind and rational, Mitt Romney type who seemed like far more reasonable and you know, it's

Speaker 3:          02:06:06       sort of,

Speaker 4:          02:06:08       you know, I mean, wow, we have a bunch of issues obviously as a country now with this guy is president and I think that we're also dealing with a really young, an infant stage of information distribution. Like a, the ability for anyone to mass distribute anything is. So like anyone can create a, a, you know, a youtube video and if it strikes a cord it can hit a million people like that this time like that before where, you know, I mean,

Speaker 3:          02:06:41       and the incentive structures are all out of whack where it's better to be outrageous than it is to be honest. And that that's causing a lot of our headlines to just be, you know, oh, he starts a sexist and there's no room for nuance,

Speaker 4:          02:06:58       but it'll also don't, you think that it's, there's a lack of time that people have. Just like I told you how much time I spent going over your stuff. And and after awhile I was like, what the fuck am I doing? I think it would work in tech, but most people don't have that kind of time. Nor do they have that sort of obsessive mindset. They look at the surface of something, oh, this guy wrote a sexist memo about women in tech. Fuck him. It's probably a misogynist, and they just marched towards their meeting and we have to avoid the kind of thinking that lead to someone thinking that it's okay to write the Google memo and then everyone like, yes, here I want my year end bonus. I think as the dust settles we will get more and more truth out of people. And I think there's a general trend with information to, to have information be easier and easier to distribute.

Speaker 4:          02:07:56       That's the one of the most important things about technology, right? They're instantaneous access to information and right now that information is not entirely verifiable. Like some of it is and some of it's not. And that's one of the more disturbing things about people reprinting your memo without citations. I was like, Hey, like you fuckers, you left out a big part of what this is like, what you did is really wrong. Um, those citations, maybe people won't go into them. Maybe they won't read the studies. Maybe they won't let me, it takes a long time if you really want to get involved in that, but there will be a better version of that in the future of. I think they will. I think. I think that's where the, I mean obviously I don't know, but I think that's where the trend is. I think the trend is leaning towards more and more honest interpretation of facts and ideas and then you know, we'll be left with some, some things that we have to look at that we can't just write off to sociology or write off to culture or off to biases or sexism or racism.

Speaker 4:          02:08:56       We're going to have to look at things for what they really are and maybe we'll have a better understanding of why we behave the way we do, why we have the problems that we have.

Speaker 3:          02:09:06       Yeah. And part of the issue though is if someone controls the access to information and they want a certain area to be told, then you know, it'll really color what people see. And that's what's scary. And you know, we see this a lot on youtube now where they're demonetizing anyone that they see as right wing and no even censoring and removing videos. It's really scary. It is. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:09:37       It's fascinating. I mean it's, it's, uh, it's, it's quite fascinating to watch it all play out and to have them do it like right in front of everybody's face. And everybody goes, what are you doing like you are, you're changing narratives. You're altering information. And they feel like they are right. They're doing the right thing. They're promoting diversity. They're promoting liberal values and progressive ideas and they think they're doing the right thing. Don't necessarily think they're right though, you know, it's just a lot of blow back though. I mean, this is not free. It's not free ride for Google right now with what they've done to you. I mean, I'm sure there's been, I mean, I'm sure they're doubling down because they don't want to admit they're fucked up. If they admit they're fucked up, everybody across the board loses that year end bonus becomes a real issue, right?

Speaker 4:          02:10:26       Everybody gets fired. But if they, uh, you know, if you look at it long term over the long run, I mean they have definitely taken a hit and if someone forces them to sit down, I would love to sit down with the guy who said that you promote harmful gender stereotypes and go, let's go, let's go to this thing. Step by step. You tell me what's wrong and just pick them apart. That's what I've always wanted. But he'll fall apart 100 percent. I just say a bunch of stupid social justice warrior bullshit. And if you just keep them in a room for three hours of the microphone, it's going to look like a fucking idiot. Just no way around it. You know? There's no way around it. If you're just active, if you actually going off of what you wrote to somehow or another, I think it's very not just dangerous to say it promotes harmful gender stereotypes. It's disingenuous. And why? The reason why it's dangerous is because I could just read what that guy said and I would think that you're a creep and that's dangerous to you. It's dangerous towards the marketplace of free ideas. The marketplace of ideas is extremely important and I would think that if anybody would know that it would be the people that are involved in tech, you would think so? Yeah. I mean they're just so wrapped up just so wrapped up in the progressive mindset.

Speaker 3:          02:11:46       It's weird, man. It's circulated to all this microaggression. Speech is violence and yeah, all ideas are harmful and, and of course some ideas are harmful, but it's only through openly discussing them. Can you actually dispel some of these things by making them, you know, forbidding knowledge that's only going to attract certain people and you know, we even see this now worth some of the youtube videos that are in this purgatory type state where you know, you can't really get to them, but if you know the url, you can still find that people are getting aggregated lists of those and actually viewing them and oh, this is what youtube doesn't want us to see. Maybe there's some truth to it. Why don't they want them to see it? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:12:39       If you win a certain amount of money, are you willing to buy a gold plated Ferrari and drive around with a fur coat? Because I think that Kinda Shit. Big Ass crazy sunglasses, a win.

Speaker 3:          02:12:55       I don't really know. And I mean I'm trying to. I mean what I would ideally want and somehow changing their policies, but I don't really know how I as an individual can compel google to do something like that. But I think at least some of the stuff like the blacklisting where they have these people that, you know, compile these spreadsheets of names of people that are conservative or even Libertarian and Oh, we're not going to work with them, we're going to sabotage their work and we're going to try to get them fired when they are looking for another job. We're going to share this list so they can't get hired from any of the

Speaker 5:          02:13:31       other major companies like that needs to. That's real. Yeah. That's real. How do you know that? That's real to have you seen this list yet? So there've been multiple people that have admitted to having a blacklist. Wow. I libertarian,

Speaker 4:          02:13:45       not even conservative, not even right wing, but smaller government libertarian.

Speaker 5:          02:13:52       Yeah. Just because, I mean it's generally free thinking, people not telling the party line and those people get blacklisted really. If there's an actual list somewhere. I think if you've seen an actual list. I haven't seen an individual list. I think there's multiple lists spread out, but people even like high up managers have admitted to having a car, a blacklist. Wow. And you know, we have brought this up to the highest people at Google and they just completely dismissed it, like we're not going to deal with it.

Speaker 4:          02:14:27       So do you feel like they feel that they have some sort of a social responsibility to push progressive values because they're in this massive position of influence and they feel like that's the right way to think. So they're going to go full steam ahead.

Speaker 5:          02:14:41       Yeah. And don't be evil. Don't be conservative. Pretty much the libertarian man. Boy, so fucking tough sell to say that Gary Johnson's evil, you know? I don't know. But yeah, it's, it's really hard to understand that mindset. But yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:15:05       I get it though because I think it's a lot of the same things along the same lines that you were talking about when you were saying that you didn't, you know, like maybe you would have waited till you got your year end bonus and you're a guy who is also a frugal. You've saved your money and you don't have a family to support and you're okay. You know, you got fired and you're still okay. You know. Whereas some people will be fucked right now. Maybe they'd be over extended, maybe they have that goal, Ferrari and the fur coat and shit. Yeah, I mean if I had a mortgage or something scary, that's where it gets scary. That's a lot of people's decision making. I mean that's, that goes back to you know, engineering civilization and the early days of Rome. I think there was writings about that, about getting people to commit to families and it's easier to control them when they have other ones and, and you know, and things that they enjoy and positions of power and status that it's easier to get those people to give into your needs and desires. Yeah, I mean it makes sense, right? I mean it's just engineering a civilization. It's one of the like getting people to perform and behave the way that you would like them to is a critical component of engineering. Any sort of civilization and is essentially a civilization if you look at it that way. I mean internally there's a is a community. It's a structure and their engineering that structured to be very a likeminded ideological echo chamber

Speaker 3:          02:16:34       and I think it's really going to bite them in the back at some point, like they're making the easy decision of not really facing the, you know, the truth as I see it. And you know, if you turn your back on that for too, too long, it's really going to have negative consequences later.

Speaker 4:          02:16:54       Yeah. Well I, I feel like one thing it's super important to point out, I think we kind of already did, but women do experience a lot of sexism. And again, it's because like I said, men are gross. You know, there's a lot of gross men and men working in close proximity with women. I mean men working with other men, they're going to find things they don't like about those men. Yeah, I mean people have interpersonal relationships are fucking gross and messy and if men work with women and they feel like they can dominate them with aggression or with some sort of weird tactics that play on the agreeableness, females tend to have the, you know, it's, it's a problem. And I think by not looking at it that by not being honest about that, we do just as much as of a disservice.

Speaker 3:          02:17:40       Yeah. Although, I mean, I would say that there are men that are just as agreeable and just as much of a pushover say yeah, sure. And they also get a Shandan aside and sometimes it's even worse for men that fit that stereotype or don't fit the typical male stereotype because you know, there's negative consequences on both sides for not being masculine if you're a man or not being feminine enough if you're a woman.

Speaker 4:          02:18:09       Yeah. Like you're not allowed to just be yourself. Right? You have to like fit why you're better off. You fit into some sort of a classic narrative. Yeah. So where do you go from here? Besides sue? In the form of Google. Google. Just give them some money to shut him out. Do you want to go through with a lawsuit? Like what if they came to you with a settlement? Would you just take it and shut your mouth?

Speaker 3:          02:18:30       I don't. I really want somehow for them to address it, but I don't know how to do

Speaker 4:          02:18:37       well. Even if they, if you lose in court, will they address it? They'll probably say, you know, although we support the court, we disagree with the rulings and we still support gender equality and yet,

Speaker 3:          02:18:49       I mean, I think part of it is that there is currently an asymmetry. So maybe Google is acting in their best interest to act the way that they are because they think that, you know, there's all these activists that are trying to attack Google that only if they don't fit this summer.

Speaker 4:          02:19:05       Are there a lot of activists that are attacking Google in that regard?

Speaker 3:          02:19:08       Yeah. And you know, we even see that there's now a potential class action lawsuit against Google about war, a gender pay disparity and so like they just are looking for anything. And if we say that if there's only incentive coming from one side, then only going to push farther and farther to that side. And this gender pay disparity is just involving similar jobs yet. So they claim that it's the same job. Although at least when Google was doing their own internal analysis, which they've been doing for years, they show that there's no disparity once you control for pay for performance, and so it's really unclear and,

Speaker 4:          02:19:55       but you control for performance performance tends to favor

Speaker 3:          02:19:59       males. Maybe I if, if that's what they're showing, that there is some sort of gender disparity. If you just look at aggregate,

Speaker 4:          02:20:05       look at this one in $100, million chance, alleged gender pay gap at Google is random. Says class action lawyer. Oh Jesus class action lawyer says that in the article is written by a chick fake fake news. You're not going to get me. You fucks.

Speaker 3:          02:20:23       I think one thing is I don't think that they really have Google's internal data, so there's no way for them to say whether or not it's based on performance liquid there. They're saying here, you know,

Speaker 4:          02:20:36       notices seeking women currently or formerly employed at Google for possible inclusion in a planned class action lawsuit. First of all, people hear that and they're like, we're going to get paid. Well, go Sizzla, right? I mean, that's just. You're playing on human instincts when you seek out people that may have been employed for a possible inclusion in a class action lawsuit. That's not saying that they weren't wronged because I don't obviously, I don't know, several dozen came forward in a matter of weeks. That's a pretty high level of dissatisfaction. Says James Feinberg. No, it's not. No, there's fucking thousands of people who've worked there and a couple dozen came forward. That's not a high level of satisfaction. How many people have been employed at Google that are no longer employed? It's probably tens of thousands, right?

Speaker 3:          02:21:25       Yeah. There's 70,000 people here.

Speaker 4:          02:21:27       Okay, so for this guy to say, that's a pretty high level of dissatisfaction when several dozen, let's say three dozen. Let's go crazy. Let's say it's 40 people. Let's get nuts. That's fucking nobody man. Oh, 70 women. It's biggest heard from. But wait a minute, hurt from it doesn't mean they might not even make sense. That might not be a case for four people for. That's not a lot. You fuck the class action. I mean that's just. This is. This is a fucking ambulance chaser Chaser, right? I mean, I'm not saying he's wrong, I'm not saying there's not sexual discrimination, but I'm saying like this, these articles are sneaky as fuck shock

Speaker 3:          02:22:15       for people. You got four people and I don't know how an individual would know whether or not they're paid differently just based on their sex. Right? Because there's so many variables at play, so you really have to look at the system as a whole because I mean there are definitely some men that are paid less than the women too for performance was like that.

Speaker 4:          02:22:35       The problem is when you control for performance, if it turns out that men are being paid more than you have to figure out some sort of a way to justify that. Or you know, like if men are being paid more when you control for performance, what is it that's causing the men to be paid more? Why are they performing better because of the environment they feel more comfortable. Is it lack of suppression that the women experience like.

Speaker 3:          02:22:59       Yeah. So I guess when you look at the nationwide gender gap in pay where you know even Obama has said seventy seven cents per dollar is too little.

Speaker 4:          02:23:08       Yeah, but he's a silly person. Like I shouldn't have done that. Like he, he knows. Like when Obama said that, he knows that that's not being honest because you're talking about completely different jobs, different choices for people don't know. Okay, let's just break that down real quick. This thing, because people repeated ad nauseum and it's just not true. The gender pay gap of seventy seven cents to a dollar that a male makes is based on the choices that people make as far as like what they do for a living. It's based on the amount of hours that they work. Men tend to work longer hours. Women tend, especially if they get pregnant. All those things are factored in. That's where you get seventy seven cents on average for the dollar that the male makes. What it implies, and this is where it's disingenuous because it two people working side by side doing the same job and the males getting 77 more a dollar for the woman's seventy seven cents. That's not what the gender pay gap actually means. And if Google is actually, if someone is saying if there's a lawsuit that's saying that a man and a woman are doing the exact same job with the exact same performance and the woman is only getting seventy seven cents on the dollar, then you got a real issue. Right?

Speaker 3:          02:24:19       Yeah. And so it's often or that you know, there's different hours worked and it doesn't even have to be that, you know, they work twice as many or 30 percent more. It's sometimes if you just work 44 hours a week versus 34 hours or something, then there's a huge, a pay disparity. Yeah. And that's irrespective of what gender you have. It's just, especially at Google, there was so much time that was just, you know, replying to email and doing some base level stuff, going to meetings and then you only had a little bit that was actually creative and providing value to the company. Really. Yeah. So it was really inefficient in that regard. Right. And you know, it's similar in a lot of companies do so and that creates some of this, you know, nonlinear, uh, benefits of working just a little more per week and you know, we see this a lot in silicon valley where there's a lot of people right out of college and they're willing to work

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       a ton of time especially, you know, you can essentially live at Google. So there's not, I mean, yeah, there's free food everywhere. There's showers, there's a gem. The beds, there is nap pods. Pods, yeah. Wow. Are they closed off? She can, can't hear anything out there. But can you actually step in there? Good. I can't really sleep in there just because I'm too tall, but most people, yeah, you can sleep in there because some they like close it off and you could just lay there. Um, is there a term for a being being discriminary discriminatory towards tall people? Yeah. Tallest. Hightest. Yeah. I just like, there's able lists, right? There's a few mock people that aren't able to do things. You become an herbalist. There's definitely a movement now of looking into. Oh, maybe tell people have some advantages because we see that a lot of ceos are over six feet tall and it's not clear why exactly that is.

Speaker 5:          02:26:20       I knew you really have to control for every aspect because there is no correlation between height and intelligence, but it's likely not just that, you know, but what I'm saying is like they're discriminating against you with the pots. Hook your fucking seven, like six, four, six, three hook you up with a six for pod man. We can stretch your legs out and get a good nap. Maybe it'd be more productive at a job you don't work out anymore. I guess I just never really felt like complaining too much. Good for you. Except for that one thing.

Speaker 5:          02:26:53       One thing. So, um, are you trying to seek other employment or are you. Yeah, I'm still looking at, you know, what exactly I want to do because I never was, you know, coding wasn't the thing that I was doing my entire life. Is that what your education is in? No, so I was doing physics and biology, random mass stuff and I just picked up some algorithm books and they seemed really cool. So I started doing some coding competitions and I did well enough that Google just like randomly contacted me. Wow. How weird. And especially since you're a white male, back in the day before they figured out discriminate here, this was all online then I had a username so maybe they didn't know. Oh, that's interesting. So they contacted you and offering you employment based on your coding skills? Yeah, that's weird. Oh, that's cool. So, um, so now you're just trying to figure out what the next. How old are you? Twenty eight. So he's telling you very young man, you got to figure out what the path is going to be. Huh? Yeah. You're leaning one way or another, uh, something that uses my brain, but yeah, that'd be nice.

Speaker 5:          02:28:09       Something outside of tech maybe or what navy or I still feel like, you know, tech in general is or the future and will have huge impact on the world. So something related to tech, but maybe not coding all day, but I really don't know because, you know, most of the major silicon valley jobs probably a blacklisted me. Really? Yeah. Wow. That's unfortunate man. Um, because like I said, I've read your memo. I don't think you did anything wrong. I think you did. You took a bold choice and a bold stance to talk about something that's essentially taboo, but you did it with science, you know, and you did it. It didn't, you didn't a very reasonable manner. You know, and I'm, I'm shocked at the reaction has been as extreme as it's been, but I'm not shocked at the same time. Right. I mean, it's predictable almost.

Speaker 5:          02:29:03       And the people calling you a massage nest. It was very weird and CEO of youtube saying it hurt her to read that, like, you're going to have a real life yet. I mean, I thought that, you know, the first, the intro which talked about all these political biases and how our culture shames people that give a different view. I thought that might have shown that, you know, maybe we shouldn't be doing that, but you know, predicted exactly what happened to me. I think very few people actually read it probably. Yeah. Yeah. Especially like globally, very few people. It's a very bad. I think, you know, the responses to it, a very click baity and people go with whatever the titles of the articles that are criticizing you and just accept that as Gospel, you know? Yeah. I've gotten a lot of responses that were just, Oh yeah, I saw it on facebook, you know, some sexist memo.

Speaker 5:          02:29:58       And it was only after they saw that so many times and they decided to read it, but they finally were like, oh no, it's not that bad. Yeah. I urge people, if you have the time, just please just read it. Just go over it and try to figure out where it all went wrong. I'm glad you did it though, man. I mean, it's a really interesting point of discussion and I hope this lawsuit works out well for you. And I helped Google just come to their senses and I don't think that's going to happen, you know? What do you predict? What do you think's going to happen?

Speaker 5:          02:30:33       I don't know. I think that people now are aware of this a lot more and there may be platforms that emerge that are sort of all tech is what they're calling it. Just alternative technology that's more open to just free speech. But unfortunately they're currently just being labeled as white supremacist sites and you know, it's, I, hopefully people can see through that. I don't know if they have the time to even look. That's the thing. It's just like they're, they're taking everyone's word for everything. It's very odd time, but there's enough people discussing it, you know, and I think your, um, the response to your memo has been, it's been very enlightening for some people from, from a sort of a psychological standpoint. Like what, what are the reactions that people have and why do they have these reactions and what is it, what does it say about us as human beings at this is such a taboo subject that we can't even address the very real differences that we have as unique individuals.

Speaker 5:          02:31:41       You know, I'm at least happy that it didn't happen during a college season is then there'd be like protests and people burning my fig years and things. So I think it would have been a much more negative if it was during the school year. Wow. And they would demand that their school, you know, double down on diversity and just all of these things. But yeah, a lot of virtue signaling going on. It's at least it's nice to see some of the colleges have been standing up for it or against it and you know, saying, no, you can't really just tell us what to do. And we believe in, you know, knowledge and actually seeking the truth and not just criticizing people based on their political ideologies. Yeah, it's a long slog. My friend. It was a lot, a lot of walking and talking and going on, but uh, I think it will be fun.

Speaker 5:          02:32:41       I hope I hope will be fine if we don't go to war with North Korea and get smashed by 100 fucking hurricanes in a row. Um, but I think we should just got to tweak that. You're a bad ass in chess. Chess master. Yeah. I played a lot of just, yeah, that, that was my life for a few years. Can you play chess in your head? Yeah. Wow. That's fascinating. I used to play chess in my head against like for different people. So like blindfolded. Whoa, dude. I knew this kid who was a chess master and a pool hall that he used to go to and he used to play with this ex con and the ex con learned how to do chest and prison, uh, in his head with no pieces and him and this kid would just sit there and play chess back and forth with each other.

Speaker 5:          02:33:31       Now what are you guys doing? How do you know where the board is? You could play it blindfolded with four people in your head. Yeah. Wow. That's intense man. How'd you learn how to do that? Just repetition over time. Yeah, doing it a lot and just obsessing over it. And this is actually one of the differences on average between men and women is there are more men that are just become obsessed with these systems and so, you know, magic. The gathering, the card game was also something that I became super obsessed with. And so the way that people approach computers too is different where you know, some are a lot of boys just approach the computer as a toy and they become obsessed with tinkering with the computer while a lot girls see it as

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       a tool for improving the world and so they may not be interested in the computer as an end to itself. And so a lot of the education programs to get more women into tech are actually addressing that. But it's unclear because so much of a coding is just, you know, writing server code and this server is going to go talk to this server which is talking to that server and it's totally unconnected to actual people and, but you know, that's why we actually see more women in front end and use your experience, um, engineering positions because it's more interactive with people. What are the numbers with women in chess? Yeah, there aren't that many. And it's unfortunate.

Speaker 1:          02:35:07       I, is it unfortunate because it's just, it is. Yeah. Yeah. I don't play chess is that unfortunately. So why is it unfortunate that women are underrepresented?

Speaker 3:          02:35:19       Well, just for the cases of maybe they feel like a minority and you a right and a lot of the mistreatment of women is not ill intentioned men that want to be sexist against men. It's just, I and I felt this a lot and you know, everyone wants a girl to play chess or play magic. The gathering, you know that that's their ideal girlfriend. So, and, but they're all nerdy guys are generally and they don't have as good social skills as the average population. And you know, they're pretty similar to the people playing or a writing code, so it's a similar situation so they just don't know how to interact with women and that causes some problems. But, so it's not the just overt sexism against women, it's more just we don't really know how to interact with women, we just, you know, we're obsessed with jazz or whatever and we just like talking about chess and there are a lot of women that just aren't as obsessed with these sort of systems. So. But I mean that's not a bad thing,

Speaker 1:          02:36:36       right? It just is what it is. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of fashion things and aesthetics thing, et Cetera, aesthetic things and design things that women are really into that a lot of men don't give a fuck about. Yeah. It's not a terrible thing that men aren't into design does not more men involved in interior design. It's not a terrible thing.

Speaker 3:          02:36:57       And that's sort of one of the unfortunate thing is too, is that there's so much fighting to get more women into tech, but there's no fighting to get more men into nursing. Right. Any of these more female dominated.

Speaker 1:          02:37:11       Do you think that's also because of the financial rewards of tech are so extreme in comparison, like nursing is pretty kept salary. Whereas if you can climb the corporate ladder as a, you know, a ceo of some sort of a tech company, the rewards are substantial.

Speaker 3:          02:37:27       Yeah. I think inevitably there will be more men attracted to high paying jobs simply because they fight for status and money is how you gain status often. So that's partly why they see tech as a target, but it's not as if nursing is a bad job that gets paid well. And there are many people that, you know, go to college for premed and dropout, like 90 percent of people that started as premed dropout. And the men feel like they can't enter nursing because that's too feminine. And there's huge biases against men becoming feminine. Like, you know, man can't wear dresses, but girls can be openly tomboyish.

Speaker 1:          02:38:10       Right? Right.

Speaker 3:          02:38:12       So there's unfortunately some asymmetries in our culture and there's reasons for it. You know, if a guy is too feminine, then he can't necessarily fulfill his gender role, which is being a provider and protector. Uh, so, you know, you have to be aggressive to be a good protector and provider for your wife. But, uh, the females gender role being a nurturer is, you know, it's fine to be feminine and so a lot of the gender disparities that we see and gender norms are just a but behind those two gender roles.

Speaker 1:          02:38:56       Yeah. I think, uh, there's a lot of evidence to support that and I think, um, that was essentially a big part of what you were talking about in your memo and I don't think you're a bad guy dude, and I think you've been unfairly maligned and uh, I'm glad we had a chance to sit down and talk and uh, and uh, I wish you well man. I hope it all works out and keep us posted and we'll let everybody else know too. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Thank you James. Appreciate it, man. Very nice to meet you. Thank you. All right folks. Say for today.

Speaker 6:          02:39:23       Bye. Bye. How long was that? Almost three hours.
