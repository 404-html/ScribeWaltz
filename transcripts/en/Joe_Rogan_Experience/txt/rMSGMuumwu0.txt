Speaker 1:          00:00:00       All Right, we're live gentlemen. What's up? Hey now, thanks for doing this. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bigger, stronger, faster. It was a, it was a documentary that I could not. Um, there was so many people that we're talking about it if you couldn't avoid like having a conversation about it, especially like in the UFC because so many fighters have been accused of taking performance enhancing drugs and there's so many conversations about that. So, uh, I always wanted to talk to you guys and I watched it again. I watched, I watched like the first half of it when it first came out and I watched it all again this morning to check it out. Just get it. Boy, you're the first time or why didn't you watch it? All the way through, but I don't remember. I think it was on a plane and I think the plane probably landed and I shut my laptop and I never picked it up again.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       It was one of those things. Yeah. What'd you think of it? It's great. Great Documentary and interesting and honest. It was really hilarious when you're going over the, uh, people that like what's the number one reason to go to the hospital and then they're like, aspirin, fucking vitamin C and then below that with steroids and then steroids was way down. I think the amount of deaths, it's like steroids deaths or like slightly above water drinking water. There's no, there's no real proof to link to link anything scientifically, you know, you can have a anecdotal evidence on a lot of things, but nothing scientifically links steroids that these deaths, this is a real problem with some people. They don't want to hear that and they did. They don't want to hear it because they don't. There's like a, there's a narrative that we're being taught in this country or that we're being told to embrace that narrative is steroids are for cheaters and cheaters, losers and losers on American.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       But as you highlighted in your movie over and over and over again, all these examples of different athletes that were caught with performance enhancing drugs was the guy from the Tour de France, whether it was Carl Lewis, the Carlos thing was fucking hilarious because a lot of people don't know when Ben Johnson got tested positive for steroids, they stripped him of his metal. Carl Lewis tested positive for amphetamines. Yeah. It wasn't supposed to run. So that's the whole thing is crazy. I mean, they're all doped up, but like you said about the narrative that they want you to believe the narrative doesn't come from health problems. The narrative comes from, you know, nobody's concerned about the health of the athlete. We say that, uh, but nobody really concerned about the health of the athlete. They're concerned about an unfair advantage. Yeah. They're concerned about someone being able to do what we suspected the Russians were doing back in the fifties.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       And that was really enlightening to when you were talking to that guy that was saying that they, they had found out about it from the Russians doing it at 19 fifties. And from then on they were doping and over shots of vodka, they were actually hanging out with the Russian strength coach and he was, you know, a little loose, loosey Goosey and he sort of slipped up and it's like, yeah, we're given our guys testosterone. So as soon as I got out of the bag Dr Ziglar raced home and he created Diana Ball, which was even a stronger steroid then was currently available on the market and they started testing guys with like five milligrams of Diana Ball. And of course they found other ways to get it through the testing facility or however they were getting their hands on it once it was manufactured. And that's when it became the wild west.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       Basically. It was like people started taking 20 milligrams and getting way stronger. And it's kind of crazy because if you know, if you want to get better at something, people don't have a problem with people using certain means where people don't have problem with someone to go into a supplement store and purchasing something that doesn't work. But as soon as you take something that's powerful, people are like, well, wait a second. We don't want you to doing that. Good. I was always tell people the strongest shit I ever took. They made illegal but used to be able to buy the GNC. It was called Mag 10. Do you remember that snow? Yeah, totally. Yeah. Oh my God. That stuff. I took that shit for like whatever it was like six weeks. I gained like 10 pounds. I was jacked up all the time. It was like a bunch of pills.

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       You have to take like 10 pills. And after it was over, my Dick died. Like it got hit with a media was useless. It was useless. The thing is, it took me for my testosterone to come back and it's like, oh, this is steroids. Like real steroids. You could buy a GNC. They made it illegal. Those drugs are more dangerous than the actual real testosterone and all kinds of stuff to the fuck was in danger. I just bought it because it was legal. Probably a lot of sodium, a lot of those pills. Uh, what they do is they'll give you a, a huge surge of estrogen as well for the girl to now they did. And I got lucky, but you know, that's what one of the guys was on the US power lifting team with, uh, Bruce Jenner thinks happened to gender and he believes that.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       Well, first of all he said he knows that they had gender pumped full of steroids. He said we were all on steroids. He goes, Jana was absolutely pumped full of steroids. And he said that was what started his transition. This is where I'm heading. Maybe if you drop off a little bit to stay on dude, you know, that's, that's interesting. But mark and I had this talk the other day and I think that, um, this whole like gender issue and transgender and all these different things like, I don't know how much that's linked to testosterone levels are not like that. I don't know the, if there's that many definitive studies on like whether your testosterone, like if you have a high estrogen level, just because somebody is going to be trained, they don't have testosterone levels. Yeah, there's a lot of people that are gay that are very high testosterone.

Speaker 1:          00:05:07       Later, people can kick ass to there. Okay. But, but those are gay. They're not, they don't identify as female that there is a difference. I don't know how that actually correlates. I haven't read the studies on that stuff, but I think it's probably, it's difficult for us to understand as to understand what it's like to be a woman. It's like, it's like you don't get it. You don't get any. Like, like they probably don't get what it's like to not want to be a woman right now. You're like, ah, I'm good. He's like, are you sure you don't want to be a woman? Like, I'm good, I'm good.

Speaker 1:          00:05:38       Well, good luck. And the power lifting world, uh, in the, you know, the world power lifting, it's been sort of turned on its ear by a guy named Matt Kroc is that. It's ski marks can tell you a little bit more about him. But uh, he had been friends with him for about a decade. Um, I've known about his issue for about six or seven years now and he's actually going to on my show coming up soon, but you know, he's a transgender and he's, you know, it's ruined relationships for them many times over. He's got three kids, he's a good father, he's a good person, he's a good dude or female. That's good woman. She's a good woman. Um, but uh, you know, the issue is, is really interesting and that's why I want to like talk to him and try to help people just better understand it because people get so mad.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       That's the thing I don't get as he is a, I do understand voicing your opinion and saying, fuck man, that's weird. Like, that makes sense to me. But people actually getting mad and having a committing hate crimes and stuff. To me it's just disgusting. I don't, I don't, I'm not on board with that. Yeah, it is disgusting and I just, I got to think that it comes from their family, from the way they're raised by their parents are ignorant. That's the only thing that makes any sense. I just think that we're moving past that. I think there's more awareness and more acceptance for those sorts of issues that people have, that every country worries about. Some fucked up shit. There's a lot worse going on. Steroids, who cares everyday, everyday. Another cop shooting somebody and we're worried about concerned ourselves so much more with the tabloid media than we do with the, with what's really going on in this country.

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       Well, the cops shooting part, you know, it's a horrible thing, but cops on steroids is something that people don't talk about too much. Uh, it's kind of hilarious when you see cops busting people for steroids because we all know anybody who knows people that take steroids knows that cops are on steroids. Absolutely. Giant chunk of them and busted our brother would steroids and they're probably on it when they were busted and confiscated every cop in poughkeepsie where we're from, got huge. They had, they took like a thousand pills, a Diana ball from him. And next thing you know that cops are walking around all jack. Well, they had A. I had talked to a guy who was a cop I used to workout with and he had a rational explanation. He's like, look man. He goes, it's fucking gross out there. He goes, it's dangerous as fuck and you got to be on top of your game and you want to have an edge.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       Right? Meanwhile, dude was five slash 70 weight to 50. I'm like, you've got a couple of edges, edges all over your body, so fucking jacked. That's how do you even move like that? That's not very well. Well, someone would have to do is get ahold of him and hang on. You got to do with a guy like that as ride the bull will send them. Look, if you taught those guys what you know in Jujitsu, they'd be much more effective than taking steroids, but that's probably the easier route. Right? I would help, but the real. The reality is you're dealing with guns and knives and shit like that. No matter how big you are, it doesn't even really matter, right? No. You definitely should know how to defend yourself physically. One hundred percent. Every cop should be a black belt in something, you should know what it's like to be in a wild melee with another person who's trying to kill you with their hands, but that's not going to protect you from guns and knives and all that and gun defense stuff like that's, that's an art in and of itself.

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       Like, you know, there's some guys who are experts in guns away from people and Shit. But good luck with all the major differences between like UFC and pride. Pride. I don't think they really had rules. Right. They definitely had rules. They had no elbows and that was just mentioned testing wise. Oh, testing wise. Yeah. No, they didn't have rules at all. In fact, they specifically said on their contracts that there was no, no test steroids. Uh, ensign. Anyway. Who's one of the fighters from pride? Great guy fought in UFC as well. He, um, he did this whole thing about it where he came on the podcast and explain like the verbatim contract. It said we are not going to test. You forced her meaning like, go ahead and do your thing. Yeah. Well, they encouraged it, buddy of mine who was, he would fight in America, American one 70 and they wanted him to fight in Japan.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       He went over there and had some meetings that you'll one 85 and he's like, but I don't wave one any five. I weigh 180 right now. Is acknowledged this throats again wit like they were like really sold on him being one of the five. They wanted big Americans. They wanted everyone to look like Mark Kerr. Remember my. It was amazing as smashing machine. That's smashing machine as a documentary filmmaker. That was my favorite documentary. I think the sale is to we ever. It's an amazing documentary and for folks who don't know what it's about, it's about Mark Kerr who was at the time one of the most dangerous mma fighters and more like a guy who you would look at and you'd say, well that is what an MMA fighter should look like. Two hundred 60 pounds fucking Jack to the tits. Just giant and smashing people.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       But they caught him. There he is right there at his prime. What a fucking shit man. Yeah, that's a good picture. They caught him right when he slid. They caught. They literally caught him on top before he'd slipped and then went into this mad fucking painkiller slide. Absolutely. It happens to everybody. I mean that's what happened in the world of pro wrestling, which were like really closely associated with all these guys. You didn't hear about the wrestlers dying and everything. It's not necessarily the steroids, it's a deadly cocktail that they're all doing it. Steroids are a big part of it, but that's the steroids. It's tiny in comparison to the head injured is important to point out that, that they're not safe. You know, like I think sometimes people that take them are like, fuck yeah man, take steroids. They definitely have their, their drawbacks and there are definitely, it's a drug and it's an illegal drug, you know, so that always needs to be done dose.

Speaker 1:          00:11:12       It's well, right. You know, there's people that are gonna take a little bit and be fine or there's people that are going to go off the rails and like there was a dude that we knew that was a detour Belfort's trainer in the nineties and he died really young. She died like 32 or 33. We used to call them garden hoses because he would work out. He would be purple and it's fucking arms veins. Curtis left purple. Yeah. They call him, call the Barney at the gym. They'd call him Barney because they're so purple. He was nicest guy. The sales guy. Really great guy. And um, and veto or at the time was Jack Jack. He was training at golds Venice. He almost got to Jack Memory, came in, smoked everybody. Then all of a sudden he got like kind of too big. When he fought randy, he was too big and it was like 2:40 when he fought randy and he had no gas tank.

Speaker 1:          00:11:57       He was using specimen when he was younger. When he was 19, when he was 200 pounds. He was like the perfect size because Vito has like a size eight foot. He's not a big guy like his hands are fairly small too, but he's just a spectacular athletes. It's amazing. He's done it for so long and believable. I know it is and it's. It's a really. It's an interesting point because v tour for the last year and a half was on testosterone replacement last like two years and had the most spectacular results of his career. It was really crazy to see a guy who had been fighting since 1997 in the UFC and he's knocking out Michael Bisping. He's knocked out Luke rockhold, Dan Henderson. He's we'll kicking people in the head with the way he was doing. It was just fucking crazy to watch. He had kicked three of the best fighters in the world and did it with muscles grown out of his fucking teeth mean just legal in the UFC was legal.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       It's honestly therapeutic use then. Yeah, but now it's a lot of came in and went, Whoa, hold the fuck up. What's going on here? First of all, they had guys. There were guys that were in their twenties that had been prescribed it for. Yeah. And they're like, well, what happened? Why do you have a load test? And most of them it's because the steroid use and we all know that there's a way of manipulating those tests and maybe some are overtrained not sleeping well on top of 100 percent. And if you don't think those tests get manipulated into like what you'd need to do in bigger, stronger, faster. I show you how to get human growth hormone and basically, you know, go to your doctor and do this and that. And the way that you take the test was you had to like pee in this bag basically all day long.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       And then you take a sample of that urine. Uh, but you know, the way that I did it was I only, I only took the urine from like two samples that were taken at night when your growth hormone is the lowest. So my growth hormone looked like it came from a guy who's 125 years old. They're like, oh my God, you have no growth when I'm on your ticket in the morning. It would have and balance it out with during the day would have been normal. It would have been normal, but it was really low, so I just wanted the doctor to give me growth hormone to see if they would do it for the movie. Well, the also they say if you eat a very large fatty meal like cheeseburgers and fries and shit, like a big burger, like right before you take the test, like within an hour, the test shit just plummets.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       Your test plummets, your growth plummets. Everything just goes, oh, there's, there's ways to beat all these tests. Even even the guys that are beating the test, uh, to compete. Lance Armstrong, all these guys are strong lies. A good documentary too. Saw that was fucking incredible. Well, Jeff, mind boggling. The guy who busted Lance Armstrong is going to be on my podcast next week. I fucking can't. I had a great comment. He, the UFC, hired him to try to clean up the sport. I don't know what it's like going to a hoarder's house like you need to hire. The other guy will eat off this floor, hire a Ferrari guy. The guy that was the Lance Armstrong coach I was trying to do, no matter what you do, the cheaters will always be ahead

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       of the guys that are trying to catch them. It's just a cat and mouse game. It's been going on forever. Yeah, well they were kind of ahead. Now what they're doing now is they're, you know, the way they make testosterone. Apparently they do something with yams. That's how they make it. Do you know the Mexican Wild Yams? Yeah. Well now do that thing where it's derived from or something. Yeah. Well now they figured out how to do it with animals and they have made a bioidentical testosterone that's. You can't differentiate. We just spoke about a stem cells. Now, stem cells aren't going to be a human, but stem cells are going to allow you a Vito Belfort right now. Now that he can't do the testosterone replacement, he gets stem cells done to all of his existing injuries. You know, he basically got a clean slate and he's, and he's back to normal.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       I know where to draw the line. I guess built over time, you know, a baseball pitcher can pitch 10 more years. How, how is, how is that going to affect the future of sports with the records and all these things like who can hit the most home runs and who can, you know, play the longest and all you need. It's like there's a word that's a banned word. Steroids is like, you know, it's, it's a, it's a negative word. My word will never be polished up. Granted me and it's like the Barry Bonds Shit with mark mcgwire all over Congress. By the way. That was one of my favorite parts of the documentary was watching those dummies in Congress. It was amazing to see. And Joe Biden talk about memory when I was a good athlete. I thought at the fuck you were, you were never a good athlete.

Speaker 2:          00:16:18       I would like to that sir. They took it away from me and it wasn't by God given talent, like third string baseball player, like community college, whatever he was save it, but whatever. He was just shut your mouth. Yeah, exactly. The thing was like, they bring up these baseball players and string them up before Congress. It becomes this huge media circus. Everybody loves to see that. I'll look at their, you know, they're pointing out all these guys and they're the bad guys and you have guys like Mark Maguire up there looking like mark McGuire said, steroids is bad. It's a bad message. Don't do them. It's like, this is people. These are, these are these heroes too. These kids up there that are completely looking like idiots and there's a better way to handle it, you know? Well, it just seemed really frivolous that they were in front of Congress for the.

Speaker 2:          00:17:06       They're getting too good at hitting the ball with the stick. We need to bring in all our leaders. Right? Same. That doesn't even seem real. It seems like a good plot in the movie. Even in swimming, they made suits a few years ago. They got rid of them right away. It's a speedo company made a suit that makes you swim faster and as soon as they did that they were like, Whoa, we don't want you to swim in that fast. So they got rid of them. So it was like a body suit, like your whole body as the body suit. So like a wetsuit. Yeah, I think it helped increase like buoyancy a little bit and just helped you kind of glide through the pool faster. That's pretty dope. We're got one of those. Well I guess the, the issue with it was a, it's expensive and so they were like, oh, it might price some people out of it or whatever. I was like, I don't really even understand what that is.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       All these sports end up being pretty expensive. Come on man. The amount of money that's involved in training for the Olympics for swimming, things that are going on now with training are insane. You know, I did my second film, did a movie called trophy kids and it's about parents that push their kids in sports and that was on hbo and the thing that is so crazy now is the way that parents have access to all these things we didn't have, like you'll go to a, you know, a, a baseball camp and they have like this Nike makes his hand eye coordination thing that you wouldn't believe how it tells you, like, what position your kid should play. It tells you, you know, and, and parents are actually going and getting genetic testing on their kid. They swab the inside of their kids a cheek and they send it off to this company and it, it'll tell the parent what sports.

Speaker 3:          00:18:33       The kid will be good at. This one, they're like an infant. So there's some crazy stuff going on where, where, uh, you know, technology is far exceeding like, you know, what we've been able to do before. That's fucking madness. Robbing your kids, cheat to find out what sport they should do. Well, there's a, there's a um, California cryobank. It's like a sperm bank and it's a at Ucla. Don't get that infused with getting frozen into the fuck the therapy. Arthritis. Wow. Great job. Joe Rogan was fucking shit. Tastes great. Anyway, you can get, um, it actually shows a guy on HBO, Real Sports. He goes in and basically like they custom order their kid and it's like this fat, what the hell? It's like this fat Mexican guy. He goes in and he says, I want a kid just like me, blue eyes, blonde hair and big calves.

Speaker 3:          00:19:33       And it's like he looks nothing like the guy. So it's not his sperm as someone is using a sperm donor because he couldn't get his wife pregnant and they decide, well we want our kid to be. The father is similar, similar to similar to me, you know, like athletic and outgoing and you know, so they picked a six, two blonde haired blue eyed kid with a. and it actually says on the application, huge gaps, huge calves on the application. What the fuck they, they, the California cryobank goes out and they recruit players. Uh, I went to USC. So I know it goes on at USC, they go out and recruit players to make extra money. You can make 900 bucks a month or something jerking off in a cup and basically selling it to my parents. It's a good deal. Bad deal. If you have rent, you gotta pay it somehow. Spring might be tainted probably. Yeah. They don't need to know that. It's amazing. It's an amazing phenomenon to see parents now getting into like, how am I going to help my kid sheet? Well, it's getting to the point also where they're within a few years. Have you heard of Crispr? Do you know what Crispr is? No. There's a radio lab documentary they did on it. It's a or a radio lab episode rather. It's all about um, this new tool that they have for

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       engineering genetics and for splicing genes and for adding traits or subtracting traits. And you know, you, you showed him the documentary, the milestone and hypocrisies of doing with these cows that make these cows grow enormous amounts of muscle. Well, they're going, first of all, they could do it now to pigs and they're going to be able to do it to people. It's just a matter of when she's used to be in a year. Is it going to be in a decade? It's going to happen. If we live another 100 years of human beings survive 100 years and the asteroids don't blow us up or we don't get hit by a fucking nuke. We're gonna have myostatin inhibited people that it looked like the hall that's fucking crazy and it's going to be nuts and they're going to live longer. That's what's even more fucked up. What do you think about steroids in the UFC?

Speaker 1:          00:21:29       Like what's your take on it? Do you think they should be illegal or monitored or. Well, I think she's gonna be a moot point once you get to genetic engineering and I think ultimately what steroids are, is it's a form of engineering. It's a form of biological engineering. You're taking these substances and you're adding people, but as you pointed out in your, in your documentary, look at the guy who was the, uh, the, the Tour de France guy that had this oxygen tent, these hyperbaric chamber to Chambers, hyperbaric chambers. What I do all the time, the cryogenic freezing tanks, all that shit is cheating. I mean, if you really want to look at it, I take trt, I'd take human growth hormone. If I was competing in a somewhere that wouldn't let me take that, that would be considered cheating. But for life, like I'm like, look, if you're 48 years old and you're not taking testosterone, what do you hate?

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       Life. You'd hate having energy started throwing it away. Like your immune system sucks. You want to feel better, look better. Your body works better. It's all about simple. Optimizing what you already are. And I think when people go beyond that, that's when it becomes into like, okay, well that it's cheating. I don't know why people think that, but that's what it is. It's like, you know, if you say, well, I'm on trt, nobody really cares. You know? And the same commercials for tea, our tea, I don't know if you noticed, but during the world series, the same sport that they condemn for steroids during the commercial break, the first commercial. Do you have low t? Yeah. No, that's the very first commercial. Hilarious. I think that the issue with steroids also for a lot of people is they believe that it's going to get kids into them and that the kids are gonna get sick or they're going to get hurt or they're gonna commit suicide.

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       Like the guy in the documentary had. He was convinced that his kid who we had on Lexapro, who was a teenager, you know what I mean? He was convinced that with steroids that made this kid commit suicide and steroids very well may have played a factor. Abuse of anything is bad. Whether it's abuse of alcohol, there's a lot of different drugs, painkillers that you can abuse that'll make you suicidal. Abuse of anything is bad. So to blame it on one thing that guy had this blanket thought in his mind, he's just going to throw a blanket over the problem. The problem with steroids, I don't even think you can blame it on the Lexapro. There's a deeper issue going on with the, with the child takes his own life. He had, he certainly had some issues and he also didn't want to communicate with his parents these issues too much and the

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       going on with that story that I put in the movie and that was to protect the company's gone. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody loses a child. I don't want to go into a family history and all these other things that we found out. Um, but yeah, it's definitely hard for you for doing that. That's a, they gave his father a million dollars to go in front to, to continue this education to continue a lying to people basically. Well that makes sense because that's why he had this thought in his head, like he wouldn't even consider the fact that these kids are on psychoactive drugs and he would. Those had nothing to do with the fact that his brain was fucked up. Like, come on man, I got to know. You don't know. Those drugs are, are dangerous to anybody. There's a hundred years, 100 million people walking around on psych meds and there's really no proof that they actually work.

Speaker 2:          00:24:36       There's really no scientific proof that they improve any sort of a problem with. Is that true though? Because they definitely do help some people. I think they definitely helped some people, but there's actually nothing. There's no, you know, if you're looking at, you can look at a, like I said, anecdotal evidence for anything. I took this and I got bigger. I got stronger, um, scientific proof now because there's no real markers in the brain. There's no test I can give you to see if you feel better. Right. There's no depression tests. Exactly. I think, yeah, that's the issue there, but there is, there's a lot of evidence that Ssri helped improve mood. Right? And they do, yeah. Yeah. But there's also a, a. While they improve mood and some people, a lot of people commit suicide on them because they are so low down. Like you'll see a person that's like severely severely depressed.

Speaker 2:          00:25:22       They can't even get out of bed to kill themselves. And then they put them on an Ssri and now they haven't just enough energy to say fuck it, you know, that's what's so crazy. Also with steroids though, when you know that kid, he just stopped cold Turkey, you know, he stopped the steroids right away and then uh, went on those other drugs, but stopping him, as you mentioned earlier, like if you're 48 years old, you want to get the energy boost from. I'm just like coming off, I'm actually a puts you at a lower state than you ever were before. So with that kid coming off him, his testosterone levels are probably low. Is estrone levels probably came up. It's probably just insanely depressed. That does get you depressed. And that's a big issue with fighters and football players and people that have had a lot of head injuries.

Speaker 2:          00:26:05       Dr Mark Gordon, who was in your documentary for a brief amount of time, I saw his face in there. He works with a lot of traumatic brain injury people. And one of the things that he finds them, they almost all have low testosterone. Sure. Something about getting the pituitary gland rattled. Whether it's through an IED or football collisions or head kicks, whatever the fuck it is. Almost all of those guys have low testosterone. They just like super. It's almost like getting kicked in the balls. You ever posed the question to this athlete, a Nevada state athletic commission, you know, the, uh, all these guys are getting pounded in the head and the UFC, they can, they get punched a lot. They get kicked a lot. Um, had head trauma is a on the job injury, but you're not allowed to treat. And on the job

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       injury with something that works like human growth hormone, like you'll talk to mark Gordon, he'll tell you one of the best things they can do to treat these concussions and traumatic brain injuries is to supplement with human growth hormone. So you can't treat those injuries. You can get them. And if you're a normal everyday person you can be treated, but you can't be treated if you are a fighter or if you're an athlete, you know. And if there's a thing with fighters as well, now they're not allowing them to use ivs to rehydrate. And the reason why is because ivs and use of ivs can mask some of the signs of steroids, so something that was ultimately very beneficial. Now you can't use because people can use it to cheat. So even though it's just to rehydrate you and even if they can prove that it's just rehydrating you, they can, you can't use it because it could be something that you're doing because you're actually probably healthier for the fighter like a day before to have all those electrolytes in them and everything.

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       And I'm right. I mean rather than fight completed as soon as you're cutting weight. Yeah, that's the argument. But there's some arguments. Some people, I don't know if it's, I haven't researched it, but there's some people that say that it's actually more effective to rehydrate orally. I've heard that's bullshit. I've heard that's true. I don't know what's right. I'd have to talk to an expert about that. So do a google lead hard. It's hard to be a, it's hard to be way on top of all that though. Like when you're, um, these, these fighters, they travel, you know, in power lifting. We do the same thing, we use ivy bags, so to rehydrate and guys we'll do 30 pound weight cuts and stuff like that. So you do 30 pound weight cuts so that you competed a lower level to power lift. Yeah, lighter weight classes.

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       You're not getting hit in the head though, the right. The rehydration orally. If it's not effective as if you. If you fight in a dehydrated state and you get rattled, your brain bleeds. Right. I say that almost all the deaths and pro boxing, almost all of them were in the lighter weight divisions. Wow. Even though the heavyweights hit hardest, they didn't cut weight so they didn't have all that same problem. Is there any rules in UFC about cutting weight? How much percentage cut there should be? If you can make the way you can fight, you just have to make the weight. Four o'clock on Friday and then Saturday, you know whenever your fight is the fight, don't start till four. Do you think this thing will change the game? I hope it does. I also think the UFC probably is going to have to add more weight classes eventually because there's not enough way classes.

Speaker 1:          00:28:55       There's some big gaps between like one 85 and two. Oh five. That's 20 pound weight class. That's a giant gap. No, I think that for fighters that are like tweeners, you know, there's guys that are like a little bit too big for this way, but a little bit too small for that weight. They could use a one 95. I think every 10 pounds we've saved like be an advantage to actual, you know, to the fans and need to be more, more champions, more championship fights, more money and then also the, there could be some reasonable like a champion versus champion. Like one 95 versus two. Oh, five was pretty reasonable. Whereas like one 85 versus two. Oh five. Like massive, big fucking jump for those guys. I think to answer your question about steroids in the UFC, I think we have to kind of define. I think the real problem is what we said earlier that the word steroid is it, it's like

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       did it's a dirty word, but if it's far as like supplements are supplements be legal Kinda. Everybody says supplements, illegal. Fuck. We have muscle farm that sponsors the UFC. They sell a ton of Shit and supposed to help you recover. And protein powders. All this jazz. Think about creatine. Absolutely. Clinically proven to enhance performance. There's a lot of stuff that you can get that's legal. Even caffeine. Yeah, absolutely. It's all stuff that gives you like a very slight bump. I'm very slight edge and then taken all together synergistically. Like we'll supplement like says your diet. So if you have a, you know, a diet where you're not getting enough stuff in it. Like I was just reading this, I posted something on facebook the other day and people went crazy because I posted this thing about fish oil and the effect that it's officially not being really scientifically proven.

Speaker 2:          00:30:27       You know, it's like if you eat fish twice a week, then you don't need it. You know, and everybody goes crazy. No, I need it. And people, people are convinced the supplement industry is a $20 million up fish oil. I'm convinced to that I need to have 20 pills a day. It's a $24, billion dollar industry and people are convinced that they need these things. You know, there's some science behind fish oil and Krill oil though. Especially the anti inflammatory process. The inflammatory at a. At a high dose. Yes. Yeah. That's what I do. I take a lot official. It makes sense for that for if you're trying to prevent heart disease and all these things like that. They're saying that, you know, there's really. The link isn't there and if you eat fatty fish you'll probably get enough in your diet. Really good fish like salmon that's high in those healthy fats.

Speaker 2:          00:31:09       They're actually. Yeah. Everybody should eat that like once or twice a week for Sushi. Yeah. I mean I believe I, you know, I'll read, I'll read all this shit about supplements, right? All this stuff. I'll read like okay this doesn't work at this barely works and whatever. And the next thing I do, I go open up my cabinet and I take 20 pills because like, because it doesn't fucking work, I don't know. I mean it's like that placebo effect is really, really strong and you know, certain things I take because I. Oh, I heard this works for, you know, Alpha lipoic acid when you eat carbs that will help shuttle it in your muscles. Will do. I know that that even works like, I don't know, Philip Polk assets supposed to be clinically proven, isn't it? I think there's studies on Alpha lipoic acid studies on everything. Then you get into like the whole thing, it's, oh, it's an antioxidant.

Speaker 2:          00:31:50       And you're like, well, wait a second. What the fuck's an antioxidant? What do I need? Why do I need it? You know, like you, you forget even why you needed to have certain berries. They're like the best antioxidant and birds and birds. And then they find out there's studies that say that eating antioxidants in your diet doesn't really matter. It doesn't translate into antioxidants in the bloodstream and all this stuff like that. So you gotta look at it like they say you need certain precursors to be able to digest these things. So ice cream too fucking complicated. You need to be your own doctor and I need to do your own research. I find I get big benefits when I eat a lot of vegetables. I feel a big benefit when I drink like these Kale shakes the cow. No, I thought you were a tough guy. It's healthy now. He just makes fun of cattle. The time I was making fun of

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       one of my friends because he's like, he's like, I went over here and I had a Kale Salad is super skinny. I'm like, dude, a Kale Salad. Come on, just make up a lie. Say That you had a fucking 20 ounce ribeye. Well you could have both. I just think in general that's way to go. Like you know, we need, we need vitamins and vitamins and minerals and we need all these things in our diet. And so vegetables are probably the most abundant source of great nutrients in vegetables and fruits and things like that. So like, why wouldn't you eat them like it seems like it's, I feel different when I eat them when I have one of those Kale shakes with giant clumps of fucking ginger in it and four cloves of garlic and an apple and celery. It's amazing. Cucumber could feel like fucking superman.

Speaker 1:          00:33:18       You got to choke it down, tastes like shit. But when you choking it down once, once you get it in, you're like, whoo, you feel like you kinda like a double shot of espresso, but you don't, you don't feel like jittery. He just feel like crap. I remember talking to you about. Um, uh, it was kind of amazing and it was kind of a good example for me talking to you about like you were talking about going on the road and traveling and you said, Oh man, I need to find a whole foods. I don't eat that process shit. And like to me that was like a real eyeopener to find that. Like somebody as busy as yourself goes out of their way to find like good healthy food and yeah. And it's probably more important almost for him because he's on a plane or in a car or some shit all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:33:56       It's just you can only go so many. I always bring a vitamin packs of those pure athlete packs I bring with me to supplement when I'm on the road, I always make sure you get a lot of salads. Like I get salads before every meal, whatever I'm eating. I eat salads first. But it's hard. It's hard to find, you know, food that's not just full of garbage and contaminated. It is. Yeah. I mean like you go to subway, I mean, yeah, you get bread and there's an there and you kind of can fill you up. But like, you know, all the different preservatives and nonsense and process bullshit. Fucking kills your stomach. All the gluten. Oh, it's Chris's girlfriend eats tons of vegetables and Cece, she's a super hot. So maybe that's the formula. Yeah, we can all be super hot chicks if Bruce Jenner had only known about the Kale Salad, the um, but the key, the key, like you said, is good nutrition, good solid things in your diet.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       I think when you're dealing with things like UFC fighters, you're dealing with a level of performance that they're requiring of their body. That's so extreme because even boxers like the average boxer, they do their boxing workout. They'll spar a couple of times a week depending upon the philosophy of the camp. In the morning. They usually run like maybe they'll have a strength and conditioning session instead of a run, but they're doing two workouts a day and one of them is pretty mild. It's not that big a deal, so they're, you know, they can get through six to eight week camp and most likely they never pull out of fights. It's very rare that a championship fight, manny Pacquiao almost pulled out a floyd mayweather fight because he apparently tours from, but he wound up fighting. Now there's a lawsuit because we pushed through the injury.

Speaker 1:          00:35:31       Jesus, you hear about all that. Different people are suing them because they bet a lot of money on them. They didn't know that his right shoulder fucked up and he had surgery right after the fight, but for the UFC fucking 20 percent of the fights fall apart at least. And guys fight injured all the time. Even conor mcgregor when he fought against Chad Mendez after, although pulled out a fight, mcgregor been getting stem cell shots in his knee. He was fucked. Jason, he was thinking he couldn't, he didn't wrestle the entire camp because he was thinking there's no way because like I can't, it'll fall apart. Was a good fight. Grateful that was good. It's to be the toughest sport. I mean, I'd say that thing, so people go like, oh, basketball players are the best athletes or these guys are the best athletes. I just think that, uh, the amount of maybe genetically basketball, you know, but the amount of effort it takes to step into the octagon, the amount of mental focus, it's like, to me that's amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:36:18       It's like family. I agree by it. Basketball I think has the best six foot six athletes. Yeah. Well fighting is not made up. It's something that is part of us. Everything else is made up. Football, basketball, baseball, made up, sports. You know, when it came along we were like, this is the only sport. To me that makes sense. It really makes sense. It's like, but the movements and the art are all made up. Had to figure out what's the most effective way of striking and I don't want to fuck someone up the fastest. All of that is where the sport lies, but I think you're right about the level of athlete when you see the guys that played for the NFL. I mean those are fucking super freak motherfuckers. Will you come in in the UFC soon? I'm sure. Well, if the money becomes right, that's Jon Jones.

Speaker 1:          00:37:00       Jon Jones could have probably opted to go and play in the NFL. One hundred percent. One hundred percent. His brothers both do. He could have. What's crazy is he's not even the toughest one in his family. Both his brothers said they kick his ass. His younger brother and his older brother. That's crazy fucked up family is that one of the guys got drafted. One of his brothers got drafted. I saw him a thermal jumping on each other and shit. They're all kicking the shit out of each other. I was like, Jesus Christ, a lot of shit. Must've got broken in the house. Oh yeah. I think that's why it happened and that's why he came out so bad ass and not afraid of anything about genetics. I mean like that family, the manning family, like because these families are just incredible. Yeah. Genetics and that goes a long way. Oh, 100 percent.

Speaker 1:          00:37:37       Everything we're talking about, you know, Matt Hughes, a former UFC welterweight champion, his brother, his twin, it looks exactly like them their entire lives. They beat the fuck out of each other. So of course he gets to the UFC with his fucking steely eyed gaze. He's used to facing himself literally like a mirror version of him beating the fuck out of him his whole life. Just smashing each other, running through walls, like juggernaut summit, sparring partner. That's what I used to pick people up and slam them. Yeah, there's a. his brother's bigger. Wow. His brothers to 65, Jesus Christ, his brothers talking all kinds of shit that he would, uh, he would kick his brother's ass. I think Jon Jones could probably get up to that way. Right? I mean, he's probably fighting this whole life, so we'll. Chandler I think is a bigger guy, but he's just an inch tall.

Speaker 1:          00:38:20       Two brothers in the NFL, right? Yeah. Arthur to his brother, arthur is even bigger than chandler. His brother Arthur is more than 300 pounds. Man, that's a super athlete family. His Dad's a patient due to his dad is just naturally did very gifted. It's, it's taken a long time for the sport to evolve to where it is. Um, you know, like I'm, I'm interested to see what will happen with the female division. You know, like Rhonda is just killing everybody and she's obviously amazing, but I don't think the girls have caught up to where the guys are at. No, not yet. But have you seen a yawning and jet check? The strawweight champion? Do you think Ronda is impressive? This bitches, ruth, she's from Poland 1:15, six time world Moy Thai champion. The way we did it, that was a fight companion one, right? We watched that girl get busted up.

Speaker 1:          00:39:06       Jessica Pinay. Oh my God. Do you use the ugliest female fight I've ever seen in my life? This girl's nose was smashed. A giant gash across her nose and this is Yolana chick from Poland was just beating the fuck out of her. I was literally to the point where you're watching it like saying, please stop this fight. This fight is a terrible mismatch like that. That chick is lethal cause like when Rhonda beats chicks up like she knocked out batch with one punch and most of the time she flips chicks on their back and arm bars. I'm in the first round. This bitch beats the fuck out of checks for like four rounds. That's got to be cool. Call that stuff because I saw your excitement and it was like so genuine. You know, you're so pumped to call that fight. Ronda fight. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:49       It was a. You know those. You could feel it though when you watch it. It was a piece of history. I felt. It felt like a. I feel like where she's at right now, it's just so strange and rare. It's like, it's not just calling a fight. It's like I feel like I'm calling a piece of human history in modern day. Mike Tyson. She, yeah. She's like a real Charlie's angels character. Like there's never been like a hot chick that actually can fuck up a lot of dudes. So it has been faking a movie. Okay. There's wonder woman changing, you know, it's like fake. Someone was pounding on your door. They'd like 2:00 in the morning like what the fuck? And you open up the door and it was Ronda rousey angry. You'd be like, Oh shit, your heart would drop you like, this bitch is going to beat my ass right now to get my sleep or something.

Speaker 1:          00:40:32       She was outside. She could, you know, break in your house. You could kick your ass. Like that's real. And her confidence is through the roof. That's just saw something today where she's like, can you beat floyd mayweather in a fight or whatever? And she's like, yeah, and I know rules fight. I could beat anybody. Well, she said, I'm not in a boxing match. He's like, he's a boxer. I'm sure he would beat me in a boxing match. She goes, but I don't have matches. I have fights. Right. You know, she's just letting them know. She would ask. She got ahold of him. He's going flying, that's for sure. There's no way he's going to be able to understand what she's doing. If he tied up with her, he really, he, he'd have so much to think about it. I'm sure she trained with guys all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       I've seen her but been there in the gym with her flipping guys and I've seen her tap guys. I've seen it with my own eyes. Tap good guys. Get them an arm bars. There's a video of her with a and trying and try. It was a video with her with Luke rockhold and you know Luke, let's or get into a position, but she finishes them. You know Luke rockhold fucking giant is big fights at one 85 cuts, a lot of weight to get down there. Something. He's strong. He's a stud and she finished him with an arm bar. I'm like, Whoa,

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       it's not even embarrassing. She's the fucking best. She's pretty Goddamn with it. But was like, what about steroids and that division with the issue that I talk about Cyborg. You got guys like, I know you talk about it a lot in your podcasts. You get into um, steroids here and there and um, you know, a lot of guys don't eat. They don't even look like they're doing it like Gilbert Melendez or hoists Gracie, you know, it's like you can't tell anymore. Well, voice actually did look like he was doing it when he got popped. When you got pop. We were there for that fight and I was there with my friend Eddie, Eddie Bravo, and that he was like, dude, when is the last time you saw hoists with traps traps? Like he was pretty jacked and is way heavier than normal. He was like, he usually is around one 70 something.

Speaker 2:          00:42:13       He was well over 200 pounds. But I think because of the benefit of steroids isn't just with weightlifting. It's like overall, you know, overall recovery overall energy and health, taking a cocktail. Probably a little growth hormone. Little tests. Little Epo. Yes, a hundred percent. I think the a big thing too, the vibrancy just having energy, just having enthusiasm and they don't test for Hipo do they? Oh yes they do. [inaudible] got popped for when he fought against mighty mouse Johnson for the flyway title and he's still suspended because the others. But there's guys, because I know that test is pretty. It's a, it's a little wishy washy. When we did bigger, stronger, faster, we looked heavily into the HIPO test and there's a guy that came up with a definitive test, a definitive like just either you're on it or you're not a synthetically. And um, the, he got a letter from the Olympic Committee saying from the US Olympic you soc saying we can't use your test because we'll be out.

Speaker 2:          00:43:10       It's unfair. Uh, you know, will be, it will be unfair to the Americans because the other foreign countries are relying goosey tests. Exactly. That's hilarious. So what they're saying is we're going to have to allow a certain amount of cheating to when exactly. That's really what they're saying. Well, we have to be able to cheat just as much as the rest of them. If you look at the, uh, you don't want to do these testosterone ratios, like 99 point nine percent of human beings should be at a one to one ratio. Epi, testosterone, the testosterone and kind of thing. And um, they allow it to be like four to one or six to six and now they'll have four. Right? So you can take a little bit and be under the radar. We've had guys pop it like 50 to one back. I remember when I was doing.

Speaker 2:          00:43:55       That's awesome. They like gorillas don't want to see a non tested UFC and have the guy's way, like over 300 pounds. They go one minute on and five minutes off you go and just let him just kill each other. They just fucking slug it out. I like the way you can't train. That's the other thing you can't train for fighting because that's an unfair advantage to then you know, how to fight and it ruins the fun. Well, the other person's training too, so it's not an unfair advantage. So you can lift weights. That's about it. That's it. I think that uh, there's, there's a benefit to being a certain

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       weight, but there's a negative effect when you get over a certain weight. And I think to 40 is around the right weight. I think a body weight, well our body, your, how lean you are is probably a big, a big thing too. I think once you get under 10 percent, I think is when you start to get in trouble, unless you're used to that, unless your body's always under 10 percent, then you could probably operate at that body, at that being that lien for awhile, you know, I just think if guys have good defensive skills and they can avoid the bum rush for the first couple rounds guy. So like over to 40, they have a real hard time getting into the third, fourth, and fifth rounds. It's just too much mass to carry around two bones and the muscle and all the blood's being that big.

Speaker 1:          00:45:10       Yeah, the oxygen requirements. So I think like a guy like Cain Velasquez is always about to 40, known for a spectacular cardio. Fabrice overdo them, same thing somewhere in the two thirties. That seems to be a shocking. And it was crazy. Came fucked up. I mean Cain is known for his cardio, so I think he just got a little cocky and decided not to go to Mexico City, but Mexico City is so I, I can't believe how high it is. 7,000 plus feet above altitude or trouble breathing. I worked on the gym and a fucking elliptical machine that was breathing heavy and it's almost like you can't be. These guys are gonna fight, but for Breesa was real smart. He moved to a place that's a thousand feet above that for like a month and a half. And cain was only there for two weeks and his improved all the ratio. You know, I, I see a lot of time at Gold's gym.

Speaker 1:          00:45:56       He, uh, he's improved vastly, you know, every, every step of the way, which is nice to see too. Well, he was such a high level Jujitsu guy. He was one of the best Jujitsu fighters in the world. And to get that good at Jujitsu you have to have an intense mind for learning. And so he just took that and applied it to boxing and kickboxing and just once he figured that out, everybody was fucked because you don't want to go to the ground without that beat some awesome fighters. Eco, the first guy, right? He's the first guy to submit fader or first got to submit cane, you know, that's, that's a pretty God damn spectacular resume. All he has to do is beat a few more guys and he is arguably one of the greatest heavyweight, if not the greatest of all time share. It's interesting that you bring up those two fighters.

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       It makes me Kinda think like maybe there's a upper weight limit of muscle mass that you can carry around because like neither one of those guys is real lean. So maybe around the 200 pound mark is probably almost like the cutoff if you start being more jacked than that, maybe you can't sustain it for three rounds. Yeah, I think it's a matter of durability. Like you want to be big enough so that you could take shots but you can't be too big because you just can't carry it into those. Especially a guy like Cain, although Coleman and occur, we're kind of the exception, but they were. They were on everything. Bathtubs full of shit. Brock Lesnar, animal, just an animal in such a freak of nature. I still maintain to this day that if somebody got a hold of Brock lesnar early on and said, listen to me and you can be the best heavyweight fighter ever like a for us as a hobby or a matt hume, like someone who's a real expert in mma who barack listened to and just said, look, this we're going to do first.

Speaker 1:          00:47:28       The first thing we're going to do is we're going to nothing but striking for like a couple of years and you're not. You're not going to get hit. I don't want you to develop any bad habits and you're not hitting anybody either. All you're gonna do is you're going to do movement with people. We're going to hit you. Get to do pad work, you're going to do technique work and we're going to have that shit built into your your neurons and we're gonna. We're gonna, have all these movements. They're going to be a part of your natural movement and if you're willing to do that, you're going to develop a base and that base will translate into success, but otherwise you're going to be scared of getting hit and that's what his problem always was. He would always get tagged by like someone like Shane car or more Alistair overeem and you could see just he didn't have enough time in there.

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       He doesn't like it either. Yeah. You got to spar with guys who barely touch. You were like, they're not hurting you and you don't hurt them, and that's in the beginning. That's like the most critical because otherwise you're gonna, miss giant chunks of the development because you just get a fucking swearing piece that he was able to get to where he did during all those years of wwe first. Yeah, like just fucking. What if he just went on? If we adjust, like you said, gone straight in. Oh, he would have been the best, but he was still a heavyweight champion of the fucking world. Knocked out randy coture beat the shit out of Frank Mir. He's a stud. I love watching him. He just had to. I was. I was kind of bummed but happy when he decided to quit mma recently had a. He had a moment where it's was trying to figure out whether it's going to keep going the wwe or give one more shot at the UFC and I know he talked to Dana, he talked to the UFC.

Speaker 1:          00:48:55       He was really thinking about it, but ultimately you don't want to see him go down a bad path of like being the guy that gets, you know, concussion is. I think that was a big one who's worried about posting concussion syndrome? Like Joseph Valtellina use the glory welterweight champion. He just stepped down and relinquish his title because of concussions, like concussions in MMA or a big fucking issue. And you don't hear about it. How do you feel about like, I watch a lot of fights where, you know, we want to see him go on, you just want to see your health. Some guys will get, don't stop it, don't stop it. I'm going to get pounded and come back. And they come right back. And it's like, oh well, good thing they didn't call it, you know, great job, Herb Dean or whoever the ref is. And then other times guys get pounded and uh, they get pounded 10 times in a row and then they're out.

Speaker 1:          00:49:38       And then it's like, well, they didn't need the 10 shots to be out. You know, it's why the fight is actually happening. I always root for the guy to come back, but after the fights over, like if I'm analyzing it from a rational standpoint, I'm always like, oh, stop. It is in trouble. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's not good at your ring side. I mean, it must be a little scary at times when people are blasted. Right. Some of the knockouts are, there's been some knockouts. We'd probably see the eyes and everything. Right. Yeah. How did you get into that? Like where you were you fighting before way before your wedding, way before you had a really big interest in it? Yeah, well I, I, um, I had stopped competing in like 1988. That's when I got into comedy and maybe 89 was probably like my last kickboxing fights and then I went into standup and then I just trained recreationally until like around [inaudible] 93.

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       The UFC came around. I think I saw the first, a tape, I saw a tape of it at 94 and then I was like, Holy Shit, what does this Jujitsu style? We were there from day one to it. I watched that first paper view live. I remember that like crazy to wanting to get a chance. I saw it on tape. Someone talked about it at the gym and I was like, what is going on? They you believe it, it's like a dream come true for us. So that was a commercial floor. I'm like, oh my God. That was crazy. Back in the day. And remember it used to be in the faces of death section of the videos are for like a long time. It went completely away. Well that's when I came in. I came in while I was banned. I started working in [inaudible] 97. So I started doing the post fight interviews and 97 while I was a sitcom.

Speaker 1:          00:51:12       These radio, I would go on the weekends, fly off the fucking bum, fuck, Alabama is a great book of blood in the cage that outlines all that stuff and it outlines like how a Dane. I got into it and they went to an event and he was like, this just sucks. They don't even sell tee shirts. They don't know what's going on. We need to like take this over, you know, that kind of thing. It's really cool. Yeah. They bought it in 2001 I think. And uh, I came in in 2002 and started doing the commentary. I remember it when it got in trouble before the, uh, the ultimate fighter. I actually worked for wwe and Vince Mcmahon, I remember being in limbo of Vince Mcmahon being like, dude, it's like they're trying to sell it. You should buy it. And he's like, he's, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:51:52       And then two years later they tried to unsuccessfully start some sort of a. and I may think, but I think Vince has been amended. Uh, yeah, they, they would try to, they never, never got off the ground. They were planning on it. Yeah. What happened though was Vince and he had a legitimate concern is like, I don't want it, don't take the legitimacy out of it. You know, like if he owned something like that, you know, they might think it's fixed. I think it's fake. Well, they didn't think that about the XFL, right? Guess not. Yeah. Yeah. I think the real problem is the talent pool know there's not that many good fighters in the UFC owns the contracts for 500 fighters. Wow. And they're all the best fighters. Sure. We, there's not one fighter in any weight class outside of the UFC that you can make a rational argument that's the best fighter in that weight class.

Speaker 1:          00:52:32       So once they have that, it's like, boy, it's hard to sell a league when you know that the UFC, this is our 170 pound world champion. Like, well, is that really because everybody knows Robbie lawler is the fucking world to launch any sort of competition. Yeah. It's just, it's hard for me. You know, I get it. Well this in other organizations like a world series of fighting us, some good fights, beltour have some good bytes, but it's just gonna be real hard for them to build stars to build like a. because everybody, like a kid coming up wants to be the best, you know, if he wants to be the best one and 35 pounds, he wants to fight Tj dillashaw. He doesn't want to fight Marty fuck face from a, from a Mike's Hardcore fighting championship. You know what I mean? It's like you just want to be the best, so they're always going to recruit the best guys.

Speaker 1:          00:53:19       They're ahead of the game, you know, that's not a lockdown game and you know, especially like if like Bella tour science or, and maybe somebody gets Gina Carano like chicken get weird. I feel like it's all like the same with wrestling now if you look at wwe, they've been, they've had a monopoly for awhile. Then wcw came along and they started getting popular, but then you know, now that the web, the legs, the other league TNA, it's so lame, you know, it's like, you know, nobody really gives a fuck about it at all and that's the thing is like in the end like UFC will be, it will be around forever. It's like the NFL, it, unless they sell it, they, they could, they could get to a point where they're like, look, let's get the fuck out of here. Yeah, work killing us. Because Dana works all day long every day.

Speaker 1:          00:53:59       He's constantly flying all over the world and Lorenzo's doing the same thing. It's like, it's a lot of work. It's not easy doing what those guys are doing and when they're gone, everybody's gonna miss him and people complaining about the EOC, but when they're gone you realize the alternative and if they've created an industry, people are mad about a stupid uniforms. I mean, that's the last thing I'd get mad about it. Well, they have some points fighter side when it comes to that with the sponsorships. It's just they lose too much money, you know, it's just. I've been, I was lucky enough to get in on the last, uh, the last thing before a reebok took over with, uh, with one of the fighters and was pretty cool. It's cool to see the logo up there and all that stuff. It was nice people. Well that's a big part of what the fighters get.

Speaker 1:          00:54:39       It's what you would say, like ego sponsorships, like dynamic fastener is on like so many. I don't even know what that is, but it's on so many different tee shirts. So many that'll reebok said the there. I guess it's, it seems like I'm over the spread over all the fighters. They'll make more money. The younger fighters or is that just not true? I don't think it's true. Yeah. No, I don't think it's true. I think maybe for deal changes or they start to make more money and you know, it becomes something bigger than what it is right now. But if you look at it right now, Tim Kennedy said it best reasonably. He said on one strikeforce card he made more money in sponsorships. Then the reebok paid out for the entire last UFC car from Brazil. Yeah. Gotcha. Wow. So all those people were wearing reebok gear.

Speaker 1:          00:55:21       He made more money from one fight in strikeforce. Yeah. So that's. Yeah, it looked like reebok had a pretty good deal from what I heard. I don't think it's a good deal. No. I mean, I mean for Reebok, but no, I don't think it's ideal for Reebok because what I'm saying because I think it gives them a bad name in some ways. Yeah. Yeah. I understand all these people come out and whereas. Yeah. No, no, no, no, that's not true, but all these people are complaining like Tim Kennedy complaints, titch Dorian complainants who gets fired for are complaining lots of fighters, a complainant, Brendan sharp complaint or all these different guys complained that that's all negative press towards their brand. I mean, they're not a person right there a brand. If you associate that brand, you can't like fire the head guy and change the brand.

Speaker 1:          00:56:04       The brand is still the brand. You know, when everybody's gonna associate that brand with it. Is it a big name brand? Yeah. Good. You see a big name brand attached to a sport like the UFC? Absolutely, but I feel like whenever you're in a situation where the fighters are going to lose money, that's always the number one concern that people have. Everybody knows the window of opportunity for a fighter is extremely small, so you have a few years to make some money, right? So when you take some of that money away from them in terms in favor of prestige, the prestige, which is inarguable, Reebok's, a huge brand, it's great to be in business with a big brand, but if it costs fighters money, boy that's going to be hot. You can't not see that. It's not like we're going to put blinders on and ignore that.

Speaker 1:          00:56:46       You have to address that. Social media is a huge thing. So the fighters are going to be heard. The new just. It's the big. It's bigger than anything because if you bitch about something on twitter and someone says, Holy Shit, Chris Bell just went off about that and then some newspaper gets ahold of it and then boom, it goes viral on facebook and people repost it and tweet it because we live in a different world. And so anytime someone like stitch gets fired because he said something about, hey, you know, reebok of this deal kind of sucks for me because now I'm not making as much money. So they fire them and then all of a sudden, boom, that becomes a way bigger issue than it was just with them saying that if he just said that and that was it, it would have been a small issue.

Speaker 1:          00:57:22       But him saying that and then getting fired for it, it compounds the issue. People react quickly to social media, you know, makes everything go faster. You know, they start wearing Nike's history. This is what. I'm not a business person. I'm not. I would, if I was running the UFC, it would've been bankrupt a long fucking time ago. But you, you, I think it's, it's real. It's real dangerous. Looking at the bright side of deals like this, like let's look at the bright side. I'm, let's look at the worst case scenario. What's the worst case scenario? Everybody is going to hate reebok. That's the worst case scenario. People gonna be mad at the UFC and mad at Reebok. So I go, Ooh, I don't know man. I was able to sponsor a Joseph Benevidez and that was pretty cool. But you know what? What is your company a slingshot?

Speaker 1:          00:58:06       This the slingshot that I had you throw on earlier, did banged out, banged out some pushups in. Yeah, he's got this cool device that you. A slide. It's like this heavy duty rubber thing that you slide up to your biceps and it actually gives you a bit of an assistance when doing pushups or bench press or something like that. Yeah, it feels good, man. I like it. Where can people get this? We want to get how much you benched on it? How much you bench go? There's the fucking plug. How much you bench dot? Yeah. What do you bench some retarded number? Like 700 pounds. I'm five. My best bench press and competition. This is where the bench shirt, which is much more heavy duty than than something like the slingshot. It's just a supportive device. It's crazy looking. Looks like a straight jacket, but I did an 854 pound bench press in the 275 pound weight class.

Speaker 1:          00:58:52       So then without a bench shirt, my best bench press is 560 pounds in competition. That's like a Harley Davidson. Right. How much do those weigh? Those weigh like 800 pounds. That's crazy. That's a lot of God. Damn. Wait Dude. How long have been at it for a long time. I started when I was 12, two older brothers that are dicks that forced me to lift weights even though I was and I didn't fucking want to know. What are those bench shirts? Those vests? Yeah. Bencher wearing a denim jacket. Backwards is what it's like and originally it was originally it was designed just

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       to be protective and then people were like, wait a second. Not only is it protective, but I can lift more weight with it. And so then they started making them more and more extreme. They used to be like one layer. Then they started making two layers and they started making them out of a pair of fucking genes and they started making them out of a canvas and all kinds of different where people revolted against that and now everybody lifts. Ra are a lot of people lift robin, you could say, oh, how much do you bench? Oh, fine. And raw would just be with just race ramps on. What did you do? Five. Five slash 65 slash 60. That's crazy. You can do 300 pounds more than one of those shirts. Yeah. Isn't that nuts? That is on the slot to his squad was like a thousand pounds to 180 squat.

Speaker 3:          01:00:00       And fell pretty bad with 185. He fell. I fucking felt. Well, what happened was, is there's a girl that's a, was trained under Jim and she's running, she's running the squat rack. The squat rack is called a monolift. And uh, when you, uh, you released this like lever so that I don't have to walk the weight backwards, you understand that, right? Another walked away backwards, the lever moves out of the way and I pick the weight up and go. The problem is the girl's hot and she's in a sundress and I'm trying to. I'm trying to concentrate on a lift here. And so midway down on the squat, one nice shoots out to left the other new shoots out the other way. And next thing I know is on the fucking ground. So it was it on your back or in front of you and now I.

Speaker 3:          01:00:41       well luckily I got kind of unloaded from the weight quickly it, it fell back behind me and I fell forward. I was fucked up for months from that. That was a, that was a pretty bad. How'd you fuck? Like what kind of injury? You know what? I never went to the doctor. I'm not a fan of going to the doctor so I just a rub some dirt on it and just lived with pain for awhile. It was like black and blue. My ankle was fucked up. My knees were fucked up. But you know, I, I did go to a, I went to a friend of mine. He's like, what are they? Gonna compare x rays and Mris and stuff too. It's like you already know you're all fucked up anyway. Oh, you fucked up from lifting? No, I'm not that bad. I'm, I'm pretty much.

Speaker 3:          01:01:16       Okay. I have why General Mri revealed damage? Well he just, he was just saying like, your knees are probably. There's probably slight tears here and there, you know, because I've had knee pain and all kinds of different things for years, so he was just saying like, you're, they're going to tell you that you're fucked up. He's like, what are you gonna do about it? Well, shoulders are a big one for guys. Events that much. Right. The shoulders packs and people blow off their pack. That's how I invented the slingshot was I tore my peck three times. I injured my times. Yeah. They were all stitched back in. No, no he didn't. No, I don't like going to the doctor. So you tore it and just dealt with it. Just dealt with it. Yeah. I didn't. I never had. I never had like a rupture, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:01:53       I never tore it all the way through. I never toured all the way through to where it was like bleeding down to the bicep and all that nasty shit that can happen with a torn Pec. I do it my tricep and it's brutal. Yeah. I've seen both the bone, seeing a lot of people that get the bicep curls up like a golf ball. It looks crazy, you know, like, uh, there's some fighters that, that like getting punched in the face. I kind of like pain. So for me it's kind of a, it's kind of just part of the territory with training. Yeah, the pain guys. Those are weird people. Person I know. I'm weird. Yeah, I don't mind it. I don't mind. Well, the thing about soreness, it's like it lets you know, like, yeah, I fucking really got to work out. There's a difference between soreness though and not being able to get up out of bed in the morning and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          01:02:35       That stuff's brutal. Joint pain, especially pain and joint pain are two different animals. Joint pains. Rough. Yeah. Can you know, you get some little shit that for some reason you just can't handle it. It's like the little tiny things that just no way. You're like, mother Fucker, why my elbow hurts so bad. Goddamn hangnails. What's the littlest thing from crazy lifting in general, like every, you know, pretty much everybody we know has some sort of injury hurt somewhere where you're not working out hard. One or two things and people. People, I looked at a certain forms of exercise like crossfit, saying like, oh, everybody gets hurt, and I'm like, everybody gets hurt. Power lifting, everybody I know that's a bodybuilder gets hurt like everybody else. Take any of them extremely doing this. And that's what we talked about. We were talking about on the way up here is a slowing down in your workouts.

Speaker 3:          01:03:20       Just taken time to actually, uh, think about what you're dealing with. One thousand pounds and 1000. Oh yeah, this five actually make this one. But see the sun drop. Why does it say tumble? Tumble? There we go. That's the girl in the sun dress. She fucked you up. We're going to look how big his face. Yeah. I'm about 320 pounds in this video or 300 pounds for. Damn, dude, that's a wide ass stance to you. Always squad that wide. Uh, in a squatsuit I squatted a little bit wider. It creates some tightness around the hips and kind of gives you some support through your hips because pretty hot to the guy behind. Isn't that I'm the trainer. UFC. Oh yeah, that's a novella. Who is a trainer of some UFC fighters, Chad Mendez, and I'm a Joseph Benevidez and a bunch of other small dudes that can fuck people up.

Speaker 3:          01:04:13       Yeah. It's funny that they have a whole camp full of those dudes, isn't it? This is this you've given out. Oh Jesus. Dude. God Damn. That's a lot of weight. Yeah. And so like, uh, when it happened and I felt it, it wasn't, it didn't hurt that bad initially, but then as time wore on it got worse and worse and worse. The swelling to start getting fucking crazy. I stayed at the competition and I'm a coach for all the athletes that are in that video basically. And I stayed the whole time and helped everybody and just like I normally would normally do. And then the next day when I woke up, I just, I couldn't, by the time I got home even I couldn't even, I couldn't even get upstairs to go to bed. I just fucking sat on the couch and sat on the chair and just slept in the chair for the night and slept right there for the next two or three days.

Speaker 3:          01:04:57       You know, one of the interesting aspects of your film was Louie Simmons, amazing. Greg, I have one of his, a reverse hypers and the back things are awesome. Credible machine for, for decompressing your lower back and pumping blood into it and everything. Oh, things amazing. But he's a refreshing character to, you know, it was funny when you were saying that you were going to get off steroids. He's like, we'll do that. Yeah, of course. But that's, that's the attitude that all those guys have. It's like, look, you just have to accept the fact that you are now a steroid dude. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And you know, making a good documentary. I think it's a lot about casting. It's about them. You pick, you know, it's just like any other movie who you picked to be in the movie. And Louie Simmons was somebody that inspired me to do things differently to think differently.

Speaker 3:          01:05:43       Used chains and bands. I used to go into Gold's gym, you know, 15, 20 minute pioneer that by the way, bands and chains and all that type of change on the bar to accommodate assistant. So like the band will. Oh, you can tell him it's getting harder as you get higher, as you squat is called good. It's called accommodating resistance. It basically makes you a drive into the bar faster. So if you can picture a bunch of chains on the bar, there's um, let's say 40 pounds of chains on the bar. As you lower those weights will be less and less weight on the bar and as you go to pick it back up, it will be more and more weight on the bar scene. You have to actually physically move faster. I'm a way that I try to explain it to people as if you were to try to hop up on this podcast table.

Speaker 3:          01:06:22       You can't do it slowly. So we trained with bands and change a similar thing. You have to do it quickly, you have to try to get a lot of acceleration into it. Does that make sense? So that would probably eight and explosive shit like football or punching people. And then also the also a huge benefit of it is that the weight is lighter at the bottom. Same thing kind of happens with the slingshot, but with the weight being lighter at the bottom, it's, it's, uh, creates a safer environment because the bottom of a squat and the bottom of bench presser kind of somewhat dangerous positions to be in. How much does it chain way normally they usually wait about 20 pounds. The ones that we use pretty pretty God damn thick. Yeah. Like big ass chains in the seventies boating type of. The thing is I would read a magazine called power lifting USA.

Speaker 3:          01:07:03       We didn't have the. Oh I thought you were going to say inches inches. I'll tell talking about that. And so action. So we used to look at that, that magazine, I was the only, only information on strength training and the entire world that a kid, 15 years old growing up in Poughkeepsie, New York and get his hands on. So I would read that and I'd go to the gym. I try out all these weird things and people like, what the fuck are you doing? And um, when I was a kid I was swatting you'll 500, four sets of eight reps and people are like, what, what does he squatted? Six hundred and 75 pounds in high school. He was just fucking, what the fuck are you won? Right? And I'm like, I'm not, I'm not on anything. I'm on Louie Simmons, you know. And so when I started training a mark to just be, you know, an animal, uh, it was, uh, he had a lifting belt that said Roy suck. I wrote out a director of bigger, stronger, faster ladies and gentlemen, and it said, Roy suck. And I would go to the gym and all these guys were like all juiced up like Poughkeepsie, New York. It's like, I don't know what is in the water there, but everybody was on something. And um, and I just always wanted to sort of deny that, go against that. Like I'm not doing this. And um, that's why that was the whole, the whole genesis for that movie was the fact that I always had this weird moral

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       thing, you know, like against it, I got, I can't do that. That's just fucking cheating. Jamie, can you get some of those? Caveman given us those nitro cans. Those fuckers are good. Bring in a few of those kind of kills. No, this is the good shit man. We're out a regular coffee. What, what was it that pushed you over the edge of, made you want to try steroids then? How Old Society? No. I went to USC and there's hot chicks everywhere and I wasn't a gorilla. You fucking squatting $600. Wasn't really in good shape. I didn't look good, but all you have to do is clean up your diet. He's always had to kind of a conflict with a with is like build. He's always been trying to get in better shape. And so I think that uh, steroids is a, a quicker and easier route in some cases to a get a little bit better shape and I totally understand that.

Speaker 2:          01:08:59       But I mean, you were, it sounds like if you. Would you say you squat six 75 percent? Yeah, when I was younger. Yeah. Fucking wait. I mean, you have to be a big fucker to do that. That was about, I was a little bit fatter than I am now to great out way about to 10. I was about to 40 maybe, you know, so it was just a matter of you just didn't like the way you looked at. I didn't like the way it looks is important. Everybody else was in good shape. I was training at golds. Venice had been goal. I've been gold's gym in Venice, in the hoaxster would be in there and you know, macho man, Randy Savage and I'm going to do when a black guy daughter the hawks. Jim, that's depressing. Shit, wasn't it? As it means he'll, he'll be back on his word rent.

Speaker 2:          01:09:39       He said some bad things, you know, he'll be, I think with wrestling, like it's the most inexcusable things have been excused and I think that they'll figure out a way to. Did they fire him from the wwe? They erased them from their website completely. Like, as if he never existed. Uh, you can't do that to the Hawks stadium. Yeah. I mean it's still pending the iron sheik. Yeah, I was there. I saw it. That'd be amazing. If you were there physically? No, I've never been one of those things. Madison Square Garden. I didn't. The wrestling, I don't know. No, no, because we were just saying all that shit. We were in. You were into martial arts since you were a little kid too, so I was going to do it in high school. In high school. I love Jimmy superfly snowfall and Bob backlund and all that wrestled Jimmy in.

Speaker 2:          01:10:24       Did you listen to where your career goes in wrestling? He pinned Jimmy superfly snuck a at an Indian casino for like 50 bucks in front of about 40 people. That's awesome. Where was this time in my life. What part? I don't know. Where the fuck I was. Where was I? Somewhere in California. Somewhere High Dam bucks. 50 bucks. Yep. God Damn it. What did he. He looked like a transvestite. He was hot. Wow. Rowdy Roddy Piper just passed away. Yeah, he was the nemesis. I'm having a next week, next Monday at the comedy store. There's a a tribute. Rowdy Roddy Piper and all the people at the new one. We're going to come in and I never got a chance to meet. That guy always bummed me out because he was fucking, her was awesome. That's all I heard. I heard was such

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       a great guy. That's what we loved about wrestling. Like we just love the personalities. We loved it. If UFC was around, we were like little kids. We probably went into that route, you know, our older brother was always beating somebody up, you know, and that's, he, he went into pro wrestling because that's all existed at the time. But I know if mma existence at the time you would have went that way. The um, the thing when you did with Jimmy snuck up, like how old was he at the time? He's got to be in a 65. This was probably about 15 years ago. A sixties then. But yeah. Yeah, he was definitely a definitely old. Definitely had a shape. Yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't pretty. Was it weird? Did it feel weird? I was fucking really weird. Yeah. And the poor guy, like what does he do for the wrestling in general is weird.

Speaker 3:          01:11:55       Like wrestling another dude. And like tights and stuff, it's really strange. I mean, like we, we used to run this small wrestling federation with a guy named Rick Bass man who's a good friend of ours and um, it was called upw ultimate pro wrestling and we put like 30 guys into wwe. So a lot of times like these young guys had to work with the older guys like John Ciena. We'd be working with, uh, Greg, the hammer, Valentine to hammer Valentine. Like, Hey kid, I'm not going to bump for anyone, you know, bump means hit them. I'm never gonna hit the mat, you just to beat the shit out of here. So it was like, that's part of a part of that. What does that mean? Bump? What did he just hit? The Mat basically, uh, you know, just like fall for the other guy. Meaning meaning like, the older guys don't want to do any of the work.

Speaker 3:          01:12:35       You're going to work around them and make them look good, but they're not actually going to do anything. Oh. So they don't fall down anymore because they're all being. Well that makes sense. Like fuck you on my phone now. It's super fly. Have that kind of a conversation with a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. What is, how does it, what does it go down? Well he basically uh, he just told me to different moves he wanted to do and I was like, all right, we'll just sounded like I'm not really getting into many moves. Was what happened was he did the superfly move, right? Yeah. And then you flipped them over and pinned them. So you ended up winning. Right. He still does the superfly change. It's amazing. He wanted me to like sit way up though, you know, I like to catch him and I did and it fucking, it hurt like a motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          01:13:17       I'm sure know these old guys will steph, you, you ever have another man jump off the top rope on, you know, I have not. Do you ever see the one with Brock Lesnar does the shooting star head? Yeah, I was actually there, done that move like hundreds of times when he was, when he was younger and the different federations where he got the web. I weren't really sucked. I worked at that Wrestlemania mania that was up in the sky box. I'm watching. I'm like, oh my God, he's dead. He's dead. Meanwhile, he's still completes the pin. Yeah. He just got his fucking paying for a week or something. He was. He was messed up a little bit, but he wasn't that bad compared to what it should have been. He's such a freak. He really is one of the biggest fleets in an interview. Like there's like two years and he just doesn't remember drugs because the drugs.

Speaker 3:          01:14:01       Oh wait, what was the on? I'm not sure if others. Probably Oxycontin. They do. That was the other thing that was in this in mind. There was an article about Rowdy Roddy. Piper were talking about the the drugs that they do. Here it is right here. Oh Shit. Look at this. Oh my God, Dude. A normal person would be dead and he's to 90 wrestled in Seattle. Kind of check. The is a. yeah, he was giant. Will what? We're just talking to talking about Piper to interview. Oh, they were talking about the amount of time that they spend on the road wrestling and that like any other sport you get like time break. Like these guys are restaurant. There's 100 nights a year, which is crazy. Like you don't, you can't recover, you just can't recover. So they all get hooked on pain pills. I just did a movie called the resurrection of Jake, the snake.

Speaker 3:          01:14:47       It's about jake the snake Roberts who was an eighties wrestler, you know, and he was a crack addict, so to another wrestler. Diamond Dallas page helps him get sober and we just showed that movie at slam dance. He'll be out pretty soon, but it really shows what these guys go through. Um, you know, afterwards it shows it's a documentary that's just like the movie, the wrestler. It's a real, real life. Darker. Darker though. Yeah, pretty much. It's fucking dark. Jake, the snake is a dallas diamond page is doing wrestling or doing yoga now yoga, but yoga, he's fucking crazy fit for an old dude, a superman. Pushups, you know, on his fingertips. Push that takes his ankle and puts it up by his fucking face and she went. I went to his house when we were doing the documentary. I was an executive producer on a documentary, which I do all the Hollywood stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:15:35       I help get it sold to help get it to festivals, all that kind of stuff and I just really believed in it and I believed in it from the beginning. I knew they were making it and they asked me to get behind it really early, so when I went down to their house to work on the movie, he's like, I'm going to take you through this yoga thing. And I'm like, okay, what is this bullshit? Within 10 minutes he had a heart rate monitor. My heart rate was up to 1:55 and he's like, okay, we got to slow you down to keep you at like 1:45. So this is like this constant cardio flexing, moving, awesome yoga thing that somebody like me needs for mobility. I think it's really, it's actually a really cool thing that he's doing well. Yoga is great for mobility. It's really hard to do.

Speaker 3:          01:16:14       It's one of those things where you look at a bunch of fucking soccer moms, but then you get in there, you're like, Holy Shit, this is a little bit more digestible for someone like me because it's a lot based. He sorta basis it around wrestling, flex like this and hold it and it's kind of fun, you know? Yeah. I get it. It's kind of, there's no, no mosque days. Now you had a double hip replacement. Yeah. Rick actually rate towards the end of doing bigger, stronger, faster. Uh, when we were doing the movie, I was just worn down all the time. I'm like, I don't know what's going on. I can barely walk. I had just kept having all these problems with my hips and um, went and got it checked out and the doctor said, okay, walk across the room. I walked across the room. He said, you need to fake ed two new hips.

Speaker 3:          01:16:58       And I'm like, what? Like, what are you talking about? He's like, you need to new heads. A doctor that itselves hips. He was an orthopedic surgeon, you know? And when the, what did the MRI reveal? I'm sure they did bone on bone and my bone was completely smashed on both sides. So they were smashed into the, into your engineer. He was in a lot of pain all the time. You could only, I mean like three, four hours at a time was what you could give to the film. Usually in a new. We're just shy. Sit down a lot and get out of this. You said this is a genetic issue? Yeah, my dad has the same thing. My Dad has two fake hips now, but he didn't get him until way later. So what happened was they, you know, who knows if, if a wearing down of the hips squatting all that much and whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:17:41       I don't really blame it on power lifting because I don't think that that's really the cause because there's a million power lifters out there and I'm the one with two fake hips, you know. So it's not like, oh this happens. Every power lifter, you know, it doesn't mean you think it has mess, have some effect. I think everything has. Everything has an effect. You know, it's like they played football, you wrestled like that. I mean he's, he's, uh, he doesn't have to fake hips and he's the same genetics, you know, as you know, as me. So I, I got it from my dad, you know, my dad has the same but what do they, what do they classify it as? What are they classified as? Just osteoarthritis and it's just so. But you only get into your hips now. I have it in my ankles and my knees.

Speaker 3:          01:18:18       I had both. My knees need to be replaced, but I'm just sort of, Jesus, I just sorta like putting that off because like you said, we have new therapies that you had your knees done when you were a kid too, right? Yeah. When I was 17 years old I had double knee surgery. So would you have done. I just had arthroscopic, a bone chips removed and stuff like that. Yeah. But, you know, the thing is I've been in pain my whole life, you know, and there was a certain point, uh, when I got the hip surgery that I wasn't able to able to handle it anymore and they started feeding me pills, you know, like crazy. And I got into that really hardcore because that was something that, uh, you know, at first you do it because it helps the pain and then after a while you do it because it's fun.

Speaker 3:          01:18:58       So this is post bigger, stronger, faster. After bigger, stronger, faster, bigger, stronger, faster. You get your double hip replacements and then you had the pill problem. Yeah, I got hooked on drugs. It's like, you know, you, you never aspire to become a drug addict, but it happens. And I'm a lot happened. A lot of my friends had happened to a lot of people doing a lot of people I know think a lot. You think a little bit of that had to do with like the recovery because you had both of them done rather than just like one of them done at a time. Yeah. I would always suggest to anybody that has to have double hip replacement surgery, we get one done at a time because at least you have one side that's good and the other side that heals. He literally couldn't really move at all.

Speaker 3:          01:19:32       I was sort of like in a point in my life where I'm like, you know what? Just do it. Who Cares? Let's go in and didn't really think it through that. How old were you? Thirty three at the time and who? Jesus Christ. Double Hip replacement at 33 and if you don't know what a double hip replacement means, they cut off the top of the bone and they literally have this long screw that they drive into the meat of the bone where the marrow is and it locks in place. This new fake hip, right? It's fucking gnarly shit. My friend Graham Hancock had it done. He was here six weeks later. He wasn't even walking with a limp when I was like, this is crazy. You

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       had a hip replacement complications with mine, so I'm on one of the sides. Added had complications of getting it in because they're like, oh, all this muscle from squatting your ass is like a rock. So they're trying to. They had to pound it in with a hammer. It looked like, um, I saw the surgery part of the surgery back on camera and it looked like an auto body shop fixing the car. Yeah. There's a video of Tito Ortiz getting. Is a disc replaced in his neck? She just got a disc fused. I think you gotta. I'm not sure it was a spacer or disc replaced, but they're fucking hammering on his neck. Like clink, clink, clink, clink, clink. Went, what the fuck? That's his neck, man. That is insane. So what does it feel like now? Now actually the hips feel okay. If I lift heavy, I still like, I'll still squat and dead lift.

Speaker 1:          01:20:54       I just can't go as heavy as I used to have dead lifted up to 50 slash 50 with two fake hips. Jesus Christ. Not a very good deadlift and mark's world. But you know, for, for having the surgery and everything, it's okay. And they're fine. Like it doesn't mean they're built. Did you tell the doctor like give me some fucking series heavy duty ones, road road shocks, there a titanium, you know, and I had a lot of people say, well why do you have to lift like that? Why do you like, you know, people always want to concern themselves, but you're doing. I'm like, wait, why do you feel you need, you have to lift like that. It's just something that's ingrained in you. You just like doing it. If you had surgery and somebody told you why you have to fight still why you have to go because you have to. Did you ask the doctor for a bigger Dick? That's an option. Oh, now when they cut you open, where do they cut you? A right on the. On the side of your ass cheek Kinda. Is it a giant scar that's like that big like three or four inches. Wow. That's amazing. You do all that work with three or four inches? Yeah. Like I have a buddy who was on the US ski team.

Speaker 1:          01:21:55       He was on the US ski team and uh, he's had no bullshit, I think 28 knee surgeries. Wow. Yeah, he's got, I'll show you the surface of his knees. Skiing is not good for your knees. He's had his knees resurfaced. He's. Yeah, it's fucking gnarly. Let me find this picture real quick and I'll show it to you because it's, it's one of those where I show people and they go, what am I looking at? He um, but anyway, his scars on his knee, it looks like, like, like you're gutting a fish, like they go all the way down the side of the knee and they opened it up and this was just in the eighties. My Dad has that. My Dad has, you know, fake knees also and he's got those big scars. Fuck man. Your Dad's got it rough. He's a warrior Frankenstein that is a, that's a lot of fucking surgery.

Speaker 1:          01:22:42       A lot of shit to get done on your body. Yeah. Fake News and fake hips. So you think that you're gonna eventually have to do that to the knees? Yeah, I like try to hold it off as long as possible and I think that the best way to go is uh, trying new therapies like stem cells, other things that are coming out. Um, I know that certain, uh, there's actually a gel that they can put into knee, uh, the replaced cartilage. Uh, John, I hadn't done. It's like a, it's a very advanced technique that, you know, they're just basically they use very sparingly. Well, I know that they're doing, they have this new meniscus surgery they're doing where they're taking this like a scaffolding and they implanted inside where your meniscus, she used to be in with these proteins in it and somehow or another your body grows meniscus in the scaffolding as it make sense that they're able to do. Now it's just amazing. Let me show you. This is my buddy's knee.

Speaker 1:          01:23:43       Wow. Yeah, that's the same guy that was on the US ski team. They cut them. Steve Graham. What's up brother? They cut them. Just kind of like fish. It looks like steak and like two wedding rings. It's fucking gnarly. Yeah, it's pretty hardcore. I'll send this to you, Jamie, so you can put it up on the uh, it looks great. Injuries are no joke, you know? Yeah. No, there are no drug. Well, this, this guy too. He's fucking crazy. He's in his sixties. He's still spars, mma on a regular basis. He's an animal. He's a doctor. Ophthalmologist doesn't give a fuck. He's, he's always been crazy. He's just A. I've known this guy for it. He's a guy who talked me into doing standup has always been an animal. He's just, uh, it's just hard to imagine that. That's Shit I saw you do stand up in Sacramento, but two years ago maybe.

Speaker 1:          01:24:31       Oh, where was it at maybe three years ago? Um, I don't know, like comedy store or some shit like that. Cool little upstairs comedy club. That's a good spot. They have the punchline, right? Yeah. Yep. Do you live up there? I commando Sacramento. Do you go to team Alpha male and watch those? You know, I'm friends with those guys. I haven't been over there a whole lot, but I've seen you ride around. I see those guys around a little bit here and there and he's got a huge, his own gym. Huge Gym. Okay. Give it a plug. What's the name of the gym? The super training gym just in West Sacramento, but it doesn't matter because it's free. Yeah, it's kind of weird. It's free. The gym is free. How's that work? It doesn't, it's not the smartest business models. Not My brightest idea. What a gym is free.

Speaker 1:          01:25:15       It's a way for me to, um, give back to power lifting. It's predominantly a power thing facility. Um, and I think that if other people had the ability to make their gym free, they probably would do it. And so I'm in a position to make it for free. So I did. Wow, that's crazy. That's a, that's a beautiful thing. Then you never hear that. You usually find exact opposite to what everybody asks for him. Hey, can you train me? Can you train me? He's like, I don't train people. I even do seminars and stuff a lot for free. I just did one at a deuces gym in Venice and then a lot of times I'll do them to some down in downtown La at the Barbell Brigade, but just if I'm in town somewhere, I'll just, uh, I'll just, I'll email email the owner of the gym to say, Hey, I'd love to come in and teach your people how to squat or deadlift. And they're like, okay, well what does it cost? I'm like, it doesn't cost anything.

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       That's so crazy. End The fucking do some work. What makes you such a generous guy? That's. I just kind of have a passion for inspiring people and not so much a just instructing them because I think that the main message is to get people moving and get people doing shit rather than just saying, oh, here's how you, to people that we look up to you, Louie Simmons, you know, Louis sent Pat Miletich has a free gym, you know, I don't know if he still has it, but he had it free gym said to help people do what you couldn't do when you were younger. You know, that's, it's great for, for young folks. There's the fucking knee and it's all, it's good and you know, uh, to his, uh, what, what ended up happening is people, um, I'll put up a post on instagram. It could be of like me eating food or some shit and somebody would say, oh, I got your slingshot, I got your raps, I got you're this, you're that.

Speaker 3:          01:26:51       So it's like people are given back to me anyway. So it just, um, it's just another way for me to give back to the community and for like a, you said Reebok is, is a brand of my company is not my company is me. And so the brand is growing and sometimes people don't know that I'm associated with it, but nine times out of 10 they do know I'm associated with it. That's awesome man. That's a, that's a beautiful way of looking at things. I love it. And because of that we were just actually at the coffee bean next door and these two guys wanted to take a picture with them. They're like, they know who, you know, people know who he is. Yeah. And it's funny because you tons of free videos, youtube.com backslash super training. Oh six thousands of free videos on there on how to squat, deadlift bench, that kind of shit.

Speaker 3:          01:27:30       Nice. Now your new documentary is prescription thugs. Absolutely. Yeah. And this is based on your experience and getting hooked on pain pills after you had your double hip replacement. Yeah. Sort of based on a lot of people's experience, you know, after bigger, stronger, faster. Our older brother passed away about eight months after making that movie and he had a really bad struggle with prescription drugs, mainly painkillers. Uh, and then it went to, you know, oxycotton when you could use it, used to be able to crush it up and inject it and all that, stuff like that. And he was getting into that kind of stuff. Um, I don't know if he's injecting it, but he was definitely snorting it and different things like that. He loved it all. Yeah. My parents found out about it and they were obviously heartbroken and um, helped him, helps him get clean for awhile and then, you know, then you go back to it and back and forth and back and forth.

Speaker 3:          01:28:20       And um, it's just crazy because he, after he got off all the pills, sorta switched to alcohol, you know, and it was like alcohol a little bit. Everything else, a lot of weed, a lot of alcohol and this and that, you know, just things that, uh, that when you're not in the right state of mind or you're depressed or not the best things for you, you know. And he ended up, seemed like from the day he ended up going down like a really bad, a bad, a bad spiral, you know, and he was on some psych meds to a for depression and different things like that. And um, he died in a sober living house with no real explanation of how he died. And uh, we still don't really know exactly what happened. There was really no drugs found in his system in a toxicology report and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       So it was just like, to me something where, uh, you know, this is an epidemic that hit home with me, uh, after I saw my brother died and I was like, I will never go down that path and there I am on the floor scrambling, looking for like another Vicodin, you know, going, I must've dropped one somewhere and just knowing a lot of other people that went through it, I decided to pick up and make a movie about it. Now your brother in your bigger, stronger, faster. Seemed like a very troubled guy. Yeah. Mad Dog. Yeah. He struggled with himself more so than anything else. He was bipolar and so all this stuff sort of compounded that. Yeah. I think we get a prescription. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but did he get a prescription for an injury or how did he get it? He was wrestling with the wwe who was sort of a, you know, on the going, doing, doing the rounds.

Speaker 3:          01:29:46       And so if you've got a prescription but he got drugs. Yeah. Yeah. And they all got drugs. When did he start wrestling for the wwe pro? Back in like 1990, like early nineties and he wrestled forever, like he was always on tv or so, 93, something like that. He was always on TV and then he wrestled all the way through. I'm kind of up until he died. Like he had some still some matches, not really with wwe but with other smaller federations and stuff like that. So he kind of wrestled for a real long time, but he never really made it and that was a really big problem for him, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't good enough to be a good coach or a good teacher. He wanted to. He wanted to make it. He wanted to be. I don't know if he knew exactly what he was chasing.

Speaker 3:          01:30:27       So even if he obtained some of that success, I don't think he would even recognized it along the way. Point. It's a really good point and I think a lot of people, yeah, they, it's hard to get satisfied with certain things and so he was just, he was troubled. He, you know, the quote that's on the wall in my gym is a from the film, he says, I'd rather be dead than average. And that was uh, something that he, you know, he just, he couldn't live without, um, you know, being with whatever his ideal for success was. And the problem I think that you really just nailed though is that they don't know what that is. What's that goal, what is that? And if they don't ever reach it, they never feel satisfied. And the thing is that he be, despite it all, that he's like the nicest, coolest guy in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:31:08       And we would have our backs, you know, on a, on everything today. You have good friends. Yeah. He had crazy emotional really what everybody has, right? They have good friends and then they get into drugs and then they don't have good friends, you know. So you have a lot of enabling people, a lot of people that will allow you to keep doing what you're doing. A lot of people that will put up with your bullshit. Uh, my father wasn't one of them, you know, my father was somebody who like put his foot down and was helping them get clean and um, you know, we just weren't able to catch it in time, you know, and so people that are listening to this, I think it's really important to talk about these issues. It's just a, you know, people want to always trying to push these issues under the rug.

Speaker 3:          01:31:45       So if he knows someone who's struggling, try your best to reach out to them and just see if you can get to the bottom of the problem. I know it's the worst fucking thing in the world to try to approach somebody about it, but see if you know, whatever you think is a good way of going about doing it and try to reach out to the person because you don't know how much longer it will be here for. It's just so hard to get people to listen to you though, isn't it? It's brutal. It is, yeah. When you've been through it, it becomes a different. It completely becomes different. So I, I went through it, I ended up, um, it's kind of crazy halfway through this film that I was making relapsing and started popping xanax and all sorts of other stuff. Film on prescription drugs.

Speaker 3:          01:32:23       You start relapsing? Yes. Wow. What the fuck? Right. That's how crazy. When did you do this film? We finished it. We finished it for Tribeca film festival. So that was like in May. So you, you relapsed like a year ago, a year and five months ago. Fuck. And um, I was popping xanax and stuff like that because you know, there's like, filmmaking is not an easy business, you know, cause like if you were, if you didn't have all this other stuff going on, you were just a comic and you were trying to make it. It's, it's brutal. You know, the ups and downs and oh I have an audition for something I've seen other people be successful can really beat you down, fly by you that were like way behind you, you know, all these different things that go on in your head. You feel like that about the documentary world.

Speaker 3:          01:33:08       That's like people that were making some documentaries that would do really well and you get bummed out. I wouldn't really get bummed out so much about other people. I try to always stay in my own lane and think about myself, but I get more bummed out putting the pressure on myself. Nobody elements do real well and you go, God dammit, why am I doing? I could have done that. Or somebody makes a documentary and then they're like off to the races doing like all these big movies and you know, like, why? Why didn't somebody pick me for that? You know, like my documentary did way better than that documentary or so you know, those kinds of things in, in your eyes. But just the film world in general, Hollywood in general gave me this feeling of enact adequacy. It gave me a feeling like I wasn't good enough.

Speaker 3:          01:33:43       Like everything I did, I wasn't making it and people go, well you did this hit movie. It was really big and like, yeah, but it didn't really make money at the box office like it did really? Which is a not your original intent. Like when he made the film, he said, I want a lot of people to see the movie. Tons of people seeing your language. When you say it gave you this feeling of inadequacy, but isn't that maybe the way you approached it yourself? I mean, it seems obvious giving you anything, right? I made that up in his own head. In your own head, you feel inadequate. You feel like, Oh man, you know, I, you know, and as many as many people tell you that you do good, you're still looking for, like you said, you're still searching for that thing. So for me it was all about finding balance.

Speaker 3:          01:34:23       So when I relapsed and realize I need help, that's A. I reached out. I didn't really reach out. But once I, once I knew I needed help and everybody sort of figured me out, my girlfriend helped me a lot with it. Um, she sort of found me a really fucked up one day, a drunk and on, on Xanax in the middle of the night. And uh, she called me. I don't really answer my phone a whole lot. Um, I don't respond to it, a ton, rings a lot and I get a lot of messages and shit, so I'm not really a on my phone that much for that kind of stuff, but I noticed a number of was odd and it was probably like about midnight, so it was like, it just seems kind of weird. That's not like a telemarketer, you know, like calling it like 7:00 PM or something.

Speaker 3:          01:35:05       This is something different and for whatever reason, I didn't have her number in my phone, um, but it was from like Pennsylvania or something, I think where she's originally from. And uh, it was lauren and she said, you know, your brother is blah, blah, blah. And I couldn't understand what she was saying. She was very, very, a very sad and crying and stuff. And so I asked her to kind of calmed down and I'm kind of assess the situation a little bit. And she said, I think your brother's in, in his, uh, apartment. I think he's passed out. Um, I said, well, you're the only one there. You got to kind of go in and, you know, see what's, she's like, I don't know how I'm going to find them or, and I was Kinda like, Whoa, like, what do you mean you don't know how you're going to find them because I don't, I didn't know how bad the situation was or how serious it was.

Speaker 3:          01:35:49       I did know his friend, his friend called me a few times that, hey man, you know, your brothers, you know, he's fucking up with some pills and doing this and that here and there. Um, and then, uh, you know, then then I would communicate with that person again and I'd find out that he's doing a little bit better and then he'd be doing a little bit worse. So it Kinda went back and forth and you know, having my other brother died from it. I was like, fuck man, I don't even know. I don't have the energy to fucking go down that road again. You know, I want to reach out to him. I want to talk to him. I do love him. He's a hero and an idol to me and a lot of ways and uh, I really did want to reach out to them, but I just didn't know how to fucking bring it up, but, you know, he was really suffering and I didn't really realize how bad it was until she called.

Speaker 3:          01:36:30       And then I got off the phone with her. I just said, you know, take his keys away and make sure he's okay. Talk to my wife, my wife's fucking awesome. She's super supportive about all this kind of stuff. And she said, we need to fly him here tomorrow, you know. And I said, well, let's fly lauren here to make sure he gets on the fucking flight, that he's not drinking or taking pills or doing something crazy and he misses his flight. So we flew both of them up. We're able to get him some treatment where he was able to, uh, work on starting to recover. It's a nasty path, you know, it's, it's, um, did you document this in the film? I didn't document all the stuff that went down, like leading up to it, but yeah, it's, it's in the film we talk about it for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:37:11       Um, but like I said, it's a nasty path that like, it's like a snowball effect, you know what I mean? And looking, looking at it now, it's like, I mean it's not funny ever but it's like laughable how like, what the fuck was I thinking, you know, I can see it now from a different point of view. So you said you relapsed on Xanax. So was it just you were having anxiety? No, I mean I think that it's just whatever, you know, you just like to take it because a, it may, you know, you can't sleep. My, my mind is always racing. There's always another idea in the head and there's always, I can't go to sleep, you know? So I've tried the float, the float chambers. I've tried stuff like that. I can't even get my mind to stop thinking a lot of times or so I thought

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       so. I always thought that I needed something, whether it was alcohol, whether it was pills, and I realized through the whole journey that all I really needed was to believe in myself again to believe in who I really was and what I started doing when I started out trying to make films in the first place and tell the truth and be honest. The problem was I couldn't be honest with myself. I had a real hard time being honest with myself and that's what a recovery has has brought to me. It's, uh, it's amazing to be able to know how much he's allowed to talk about the film, but I'll talk about it a little bit. He, uh, yeah, he basically interviewed somebody for the film. Uh, the ended up helping him. He interviewed this guy, Richard Tate, who, uh, owns a treatment center in Malibu and he, for his film, he researched it and they had like a 95 percent success rate with people that were there I think for over 60 days or something like that, 90 days, 90 days.

Speaker 2:          01:38:45       And he was like, what the fuck? Ninety five percent success rate. That's crazy. The whole time I'm interviewing the guy, I'm like, I wish I could come here. I wish I could come here because I knew that I still had a problem with alcohol and um, I wasn't really doing xanax at the time, but like he researched it for himself. He's trying to tell him stuff. He's researching for the film, but he's researched. Weird thing, man. You start like looking, did you go to this place? Yeah. I ended up going to cliffside Malibu for 90 days. So what do they do that so successful? They just change your life about everything. But Richard Tate was a wild man himself and he gave me. Here's the thing, when you have a guide telling you, listen, 14 years ago I was on my couch smoking crack with a hooker on each side.

Speaker 2:          01:39:23       I was oiled up for some reason. Smoking, cigar, smoking, crack, you know, and those, a good time. Yeah. Yeah. And it tells you, you know, that eight of his friends come and knock on his door and try to get him sober and he slams his door the door in his face. And then, uh, he's like, you know what, that was rude. He goes back and opens the door. He goes, what day is it? And they said, it's Friday. And he goes, come back on a Monday. And he slams the door. They come back on Monday. He was like, at that point, just done doing drugs and alcohol and, uh, they took them to treatment. I'm like, man, if this guy can get better. Like I wasn't doing, I wasn't, I wasn't that bad, but I didn't have hookers. Yeah, at least I didn't know. What did they do for you?

Speaker 2:          01:40:04       What is, what is the process of getting someone to get 95 percent of people staying clean? First part is a separation from the problem. Uh, just just being away from drugs and alcohol I think like Aa is a great thing, but for me, if I would have went to an AA meeting, I would have went home and drank that night. I needed to be. For me, I needed to be in a place where I couldn't get isolated. I needed to be isolated from it for a little while to get away from it. Uh, the main, the main thing was therapy. It's all therapeutic. It's all like group therapy. He goes sit in a group with people that are fucked up and you talk about your problems and in a, in a good facility, they had such good counselors there that they, these people, like it was a, it was more about like being loved again, feeling part of your, you know, I moved to La and I was on my own.

Speaker 2:          01:40:51       I moved to La when I was 19 years from, from New York. My whole family was back east. My brother moved out here, eventually my older brother moved out of here eventually and eventually my parents moved out here and we do have a close family too. We have a really close family. So to be away from your family and this whole time and not feel like any love from the world is a tough thing, you know, and like a lot of people don't really express that, you know, might sound kind of wimpy or something like that. But it's true. We didn't, there was no feeling of comfort or safety or security in anything that I, that I did. So like regaining that through being around people with like minded experiences and there's just some counselors there that will break you. You know, there, there's people that go there, hardcore heroin addicts that like will sit there and in group therapy and not want to be analyzed, you know, and these guys don't break them down until they're, you know, punching pillows and shit saying this is my father and fucking piece of Shit, you know, that's how it goes.

Speaker 2:          01:41:50       It's like, it's a really intense, a therapeutic thing. Uh, that allows you to see yourself in a different way and it's a very humbling. The number one thing is like, uh, the number one thing that I had on my side was a desperation to get better. That was one of the fucked up parts of the film. Bigger, stronger, faster. Was Your Dad saying they knew that your older brother was going to die that way and to go through that and then have your brother die that way and then for you to get hooked on pills yourself that, that hadn't been a helpless feeling. Like that's why I felt like I couldn't tell anybody. So I went to my parents and I was doing an interview with them and I really wanted to tell him, but I was like, you know, I don't know if I can tell them.

Speaker 2:          01:42:32       So early on in the movie before I, before I had relapsed, I said, hey, listen, I had a problem with this. My mom cries. And she's like, well, why didn't you tell me? I'm like, how am I supposed to tell you? You just lost a son. I'm going to tell you like I'm going to go, you know, next year you're going to worry about me because I'm not there. You know what is. If you can try to describe what is the feeling like when you want to take that shit, when you want to take a pain pill, like what? What is. There is no feeling. It's a, it's, it's not. It's not the addicts fault. Like you might have, you know, friends or people that you know that I want to just wake up and stop drinking. Well you can't. It's not your fault anymore. It's a, it's a pathway, a neurological pathway.

Speaker 2:          01:43:15       You just talked about before Brock Lesnar, somebody got a hold of them and built those punches and kicks into his system. Right? It becomes ingrained and built in your system. It becomes a neurological pathway in your brain and you tend to habituate the things that make you feel good. You know? So that's just something that an addict will do more so than other people. You're saying that this is very distinct black and white thing, that it's not the, the, the addicts fault, but the addict has to be sober first before they can get fucked up. Right. So you're sober, you're sober, you have a conscious mind, you're aware of your actions and decide to take a pain pill. How is that not the addicts fault? If you're already addicted? It's, it's an automatic thing. Your body feels like it needs it. Okay. You, we're an addicted maybe because he never got actual treatment.

Speaker 2:          01:44:03       How do you get addicted in the first place, but you weren't because you were off of it for a long time. Right. So it wasn't like he had this mad need, like your bones were aching. You had to get that. I think you switched to alcohol I think is kind of the part that you're at. Yeah, I switched to alcohol like instead of having pills, so I always had something. So you get the double hip replacement surgery. So you did your documentary bigger, stronger, faster was 2008. So right after that, 2009. Like when are you talking about? You're getting your hip replaced in 2009. Okay. Six years ago. And then how you get off the shit? Our 2007. I actually got to replace. I got it done before we finished the movie. Okay. Okay. Oh you did 2017. But then. But then I didn't mention this. So then I had um, my hip, they said, I said they had complications.

Speaker 2:          01:44:50       I had, they had to Redo my hip. Oh. So two years later they, we did it in 2009. They redid my right hip. They completely took it out and put it back together. Oh my, screw it. Well, there's some messed up parts in there that they have to unscrew that thing that I think they left that. I think that was fine. I think it's the other part that was messed up. And then a month after I had that hip surgery, my brother died, you know, and it's just tough. It's just, you know, it's like you can, you can power through that stuff if you have the tools. But I didn't have any tools to stay sober or let me ask you this. So you get the hip replacement surgery the first time, then you get hooked on pills, then you get off pills, but two years later they want to reopen you up.

Speaker 2:          01:45:36       Do you take pills again? And got back on pills for how long? About another two years. And then, and then what happened was, so then I went I fucking years. Yeah. So then I went back to uh, to try to get off the pills. Like I knew I needed to get off the pillow long. Where you want them for the first time. The first time when you had the first problem a I was on them almost. I was on them for like a year and then I got off of him, uh, for how long, but I only got off them for a couple months and I had the second surgery again. So it was a really gotten off of them. It's a really up and down. Thanks. So the drug called suboxone and suboxone sort of mimics the way that a painkiller will feel in your body. Uh, but it doesn't have.

Speaker 2:          01:46:15       Well it doesn't, it doesn't get you high. It'll just basically making it not feel sick. So that's the biggest problem is withdrawals. You feel so bad. It's like the flu times 100. So the thing is that when you're coming off of them and you want to get on suboxone. So my, my insurance would cover all the pills so there was 10 bucks a pop, you know, 10 bucks for like 180 pills of percocet or vicodin or whatever the drug I was taken when I wanted to get off of them, I had to consult with a doctor every month for $250 and I had to pay about 225 to $250. The drug and insurance doesn't cover any of that. They don't cover you getting better, they only cover you doing the dangerous drugs. That's another brutal thing on top of it, you know? And then suboxone I think that is.

Speaker 2:          01:47:01       Do you think that's built into the system? Do they sell more drugs built into the system? So that's a scary thought, if that's true. Yeah. That they absolutely like if you look at it, if you want to. If it's like, you know, like yes, if you take painkillers, it's your fault for getting addicted, kind of. But if you actually look at the history of Oxycontin, that drug was designed to hook people on what's basically very similar to heroin. You know, it's, it's uh, it, the drug company that makes it, that made it purdue pharmaceuticals, they, they lied, they, you know, they made $8,000,000,000 on this drug, right? $8,000,000,000. And then they had to pay a fine of $2,000,000,000. So like, look at the profit, still $6,000,000,000. They call it the price of doing business, you know, so they lied and said that you will not get addicted using this drug.

Speaker 2:          01:47:51       Well, they got the whole country addicted to this drug, you know, it was, those people should all be in prison. They got the whole, the whole country addicted to a drug that's made for like severe cancer patients, you know. And that kind of stuff is, is this criminal? And people go like, oh, well you should have known. It's like most people don't know. That's why we're making a movie. To have awareness, you know, for these things. So this is really fresh for you. This is not something that you have overcome a long time ago. No, no. I still go to meetings and I still stay up on it. I think every day you need to remind yourself that you can go back there. So you're 100 percent sober now. You don't fuck with no. Nothing. Nothing. So the feeling that you get like when, when you, when you have this relapse with a Xanax, that feeling that you get, is it just, you just feel helpless?

Speaker 2:          01:48:41       Like what do you do? You feel just pulled to it? Like what do you. What's pulling? Yeah, like for example, so xanax was a drug that would help me, I would drink a lot, you know, like I wasn't because because I was an addict why he'd, he'd kind of drank to the point where, you know, it was a compromising the next day type of thing. And then also you ended up in the hospital a couple of times from drinking. Yeah. I would say serious bouts of drinking, but it wasn't like he really knows this, but I went to the, to the uh, urgent care or emergency room I think 10 times within a matter of like 20 days. What's, yeah, because I go to urgent care and I'd go get xanax because I had a hangover so bad because I would drink so much, you know, and it was continuous like every day. So for me it became, it became a labor. It became like everyday I was like, you know, uh, this cat chasing its tail. I, I ever get better or feel better at first. You weren't drinking that often though, right? No, at first it was like every three days, seven days, you know, we talked about it, power lifting and everything like that. We were sports guys, like we were never into drinking, were never into drugs. Like

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       that wasn't something even on my radar when I did bigger, stronger, faster, I would drink, you know, here and there. But I should have known back then because like when I did drink it was like binge drinking and that's when you know that you'll probably have a problem somewhere down the road if you're the guy that drinks and you got the guy that drinks once a month, but you get completely hammered, you know that you might have a problem. You know, I wasn't the guy that could ever put it down. So how, what does it feel like to make a documentary about prescription drugs while you're hooked on prescription drugs? A guilty really guilty the whole time. Like I had raised the money to do it. That was moving forward with it. Had a bunch of people involved. So I'm like, who the fuck do I tell?

Speaker 3:          01:50:26       You know, you're in this weird situation where you're like, I'm a hypocrite but I can't stop what I just stopped doing this and pull the plug and I have people working for me. People editing the film. A partner Greg young was there since the very beginning and he was, you know, he knew what was going on, but he didn't know was going to do to like pull the plug on his own job and he, he didn't, he cared about me and wanted to help me, but he didn't know how to help me. You know, how much of a part of the film does this become a, it's, it's sort of a, towards, towards the end. Uh, it's sort of like in the, in the third act of the film, you know, we sort of discuss it and go into it. Uh, we didn't go into a whole lot about recovery because of the movie isn't really about that, but anyway, by the end of the movie, you know, I'm okay.

Speaker 3:          01:51:11       And if a whole quarter, a whole quarter of a year, you know, that's crazy. They, they take you away from society for very few people can afford to do that. No, it's crazy man. And what happened was, uh, if I feel this, I feel almost everybody, if they could unplug from their life for like 30 days, even like 10 days, like people go on vacation, they still bring your phone and stuff. A lot of people around them that they know and it's supposed to be in that environment of solitude is just like an amazing feeling that I'm though dark. Yeah. Yeah. Going dark, what happened to me was in the, so yes, how they helped me and um, I could tell you that I think part of it a big huge part of it and they've talked about like Aa and all these other programs and everything ever talks about a spiritual awakening.

Speaker 3:          01:51:58       So the third day that I was in Rehab, I went and took a shower and it was like 4:00 in the morning or something. I couldn't even, I couldn't sleep or anything. And I went in the shower and I just cried for like three hours. The fuck am I doing. I went to USC film school, I went, I did all the right things. I, I trained my whole life. I did everything the right way and I'm fucking blowing it and that's what got to me, you know, it was my self that got to me. It wasn't, it wasn't anybody else really. You know, another thing that happened to them in treatment was a cliff side. Malibu is beautiful, multimillion dollar facility. It's a, it's really nice. It's in fucking Malibu, California, which is beautiful. But I think once you were there for like two weeks, they took you away from there and three and some shit hole. Right? Yeah. What happened was that,

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       so I was there for. I personally think it's all part of the plan, but I don't know. Yeah, I was there for 10 days and um, and after 10 days, uh, I was being helped by the facility. They, they were, they were funding it. They were helping me. So, um, since they were helping me out because I was part of this movie and the guy just had compassion for me, Richard Tate and wanted to see me get better. The guy was suspicious that you had a problem when you came here the first time to interview them anyway. Right, exactly. And so, so he said to me, we can't afford to keep you here anymore. It's 60 grand a month to go to that place. Jesus Christ, a lot of insurance covers it, you know, and things like that. Yeah, insurance covers that. It depends on your double scam.

Speaker 2:          01:53:25       So it's the fucking insurance covers that they may go. It's all part of the system. So it's all part of the system in some box money for that. Yeah. So it's hard to come up with that money. I need money for that. Sorry. Yeah. But the, but they have the money for the treatment. Everything. So anyway, throw you in this place. That's not so good. So what happened was I went to a place called Claire Foundation. It's in Santa Monica and it's very industrial. It's a, it's a government run Rehab facility. Uh, and it's, I mean I walked in there and saw this guy with no teeth and he was scratching his nuts and he's like, you're not going to like it in here. The pillows are really tough, you know, and I walk in, I'm like, where the fuck do you sleep in here? And I'm looking and there's all these bunk beds.

Speaker 2:          01:54:10       I'm like, well where's my room? And I'm like, no, there is no room. It's one big room with 40 bunk beds and 40 grown men and 39 of them just got out of jail and you're the only one. It's normal kind of, you know, it was sort of a facility like that. Whereas this is something out of like one flew over the cuckoo's nest and when they put me in there that was like, fuck this man this, you know, I know like a lot of addicts will say like, I'm not like that and I'm not like this. This was something that was so far fetched from where I would ever find myself in my life so far down that I was like, fuck this, I'm getting Outta here and this is it. I'm never going to drink or do a drug again. And it'll hopefully, hopefully you can stick to that, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:54:51       Um, but I don't have any urges to anymore. But it was that facility that um, that really cemented it, you know, after that's the only 10 days, so why I was in that facility for 19 days and it was like about 10 days in 10 days, days, 19 days there. And then, and then when I got, when they had ruined for me back at cliffside and it ended up going back to Malibu and like living out the rest of it in Malibu. And what was really nice about that was I was still able to work, so I was going to treatment every day for three hours in the morning and then I would drive to la and I would, I would work on the movie the rest of the time. It's pretty twisted, but it all worked out, you know. But you pretty much feel like you were done after you went to that shit hole, right? Yeah. But you just felt like you needed more treatment to cement it is like, what's the thought process, you know, like, uh, it's hard. It's hard

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       to explain to people that haven't been through it. Um, people have been through it. They know what it's like a, but addiction addiction is one of the most powerful forces in this universe. It's one of the, it's something that drives people everyday to do bad shit, you know, and continued support, right? Yeah. You basically just need. Yeah. Basically, like a lot of it's set off by trauma, like things that happened in your life. A lot of it's uh, you know, but I didn't really have that like one main trauma that like set it off. People go, well, your brother died. I was like, well that was, it wasn't as dramatic as it sounds like. It. Of course it's a traumatic but. But I was, I was doing stuff before that. So what was before that? I don't even know. Maybe the hip surgery didn't seem to me.

Speaker 3:          01:56:29       I think a big part of it for me was having the hip surgery took away something that I really loved, which was like lifting, you know, something that like, if you couldn't fight anymore, you'd fucking hate it. You know, you'd be like bombed, grumpy because there was a part of it just in your everyday life and now it's gone. Yeah, and it might sound stupid, but it's part is, it's something that you do, you know, if I said, hey joe, you know what, no more fighting bro. You're done. So you just felt like just a giant loss. You just felt like something was missing from your life and that's what led you to just start getting fucked up, fill it in with other stuff, you know. Wow. When you didn't think about maybe like trying something healthy and trying to engineer your life and sort of a way or we do something.

Speaker 3:          01:57:08       Okay. So when you take away working out what's healthy, what you couldn't do any working out? Not, I mean not a whole lot. Not, not like I used to and now that long, I mean just just for like years. I just, I just felt shitty, you know, I just didn't feel good. I'm the hips. Yeah. I think he also felt lonely too. I mean, you know, he, he, he didn't have her until more recently and even though our family is in California, you know, I have two children, so our parents moved to this. They were from New York originally. They moved to California, but we all live in northern California and when it came to like holidays and some different things, I mean we'd call them and communicate with them a little bit here and there. But you know, he kind of just seemed like he didn't give a fuck about.

Speaker 3:          01:57:49       Still in upstate New York. I know he's here. He's in La. Yeah. Yeah. So he was only in La and we were in Sacramento but um, it wasn't, you know, not that far. It's one hour flight or whatever. But we'd communicate with them here and there and just, you know, even like on his birthday or something, call them or whatever the case might be. Um, and then he would come up to Sacramento or I'd come down here and we'd meet up with each other here or there, but we just didn't really realize how severe the situation was in terms of just is like mental health, you know, it's just like not a dude thing to do. Like, hey man, how you doing? And somebody isn't just like poor out there fucking feelings were like, oh, I'm doing good. You know, they just leave it at that and you kind of move onto the next thing.

Speaker 3:          01:58:28       I have people that are in my film that have relapsed, you know, since the film. Um, and I have people that, I have a guy who, uh, I had to get a release for the film, like somehow somebody slipped up and didn't, didn't get released for the film and I'm just like, this is like two days ago, I have a guy who who relapsed and he's all fucked up. We're trying to get a release of the film. We can't even get in touch with them. So I did send somebody to his house and then we found out that he's relapsed and he's a mess and he needs treatment too. So it's like this, it's a dangerous, powerful thing. And, and part of the whole program is helping other people and I think it's beautiful. It's like the thing now is like, how do I help other people, how do I help?

Speaker 3:          01:59:07       The people will listen to this show and they will hit me up on facebook and they'll say, listen man, I'm an alcoholic. I'm a drug addict, drug addict, what do I do? And the beauty is I don't have to do it for them. I can just lead them in the right direction and help guide them to treatment and be there for them. The people that run these treatment centers, muscle, they must feel like they're like combating vampires or something. Everyone is just getting bitten and sick. It's, it's incredible. The second get sick is a good way of putting it. You know, like when somebody has something like that, you kind of feel like they have cancer or something and you don't know how to help him. I think I'm, a lot of people just think, oh, I can help him. Like hey, if we go like work out together, if we hang out together, if we go eat together, like that should be fun and like take his mind off it, but it doesn't work that way as soon as you turn back in a way.

Speaker 3:          01:59:53       I think also vampire. Yeah. I mean, and looking at it people say, oh it's not a news is your own fucking fault. Your own personal. Take all that away. Well, what's going on? Someone's got some shit in their veins and they need to keep pumping into their body. It's like sick. It is sick. You know what? All those same people that say it's not a sickness. And I like a lot of those people will fall into it too, you know, like, so. Well that's what's fucked up about it. How many people fall into it? I've had a lot of friends get hooked on pills. Chris Lievens in my movie. Busy. Yeah. Yeah. He's had some issues and has had some issues recently. I just spoke to him, um, a couple of days ago and he's, he's on a back on the suboxone and again, um, and, and it's hard to get off of that shit.

Speaker 3:          02:00:33       Like it's really hard to get off and it's like suboxone is a maintenance drug to keep them going back from doing, to do in the axes. But it's just something that like he's going to have to battle and fight everyday to get off. What are the numbers like how many people in this country are addicted to pain pills? I think it's like two point something million shuffled to shit. Fuck yeah. Well and then just how many people are just on pills period. I mean, I know some people, uh, some of the, you know, obviously some of the pharmaceutical drugs, so the benefit one, but you want a number, that's a real number. You want a number of million people are hooked on pain pills. People walking around like zombies say you had an idea to help people. Holy Shit, I'm just freaking out. I can't believe that's real. 2 million people are hooked on that Shit. Yeah, that's like a national epidemic. Absolutely. That's almost one percent of the population of the country. Last year I think 300 million people. I think that's, that's A. God damn it. 2 million fucking people. Three people is one percent in 2012. Like the Lazy Q, One hundred and 54 million. Two hundred $54 million

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       prescriptions were written for Vicodin. Fuck. So that, that's enough to Medicaid. Say that again. Say that number $254 million prescriptions for Vicodin were written in like last year or the year before. And that's enough drugs, that's enough painkillers to medicate every male or every. Every adult person in America for a month. So yeah, 250, $4 million. Here's another, another step. Four hundred and $54 million prescriptions were filled. Is that the idea for, for painkillers? Yeah. How does that even make sense? That's in a whole year and a whole year because people get several, so they get a bit windy pills or get a lot of times. It's like once a month, you know, they a lot of times with stuff like that, you want to get like 10 at a time though too. Well, here's another step for you. If you wanted to do something about it and you're a congressman, right?

Speaker 2:          02:02:31       And you're like, you know what? Fuck it. I'm going to do something about this epidemic. And then there's $445,000 sitting on your table. I can either take that money from lobbyists because on average that's how much money the lobbyists will take. On average, there's a certain amount of number of people in Congress and a certain amount of money that's spent. So if you average it out, it comes out to like over $400,000 per congressman that they use for their campaigns and everything else. So you can either take that money and just say, you know what, everything's cool, you know, or you can take that money and try to fight them and risk losing that money out of your campaign. So all these special interests and all these different things that people talk about all the time. A pharmaceuticals is one of the biggest ones to the one of the biggest contributors to these campaigns.

Speaker 2:          02:03:16       So people don't really have a vested interest to stop it. They have no interest. Right. I mean that's an any of. They weren't trying to fight it. If they fought it with that little amount of money, it wouldn't even fucking work there. Well, how, what amount of money would be affective? Yeah. Billions. Like it's so intense. What's really fucked up is this. This shit didn't even exist 50 years ago. Right. That's what's really fucked up. It didn't really exist 20 years ago or how nuts is that something. So we'll do. Twenty years ago they did have quail. Ooh, because the big bill cosby drugged right thing. But are they as addictive? They were a completely different thing. From what I understand. And this is just a total new level of addictive properties, right? Yeah. It's a. So if you, if you look at um, okay, so we have drugs like morphine, right?

Speaker 2:          02:04:05       Morphine and heroin are like really closely related. You can make one out of the other, right? Uh, but on the other side, they, they now make them synthetically. So this shit doesn't even require. They just chemical upon chemical upon chemical. It doesn't require any sort of a base. If you don't read, you don't need opium to make it, you need opium and morphine, but you don't need it to make oxycotton. So they figured out a way to make these things synthetically so that they can just, you know, I don't understand that well, how does that work? I don't understand it either. Like where are they getting the raw properties that would make it and I was happy, but I don't know what the fuck they make it from. But like you can't make something out of nothing physically. That's why I always understood. I didn't understand.

Speaker 2:          02:04:44       Like everyone said bullying, Afghanistan produces, you know, 90 whatever percent of the world's opium and heroin. But what about pills? If it's synthetic opium or synthetic heroin, what are they getting it from Afghanistan? Is that they've figured out ways special with ways to make it out of other things that are like normal basis and changes the chemical makeups of them somehow. I don't know exactly what. You're stupid for this conversation. So opiates, people goes, oh yeah, he's on opiates, but that's not really true. Unless he's on morphine, they're on opioids which are synthetic kinda like steroids, steroids, opioid. See all of that boils. Hemorrhoids. How strange band that we live in a world where 200 million prescriptions for super highly addictive pain pills to get prescribed in a year and we're supposed to be like an educated country. Think that like that's an epidemic for prescribing to the kids and we're giving kids, you know, adderall or given you the adderall, Ritalin.

Speaker 2:          02:05:45       And that's like, you know, 5 million prescriptions written for that for kids every year, you know, just keeps going up and up and up. It seems so easy to get shit too. I had a mom, I had to have a mom and my film and she has a daughter that has adhd and so she brings you to the psychiatrist or whatever and they prescribe her adhd pills, you know, adderall. And the mom starts taking it and then a mom convinces the daughter she doesn't have adhd and she shouldn't take it. So then the mom starts taking the other kids. There's three other kids. She took all her kids to the doctor and got like four prescriptions every month and was taken like tons of adderall. She would take like 10 a day. I bet that bitch got a lot done. Yeah. Houses clean, 2010 every American adult every four hours for one month. It says every prescription painkiller were prescribed to medicate every American adults for every four hours. What do you mean? What does that mean? You can't see that line? Well, why don't you make it so I can see it? Here's sorry. Oh, it's like. It's like, oh, there's the. There's the text of it. Okay. In 2000, 10 enough, prescription painkillers were prescribed to medicate every American adult every four hours for a month.

Speaker 2:          02:07:00       I wasn't lying Christ.

Speaker 2:          02:07:05       So. So it's like three pills a day or substance abusers. That's 2010. Now, has it gotten better or worse in five years? Well, it either way. You know that numbers when I talked about a purdue pharmaceuticals and oxycontin and how that invaded America and all that, stuff like that. If you look at it, the government, at some certain point I got fed up with it and I said, listen, people are dying, right? So it's cool that you guys are selling all these drugs and everything. We'll take your lobby money, but people are dying so you can't take this drug. You got to make a way that you can't take it and crush it up anymore and inject it or snort it or do other things with it recreationally. So now if you crush oxycotton, it turns into a Gel. It turns into like a Bush. So, uh, what they did was after seeing what happened, did they figured out how you couldn't crush it and snort it anymore? Once they did that, the sales dropped 80 percent.

Speaker 2:          02:08:02       So what does that tell you? It's 80 percent just shows you that anything is possible with money though. How the fuck did they figure out a way that if you crush it up, it turns into a gel. I don't know. Someone talked them into doing that and then they dropped 80 percent of their profits and they stuck with it. Yeah, they're probably fucking scramble. There are studies to show that that Gel is less effective, but they, they find they find other ways to the pills. But here's the problem. Here's the problem with a study, right? So everybody wants to think that they read the studies and the studies are good and the studies are valid and you know, what happens is you need to studies that prove that you're a pill is more effective than a placebo. Not effected, not more effective than anything that's on the market.

Speaker 2:          02:08:46       Just more effective than a placebo to get your drug past. So it takes, it costs a lot of money and a lot of money through the FDA and a lot of testing and all these things, but it's still not very hard to get a drug past. They just passed one called [inaudible]. I said [inaudible] I hydro and it's like way more powerful than oxycontin. So now there's another drug on the market that's more powerful. Who are these fucking monsters? How do we get some of that shit? Who are these monsters that are making this stuff? Does anybody need something stronger than Oxycontin? Some fucking rallying cry for pain pills to talk. You talk about like, um, medical marijuana. I talked to a senator about medical marijuana. Medical marijuana is not killing anybody. And, and I'm like, exactly. So, so is that something that's a, you know, good or bad, you know, and we look at it and go like, man, like it's, it's crazy what we could do with a plant compared to what's happening with, uh, you know, what's happening with these pills.

Speaker 2:          02:09:43       I don't know anybody. I know maybe one or two people that have ruined their life, you know, with pot, just because they're fucking lazy, but beyond that, beyond the scope of that, it seems to be very helpful for so many people. Yeah. My point of view has always been the, if you pot ruins your life just because pot got there first. Yeah. Exact cheeseburgers or scratch tickets or the fucking job as witnesses. Whoever gets to your commander and alcohol is the fucking worst. Alcohol's the devil. If you do any of them, if you indulge in it or you know you don't have the gene for it or whatever it is and that's not the worst. You just have a drink and then you don't want to have a drink anymore. Yeah. I've never had the urge to drink. I like a drink every now and then, but I've never had the urge is the same way, but I have friends who have it and I see it.

Speaker 2:          02:10:26       It hits them and it's like a blanket goes over their eyelids. It's like they vanish so they're not there anymore. And then some new persons and those are the people that you know are going to eventually have a problem if they don't already, if they don't already. Yeah. I definitely have known a lot of alcoholics and I know a lot of people like more, more than half a dozen people whose lives have been wrecked by pills. They just usually a back injury, you know, something along those lines. And then they take something and the next thing you know, they can't get off it. It's very innocent. You know, it's not a, it's not something that's. But it turns somebody who can be a great person and just somebody who lies, cheats and steals. And that's what's wrong with it. You know, the pills. Yeah. I always just used to think like, well if I could just be on these forever because I still have a lot of pain in my back and my hips.

Speaker 2:          02:11:13       And like not in the hips and the state, but like in the lower back because of the hips were messed up and because of my knees are messed up and solve a lot of pain. But I know that what happens with the pain pills are it's diminishing returns. Like after awhile I'll need, you know, for awhile it was, I had to take 12 percocets a day. What? Just to maintain the pain, the pain level that I, that I used to. How many hours do you awake? Yeah, like, well, you know, what's the other thing keeps you awake all day. Percocets. Keep you awake. Some people that go to sleep and some people stay awake all day. I would stay awake all day, but after awhile I got up to take in like 20. Right. And I taught day, so I thought that was bad. So my car, my car, my friend in the movie, I say to him, he's a, he was in a wwe wrestler.

Speaker 2:          02:11:57       Luther reigns. He's. I said, how many were you taking? A day goes 90. And he would say, I'd get up in the morning. My girlfriend would lay them out all out. It'd be like, you know, 10 Vicodin, 10 Salma. He taking muscle relaxers, painkillers. He said he, I even take a Viagra and cialis every morning with my vitamins. Like when you take that voice, it just to be ready, you know, is this because I'm such an asshole? Well, we're, we're, we're, we're in like, he's the coolest fucking guy ever. He's amazing, amazing. He's got some great stories. But I'm saying hilled up with a giant heart. So it tells me that a vampire with a boner at the time he lived in Phoenix and then Phoenix, they have cameras, you know, on the, uh, on the freeway. And uh, he was on, you know, someone makes you go to sleep.

Speaker 2:          02:12:45       It's a muscle relaxer. It makes it go to sleep. So he said he gets a ticket in the mail. He's like, what the fuck is this ticket? I never got a ticket being asleep. He opens up the ticket and there's a club plain as day it's fucking passed out. Speed is driving. And in his corvette going, you know, 95 and [inaudible] 65 asleep, asleep. He got the ticket. He's like, I wonder, we get a ticket for being asleep. God, I don't think it really is what's going on with him now. He had a massive, massive stroke. He had a cardiac Arrhythmia, um, I don't know what you call that. He had something wrong with his heart to begin with, uh, all the pills and sorta live in live in the tough life because he did a lot of illegal drugs to, uh, he had a stroke and drugs.

Speaker 2:          02:13:29       He didn't do what he did, like coke and everything. Hop of it. Right. So, um, but what happens is like he, he was getting them on the black market. He said that he used to get a thousand at a time. Big, big bottles. Yeah. Thousand. Oh my. He told me he was selling, selling, selling. Uh, he had a customer that was buying them at $28,000, like a week. So he, he had to get massive, massive amounts. So he was dealing, um, and goddamn thousand dollars worth the pills and need a fucking forklift for selling them. Two guys in the NFL, you know them to the Phoenix cardinals. That's insane. You know, it wasn't a, it wasn't a rush. Limbo taken like 90 a day. I was taking a lot. Anyway. So my friend, uh, luther reigns, he ended up, he had a massive stroke and uh, now he's actually somehow.

Speaker 2:          02:14:21       So when, when you have withdrawals from painkillers, it feels like you're gonna die. And so when he had the stroke, they said, get his mother here, he's not going to make it through this and we can't pump them full of full of enough drugs for him to get through this. He's gonna. He's probably not going to make it somehow miraculously the part of the, uh, the brain that is, he is like 30 percent of his brain got killed during the stroke. Part of the brain that got killed was the part that was responsible for feeling withdrawals. So somehow he fucking dodged a bullet. We call him the bulletproof bad boy. Somehow he got the bullet, he's alive. He has no more hangovers. He's completely sober and he goes around and talks to kids and churches and things like that. So he's doing great work, you know.

Speaker 2:          02:15:07       So he lost 30 percent of his brain. Yeah. But somehow he's still a cognitive. He's still, you know, he's still there. He's jacked. He's on steroids. Yeah. Oh, good Christ maybe might be something. Yeah. So he's off the pain pills on steroids and helping our kids. Yeah, there you go. What the fuck? Kind of a world we live in. I love that. One day we were eating with them, uh, that we're grabbing a burger or something and he's, he's got this fanny pack on. He's like pulling stuff out. He's trying to find his money, you know, he's like, oh, I'll pay for it bro. And he's like moving in slow motion. He's fucking drooling. I'm like, this guy is amazing. What is going on with this guy? He's putting all these different bottles of pills on the table. He's got like Viagara and a bunch of other shit and carries the bottom with them.

Speaker 2:          02:15:56       Yeah. And then he put like his fanny pack yet. Well there's Bob tools, the many bottles and then he puts down like a little bag, like a clear bag of something and he's like, he looks at it and he grabs money clip and he puts his money on the table and it looks at the clear baggies like, whoops. And he puts that back, whatever the fuck that was, that was like, that wasn't okay for him to put on the table. Everything else was fine. For some reason. He like, oops. Big Old stack of cash. That's so crazy. Oh yeah. He's, Oh my God. I was like, dude, what if you get like your pills mixed up, like you're just running a ton of fucking Viagra and shit. Like when maybe when he was passed out in the car and maybe he was driving with his Dick.

Speaker 2:          02:16:37       Yeah, maybe just amazing bar. There was no blood in his brain. It's amazing because he was, he was dating a porn star for a long time. And so now he's like a born stars here. Fucking movie. Premiere was amazing. Yeah. Yeah. Bigger, stronger, faster. You brought two porn stars. Two chicks making out right behind my parents. I was like the weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life. What a good guy. He's awesome. He's a lot of fun. So now that he's a born again Christian, he'll be like telling me, look, look bro, now that you're sober, now you need God. And He'd be like, look at this chick's tits that just texted me. It's like such a contract. Walking, walking contradiction. He's hilarious now. So what if anything can be done about this crazy prescription drug crisis? Because it seems like when you, when you're talking about millions of people that were on, it was the number 8 million people abuse it every year.

Speaker 2:          02:17:26       8 million people. What is that? Is that like three percent of the population in the country? Somewhere around there was pretty big. We listen, we ran a million people, right? So nine would be three percent, right? Jesus Christ, they will point seven, $6 million in 2010. So what is it? Lot. I wonder what percentage of people are adults? It might literally be three percent of the population of the whole country is fucked up on prescription pain pills. Well, here's the deal too. Like we represent. We only represent five percent of the entire world's population. We consume 75 to 85 percent of the world's prescription drugs. That's a lot of drugs because we're America, we do it big America. Yeah. So if you want to see like what, what can be done about it? Um, first of all, like just ban advertising on tv for drugs because that just creates an environment where people go into the doctor and tell them what they have a doctor as a fucking doctor, a doctor went to school, all you did, all you did was watch a commercial, you know, that's advertised.

Speaker 2:          02:18:26       Do you have toenail fungus or you know, all these stupid things. So that creates a drug culture and idea that there's a pill for everything. I think that that idea is an idea that needs it to go away. You know, there's not, there is a pill for everything, but let's not think that way. Let's say you tired. Are you sad? Yeah, let's talk about me. Well, and that's one thing, but I think also just like education is the most important thing that we can have for anything. Whether it's steroids, whether it's prescription drugs, but you say that you say that, but yeah, you were educated. You, you knew the, all the pitfalls. You had a brother who died of it. You had been hooked on it yourself, you've been doing a documentary about all the, all the different components of addiction of, of selling these pills, and yet you still got sucked into the web. Yeah, exactly. That's how powerful it is. So it's so crazy because you're, you, but you are about as educated about it as a person can be. I think now I am. But back then when you were making the documentary, don't you think you are way more educated than. I was way more.

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       I'm educated. I was already already susceptible to it. I was already. I had already been in, you know what I mean? So that, that's a tough thing. It's like if you can get, get somebody before, uh, before they ever experienced it, that's definitely a warning signs. Maybe before you get to that point of like reaching for a pill. We mean other warning sounds like, like, like something that happens before you actually start to take pills or do drugs. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, was always sorta gateways, drinking and other things that make it. Mark. Was it like for you to have two brothers that have these polls but you don't? My family is fucked up, but you know, I mean, you obviously like steroids, but I love them. They're great, but you don't have like the self destructive thing going on. Like you seem like a real generous guy.

Speaker 3:          02:20:15       You are a real generous guy. Just the fact that you have this free gym and these free seminars and I saw in the, in the documentary that you really love working with kids and helping them out. Like what is it? Yeah. Um, I think I'm seeing my older brother, I'm like, um, he just like his life was uh, his life was really hard and he had to like evade stuff and lie and like go through all these crazy things all the time because pills because of the pills and then it also put a lot of heartache and stuff on a lot of other people. So it sort of made me go the other direction. You know, like sometimes people have a parent that's an alcoholic or apparent that abuses them and it makes that person go the complete opposite way and then other times you have someone who has a parent that's an alcoholic and they end up becoming the same thing.

Speaker 3:          02:21:04       I think for me it just made me steer clear of that. I just remember like seeing my brother, like hide alcohol, like in, in bushes and shit like that from my parents and lie to my parents and my parents are are as bad as awesome a parents as you can have. So that was always just like, man, it just seems like a lot of extra work to go through. Even if you told them that you were having a drink, they probably wouldn't care. Not like they would be like, hey, go for it man. They're not going to be like your buddy and have a drink with you. But at the same time I don't think our parents would really care. Especially if they were like in the house, they'd probably be like, fuck it man. I'd rather have you do an it hearsay if you're not.

Speaker 3:          02:21:38       No, you're not driving, causing a lot of other problems, so I just saw like a lot of, a lot of baggage that came with all that shit and you didn't see that. I saw it as I completely saw, like I said, getting the hip to hip replacement thing and getting hooked on pills in a way that seemed to me to be a organic, you know, it wasn't like uh, like my brother started taking pills because he got hurt in wrestling and then he. But did he really, you know, it's like, I don't know if he ever got a prescription for it. They were just passed around there are passed around so much and in wrestling that it was such a huge problem. So for me I was like, well I'm taking them legitimately. And then it just was a snowball effect because the doctor tells you it's okay.

Speaker 3:          02:22:18       It was a real snowball effect from the squat when you fucked up your ankle and your knee when you drop that weight. I'd take a little bit of stuff just because it was just unreasonable not to like I just physically could not get up off the couch. You just in agony. And then uh, just talked to one of my buddies at the gym. I'm like, dude, like a, I was like a need some stuff so I can fucking move around. So you just getting it from the gym? I'm gonna yeah, I'm in a lot of that. That's where everything comes from. That's so crazy. You guys don't ever go to doctors say like when I, when I talk about the hip surgery, I mean it felt like my, my right side that they botched for two years. It felt like it was on fire and so, I mean if you're a buyer, you got to put that out.

Speaker 3:          02:23:00       Right? So that's. And then by the time you ready to get off of it, you're just so addicted. I also told my friend though too, I was like, dude, like I'm going to come back to you for more. Don't get me. Don't fucking. Don't give me any more. So give me like an amount that you think is like reasonable cause my friend. What did you take a. I don't even know. I don't even remember exactly what it was. Whatever it was. It worked pretty good though. Just don't know. Take two or how much you tell a whatever. Yeah. Yeah. This takes some for a few. Oh my God. Um, I also, uh, would also steered me clear of a lot of stuff, at least as I got in a little bit older is I met my wife, like, you know, we've been married for almost 15 years now and been together for about 17 years and I have children.

Speaker 3:          02:23:41       I got a lot of responsibility. So like even if I want to get fucked up, like I don't have time to like go do it really. Right. And you've got a lot of obligations. Your brother didn't have any kids now married. He didn't listen. You don't have any kids? Not all kids wonder if that's it. Whenever it's the responsibility of the children just keeps you just having somebody, somebody else in my life that cares about me, somebody else sets a supportive and you know, she's uh, as much as part of the company's success as I am. So all that definitely plays into it. That's such a scary number of the eight point 7 million people that are abusing it and that been 2010 and not knowing what it is in 2015. That's terrifying to me. That's the idea that we could be in that state and it's sort of like something that flies under the radar for the most part unless you know somebody and then you think of that person is an isolated incident here you think of that person's crazy or that person's doing it.

Speaker 3:          02:24:33       Then like you said, doing it to themselves and you know, like there is definitely personal responsibility in all of this. Whether whatever it is. But um, but at a certain point when things are so addictive that people don't really know about it or the doctors are just handing them out like crazy for a while. A couple years ago, and they shut these all down. There were pill mills, so you just, they call them pill mills and people would come from West Virginia drive all the way down to Florida just to get pills, you know. So am I, my friend that we were talking about before luther, he just said he would, he'd have seven prescriptions and he's like, my whole day would be driving around to different, different pharmacies picking up different prescriptions. Now they have this drug database that if you get a prescription from walgreens, you can't go to costco and get that prescription however nobody really uses it. So we have to get. That's another way to get.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       Nobody uses it. Yeah. Like the, they have a plus, you know, the dea regulates how many of these drugs are made and there's way more drugs made than are actually needed. So a lot of those fall off the truck and you know, different things happen where they retained. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's built into the system is a massive, massive, massive money making system and everybody's on the take. What the fuck. A lot of money be made and it's killing people like vampires. Yeah. But we have a war on drugs. Are there really vampires vampire to me, as I say in the book and the film. Is there really a war on drugs was a warrant. Some drugs. That's what there's always been, right? Yeah. While, while we had a Nancy Reagan, you know, up there saying just say no. Her husband's a lifting the bands on big business that allowed the pharmaceutical companies that grow so big.

Speaker 2:          02:26:17       Wow. So this documentary then, the newest one, what takes place in it that you found was shocking? Like what? What was going through this journey of putting together this documentary? Was there anything that shocked you? Yeah, a lot of the numbers. But also, um, I interviewed this woman, Gwen Olson went Olsen used to be a pharmaceutical sales rep that uh, quit when her daughter killed herself on psych meds and um, it's her stories just insane. And just meeting somebody who actually worked through the system to to know that the people in the pharmaceutical companies get pumped up when they have a new drug coming out that can actually fix the side effects of another drug they already have on the market. And they're so excited because I know how much money they're gonna make off of this. It's just like sickening. The whole thing is, is disgusting and sickening and it's not about health.

Speaker 2:          02:27:13       And that's what I really learned. Worry is terrifying. It was stopped. Has it's such a machine that's making so many billions of dollars. How do you stop it and how do you level it out? You know, I think people that stopped taking money from pharmaceutical companies, that's a big thing. You know, they have Donald Trump running and half the people are like, Oh God, Donald Trump. But you know, that's something that's not going to play into his decision making. You know? So if people like that, I'm not saying him specifically, but people like that to say, you know what? I'm not going to take their money. I don't care what they say. I'm not going to take, you know, it's the same thing with oil or any of these other problems like we, the way we fix problems is not to bribe congressmen, you know, I think that that's a huge thing and a huge thing is for regular average everyday citizens to say no to a, to what's going on and stop and, you know, write to their congressman and make us think if all this stuff like people wanted medical marijuana, medical marijuana, it didn't come about because some congressmen said, you know what, I'm going to make.

Speaker 2:          02:28:12       This took a long time. It took a long time. It took a massive movement of a massive amount of people to say we want this. And uh, you know, if you at a food, for example, a, everything's sort of going organic, it's easier to find. As hard as it is sometimes to find good food. It's also a lot easier than it used to be. So that's like Costco. Costco is like all going organic now because people want it. So if people want, you know, a drug free society, a society where their kids aren't dying and killing each other over drugs, a society where people can live in peace and harmony and not have their families ruined by these problems, they can, they can basically start that front, you know, just like they did with all these other things. That's a groundswell, you know, it's like something that has to start.

Speaker 2:          02:28:56       It just, I just don't know how you would ever stopped that amount of money. It seems like the amount of money is so fucking terrifying and that these companies can just live with themselves. It's, it's so bizarre. They can justify the production of these fucking pills when they know that 9 million people or whatever the number is or abusing them just in this country with a massive amount of the drugs on the market and pharmaceuticals, you know, they don't even work know they, they had been proven. They, they're not proven effective. The psych meds that we put, we put our kids on were never tested on kids. So if it's not tested on a kid, don't give it to my kid. That's what people need to start saying, but people say, you know what, it's easier for. I put my kid on. Everybody wants to make the exception.

Speaker 2:          02:29:38       Every parent I talk to says, yeah, yeah, but my kids different [inaudible] I put them on adderall and now he's fine rather than to search out all the other, you know, all the other options. So then people want to try to solve stuff with money or with or with a pill rather than with their time. You know, that's a big, big issue. If your child has trouble in school, maybe maybe your kid just has trouble in school. I fucking sucked in school. It doesn't. It doesn't really. Each person is going to have their own different thing. They're going to be good and bad at it. You don't necessarily need a pill to try to solve that problem all the time. Yeah, and school is fucking gross. The idea of sitting in a classroom, especially with some fucking teacher that's unmotivated, sit there and you're just supposed to absorb this fucking hours on end.

Speaker 2:          02:30:19       There's a lot of data that's just. They're not designed for that yet. They would thrive doing something in life. You just have to figure out what that something is. They can absolutely contributed to just not care about geometry or not care about history or not care about whatever it is that's uninspired. Sometimes it's the the teacher. Some teachers get excited about anything fun to be around. Creativity is more important than knowledge. That's like Albert Einstein, right with him, you know, he was always a had trouble in school, learning, disabled, diagnosed with all these learning disabled, put in a class with the kid that the kids that eat glue and all that stuff. Like the typical case of that, you know, and he's become very successful off of a passion. Yeah. If you just find what it is you're really good at. I mean there's just. People have different personalities and there's different occupations.

Speaker 2:          02:31:08       You just got to figure out what works for you, but all that aside, it just. The sheer numbers of the drugs is what's freaking me out in this conversation. This almost seems like a, like some crazy plague that no one's talking about disease, a disease, a disease. It's just spreading across the country and that we're all kind of silent about it until it's too late and there's no vaccine, it's just nothing. That's why he was so excited to come on the show, you know, to be able to talk about it and get, get more information out there. And then when does your film come out to? My film will come out in the fall. It's not, we haven't announced the release date yet, but Samuel Goldwyn is the one that's putting it out on Samuel Goldwyn company, so they'll get a theatrical release and it'll get it, you know, a big digital release.

Speaker 2:          02:31:53       So we're excited about that. Will let me know when that happens and I'd be happy to tweet about it and let everybody know about it and put it up on facebook and one God. Damn. So do you do these yourself? Is this your own project? Do you storyboard amount you like you? And it's a little crazy. Um, so I did bigger, stronger fat, you know, I went to USC film school when I was trying to make films for years and we all struggled trying to like make it, you know, in, in these different endeavors, whether it be acting or filmmaking or anything. So, uh, I was struggling for years writing a bunch of scripts, getting really close, you know, how it is, you're really close to getting something made. And you know, finally, after awhile, like nothing was happening and I said, if anything in life is going to happen for me, I need to make it happen.

Speaker 2:          02:32:37       I can't be sitting here waiting for somebody to go, you know, what, I really liked your script. I'm going to make it or blah, blah, blah blah. So long story short, a bigger, stronger, faster was the brain child of, of me and my partner is Alex Bono and Tamsin Bono. They were um, a couple that, uh, you know, had experienced with documentaries and stuff like that. And just through conversations with them were like, fuck it, let's go make this on our own. So we raised all the money, we went out and we made it on her own. Uh, the second film I did was called trophy kids. I did that with Peter Berg was the executive producer of that and that was a film that because a bigger, stronger, faster pizza, like, hey, I want to work with you. So we did a movie about crazy sports parents.

Speaker 2:          02:33:17       I ended up on a hbo and that'll be actually be available on demand on November 17th. That'll be coming out on demand everywhere. But if you have hbo go, you can watch a trophy. Kids, it's called trophy kids are the extended version is one. We actually did a Pete Berg use it as a part of his show called state of play. Um, so that ended up serving two purposes. We got distribution for a movie we thought was really cool and uh, he got a pilot for a TV show. So that's available on hbo go now. Yeah. Trophy kids is basically, uh, it's, it's so fucking weird. We just came here and we have this tennis mom that's in, that's in trophy kids and she's like, this really like a godly Jesus Freak. Uh, and we just saw her at the restaurant. We just say that before when we came here, I haven't seen her in like two years since we did the movie.

Speaker 2:          02:34:05       But yeah, though that film's really interesting because parents nowadays are really putting the pressure on their kids to succeed. Well, I think they always have, but now there's so much money involved in sports, getting scarier investments. Oh, and the kids, the kids aren't any good. You know, bottom line is like if a kid's good, they're going to make it, you know what I mean? Like no amount of investing in their quarterback skills is gonna, you know, it'll help some kids get maybe over that hump. But then are you going to beat John Jones? Yeah. In Reality John Jones is going to be John John's coming out of the womb, you know, killing you. You know? That's. Yeah, that's the thing about the trophy kids or the thing about parents that are really into that. That's always disturbing is it seems like they're trying to live their lives, their failures through the kid, like they want to sort of reimagine their own life and have some success through, through the kids' work.

Speaker 2:          02:34:54       I have a basketball dad who's like, you know, he'll say, I say, do you think you're living vicariously through your son? Because like, not vicariously man directly. I mean every shot in each move in each go. And that's why the referees make me want to pull my hair out or my case make me pulled their hair out. It's like you're listening to this going, you're fucking crazy. Your mind, you know, and, and it's just normal behavior to these people. It's this everyday behavior. I said, how much did you spend on your son, uh, on your son's basketball career? And he, he goes, I said, I'd say two lamborghinis easy. And who, who measures their wealth and lamborghinis. First of all, that's weird with the, um, did you see this story on a Todd Marinovich? Yeah. Timer intervention, which is another similar story, but to the extreme is a great movie that a espn did as part as part of the 30 for 30, which I actually pitched them that be at, pitched them that before they did it so that somebody else had pitched it like I guess right around the same time.

Speaker 2:          02:35:52       Um, and they did a great job with. I thought it was awesome. Yeah. And it's a very disturbing story, but it's also an, it really highlights the problem because here you've got a guy who's like an all time, great nfl strength and conditioning coach understands the science of strength and conditioning and, and, and preparing someone for a sport almost better than anybody. And he has a kid and he says, you know what? Listen, I got fucking project now. Turn this kid into. And it worked. But meanwhile the kid didn't want to do it and it became a heroin addict. I became an artist. He's like, I don't want to do it. And I think that's what happens when he pushed kids too much. Like a kid kinda has to find out how talented thing. How talented Todd Marinovich is. I've spoken with them several times. He's actually cool.

Speaker 2:          02:36:36       Really super cool guy. He told me he went and played in arena football league game and he was withdrawing from heroin so bad that he had shit his pants and he had thrown 10 touchdown passes with shit in his pants. Oh my goodness. He just like, it was so easy for me. He's like, footballs easy man. It's just like, it's just like numbers. Don't leave them. Boom. Won a heisman trophy. Didn't know he was close up for it. I think his dad is a fucking freak man. His Dad did an amazing job with Bj Penn to. Yeah, and it's his dad's a freak man. Is that they think they've made amends with all that stuff. It's just hard to do it to your own kids. You can do it to somebody else's kid and make them a fucking machine, but you're not the. You also

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       don't want know what your kid wants. I think like at a young age, I think todd Marinovich said, I want to be in the nfl, but what kid doesn't say that? You know? Well, not only that, what kid doesn't change his mind when he becomes 16 or 18, there's a certain side of it too. They'll look at the dad. You know, I was influenced heavily by my older brother. I wanted to be, I want it to be like, yeah, I want, wanted to be like theater and drama. I wanted to do these other things that are considered like, oh, you're a Pansy, what are, you know. And, and so those things through the culture I grew up in was like, you're not tough if you do those things. We did when we were kids. It was gay, it was considered soccer's gay. That's gay. So what, when I wanted to like, you know, what I had like a passion to make films and do that stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:37:57       It was sort of hard to tell everybody like, hey man, I'm not really, I don't really care that much about lifting anymore. I want to go this way, you know, or whatever. It's that, that stuff's weird, you know? Well, bigger, stronger, faster is available. It's been available for a long time. Um, but trophy kids available right now on hbo go and when is this new one coming out? It shouldn't be out in like the late fall. We don't have a release date, fall prescription thugs. When I'll, I'll help you promote it. I'll absolutely take you about it on twitter and you can get ahold of mark, mark smelly bell on instagram and twitter, twitter and instagram. And big, strong. Fast is Chris is Chris is handle. Would you have an instagram too? Yeah, at big, strong, fast, big, strong, fast and instagram as well. Even though I'm not none of them anymore. I shaved my balls for this interview, so I appreciate it. I'm glad you did that. I shaved my last night. Awesome. Nice feeling to know that someone else in the room shares prepped my shorn ball. All right, well thank you guys. Have a fun conversation. I really appreciate it and very enlightening and terrifying and a lot of ways to. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. See you guys tomorrow. Bye. Bye.

Speaker 4:          02:39:05       Oh Man.

Speaker 5:          02:39:15       Shut up.
