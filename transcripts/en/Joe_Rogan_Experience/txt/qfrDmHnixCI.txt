Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       We're live. Good googly Mowgli. Jeff Ross, push that fucker up to your face and say hello to the world. Hello world. Are you taking off the, you know, know headphones or you grab all your Rabel. You don't give a fuck. You look great. You look great as well. Fellow black belt in Tae Kwon.

Speaker 2:          00:00:25       I saw a picture of you and you're a little kid. Somebody posted it up on my message board. He wouldn't be like the youngest black belt in New Jersey or something crazy like that. Yeah. Second. Yup. Second in the country. He fucking savage. You were dropping some, uh, some knowledge about all of this. Uh, we, we started the podcast up quick. Look at that. Look at that fucking wow. That's bad ass little kid. I never knew that. I'm a 10 and a half in that picture. Right. Chop and pitches. Am I still a blackbelt Joe? Technically, if it doesn't fit around my waist anymore, you are s you have earned it. Whether or not you were at black belt level or not, that's debatable. But you have earned your black belt so you are a black belt. It's like the marine. I love that. Once you go black, you never go back.

Speaker 2:          00:01:06       Um, we were talking, we started the podcast up abruptly because, uh, we were talking about, um, how do you, wait, one question for you. How do you think being a black belt is affected your comedy? My, I don't, I don't know. None. Not at all. I don't think I would have the confidence to talk shit if I didn't get a black belt early on. Really? Yeah. It probably helps something come on of course. Sure. And that way out about it. Well definitely helps. Like you not be worried about confrontation as much? Well, at least. Yeah. Oh, for sure. Like having that, uh, what do they have around Israel? Cone of silence? No, the uh, the Dome, something they have a dome is like a defense system. Oh, I see. Right, right, right. So you have a defense system in place. It might be a little rusty and a little, you know, in need of some tuna, but it's there.

Speaker 2:          00:01:58       Well, anybody that would, most of the time, anybody that would hackle you or think about attacking you, usually they're so fucking stupid. Like the vast majority of hecklers are so God damn dumb. But I've been around so many people that can kick my ass. I'm don't feel very confident it'll work in for the UFC. I'm just constant around people that could just fuck me up anytime. I've just don't feel very confident. I like with regular people maybe, but to some to humbled by my job with a bunch of fighters. Yeah. What have you been doing with them? Joe? Daddy Stevenson. Yeah. Joe Stevenson Mentor and like fighting coach for the show kingdom MMA fighters and underground scene. That's a direct TV show, right? [inaudible] on that towns on it. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool that directv is doing their own programming. It's nice. It's like there's so many different avenues for programming now. It's pretty fucking bad. Make show and then they show the show and now it's on iTunes and I'm on the next season. It's a cool thing because it's fun to see the fight world get dramatized. It's like Friday lights

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       for uh, for fights. Right. Are there good scenes though? Like very aggressive. Yeah, of course. As a fan you're going to, fans would roll their eyes and go, how realistic could be, I've only been to one fight. It was the one you and Ari invited me to. Which one was that? You mean Coover few years back and a have to think of who was, might've been turned. That sounds like, I think it was Jon Jones, was it John? John Kerry, John Jones and Gustafson. Was that Vancouver? My jaw was dropping at the blood. It's crazy. Never been. So now these fight scenes we should at night. So it's very realistic and it's surprisingly authentic. It's all real fighters and boxers fighting the actors on this show. Nick Jonas music superstar. When the Jones brothers on the show, not one of the Jonas brothers, like the guy who's got the number one music career right now is also playing a fighter and he's a total bad ass.

Speaker 3:          00:03:53       And I know it sounds crazy, but he's ripped. He's in these scenes for six, seven hours a night, two, three nights in a row shooting these, just the fight scenes. Then the next day or all day he's got to do like actual dramatic acting. But the files are really well done. They're, they're raw. People get hurt. There's a lot of real blood mixed with the acting blood. You know right here. Look at his fucking Stud. I'm telling you man, I was so impressed. Looks like Tj Walberger I play a sleazy promoter that hires him even though he's uh, out of medical leave from fighting. It's a handsome bastard. Does he actually know martial arts? He is very believable as a fighter. Like some of the fighters said he's as good. Joe Daddy actually told me this. I don't know if I'm supposed to, but he thinks he's as good as some of the fighters that they have come train them. Really? That if he was fighting, he would beat this guy for real. Like he was doing the senior of the night. And that's what Joe Daddy, that gay scene right there, right there that's going on right there. That looks like, I dunno what's going on,

Speaker 2:          00:04:59       whatever. By the time they get under hooks to fight him off, get that right under hook. It's a very intense show. There's a lot of tears. And is that a drugs and fucking, are those tattoos on his arm or is he just like really in a tape? What is, what is that? As soon as thing bro, like duct tape up before I leave my house, Bro. I think he's taped up. It's a bad technique, right? They're getting a little upset about being naked. Choke technique. What's he doing with his right hand? Why isn't it behind the guy's head? You are not watching a sanction clip from the show. I'm watching. This is what I do when I'm fucking, I think you're watching this John Long wash to start questioning your sexuality. Alan, you catch have done that, but I don't quite sync the choke in. You've started fuck staring at Nick Jonas getting choked out for almost three minutes now. Hypnotize. It's like one of those fucking clocks. Tick Tock, tick tock. Hamu

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       I'm getting so if you ever been hypnotized, no, I got hypnotized reasonably for the first time ever. Was very interesting. Yeah. This guy who uh, Vinny shoreman, it's been on the podcast, he hypnotize a lot of fighters, da. He's like kind of a mind coach, knows a lot about like uh, how to uh, eliminate barriers that people have set up. I could send them to you buddy kicked this fucking cigarette habit, get you on the road to recovery. But um, it's very interesting because when you get hypnotized you're aware of what's going on. You're totally aware, but you are definitely in some sort of fucking weird dreamland. Very strange. Where you completely sober? 100%. Yeah. 100% sober sitting on the couch. Was it just the adventure where you're trying to cure something? Why? I'm curious cause I wanted to know what, cause I know a lot of fighters have used it and had very good results.

Speaker 4:          00:06:48       Like it's alleviated a lot of anxiety with them, giving them a lot of confidence and they've attributed to a lot of their positive performances. It's not foolproof. Better man always wins every time, you know. And sometimes fighters who don't have a mind coach will still beat fires that have a mind coach. But I think all things said, if you add all the different things that a fighter has to be aware of, you have to be in shape. You have to know your techniques, you have to be, you know, motivated. It's a lot of stuff going on in a fighter's head that it has to be lined up properly and a mind coach, not a bad idea. Having someone who can hypnotize you and give you a tenants to live by and pathways that you could follow that are positive. I think that's fucking super important for, for anybody, for fighters, for anybody.

Speaker 4:          00:07:33       So I just wanted to try it. I wanted to see when I see if what it does for fighting can actually, you'll actually do for stand up. Did you trust this guy? Did you notice hypnotists? Like he didn't pay any crazy things that you make chicken noises, but no, no. It was just, uh, I mean I wasn't, it wasn't like, you know, take your pants off. Suck my deck. It wasn't like Addie. No, I know. It wasn't because I was awake the whole time like you're awake. It's a weird feeling man. It's like you're, you're, you're listening to him but it's almost like you're in a room and he's coming in over a loudspeaker and your, your eyes are closed. That's what it feels like. It's very strange. Very strange there. Anything you can compare it to? Is it yoga? Is it like, no, it's like a little bit like a, something that might happen in a sensory deprivation tank because it seems like you go into this weird alternate state and that's a sort of how he describes it, that you're, you're actually entering into an alternate state of consciousness and like I'm a different mind state.

Speaker 4:          00:08:31       Very, very interesting stuff. I was always curious because you ever seen a r rated hypnotist? The guys that are really good, you ever see Frank Santos wasn't, he was on, I remember him in Boston. Yes. She's the best. Who's the best? That guy can seem creepy to me. Like he had the hottest wife imaginable and he looked like a frog and he knocked it out of the park. Who's a great guy though. I just kept looking at her trying to think of whatever the that say the code

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       word was, snap her out of it. Just tickles randomly Graham crackers just to see what she's like, why don't you, I'm married to who? Wait, wait. I was at a corporate party. What happened? No, I'm married to a hypnotist. He would have guys come in their parents all the time. He would a, this is back when Madonna was hot. It was like the 1980s and he had some guy and he, the guy was like doing pushups on stage and he told them, now Madonna's underneath you and she's naked and you're having sex with her and you could see the guy literally thank, he was having sex with Madonna and he would come, Jesus, are you going to go back, have more suicides like sessions and like tried to do it again. I would definitely do it again. The hypnotizing thing, I think I would do it again.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       Vinnie lives in England, so he's only a here occasionally. But uh, if I found someone that was good that was in this area, I would do it. I think there's something videotape it though. Right? So creeped out. I'm not scared. Yeah, I'd be her scope. That shit. At least I have to suck your Dick. Blotching did it from their phones and their car fall asleep at the wheel and drive out in the trap. But they all fall asleep along with me. Wait, why haven't, why hasn't it like a TV show? If hypnotism does exist or like, and it's true, why hasn't a TV should done that? Like, like have like a 15 minute opening where they just hypnotize everyone that's watching it. It's good. Yeah. Actually you should do it. That's how the Jonestown massacre started. You know what? Skype hypnotizing is a way a cult. You could get a group of people to sacrifice to a crime. He does stuff over Skype. There's probably laws, there should be anti hypnotism laws for more than small groups of people. I don't know if it works like that. What if Hitler was just a hypnotist, that those big crowds, he's like, fuck it.

Speaker 4:          00:10:52       Don't you think that when you're staying, you're onstage and you're killing when you're locked in? Don't you think? That's kind of a sense, like sort of a massive gnosis and a lot of ways, don't you feel like that? Like that? I never thought about it that way, but I could see that. You know how like when you're in the middle of your material and you're locked in, you're tuned into the audience, the audience is tuned in to you and they're kind of thinking like you're thinking. I feel that way when I watched somebody, if I watch somebody really good, so I'm like, I'll watch bird the other night. He was hilarious. And I feel like when you watch someone is really good, you're tuning in to what they do. Like you're, you're, you're in their head, like they're in your head, I guess more. And you're like, you're just kind of a, like an empty vessel and your brain is filled up with their ideas.

Speaker 4:          00:11:34       And when someone's captivating, especially like d as the other, I had this fucking Cosby bit that was killing me, fucking killing me. And when he's doing it, you're thinking the way he thinks. Like your eyes are open, you're anticipating what he's going to say. You don't have any room in your head for anything else. Like you're thinking the way he's thinking. Got, he's inside your head. He's hypnotizing entire crowd. He's taking you for a ride. Even if you didn't believe weren't with them. Now you are. Yeah. He's taking you for a ride. He's taking you for a ride and a lot of ways he's on the same ride. You know? I always feel that way too. Like a lot of ways, I've always said this, that when I'm at my best, I'm as much of a passenger as I am a driver, you know, I kind of have to make the turns and steer the car and figure out which way the bits are going to go. But when I'm locked in, I feel like I'm just riding it like it's, I just have to get out of my own way. You know? Until you feel like that

Speaker 3:          00:12:27       I can understand being on a role and not thinking how's this going or what should I do? Just talking your as if you're talking to your buddy in the back seat of your car.

Speaker 4:          00:12:38       Well especially your style too because you like to fuck with people. Right and so when you're fucking with people you're coming out of nowhere. I mean you just pulling them out of the universe.

Speaker 3:          00:12:47       Yeah. I remember hearing once how important there was an article a long time ago, maybe it was in a book about late night hosts and you have to listen. Just as soon as I stopped trying to think of jokes and just started to listen and trust that whatever I said would be entertaining in some way. Eventually if I just stay in it and just listen to the other person. If, if a funny character is presented in front of me, if someone's boring, you might have to try to write a joke on the spot and your head, but if they're an interesting person you could just talk to them and eventually it's going to land on something funny.

Speaker 4:          00:13:25       Yeah, that is a problem with some comics is that they're so in their own head. They don't listen to the person they're talking.

Speaker 3:          00:13:30       I had a lady on stage in Chicago and so speed roasting the crowd and Gosh, she was like a really round person with a crazy yellow Mohawk way over the top. And she was tiny little thing but built like a little mailbox, the big mouth, just a funny, funny body. And she came on, just threw herself up on stage one or to be roasted. And I was like, uh, you said a lot of, a lot of people, I think I said a lot of people couldn't pull off that outfit and you're two of them. I don't know what the Shit, I'm relearning a crime with a fond memory. He came to you out of nowhere. Uh, I got to remember the joke. We came to you and they're like, yeah, you're just listening and boom. That's the home run that people remember because it wasn't thought about ahead of time was just listening to the looking. And you know, when you're roasting people listening is also looking like taking a good look at assessing exactly what's been put in front of you.

Speaker 4:          00:14:37       Do you, uh, when you were doing the prison thing and you talked to the guy and you said you look at a combination of a child and a child molester.

Speaker 3:          00:14:44       Yeah, yeah. They're rare personal click a child, not a child molester at the same time. And he did, you know, it wasn't like Fidel. He did. Yeah. Nailed it there. I just say try to say out loud what people normally would say behind people's backs. Hence the karate self defense. I do remember early instances of hecklers before I knew anything about roasting. I was just a comedian, you know, usually emceeing, uh, you know, on the road or a jersey, you know, or you had a lot of characters and in the audience. And I remember a few times people taking swings at me or just walking on stage. I was working with rich vos at a firehouse. You know, I'd only been doing comedy a year or two and I opened for him at some sort of fundraiser to firehouse. And Ah, I was about five minutes into my routine Saturday night.

Speaker 3:          00:15:37       These firemen are in their firehouse. There's, this is, you know, this is before there were any rules to anything as far as you know, uh, and just, just, they kept telling me, make fun of Larry, make fun of Larry. He loves it. Make Fun of Larry and I don't know who Larry is and you know, of course Larry turned out to be the biggest asshole on the planet who doesn't love it at all. And he literally was gigantic and walked up on stage and took the microphone out of my hand, put it in the mic stand and said, you're done.

Speaker 3:          00:16:11       Wow. The audience laughing before that. I don't remember. I'm sure they weren't laughing enough. You know, I just remember it being so hard and it just builds up your, you have to have thick skin and you got to be able to like stare. You got to have confidence that you know, you're, you're in the right. Well, you definitely would get a little bit more confidence. Haven't gone through martial arts cause you've, you've done some difficult stuff. Been involved with a little bit of conflict. I mean I did karate tournament as a kid and it's like you never feel more alive than when you're competing. And I love when comedy has a little tension to, it doesn't have to be all about what I think. I sometimes I remember getting it as heckling became more and more pro in the audiences. You just more and more you heard people heckling and uh, there were famous instances of hecklers and audiences and stuff like that and I said, fuck it.

Speaker 3:          00:17:10       People are going to videotape to shows. It's so annoying. Why don't I just go one step further and put the audience on stage? Well, I, so that's when he started speed roasting, interactive. I wanted my show to be more interactive and I, I'm still partially like that, but I think the audience is a big part of the experience now. We'll also for you, because that's your, it's your style. Like, you know, maybe that wouldn't work for some guys, but you it just fits. Yeah. So you do it. Yeah. And I grew up at a catering hall. I like talking to people. I like knowing why they're at my show and [inaudible]. Yeah. My grandparents, my uncles, my cousins. Me. So you just always around people. Uh, food people.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       He dancer tons with stars. You were telling me that you got your, I fucked up and dance with the star. Had a scratched cornea on the last rehearsal on the first day of the live show and went to the hospital and danced. Anyway, it was just, I got the lowest scores since, since, I dunno know Larry Flynt wheelchair flipped over and season two. So you just couldn't see. Oh, you had an eye patch while you were doing. Wow. Do Lucky. You'll fucking look pretty thin there. Yeah. Well there's a lot of way doing that show. I lost about 20 pounds. Yeah. How much is your ego away the year he goes off five pounds for sloths. That too. But I look good. That's editor. She's awesome. Yeah. You. You have to practice every day for that shit. I practiced. I was in the best shape of my life.

Speaker 2:          00:18:39       Yeah, I did a all day. I did a dancing scene with Leslie Bibb in the movie zookeeper. We had to do this fucking crazy dancing scene, so we had to take dancing lessons. It's hard. It's fucking hard to do. And here's the thing, I don't like it. I love it. I didn't want to do it. Do you pull it out? The roast battle? We have a, no, I don't want to do already on the back bar. Really at the comedy store. Dance, dance, dance like 30 people to me. Why is it 150 degrees in here? Any reason? Maybe. Let's see if there was an ac things work. It's hot as fuck in here, isn't it? I do the whip. I'm sweating too. Then ne Ne. What does that, it's a new dance craze. Oh, whip and the DNA name. Do you know what it means? It means when you break your leg and you had a cast on and you take off the cast and it stinked like the stinky leg. So what it means. The kid had it here. All the kids are going crazy. You ever heard of stinky leg? What do you do? You not even on the mic and you're not making any sense. Go put the AC on and come back and we're formulate your thoughts while you're out there.

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       That's Brian two hits and that's what happens to hits and he forget. He just, he just doesn't make sense to anybody but him to him. It's totally making sense. It's just so fun. Thanks buddy. Nice studio. Glad to be on the show. It's comfortable, right? First Time. Finally Dude, I've been asking You keep saying no. Well you know, I'm just happy to be here. I'm happy to have you here man. I get to see you. We've been friends a long time. Long fucking time. Back before you were Jeff Ross. That's right. I knew you would do different numb diploma. Lift Schultz. Yes. Back Up. What made you change it to Ross? It's enough. Enough. Well, technically Ross. Well Ross is my middle name and I'm still Jeff. Flip shoulds, what I call your driver's license. Certain things, taxes and shit. And I was on star search. That's why I changed it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:29       And Ed Mcmahon kept mispronouncing my name. This is my first time on TV and I was so, it just threw me, I was so new, I didn't know he just couldn't handle, please welcome your challenge or Jeff Lifshitz and it's just come out from my three minutes, like all frazzled, trying to make my family proud. I'd never been on TV. So now their names wrong, you know? So, and then you also had to use a smaller font on the screen when they introduced me and it made me crazy. Jeff Lifschultz. It took up the whole, Oh right. So on the flight home, after I lost, I said I gotta do something and I just started using my middle name Ross named after my great grandmother Rose Lift Schultz, who was the greatest cater in New Jersey. And it all comes full circle. Well it's good too because it's the same letters, Jeff Ross, the same amount of letters, foreign for Bam.

Speaker 2:          00:21:17       And that only started in solid. Yeah, it feels good. Solid. I like it. Hey man, it works. And by the way, when I was bad, when I was a kid, they called me that anyway. Jeffrey Ross. Javier. Oh really? Yeah. Oh well that's perfect then. Yeah. What made you decide to do this thing in a prison? Because that was a fucking risky, ballsy move. You know, we talked about it and like Paul Rodriguez had a special that he did in the prison, but uh, quite honestly, he looked a little nervous. It's back in the day, it looks a little nervous. This was many years ago. He did a, an HBO special live from that prison critique that he looked nervous and a prison. Of course it's because you didn't look nervous. You watch carefully enough because I was fucking, I can hear myself stuttering and I can see my sub shaking.

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       And, but you were pretty remarkably relaxed for the fact that you were roasting prisoners. I mean, you were having fun with it, man. It was fun. And you even speed roasted them on stage. So you turned your back to these fucking guys. Like, did you know who they were or what they did? No. No idea. No, but I, I thought it would be disrespectful not to do it. Like a doing normal show, right? No, no. I didn't know a lot about them. I just tried to be in the moment and learn about them as I went along and I learned a lot. Well you wrote something, was it for huff post? Is that what you wrote it for? And I read it and then I retweeted it because it was, it was fucking really powerful man. And that's one of the things about their is I went to a Texas jail to Rosia inmates.

Speaker 2:          00:22:47       You here what I learned about incarceration in America and then in the corner is a girl arrest. Um, but it's also, it wasn't just that, it wasn't just this, this article too, but also the little pieces that you had a, in the videos where you had like the stats, like one out of every 100 Americans is in jail and there's more black men in jail right now than there were slaves in the 18 hundreds. Right. Fucking a man. It's an emergency. It's an embarrassment to America when you think about that, if that many people are in jail and you know it is one good piece of positive news I saw is that they're commuting some sentences of nonviolent drug offenders. You know, it'll only be in the hundreds, that 65 so far, which is done or what I saw the other day in one article at least.

Speaker 2:          00:23:38       Yeah. So maybe there's some hope that, I don't know. I do feel like the show, the roast helped people talk about it in a way that there's a little more accessible because it wasn't something I knew a lot about. And as I started writing, I really just wanted a roast criminals. I thought it'd be funny. And as I started writing the act, I did a stand up act for months in rehearsal in just to acclimate myself and then have an act that would kill in front of people that are locked up. Right now. I learned so much and that's what I think is the greater good for me is that not only that I make them laugh, but I got something out of it too. I mean, it's embarrassing that we have more people locked up in America than anywhere else in the world. And we're supposed to be a free country.

Speaker 2:          00:24:25       And the reasons why they're locked up, that's what's fucked up. And the also the idea that like someone in his world can't fuck up. You can't make a mistake. And if you do make a mistake, then you get locked in a cage. Especially a mistake if you're thinking about someone who's coming from a really poor background who needed money, took a chance and sold some drugs and that's it. And then you're locked in a cage. And that's, I'm sure a lot of the people that you were talking to, a lot of people that you were looking at, they were in there for some sort of nonviolent truck crime. It's a big percentage of our, our, our prison population. And when we were in the parking lot of the comic store, we had that, a conversation about it. It's, uh, it's pretty obvious that, I don't know if it changed it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:07       Could I say it changed you or it certainly affected you in a big way, man, you were, you were really taken aback by it. And just the sheer numbers and the experience itself. Everybody in there is a human being. You know, you look at those orange jumpsuits on the news or on lock up and people are just getting tossed around and pushed around. There's parts of jails. And even I didn't get to shoot in, you know, there's in the 70s hundreds of thousands of beds in mental hospitals just closed down. This is the way we run mental illness and America changed in the 70 so now the jails will become de facto mental hospitals and these jailers have to babysit people that are crazy. And that's not what the job is. And these places become very complicated to run and we just lock these people away. They come back over and over and over like human dust.

Speaker 2:          00:26:05       We forget about them. If you lock them, put them over there. We don't have to think about them, but the food sucks. Solitary confinement is barbaric. You know, we should just sort of be talking about that should be the biggest thing they talked about in that Republican. I hardly heard anything about prison reform. It seems to me like this is an emergency. It does seem like that. Did you hear they put Chelsea manning and solitary because her toothpaste was expired. They can do whatever they want. It's like, I wish I was making it up. Jamie. Pull it up. Why? What was the reason for that? Not supposed to have expired toothpaste? She wasn't brushing her teeth enough. It was just one of those things where they just, they

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       had a violation. They fucking hate this girl who used to be a guy. If you don't know the whole story, she is the former formerly artist, formerly known as, what was it written? The middle of the original name? Bradley Manning. Yeah, Bradley. And uh, he gave all the files to wikileaks and a look at this wikileaks source. Manning convicted over magazines and toothpaste. Well, what does it mean? What does the article say? They're convicted of violating the espionage act and prison for providing classified docket stop guilty on four charges to inmate tweeted. I'm receiving 21 days of restrictions and on recreation, no gym library or outdoors. Manning tweeted those four charges included medical issue, prohibited property, disorderly conduct and disrespect. Can't break the rules in medicine. Charge came after officials discovered expired tube of toothpaste in cell. That's the medicine charge. Wow. So they're just fucking weather contraband.

Speaker 4:          00:27:51       Karma came in the form of books and magazines. There's just a copy of Vanity Fair magazine featuring Caitlyn Jenner lol and a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine featuring an interview with manning. Oh Wow. She's not allowed to have an interview with herself, but according to Chelsea manning.org she received the reading material legally through the prison's open mail system. Yeah, they're fucking weather, dude. They're fucking weather. They can. They're fucking criminals. Just lock that person up and take away all, all the rights, all, all that's any privacy, the, any ownership they have over their own body or even what they want to read. Imagine that Vanity Fair's fucking contract band. You can get, you've locked up in solitary for a vanity fair, fuck sick. It's sick. And you know, look at that whole thing, the way it went down. That poor guy, um, uh, Julian Assange, he still locked up in that fucking, he's, he's still in that house, in the, uh, what do, what do you call those things?

Speaker 4:          00:28:54       Embassy. He's still in the Ecuador. Ecuador's embassy, something like that. Uh, in London, like you can't leave if he steps foot out of that building, he's fucked. So the dude's not getting any vitamin D, he's not going outside. Super unhealthy. It really is unhealthy. Like you really need to be outside poor fucker. You can't lose, you can't walk out the door. Yup. Exactly. But you know what they're saying? They're saying it. They, what they're saying is that it's a sex case that he had sex with a woman and then in the middle of the night, uh, he stuck it in again without a condom. It's called surprise sax. Like they were cuddled together naked and, uh, he didn't put a condom a second time. And I don't even know if the woman is pressing charges. I mean I don't, I don't know what's going on. But they were trying to extradite him for that like, right. Yeah. That's what you're doing. Yeah. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Like that's why this guy locked up in an embassy to manage. If every time a guy tried to cuddle with a chick and sneak it in without a rubber, that guy will get locked up in an embassy and behold up there there'd be the secretary of state. That'd be it. Every embassy in the world. You one of those surprise sex, enthusiastic. I love slipping it in it for $30 that's a, it's not in tactically rape because I guess she was asleep and they had already had sex and they were, you know, cuddled together and this little spooning type position, you know, Dick to Vijay Jay right from behind. I don't know. I'm just making it up cause I don't really know what happened. Nobody knows what happened. He says it's all bullshit. And, but the, the idea that they got this guy locked up for that and that's why they know it's not, it's Wiki leaks.

Speaker 2:          00:30:30       It's the fucking information they released. That's what they're trying to try to get them on a loophole. And we all know it. It's going on right in front of our eyes. It's fucking crazy. It's just right in front of our eyes that Ashley Madison finally got leaked, uh, yesterday. So whoever did that, I'm sure he's going to be the next one of these guys if they find out who it is. But that could just be a hacker though. And I could just be like the, the fat burning people, they just tap into kind of fucking mask, cock blocking that job. Ashley madison.com. So are getting laid there. Like fucking thumb, not getting laid. Nobody's getting laid. I should tick it's out. I saw it too. And it was scary as it. Not only does it have all the names, it has like all the information. So they, they leaked the credit card information.

Speaker 2:          00:31:17       They leaked everything. So did they lead who they had sex with or who they think that, yeah, cause you make an appointment with the other person. So like there's all, everything in there, an appointment, you're pretty much buying an escort, but it's not an escort. And so you're using your service. Did you hear about that Uber for escort APP that they have in Germany and they were like a Uber for escorts. It's like, it's, you know, it's like, like using Uber, except you have the escorts. You just fucking look at your phone. You say, Hey, I want to get my dick sucked when you put the thing up there and then really? Yeah. And then Uber, Debbie's on her way over, you know, Bluer. That was hilarious. When you call it the lesbian and the crowd for being looking like exactly like Justin Bieber.

Speaker 2:          00:32:02       It was perfect in the women's jail. Yeah. The women's jail was an interesting one, man, because they fucking laughed hard day, laughed harder, needed it. They did and they needed it in a whole nother way. Then the guys, what did it feel like? What is the difference tune? What does a woman's GL feel like as opposed to a male men's jail? Cause you don't feel it's like physically threatened, right? It's a little bit, a little bit right. I'm sure. I mean it was fine, you know, but I wasn't thinking about my own safety. I was more thinking about how to make this the most like at night my instincts were to make it like a nightclub. Treat the women as women, not as inmates. Right. And make

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       it the same way. I would add an comedy club and that's what I did. And they were shrieking with the light cause no one had spoke to them as women. They're always as yelled at in order to around and, and that came through that they really needed a laugh and to just be girls, women ladies for an hour and they wind up being so great. It was a warm up for me for the next night when I did two shows for the guys. Oh see do the ladies first. Yeah. And you said you had a real hard time trying to find prisons that would let you do this. Yeah. I W we reached out to 150 or so until finally we found one in Texas. That one, one. Wow. And whose decisions? The warden's decision. There's a few people who have to agree. Wayne Dickey as the jail administrator at Brazos county jail and he stepped up and had confidence in his institution, in his facility and he wanted her, he wanted everyone to see his staff and how great they were and to see how, uh, his inmate behavioral programs worked where he incentivizes the inmates.

Speaker 3:          00:33:51       How does that work in good behavior and they get rewards if you do your time without messing up. There are huge rewards on, one of them was coming to see me. These guys had to behave for one month in order to see my show. And then I took that as a huge compliment that so many people, uh, did that not everybody, but most of the jail, more than half came to my shows and they, they were appreciative and I felt that too. That's why the show came off because not only were they good sports, but they knew what they were signing up for ahead of time because they had a month to notice that I was coming there to roast them and I s there were posters around the jail and said, you know, if you can laugh at yourself, you're one step closer to freedom. And they came and when I asked for volunteers, guys were running down from the balcony.

Speaker 3:          00:34:43       They're not allowed to even be in the same room. It was a communal experience for the different sex and gangs and types of people, you know. It was all dudes and squeezed into this one room with the most dangerous, closer to the stage by the door and the least dangerous packed into the rafters. Wow. So if there was a problem, they could handle it. The jailers can handle it. It was very calculated. And as far as the safety of how it would go down, did you get your front kick ready? I was someone I was charging stayed in it, man. I was, I didn't want anybody near the stage. I wanted it to be the most like a comedy club, I can make it for them. So that was the only time that they were ever jammed into a room like that. Yeah. And you know that's a real security concern.

Speaker 3:          00:35:32       That takes quite a bit of planning to take five, six pods of dudes and put them in one room. They can overpower the jailers, they could over do whatever they want. There's cameras in there. I'm in there. So there was a huge trust factor. Wow. That went on between the jailers and the inmates, myself on my crew. So what kind of security that they have in place in case the shit hit the fan. I did ask about my security if I had any special person or a way out and they said absolutely not, which I couldn't believe at first. I think I took them off guard. They just didn't get to that. But their assumption was beyond me was there will not be any problems. So I am no more special than anyone else in that room be the way they set it up, which I respected. There was not going to be a problem. Where did you come up with this idea and what made you decide to film a special this way? Um, who, well, I wanted to make it purposeful. I wanted to learn something. I wanted to initially think of the funniest thing, which would be

Speaker 5:          00:36:41       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:36:41       Crime in America. And I talked to a lot of people. I'm friends with Tony Hinchcliffe, Mike Ferrucci, George Ryan Blatt, my cousin, Ed Larson. We just brainstormed and tried to think of the funniest, craziest Shit we could do. And somehow roasting criminals.

Speaker 5:          00:37:02       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:37:02       Seem like a hilarious way for me to do what I do face to face you, you know, roasting concepts as one thing or roasting people from behind a desk has all been done and, but go into it like getting into something, immersing in an environment. That's my specialty. I love that. To me it's like a corporate gig. You know, you're writing a special act for a certain night, then you're never going to do it again. Right, right. And I love that it's a roast. So that's what you like about roads. You like preparing for roasts? Like I've seen you at the S. Dot. The clubs, the Improv and the store getting ready pages and notes. Like you liked the whole event. Like there's an event coming up. I liked the writing. Yeah. The event is the is the payoff, but you have to enjoy the process. Say I like writing the jokes. So you just like a subject to focus on. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:38:01       I liked that. I something that I love that I'm interested in or curious about are a fan of, you know, it's gotta be something meaty, you know? I mean I can riff if I don't it, but if I'm invested in it somehow, like with the jail, I thought like, how did I like smoke so much pot and had so much fun in my life and never get in real trouble. I sold weed in high school. Like this could have been me. Yeah. You know, this could have been me. So I got curious and as I get personally curious and invested in something, I can start to see, find the hypocrisy that go into it. Hello. How

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       the humanity can be lifted out of it. And I started to see that this is a sad place and it's kind of like doing a Uso tour. And I told that to the jailers when I met with them. I had to go down there and ask permission a couple times and they had to trust me. You know that I wasn't there to humiliate anybody or expose anything that was not just, I don't know, I wasn't, I didn't have an agenda. What it's going to make it real. I was really just going to go there and see what, see if people had a sense of humor. It was simple. And as I got into it, I realize how lucky I am that I never got in real trouble, that I never got busted for anything. And then if I had, I'm not sure I would've survived.

Speaker 4:          00:39:19       Well, especially if you were selling pot, right? If you were selling pot, you could have got caught and you also go to, got talked into selling more pot. We've ever heard of those stories, like DEA agents go undercover and they'll talk a kid into a glisten. I'm going to put a deal together. You know, if you're a part of this, there was a story that they did in rolling stone about a DEA undercover agent who talked this kid into a big cocaine deal that wasn't real. It wasn't real. There was no real cocaine, but he talked this kid into selling it and this kid is in jail for life now. Kid was just a low level dealer. He was selling, you know, a little bit here, a little bit there and nothing big. And this DEA guy essentially talked to him into doing some gigantic deal that put them in jail for 25 to life.

Speaker 4:          00:40:03       And that can happen to anybody. You can. I look, I've made some big fuck ups in my life. I've been an idiot many times in my life. I've, I've, you know, there's no, I don't know, a single person who hasn't made mistakes. We all make mistakes. It's, but it's whatever the environment is that you're growing up in dictate how bad your situation is, whatever, you know, whatever you were exposed to. And that might be a factor in the level of your mistake. So the dumb mistakes that I made with a pretty uneventful childhood. Nothing too serious. Good parents, nice folks. My mom's a sweet person, you know, love my sister. It's like pretty easy life growing up in Newton, Massachusetts. Not Hard, not hard at all. I imagine just a much more chaotic situation with the same person living in Inglewood, you know, whatever. Watts, Detroit in some fucking hopeless place where you can't get out.

Speaker 4:          00:40:59       And then next thing you know, you're in fucking jail. You're in jail and you're going to be in jail for five, six years. And during that time you go from being 21 to 26 and now you getting out and you're fucking, you're a man and you're a convict. You can't get a fucking job. And you're just trying to figure out how scratch and survive. It's fucked. It's fucked. You know, it's fucked that there's so many people out there that just don't get a chance or whatever chance to get, you know, and it's, a lot of people go off, you just follow the law, but to get the fuck outta here, that's nonsense. Especially when it comes to selling drugs just doesn't make sense. It doesn't make any sense of these kids just doesn't.

Speaker 2:          00:41:36       And then I saw guys 18 1920 years old, been already been in one, two, three times

Speaker 4:          00:41:44       and imagine what their parents are like imagining what their neighborhood was like. Imagine what their uncle was like, whatever the fuck they encountered from the time they were a baby until the time they're a prisoner. And then the fucked up thing is you just become kind of a human battery because all you do is you generate money for private prisons. Every one person that goes into those private prisons is worth a certain amount of money for those companies and they sell that. That's what their, that's their business. Their business is making money, extracting money at a prisoners and there's a whole system that's involved in doing it all the way from the guards, the guard unions make sure that they keep certain drugs illegal and make sure that certain laws stay on the books and certain penalties are still in place. It's fucked, man. It's fucked. You know, I had this guy on the other day we were talking about and he was saying that one of the only things that keeps it from getting even worse is that the private prisons and the the guard unions don't get along like the, the guards want certain things at the prisons don't because the prisons don't want to pay the guards. So there's the fucking, there's a little internal struck, but if they work together it would be even worse. Terrible. You could have been a prisoner. You could have totally fucked up. Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:42:53       I was in prison or jail at I. That's where I learned what hooch was. Well, you went to jail for something you didn't even do. You got, you got, you are at all the dudes I've ever met and of all the guys that I've ever met who have run across crazy women that get really fucking angry at you when you break up every fucking girl you've ever

Speaker 4:          00:43:12       dated since I've been friends with you, they get furious at you when it's over. Where they want to kill you. Yeah, I've seen it in person. I just not, it's not just granted you inspire that in some men as well.

Speaker 2:          00:43:26       I just date those crazy bitches. I don't know what I really, uh, I think I mentioned whatever attract my attraction. My smell that I like on women is ones that are more entertaining than boring, I guess. Well, you liked those dirty girls to a lot of times, dirty girls that are involved in naked things. No, those girls wilder, they're more fun. You know, I was thinking like, I want to meet a girl that, that every time she goes to Vegas to hang out with her friends like that, she sends me a photo of that. I'm not looking at the wallpaper and then comparing it to like Dan Blitzer in Instagram photos, you know, like I'm like, wait a second, it looks like the same cup on his nightstand damn bills area, whatever. I just found out about that guy. Like I, I'm like the last person I just went to his Instagram and she's like, wait, this is what everyone's been talking about. That's amazing that he's made millions of dollars playing poker. Apparently more than a hundred million dollars playing poker, but he got all his money from his dad to his dad was a some famous character, so he's like been rich. His life doesn't

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       give a fuck. Hey, it looks like here's a lot of fun. What Jamie? Where's those as well? I would lytros we'd give you some of those night crump. Nitros nitros no, nitro coffee. Caveman coffee. Those nitrogen native brewed cold brewed coffees. I'm addicted to those little things right now. They're awesome. You ever have one? Do you drink coffee? Sure. Get one for Mr. Ross. Mr. Ross would like a night. What? Cause be drinking? Fuck fucking Jamie. He drank all of them. I had three of those. You fucking savage. Give him the real one and get me a uh, a bottle of water. No, no, no. It's okay. That other stuff. Same Shit. Just fucking around. He does drag him everyday. Those savage, you got to order something, Jamie, if you're going to drink them every day. You got to order. I'm okay fucking animal. Thank you sir. Do we have any cold water's in there. What did you think about the whole fat Jewish thing? Yeah, that's what we're talking about actually. Before the show, um, you were saying that you think that the networks need to loosen up on the Internet needs to tighten up. What'd you mean by that?

Speaker 3:          00:45:37       Oh, I was just saying, I was just talking off the cuff, but thanks buddy. You know, we're talking about this guy who goes by the fat Jewish on Instagram and I would follow him in. I'd see funny stuff on there. So I kind of knew about him. I didn't know a lot about how he collected his material. I guess I didn't think about it. Like most of the 5 million people who follow him, they don't care. They just want to laugh. They're not thinking about anything, you know? And then I started to see that he was collecting whatever he thought was funny. I'm not sure, I don't know a lot about it, but

Speaker 4:          00:46:15       he makes me robbing people's names out. He wasn't just collecting things. He was actively trying to make sure that he didn't show who created it and he just put it on his page. So he didn't give credit to the people that made it. That's what the big problem was. Everybody read tweets, things you retweet things. I read someone, one of our friends said something funny. It helps them when you retweet it and it shows first of all entertains that people that get to read it on your Twitter feed and it gives that person to credit. It's a great thing. There's nothing wrong with re tweeting. I think if he did that, he would have the same amount of people. If he really was a true aggregator, like huffpost, they credit everybody that they use. Yeah. So what I'm saying is this is an aggregate, the Internet my entire career, like

Speaker 3:          00:46:56       I've never made money off all the millions of clips that are out there. Right. You know, millions of views and people are always shooting comedians. Comedians get annoyed, you know our material. You know, you see a lot of comedians when it's shut down, phones at their shows because they don't want their half written jokes on the internet or they don't want their fans to see their material without having to pay for it either. Live at a show or buying their specials online. So I go, it seems MTV seems restricted all the time. So maybe what do mean by TV's restricts it

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       all the time?

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       Well, you know, you have in the networks are trying to be edgier, but there's still bleeps and they're still censorship and there's all sorts of regulations. But with the Internet, everyone always explained it was a wild, wild west, you know, and you can just do whatever you want, like all the time you'll see people will make videos and comprehends and they'll edit famous movies and you just use whatever footage and no one ever cares. Then now people are starting to care a little bit. They're looking for ways the last five, 10 years to monetize the Internet. And to me it's coming very close to being how we watch everything. I hardly ever watch TV anymore and when I do, it's a big live event. In the end they're just all starting to become does. No more of the Internet. There's no more TV, it's just programming and it's different brands and you go to those brands. So I go at some point, the regulations for the Internet and television should be the same and they should be, they should get together and it should just be, do you mean it's once a set of standards for now on,

Speaker 4:          00:48:33       but what do you mean by standards? Do you mean as far as

Speaker 3:          00:48:36       for, as far as, um, the music rights and how it all goes down and the stuff we have to, you know, the residuals and those sorts of things and how the unions operate on the Internet as the actors and directors and writers unions, you know, the fees and the rules for the internet or, or different payment minimums are different from the Internet and television. Right now I'm in the writer's guild and I dunno, I mean it's all the same now at this point. And I feel like the Internet needs to step it up and they should be crediting stuff and

Speaker 4:          00:49:08       paying for rights. And to some extent I think it's happening. And I think that's good. I think you're right. I think the, for a long time it was innocent. You know, like someone would post a funny meme right on their Instagram and no one cared because it was just, just people being funny like, God, this is, this guy's funny. But then when people started making a lot of money off of it and then you realize, well what made that guy famous? Well he's just an aggregator. All he's doing is collecting all the shit that's online and instead of the row, the actual writers of each one of those individual bits getting some credit, all the is going to him. So now what he's doing with this guy who calls himself the fat Jewish is doing is he just puts the guy's name at the end or the girl's name at the end.

Speaker 4:          00:49:52       So he steals her picture, puts it up on his site. And instead of saying, this picture was made by Jeff Ross, the real Jeff Ross, it now just has an un [inaudible], just a tag, you know at. And then whoever's name it is with no mention of where you know that this person created this originally, it just, they just throw their name up there, which is stupid. Like, all you have to do is this hilarious meme was created by boom and then that person gets credit. That person probably happy, they'll get a shit load of fucking, people will come to visit them and sign up and follows. He's not doing that.

Speaker 2:          00:50:26       And I did notice he sorta does it at the end of whatever the new comment is. So it almost looks like the person who wants to give credit to, he's actually giving credit for the comment. Not In some ways. In some ways, yeah. It's just not, it's not an open, you know, it's just like, it's, it's reluctant. It's a reluctant credit at the end. What else is he funny? I haven't seen, I don't know. I mean, he's a good marketer, obviously. He's really smart at putting it all together. He's eating, he's not, by the way, he's not even giving proper credit on a lot of them. I've noticed like he's, uh, he's, he's saying that accounts, like he's saying that that person made this, but then you go to their account and they don't have that on their Instagram. There's a few instances where he's crediting these people that didn't make it, aren't even active.

Speaker 2:          00:51:16       Like one of the people ha even used their Instagram for like 12 months and it was just like if you went go through all his photos, it has nothing to do with what he like, why he credited. So it's weird why thing he's doing that. Um, what the Internet is saying. Uh, allegedly I gotta protect myself. I talked to my lawyer yesterday about all these. Really? Yeah. Why? Uh, just cause I don't want to get s get in trouble or anything like that. You know, we need to have somebody that's Jewish and the first thing you think of that you're going to get sued. If you could talk about how's that? She'll tell you, sit next to this guy. Kidding. But Damn, man, I German, you know. No, no Irish. Brian was Shelly. No, you wrote on your page this fat German I know is going after this fat Jew. Yeah. Uh, but now what was I talking about?

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       You tell me. What was I talking about? Who Cares? Yeah. You were talking about him not giving credit to Internet is saying is that he's, uh, that he has a lot of these interns supposedly that are half the accounts, uh, that he, uh, credits. So he has his intern take it from somebody else and put it on, on his account, and then he credits his intern so that it's still in the family. Like he's not gay. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's kind of like a loophole that's a big, allegedly you don't have any, well this is just what the Internet, Internet, which forum? There's Reddit, Reddit, Reddit, a forum. I, there's, yeah, I think both of them are on reddit and there's another website that's doing it also, but if you just Google him, uh, there's a lot of message boards that have been talking about him for years, uh, and breaking down everything. He's stolen and, and, and, and it's, um, it's, it's very interesting. Did he call himself a curator or something on this Instagram pages? Me Sort of saying this is what I do. Is that what he's saying? I Dunno. I Dunno. Um, we should say though, because somebody posted this yesterday that, um, you know, we were talking about that girl, she's really funny. Um, that, uh, we were saying, what was her name again? Pistol. Sherman. Yeah. Um, people so that she has, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       uh, misappropriated people's stuff as well. I don't know how that works. So yeah, I don't know if it's true or not. I think she is a, I think she's kind of admitting that she has definitely put some stuff up that somebody sent her that she thought was funny, but I think she said 80% of this stuff is hers. But you know what I mean? A lot of people, they're just finding memes that are funny and they put them on their page. It's kind of innocent in some ways. Right. That's what I mean, the Internet, I don't know. It's for amateurs or something. Still we've got to figure out how to make it, but how do you, I mean, jet Brian Rather did a great job of actually finding the, the original image and finding the time. The original image was posted in the day and that's how he credited people. And that's how he actually discredited a couple of people that originally were trying to claim that they came up with it first. But it was proven that somebody else had it posted the exact same image to the exact same tax before them.

Speaker 6:          00:54:22       Yeah, it's kind of sucks cause if we want reg regulations, if we want to make change how it is now, what it's going to happen is it's like when you have a youtube video and it detects that there's copyright and material in it. So now anytime we want to post like a photo on our Facebook or, or tweet something, we're going to have like a block and we kind of don't want that.

Speaker 4:          00:54:43       You can't fuck with the Internet, man. They find you. They find you. When you, when you tried to sell them a plate of bullshit, people find you. They just figure it out. You can't get away with it. You just can't do you see the aspree thing [inaudible] look at this. Dave Asprey put up a photo of his stomach of a fake, a fake photo of stock photo of someone else's abs shredded and said, you know, this is my stomach after a 4,500 calories a day and no working out and it's just a stock photo. It's a stock photo and he's trying to say that his bulletproof diet gives you that. In his defense, if you click on the link, there's an actual photo of his actual abs that Jamie, thanks a photo shopped allegedly Jamie, thanks for allegedly Photoshop. You don't even need to say it. Let's not even pull it up, but it's the same thing.

Speaker 4:          00:55:34       It's the same thing. You can't fuck with these people if you're, if you're blatantly bullshitting and stealing, they cannot find you. That's the, that's really funny though. Like, like I said, he did that, like I put working out and just post like that guy has muscles everywhere. If you, if there was really a way that you can get a body like that guy's without ever working out, you would have to be some sort of a genetic manipulation. You have to be some experiment. That's, that's not just apps. That guy has chest muscle, shoulder muscles. It's a guy that trains probably on our daily basis. The fact that he would put that picture up. It's just so crazy. It's funny. He's so crazy. Just so it's so fucking nuts. People were out of their goddamn minds. They really are. And the Internet, it's, you know, it's kind of fucking expose. That shit just takes a matter of time. You got to go see shows. Live

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       standup you mean? Yeah, the less jokes on the internet than I used to. I put less jokes on Twitter than I used to because I want my best material for when you come see me live and that's much more unique and exciting experience. People get mad sometimes if you talk about something on the podcast, even if you bring up the subject and then have a bit about it on stage. Oh, you were talking about doing on the pond curves like do you not want us to talk about funny shit on the pod passed? Can you, can you allow us to come up with ideas spontaneously on the podcast and then talk about them on stage as well? You fucked. Yeah, I've done that before.

Speaker 2:          00:57:02       That's just, you know, they want to know that. Well, they just want to fucking let you know that they're listening to the Rudy. Don't you think though that it's good though, that they keep you on your toes? I think even with the hyper criticism like each, you don't want to dive into it. Like you don't want to just do a Google search on your name final. All the people talking shit about you. It's not good. But knowing that they're there probably gives you an edge. It gives you, keeps you sharp. I can see that. I think so. Keeps you sharp. I try not to read the bad comments. I try to stay away from the haters and stay positive. Well, you try hard though. When you work hard at what you do, it's not like you're slacking off and someone's coming along and calling you on it.

Speaker 2:          00:57:42       If they're saying something mean shit, they just don't like you. They might not like your style. There's going to be people that like you know him or like anybody, you know, they like a certain style and they don't like your style or they do like your style. You don't like somebody else's style. They're not right or wrong. They just have their own taste. No, they're wrong. Everyone likes my style. Would you read it though? Some of them are so fucking mean. And why is that? Just because they want you to notice them. They want to make it a lot of people sometimes. Yeah, they're outlet. Just rude and mean. It's mine. Why would it, what am I argue with them? I don't. I ignore them. I don't want him to block him. No, because then they know you saw it. Well cares. Why do you care if they know? I don't want them to put that. Just want them to float in the sea and not do. But you did see it. Yes. So why acknowledged some piece of shit then he can just keep doing it. You're going to get Twitter bomb now. They gonna bomb you real Jeffrey Ross, bring it on.

Speaker 2:          00:58:38       I'm ready. What are you going to tell me? I don't know. Already. Fucking know, you know, fucker. What are you going to tell me? Real Jeffrey Ross Christ are so aggressive. Come on, bring it on. You think? I don't know. I look like Bruce Willis drowned. Bring it on mother fuckers. I'm ready for some. Bruce was wishy looked like you write down on my Twitter right now. Bruce Willis looks like shit. He wishes to execute now. Poor bastard. I just spent a week at the beach. This is his tan as I'm ever gonna to look good. I feel very healthy. You look vibrant. Thank you. We're gonna say I've, uh, I've toned it down more on Twitter than I used to. Like making fun of people or like attacking people. You know, on Twitter, I used to be, I think, you know, back

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       in the early days of your message board and stuff, we used to have like kind of fun, like having online battles with people. You know, Moore's Florence flame wars, that's what we used to call it. We so called flame wars. Yeah, those were fun. They were fun. But too many people jump in. Now there's the other thing is it's not just two people going back and forth. It's a bunch of people that would decide that they're on the other guy side or this guy side and jump in. Like you get a lot of that now. There's a lot of what you see online when there's any sort of a debate about something as pylons, you know, there's a bunch of people pile on one side or the other. You know, I tweeted something the other day and this guy's a, he's up for, he might go to jail in Canada because he's been tweeting at this girl and apparently there was like some agreement that he wouldn't tweet at her anymore, but he used to, he used to be on her side.

Speaker 4:          01:00:09       I think he actually even did some artwork with her, but she's like this radical feminist and you know, and she took them to court. Like she, she called the police on him. This guy was harassing her like she, it was even sometimes she would write something about him and the fact that he responded to her about him, she was saying he was harassing her, which is kind of hilarious. But all I did was there was an article and a video and uh, I retweeted it cause I was like, oh, this is interesting. The exact title of the video is what came up on my tweet in the exact same order because I just went to the youtube thing where it says share. And I tweeted it. I didn't put any commentary, I didn't have any editorial control over it. And so many fucking people were angry at me saying that I'm a misogynist and why would I post this?

Speaker 4:          01:00:55       And like it's a woman in the video, an older woman in the video is talking about this case. So it's a woman's video about a woman who's suing a man and the man might go to jail because the man was tweeting at a woman who didn't want him to tweet at her. This is like, this is crazy. But I looked at the comments, I was like, Jesus Christ. Like the fucking mean. People piling on an angry at me that I tweeted this. I guess you could kind of think that maybe this is my opinion instead of me just sharing something, but I share shit. I don't believe in at all. I share it. I'll share some flat earth shit or some big foot shit or any I share nonsense. I'll, I'll retweet people that think the earth is less than 10,000 years old. I do that all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:01:37       This is one dummy that I fall. I retweet them while I'm, I don't retweet them anymore because I don't want them to know that I follow. I do. I do read his shit. It's just so ridiculous. Some of his stuff is soak. It's all anti. Oh, it's either he hates Obama. I wish I remembered his name. Joe Summon up something starts with C, but he's like one of the dumbest religious guys online and everything is like either anti-Obama or anti evolution or anti, uh, the earth is, you know, four point whatever they think it is. 4.6 billion years old. He's convinced it's less than 10,000 years old and he's a real guy. It's not, it's not, it's not a parody account. There's this MTV celebrity, I don't want to say who she is, but she's always

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       on TMZ and it's always her being like, like, don't you know who I am and getting arrested and like, like she's just like this like, like privileged white girl celebrity from MTV. And I, I tweeted her something cause he was a recently she hit a cop or something like that and she's just that they're drunk and they're just recording her outside of a club handcuffed. And I tweeted or something and it got a lot of retweets and last night I was at the thing and she was there staring me down. I'm like, this is it. I can't do this. She's going to attack me right now. And I was, that's one of those things that are like, I wish I never tweeted that. Cause now she knows like as an enemy. Yeah, she's an enemy for no reason. Like it was just me. Like, dude, I should have said that. You know, to myself instead. Right. Tweeting it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:03:06       You that you could definitely create little enemies, you know, by tweeting something that you think is going to be funny again to get a big rise. Right. And then, you know, you realize, especially if you get high, right, you get really high and you go, why am I doing this? I'm creating enemies. What am I doing? Joe's, wait, I was put it in my notebook and wait till the morning. That's a good move. But sometimes you gotta be on the ball. You've got to be the first one to attack. Yeah. Those days are over. Who Cares? I took two hits today. I went to yoga and it was breaking down my whole life in that yoga class. Oh my God. The things chat about things I don't get upset about. Just I need to be nicer. Just calm the fuck down too. Worked up. I get to, I think I'm doing too many things in my life.

Speaker 4:          01:03:49       I really think that that's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking I'm under too much pressure and stress and even though I'm cool about most things, like there's certain times where I have a perfect reaction to something. Like I always bring up this time, whether the guy hit me, uh, on the highway and my, uh, my car fucking texting rear ended me smashed into me. But I had gone to yoga that day just from uncle, a little rainfall felt great. I was loved, I loved the world. I got out, I was fine. I did, I wasn't hurt and I wasn't even mad at the guy went over to him, I go, you okay? And he's like, I'm sorry. You know, I fucked up. I go, it's okay. We all fuck up. And then I go, do you have a license? Cause I don't have a license. He didn't have a license, he was illegal.

Speaker 4:          01:04:30       He's from May call. And I thought about it, I said, all right, I'm outta here. And I just bailed. And I said, I'm not, I don't want to call the cops cause I don't want them to go to jail because look, his car's fucked. His car was fucked. Anyway, his car was totaled. He had a civic and he, uh, he, you know how sometimes you hit the brakes, your car goes down, like you go under the car. So his car went kind of under my car, lifted my car up and sent my car flying. So my car, what did not have that much damage? It was only a beam that needed to be replaced in the back bumper area, but which was all plastic. So they just put a new piece of plastic and they replaced the beam and it was good to go. I had it back in a couple of weeks, but, uh, I've thought about this total and you would've ruined his life.

Speaker 4:          01:05:10       And he told the cop, no, I would have had to, they would have had a tow me, so they would have known. But I thought about, and I was like, this guy, you know this guys, he's got a shit. Roll the dice. He got to shit, roll the dice. He made a mistake. I'm not hurt like I'm okay and I can pay for this. I can figure it out. Like, I'm going to just get the fuck out of here. I just said I'm just gonna go. All right man. Nice to meet Ya. Took a picture of his fake license. Yeah, just in case some weird shit happened and he said I did something and you know, you never know and just get out of there. Apparently he has insurance. I might be, I might actually get paid for this, but the point being that the way I reacted to it, I wish I could react to it like that all the time, but I don't know if I would like, if I'm stressed out, I got a bunch of shit going on and there's blood fucking, you hit this boiling point where you come in on a four or five instead of at a zero.

Speaker 4:          01:06:03       He coming in hot already, you know? And I was thinking about that while I'm a in Yoga class. I was like, there's times where I'm, my reaction to the thing is not entirely warranted by the situation itself, but it's more dealing with all the different shit that I've got going on in my life. It's too many. I have too many things. This is what I think.

Speaker 3:          01:06:23       Okay, this might be crazy, but I think this is part of the problems with police brutality and some of the mistakes of cops have made is they come in hot, their job is tough and other stuff's going on and then you'd come from one thing to another and they warrant different roles and disciplines and, and danger levels. But they coming in not knowing or, you know, fired up their blood pressure. I've talked to cops, especially in New York and Chicago where they're on blood pressure medication and their families are stressed out and um, their, their, their job is more intense than it ever has been.

Speaker 4:          01:07:07       Oh, it's an incredibly intense job. I couldn't even imagine it. I mean, do you know cops? Do you have any friends that are cops?

Speaker 3:          01:07:14       I'm getting to know more and more cops. I've known cops all my life. My karate teacher was a cop,

Speaker 4:          01:07:19       so is mine. My original cried teacher was Joe Esposito, Newton, Massachusetts, Kelly, Newark, New Jersey. A lot of cops learn karate. Italian cops. Exactly right. Isn't that a, it's just, it's, I just think that the job of doing a cop doing police work is probably not only is it not for everybody, probably too easy to get, it's probably too easy to be a cop. Like some people, they don't have the right mentality for it. I want a roast cups from my next comedy. That was a great idea. That's a great idea. It's not easy. Oh really? I think la would let you, yeah. Burbank, Burbank. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:08:02       tell the story, but maybe, I don't know. I might do it, but I might do a bunch of precincts. Yeah. Coming in hot, so I figured that out in Yoga class. I just figured out I need to do yoga more. I'm going to do something every day before I go out and face the world every day. Blow offs and stress. I spent some time and at the beach lately and that can also help, but that's, yeah. Why do you think people at the water or so mellow Paul Beach Communities and mellow? It's just so relaxing, man. It, it's also humbling. Did a week at the Jersey shore and a few days a Malibu and it just, we had some shit fixed and our kitchen and uh, so I rented a house for a while in Malibu. I would never, I would never buy it. I don't think I'd buy a house like on the water.

Speaker 4:          01:08:49       I think it's fucking crazy that waves come in. You never know when again, come in. Yes, we went out. I went out at night by myself down to the water. It was scary, dark, scary. I felt like you're having a trust with the ocean at any minute. It knows they could just swallow you up, but instead just creeps up to your feet and just says hi. Well I was Pam at any second steamrolled highways that had two floors and one four was above the water looking down. But the first floor was like the water would go right under the fucking bedroom. Like you would see the waves come in and you would hear them crash underneath you. And it was dark. And I'm looking out this window and I was high as fuck and I was looking out this window. It's like, oh my God, this is crack.

Speaker 4:          01:09:36       Can't sleep here. I was like, this is nuts and I know that this fucking building's been here for who knows, 10 years, whatever. I don't know that a lot of the house has been there since the 50s his pictures this like there's a one of those restaurants down there that has these old black and white pictures on the wall, but when you, when you're there at night, it looks like a monster and the day it's like this beautiful friend in the day. You look out there like I'd have breakfast and I'd sit down this little table, look out the window and eat eggs. I'm like, God, this is amazing. Look how beautiful it is just to be like next to this alien world, this beautiful alien world, and I'd see sea lions or seals or whatever the fuck they are and birds. Occasionally you'd see a fish splash around, but like this is so beautiful, but at nighttime, goddamn terrifying, but it's humbling.

Speaker 4:          01:10:23       I think that's one of the reasons why people that live in beach community is so nice because you just look out and just smacks you in the face with you. Ain't shit is so like that. I was thinking you get as holding a glass of sparkling water like Perrier or something out on the beach by myself and I was half done with it and I just tossed it down into the ocean. You just think that's, it's such a great equalizer is fancy cup of Perrier thinks it's so fucking important and high and mighty. You just drop it into an ocean. It's nothing, just nothing. It makes no impact. Nothing. All beach communities are filled with mellow people. Right? Pretty much. Never heard of an aggressive beach community, Long Beach. Nah, that's like snoop Dogg's, naval architects, builders, contractors

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       could spend 10 years building a skyscraper and most beautiful people will never stare at it. And the way they stare at the ocean, which is in the air, floating, splashing. Well, it just gives you this feeling of like this. It's a totally different world in front of you. Alright, Jersey shore it. No one's cool there, right? Like that's not even paying attention. The water, they're just doing steroids and fucking fist pump. What happened to that? How come that show went away? I don't know which ever bring it up under the car. Hurricane Sandy. That's what did it. Oh yeah, that's right. Did it? No. Yeah. That beech is fucked. No, people just got tired. They just got some back. I was just down at the Jersey shore. A lot of construction happening, lot of activity, a lot of people out having fun at the boardwalk, so it was, it was great.

Speaker 2:          01:12:01       I can't wait to go back. I used to do gigs out there. I used to do gigs for Bob Gonzo stationed down there. I don't even do it. I didn't get on stage once. It was, the beaches are beautiful and the weather was perfect. The water was just as warm as it is here. Don't people have a bad opinion of the Jersey shore though? Don't they? Think of it as you go there. It's just a bunch of Orange Guido's. Yeah. Fucking shit out of each other. It's not like that. Maybe. Maybe. It's evolved or maybe that was just a show showed it in a bad light, but it was great. There's that showed this old house, they just did it. They did a long special about rebuilding the Jersey shore and it's really interesting. I didn't I, that's what I thought also is just like this, like myrtle beach spring break thing the whole time.

Speaker 2:          01:12:41       He didn't know. It's very beautiful there. While my uncle lives there, my uncle lives on Jersey shore. He just sent me a some drift. What? He's an artist. Some shit like the Hamptons or any fancy beautiful beach. It's back. It's done sending them back. It doesn't already have a place down there. I was there last week. I sent the picture you guys together and he has a beautiful a house right on a lake. I mean he has to dream. He has a late, you walk into Artie Lang's house and the Jersey shore and if he didn't tell me he lived there, I would think like Mary Lou Henner live there is something, it's immaculately decorated, perfect nautical theme, the white pillows everywhere. There's no chance. And he's like, yeah, my sister's a designer. She did everything. So does he stay there all the time or sometimes I think he's there most of the time and he has his whole man cave with all this Thurman Munson themed memorabilia and he's just the best. And he's got a place in Manhattan too. Is that how he does? I think he lives a place in Jersey. Hoboken, right near Manhattan. Oh that's right. Yeah. Already can't leave New Jersey. That's hilarious. No, literally has like a bracelet on his ankle.

Speaker 2:          01:13:50       He got, he got visibly upset when I told them that I don't follow sports. Like you could see, he was like, like I was less of a man in his eyes. Really? Yeah. Yeah, I could see it. There's guys that are fucking crazy sports fanatics. We tell him, you don't give a shit about sports. The only thing that saved me is I'm actually a sports commentator, so I'm Kinda, I kinda, you know, I fall into the

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       Hippie, hipster, whatever category that he would hate the most. But it was, he was disappointed in me as a man. Really? That's strange. But I guess he does love sports, man loves it. Well, yeah, that's ports show that he was doing for a while with Nick Depaulo. I'm getting more into it. Sports, doing a fantasy football app. Get the fuck out. Draft an APP comes out in a few weeks. Really producing an APP. I'm like the voice spokesman of it. Look at you funny videos. That's a good idea. Play fantasy football and talk shit. Or your friends. Do you know football? Do you understand it? Of course. I played high school football. Yeah. What's that guy's name with a giant arms. Jamie know that Popeye. What's his name? Ron Land. Do you know? He is a picture. Do you know who he is? I think Ron Landry. You obviously don't know like Jamie knows it.

Speaker 4:          01:15:01       Maybe you need a man like Jamie on your team. Yeah. Oh yeah. He's not. This fucker knows a lot. Look at this guy's arms. He showed me this yesterday. Get the fuck out of here. What is that? He said the dude's been busted a few times for steroids. I said, no way. He's obviously had no shirt on over that thing. He just does it. Shirt scared shirt just goes over. Okay. Okay man. Jesus Christ. Scroll, Scroll up. What does that one with him holding the camera up? He's got the phone up to the far right. What the fuck is that? Jesus Christ. That is an enormous human being. Didn't even make people like that a hundred years ago, but he's a safety too. So those guys are tended to be a little smaller than like a linebacker alignment. How much does that guy way about how tall is he rather? Uh, I'll find the stats, but yeah, find a stats if, but if he, it depends on, I mean he could be like five, seven and he'd still be 230 pounds. Wow. Built like that. He's a fucking giant. He's beautiful. You like it? Six feet tall. Two 20. It's just an ape filled with fucking testosterone and fury. God Damn, that's an athlete. That's about as strong an athlete as you get human bins there. He like, you know, great slave auction are back in the day.

Speaker 4:          01:16:20       Look at them that way. But we're all apes. I'm an eight year an ape waves. It's what humans are just saying. The way you break down a person's physical appearance. That's what I do. I'm an, I'm a sports commentator. If you remember full stick testosterone, that guy's a fucking dat is a silver back. That's a silver back gorilla. Yams on that guy. I mean you'd never had a human being that was built like that a hundred years ago. This is an entirely new era of humanity. Like you look at those Greek statues, those were exaggerated and that was the best they could imagine in their head. Those guys are pussies. Every one of those key Greek guys was good. It looks like they barely work out. You know like the, the, the biggest stud Greek statue. Like how's it compare to this guy? Not even close. Yeah. Show me a Greek statue.

Speaker 4:          01:17:08       Show me like the best Greek statue with the most muscular of all the, the Romans or the Greeks. Shit. Some fucking animal. I want to see what it looks like cause I guarantee it didn't look nothing like that dude. They just didn't even know the people are capable smuggling these. Wow. That's actually a pretty big, that guy's pretty yoked. He's pretty studly except for his little cock. I wonder if people really did have little dicks back then or if they just made them have little dick so that everybody looking at the sculptures didn't feel bad because like look at that guy's dead. That's an enormous man with a fat guy's Dick. That is what like a mushroom cap and the guy looks huge. It looks like the hulk. I take back everything I said. I take back everything I said though. Cause that guy's giant. Look at them. Does that real? The guys back? Is that real? Come on. Yeah, they were really fit, man. That's real from a computer. That doesn't seem real to me. For some reason that we're looking at this guy's back that is insanely muscular and it's a sculpture, but his ass cheeks are a little too big and he's holding something in his hands or you get to play your Nick Jonas Gilfoyle rent. Come on, look at the muscles on that guy's back. He looks like Vandelay Silva when he was fighting in pride.

Speaker 4:          01:18:26       Yeah. See that guy. That guy's a pussy. Okay. It looks like a big condos. Yeah. It looks like you've never done a squat in his life. None of these guys who make the NFL. No, no fucking way. Not with the athletes they have today. I think we all agree that the NFL athletes are the most impressive athletes in all sports. Right? Can we agree on that? As far as like horsepower about what they can do, the speed coordination, right. W we all agree and I, you know, obviously I work for the UFC. I think UFC athletes are incredibly impressive, but as far as like what they have to be able to do, UFC athlete has to be able to fight. If it's championship fight, you have to be able to fight five rounds, five minutes each round. You just can't do that. If you're built like an NFL player and you just can't, you can't do it.

Speaker 4:          01:19:12       It's not possible. So that is a bodybuilder though. That's totally different. That's modern. That's a modern bodybuilder. Like that guy, that guy could never fight in the UFC match. She would never, I mean, unless he won in the first 30 seconds, which is possible. Does the only way he'd be able to do it, he just wouldn't have the juice. Does no way. You'd have the capacity to fight for five frowns. There's just no way. Muscle or current statutes like new statutes that are made today of naked men are their cocks the same size. It's a very good question. I'm so glad you're here.

Speaker 4:          01:19:48       Let's go look. Let's look for giant Cox on naked. Homosexual. Least a lot of rumors times are changing. We just a lot of rumors, but what do I look for that new? That's black cock. Cause Google. Yeah. This duplo olive garden. Black Cock. Seven eat anything around here. Jerky. We got some Cherokee. No. What you want. Oh wait, we give you some food. But if you talk into the microphone way, he never one's going to be mad at you. Oh, I won't. Jeff Ross trove through traffic. Did you Uber. Uber. Did you have a feel uncomfortable at all? Why did you ever get a an uncomfortable Uber driver? Oh, I,

Speaker 3:          01:20:32       it's only annoying when they're, you know, they want to talk to you about, you know, they want to come into the show like, well, like, yeah. I only hate if you're on a date because then you have some other dude's just listening to your [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:20:44       bullshit. Oh yeah. You're trying to get some thanks dude. Those cashews are very yummy. All that stuff's good. Those bars are great. It's pro bars. Those are the best. I won't make any noise, but if I do, I'm so don't worry about it. Don't mind having a good time. Enjoying the vibe. Um, you were at the roast battle pretty much every week when you're in town, right? Yeah. That was a Jim Carrey last night. That was the first place that I went back to when I came back to La, came back to the comic store. The roast battle was one of the reasons why I did it. It's a movement is a movement, right? It feels like, it feels like, like I was talking about this on the message board today. Someone was bringing up, uh, I, it might've been trolling, I might've got sucked into a troll. It's actually about the old days. Guys used to, uh, borrow each other's jokes and you know, it was like a tighter community back then. It was like, man, I don't know about all that, but I think this is the tightest community ever for standup. I think this is the best time ever for standup comedy. I really do as far as like, I love that. Yeah. It's like you love what you just did. Montreal all comedy

Speaker 3:          01:21:48       festival. I'm hosting odd ball starting next week and I love comedians. I do these festivals because I love being around comics. Yeah. It's like a religion. I feel like it's a real, I feel like I'm a comedian before I'm anything else. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with you. I just want to see comedians hang out with comedians. I remember going to a Christmas party once at Al Roker his house, if I should tell this, but go ahead. And it's very fancy. Upper East side Christmas party for charity fundraiser thing. And I walk in and there's like a, you know, people in Tuxedos taking your coat when you come in and very handing out hors d'oeuvres and big beautiful home fireplace, Christmas music. And I look over at the people that coach people. It's like two, three people just sitting there and Chris Rock. Like he would rather talk to the coat check people. Then these fancy people. He was so bored. And then, and then I walk in, he's like, he ran over to me. He's like, oh my God, a comic. I can talk to a comic. This is so great. It just comics need to talk to comics. That's how I felt last night at this party. It was just like Samsung. Yes. I went to this cool Samsung Party where asap rocky and performed it. And that was really cool. What does that asap rocky is a musician.

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       He's good. Yeah. Yeah. Well I live a bad pitches. That's my fucking problem. Really. I love bad bitches. That's my fucking problem. That's what's the Jeffrey Ross team song. But uh, it was, you know, Super Hollywood Douche, like I hate those kind of people. Uh, it was like in a studio lot where I think right next to Oprah is building a, so we don't know what studio. That was some weird studio lot and it was this humongous party was awesome. Uh, Samsung was showing all their new phones and uh, I didn't want to talk to anyone because everyone was like beautiful models and just like, you know, I was just sitting there like, this is gross. Then I see Stephen Glickman, uh, across the the room. I'm like,

Speaker 4:          01:23:46       I love you. And I'm just like giving them

Speaker 6:          01:23:48       big hug. It was like the best day of my life just because I saw a comedian that I knew.

Speaker 4:          01:23:53       Yeah. I've been in that situation before. It's cool. Those situations are cool when you, you know, you have that camaraderie, you run into someone that you know. Yeah. The old days baby, I used to do a news radio right next to what Greg Geraldo had a sitcom for awhile and Geraldo Sitcom lawn. Yeah. They'll be right next door. And uh, I'd go out, hang with him. We just hang out in the parking lot and shoot the shit. But it was always like, you're not even in an actor, a comedian. Look how x, right. We talk about it and he talked about how frustrating it was. Cause you know, trying to do is show his way, all the producers and every, the, you know, the network and all that jazz that you have to deal with and trying to put together a sitcom. It was like, you know, I just run in Emory.

Speaker 4:          01:24:37       Yeah. There was a few guys like Lanny Clark, Lenny Clarke was also on the set on the a lot rather than, cause he was on that show with John. What the fuck? I want to say Lithgow, but it's not Lithgow. It's the other guy. Larry cat. Yes. Thank you. He was on that show with John Leora cat to John, I guess it was called the John Leora cat show. And uh, I used to, uh, run into Lenny, you know, just run the Lenny. Hey, what the fuck? How I yeah, yeah. I'm doing this fucking show. This cranky bastard was Lithgow. What's fucking scream at everybody? We'd watch the close circuit monitors. Lithgow would get mad. Remember? You're fucking crazy and shit, but you know, you're running into a comic, whether it's at the airport or anything, it's, it's a, it's a nice thing. We're always on the move comics in an airport on a Sunday or a Thursday. Yeah, that would be a good show. Just comics running into each other at an airport,

Speaker 6:          01:25:32       a podcast. He just gets randomly connected with another comic that just happens to be at the same airport.

Speaker 4:          01:25:37       Well, if you did that, you know, like for real, if you want to do a show, say like Dallas is a big port, there's always big ports and you set up a podcast studio in that port and said, you know, we'll be here. We're going to be here from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM let us know if you're coming through. And you know, maybe you could schedule your layover,

Speaker 6:          01:25:58       you could create a studio in one of those like lounges, like the American airline lounge and then you can help the

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       community. And he's like, yeah, hey comedian. Stopped by, you know, the, the comedy louder and celebrities and wants you to do by Kate, by tournament, by my gate. 67. A like, you know what, you could do two. You could have one of those, you know those massage places where they rub your back. You have those let you sit in those chairs that your face goes first. You could do that. Like we'd sit next to each other and get a massage. Talk some shit. How the microphone looking up at us. How's uh, those uh, Asian ladies a rubbing your back. Just make it great idea. It's not a bad idea to just have people lead that are out on a Gig. Right? Where are you going? Here's the idea. It's okay. You do like, you do like women have like a little spa where they get their hands on it.

Speaker 2:          01:26:47       Just do for guys like guys spa. Yeah, but you don't want to get, you want to get your hands done. No, you don't have to maybe do that, but others toes done. Did you get it? You listen to them. You're going to ever play some ping pong. That wouldn't be bad. If there's a spot where you could go and hang out like a bar, like a little, you know the comedy store has that private bar. If you could set something like that. I danced there last night that you dance. It's so fun there. Yeah, got chew. Don't worry about it. He's like hold him, but he's doing very well done and then I to gold this long without knowing what's not about. When I get off stage, I'll do an hour, hour, 15 minutes when I'm headlining and I literally will have, they'll still be clapping and I'll already be halfway through a chicken salad on pita bread.

Speaker 2:          01:27:31       Really? And if you have a second show you'll do that. You'll eat in, which I always eat before the first show we did between the second show was free. I just need food all the time. I can't eat before I go on stage. If I do it slowly go on stage. If I'm hungry, I lose my mind. Really. I'm too mean. I lose. I just wow. Jeff Ross, all those little cranky I, it's not fun for me, but I think it's still funny for the audience cause I used to have an old girlfriend. He used to say the crankier I was the funnier it was like if I got really mad he would just be so fun. That's what she likes. She likes getting dirty. Yeah. That's all.

Speaker 2:          01:28:07       Yeah. I, I try, I try to eat before and I just fall asleep. I like, I mean I feel like I'm really tired stage. You've got to digest that stuff. Like you would never eat before he fought. Even never like have a sandwich and then go fight ever. So like, because you wouldn't have all your resources, your, your body, there's a certain amount of your body that would be breaking down your food. Huh? I guess, but not quite the same as telling jokes for an hour. Not quite the same, but the energy level won't be the same. Your, your energy level, like you, you won't have as much resources dedicated to like, have you ever gone on stage dehydrated? That's a problem. That's bad. That's harder for me. I did just been drinking too much coffee. I haven't slept, haven't had enough water. I was in planning land all day once all day in the summer, like July. It was bad. It was fucking hot as shit and I was there with my kids and we stay the night there.

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       You know, you get a hotel room at the Disneyland Hotel and the whole deal and you know you're, you're fucking going through the park. It's hot as shit as a million people. You might not drink enough water. And that night, man, I hit the wall. I did two shows and the first show I pulled it off at the second show. My fucking head was throbbing and I was thinking of stuff like, I'm really dehydrated here. This is not good. It's probably one of the worst ways to be on stage. It'd be dehydrated. He brain just doesn't work right. She doesn't fire.

Speaker 3:          01:29:29       I told him I had that in Iraq. I got dehydrated and couldn't after a bunch of shows and traveling and not drink enough water and over caffeinating to make up for not sleeping and being nervous. That was what happened. At sent me to the infirmary, to the medical tent in the middle of, I think it was Alice sod or Falucia Jesus Christ with an ivy bag. How many times you've been over there? A couple. Yeah. You like it? I'm not sure what you mean. Well, you were saying that you, it was pretty straight forward question. I love going to Iraq. It is so much specially around my birthday and when I can really party.

Speaker 3:          01:30:06       You were saying that the great clubs and Todd you were saying, you were saying that doing the prison was a lot like doing a u s o Gig in that you're bringing laughs whether normally aren't any and it's, you know, politics and all that and whether people deserve a show and all that. You can just put down the side for a second as a comedian just going in and that challenge of making people laugh that are miserable. I love that. You know, I feed off that and we're trying to make my mom laugh when she was sick and stuff. You know, just the, I love that challenge of trying to break somebody who's just a little frozen.

Speaker 7:          01:30:42       Mm.

Speaker 4:          01:30:44       You like a little little, little run up hill.

Speaker 3:          01:30:46       Yeah. Jeff Ross. Yeah, I remember being an early in my career seeing him Buddy Hackett perform. I didn't know him, but I knew his son, Sandy and sandy let me come, uh, by myself, the end of a run in Atlantic city and buddy was there the next day, so I stayed an extra day to see the Buddy Hackett shell this like kind of a late afternoon, early Sunday show. And I remember buddy right out of the gate,

Speaker 3:          01:31:13       saw some lady taking notes. She was a reporter and he didn't know about it ahead of time or whatever. He called her a cunt. Right. And literally the first 45 seconds of walking on stage and just the whole audience taken. Yeah, she was mortified. She tried to say, I'm from the so and so Harold did that. He just wouldn't hear it. And he just called her content. He just put a really weird vibe in the room right out of the gate. And, you know, eventually the show went on and, and it was amazing and I, but literally a decade later, but he became a very close pow and I could ask him anything and I said that you'd never remember this man. But like 10 years ago in Atlantic city at the Trump hat, castle, whatever, some lady, you know, he's like, wow,

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       I go, I go, why would you do that? Like right away, just for no reason. Just what was, how could you imagine what might've been happening in your head buddy? And he's like, he's like, oh, I do that all the time. I like to dig myself a hole just to make it interesting just to see if I could dig myself out of the halt. It does make an interesting, do you do that with new bits? I'll do the new bits sometimes. How do you mean? I keep myself like a pause and a new bit. I'll give myself like a fucking dead end where I've, I have to come up with some way to get out of it like a low myself. Anyway, sometimes you, Tommy Sigora says this best, uh, the best, uh, description of like when a bid is not that good, but you kind of jazz it up and make it good.

Speaker 4:          01:32:44       You try too hard. He calls a dance moves, you know, like I'll have a bit, and I, I, the way I used to say, I said I used to call it English like English and acumen along. Yeah, it's spinning around too much. I might, those balls are spinning around too much. It's too much English on this fucking set. It's just too much nonsense and jazz, you know? But Tommy had a better expression, dance moves and that's what kind of what it is sometimes like sometimes a bit, it's not that good. Like it's, it starts out kind of good. You have an idea and you're trying to figure out which way to take it. But sometimes you jazz it up too much with the performance but not enough with substance and you just kind of try to figure out what's the, what's the line between those two things.

Speaker 4:          01:33:22       You know, how to hold you up sometimes when you know you got something and you're developing it and you have a couple of tent poles that maybe you won't need once the whole thing's bills. It's like a, it's like a scaffolding. Yes. That's how I describe it. The same way I was having a conversation with Tony Hinchcliffe about this, cause it was a subject that, it was a little kid, he was doing a subject that was kind of mean and I said, you're dedicating a lot of time to this bit that I know you don't really think like this. Like you don't mean this. Right. And he goes, no. I'm like, well what if somebody has this disease is in the audience and they hear this or someone who knows somebody. I go, you're taking all this time and creativity and you're putting it together with something you don't necessarily believe in.

Speaker 4:          01:34:01       And I said, you got to think of a bit as like a subject is the scaffolding. And then inside that scaffolding you put all your material and that's what you're doing. You know? And when you create a new bit, sometimes you do have those dance moves. Sometimes you do have those and sometimes I'll just chop them down and leave and I'll start it out good. And I'll just hope there's a pathway that opens up in my brain when I'm in the moment and contemplating the bit where I know there's a lull there and I know I got to dig myself out of the lull. Maybe I'll find it and I don't find it. Sometimes I don't find it. You know, sometimes like sometimes you'll do a bit three, four times and you're like, I'm ready to abandon this motherfucker. And then boom, something pops up and you're like, oh, this is it. All this is it. You go back to it. Yes. Or you go back to it. Yeah, he take a little time off. Put it aside. You know what else I noticed? I don't think this happens as much anymore, but you'll have a bit that you're not. When I was beginning, this

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       is good for beginning comics. You have a bit that's okay. And you know, he kind of like it but it doesn't quite work. And I went back to old notebooks or it just came back to me one night. Um, and when you become a better performer and you can sell them more different type of bit, it's more in your new voice or your can just sell it better. Or you know the English better like you say and you can go back to an idea that you, you weren't ready for. Yeah. Like maybe you didn't see the the way out, right? You didn't see the pathway fit with your bullshit act that you were doing when you were starting. Yes. I like, how are you doing this right now with a fucking mouthful of food? Like a squirrel, but you're completely professional. You tuck it all the side Shit, monks style and you didn't chew once on the mic. Brian Cowen can learn from you. I've been doing this awhile. This is my first podcast. Joe Rogan. Do you have a podcast? No. How the fuck is that possible? I, I don't know. I could barely work a garage door opener. This would be really hard for me. Just get somebody like Jamie or Brian to do it so I don't have a fucking remodeled garage that I can put up. Three pictures of Elvis. Jimmy still trying to figure out a Rosa Rosa parks. Really? Yeah. Okay. She was hot.

Speaker 2:          01:36:14       No, no. Casey. No, you're just crazy. Now we know your type. Let the record show al Qaeda has the same decorators is the Joe Rogan studio. Really just in the Rosa parks saying pictures of, I found out that Hendricks is not the real fucking Hendricks mugshot from Toronto. Yeah, sons of bitches. Wow. They sold this to me and Hawaii too. That's a iconic Jimi Hendrix photo that they stuck on. The actual writing from when his mugshot was, I bought the real mugshot. Jamie, do we have it in the back? Don't worry about it. I got the real mugshot from Hendrix, so that will be replaced with the real one. Interesting. So they, my new studio, I'll take it. You can tell you actually, this is all very cool. Thank you. Um,

Speaker 6:          01:37:02       do you know a youtube star or have you ever heard of a guy named Joey grass stuff? Uh, grasp this guy right here. Uh, this guy right here? No. Uh, so he is like this really super popular famous Youtube Star I guess. And there was this guy named Brock Baker, a really funny comedian and writer here in Los Angeles and he makes these really funny videos called angry man. And he did this thing and he talks about this youtube star because he has a book out. And if you read the back of the book, what it says on the back of the book cover, it is one of the most creepiest things ever. The guys 24 and all his fans are like young kids, like, like eighth grade to like 13, 14, 15. You know, kind of like the twilight or kids. That's his fans. That's his fans. And He's 24, uh, if you've read the back, Jamie, do you have it pulled up? Because it'd be funnier if you check this out. Read this

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       right here. It's not what you begin that matters. It's where you end up. Go ahead. All right. 24 year old Joey, whatever has captured the hearts of more than 4 million teens and young adults through his playful, sweet and inspirational youtube presence. Not to mention his sparkling eyes and perfect hair. This is like a book about him and he has his on the back of his car anyways. Uh, Joey wasn't always comfortable in his skin and in this candid memoir, he thoughtfully looks back on his journey from pain to pride, self doubt to self acceptance. That's an important message. If you just Google this guy's name, the images that come up is some of the funniest shit ever cause he, he really does. Like, he's in love with his hair. So you just made another enemy. Just like you said, you're going to run it in the next Samsung par.

Speaker 2:          01:38:46       Are you going to see this fucking guy? He's going to want to feed you your teeth. It's so funny though. I, I, I dunno, just look at the youtube videos. It's hilarious. He's really addicted to his hair, what we talked about earlier and just write that down and think about whether or not you want to talk about it. Right. Make making fun of it. Oh, yesterday who are really likes his hair, but all his pictures on Google are just perfect hair like this. Okay. Crazy. Johnny Bravo here. Nevermind. It's okay. Good. Look at, it's funny. I'm not going to, but thank you for your suggestion. You're going to look at it later. Jeff Ross, what do you got going on man? Besides odd ball, you got some gigs coming up. University Rhode Island's coming up. I think you're doing, that's interesting. You can do in college is still what?

Speaker 2:          01:39:24       This fucking big backlash lately the kids are saying that everybody's too politically correct to do colleges. Yeah. Well Seinfeld doesn't want to do colleges. Christopher Nolan and I find a really cool college. Do you think so? University of Rhode Island's a good spot. What's a, did they let you do anything and get away with anything? They haven't been given any restrictions. Do you feel like kids are a little bit more sensitive these days though? That's the big people I like. People are more sensitive. Do you think they're more sensitive or do you think they have the opportunity to complain more? Both. I think it's become, you know, the egg before the chicken and the egg because I don't know, how's it? I think people are just looking for things that everyone feels like a victim. Everyone's sounds like a victim all the time. I feel offended or I don't have my head to see this or I'm glad to hear that are, you know, they found another guy faking black [inaudible] no, I've seen that in other guy. Part of the black lives matter that I feel like people have been doing this forever. Yeah. But these are like activists that are doing it, which is kind of adorable. It's on Breitbart, young man named Sean King. There's another fake black guy, you know the Rachel Doles all. She claimed to be black, but she was actually white and she said she identifies with black. You know that they found another dude who does the same thing and he's a part of the black lives matter. Oh God. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting.

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       I mean he looks really, really white and, but he has that kind of creepy mustache to some black guys can pull off. There's his dad. His mom is white as well. There's photos of him as a young kid, totally white, but talked about his struggles of being an African American. How's, he was always bullied and throws a lot of pictures up against that are black and white. And here's the thing, you know, there's nothing wrong with being a white guy that works for black tweeted lot of my blackness. Then yours, Daddy said, oh my God, awesome. He's got black sunglasses on or glasses and agriculture. What does that, does that mean? Oh, I hate those Goddamn popups. I feel like I'm color blind. I don't even see, I don't even assess people's race right away. Me Neither, man. I'm fucking completely colorblind in the human and natural progression of the way people think.

Speaker 4:          01:41:47       Just weird, weird people like this are going to crop up. Whoa. This guy that I really like, Milo Yiannopoulos, I'm not exactly sure how to say his, his last name correctly, but it's Nero. Any r o on a, on Twitter and a, he's a fucking funny writer man. And he's a really good speaker too. He's hilarious on these. Uh, he does his interview shows and he's, uh, he's always like saying logical things and having logical arguments against feminists. If you, uh, if you like Google some of these Milo Yiannopoulos and they can't fucking say anything about him because he's gay and he has blonde hair and he's super articulate. So because he doesn't look like, you know, like one of the guys from Jersey shore, he's not like, you know, a lot of these guys that are representing men's rights, they, Kyle look douchey. You know, they kind of look like Bros. He's gay.

Speaker 4:          01:42:40       So because, and he's open about it and he's fabulous and he's got a great vocabulary. But when he's, when he's describing or when he's giving these arguments in debating rather these women, he's crushing them cause it's like it was talking about diversity in science and he's like, well the cold hard truth is, it's not that women are discouraged from doing science. This is a lot of them aren't attracted to it. Men and women have different states of mind and boys and girls when they're young, if you give them like equal access to toys, boys naturally will gravitate towards like trucks and cars and girls were naturally gravitate towards dolls. It has nothing to do with it. Yeah. Here's, here's one of them on Sky News. Why men are better at chess, listen to by look at them. You feel about being different because of your hard wired differently. So it's not something you've have a failed to hear before. It just seems to keep cropping up. Is it necessary?

Speaker 8:          01:43:35       It's just, it's ridiculous. It's his 50s thinking, you know, I mean it's just so ridiculous. This biological determinism, frankly, you know, interests and talent and you know, passions for particular topics, subjects or arts, whatever. Like they're not relegated to either gender, but unfortunately because of some stereotypical thinking, often one gender is encouraged to pursue, you know, a sport or an art more so than the other. And my colleague at the Telegraph, Radica Sigourney, she wrote a piece just this morning speaking to, um, like young girls who play chess and actually what she found out that they're dropping out at the age of 12 probably because you know, they're not encouraged or you know, there's, I don't want to me telling them that it's not for them, it's not called, et Cetera, et cetera. So you know, this hardwired brain staff like is it's retro sexism, Barlow, you're not plus bashed, smiling, laughing.

Speaker 8:          01:44:43       Ben and women are wired differently, have different skills. No, it doesn't matter in the sense that they are equal but different. But it simply isn't true to say that there is no difference whatsoever between the attitudes of men and women. And it is without question true that there are some biological differences between men and women. And we know that from our anatomy. But we also know it from experiments that we do on young children. Before they've had the opportunity to be socialized, the sorts of toys that they go for. And that holds true. Actually for them it's the animal kingdom as well. Some of the reasons why girls drop out of stem subjects at college and, uh, chess clubs is because they keep losing. And one of the reasons they keep losing is that it does seem to be the case that chess as a game plays to some of the male intellectual virtues.

Speaker 8:          01:45:26       And when Simon Baron Cohen talks about this, is he, the way he describes it as men are good at systematizing and women are good at empathizing and there is some reason to suppose that that may have some basis in biology. It's very trendy these days to say that everything is socially determined, but that's not what the science says. And it's not either what common sensors, because if it were true these days, there would be a lot more representation of women in the sciences, in astrophysics, in philosophy, in mathematics, and in chess. But there isn't so ready. Does that, does that make sense? That's,

Speaker 4:          01:45:57       that's done. That chick should just go home. She just pooped hers just go home. Cause it's true. That's the idea. It says is that saying that men are better or women are better, but the idea that there's no difference between us and biological determinism is bullshit. It's just ridiculous. So that dude is hilarious and he's the guy who busted this guy. He's the guy who I had the article on Breitbart about this guy who's actually white, pretends to be black. He's great though. I love his writing. I love listening to him talk. The guys just, he nails it every time. It was hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. He'll be on soon. He's going, he'll be on here and a couple of weeks working something out. Hmm. Jeffrey Ross is here now though and now he's had some food. Expertly eaten off Mike and Nobody would know anything if you didn't call. I been all carved up and rejuvenated and what you did,

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       I love how you handled it. Did it professional, got to watch some fucking bullshit about shit. I don't care about you. Care about fucking knew. What do you think about Trump? What do you think about Trump? I feel like he has a Charlie sheen writing is material. We're nature. Nova loses. I need to be aware as, yeah. If he wins. I said this at the comedy store last night. If he wins a, it's proof that there's an Illuminati in this country or he's a part of it or he's a part of it. But that seems unlikely that he's a part of the Illuminati. Yeah. Why would they want to billionaires and the Illuminati? He's rogue. He's on his own. He's fucking crazy. I've roasted them a couple times. Yeah. He's a good sport. He doesn't show it, but he is really, what's he like as a person?

Speaker 2:          01:47:38       Uh, he's engaging and he likes to ask a lot of questions about Mexicans. Nah, we were on a pleasure trip. Got Into Mara Largo on his plane. Me and Bruce Smear Knauf really quite a while ago. Nice. Be Back in the day. I haven't heard that name. And forever. I was very generous. He, Bruce Knauf. Yeah. The proofs and I on, on Trump's plane. I remember the Donald in the nineties yeah. Something like that. No, early two thousands I think. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So you're chilling on his plane. We go down to Mara Largo you have in Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump's golf country club facility. They're very fancy, very beautiful. And he gave us a Cadillac Bruce Tonight at tool around with for the weekend. I did a show on the Saturday night. Donald brought me up himself. Really? Not An easy crowd, I wouldn't think so. You know, very formal, you know the whole thing.

Speaker 2:          01:48:34       Bunch a creepy one percenters on Adderall, but a very, very elegant and in the end, very appreciative crowd. And I roasted them at the friars club once when I roasted them on comedy central ones. I remember him not laughing at all for like three comedians and I went up to him and during the commercial break and I'm like, Donald, you have to at least smile so we have something to cut to other than other people laughing at you. And he's like, oh, okay. I get it now. I think sort of smiling and enjoying himself a little bit. That's hilarious. That's a what? A what a weird guy. He is, Huh? He's in a strange there is right there. Nice and orange. Yeah. What's the orange all about? He wears a lot of makeup. Is that makeup or is that like Spray Tans Shit from my HDTV, I'd always looks like caked on makeup. He's got the original kissy face. Go back to the lessor to push, get a plus on sourpuss but there he doesn't have it. So what does he do in the how? That's powder Donald Trump. You think it's possible that he could win? How close do you think he's going to get? Oh man,

Speaker 4:          01:49:49       he's, he's kind of a shoe in for the Democrats is what he is. What do you mean? Because a lot of people that would vote Republican are going to vote for him if he stays in. If he stays in, it's gonna make thing. Especially if he goes independent, which is totally possible. Right? If he goes independent, he could be Ross Perot in this motherfucker. He could, a Ross Perot sunk the ship of Herbert Walker Bush because everybody was torn between who to vote for. There was a libertarian people that would have maybe possibly voted more fiscally conservative. So they had gone with the Republicans and instead they went with Ross Perot cause he was laying it down how the taxes were and what the fuck was actually going on. Whereas, uh, that, that like opened the door for Clinton. What do you think about Bernie Sanders? Uh, like, um, like what he's saying about education and all I fucking hate when people say, you know, yeah, that's great.

Speaker 4:          01:50:39       Good at fucking people. Be Nudge gay on my tax dollars. What about more tax dollars? What about war that you know, how much more it costs to go to war than it costs to educate people? You know, don't you think it would be better if we had less people that were uneducated in this country or if we had less people that were leaving college in fucking massive debt? If you're a kid, okay, if you're 18 to 21 years old, which is most people that are in college, you don't need to be saddled down with hundreds of thousands of dollars in education debt. That's fucking gross. It's gross. And it's stupid and it speaks to poor management of our civilization. That's what I think about our situation in America when it comes to colleges and the amount of money that kids get straddled down with saddled down rather with debt, they're fucked. You know, especially if you go, if you talked to someone who goes to medical school, Jesus Christ, right?

Speaker 4:          01:51:28       My friend was, he was hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt before he, he, before he left a medical school, hundreds of thousands of dollars just fucked. Like it takes you forever to make that money because you don't just make the hundreds of thousands of dollars. You gotta make a living too and incentivize you to deal with the system the way it is and not adapt to some new, yeah, health plan in this country, whatever. You've just got to get your nut while it becomes a game becomes a game. Just like the cop thing, we're talking about the comp thing, cops, it becomes a game of convicting people, going after people, convicting them, getting the win, getting the victory. Well with doctors, it becomes a matter of getting people to have surgery. I had um, a friend of mine telling me he started when he was 16 years old, he was working as a like a like some vacation resort, you know, he's working on, it's like somebody who works at the resort and he said he overheard these fucking doctors talking about talking someone into getting an operation and they were going chit chain.

Speaker 4:          01:52:25       They were just talking about how the, you know, I talked him into getting this and that means I get this, like they were talking about it like a guy who was talking about selling Chevys. It's like [inaudible] these all doctors that they were together. So just like comics would get together and shoot the shit. Doctors get together and shoot the shit. What did you do? I told him I got a fucking fake knee given each other knock goals, any goes. It changed forever the way I thought about doctors. He goes, I, I left. You know what didn't work there anymore. I never thought about doctors the same way because of that conversation those guys had. I would've never been privy to that in any of the circumstances. But a few guys sitting around at a resort having a couple of cocktails, again, a little loose with the lip, he found out what they were really all about.

Speaker 4:          01:53:07       It's because they're fucked. They're fucking, they're, they're, they're fucked. Not just with the amount of money that they have to pay for their education, but also malpractice insurance is crazy. My cousin is a surgeon. He was in practice in New Jersey for years and said, fuck it. I'm going to work for an emergency room where I share. And it just took a lot of pressure off him in his life and I think he got happier and probably became a better doctor. Yeah, well that's what I think a lot of responsibility, a lot of red, you know, constant work to run the practice, act yourself. It is. It is. And you know, people do do need to be protected. I mean, there are doctors at fuck up. We showed that lady who got her feet fucking amputated in her hands amputated and they fucked up. But she, they'd literally amputated the wrong person's feet and hands. He's fucked up.

Speaker 6:          01:54:00       You see this Sarah Silverman, uh, Bernie Sanders video. She did a speech for him. It was really powerful and it, and it's really cool that she did that because you know, uh, Bernie somebody, I think a lot of people, younger people, uh, would like also like, cause I'm Facebook, a lot of the younger people I'm friends with, uh, or always posting burns.

Speaker 4:          01:54:21       My friend's a little kids, man. The fuck's going on talking to six year olds. No, but did you see the uh, the giant rallies that he's put together and including one in la? There's like 18,000 people. So you have them in la. That's great. Well the, he gives you a hope that there's some, someone that represents a more open minded, a more current point of view, I think. And I think, you know, there's this fucking like Ted Cruz and all these people that are running and they're like, you're like, Ooh, I like is you like you look at them and you go, this guy can't win Kenny, can he win? Lucky you seek guys like that and you go, oh, come on Bri. Is this real like Chris Christie? Is that Breal it? Can he really, when you get more standoffish and scared by it than anything, he had to run because of all the scandals he had.

Speaker 4:          01:55:09       Otherwise, what made him seem guilty really, but I think, I think he had had to run node or to go, everything's fine. Yeah. That's an interesting way of looking at it. I'm from New Jersey, just me too. I was born in Newark, me to shut the fuck up. That's crazy. When we born 65 you're older than me. 67 August 11 September 13th Jesus Christ basically two years apart from each other, pal. Here we are. Same Hospital. Maybe. What hospital? Beth Israel. Is that the name of it? I don't even remember. I was hoping would say something and I go, that sounds like mine. Yeah. I'll have to ask my mom. You guys didn't go like know each other at all? We met each other in New York in like 1990 maybe 91 when did you start? What year did you start doing stay? A April fool's day? 1989 wow. Yeah, I started um, in 88, August 27th, 1988 stitches Boston and uh, I made it to New York somewhere on 90 91. It was probably when I met you back it up at catch a rising star. Ah, it didn't, we meet at a Boston comedy maybe. Probably met hosts there and do spots. There is a great little spot. It wasn't, it was good. That was a great little spot. That was one of those really tiny rooms. Like that was a 90 cedar like maybe didn't even see 90 probably something like that. Maybe a little more in the villa. They say 120, but I could be a crazy, let's say a hundred. Yeah, it was a great little spot.

Speaker 3:          01:56:40       Charlie Barnett, there's a cool article about him in the New York Times last week. Trolley Bailey who died of AIDS. Sad, sad, sad story.

Speaker 4:          01:56:48       But

Speaker 3:          01:56:49       he was the king of the park in Washington Square Park and he would go on at that Boston comedy club and the comedy cellar.

Speaker 4:          01:56:56       Well he would do a lot of sets, uh, out on the street. When we do shows in the street, he'd throw his hat down and uh, Dave Chappelle used to like, he learned from him. Right. Chappelle used to do a lot of shows like that where he, I saw him do it in Montreal. We did a show at club soda. I Remember Club Soda. It's still there. Yeah, it's a call that something different now, isn't it? I think so. Anyway, they did a, we did a show at club soda and then outside Dave just starts just like gather round, gather round, and he starts doing standup.

Speaker 3:          01:57:24       Got All that from Charlie. Yeah. Dave and I both lived on the sides of that park and we used to watch Charlie all the time. And then I think when Charlie passed away, Dave kind took over that mantle in the fountain on the weekends and sometimes during the week and he really found his voice I think in that park. So you guys used to go and watch Charlie perform in the powers and just hang out with like, it was great. It was, you know, you had to get your work done back then we lived in small apartments. He, there were no cell phones and you weren't, you had to do whatever you were going to do. If there was an email or phone call, you had your phone in your house and you went and did all that and you left messages and got messy and you went out and when you were out you were present in the moment and you are loving every second of it. Dave and I would hang around Washington square park and try to talk to Nyu girls who are studying and whatever we could do and find some weed and we would brainstorm and write jokes and we'd eat lunch in the park and listen to music. There was always a, the acrobats were in the park and, and masterly karate, he comic would come. And Charlie Barnett, this guy that was just hilarious would, you know, like you said, he would jump up on the fountain show time. It's showtime and all jokes are real simple

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       and he could work the crowd. A homeless guy walks by, he had a joke. Japanese tourists walks by. He had a joke in mimic him, you know, and you know, uh, it was a great show for anyone. Eight to 80, rich or poor. Even if you don't speak English, you're laughing at Charlie. He was so physical and funny and, and it was a great time. I remember there were riots in Los Angeles. It might've been Rodney king and we got warnings in New York to be careful. It might be riots in New York and trolley. Walk me home. He's like, yeah, I'm going to have your end word walk, walking home.

Speaker 2:          01:59:22       Just really endearing. And I loved him. He was what? He was supposed to do, siren live. But apparently when he got there they realized that he couldn't read. Yeah. It's kind of a crazy story, you know? I mean they, he was like a hot comic. A lot of people wanted him to do things, but he didn't know how to read. I don't know. He was super, super funny. It's interesting that he had that style, you know, that style influenced a lot of people, that style of like doing street comedy, you know, just gathering a crowd out of nowhere. I never had the guts to go on outside like that, but Chappelle watched them and watched them and watched him and Charlie sort of bringing them up every now and then he let them do a few minutes and eventually Dave, that just became one of his chapters.

Speaker 2:          02:00:09       It was amazing to watch. Charlie was loud and his jokes were really short. Dave was more soft spoken and his jokes were longer. To see that in the park was fascinating because the park had to come to Dave a little bit and you've really saw at least I really saw having hung out there every night that every day. You know, sometimes Dave would do a few couple of shows on a Sunday in the park and he'd make real fans and he got a real sense of who he was right there doing that. I mean it was magic to see uh, a young genius in the middle of the public just being him and having the public come to him gravitate to him. Uh, it was once in a lifetime thing to say. That's cool. I got a chance to see him perform at catch a rising star when he was, he might've been 18 thing. How old's Dave now don't ask. Look on the fucking computer cause you got a computer in front of 45. How it is stage of Hill. Okay, so he's six years, seven years younger than me. So that doesn't even make sense. So cause I was only like 23 how, how's that? Is that true? Maybe he didn't get that right. 41 that doesn't make sense. He's 42 because he was born August 24th, 1973 and

Speaker 6:          02:01:39       I was born in 74 and I'm 41 means he turns 45 days from now. This is the 24th, 1973 though. He's 42 next week. Next week. Next week is 42.

Speaker 4:          02:01:55       He got mad, dammit. My math skills. Uh, so, uh, so if he's 42, um, I must fuck man, that doesn't make any sense. I guess maybe I was too. So He's six years younger than me, so I was, man, that seems weird because that was really early twenties. I was like 21 or 22 at the most. I was 24. I was doing comedy is high schools too. Yeah, I guess he was 18 and I was 24. That, that makes sense now that I think about it. But, uh, I got a chance to see him at catch a rising star. I was like, wow, what a precocious young man. He was like so advanced for his age and it was a a lot like, um, uh, Tony Woods. I remember Tony Woods or also from DC. Hilarious guy. I think Tony and him probably work together

Speaker 6:          02:02:46       together. I think they will fully admit that he was influenced by Tony. Tony. They were, you know, they were good buddies. I think they still are. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:02:55       Um, you always had this love for the older comics, like always. I remember that like you were one of the first guys going to the friars club and I was like, look at Jeff and his fucking twenties is hanging out the Friar's club.

Speaker 3:          02:03:07       I a love for all comics and that's where the older comics were and they had, they were smart. I learned a lot just about how life works. Not just show business. That's obvious. You get to talk to an older comic about show business. But I would talk to Buddy Hackett for it hours about guns and pussy and politics and travel and food and booze. And he knew everything.

Speaker 4:          02:03:29       Isn't it weird that there's a club Friar's club like dead dedicated Comedians, club

Speaker 3:          02:03:35       comedy show business? I see politicians and musicians, they're agents, lawyers. Is that still going on? Thriving? The Friar's club on 55th street between park and Madison in New York City. So it's not just comics? No, it wasn't always just comics. No, it's well known for the roast comics are identified with it, but it's a fraternity for show business, basically a show business themed club and it's in New York and in La is the one and only in New York. Only in wasn't la for a long, long time, but not anymore. When did it, uh, when Milton Berle died had kind of died with him. What year was that? 10 years ago I think.

Speaker 4:          02:04:11       Hmm. Wow.

Speaker 6:          02:04:13       You ever meet Bob Hope? I never met Bob Hope. And that's, uh, I met him once. What was that like? I was just a kid, but he was very nice. He, uh, he was golfing and I was at the memorial tournament and uh, there was this huge crowd of people and he was just walking by and he just looked over at me for some reason, just walked up to me and goes, hey kid. And he signed my, uh, uh, like the little paper thing and then just away. Didn't take anyone

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       else's like photos or a sign, anyone else's shit. I didn't even do anything different. Like he just came right up. It was weird. Well back in those days there was not that many photos because you didn't have a camera on me when I met Bob hope everybody's got a camera on them now I'm at honey young men, Henny Youngman when I was a little kid and he gave me a card and I still have it. I mean I kinda like that charity in your pocket. You just pointed. You would just reach for your wallet. Do you still have it? No, I do, but not on me. It was a music note with his name, with his autograph. He played violin and his, actually, he had a music. Take my wife, take my wife please. He was a funny guy. He, his picture is still hanging up at the friars club by Leroy Neiman. A beautiful painting. There's no, it's like a living, breathing museum of show business

Speaker 4:          02:05:27       places like that in la anymore. No. Too Bad, Huh? Yeah. Or they're that many old comics that are still kicking around.

Speaker 2:          02:05:34       Well, you know there's always an an old comic. Yeah. Yeah. He might not be from the Dean Martin from Fryers, you know, Co celebrity roast era, but there's always a new old comic.

Speaker 4:          02:05:48       Have you ever seen some of the memorabilia they have laying around at the store from back when it used to be Ciro's and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis used to perform that haven't, oh, you got to go into the office and see some of the cool posters and that old ciro sign was Bugsy Siegel's joint. Pretty wild. Fuck all. That's why everybody thinks it's haunted. They think so many people were killed. There is a tunnel in the back of the comedy store that did they close it off as it closed off?

Speaker 2:          02:06:11       Yeah, it's closed off by concrete I think. Right?

Speaker 4:          02:06:14       Something, I dunno, but there was a tunnel that went from the comedy store up the hill to a house that like people could escape through where they could fucking move shit too. You know, the comedy store is just filled with catacombs and says fucking so clustered and confusing. If you don't know your way around that place. Of your some cop and we'll confirm Meyer Lansky and he fucking just skirts out the back and I've seen both the hill and stuff. That's what it looked like. Wow. Go big screen on that. Fuck man. Look at that. That's the main rule, man. Holy Shit. How weird is that? Because you kind of recognize it a little bit. It's like Jessica Rabbit should come out and start singing, which probably would be dead back then or some facsimile. Whoa, look at that. That's what the stage looks like. Maybe that might not be the same place that seems off, but the other one was Ciro's, right? Yeah. Wow. Who was the girl? A stripper stripper. Lil Saints for, what was her name? Let's see here. Lili St Cyr. See why are, how do you say that? Performing at Ciro's nightclub. A stripper at Ciro's. Wow. How weird.

Speaker 2:          02:07:27       Great. What are these old ladies watching this? It looked like, scroll down and look at the photo down. Look at that. That's the fucking front of store, man. That's

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       nuts. That is not God. It looks so similar to where it looks like that car. That's a cool old car. My those cars are worth a fuck load of money. Now. That house isn't there anymore. Right. That's where the hotel is to the right of it or chop their pitch down. But that's definitely the store. Like the patio there. Still intact. Look at the sign. Sammy Davis Jr. Wow. Who's that guy? Will Mastin? That was his dad was it? Yeah. Really. His uncle, that was his uncle he worked with. Wow. Look at that. Everybody pulling in the front. Fuck. That's crazy to see. It's crazy to see a plug. That's the fucking back parking lot, man. That's the side area. Jesus Christ. That is so weird. It's so weird to see that place like that. Wait, so that's where the belly room is, right? I think, isn't it? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:08:32       I mean doesn't that look like the corner? It looks totally like the corner and so I guess there's a sign in the front or was it the front of the building know that has to be mark as a front of the building. Yeah, that's up front. They just, it just looked way different. It was just set up way different. Wow. It's amazing. There's so much history in that place, that place it feels like like comedy, musical chairs too. Cause it feels like the music's going to stop and everyone's going to be really sad because when Mitzi dies, who knows what that place is going to become? What is it? Who is that guy? What the fuck was that? What was, what the hell is that? What is that guy doing when his dick as he thrown a girl up in the air. Okay.

I wonder if anybody's ever done a documentary on Ciro's. New York doesn't really have a club like that. Huh? They don't have an old club. Like what's the oldest club in New York? Comedy cellar. But that's like the 80s right? No settles seventies that's pretty old. So seller is the oldest place you think so a comic strips have been here a long time, but nothing is like, this catch was great. That was a great little room. That was a great little spot, man. This is freaking me out. These photos of Ciro's you, you go back and forth, you go back and forth from New York to La and New York and La. I'm bi-coastal so you just have fun. Just do whatever the fuck you want. Well, I mean kind of live in a dream Jeff Ross, things are good but you kind of live in a dream, you know the way you do it. It just, I see you dick and pictures like there was a picture of you the other day with Ray Romano and the seller and then boom, all of a sudden you're at the store. You know like you would just hop back and forth and Ari's doing that to ours. Your peers doing that too? I like it man. I like, you know, you make the world smaller and I don't, I'm happy

Oh boy. I never met Woody Allen. That would be cool. What do you think that conversation would be like? I had to keep it about comedy. Yeah, you'd have to. If you ventured into girls that would get a little weird sweaty. It'd be a fun conversation. You think so? I think he would. We would open up to a comic before he would open up to anybody else. Don't you felt like you'd just tell Woody Allen everything? Me? Yeah, definitely. Pull them aside and be like, he'd be very open minded maybe. Who knows? You know? It's all depending on who you're listening to. If you listen to me or feral. No, not so much, you know? But he's obviously a creative genius obviously, but you know, I got to know Mel Brooks.

He's a purple heart, Silver Star recipient, World War II army medic, helped liberate a concentration camp, dined all over the world, best restaurants in the world was a caterer, had a great life, outlive two wives, loved them both. He's never been to la. I said, what do you want to do? If he could meet, do anything, what would do? He's like, I like to beat Bill Brooks. I was like, well, what's your second choice? Because that's not happening. And you know, he's coming and he's coming in and it's getting closer and so fuck it. I write a letter to mail books. A letter. Yeah. Wow.
