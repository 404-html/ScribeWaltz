Speaker 1:          00:00          The general good experience,

Speaker 2:          00:02          it was a place in Australia and the, the property owners like the ranch has called me up and they said you need to come out and shoot some of the boxes. Like they'd devastating our lambs and uh, I end up going out there and when I was driving in with a full drive at night with the high beams on, I seen this massive big black and white ball walking between the flock of sheep with a laminates mouth. It was these pig and it got a taste for meat and it happens all the time. Like so a big bore, especially a mature animal, will get a taste for meat in harsh conditions. And now just stick the meat after that. And ended up catching up with these pig the next morning and shot it with a bow. It actually attacked me. The first shot wasn't perfect and it charged me and I ended up stabbing it to death.

Speaker 2:          00:45          I was on a slope like this on the mountain cheese and it was really a battle like high end up hooking the ball out of my hand because when he charged me I'll put an Arrow and shot and just went down one side and hit one lung and it just infuriated this bowl and he was on me and when I was sending him off with the bow is tasked, went into the bottom of the bow or the cam or something like that and rip the bow out of my hand and I ended up getting a knife off me and I ended up stabbing this pig was electronic. Run me over. Oh Shit. How big was it? It was a big boys like big mountain. It made eight and bullet like this and like how many pounds, you know, a fucking big 10. Many pounds. Probably not 300 hour mountain bullshit.

Speaker 2:          01:27          Get real solid. Yeah, probably $200. Something like that. And uh, anyway, I ended up stabbing this thing to death and when I ended up cutting it open, it's whole insides, like it's whole stomach was like lambs hawks, like the feet, the bottom of the feet where they can't swallow and skulls and just like little bits of wool and stuff like that. He'd just been going around and just picking these lambs often killing them and it's a really known occurrence in Australia and how that if things get hard, I would just go just because they, they just absolutely ruthless. I would just walk right between the sheep and just fucking grab a land walk off of chewed up and Ada.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Yeah. And how much comes out in the fucking forest, Bro. That's where the next note, one or swamp thing happened while I was thinking this, once they found out that in some plants some plants contain DNA from salmon because the salmon were used as fertilizer by the plant as it decomposed. It got into the actual plant itself. And you can actually somehow or another through some sort of scientific process that I'm too stupid to understand. They can actually detect salmon in the actual plant itself. We're close. So if you were whacking off on that tree and that tree, it's everyday. That's your spot. You went down to that titty tree and whacked off on the roots and then like after a while you did an analysis and you found your dna in the tree itself. Imagine. Oh, it'd be great, man. If it maintains the information of everything that whacked off on it.

Speaker 1:          02:54          You have a little son made out of wood one day mom, your dad. A kid in our town one time. Does he go, I made a son a wooden shirt that I tell you that a wooden. Sure. Yeah. He made his son a shirt out of plywood for Christmas. What do you want a kid to wear it? Oh, Yay. Did. And I remember I was um, wait a minute. Is it a stiff shirt or is it you make it like little itty bitty tiny pieces of plywood and weave it all together? Oh No, I was pretty stiff and the dad was a um, like an Elvis impersonator, you know? But Dad was an Elvis impersonator at a casino or did he do it at carnivals this locally? Um, but we didn't even meet him that. No, no money really. I think he's probably an alcoholic, but he had a, he had four kids and one of them he made.

Speaker 1:          03:43          I was going walking home one night and I heard them in the garage and he's making like a son, like a, like a for Christmas. Like a wooden shirt, like a, you know. There you go. Uh, not as nice. That one is nice. Wouldn't shirt? Yeah. Can you get sore? Oh, but that's a. like a sculpture. Yeah. That's nice. Can you just get one more? That's like a, like if you go over someone's house and they have a wooden shirt on a hanger, like and they think that's cute. Just leave. Now people are assholes now. This kid needed it because people used to this kid. Is that salmon? Yeah, it's a framed wouldn't shirt. It looks like we used to beat him up because it was wooden shirt now people used to beat him up anyway on the bus. Well the wouldn't share. It would protect you from a lot of shots and it helped and it helped.

Speaker 1:          04:29          He didn't wear that, wouldn't. Sure. You better shut the fuck. I swear to God. He did not walking around with wood over his body like that. Not Today. That would be. Yeah. This was your pads inside of it looked heavy. Fuck. No, dude. I think his dad is estee lauder ladies place, so to play devil's advocate here so that that stuff that comes in those dick pills and you can get from other steroids, but it happens to be in those days. You certainly can. Yes, but. But that is one narrative that you took clear that you could say, well it's in these dick pills. I'm not saying you can't do that. That's true, but it's in such a small amount in his body and it wasn't in his body before and it wasn't in his body after which showed that it was only in his body and extremely small amounts for a small window amount, but a small window of time.

Speaker 1:          05:14          So it's not like he had it. It's not even like this stuff, which is a metabolite which is showing a response to the body, the body responding to the steroids. And let me ask this, Joe. Okay. Why does no other fighter have any Pico Pico grant that this pulsating effect really? Well, that's not true. I mean other tested. Frank Mir tested positive for something two years. Tom Law, our tests, but Frank Mir didn't go through the same steps that Jon Jones did. He didn't provide them with A. I forget what the exact there was. There was something that John did also that lowered his sentencing reform it. Yes. It was cooperating with Usada yeah. Or, or agreeing to cooperate with Usada. Yeah. That then were just cool with that. Listen, I don't even know what that means. I don't either. But let me ask you this. If I agreed to Usada to be an informant, snitches get stitches.

Speaker 1:          06:20          Correct. Unless you're John, that no one can beat you up, so you're fine. But the thing is, is the only way I can inform you is if something that have that, um, knowing that I know of, I can inform you of just stuff that's like, you lay shit. That was what I asked Novitsky I was like, if you didn't do anything wrong, like, and what is he going to offer? Because if, unless he took something, unless you know what you're doing. Like if I'm an informant for the FBI or for the feds for cocaine, I know my cocaine, right? We're not going to get joe blow. That makes my fucking express so we can get the guy who knows the ins and outs of cocaine. That's again, that's, I'm like, all right, cool. Before they have a conversation with him and he says he can provide them with information with how guys are getting away with passing truck to.

Speaker 1:          07:08          And how would you know about that? Unless you're in on that? No, I don't either. I'm just saying again, to me all of this is a little too much of a coincidence that the best fighter on the planet earth has these issues. The best fight in the planet earth also ran away from a hit and run. Smash into a girl, broke her arm. He also drove his car into a tree. He's a reckless person who takes a lot of chances and he does some, at least in the past, has done some things that are not very wise. This could fall under that. It could fall in correct. Or I began to play devil's advocate. I'm not accusing them of anything. Let's play devil's advocate or a guy who was that Lucy goosey outside the octagon, might've taken some performance enhancing things because that would be the similar traits.

Speaker 3:          07:51          I, I think that, look, there's certain things that this administration is doing foreign policy wise that I think are good. It makes sense. There are other things that I think you just leave you scratching your head. Um, but that's like every administration. I guess my point is we've gotten away from that ability, right? I have conversations. I go out to dinner with folks that, you know, on the, on the, on the hard left. And when you talk to them, they fully believe, fully believe that president trump is a Russian puppet, a winning asset of Putin who is just doing Putin's bidding. And they honestly honestly believe that and nothing is going to shift them off that position. When you have a, you know, that sort of frame of reference, you don't have the ability to look at anything rationally and say, yeah, okay, I like this policy related to China.

Speaker 3:          08:45          It's about time we call them out and say that you obviously have not been a fair trading partner. That's something that every administration has agreed to but has never done anything about. So you would think that everybody will be to say makes sense. Yeah, I like it. Everybody should be able to say the immigration system here in the states is somewhat dysfunctional. It needs fixing. Everybody's talked about that and yet they can't do it because they've got this, this mindset that, that that prevents them from having any sort of conversation, any sort of rational discussion that could lead to some compromise that could then advance the ball and make the government more functional. So

Speaker 4:          09:22          I wasn't even ready for that one. Charlie Murphy told us a story and it's animated. It's on youtube now. Have you and him coming over your house in a limousine and us. It was a lion or a tiger. Tiger. Tiger dude. It is one of the craziest fucking stories. I always win. So for people that don't know, I got to hang out with you at one of my shows one time and it was a great. I had the best time talking about everything. What made you think you could get a tiger? Like how did that even happen? Hey, I'm in. Um, I'm. So, I'm, I'm in prison at the time, so I'm in prison. I'm talking to my car dealer at the time and he has, uh, he has, um, caused the, belonged to a friend of mine that's both a friend of ours and he's discussing the feet other than paying for these cars. I'm a fellow cars to someone and get some horses and stuff. I said, well, you can get a hold of because I had a lot of carbs after I probably get them off. You get, you get cool. Good Lions, tigers. I know this guy got exactly what you do. Can you give me some tigers? Yeah. The Guy told me and the guy from. Imagine how cool that bad because I had a bunch of friends because magnet man, he'd be in the aftermarket for Rami. You haven't tiger right next to you.

Speaker 4:          10:39          Wow. Would be cool. Right after he had gave me some cousins, man when I came home I had those cups right there waiting for me. So you raise them as cups because that's how. That's how you work. Because I would see footage of you like fucking smacking them around and jumping on one of your tires and I was like, Holy Shit. And I had an incident were bathed that their mother, their mother, their babies. Now it never gets. This is a crazy picture. You and your underwear with a tiger on chain. That is. That is one of the. That's you at peak? Crazy. Yeah. And thing. Yeah. Going through my mind. What made me think about my friends and Mike, you can get from from the animals and I think really going to get from everybody. Does it though. Those are one of the things about a with what's his face from narcos? Pablo Escobar last. He got like a fucking crazy. Do they all do it. Once you get like that rich, you're like, just get some animals, animals, animals. So people in with the Lions and tigers. Real common thing that is super rich. People getting shit. Jacqueline huddlestone. That's right. Michael Jackson. Language accent. Everything. Yeah. They had like a zoo in his backyard. He had weird shit. Like weird birds. Yeah. I don't think it may be at a monkey or something. He did have weird shit. Nothing dangerous day before the playboy mansion. This is at the end of his career. That was like whoa. The thing years ago thumping and it was pretty awesome.
