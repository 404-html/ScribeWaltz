Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Go see a boxing match. He doesn't even want that to be the three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       We live. Are we live? Yeah. We were just talking about a sober October and a red sphere and the speculation that he may be in fact a doing, running some shenanigans. We do not know.

Speaker 1:          00:00:20       It seems to be shenanigans at play here, but he's. He went to strong the first day. I know still. I don't believe that you could sustain that amount of that heart rate for that.

Speaker 2:          00:00:29       It's interesting to look at his graph because he was at 80 plus percent of his max heart rate for more than an hour and 20 minutes. Which a look, he might just be trying to kill himself. He's got a strong will.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       Yes. I know. Shifty. She hung. Is He shifty and honest because he'll eventually come out with this is what I did and of course I did that. You guys knew I was doing it the whole time. That's what he'll say. Oh, come on. Yeah, of course. Of course. I was going to do that. So yeah. But he is shifty and like he, he, he, he's a prankster, he's a prankster, he's definitely going to do some weird stuff to get ahead in this. But he also knows he's gonna lose to

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       legion of skanks, no shit in a box and brought it onto the stage and he had it like sealed up and then open it in front of everybody. And apparently the smile was so horrendous. People were bail you out of the room. He's gagging and throwing up. It's like a public health hazard. You're not supposed to like have shit human shit in public.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       He's so weird. Fast. And Elisa was gangs. They've seen everything for them to be running out of the room. Yeah, they've done everything and seeing everything in red still freaked them out. I can't believe that. I just now heard that story like that should be like a headline that's shit in a box and brought it into a room where the live podcast was taking place. It was a small room to room with a hundred people in it. I love it. I love someone who is not scared to talk about shit and deal with shit. Just

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       no, he's not scared of that. I mean, look, the fact that he entered into this contest at all and it doesn't work out at all for 10 years, and then he's like, there's a fitness contest and the loser has to do something. We haven't totally determined what the loser has to do or he wants us to like drink each other's piss.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       He wants to drink. Your pis are lifted. He might not lose right now. Tom Seger is in the bottom. Thompson goes at the bottom. I think tom is gonna try. I think. I mean your obviously set to witness thing, but I think Tom's going sneak up. He's playing it down. You looked at his wrist yesterday. You Go, what's the thousand something? Oh, that's nothing. Just the calories you burned that day. A thousand. Tom's Tom Sneaky. A lot of people feel like that. I really think he's gonna. He's gonna do something on this. He's going to be the one to beat.

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       You got to realize though, Bert ran a marathon. He did run a marathon.

Speaker 1:          00:03:03       He's got this. This is fun. I have to say any one of you could pull ahead, but you're the. I mean, can we talk about what you did yesterday?

Speaker 2:          00:03:12       Yeah. I worked out for three hours and 20 minutes. I'm trying to. I'm trying to double marathon. Yeah. I'm trying to break burt's will. That's what I'm really trying to do. Talks on this Mickey Mantle Gene Shit. I'm like, motherfucker, I'm crazy. You don't understand. I will work out twice a day like that. I will. I'll try to give you a fucking heart attack. You Fat. Fuck. I would love to see you will too. He'll, you'll kill him. You couldn't kill it. Don't know if he's going to. I don't know how long he's going to keep it up because like birds, very competitive up to a point like the. With the weight loss challenge. Tom Stayed steady and Tom one in the end in one bit per tried. He tried to sprint towards the end but it was too little too late and Thomas talking shit the entire time. Like, I know what you're gonna do. You're gonna fuck off until the very end. Then you get to try to catch up, but it's going to be too late. And he was right.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       Yup. Yeah. Bert, I don't know if birds will, can be broken, hasn't been broken before.

Speaker 2:          00:04:08       Uh, well it's not as will. It's the discipline aspect. See, when you're dealing with an entire month, you have 31 days of having to get after it. So how often do you get after it normally? See, that's the thing. Yeah. The difference between me and Bert is I work out almost every day already. So for me it's just like those days off don't exist anymore. So what I've decided to do on my days off, it's just do shit that I wouldn't normally do. So I'll do the elliptical machine for two hours or I'll do something else or just I'll do something else, but the whole time I'm thinking I'm going to break. I'm gonna break. Fuck your Mickey Mantle Gene.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       Yeah. You guys were talking about like who you think about when you're really trying to get past that point where you're either your kickboxing or even on an elliptical, sometimes you've got to get angry and you think of Bert right now

Speaker 2:          00:05:01       talking about right now I'm thinking of Bert, thinking of her breaking bird breaking as well.

Speaker 1:          00:05:06       I don't understand. You guys are all addicts in different ways and this is so interesting to watch because you're right. You already work out a lot. You're an extremely healthy guy, but you're now going to take it. Your Ex. I can see the excitement on all of you to take this to just an excruciating level because it. It gets obsessive and it gets fun. Like you can work, but that's the thing I'm excited to talk to you at the beginning of this when you're still pumped up about it and it's like you get a high from working out for three and half hours a day.

Speaker 2:          00:05:38       Seventeen days from now I'm going to be a beaten man. Yeah, you are,

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       and you're going to get a surge at the end when it gets close again, but 17 days. You're right. That's not going to be a fun day for you. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       yeah. Well, I don't know. Who knows, you know, did she ever see. There's a really interesting documentary with Eddie Izzard. Eddie Izzard, who is not a guy, and really good. Should you see it? I didn't it, but I know what he's done.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       I love that guy. He's so impressive. He's amazing. What he did was he ran around Europe. He did a marathon a day with no training. I mean, no training. He wasn't, he wasn't in shape. He was overweight, his feet weren't prepared, his feet got destroyed and I watched this in the beginning. I watched us like, how is he going to do this? And then towards the end I was like, wow, this guy is a force of will. Just sheer will. I mean his lifestyle is not that he's exercising consistently and this is just, he's just going to do a little bit more and really push himself hard. No, no exercise, just like, I don't think he exercised at all or if he did it was just, he just had a normal body, you know, it didn't have a body of, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       somebody's looking at me go a marathon a day. Anyone could do that. But it's, it's so mental, mental. Yeah. And I think I think a lot of comedians have that. Maybe I'm just doing the thing what comedians do of patting themselves on the back for being more interesting than other people. Like we do all the time. Like we're so much more broken and we have more willpower, but I think that there's. I get obsessed with exercise too and I really get into it and I kind of. I remember Louis C k doing some interview where he said that he runs five miles a day because on that fourth mile when he doesn't want to do the fifth, he thinks about like a day where he'll be on set and want to just call it a day and not push through and it's like how it all relates. Or you'll be in the middle of an hour set and you'll be tired and you just. Everything can relate to being on set or in the middle of a set and that run five miles a day. Making yourself do that means you can get through anything. And so I run a lot and I have, I think of it the same way. It's just endurance to perform for an hour every night. Think that's insane that we do that.

Speaker 3:          00:07:46       Well. If you have more energy, definitely can put out more during the show. So if you are in better shape, you have more cardio, you won't get exhausted, you'll be able to put out more energy, you'll be more vibrant, more robust, you know, you, you really kind of. I mean in some ways if you're doing like an hour a night, especially if you're doing two shows a night, right? You owe it to yourself to have an energy reserve.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       Yeah. Yeah. It's just the. I just think that running, running so monotonous, and there's so many times where you could go, I could just not do this and I can just start walking and who cares? But something about pushing yourself through a run when you could give up and always you never regret it. I'll say that you never regret keeping running when you could just walk

Speaker 3:          00:08:34       a moving meditation and a lot of ways you're. You're forcing your mind to take control of your body and you're forcing your mind to ignore all of the aches and pains and all the, the desire to quit. That's when people say that run marathons. You know that you just have to. Like my friend John Joseph says it best. He said, you got to tell you your mind as to tell your body who the

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       fuck the bosses

Speaker 1:          00:08:57       God it is. I just did dancing with the stars. Holy Shit. I just got eliminated last week. That's a lot of work. It was so physically exhausting for. It was a month of my life every day for hours a day dancing. And I've never danced before. And um, but it was, I didn't realize how mental it all really is, like athletics is, it's so mental. I didn't realize it because I've never been an athlete my whole life. But before I got into this competition I was like reading all the books about like why I am where I am physically that's not going to change. So I better figure out a way to mentally overcome some stuff and I was able to. But man, it is, it's all that I, I feel like a lot of times and it broke me in many ways mentally and physically. But it was, I mean it was my sober October for sure. It was my, you working on every single day and giving it, trying to beat Bert.

Speaker 2:          00:09:55       It's definitely not easy. There's nothing, there's nothing. I did a bunch of dancing lessons for a movie that I was in called zookeeper with Kevin James Way back in the day. And I had to learn how to dance. And then I had to learn how to dance with Leslie Bibb from Talladega Nights. She, my ex girlfriend and was trying to win back from Kevin in the movie, so I had to learn how to, like there was a scene where we dance in this ballroom and uh, you know, if you realize how difficult it is for ours, we're practicing these moves and it's fucking monotonous. And here's the thing, I don't give a fuck about dancing. So it's something like I had to force myself to do that I didn't really want to do. I'm just not that I don't give a fuck about other dancing's fun if you just do whatever you want, but when you're doing this very specific pattern to certain music and you did. Ugh. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       Oh yes. This is the scene, James. Gosh,

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       look at you. Yeah. We had to practice this shit over and over again for weeks and weeks. What was that? You. Yeah, it was, it was exhausting. There was a lot to it.

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       That was so stupid. It's so hard. Dancing is so hard and just like you, I. Wow. That's good.

Speaker 1:          00:11:17       I don't, I don't care about it. I, I, I don't. It's not something when I want to be good at something, I will give everything to be good at it. And here's the other thing, if you have a natural ability to begin with, if someone goes, you've got to, you kind of knack for this, you go, oh well I'm good. I'm going to keep trying. When I walked into this, I've never. No one's ever been like, you've got rhythm girl. No one's ever. No one's ever given me even the slightest nudge towards any kind of, um, playing, you know, having any musical ability or having any dance ability if anything. I've been shamed my whole life. And then they asked me to do this. Literally my whole life. I've never danced at weddings. I don't dance at concerts because I just know that I'm going to be made fun of in some way and obviously no one's even thinking about me, but in my head it's, it's my most insecure thing to do.

Speaker 1:          00:12:03       I would rather have sex on, on, on tv 100 percent. Then do dancing with the stars. If there was a sign me up, Joe. I'm serious. This was my biggest fear, but you can't turn down these things when they're offered to you. I feel like, especially if there's something that scares you that much as as this did, I was like, what do I have diluted? I'm not going to die doing this. What's the worst that could happen is I'm voted off first and they say really means to the judges say mean things about my style from. Yeah, they got mean to me. They got really means me fucking super serious. Listen, I got eliminated less than like a week ago from this show that I gave everything to and I and I went in saying I'm a terrible dancer. I don't know what I'm doing, and I did a whole dance and I didn't mess up.

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       Joe Like I and I got very injured the day before. I couldn't even move. I couldn't get out of bed. I had to have help because I tore something in my back and I overcame, came at mentally. I talked myself out of having an injury mentally, like I meditated my way out of it, which I've done with several different injuries in my life of just like I, I, I got to be better. I have to dance on live TV tonight and I couldn't move. I couldn't brush my hair because my arm was hurting so bad that morning, so I just started saying to myself, you're strong, you're prepared and this is easy. You're strong, you're prepared. The ZZ, and I sent it 3000 times out loud in the makeup chair all day, walking around, slowly going from this kind of injury, walking like in the morning to, okay, I'm strong, I'm prepared, this is easy.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       And then I. Then at the end of the day I was, I danced on live TV and I cured myself mentally. It was insane, but they were so mean to me. Especially len goodman, the British, old Cranky Judge Frisch guy. The British guys always assholes. It was, it was really hurtful and I took it in stride, but I was very. He called me awkward. Like I, I just wanted to walk away from this show, not being like a white girl dancing meme, you know, like I just didn't want people to be like, Oh, white girls can't dance because I know I can't dance in and I just didn't want to be made fun of. And he made fun of me. He was like, you look awkward because at the end of it I just go, I can dance. Like it was just me being funny because I obviously can't. But I was like, I just completed a dance that if you walk, it's not that terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       I was very injured that morning. I was proud of myself and he goes, you will awkward and you can't dance, you can't dance. And then he, he said other things that I just, I kind of blacked out during it because it was so sad and I was just holding onto Tom Bergeron for dear life. And um, and then I got eliminated first. So it's so funny to me because I took on this challenge being like the worst that could happen is that I get eliminated first, which I surely won't do because that's, I can't be that bad. I'll be better than somebody, somebody 13 of 13 people and I wasn't, I was the worst. My worst fear did happen. I got made fun of on TV. I got eliminated first and you know, like being on a reality show, like have you done a reality show where it's like and the next to the first, the first contestant eliminated from the show and then there's dinner and there's a spotlight on you and I'm staring at the stage, like just a slat in the stage.

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       I'm just staring there being like they're going to say Nikki and gloves, they're going to say Nikki and Globe and they Nikki and Gla. And it was just like, I'm on a reality show right now. Getting eliminated. It was so surreal and it sucked. It sucked. And I'm still obviously very much feeling it. And I loved the show. I wanted to like, keep going. I wanted to do different dances. I like was ready to really because I just learned how to learn how to dance, so I had to learn how to learn how to because I'd never danced before in my life, never learned the mark arena like I was. I took myself out of any kind of dancing that was offered to me in school because I was just like, I'm a bad dancer. I don't want. I wanted to make fun of me. I'll never dance and I sign up for the show. I learn a dance. I nail it as much as I can nail something. I was very proud of myself and then I get eliminated and it, it really. Obviously I'm still, I'm just.

Speaker 3:          00:16:14       Has Anybody ever done it? Two years in a row? I would love to do it. I was almost. No, but I want you start taking dancing lessons. I would love to. Why don't you do that and then come back next year and shove it up that British guys ass. I don't think they'd want me back. I bet they would. I bet they have a hard time getting people to do that show. Why did they let me go so soon then joe? Because it didn't feel like it was because of my

Speaker 1:          00:16:38       sing. It felt, you know, when you get eliminated from one of these shows that you just go, oh, they don't. Someone at the top doesn't like me. There's something else involved here. It's not okay.

Speaker 3:          00:16:53       It's probably just butt out of 13 people. They liked me the least. Well, maybe just being honest, you had the worst performance. Isn't that possible? I mean, you, you, you don't. Didn't look. If I was on with you, I probably would have had the worst performance. I don't fucking dance. Right. So it's like you think about your base that you're coming from. You're not a person who dances. This is a totally new thing for you, but if now you have this in your head and you decide to take dancing lessons and you do it on a regular basis just once, twice a week for a year, you can be fucking amazing by time next year rolls around. I really, I got to see if they allow people to enter a second, continue. They will will. Look, I, it's fucking hard to get people to do that show. A lot of people say no. A lot of people. It's a massive commitment. A lot of people don't have the courage or the time or the interest in sending twice and got the same place

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       looking good. For me, that was a different host to the same house. It was a different host, different judges because the first time I did it I was in college and I liked. There was no reason for me to even get as far as I got.

Speaker 3:          00:18:03       Let's be honest. It was rigged. What did you ever host or hostess? No, it was one of the judges and there was. There was a real issue of with one season, not with mine, but with Brett Butler, drew Carey and a couple other people. They protested because the person they voted for did not make it through because the producers decided that they knew better and because they wanted the television show to be more interesting, so they wanted someone more controversial or whatever, whatever it was. So it was this huge deal where they're like, wait a minute, why are we here as judges if you're not even counting our vote, like this is all a puppet show, like what? What's happening here? And then there was also conflict because one of the guys who was a producer was also a manager of some of the people that were on the show and people like, what the fuck? You know? There was a lot of issues. There was a lot of issues with that show.

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       Yeah. But I think that's every realities, but it's a context.

Speaker 3:          00:19:04       There's rules. Like I would tell people like that want it to be on fear factor. Like they would say, hey man, can you get me on fear factor? I'd say it stopped right now there's very specific rules about game shows. Like I can't even talk to you if you want to be on the show. I can't say, hey man, I'm going to get you on the show because I like you and I'm gonna help you. I can't do that. You can't. Even if you want to be on the show, don't talk to me because if, if I have to go to court. Do you remember that? That show quiz show?

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       Yeah, the, the, the movie was based upon that controversy,

Speaker 3:          00:19:36       fraudulent show because during that show they decided this one guy who was winning, they decided it was a great thing to have him keep winning and so they rig the show and because of that there's actual federal laws about how you organize and run game shows. It's, there's a real laws behind.

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       So then that's why I think I can't go back. I really, I love this idea. I would like to tell ABC I am interested in coming back and any of this

Speaker 3:          00:20:05       and I guarantee you you can go back.

Speaker 1:          00:20:07       I would love to go back. I had the best time. I just want to be a dancer now. Like I stopped doing comedy because I just wanted to focus solely on dancing and I started doing comedy towards the end because you do something for hours a day that you're terrible at. You want to go do something you're good at just to like get your ego back in place, because I was beaten down for hours a day of just, I'm terrible and I was able to get to a place where I could kind of have my, uh, my teacher gloves of Django is one of the best dancers in the world. He would just say like, I've never been a teacher teaching dance since he was 14 years old. And he was like, I've never met someone who is so bad at, like I've never met

Speaker 4:          00:20:47       someone who's. I go, I'm special needs dancing. Like if this were a, I would be on the short bus for dancers. I just don't have whatever it takes. But I worked hard enough that I was able to learn a very difficult to know.

Speaker 2:          00:20:59       Stop you there. It's not that you don't have what it takes as you've never exercised it. Yes. You know how to move. You're not ambulatory, you know, I don't

Speaker 4:          00:21:08       to say that I'm disabled in any way, but whatever some people are born with that gives them a natural rhythm and like ability to dance. I don't,

Speaker 2:          00:21:17       I'm coming out a little of that and a lot of it is just a bunch of dancing and they danced at all. Yeah, I mean think about it. I mean if you never played basketball and you went and played basketball, you. God Damn it. I'm terrible. I thought it was going to kick ass. Yeah. You know, that's. A lot of people feel like that about fighting. Like a lot of people think if I ever fought out, fuck people up like you. Yeah. Good luck. You think that good luck.

Speaker 4:          00:21:40       That's the thing is I wanted, I kept saying down the barrel of the camera, I'm like, if you're watching at home being like, why can't this girl do this? Because it would be like clapping that I couldn't get or walking and clapping together and I could just picture people at home watching me struggle and be like, oh, I could do that. Like I say to the computer when I watch this stuff, but I'm like, until you do it, you don't know how hard this is. It. Look, everyone assumes that they can do it just like stand up. But here's the difference with standup is like I had people just like you did throughout your childhood and growing up be like, you're funny, you've got like no one's ever been like, you should dance. Like No. What do you mean? Like we have a natural knack at what we do that's kept us, that made us even try it in the first place. Right. Who was the first person that you remember being like, you're funny.

Speaker 2:          00:22:31       Well, the, there's like one guy in specific that I'm still very good friends with. His name's Steve Graham. He's an ophthalmologist actually. And when we were, uh, we were friends, I was 15 and he was probably in his late twenties and we were training together. We're doing martial arts together and he was just, I would just do impressions of our friends and, and he was like, you should be a comedian. And I was like, get the fuck Outta here. And there's no way, man. I was like, look, I'm, I'm, I say fucked up things that you think are funny because you're fucked up too. Like regular people are gonna think I'm an asshole. Like, I just wanted to make people laugh that were around me. I didn't know. And then I started going, uh, I went to an open mic night and then I realized like, oh, there's like a whole, this is like martial arts.

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       Like there's a whole process of learning. Like I didn't think of it that way. I thought people were just really good, you know what I mean? Like, Hey, it's Jerry Seinfeld. Like when I was in high school, when I was in high was senior in high school, this girl that I was dating, we went to see Jerry Seinfeld at the paradise. It was this big club and in Boston. And I remember sitting there thinking like, this guy's incredible. He's just talking and all these people are laughing. Like this is amazing. What a, what a crazy ability to do that, you know? And just, wow, that blew me away. And then a couple of years later I was doing it. So it's weird.

Speaker 4:          00:23:49       It is. But that's, I would love to see a picture of you in that crowd that night. Never having been on stage with a mic. Like, and then look at you now. It's just so crazy. Those moments of like in your life where you were at a Jerry Seinfeld show going, Whoa, I could never do that. Joe Rogan. That's so nuts. It was weird, but now you're just like you and Jerry Seinfeld to me are like one in the car. Like that's the same, so that's, that's cool. But what I'm saying is that you need these people in your early on. You need to be. I would never have done standup comedy had someone not been like, you should be a comedian. I was desperate for anyone to give me any kind of direction. And then some one person says at one ophthalmologist says it and then it becomes your career and that's why I'm always. I always try to just tell what I'd see people like something in someone. I try to say that because you don't know if you're the one person that's going to get them to go do it.

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       I do that too. I've tried to talk like 100 people into being comedians. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What was trying to tell friends that I have that are funny, I'm like, you should just try it. Just go up at an open mic night and give it a shot. I would just say do it if you want to do it, do it now because you're going to do it eventually and you're going to regret not doing it sooner. You might not do. There was a nurse that used to work at this doctor's office or to go to. She was fucking hilarious and I was always telling him, listen to me. You should fucking do comedy. You really should try it. And she never did it, you know? And I went there for years and she thought about doing it, so I'm going to call them to open mic night.

Speaker 2:          00:25:20       I go, tell me when you're going. I'll go. I'll go, I'll meet you there. I'll, I'll help you. I'll introduce you to the whole process. I'll show you how it works. I'll show you. There's a signup. People go up. Listen, she's not meant to do it. Well, it's like, what's that expression? You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink. Yeah. It's like, I know, but just I think you have to be fucked up to want that kind of rejection and humiliation that we got in the early days. The early days too. Like people see you now. You go up in the main room. Hit Ladies and gentlemen. Nikki glaser. Yeah. Clap, clap, clap. Thank you. Goodnight. Seems like fun. Hey, that seems like a great Gig, but see you. When you're an open miker and you're around all those fucking psychopaths that are signing up for open mics. They're all smelly and and sons in Kansas City. Oh my God. I heard Craig just died recently. Know gone beetlejuice because your dog. Do you like this? Hey, you want to really work here? Come sit on Craig's lap. Uncle craigy. Yeah. That takes me right back. Dude. Started there. That was a fun Gig.

Speaker 4:          00:26:26       It was a fun gag. I used to love that place. Classic Road Gig. Just CD. Didn't know if you were going to get paid the full amount. Good shows too. Rowdy drunk. Kansas City is a fun place. It was a fun place. I was just there couple weeks ago

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       and I did some crazy outdoor place. Some outdoor amphitheater was awesome. No, that's good. No, it was really great. I didn't even know it was outdoor until we got there. It was

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       one of those gigs. Are you like I had done? No, I didn't read any of the emails about this.

Speaker 2:          00:27:00       I didn't pay attention to is me and Santina. Santina was outside. I was like, get the fuck out of here. It's not outside. What's outside? It was strange.

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       Yeah. I started in Kansas City, but that's just. I've been relating it recently. I'm like working on a bit about encouraging people early on because I do look at the people that told me you should be a comedian when I. right before I tried it because I was going to be an actress and then I was like not really good at this and I'm not. I don't care enough to get good at it. Like I see what it takes to be great at being an actress and I was just like, I don't want to do that. But then someone was like, you're funny, you should try standup. And then that was like, oh, I'm, I care enough about this to like go through the worst of it and get good. But I, I, I've been exploring recently unstaged like blow jobs. Um, I've been talking through and I think it's the same thing because I'm not great at them.

Speaker 1:          00:27:54       I've never been like, wow, you're the best at this. And I've never been a girl who's like, I love giving blow jobs. And I've always heard girls, like there's some girls that say that like, I love second deck and I've always been like, say that to you or does it say it's a guys? They say it, it just, it just out there. And I've always called bullshit on it because I just think it's like you're just serving a guy and you. There's no way that you can enjoy it. Like it's not that comfortable of a thing, but maybe you get some, uh, what's the, the compersion where you enjoy someone else's. Yes. So maybe it's that, but now I realize that the difference between me and those girls is that those girls, the first time they gave a blow job, I guarantee or one of the first times the guy was like, you're amazing at this, you're really good at this, because when a girl is told or anyone has told early on the first time they do something that like, you have a natural talent at this, you go, I, I do.

Speaker 1:          00:28:48       And then you do it again and again because you're like, I'm good at this, this is my thing. And then you get good at it and you're like, it's my thing. But no one ever said that to me about blowjobs early on. It was always just kind of like a means to an end. And I feel like if someone would have just been like, lied to me. So I am. I asked guys now like, just lie to every girl. If you get a blow job and it's like mediocre, just be like, you're the best at this ever. Like this is the best job I've ever received because she will be. So it'll make her feel good. What's it gonna hurt that she thinks she's the best at this thing that she's not that great at, but she'll do it a lot because she'll be like, I'm great at this and this guy thinks I'm the greatest at it. So she'll do it a lot and then by doing a lot she'll get better and then everyone wins.

Speaker 2:          00:29:29       Yeah, maybe. Or she could just suck a lot of dicks and people will lie to her and then her self esteem gets shattered. If she runs into the one dude and said, who the fuck told you you're good at this? Nobody told me I was great. No, no, you're not good at this at all. It's all teeth and you're choking. This is crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:29:49       Maybe maybe even a girl that is really good at them can meet a guy that's like you're tailing because everyone likes different styles. So I think that you run that risk regardless.

Speaker 2:          00:29:58       Maybe some guys just like really bad blow jobs. Right? Like some guys like blowjobs from someone who seems like they've never done it before, that way they don't feel like they're the 90th in line.

Speaker 4:          00:30:06       Oh, that's a really good point. Joe. Like you could be into a blowjob that's kind of apprehensive and like, what am I doing that. How does this feel like a virgin all type situation? Just putting on an act. It's got pigtails on I just schoolgirl outfit. What am I doing? Wait, what do you teach? What do you do with this? Oh my God, my friend recently, because we've talked a lot about, me and my friend have talked a lot about how we are insecure that we're bad at blowjobs and we've taken classes at bay bland or all these things are way. Way, way, way, way, way, way way wait, wait, wait, wait. They tip, they give out classes to give blowjobs. Who's teaching the class as girls or guys? Uh, I think it was like a gay guy and a woman together. Jay Guy, gay guy should know how to suck a dick because he has one.

Speaker 4:          00:30:49       I've read everything. I've watched tutorials. I just, it's just not getting through to me. I just, I haven't, I try and I'm not like bad at that. Like I, I don't think I'm, I'm bad at them, but I just, I think I always was apprehensive because I think the first thing I heard about blow jobs was that the first complaint I would hear around me was too much teeth and I've always had like really big teeth in some like smile. I have vague teeth that abnormal, but I always just like, I had buck teeth as a kid so I was always called me like a beaver. I was like, my teeth are going to get in the, in the way of this, so I immediately. That was my biggest issue. And then you learn that like that's easy to like work around and then so anyway.

Speaker 4:          00:31:29       But my friend said that she learned this new trick where she wouldn't, she's hooking up, she'll do a role play of like will you teach me how to do a blow job? But she's actually wanting them to teach her and so it's a hot thing where like she gets to role play. But she honestly doesn't know and gets and then the guy tells her exactly what to do and then if she messes up, it's like part of the character as opposed to her being bad at blow jobs. So that's my next thing. I'm going to try thing. So the guys invested in the project. Yeah. And if you mess up your own, you're just part of your character. You're just being good at the roleplay. It's because you're innately better.

Speaker 2:          00:32:04       But then when you break up, you're like, listen asshole, I sucked 100 Dick before you. I know exactly what I was doing. I was trying to make you feel better. You fucking loser. But either way they were all bigger than yours. All of.

Speaker 4:          00:32:15       Exactly. Yeah. It's um, yeah. I, I don't know, I have a lot of thoughts about sex. Obviously I'm, well your act is very much like that. It is, but it's, and I hate being pegged, no pun intended as like a sex comic, but like, cause I just did this ABC show dancing with the stars and the whole time I'm trying to be on my very best behavior. I, I want

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       to play the game, I don't want to be the sex girl. Get kicked off in the first episode. I don't want to offend children watching at home. That's. I've never talked about sex. So people go, Ooh, she's, you do nightclub comedy, you're there for adults. I'm just talking about what I want to talk about. Obviously what we all know that, but I think sometimes people are like year the sex coming because like I just think that's the most interesting topic right now. That's why I'm talking about it becomes a problem, right? You get labeled. Yeah. It sucks because I have ambitions beyond being a comedian who talks about sex, but already I brought it there with you because it is my wheelhouse. I'm most comfortable talking about it. It's fun to talk about. I have a lot of opinions about it. I was trying to behave myself so much on dancing with the stars because I don't want to be labeled as that.

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       But. And I also was like, didn't have sex. I was 21. I, yeah, I was not. And then I didn't because I was all through high school, I was just like scared of guys. I don't know why I was just scared of intimacy, scared of boys, couldn't, didn't kiss a boy until I was 17 and even then it was like one shot deal and then I didn't do it for years. And then I got an eating disorder which like push men away because I looked like a skeleton and then as soon as I was able than I, I had sex. But it was years and years and until I started like drinking, I couldn't have sex. And then I quit drinking and I couldn't have sex again. Thinking about how many

Speaker 2:          00:34:06       the people have gotten laid because of booze. Every one dming Joe, do you remember when there was this ridiculous time just a few years ago where they were trying to push this narrative that if you have sex with someone who's been drinking, that you're a rapist even if you're drinking to this is this weird third wave feminist nonsense where they were like adults going to grown adults have a couple of drinks. You're not supposed to do that because they can't consent because they're drinking and so people were literally calling people and accusing people of rape because they had sex with each other while they were both drunk. No. Well, this was a. well, here's it was a real weird time and they've abandoned it because it's so preposterous and the pushback was so hard, but you're responsible for yourself every other time when you're drunk, if you're driving, you're responsible. If you get in a fight, you're responsible, you're responsible during all those things, but somehow or another if you and a person or exchanging pleasure, then you are not responsible for your actions and you can't consent to that because you've been drinking and then it becomes rape and it's only really only rape. In the case of the guy, it's never raped a girl rape the guy because the guy was drunk.

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       Right. Even though I know stories of where that's happened, where a guy wakes up from a blackout and a girl is stuck in this deck. Yeah. Yeah. And that's. And he's like, Hey, do I know if it was the other way around? Right, right, right. Yeah. Um, yeah. But obviously it's not the same. No. And no one would be having sex if we didn't, if we didn't have alcoholic few people.

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       So few people because 30 percent of the people having sex, think about casual sex. That's my whole point right now is like I can't have, I'm single. I can't even have casual sex because I'm sober. So how long have you been sober? Seven. It'll be seven years in December. From alcohol? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:35:54       Yeah. And before then I was hooking up a left and right. It was so fun. I was blacking out just to have sex because I was scared of intimacy. I'm realizing all of this now is like,

Speaker 5:          00:36:05       I know the whole deal. You're doing all that.

Speaker 4:          00:36:07       Yeah, I go through therapy. I work on myself constantly. I meditate, I do all the things and I'm, I, I don't know if I'm any. I am better for it, but I realized that I'm not getting, I'm not having sex and it's not fun like I am. I'm hooking up with ex boyfriends, which you know, that's because there's no pressure there of like, this is new and am I going to catch feelings? It's like they've already been had or the or the bubble up again. You just get to scratch an itch. Yes, yes. But, but having new sex casually, like I just can't. I can't even imagine doing that. But I had so much when I drank because it just makes everything easier and I used to just. And I asked the crowd sometimes. I'm like, have you guys ever. Who here has had sex for the first time with someone? We're. Both of you were stone cold sober first time sex. Literally two people raised their hand and in the main room and go

Speaker 5:          00:37:01       of the story. No, exactly. No, you're so right. No one listening at home right now. Wherever you are. Have you ever had sex for the first time with someone where you're both sober? It doesn't happen in our society. Well, alcohol gets abused for sure, but it also gets used, used correctly. There's good things to alc. I think it's a technology that alleviates a lot of your inhibitions and it makes people feel better and that's it for that reason. You. Are you an addict? I mean, is it possible that you could drink a little bit? I'd be fine drinking a little bit. I know I would first thing you say before you wake up in the gutter, exactly

Speaker 4:          00:37:42       how I am with weed and I have to, I start out and I go, I'll just get high as a treat, you know, after a set and then I go, that'd be fun to be high for the set and then it's like it'd be fun to be high when I wake up in the morning. And so it always, it always snowballs into I'm high all day and then I have to go. Okay. Sober October and I quit for a month and then build it back up again.

Speaker 5:          00:38:04       Is that what you're doing right now with. We'd, like you say you're sober, sober with alcohol, but

Speaker 4:          00:38:08       I smoke a little weed and I've gone years in the seven years of not smoking weed and um, but I'm back on it. I quit for dancing with the stars because my short term memory

Speaker 5:          00:38:17       was shit and you can't learn dance steps when you're high. I thought I might like help me, but no, I think if you already knew it, if you had it locked in your memory then it would be good because you'd feel it more.

Speaker 4:          00:38:30       Yes, but it was terrible for me. So I quit for three weeks and the second I got eliminated I started again and have. So it's been a week of me smoking weed again and it's already like it's, you know, the snowball effect is in, is in play, but we does not derail my work ethic. It makes me work out more. It makes me think in a different creative way and it eventually impedes me when it starts to interfere with my voice. If I start getting like horse more because I'm doing radio every morning and then I'm going to make you hoarse. Yeah. Because I just like, I don't know how to inhale or something. I just want you use edibles. I do, but those aren't. I liked like, I like to feel it in my lungs and feel it immediately. If there was an immediate edible I'd do it.

Speaker 4:          00:39:20       But um, I like those too. But again, those fuck up my voice too. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Yeah. But um, yeah, I so wish. But with alcohol I will say like I just could see it snowballing into a point where I would quit again, but I just have never. I miss drinking a lot for the sex thing, for the dancing thing. Like just dancing to music in general. Like is more fun. Like if you drunk just life, like first who drinks, like life is pretty great for drinks, good. Sending text messages. I don't want to send reaching out to guys they don't want to talk to in the morning. All of that anxiety. The hangover. That's what I'm avoiding is the hangover and with we need. I don't have a hangover. You can hang from weed. No. No, but for sure. And does it make you want to quit and question everything? I mean, how do you keep your drinking in check?

Speaker 3:          00:40:16       Um, I've never had a problem with drinking in like, it's never been like, God, I need a drink. I've never been like, like, like sober. October was the first time I did absolutely nothing for a whole month. I didn't smoke a joint, I didn't do mushrooms, I didn't, nothing, right? Wasn't that hard. What was interesting about it was the dreams, first of all, because the dreams come hard and fast when you're off the weed and they, because apparently I talked to this Guy Dr Matthew Walker, who is a dream specialist and he was on the podcast discussing the importance of sleep sleep specialist, I should say, but he was saying that marijuana impede certain aspects of rem sleep, which is when you do all your dreaming. So when you, um, get off the marijuana, your brain apparently makes up for lost time and hits you with some crazy fucking dream talking frogs and fucking Unicorns and roller coasters that go straight to heaven and fucking bananas dreams or my gut.

Speaker 3:          00:41:23       Well, the thing is this time for a sober October, I was way tapered off by the time this rolled around. Like I a little pot in Toronto on Saturday, but I mean a little like I took like one or two hits. I had a drink, maybe two drinks. I think I had one drink when I went on stage and then I had a couple glasses of wine after the show who went out to this restaurant after the show. But yeah, it was. This was an easy one because I was kind of. But I, I think I slowed down after last year. I think doing that a sober October thing made me realize like, hmm, there's some, there's some of that school that right. Unfortunately that is all my favorite comics did drugs. All of them picks Kennison prior. Everyone did drugs. They were, they were all.

Speaker 3:          00:42:18       I mean prior was coke. I've never touched coke but Kennison was coke too, but Hicks was more psychedelics and I mean he did coke and alcohol and all that other stuff before, but there was, there was all. They were all like these wild fucks. Like Ron White is a good friend of mine, always drunk and there's like this part of that life that, you know, there's so it's so attractive because it's just like this wild, loose, carefree, rebellious, figured out tomorrow life and that's, that's the life of the comic. But I realized like after last year, so by October that there's a lot of that stuff you could do if you're sober and, and it's, I think as I said, you can abuse alcohol, but you can also use it, you know, you can use it, you can, you can have a couple drinks and feel good and you enjoy the moment more.

Speaker 3:          00:43:07       You know, there's, there's something, there's something to it, but it's really a matter of your own personality and discipline. It's like how much and how much of an addict are you? Like what, how much, what is it, what holes are missing in your brain that get filled up with that booze and that like once you take the booze away, there's this gaping chasm that you need to fill in. What is that? And you got to figure out who you are. Because I know some people that can't have anything, they have one drink and then they're off to the races and they're doing math.

Speaker 1:          00:43:40       Yeah. No, that's not me, but it's, I just, I, I would get blackout drunk a lot and well after a couple beers,

Speaker 3:          00:43:51       like were you less secure then the newer now?

Speaker 1:          00:43:56       Yeah, way, way less secure, but I think being sober has helped me become more secure. But because you're forced to be in the moment, I just, I worry about my depression too, like with adding booze on to depression, which I feel like I have a good handle of right now. I just don't want to lose it because I think that like, I don't know, obviously alcohol is a depressant and so I think that and, and the people that I, I, I, I get really, really depressed and like in a dangerous way where I'm like, I gotta watch it. Like I got to be vigilant about meditating every day to keep my depression at bay because

Speaker 2:          00:44:34       what do you think that is? Do you think that's a genetic thing? Do you think it runs in your family?

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       I think it must run in my family. I think we have stuff that I haven't even like get found out, but like there's some suspicious deaths in my family that I'm like, was that suicide? You know, where I'm like, I think it's described.

Speaker 2:          00:44:52       Feels like, what does your depression feeling?

Speaker 1:          00:44:54       It feels like it. Honestly. I get suicidal thoughts. Not like I just, I should kill myself. It's like kill yourself. It would be fun to kill yourself. They come from literally soothing. It soothes me to think about killing myself when I'm in my worst depressive stages. And it is, I compare it to like sniffles when you're getting a cold, like I have a little, a little thought will go, oh, shoot yourself in the head. Like it literally comes into my head like a sniffle where you're like, Oh God, I'm getting sick again. Okay, I got to meditate now and then it'll. And then I'll be fine. Like literally it's like that. And what is, what's before the shoot yourself. Nothing. Nothing. And that's the, that's the problem is like, it just is, you know, it can be, it can be. Um, it may be, it's circumstantial little bit like maybe I'm feeling lonely that day or I didn't get a thing that I wanted or I, but I really do think it's like the weather, like I just can't even describe it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:01       I remember Sarah Solomon talking about her depression. Like it's just a cloud comes over you and you're just like, oh, well here it comes. And that's kind of how it feels. And I totally have it under control when I'm meditating everyday doesn't, I don't get a single one of those thoughts. But like if I skip a day, if I don't do tm one day, those thoughts keep, they come in and then if I. and then you see if you get into a real bad spot, you, those thoughts start. I, and I've never even so much as made an attempt or even planned to make an attempt. Like it's never gotten to that even close to that for me. But I realized that these are the same kind of thoughts that people that end up doing this start with like there's some kind of like I, I, I'm, I'm a people who love me and care about me get so upset when I talk about this, but I think that more people struggle with these thoughts then talk about.

Speaker 1:          00:46:50       So I, I'm eager to share it because I don't think I'm ever going to kill myself and I don't think that that's. But I think that like a lot of people, I'm at risk and I don't think that people talk about that enough then because I do have these thoughts and I go, it's not even like I go, what can I do to make myself feel bad? Oh, I could kill myself. And literally it's like kill yourself. It's like a little voice or something. And I've struggled with mental illness before. I mean I had anorexia where it was like, don't eat. And you're like, where's that? Who's that? But it's, it's a voice. Did you have,

Speaker 2:          00:47:20       don't eat because you thought you were overweight or don't eat because you thought you'd be more attractive. If he looks like

Speaker 1:          00:47:26       all, I'm a rail, I mean this vague direction vague or was it just like an obsession? It was, it started out like, you know, um, high school, I should be skinny. Everyone should be skinny. I admire, I like wanted to be famous someday and I looked at, I admire like I idolize everyone in the magazines, the whole classic thing of like looking literally in magazines and I want to look like that. I hate myself pinching my sides being like, if I'm not like that then I'm worthless. Having a mom who constantly hated her body was skinnier than me and constantly said she was fat and things like that where you just, you have things modeled for you. So I grew up thinking skinny equals more lovable and then I lost weight just because, um, my senior year I lost weight because of boy liked me that I liked who I liked back and I was like very nervous about it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       Like, you know, when you just get nervous so you can't, you don't eat that day. And I had a date with this guy was my first date ever. And I just, that day I didn't eat because I was just nervous and then the next day it showed up on me because someone goes, you look great, what's going on? And I was like, oh, I just didn't eat yesterday. Like I can do that again. So it's basically the same thing as saying, you're really funny. You're open to suggestion. I'm really good dude. I know I, I'm scared of it. The thing is I, I am open to suggestion, but the thing is I am good at, at losing weight. I can, I can stick to a diet and I can black and white things. I can say I'm not drinking for seven. I can, I can quit things, I can quit eating and I have good.

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       It's like willpower. And I learned that like Oh for the first time, like I could do this. And so I just stopped eating. And then the for a while you get like super hot. Like I was very popular for a couple of weeks. And then for a hot second, I was hot for a second and then I got so scary skinny and then I couldn't stop your. You were just like, I go, well I don't. Everyone's like, hey you looked great like a week ago. Like right now it's kind of of concern. And I'm like, well I don't know what to do because if I eat I'll just get fat again. And so I just, this is all I know now. And then it becomes if you eat your week and then it becomes obsessive compulsive and then it's not even about being fun anymore because you look in the mirror and I would look in the mirror and go like, you're disgusting.

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       Like I looked like I w I look like Holocaust pictures. Like that's how bad I looked at photos from back then to make sure that you don't ever get back to that spot again. I won't ever get back to that spot again because I'm too vain to do that now. And I know like what I see it coming. It's the same way of like pot when I see it starting to interfere with my life, I go, okay, you need to stop drinking and smoking pot. And when I see myself get too skinny now I'm like, okay, you need to stop working in chaos, but you kind of have a handle on it. Oh, I totally have a handle on it. I won't ever be anorexic or die of depression. Like all these things I won't, like, I'll go a different way. But like those things aren't going to get me because they almost got me before.

Speaker 1:          00:50:19       I mean anorexia. I should have died. I was going to die from it. And I planned on dying from it and planned on time from. Because Joe, I was starving. It sucks to be starving and on doing this because I wanted to die. I was like, some, it was a slow suicide. Uh, 18, 18, 19, 20, 21. I was like, I stopped weighing myself because it was so dangerous to get attached to a number. But the last time I remember wearing myself I was 98 pounds. That was when I was admitted to a psych ward when I was 18 and

Speaker 2:          00:50:55       I'm five nine. And what do you weigh now?

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       I'm 1:35 now and I'm skinny now.

Speaker 2:          00:51:00       So yeah, you're not, you're not stretching imagination like 35 pounds lighter than this plus more crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       I was so thin. I was so like, that's crazy. Everywhere I went people would point and whisper and talk. It was one of those things where it was like, you know, you've seen girls out and about like that.

Speaker 2:          00:51:22       Do those to go to my yoga class. That was terrifying. She was so scary. She looked like. I mean she was a small person too. She was only like five, one or five to and she looked like she probably weighed 80 pounds. It was awful.

Speaker 1:          00:51:36       It's, that's the way people. And I see girls like that now and I, I do the same thing that people used to say to me, which is like just eat a sandwich bitch. Like what are you doing with Kim? I know you can't say that, but I don't even relate to the person I was when I wasn't eating because the only way you can say is like, I could not eat, I could not do. It was almost like if you were to like, if a protein shake, it was like drinking poison. Like I'm gonna die if I drink this. It was that hard to, to eat. I don't get. I, first of all, I was admitted to a hospital because I was going away to school. Um, I lost all this weight and like a couple months, like it went away quickly for me and it got scary fast.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       The school called my parents. My parents were in denial because they didn't want to believe that their daughter was like dying. So they were kind. They were concerned. But like I was lying to them about, oh, I'm going out to eat. I'm not going to be here for dinner night. Just lying, lying, lying. I went to the doctor to get a physical because I was going away to school in the fall. This was July. I went to go get a physical and my pulse. I have like a low pulse anyway, like I Brady Cardia. It's I think it's 37 to 42 resting. You have an issue. What is it called? It's called Brady Cardia. It's just like a low resting pulse rate. I don't know. An exercise? No. I exercise a lot, but even when I don't exercise a lot, I still just have a low. Do you do a lot of cardio?

Speaker 1:          00:52:58       I do a lot of cardio now. Yeah, but I really liked this elite athlete. Resting heart rate's like Lance Armstrong. I'm really proud of it, but I do nothing to support it. Like I run every day but not like enough to boast that, but it saved my life because I didn't know I had a low pulse rate, but when I went in for this thing that this physical, the doctor clearly could see I was anorexic because they looked at me and weighed me, but they didn't have any kind of data to keep me, but until they took my pulse and they were like, if you leave you're going to die and you're going to be a liability to us because we know so you can't leave. You're going to owe you a 50 1:50 or whatever it is where you're committed to a second one. So I went in for a checkup, was taken on a golf cart, the golf cart to the other side of the hospital where I was checked into a psych ward.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       And my mom's like, no, she's not in there. Like, yes she is. And so I was admitted there and I had to stay there for a couple of weeks I think. And then I lied to get out of it because I ate just enough to get out. And then I went to school, I convinced my parents I was okay to go away to school, which I wasn't nearly died. They're just starving myself and exercising too much and that. But that, that is how I got out of it was that so I wanted to die because I was hungry all the time. Being hungry socks and I couldn't eat. I didn't know how to eat. I didn't know even know how to begin to eat. So I was like, every night I would just pray that I wouldn't wake up because I would go to bed freezing cold because you have no fat so you're cold.

Speaker 1:          00:54:28       You have to wake up. I was going to school in Colorado. I was ill prepared for the weather and also I had no fat on my buddy was. It was an awful existence. And then I did stand up comedy for the first time because yeah, because when I went to school my freshman year, I was so crazy looking like I was. I was like, I was like the nightmare before Christmas. Jack skeletal. Yet that is what it looks like. I was. I look at pictures, I'm like, how did you have friends, bitch, but I did because I became really funny because I wanted people to go look over here, don't look at me, so I just, I was a shy kid in high school when I was not anorexic, but then when I needed to make friends because I was one school loan, I was like, oh, I'll just develop this really over the top personality so people don't notice that I'm so thin.

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       So that's when I became funny. Really funny, you know, I was always like, dormantly funny, but that's when it became like outwardly funny. People started telling me how it should be a comedian. My freshman year I tried it, I did it one time and then I was like, oh, I have a reason to live now. Like I have a purpose and I know that sounds so stupid, like cliche to say like, oh, gave me comedy. Gave me a reason to live, but it really did because I didn't know what that. I was like, what am I going to become a teacher? I don't care. I'm not passionate about that, but this, I was like, okay. So then I was like, I got, I have to gain some weight if I'm going to now have a career. So then I started, I found a therapist. I was like, I got to beat this.

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       I started reading books. I found a therapist and I found this one therapist who told me the thing that really broke through, which was like, when you have anorexia, everyone's just eat something. Why aren't you eat something? And you feel very in control of it and you feel like you're the one to blame for it because you're the one that's choosing not to eat and you're the one that's choosing to exercise. And, and um, and so I felt all this shame about like, why can't I cured myself? Why am I giving myself this thing that's ruining my life? And then this therapist was like, think of it as like cancer. Like you got, you got sick, like something invaded your life and there is a demon inside you telling you don't eat and it's not you. It's not you. So don't listen to that voice.

Speaker 1:          00:56:29       And then as soon as I was able to like, disassociate my illness from like, it's my choice, it's my doing, I'm not eating. And I was able to see it as like the exorcist, like that little girl has like a demon inside insider. That's like dominique pitch, eat if you eat your week. As soon as I was able to go shut up voice, then I was able to eat again. It was like one nugget of one way of perceiving my illness that was able for me to like crack it. And then it took many years to like. And I still struggle with controlling issues over food, but I'll never be anorexic again. But yeah, it was that, it was um, it was a mixture of comedy and also therapy that

Speaker 3:          00:57:12       with alcoholics too, that that's one of the reasons why alcoholics, when they talk about, they talk about it, like it's a disease and people who aren't alcoholics who are judgmental global. It's not a fucking disease. Cancer's a disease. Leukemia disease, you'd as weak. But if they treat it like it's a disease, then you can cure it. But if you, if you treat it like your week, then you just shit on yourself. Like, oh, I'm weak. I just want another drink. Like what is it about me? Why do I need this booze? And there's this weird cycle, this loop, this that goes on in your brain, you know, like, I don't want to drink. I don't want to drag. Dammit. I drank. I'm never gonna drink again. Fuck, I'm drinking again. And then these people that just get completely out of control. One of the ways that helps them is to treat it like it's disease.

Speaker 1:          00:57:57       Yeah. I think it's, I think it was just a real, a way that I'd never seen. I had seen so many doctors, but until that one guy told me to think of it in like literally did the thing where he put a chair in the corner of the room and was like, talk to your disease, tell it what it's done to your life. And I had to. And I go, this is too. I'm not doing this. Fuck. It took me 30 seconds until I was sobbing, screaming at this empty chair. But it, I mean it works. Have you ever talked about this on stage? No, it's so weird because I'm still, I feel like I'm still too in it or I don't know. I don't know. I want to be able to someday and when I am able to, it'll be like a real huge moment in my career in life. But even me being able to talk about it on podcasts like this or in platforms like this is new to me still and I've done it before, but it's, it's, I just feel like I still suffer with so many of these things that I'm like, oh, it's so weird to talk about it. Like I, I like to have a little bit more distance from the. Even though it's been. I'm 34 now and I get had anorexia when I was 18. I'm still like, it's still too new, but sometimes things

Speaker 3:          00:59:09       16 years seemed like a long time, you know? But it goes by quick happens very quick. It's, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:17       I just like to have. I don't know. I know what it is. I'm just still. I think I'm still so angry about it. And still, there's still pieces of it that I'm like, how did I get this and how did I have to save myself instead of someone else coming in and saving me? And why didn't someone intervene before?

Speaker 3:          00:59:38       Can't though, can they? I mean now it's kind of, it's very hard for someone to convince someone you need to stop drinking or you need to get your shit together, you need to do this, we need to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:59:48       You need to hit your own bottom. I know. And, but you know, I feel like yeah, you just, I, there's still things about it that are really painful to me. And I think that it, when I am dealing with something like that on stage, I think the pain still shows and I can't be funny with it yet because I'm still so angry. I think I'm still just like angry about it because I also feel like I'm still a victim to um, body dysmorphia, like crazy. Like that's my new thing where like, I'll just see something in the mirror. Then I'm like, well, yesterday you felt the opposite. I'll go from a 24 hour timeframe from being like, you're fat, I'll look in the mirror and be like, you're fat, and then the next day I'll be like, you're too thin. And I'm like, well, those things can't be possible within 24 hours of themselves. So your crazy. Right, so that. I mean, I'm still dealing with stuff like that and I want to be on the other side of it and be able to tell girls like, you're beautiful and your body doesn't matter and it's what's up here. That counts. But I don't. I'm not there yet. So I don't know how to, to, to really talk about it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:57       Well, I don't think. I don't think there's one way, you know, I think everybody's got their own weird thing that's causing them to have issues, whether it's a B to b, an alcoholic, or to be addicted to whatever. You're addicted to everybody. There's no one you have to figure out the person and then figure out how this disease or whatever it is a sort of interface with that person. And what is it that happened to you that made this, this thing attractive where it fits into your slots and, and, and distracts you from all the things that are freaking me the fuck out about your existence. I mean, it is a coping mechanism. If it was so simple that like, oh well then people are anorexic, you tell them this and then they go, oh, okay. I mean the. If there was like a protocol that you could just establish right away, oh you just got to take these steps and then you'll be fixed.

Speaker 3:          01:01:52       It doesn't work. And they might work for some people. You know, what would really doesn't help, you know, it doesn't help that it's so prevalent. Like there's so many people that have issues like that. And the other way too, like there's people that are bodybuilders that are crazy, that can't they, they the same gang big enough. It's the same thing. It has the same goals with giant fake boobs that they think they need triple f boobs. I like the way people see themselves versus the way other people see them as very strange. Yeah, I know what I've been watching the show botched. Have you watched that show? Yeah, I've watched that show. Holy Shit. I mean that's the same. They don't, they don't, they don't know what they don't see what we're seeing at. Oh, it's, it's crazy. This is poor lady who was on the other day who is getting, she's getting her nose fixed because she had so many surgeries that are, knows collapsed and it was just like, oh Christ, you know? And they had to take a chunk out of her rib and they rebuilt her nose up. It came out great at the end obviously. Which is why they put it on television. She fixed her. Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:02:59       Unless you don't fix inside. I don't know that bitch done done. Unless you're fixing what's up here that's making you look at yourself in the mirror and go, I'm uglier. And that's what I'm in a mad dash to do. Joe is like, fix yourself. Well, just know to yet to get to love myself enough through therapy meditation, just to love myself on the inside enough that I don't. Because as I age, as you age, especially in this business, things aren't as good for what as you age, as a woman, things get shittier, like you become less valuable to society based on the fact that you're aging. It's just funny in this business and in life. Like I remember the first time I remember one time I was hanging out in high school with my girlfriends and I remember her. This girl's mom always used to just kind of say things that she envied our youth a lot and when you're young you're just like, okay, Old Lady, what are you gonna? Get out of here. What do you do? You're saying these sad things and then just walking out of the room silently, like. But she would say these things in one day. The one thing she said really got to me, she was like, you girls are also young and thin and beautiful. You know? I remember, I remember the last time a man held the door for me and then she just left the room and I'm like, oh, there's a day that that just stops.

Speaker 3:          01:04:20       Wow, that's ridiculous. I hold them. Of course for old ladies all time, that's stupid,

Speaker 4:          01:04:24       but I, I think she meant that was the last time a man who wanted to fuck her and you know, when that's in the air when there's a door being held for you by a guy who was like, bug you, but why is that gender specific? I mean that's, that's with men with women. Men Too. I, my dad recently said to me, he was like, [inaudible] don't even look at me anymore. My Dad's like an attractive guy and he's like, I'm like invisible to women and I can see like a sadness in it and, and I don't want to. I know that that's all that will happen eventually because that is just the way things go once in a while. A guy might be, I'm an older ladies and I'd like to bang her and I will love that guy so much and I know those guys are out there and I hear hear from those guys a lot when I talk about this stuff, but those guys are sick. Just like you were when you were 18 pounds. I hope they never fixed that thickness. Please share it with the old ladies are so needy though. Thank you. So you. So

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       thank you for that is don't fix that. We need those guys. But I just know that that's, that's on the horizon, that attention from men and women and just society will start to wane and you'll become more invisible physically to other people and I just hope at that point I don't give a fuck. And then I liked myself enough and so that's what I'm. I'm like running at that. Trying to like, like myself enough on the inside, which I really have gotten so far ahead of what I thought I could ever do in terms of loving myself and working on myself and getting sober and all the things. But I still feel like it's not enough. Like I'm still, I still deal with insecurities and I'm like, God dammit, I'm aging and this. I'm supposed to not feel this. I'm supposed to not care that I'm aging as much. I don't want to be one of these women that's like a hates aging. I just don't want to be it. And I'm kind of,

Speaker 3:          01:06:11       well you have to be very careful in you feel about aging, aging. I don't think about it

Speaker 1:          01:06:17       really don't tell you don't because you seem ageless. Like honestly, someone just said your age, and I was like, I don't even think of Joe is having an age. I honestly don't like. You seem like an ageless person to me. And that's because you don't give a shit.

Speaker 3:          01:06:31       You don't think of it you this. I mean this is gonna sound ridiculous, but you have to eat. You have to realize that the entire, your life from birth to death is a blink of an eye. It is a very short period of time in terms of the entire life of the planet, the life of the human race, the life of the universe. It is a blink of an eye. And for you to be with wear blinders and concentrate on one tiny little window of sexual viability, it's preposterous. It's ridiculous because the whole, your whole existence is insane. It's so bizarre looking at people's bizarre like how the fuck do your eyes work? You're looking through your eyes and light is refracted through your lenses and your cornea and you're seeing things and I know that if I reach, I can grab. This can is right there.

Speaker 3:          01:07:24       I mean all of that is bizarre and so to to concentrate on this one thing, when will people stop wanting to stick their Dick in the me? That's crazy that I even like, but it's a crazy. It's a perspective issue, right? Yeah, and I think the, the, the wider you get away from that and one of the best ways to do that, a psychedelic drugs, psychedelic drugs are one of the very best ways to broaden your perspective because the experience is so tight, tonically, alien and so giant and connects you to the entire universe itself that when you come back down to earth, it seems so preposterous and then you see this dance that everybody's involved in, you know, with putting on fake butts and fucking get your lips done and all the chaos that people are doing just to try to attract more sexual attention and knowing that this is so, so such a short period of time. One of the things that freaked me out is what I call monster face. It's when women get their face pulled back so far that their mouth looks like it's bigger because there had been doing this and so it looks like they could just open their mouth up like venom and fucking get your whole head in there and chop your fucking head off. It's. It's a. it's a sickness.

Speaker 4:          01:08:37       It's so funny because yeah, when you get that stuff done, you end up looking like other people who have had it done so you get a certain type of face. We all know the face. You're describing like a deep sea monster, a deep sea fish.

Speaker 3:          01:08:47       Yeah. And shoot things into their cheeks and make your cheeks puff up because it eliminates some of the wrinkles. But then it looks like you've been beaten up literally like you got fucking stung with a swarm of bees. It's better. Well, it doesn't. You know also doesn't work because there's a thing called the fibonacci sequence and when you look at a person's face, there's a golden ratio of the nose to the eyes, the chin, and as soon as you fuck with anything, soon as you switch one of those up like lips, you're like, hey. Like if you look at say like Serena Williams, her lips match her face and there's like, there's a natural order to that. If you look at Arusha fear, his nose matches his chin matches his face. There's a, there's a ratio that it fits in and when you get a nose job and you're supposed to have a big nose, people look at you like, what the fuck is going on? What if you have like a Persian face, like a, you know, a big, robust Persian face. But you have this little fucking Pixie Irish knows people like what the fuck is going on with her face? This is crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:09:45       But Joe, there's so many people that have worked on that you'd like, we all know bad plastic surgery, but there's some that so good and we think of these people as being born that way mean there's dinner. Yes. Yes. That's a perfect one. I mean, girls always bring her up, let it out later that she was a monster. She's a monster now. She's gorgeous. I mean there's some stuff that works, but you're so right. Like I want to talk to you about psychedelics because when did you first do them? Most 30 when you were 30.

Speaker 3:          01:10:16       I think I was a little younger. No? Yeah, yeah. When I was 13 I started smoking pot and then a psychedelics dogs came after that.

Speaker 4:          01:10:24       And did you. I mean obviously that, that was before the time when people thought psychedelics were a way to like heal yourself. Like I feel like this is kind of like a new movement, that psychedelics are the answer.

Speaker 3:          01:10:37       You're around the right people. Back then you would get that information.

Speaker 4:          01:10:40       Were you around the right people? Is that how you got introduced to them? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:10:43       Yeah. I was around a lot of it because of the fact that I was a comedian. And then also because of the fact that, um, you know, I was relatively famous back then, not, not famous famous, but like pee. I was, I was on television. I've done some things so people would want to like turn you onto things, you know, like, you know, and I would go to parties or meet people and they would, you know, say, hey man, have you ever done mushrooms? Know. And, uh, hey man, you ever heard of DMT? And the like. And then there's a few different things that would happen and you'd be around these people who had gone to jail for it or you know, that we're like real psychedelic heads. And once I was around a few of those, I realized like, well, there's a whole nother world out there.

Speaker 3:          01:11:30       And then I discovered Timothy leary and John Lilly and this flotation tank became a giant part of my life. And then, um, you know, Terence Mckenna and Dennis Mckenna and all the various psychedelic wizards that are out there that I've been sort of expressing that there's, there's a whole world out there that you're not seeing. It's like we're living life inside this very strange tent is a very thin membrane tent. And if you just unzip that tent and step out, the entire wilderness of the universe exists. But most people live their life inside this very thin walled tent. And they think that that tent sort of defines the actual universe itself when it's, it's so small and so limited. Is there a chance that you opened that tent and you don't like what you see and now you've fucked your whole life up because I think that's most people's apprehension about shure specifically come back.

Speaker 3:          01:12:29       Yes, we'll sit bear it. You know, there's been a lot of people that were um, I mean, uh, I have friends that know friends that will. The issue is with psychosis and people that have schizophrenia, people that have legitimate mental illness, mental health issues. And they did the argument is correlation or causation. Right? And the argument is, does the psychedelic drugs caused mental illness or do a certain amount of people already have mental illness? And I think it's much more likely that the percentage of people that are schizophrenia remained static. Because if you, if you look at it like this, the number of people who smoke marijuana, who are also schizophrenia mirrors the number of people or schizophrenia period. So it's not that marijuana causes schizophrenia, so it's a one out of 100 or whatever the number is. They just have this issue, this, this.

Speaker 3:          01:13:23       And for those people it's critical that they avoid psychedelic drugs, that they avoid marijuana and probably even alcohol or many even maybe bunch of other psychotropic drugs as well because it could. You've got an imbalance. Just like someone who has a liver disease has an imbalance, just like someone who has a lung disorder can breathe well, someone assisting fibrosis or someone who has any number of diseases. You've got to kind of think of it that way. There's an ailment of the mind. And so if you add this unknown element to that ailment, like five grams of dried mushrooms, like, whoa, who the fuck knows what could happen? You might never come back. And then there's the question. The other part of your question is, is it possible you could open that tent and not like what you see and fuck up your life? Yes, yes. Even if you don't have or a mental

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       disorder, you might have a view of the world that's untenable with the experience that you have under the influence of psychedelics, but that might be the. Your view of the world is bullshit and you've been living your life with this fucking Norman Rockwell nonsense floating around your head because you've been so influenced by media, by songs and by television shows and buy, you know, I want to live like the kids on friends, they don't even live like that. Look at them. They're all fucked up. Now, you know, for the most part, Jennifer Aniston seems to be not aging. That's pitches is insane. That's my girl. I want to be around her. I want to find out what she's doing. What kind of cream are you using? Cream. It's lasers. Whatever the fuck she's doing. It's amazing. One hundred and 50 years old. She looks like she's 12.

Speaker 2:          01:14:57       It's incredible. You would feel bad if you had sex with it. Like you're having sex with an 18 year old. She looks amazing. She literally hasn't really done Matthew Perry. Looks like he's been to hell and back like that motherfucker went head first into a sand storm and he got his face ripped off. Like he's been just doing math every day and smoking cigarettes. One lighting the other from the time he's awake until the time he goes to sleep. He looks like total dog shit and she looks fucking amazing. I know they were. They worked together. They were both young together. Shared some skin care. A fuck. How the fuck. I mean that is like a perfect example. It is a perfect example. Even she can't keep it together. Right? She's on like some new marriage and I got divorced and it's like there's this chaos to this business and this what you were talking about, like the, like I've talked about this many times in the podcast at this business is nuts because it takes people that are insecure already and then puts them in a position where they have to get chosen for things. So you have to audition and people have to decide whether they like you next. Nikki. Hm. Hm. Okay. Nikki. So a central show. He had a comedy central show that uh, didn't work out.

Speaker 5:          01:16:13       It just, you know, there was an internal thing. It wasn't any good. You were on dancing with the stars for a hot minute. Yeah. Again, that was just like, there were just, I'm. That guy was really mean to you. What was that all about? I think I've reminded him of a granddaughter who has called him in the judges that are such assholes.

Speaker 2:          01:16:34       Anyway, so you're reading for Amy and amy is an anorexic standup comedian who likes to drink and blackout. So, uh, right up your alley. So here we go. And so, and then you do it and go, okay, well thanks a lot Niki. Good job. Uh, okay. And so you'll call me. Yeah, no, you'll

Speaker 5:          01:17:00       kind of just watched the show that you're auditioning for and see someone else in the role and that's how you'll know, scream. So you. And

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       then you walk out feeling like a hundred percent dog shit. Like you're from the top of your head to the bottom of your toes is just dog shit. And we do this stuff and you got people commenting on it and tweeting at you and saying mean. It's like you're right. It's like I'm in this business because I'm insecure and I want people to strangers to love me. And then I don't even accept the love that they give. I don't care about the tweets that are nice. I reject those and I think you're crazy. And then I think, which I don't read comments or anything like I've been really good about like self care of that's not ever going to bring me joy is going through the comments of a youtube video. But um, but still mean things get through and yeah, you're right, like I am a really strong person to be where I am in this business and have gotten as far as I've got, but it breaks me at times still and I'm scared and I'm spent.

Speaker 4:          01:18:09       I'm so excited to do psychedelics. Are you kidding me? I, I'm, I'm excited. Like I. Well I want to do it with a shaman if you're available, but I wanted to, I want to do it in like a really controlled way because I do think it's the next frontier for me in terms of, because I'm done with therapy talk therapy. I'm like, this is too slow of a process. I did mushrooms once but it was not a good experience because it wasn't bad setting a very small amount and not enough to really have a good trip. Even though it was a small amount of still a bad experience. It was just bad because I was hanging out with two people that are coupled. That got into a fight while I was with them and they kicked me out onto the street in New York City. While they were on mushrooms, they don't want to fight on mushrooms.

Speaker 4:          01:18:54       Yeah, just got kind of tense hanging out with them. We were supposed to just like us three chill on their roof and like look at the skyline and just have a nice night. But then his girlfriend got sick. They were in a weird kind of bickering thing. I was like, I'm going to go. I left. I had been arrested the night before for smoking weed on the street, so I'd spent six hours in a holding cell the night before. But I had planned to do mushrooms the day after and the guy was like, you should still do and we'll celebrate you getting out of jail. And I was like, okay. So I did mushrooms. I was broke. I had just been arrested. I, um, and I was on the street and I remember I called my parents because I was, I just felt like the way that smoking weed is portrayed in movies where it's like, oh, things coming at you.

Speaker 4:          01:19:36       Like, you know, that's the way I felt on mushrooms. Like, I don't know if that's the normal way, but like I felt like everyone was just like in my face. I called my mom and I go, mom, I'm on mushrooms right now. I'm on the upper east side. I'm just trying to get to my friend Mike's House. And she goes, who do you think you're talking to? You don't call your mom and say you're on much. Like she was like for once in our life she had boundaries. If she goes, she goes, talk to your father. And so then I talked to my dad. I was like, Oh, I'm on most rooms that I don't know. And he kind of talked me down, but I just went home and chugged a bottle of wine because I was like, I want to be. I want to feel something else other than this because I felt too much.

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       I felt a lot of love in that scared me. But this was before I quit drinking a lot of love. And that scared you? Yeah, I was like calling my friends being like, I love you, like it in a way that I'd never felt before, and I was like, I don't like this feeling, chug, chug, chug. I don't know what. Maybe it's because you were alone. I think it was. I was going through a lot of things that was like I was, I think it was billy mic at that time. This was not a good time in my life. I had to be doing psychedelics, but now I think I, I've read enough about them and I'm like, you know, there are soldiers who have ptsd that go through talk therapy for years and have no have minimal amounts of progress and, and, and, and then they do one thing of dmt and they're like, I'm good. Like there's something there. I can't wait for whatever that is. I want to do IOWASCA. I want to do DMT, I want to, I want to open up those doors.

Speaker 3:          01:21:07       Great for soldiers to. That's their maps is doing some really serious trials right now with MDM may assisted therapy. So they're taking people with PTSD, whether it's soldiers, victims of violence, and they're taking them through a MTMA assisted therapy and they're having some pretty dramatic results.

Speaker 4:          01:21:28       I think it is like the next big. I'm so excited about it for certain people and myself. Like I just

Speaker 3:          01:21:34       done Mtma ecstasy. No, I only did it once and the, the rebound the next day was horrific for me. That was one of the worst hangovers I've ever had. Like it wasn't just a hangover, it was, I was, I felt really stupid. Like I couldn't read. Like I was trying to read a magazine the next day I couldn't read and then I had to perform that night and I kind of ate shit on stage and um, but I'll never forget the lessons from the experience. It was very powerful, like a really illuminated how much insecurity hinders you and inhibits your ability to communicate with people and flavors, how you interact with people. And how much of my own aggression and the way I would interact with people was basically just me being scared.

Speaker 4:          01:22:23       Like what? What? I want to know what Joe Rogan was before psychedelics, like what are the things that you socially, the hurdles that you've overcome? Well, what were you like? What were the things that you're like, oh my God, I can't believe I was like that. I'm dying to know this.

Speaker 3:          01:22:37       Well, you know, when I was young I was super insecure. My parents split up when I was really young and then we moved around a lot so it didn't have like a base of friends. And then I found martial arts when I was a young teenager and what martial arts did was it gave me something that I finally felt like I wasn't a loser at. It was like the first thing that I ever did where I was like, oh, I, I'm good at something. I can be really good at something. And I got good at it really quickly because I was obsessed. I was completely addicted and I was training every day and it became my identity. So my identity was that I was really good at martial arts and so to be really good at martial arts, especially in competition, you have to be, you have to be very aggressive, you have to be ruthless and you have to be like, you have to embrace this sort of the, there's, there's an undeniable violence and kicking someone in the head, I mean it's very, it's very violent, like martial arts competitions, extremely violent and you have to be able to embrace that and the embracing of that and the terror and the fear of it all, just that it shaped my, my developmental period.

Speaker 3:          01:23:47       So like when I was 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, that was my whole life. That was all I did until I started doing standup comedy. So my entire form formative period was based on violence. It was all, it was all. I mean it was, it was martial arts. It was very controlled and well I wasn't like a bad person who is a beating people up or anything like that. But my, I was ready to go all the time. Like it was all, it was always any edit around any corner. That might be something the next person might say the wrong thing and you might realize you're going to have to fight them or whatever, whatever it was, and that took a long time to let go. That took a long time to like shake off.

Speaker 2:          01:24:37       Are you easily angered? Would you get into fights? No, I didn't really get into. I was smart. Like I will avoid fights. So you were 10, you were anxious? Constantly. Well, I, my, my personality developed through violence. Me really develop through martial arts, competition through from the time I was 15 to Thomas Twenty one I traveled the entire country. It was all I did was fighting tournament's. I fought all the time. I fought like, I don't know how many times. Do you have girlfriends? Like I mean you were upset you were you really going to Olympic athlete? You were an elite elite athlete at 15. Did you? What was your 15? But by the time I was 17 I was boy when I was 18 I won the state championship. Well, to get to that point is my social life and elite was going to say it had to have just been know it was, it was awkward and weird.

Speaker 2:          01:25:24       You know, you like with girls and stuff early on were you. Did you do okay. All right. I mean, you know, high school, I had girlfriends in high school and then there was a dry period after high school for sure, and then once I started doing standup comedy then then it was easy and there's a wet period. Then it was crazy that it's like, whoa. It's like, that is nuts. But yeah, my, my life was all about competing and being at a gym so there wasn't like a lot of time to meet people. It was all very strange. But there's this getting over that, that hurt the hurdle of that bizarre childhood. Was there a moment

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       though when you came out of a trip or what? Was there a, like a nugget that you took where you were like, oh, this is bullshit. Was there a certain trip that you like look to and you're like, I emerged a different person and what does that,

Speaker 3:          01:26:15       one of them, one of them highlighted unnecessary tension. Highlighted.

Speaker 4:          01:26:22       What was the last one? What did you learn in the last trip you had?

Speaker 3:          01:26:25       The last one I had was basically, it was almost a reef, a reaffirmation more than anything. It was, it was like, oh, I remember this. Like I hadn't done it in about a year and a half to two years. And then, uh, we all, we did dmt three or four times. We did like a a trip and then we went back in, went back in again. I can't remember his three or four times, but it was. It just made me realize like, oh yeah, okay, this. This is just the though the world that you're living in is like a thin veneer over this gigantic, impossible realm of souls of love and expectation and and understanding and information and that that's what the universe is made of and that you're sort of trapped in this very strange, rudimentary, tactile existence where you can pick things up and put them on scales and you can measure things with a ruler, but the rest of the universe is not made of that stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:27:31       The rest of the universe is made out of ideas. The rest of the universe is made out of thoughts and there's dimensions that you you can't travel to with your feet and with a car, with a plane, like there's portals that you go through and these portals of chemical portals and your brain literally is wired for these. Not only that, your brain produces dimethyltryptamine, which is the most potent of all psychedelics. It's literally made by the human body and it's, it's everywhere. It's in all sorts of plants, thousands of plants. It's in every animal. It's like all these different creatures create it. They have it. I mean, in Europe. It's actually made by your third eye there. Pretty sure you know, there's, um, there's a group out of New Mexico called the Cottonwood Research Foundation, and they're doing these tests on all sorts of tests to find out the source of DMT and they've isolated in the pineal gland of rats and this is the first time they've ever shown it in a live rat that it exists in the pineal gland.

Speaker 3:          01:28:35       The pineal gland is literally your third eye, like that thing from eastern mysticism like this right here, this little audio here and reptiles, that actually is a retina in the lens. It's a, it's an eyeball, and this is in the Egyptian would call it the seed of the soul. And this one spot in your head is producing the most potent psychedelic chemical known to man as well as it's produced by your liver and your lungs, like your body's psychedelic chemical factory. And this one psychedelic chemicals, they believe, and there's been some recent research, there was a recent paper that was put out that showed that they think that during periods of extreme stress, like would periods if your body body's convinced that you might be dying or that there's something happening that you may be releasing this psychedelic chemical, so it might be the portal to the afterlife, like it might be the way that carries your consciousness through to the next dimension when your body passes for this,

Speaker 4:          01:29:33       when you're in distress, because it feels like it's getting ready to watch your, your mom.

Speaker 3:          01:29:37       But yeah, your body's like, this might be it, this might be it. Here we go. Let's. They think that's the source of near death experiences. When people have these phenomenal loving experiences where they crossover to the other side, then they come back and they think that this. And you know when, the way the way people describe it, that's another issue with psychedelic drugs. It's impossible. Describe. So when you describe it, it's so crude, like the words, the way I've described it, as I say, it's you. You enter into another dimension filled with complex geometric patterns that are made out of love and understanding that that's what it takes, but it's still. It's a bunch of words. It's like a nonsense thing to describe, but when you will, you talked to these people that have had near death experiences. They all feel relieved in some sort of a strange way.

Speaker 3:          01:30:20       They all feel like, or a lot of them do. I should say that when it does happen, if it does happen, it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Like there's a thing that happens. Then you go to this other place where there's. There's no shoes, there's no tables, there's no electricity in this house, but it's, it's made out of whatever the fuck the world's made out of. It's made out of the, the whatever the universe actually has below the wiring. Like you lift up the circuit board and we're like, Whoa, you peer behind the green curtain.

Speaker 4:          01:30:49       So at this point for you, when you, when you did it the last time, it was almost like a tune up of like, oh yeah, I remember now seen this before and I needed to be reminded. But then how does that. Sorry if I'm asking questions that you've probably already answered, but like how does the next week of your life after a trip of this, like how do your, does your decision making change? What happened? It's up

Speaker 3:          01:31:11       to you, right? That's up to you. It's up to everybody when everyone is different. I mean for me it's a, it was like a big deep breath and it's like, oh, it's going to be okay. The last time I did like a real serious psychedelic trip. I've done a little bit of acid, a little bit of mushrooms, but the last time that a serious one was right before I've filmed triggered and uh, it's just, um, it just, it just lets you know, like, um, you know, just just do your best to try to be nice and this is nonsense. This whole thing is nonsense. You know, don't concentrate on the fact that in 20 years, no one's going to want to fuck you, or you know that your, your, your tits gonna fall off or just you're alive right now. You're, you are existing right now in the one of the craziest experiences that the world has ever being a human being in 2018 in the United States of America.

Speaker 3:          01:32:03       I mean this is a fucking bizarre pathway. You're on. All of us, every single person listening to this, if you can listen to this podcast, you are in the rarest moment in human history. You are literally at the cost, the very peak of this insane merging, the same merging of technology, of information, of understanding, of expression, all the stuff that you see, all the stuff that we're seeing going on right now socially, whether it's the me too movement or whether it is, um, know social justice warriors and people who are woke and crying out, racist for listening. All this bubbling up of our culture is all this recognition of this ability to communicate this, this radical new ability to express your ideas that is being done by some people that are responsible. Some people that are very responsible, but everyone gets a shot and it's just like youtube comments.

Speaker 3:          01:33:00       It's fucking chaos. You know, Clark culture is youtube comments. They'll the world is youtube comments. Our interaction is this unique ability where anybody can express themselves and some people have larger signals like you or like shift fear or like you know, fill in the blank. Anybody who has a podcast, they have a larger signal and you know, you have a youtube video that's a larger signaling of a comedy central show that's a larger signal, but everyone has a signal and everyone's fighting for relevance and everyone's fighting for attention and acceptance and there they're fighting for their own significance. They just want to exist and they're yelling out and sometimes the yelling out like a baby and sometimes the yelling out like a wise person on the mountain who has some new information and it's all happening at the same time. And it's all just and we're sorting it out like in some things don't stick like this whole, if you're having sex and you're drinking, you're a rapist like that didn't stick.

Speaker 3:          01:33:57       But some of them do stay. Some of them you can't say retarded anymore. That one's sticking, right? Like, and people are realizing there's certain things that you can do and certain things you can't do. Certain things we accept certain things we can't accept anymore and we're figuring it out and we're figuring it out in real time, in a, at a radical pace that's never existed before in human history where something that was acceptable just 10, 15 years ago is completely unacceptable now that's. There's never been a time like that before. Never been a time in the entire world since people started talking. There's never been a time where change is taking place at such a radical pace and you're a part of it and I'm a part of it and everyone is listening to this as a part of it. We're all together in this and no one knows where the fuck is going.

Speaker 4:          01:34:41       I love that you're. You're saying that the reason all this is happening right now is because we are now, we're just communicating at a more rapid pace. That's all it boils down to. You're absolutely right. It's the communication revolution.

Speaker 3:          01:34:54       Yeah. Yeah. And if so, if someone says, you know, hey, you, what? Were you sad? It doesn't make sense. Like, yeah, yeah, for sure. No one's going to get it right. No one's going to get it right all the time, like no one does. No, I'm not an oracle fucking human. I was born in New Jersey. No one's getting this right,

Speaker 4:          01:35:11       but you are being held to that standard. We all are now something.

Speaker 3:          01:35:15       What's good? There's good to that too. The good is you realize like when you're responsible, like if you make a mistake or you say something incorrect or you say something mean, they were just trying to be funny. It came out bad. The, the blow back, let's you know, this is how people feel about that and it's disproportionate because your signals disproportionate. The, your ability to express yourself as disproportionate. So the blow back is going to be disproportion as well. So it feels awful, but that's just an affirmation, just letting you know, okay, this is not what p and, and sometimes people are completely wrong about like, you know, white girls can't wear hoop earrings. It's cultural appropriation. There's, there's bad signals out there because a lot of bad signals, you know, where you're racist if you wear a Kimono, just a of like really dumb bad signals.

Speaker 3:          01:36:01       But there's also a lot of exchange and it'll all work itself out. We just have to be really careful. We don't lynch a lot of people along the way, like the wood that we don't get convinced that our ideas are 100 percent the way things should be and that we listened to all these various ideas, whether it's ideas about trans people or gay people or women or men or anybody, you know, like it's, it's like it's super important now that people think before they act and that they think before they cast judgment that we have to communicate because there's things are fucking flying at us. Like fish coming down a river and trying to catch them with your hands. And there's this too many of them.

Speaker 4:          01:36:45       Do you, I mean, you're broadcasting every single day for hours. Do you say things sometimes that come back? I mean, I know you say things that come back to haunt you or you said this and that was wrong, that you said that, and this is why you're wrong. Do you, do you ever catch yourself and go, oh yeah, I shouldn't have said that all time. What do you do with that? That's of I made a mistake. I, I misspoke. Right? But not. This was not an oracle.

Speaker 3:          01:37:09       If you keep talking, people go, oh, I get it. Nikki's just the person that says things sometimes what you don't mean to say dumb things, but you're like being a human being. It's just a flawed exercise. Like we're super flawed and we're working with language, which is like a really awkward way to express intent. You know, it's awkward. This is sometimes the right. Yeah. Sometimes the right word is not there for you and you use a lot of likes and um, so it's like, um, like a, like a and people like, like what? People are listening, they're on the fucking stair climber and they'll go, you shut the fuck up, you talk too much, you complain too much, and you know their signal like they're mad that they don't have a signal, so they're fucking screaming at you for your flawed signal. Do you have a responsibility? You know, there's a lot going

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       on. There's a lot going on.

Speaker 4:          01:37:57       There is and yeah, I mean I have, I have a radio show every day that I do and I do podcast and even sitting here now I'm like, oh, what am I going to regret saying? And I've just gotten to a point where it's like, I will apologize if I say something stupid and wrong and offend someone and I really feel bad about it, but like I have to lead from a place of guidance at this point in my life. I know I'm a good person. I don't think I'm a secret psychopath, which I think a lot of us are always like, am I a bad person? Deep down, do you ever have that fee? Did you use to have that feeling where you're like, people are going to figure out that I'm a fucking psychopath?

Speaker 2:          01:38:34       You know what? I really wish that I was like Tony Danza. Tony Danza was always smiling and he was always nice to people. I was like, I want to kill everybody, and Tony Danza is also nice and smiling. I just want to fucking smash people and Tony Danza just seems like such a nice guy. Like God, I wish I was like Tony Danza. I used to think that when I was like 19 years old,

Speaker 4:          01:38:54       I can tell. I totally relate to that. I see people and I go, why can't I just be like her and just smiling, smiling and say funny, nice things that don't offend anyone but also everyone likes what you say and it still gets people jazzed up, but you're not offending anyone. It doesn't feel good to offend people. And I say things all the time that do, and I'm not going to stop because I just, I can't,

Speaker 2:          01:39:19       but you're offending people but also making a large amount laugh. Know the problem is the. If you have 100 people in the room and 10 of them get offended, 90 of them are fucking slap in the table and laughing their ass off. That's. You got to accept that. That's just part of the game. That's part of the game. You and I play. We play a strange game. We're in one of the weirdest businesses ever. We're in the business of talking shit. We're shit.

Speaker 4:          01:39:42       I love it. I love talking shop and I can't stop. Right. Do you get, do you get in trouble talking shit like di Di do you feel? Because I feel like sometimes when I talk shit about people, it's obviously I'm just, I'm talking about myself and I'm, I'm just projecting like, oh she's, you know what? I'm really talking shit backstage where I don't think anyone will ever tell this to anyone. Right. It's not a, it's supposed to be like not a good thing to do is talk shit. Like that's not healthy for hands on, but I love it. It's fun. It's a hobby. It's fun.

Speaker 2:          01:40:14       You're making fun of things. You're making fun of things and it makes sense. If you're talking shit and it doesn't make any sense and no one wants to talk shit with you, but if you go to Nicky and Nicky said some hilarious,

Speaker 4:          01:40:24       that's all your soldier, that's fun and when you see both, hate someone together and you could just send each other snap screenshots of their instagram and be like, look how sad this bitches when really I'm just seeing myself in her

Speaker 2:          01:40:39       sometimes when you're saying oftentimes what you absolutely hope you never are,

Speaker 4:          01:40:44       yes, but that you fear that you are and you think you might be. So it's, it's, it's me hating a tiny piece of myself that I'm trying so hard to keep it at bay will be parent or sad or you're hating me.

Speaker 2:          01:40:57       Human behavior. That's flawed. That's where you're heading.

Speaker 4:          01:40:59       Yeah, because I don't want to be flawed and I'm secretly feeling flawed because I am flawed because we all are, but it's part of. It's a way to

Speaker 2:          01:41:07       forest that. You'll never going to do that again, but talking shit about people that are doing

Speaker 4:          01:41:11       hold yourself accountable because then you can't talk shit if you do it. So it keeps you in check. That's a really good point. So it's good to do. Yeah. There's some group text messages. I know you mean my God, where are you only talk about one person in that we only go to that mass text to talk shit about that one person. Oh, have you ever talked. Have you ever sent a text to someone that you were talking shit like shit about the person? No, but it happens. There are stories of people sending. Like this one girl the other day told me like in a makeup chair, she was like, oh, I want sent someone a text about someone at work that we are currently working with. That was like Buffalo. Buffalo is a fat piece of shit today. Kimberly. She would wear that dress like that specific to her and she was working with her and had to work with her the rest of the day.

Speaker 4:          01:42:02       It happens all the time. It happens all the time. Just slipped up, send it to the wrong person. Is telling you, Joe, be careful because we're all capable of when you write that name, when you're writing a name and a text, it's so easy to just. That person is probably in your phone too to send it to them. It's totally possible. But yeah, I, I love talking to you. I think that is a thing comics have in common and you know, when I extend making fun of things that I'm getting shit talked about me because it has to happen. If I'm talking to this much shit, people are talking shit about me and I accept it and it's fine. I don't want to ever know. I hate when people go, Oh, you know what? Someone was talking about you and why would you tell me that? Be Nice. Well, if you overhear something, keep that in that thing. Well, unless

Speaker 2:          01:42:45       person's like a really good friend and then you find out that they're backstabbing you. You want to know that?

Speaker 4:          01:42:50       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:42:53       They're saying things to a guy you're dating.

Speaker 4:          01:42:55       Oh yeah. Oh, if that. Oh God,

Speaker 2:          01:43:00       that's the dirtiest of dirty. When you find out for a guy, when you find out that a friend of yours is talking shit about you to a girl, you're dating.

Speaker 4:          01:43:09       Oh, and that happens a lot because guys that I've had that happen to me with guys where it's like, watch out for this guy. I'm like, aren't you best friends? That's a dirty man. That's a good person. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:43:19       Yeah. Me and my friends, we have a very strict policy of what we call jihadi, which means like if you're around a girl that the guy likes you blow him up to her, say, oh, he's the best guys. Awesome. I love that guy. As long as he is. And if he's not, it shouldn't be friends with them anyway, but as long as he is, you let him know, like, you know, fill in the blank. Mike is just a fucking phenomenal guy. He's, he's such a good dude all the time. Like he loves you too. Says great things about it.

Speaker 4:          01:43:48       I'm already into this guy that you're talking about in this example.

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       I'm like, yes. I'm like, dude, when I was around, you know, whatever, shelly. I was like, boom, I blew out my friend Eddie Bravo came up with that term because I would do that. He goes, dude, you totally jihad at me for that girl. That's what we're doing. You just blow you up. Let everybody know. Knows guy's awesome. He's the best. I do that a lot. It feels good too. It feels the opposite of talking shit

Speaker 4:          01:44:15       if you're not lying. Yeah. It makes us more in that line as long as you're not lying. I love that. Yeah, but,

Speaker 2:          01:44:22       but it's hard. You know, the, the petty instinct is to talk shit. That's the petty instincts. Some people deserve it and some people don't. You know, it's, there's different motivations, right? Like sometimes you talk and shit because you're really jealous of someone. You're jealous of their effort, their work ethic, their success, the way they look. What a, what, fill in the blank. You're jealous of something about them. That's generally for me,

Speaker 4:          01:44:44       root of that. If I'm going to be honest, I, I recently got busted talking shit about someone and I told and she, it got back to me from another friend and I wrote their own, I go, I'm jealous of you. You're cool and you're who I want to be and I want to be friends with you and you didn't seem to want to be friends with me. So I decided I hated you and that you weren't to be trusted. And I told people that and it wasn't true. It completely wasn't true. As threatened by you and you're hot and I don't like that you exist in the same business as me and it makes me jealous. And what did she say? And she said, I totally get that. And I, at first she goes, at first she just thumbs down my apology, which I loved.

Speaker 4:          01:45:21       And then I was like, we're going to be good. But I, I love good. I love apologizing. I love, like admitting when I've been jealous or petty and I will continue to do so. But if I'm caught I'm just, I can be. So it got back to me that I said about this girl that she shouldn't be trusted and I go, I don't even know why I would say that about her. I have no evidence to back that up equals I was just petty and jealous in that moment. So I wrote her. I was like, dude, I don't know what was going through my mind that week. But yeah, I did say that about you because

Speaker 2:          01:45:51       standard, it's a standard instinct. It's a standard emotion. So common.

Speaker 4:          01:45:57       Yeah. And, and, and as a woman in this business, like I just, I support women's so much, but I'm aware of every woman who is a who was doing the same thing I'm doing in this book, like I'm aware who are the up and comers and I'd take them under my wing and I build them up. But I'm like, I'm aware of like there's a part of me that's like crazy deep breath. That was me seeing a headline of them on deadline. He's just like, I know have a new show. I know that it's good for all of us.

Speaker 2:          01:46:34       We have a new show and it's in the slot that your show was in.

Speaker 4:          01:46:38       You know what it is. I literally have to unfollow girls sometimes who I'm friends with who are in, who are comedians, who are my peers and who I respect and think they're funny. I have to unfollow them if I see that they're just like, I'm working a lot right now and they're putting it out there that they're like really busy with work and I just got kicked off dancing with the stars. I have to unfollow them because I start to feel sad about myself and I would rather just remove that from my feed then and then it's a really awkward follow when I know that or they messaged me on one of those things and they see I'm not following them because it's like we all know we follow each other. They know and sometimes I'll just tell them I've unfollowed you because you, you make me feel sad about my own career over that. It's easier to just take them out of my feed. Yeah, but that's a weird one. I am looking to get over it. I am, I am

Speaker 2:          01:47:30       just just use it as informal as inspiration. Use them as fuel to work harder.

Speaker 4:          01:47:35       Yeah, I do. But I would also like to not see their tour dates scheduled. Crazy. Crazy. That one go. That's not a good one to accept. I don't think, you know what I probably, I'm probably going to unfollow one. All, all you guys with your, with your workouts and your calorie counts that you post mad shit. But I'd even post the big one. I didn't triggering as fuck to people who are like, you know, hate their bodies and stuff. It can be very triggering. So like when I see girls, they're like, I just ran a marathon. I'm like unfollow, I can't, I can't have you in my life bragging about this shit. Listen, I go to the gym too and I don't tweet about it. I want to. I just so many calories but I don't tweet tweet about it because I don't want to trigger people and I don't want to be the. I don't want to be what I am so jealous of, but I should brag about it. And I also liked that some people are like, look at what I did at the gym. Fuck you. I'd worked today. And they're proud of themselves, but I can't. I can't see. I get inspired. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:48:40       Do you know who I go to? Like all the time for inspiration? The Rock. That motherfucker never stops. He never stops. I mean, I don't want to do what he's doing. I don't want to do these movies. I don't want to do what he's doing, but that I fucking admire the shit out of that guy's work ethic. That guy. I'll fly to Tokyo, it will be 4:00 in the morning. He sets up an elliptical machine, starts going after it. That's what he does.

Speaker 4:          01:49:02       And that doesn't make. That doesn't put you in a place of like, I'm, I'm never, I can't do that because you can. But the thing is, Joe Rogan, you can do that. Look at that. Look at all his food and he gets to do that. Oh God.

Speaker 2:          01:49:13       He landed in London, midnight ordered Sushi like a motherfucker go to. Is His instagram with all of

Speaker 4:          01:49:20       this is you are the Rock Joe. You are the Rock, you do these workouts all the time and that's how you get that shirt. Rock. I got to text x

Speaker 2:          01:49:41       today from David Goggins and I told David Goggins I'm trying to beat everyone by double. He's like, fucking kill it. Like capital 100 exclamation points. That's what I'm saying. Look at that dude focused. I see that I want to go work out right now.

Speaker 4:          01:50:00       Are you insecure about anything right now in your life?

Speaker 2:          01:50:03       Well, people are always insecure, you know, I mean there's not something that's like, well, I'm always insecure about my act. I'm always working on it, you know, I'm always trying to pick it apart and look at it like, like someone who hates it. I'm always trying to like where's the flaws? You know? And always trying.

Speaker 4:          01:50:19       I heard you talking about that the other day of like, now that you've done your specialists out and like watching it, now you come up with new tags. Oh God

Speaker 2:          01:50:26       always, always. But that's so because you're always growing and learning and getting better. And I think comedy is like a living thing. It's like as a live you keep watering and it keeps growing, you know, and sometimes you have to trim things to make it better. Just like a Bush, you know, Trim a little here, trimodal there, it gets fuller, you know, there's, but then also grows and gets bigger, you know, but then you got to release it at a certain point in time. My, my, my schedule seems to be two years, it seems to be. I develop a full solid hour and a year and then I hammered that motherfucker like a Samurai sword for the next eight months and then I film it and then four months later it airs and then I start

Speaker 4:          01:51:04       credit card ashy and bet in the new specialists in the last one. The last one that's triggered. That one was. So I've seen that your stuff is, but how do you write, like do you, do you literally write right or.

Speaker 2:          01:51:19       Oh right, right. Yeah. I'll show you how right. Use One of the things that I use, I've been using over the last couple of years. I always write like in Microsoft word and shit like that, but I use this program called scrivener that I really like and the reason why I really like it, especially when I'm doing new stuff is the way it's set up. Like if you, uh, was this,

Speaker 4:          01:51:41       oh wait, I know the bed that is in the new one that I love that you've just done the women inventing things. Oh my God. That bit I saw that grow. That was a devastating bit because the first time I saw it it was like already like one of those bits. Where are you as a comedian? You Watch and you just go, I can't. What am I doing? One of those, you know, we've all, we've all been in the back of the room going, what am I doing? If that's what's happening? And then I, that was like early stages of that bit and then it became something so much more. I haven't seen your special yet. I'm excited to see where it landed, but that wasn't an, that's an incredible bed. But where does that start for you?

Speaker 2:          01:52:20       So this is what this in Scrivener, if you see here, like all on this, this is all my new stuff. So these are all the categories and I click on each category and when I go to each category I have all the material that I've written out about each side. End caps was, it's not cool to kick robot. Do you know what that's about? Peta? Peta released a statement because Boston dynamics

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       has created these robots that are self balancing. So they have like a gyroscope in them. So these scientists were kicking these robots, these four legged robots and Peta released a statement saying that it's not cool to kick robots. Yes, this, this. They did. I'm like, you fucking weak pussies. This is going to be problem number one. When the robots take over these fucking people are gonna. They're gonna open up the door. Like you know, robots are alive and they're, they're sentient and you can't kick them. You know they're going to eat your family fuck. And the same point in time, you know, they're coming up with these, you know, more and more advanced artificial intelligence. So this is how right write. So these, this is essentially stage two. So Stage one is, you know, I do everything in Microsoft word, so this is in Microsoft word. All of these are.

Speaker 4:          01:53:35       And it's just like you just loose thoughts. You're not really editing as you go. Okay. Exactly. So like

Speaker 3:          01:53:41       this, which one is this? This one is um, this is a lot. Yeah, I write you gotta write. This is how I think. I think. I think you've got to do two things. You got to Ad Lib, you got to do it on stage, you got to work things out on stage. But I think you're foolish to not write as well because I think there's so much to be gained by sitting in front of a computer working on your act. That's one step. Another step is you have to review your act. You have to listen to it or watch it. Preferably watch it. Like I learned a lot watching the editing when I was editing this special and I snapped. I had a snip, I decided I wanted to be an hour and my set was like an hour and 17 minutes, so I said let me just cut, just, I just want it to just fuck it.

Speaker 3:          01:54:22       Boom, just one hour, boom and done. So I had caught a couple of bits out, but when I did that I was like watching the videos. Like, you know what? I should really videotape everything. I should watch the video because it's so much more immersive than just audio. You. You only get so much out of audio. I kind of know my expressions, all the different things that I'm doing, but when I see them I go, oh, it's better if I move like this or it's better if I pause there. It's better if I raise my eyebrows. It's better if I look concerned.

Speaker 4:          01:54:53       Don't realize how much of comedy is the physical thing until you do watch it. You're so right and, and you're right about writing it down. Anytime. I've had to do a transcript because I don't write anything down Longhand, but when I've had to do a transcript for tonight show or like just for laughs festival and see it. Then you start writing new tags and you're like, all this took was for me to write it out, but then what do you do for Microsoft word? Then you take it to take it to that scrivener and then what do you do there? I

Speaker 3:          01:55:19       put it. I'd take the stuff from Microsoft word and then I trim it down and when I trim it down I put it in Scribnar and when I trim it down and put it in Scribnar, what I'm essentially doing is saying, okay, this is ready, this is ready to play, and then what it's scrivener do. Oh Shit. I left my notebook in a hotel room. God Damn it. Someone's going to freak out. So then from there I write things out on an actual notebook and the actual notebook is basically just to get my set list in order and to make sure I highlight all the different tags. So there's three stages. There's the Microsoft word stage, which is basically just free form free association writing things down. No, there's no structure to it. Sometimes it comes out like a bit. Sometimes it's just nonsense that never goes anywhere. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:56:10       You needed to get out anyway so you could get to others.

Speaker 3:          01:56:12       Yeah. You will. You just urging. Yeah, well it's. I don't know if you need it, but it's like there's a road and get onto and as you're on that road all of a sudden like, oh look, I found a bag of gold and, and you don't find that bag of gold. If you stay home, you gotta walk, you gotTa get out there and that's, that's what the writing does with the writing does it allows you to pick up these little bags of gold along the way. And then I'd take these little bags of gold when I pile them up and then I throw them into the fortress and the fortress is like scrivener, so then I can move those bits around like what is it? Why is that different than Microsoft word? The reason why it's different is because it's set up in columns, right?

Speaker 3:          01:56:48       So you see how uh, and it's also as corkboard see Jamie's got it up on the big screen. So when the court records see how it's set up right here, like each one of these things, if you go to the left side here, each one of these categories I can move and I can, I can change, I can have that bit in the beginning and then once I'm in the bit I could also go to this and that sets me up with a cork board so I can have like, I could set up little note, like little a setlists. Well like that, like up there little notepad things. So I can write down these on these index cards. Like don't forget this or this is important here or this tagline, huge try switching this around and

Speaker 5:          01:57:33       it's just this constant. But are you already like this or you already this kind of an organized person. Have you always been this way or did you get. You have to know this is a discipline thing that if you can teach yourself to be like that, because I just feel like some people are made that way. This is not me. No, no, not like this at all. This is just look at your backpack. You just brought out in every pocket as a thing and a pen as just cleaned it up. No, you're like that. No, no, no. If you caught that three days ago, he's fucking. Wires are coming out. Are like chaos and domestic guns really. That makes me and so many people listening feel so good right now. I cleaned it up a lot, but a lot of times your house, like, I mean I know you probably have people come in and clean, but like if you're in a hotel room over the weekend and don't have a maid service, what are we looking at? Chaos. Everything's spread out all over the place and you throw it hits the ground

Speaker 3:          01:58:29       I'm in. When I'm in a room like a hotel room. Um, it's basically like battle camp. I'm ready to roll. No, I'm not going to care what it looks like. You know, I'm here like I'm want a clear path to the shower. You know, I, I have a desk. As soon as I get into the hotel room, I set the computer down the desk, I plug it in, get connected to the Wifi and then I, you know, it depends on how long I'm there for what I'm, what I'm going to do and then you know, I get to work, you know, if I'm there, I'm there to work. So that's. I set everything up,

Speaker 4:          01:59:01       spent time folding shirts and socks and shit and put different things in compartments.

Speaker 3:          01:59:07       No full shit. I also buy these shirts. There's a company that I work with called Mizzen and main and they make these shirts that are like Super Flexi. I'm going to have you ever seen me wear, wear these shirts on stage? I wore it on my last special special. They're like pajamas there. You pull on them and they have a flex to them so they don't feel like anything and they never get wrinkly. So I could roll that bitch up in a ball, throw it into the suitcase and then pull it out and wear it and you would never know. Efficient. But it's just, they're the best to wear because when you're on stage they don't feel like anything. They feel like you're wearing nothing. What is this again? Ms Dot and main. Is the name of the competition? Do they make women's stuff? That's a good question. I do not know find out. So I wear them and I wear these jeans that have like flex to them. So the genes are like pajamas too. Like the jeans, they're literally like sweatpants, like you pull them, they snap so they don't get wrinkly either.

Speaker 4:          02:00:00       And what's your like, like your regimen, like your, your skincare regimen. Do you spend a lot of time on that stuff before you go to bed? Are you washing your face? Are you applying oils and creams? Like are you. Yeah. Yeah. But you don't attend a lot of times you don't waste a lot of time doing stuff that doesn't. You're very utilitarian. But like not just botox. If that's you mean I'm a man? No, I don't think. I definitely don't think you look like your best self. Like I'm saying like you literally see major list to me. I don't understand you like, but it is interesting to me because I would have thought you were very meticulous with like organization and wasted a lot of time organizing things and I like that you don't.

Speaker 3:          02:00:42       Oh No, no, no, no, no. I think you have to have both. There has to be. Look if you're a comic, right? If you're good. Especially I think there's a certain amount of you that has to be impulsive. It has to be reckless and impulsive and you have to be like one move away from ruining your life all the time, but you have to keep it under control. It's like you have a wolf and you have it behind like this flimsy chain link fence that you just like, oh, I'm going to wire this fucking shot and I'm going to go to work and I hope the wolf doesn't get out. That's literally what it's got to be like. But then you also have to have discipline and I think those two counterbalance each other and one of the things that's helped my act tremendously over the last few years. I think my, my I think triggered was my best special ever and I think this one is better than that. I think strange times better than triggered. And one of the things that over the last three or four years that have really concentrate on is this process. The process of organizing and being very meticulous about like how I structure

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       my material and then doing a lot of sets too. You got to do that and then fuck around and go on stage. Trump, I'd like to go on stage high. I like to fuck around because those are workout sets in, in, in those moments of chaos. Sometimes a thing will come out that wasn't there before. It just popped out of nowhere. And that motherfucker might be my. That might be my Bruce Jenner bit, that might be my closing bit in those bits are. They're rare, they're strange, they're theory theorial. They come out of the sky. You don't know where they're from. And you have to nurture that and that comes from chaos and that come that this is not necessarily a discipline thing. So there's the creativity in the madness has to sort of, they have to share space with the discipline they have to, they have to go back and forth with each other.

Speaker 2:          02:02:31       So we've always thought like, like people have always thought of Comedians as being like sad people are, drunks are messy, people are not disciplined, don't have their shit together. But why I don't think that's the case. Like I'm always going to be fucked up. Right. Okay. So how about I be fucked up, but I also keep it together, you know, so I always have these thoughts, you know, like I still have crazy thoughts. Like what? Like what's your, what are you, why are you fucked up? Like what are you, what's your fucked up thoughts for? Probably definitely have brain damage will probably definitely have like some sort of head trauma induced damage. I don't know what's going on. Does that manifest itself? I don't know. I'm sure sometimes. Yeah, really not totally like that, but also I work out so much that I drain all that shit out of my system. You meditate, right? Yes. I spent a lot of time doing the float tank too. I have a float tank right here. That helps a lot. Um, but I think that if I did slow down and you know, and people are like, oh, you're fucking work so much because you're afraid you're crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. What do you say, Samsung?

Speaker 4:          02:03:38       Only when I'm running I'm like, you're running. I'm forrest gump and right now I can, when I'm going through the worst times of my life, I could just run forever. And that's what, when you see old men running and you're like, what are you, why are you running from your running from something ever when you work out that much, you're running from something and mit to it. It's a, it's a great copay. It's better than drinking for me.

Speaker 2:          02:03:57       Well it, it, but it works. That's the thing. It does. Yeah. Like if you are crazy and you do it, like if you're a comedian, guests what? You're fucking crazy. If you're a good one. I've never met a good one. That's not crazy. I mean everybody's got their own crazy like howie mendell. As crazy as you can't touch people. You know, he's got to put paper towels on the ground every time he walks. Like when he goes to a hotel room, you know what he does is he lays out paper towels, a pathway to his bathroom, to the bed. Again, he won't touch people's hands. Severe Germaphobe, Super Nice Guy. The nicest guys you'll ever met. Meet. That's his crazy. His craziest different than you're crazy. You're crazy. Is Different than my crazy. To my crazy different than crystal. Leah's is crazy. Everybody's crazy. I know. Everyone's so crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:04:39       To be, to be good. You have to be. You have to embrace that. There's no way else your coming up with the kind of fucked up shit that you and I say onstage that you say in front of a bunch of people and then you hit it with a tagline and then take it to another place like there's no way your normal. There's no way it's not. It's not possible, but are we? Are we more crazy than the average person? Know that's the thing. We're just going everywhere. Everyone's fucking crazy. I bet less crazy than the average person because we're free to express ourselves. The average person has to live this fucking bizarre, contained life where you show up the same place everyday. Do something you don't want to do every day with a bunch of people you probably don't even like, and you're all backstabbing and weird with each other and you're just doing it for a paycheck.

Speaker 2:          02:05:29       You know, and you're, you're, you're, you're spending the majority of your time here on this heavenly body hurling through infinity, doing something you don't want to do. Yeah, that's more crazy what you and I are doing. At least we're doing something we love. And then that feeling that you get, I mean, I've seen you crush, right? You go on stage in the main room and you fucking crush and you say thank you goodnight. And everybody was like, that is that feeling of making all those people happy. Have they? They went out, they got babysitters, they got together, they dressed up, they went to dinner, they got to the comedy store or they ordered drinks. They sat down there and you fulfilled their expectations. You gave them what they wanted to see and I've seen you do it. And that feeling that you get when that happens, it's indescribable and drag you, your 300 people happy. You made them all laugh. I mean this, there's nothing like it on earth for us. I mean, don't you see people that never get to kill and you go, Oh, you poor pitch. Never get it to kill. He just go through your life as a doctor. You never get to kill, kill.

Speaker 4:          02:06:39       How do you go through life? He wanted to die. I was like on a path to like, I'll probably just kill myself some day if I don't find a purpose, and then killing gave me a purpose, kill. Going onstage. Killing on stage was like, okay, now I have a reason to live. That's like fucked up. It's fucked up. It's so fucked up. But it keeps me going and I and I get to continue to do it. It's fucked up some. It's a struggle to do and that's exciting. But don't you like the art of comedy? Like didn't you'd like it before you ever did it? Hell yes. The greatest. It's such a good. Yeah. I mean, but it just never seemed like an option to me. Like I didn't even like look at stand ups. Like, oh, that's something I could ever do and then get anybody does until you do it. There's some people that are like, I love what I grew up. All I did was a memorized comedy and I performed it for my class and I won't memorize people stand up. It was never even something I paid attention to until people were like, you should do it, and I paid attention to it. I could do routines and Conan and everything, but stand up. I was. I was never really aware of what w. What were you, what was your exposure to it early on?

Speaker 2:          02:07:44       Well, when I was about, I think I was 13 or 14, my parents took me to see live in the sunset strip. Yeah. It was a in the movie theater and it was Richard Pryor and it was absolutely the first time I'd ever seen anything like that. Cool parents. Oh yeah, hippies. Yeah, and that moment when I was in that audience watching that and in dying laughing and looking around, I remember I really, really distinctly remember looking, not just looking at the screen, but looking at all the people that were just like slapping the chair and moving around and holding their chest and thinking how insane is it that this guy can do this, that this guy can just talk and just through talking, he's, he's making me laugh way harder than any movie I'd ever seen in my life. And I think it came around.

Speaker 2:          02:08:34       I think that movie came out. I think live with the census came out around the same time as stripes, which is one of my all time favorite comedies. But I remember thinking, why isn't stripes as funny as that guy talking? How insane is this thing that this guy can do where he, he's just talking stripes. I'm watching all this stuff play out. There's texts and yeah, you know, and, but he's funnier than that. And I remember thinking he's Funnier than any movie that I've ever seen. Even in Richard Pryor movie, uh, Richard Pryor movie, like never as funny as him talking like him talking his way. Funniest thing, the funniest thing, a comic killing. Like I remember my friend Steve [inaudible], he said something about, uh, he went to see something about Mary and this was his instinct strip is his fucking old school Italian guy. He's a lawyer.

Speaker 2:          02:09:24       He was on the Sopranos. He, uh, he said he goes, it was as good as someone killing. That's what he said. He was as good as a comic killing. That's a funny. That movie is. I was like, wow, what a crazy statement. It's as good as a comic killing. Like it's universally accepted that if you go to see, you know, fill in the blank, Dave Chappelle, whoever it is, it's killing bill burr when they're on stage smashing that. That's probably the funniest thing you could ever experience. So the art form itself is to me like it's the craziest

Speaker 4:          02:09:58       it most craziest dynamic art forum that we stand up there with a microphone and talking to it. And that's all we have. There are times where I'm on stage, I'm like, what, how, how are you doing this? You have that moment that other people say to you all the time. It was like, how do you just, you know, musicians say they're like, I have a guitar and I get to sing and I rely on all these things use, have to talk and there's no other option for us. Like it's like that's all we've ever done, but it is a wild thing that we do.

Speaker 2:          02:10:26       It is. But you know, musicians have their own wildness. I mean, could you imagine? Oh God, no. Yeah, I'd,

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       no, because I have no skills.

Speaker 3:          02:10:36       I don't have it either, but I admire the shit out of it. One of the reasons why I admire it because I don't have it like a watch. Like I have friends that are musicians. I go to see them live and it's, it's so fulfilling to me because I have no talent. So like when I, when I watched them do it, I was like, this is amazing that they can do this. I can't do that. That's incredible. Like wow, when I go to see Cirque du Solei, I get the same feeling.

Speaker 4:          02:10:57       Wow. Doing dancing with the stars. I'm just like watching these dancers. Like how did you just do like that? That took me months to learn and you just taught it to this girl in three minutes for her to fill in for me to do the camera black. Like it was just like I couldn't get you. That is the thing of the wonder of like, I just can't. I don't even know what that's like to do. But I of course. Do you play an instrument? Do you have any musical ability? None. Zero. It was like you would know. I know. Doesn't it suck? Like want that? You don't want to.

Speaker 3:          02:11:25       I don't want to learn anything and I do too much shit already.

Speaker 4:          02:11:28       Yeah. You to where you don't need it.

Speaker 3:          02:11:30       I can't, I'm trying to manage my time. I'm just uh, yeah. Um, I'd have to manage my obsessions, but I think that what we are seeing, whether it's in music or in, you know what going to see a great comic or anything when you're seeing is these, these portals for expression and the more they concentrate on that portal for expression, whether it's dancing, whether it's musicians or even someone making a film, there's more they concentrate on those portals of expression. The better the message and the better the impact it's going to be for the people that are enjoying it. The people that watch it, and I think Paul Mooney told me that a long time ago when I was a young comic coming up and he was like the old sage at the comedy store. He goes, if you really want to get good accommodate, you want to go up and kill.

Speaker 3:          02:12:14       He goes, you should go get into tained. Go get entertained. I go, really? He goes, yeah. He goes, you know what I do? I go to see some music. I go to see a movie, I get entertained, I get entertained and I want to entertain. I was like, oh, that makes sense. Like you go see someone kick ass, right when you go see someone sing and it's fucking amazing and you're like, God that, that, that, that portal for expression, like they've honed whatever message that's going to go through that portal and it reaches you, you know, it's the result of hundreds of not thousands of hours of twisting and turning and hammering and sculpting and massaging and sanding, and then you get to see it in this finished form. Like awe inspiring.

Speaker 4:          02:12:59       Fuck yeah. Do you go see a lot of music and as much as I can, yeah, I do it on purpose. Like I try to be entertained on purpose. Are you saying that to me just now? It's like that I need to work harder at doing like it sounds stupid, but I need to go and enjoy myself and be entertained more. You're absolutely right because every time I do I walk away from it and I go and be a better comedian. I

Speaker 3:          02:13:21       think. Well, like I said, he told me that in the nineties and he's just such a wise man and when, when he told me that I remember thinking like, God fucking totally completely makes

Speaker 2:          02:13:31       and I think um, we don't do enough of that. And also I think if you just do only comedy in your round comedy all the time, we didn't get too wrapped up in it. You get to in your own head and you, it takes away a little bit of your ability to be free.

Speaker 4:          02:13:45       Yeah. I, I, I don't, I don't seek out comedy. I've seen enough of it, but movies and I went to a musical last week at forced myself to go, just watch people be great at that. And it was, I left feeling good. It's good to do. It's hard to do though. Like to watch a movie. I feel accomplished at the end of it. Like I read a book, that's how, that's where I've gotten to now if it's a good movie,

Speaker 2:          02:14:08       you know, if you see something that's like, like x mocking. I was like one of my favorite movies of all time, but I remember seeing that movie and getting out of there going, God damn it. I want to make something like that. Something that when I leave I go, fuck. That was good. God Damn. They nailed it. You know like when when something comes together like that, I think it gives you just a little bit of juice. Music definitely does that to me. Like I'll play like a five. There's a song that really cracks with me. I'll play that motherfucker on repeat in the background while I write. I'll just, I'll just one song just over and over again and all the songs sort of like fades into the background and just gives you energy. Once you hear it like two or three times, like the words don't mean anything anymore and then it just becomes like this fucking this power supply.

Speaker 2:          02:14:56       Have you done the Goddamn comedy jam? And like, Nah, no interest. Interesting. Bill was trying to get me this thing the other day. He's like, you should do it because if I was him and Dean del Rey, the what they do is they go to a venue, like he played the forum last week. Yeah. So they get there 2:00, set up the drums and the guitar and the amps and then they play to no audience. They jammed all day. He played from two to 6:30. Fat Fun. Yeah. They're playing, they're having fun. And then you go on later that night and you know, you've just free.

Speaker 4:          02:15:30       Yeah. I rented a karaoke room for my birthday and I just sang Taylor swift songs the whole time and had my friends are held captive. They didn't even, they got the same one or two songs but we only had it for an hour because I had to go do sets that night and I just sang. I just performed Taylor swift to them because I want to be Taylor swift and it was so fun. I was like, I should do this more often by myself just to sing, to attract and retain and pop star for an hour. That is. So that is such. That's so cool that they did that.

Speaker 2:          02:15:57       Yeah. I think just having funds important because doing things that are fun, you know, like you, I think you could definitely get too distracted when you're not concentrating on what you should be doing, but I also think you could get too focused where you lose track of what it is. Like what is that?

Speaker 4:          02:16:13       What do I do for fun anymore? I've had to ask myself that and I'm currently asking myself that and like, what did, I don't know. I mean running, but does that count sometime? I love it every day. It's something that, it's, that it's a hobby. Sure.

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       Why wouldn't account because it's like you. Because it's a thing that people are like, oh, I kind of feel like it's a chore kind of working on is something will look as a chore. Yeah. It isn't any more. To me, meditation might be a hobby, but that's more of a practice that I like. It's like brushing my teeth. So I wouldn't say brushing my teeth as a hobby. Um, no, and I need more. But you've always had hobbies has you've always like martial arts. Did that turn into a hobby for you as soon as you started doing comedy or did you have to like Kinda get back into it? Not,

Speaker 3:          02:17:03       never stopped. It's always been just, it's almost like a big part of my philosophy, like who I am. It's never stopped because, you know, I started working for the UFC in 1997. That's when I started doing post fight interviews and I was still very involved in martial arts then. That's what I was just starting to learn Jujitsu. Uh, so it was in involved in a new martial art for me. And then, um, I've never stopped. I've always done something and I've never stopped paying attention to it or studying it or learning new moves or paying attention to the new trends or you know, watching fights or you know, and especially things that I don't necessarily practice as much. I'm interested in that, like watching different things that people do.

Speaker 5:          02:17:46       What's the last hobby you picked up? Bow Hunting and you're like, you love it. Really?

Speaker 3:          02:17:53       What's a. to me it's a, it's, it's going to sound ridiculous, but it's a, it's a spiritual way to achieve your food, to get meat and spiritual sounds ridiculous to people like, Oh, you're shooting an Arrow and an animal. You have to be so finely tuned with your senses in your skills and your abilities and there's so much consequence on the line if you fuck up. And then the pressure is so immense that to me it's almost cleansing and its intensity and that, uh, I think doing difficult things makes, doing other difficult things, uh, better. Not Easier, but you're get better at it. You get, you understand, like I think if you put yourself in a situation, this happens to certain comedians, they get really good, they get really famous and then they only perform for their crowd and they get soft. I think we've all seen them.

Speaker 3:          02:18:48       You've all seen them. They start to suck. They start to do, they're, they're committing, their comedy gets soft and they become like a, almost like someone doing an impression of them. They lose their edge. And I think one of the ways to keep your edge is to always be scared. So always do something that scares the shit out of you. Always do something that's nerve wracking. Always do something that's difficult. Whether it's a martial art or it's learning to dance or learning an instrument or there's something that's something hard for bill bird does. He flies helicopters, he plays the drums. I think things like that. I think those are critical. I think you need differently and it almost like she'd be thought of as like a protocol, like, like cross that you're

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       not just going to do your discipline but you're also going to be involved in other, um, other disciplines that they add to what you're doing. Yeah. I think that's what you're hitting on. Exactly why I said Yes to dancing with the stars, which dancing is the thing that I'm know that I'm worst at was because it's like that's the scariest thing to me. And if I do that then I can do so many other things. And I'm also scared of that. I'm not as scared of as dancing. Like it's really weird. But like I like I'm, I've talked a lot about sex. I'm into like, I want to do weird sex things in my life that I haven't done. Like I want to go to sex clubs, I want to have threesomes. I've, I'm pretty vanilla. Even though my sex club [inaudible] club is the other people in the sex club there also there.

Speaker 5:          02:20:15       Yeah. No, that's not the problem for me. Weirdos chosen on your feet and chill. They're not. It's all very consensual and it's all very. I just want to study that. I know enough going in like I'm ready for it now because I did dancing with the stars. I'm like, oh, I could go have a threesome, go to have a threesome 100 percent. And I was not before because I always wanted to say I've done a threesome. I've always wanted that experience to talk about. It seems like an interesting thing. What do you want to do a threesome with two dudes? Or do you want to do a threesome with a girl guy? I mean, I would, I would prefer for my own, like I would like more dudes than women because I'm just not like making out in front of you. You'd be like, it has to be about me. I have to be like, they have to be mostly into me, but I can. I don't mind a little bit of gayness going on. Like I don't. I think we're all very fluid or whatever, but good luck with that thought.

Speaker 5:          02:21:07       I am totally like if a guy has kind of gay, but it's like enough end to me, I'm fine with it. If you have sex and in your life you can. I can tell you I don't care. Isn't Rni cool? How many dicks sexual if you like, equal dicks to pussies. I don't care as long as you're very into my pussy while it's in front of you. Is that rare though? That seems rare. It seems like most girls would be skeeved out. I think that is rare. No, I think it's rare, but I think it shouldn't be. I think that why shouldn't it be like whatever you liked. Like if you're just in a totally straight men, there's nothing wrong with that. As long as you're not homophobic, bisexual, a phobic to the point where you judge them and you hate them, but you shouldn't have to like them.

Speaker 5:          02:21:51       Well, okay. Here's, I don't think that. I don't think that liking Dick makes you like pussy any less. If you also, if you're bisexual, it's not like you have an amount of liking other people's body parts to give out and you're giving half of that to Dick's and half of that to put these. I think you can like them both equally and be as excited by them in front of you. I never met anyone like that. I've, I've met bisexual men who like you like them equally. I don't really totally believe, but it was just a good joke that I kind of believe that I, I,

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       I believe in gay women but. And I believe in bisexual women, but I think there's two types of gay men, I think. I don't necessarily believe in bisexual men. I think there's gay men and then there's really gullible, straight dudes who get talked into blow and crafty gay.

Speaker 5:          02:22:49       I think that those things do exist real. There's definitely some gullible, straight dudes, but I do think there are really bisexual men. I'm just as just a joke. Of course that's just a joke, but I do. I think you're right. Those do exist like straight men who have been and who will live with that secret and I walked around Travolta's massage therapists

Speaker 5:          02:23:10       allegedly just to show you a good guy. Yeah, I'm into. I don't, I, I think that if I'm not like I don't look at women and go like, I want to fuck her, but if a girl was like super into me, I could totally date someone and fall in love with someone and like be in a romantic, sexual relationship with a girl. That would be just as gratifying as with a man because you would have to be. So you have to be into me. Like I think that's the thing that I'm into. Men that aren't in a certain way to certain lesbian, like a dude energy. Like I'm arnold energy or is looking for a woman of energy. They were like down vests when it's just a little too warm out for the best. Yeah. I kinda lesbians women because they're just like, I just like a woman who just lumberjacky I like to be pursued.

Speaker 5:          02:24:06       So any kind of energy you give me, like where you're like I want you and I'm coming after you and I'm not going to really take no for an answer. Not in a rapey way. We all know, but like I do like the energy of a sick woman with a big neck. I like a feminine looking. I like anytime a woman, but I think it's an energy. But yeah, like I've met women in rose type character. I mean that's. Everyone's like, yeah, that would be nice. But it's what everyone wants. No, I mean Jennifer Aniston is my favorite part. Like she is like the hospital. If she's like, I know what's wrong with you.

Speaker 2:          02:24:40       Me. This is why I can't settle down with a dude.

Speaker 5:          02:24:43       Oh God, yes. Like Nikki glaser. Oh my God, I would you be into that for real? Wow. If she was into me, but if it was like if she was like, I'm going to try this out, then no, but if she was like, I'm want this girl and I'm going to come after her. Oh yeah. They had a lesbian relationship before? No, not even close, but I didn't make. I make it. I made out with most girl. I mean it was like all my girlfriends before I ever kissed a guy because I was so scared of boys that I. The first time I got drunk I made it with all of my girlfriends because we wanted to kiss boys, but we didn't have boys around who liked us. That's the difference in girls and boys. Guys don't ever do that. Oh, they just don't talk about it. Show. Oh they do that they

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       can make out with each other. I think so. How many guys, if you had like 10 guys in a room, how many guys do you think have made out with their buddies?

Speaker 5:          02:25:30       I'm not kidding you. I think for at a 10 guys have done some gay stuff early on before they had a chance to do it with women straight men who identify as straight.

Speaker 2:          02:25:39       You are dealing with a severely impaired sample,

Speaker 5:          02:25:43       like whatever, whatever semi homo energy you're attracting, these are all the Cymbalta dot put. Poor John Travolta. It's just a joke. Just a joke, John

Speaker 2:          02:25:59       the. I don't think that's the number. I mean I think it's probably like, what is the, what is, what's the standard accepted number of homosexuals in a population? Is it one on one time? So real. I think it's like $10. It would be so many more to stop and think about that. Right? There's 20 million people in Los Angeles. You think one out of 10? I think there's 200,000. Wait, no, that would be like wait, 20 million people. One that's two. That's 2 million people. Okay. Um, that is a lot of gates. A lot of homos. You could still say homo. You can definitely still say, ah, you fucking homos. Enjoy it while you can. Dangerous saying fucking homeless. It's like there's an aggression to it. You beautiful home that he can say, all right, hey, respects us. What are the numbers? What numbers of gays broken down by? Yeah, but how many closeted gays see the problem that I know so many closeted gay guys and there's steps. There's several stages to that. There's closeted gays that are out to their friends, which I have friends that are closeted gay, that are out to their friends, but they're in the business and so they're closeted, but then there's closeted even to their friends. I have. I have one friend in particular. You know who you are, motherfucker.

Speaker 5:          02:27:13       No, sorry. Okay. It's a six percent of women or five percent of women. Five point one percent of them and three point nine percent of men that are identifying. So then let's round up a little bit. Yeah. Well, how much will we round up? I got around up at least a percentage of more. So we're. We're dealing with a five percent, I think five percent. If you're rounding up five percent, then we're looking at 10 percent joe.

Speaker 2:          02:27:41       No, it's three. Oh, what do you mean?

Speaker 5:          02:27:43       So five percent of women identify in three point nine percent of men. So if you're rounding up, if you're doubling that, what you're saying, rounding up five percent or you're running a five percent of the percent were both back. It's been clearly established. I think, uh,

Speaker 2:          02:27:59       you're safe if they're saying it's three percent, I think it's probably five percent.

Speaker 5:          02:28:04       Okay. Oh, I see what you're saying. You're rounding up one percent? Yes. Okay. Then that's what St I think it's about. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:28:09       probably, maybe even more because there's such a stigma whenever there's a stigma to something is always going to be a bunch of people that are just in denial of it and just they're sad that they are, you know, a lot of that. There was a guy that I used to know and uh, he was a comic and he used to have the most ruthlessly homophobic material. It was awful. It was awful. Like he used to do, like he used to God he to do these really mean nasty jokes about gay guys. And then uh, I moved out here to la and then somebody said, hey, did you hear that guy's gay? I went, what? He goes, yeah, he finally came out. I'm like, get the fuck Outta here. And then uh, go back home, went back to Boston and then all of a sudden he's like a big old queen. It's like he just, he was just keeping it in the poor bastard,

Speaker 4:          02:29:01       you know? And then that's, it happens all the time. The guys, when guys have acts where I watch on stage and they're just, they hate women so much. That's not so much hating gay people but hating women in a way that they're like a lot of guys that um, I have, I have a lot. I used to hate my vagina a lot because I would hear guys talk about like beef curtains or voguing Derby's five for $5 and I have like one of those vagina's right? So I have like more, I have like a, like not like, it's not like hanging down to my knees, but like I have a, I don't have a pussy you see in porn. Like I like, I don't want to like a perfect little designer batch and I used to be really insecure about it because I used to hear guys say like too many lips down there, it's gross and I think that a lot of guys that have that kind of mentality about postseason and say that they're gay and I would be disgusted with pussy too. I would have that like, oh, it looks like a Rosebud. I would act that way too if I were a gay man that if I had to do something that I didn't really want to be doing by nature. So that's where I think that comes from sometimes being. So when I see when I see a guy on stage just say like really disgusting things about women and just hate women and I'm just like

Speaker 6:          02:30:15       gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:30:20       Do you remember like what I was going to bring up that. What is his name? Ted? Uh, we talked about a meal a day on the podcast. I used to have a whole bit about them from ninth, 2009 that my butt's special. No, no, he was the famous preacher, Ted Haggard, Ted Haggard who was just fucking rabidly gay, turned out he was smoking meth and having gay sex with prostitutes, and then the outer did. I'm on CNN, the gay prostitute was like, I suck your Dick, and we smoked crack together, and he was like, but that's what it is. Like these guys, they hate what they are and there's so many of these anti gay politicians that turned out to begin with so many of them.

Speaker 4:          02:31:00       It's almost a go the other way because you were just telling us who you are and this is how many times they don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:31:07       I think the thing about people that are living a lie is that they're always living in that lie and they can't see truth because they're spouting. I think if you lie all the time, like you're always not yourself in an honest way. You get super confused and you don't know what it is. It's like

Speaker 4:          02:31:25       comics who steal jokes can't write jokes. You ever noticed that there's no. Comics is steal jokes that right. Amazing. Right. Amazing jokes and they don't do both. Do both. You do one or the other, right? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:31:38       because to be living in that lie like, Oh yeah, I thought of that. That's my joke. Like you're constantly justifying it and living in your head like that. Those comics, when they're, when they get out it and they're forced to write their own material, they fucking suck. They suck. Like, like a joke, like an open mic or something. Like someone who doesn't know how to do comedy and they could have been doing comedy for 10, 15 years, but you'll see their material and compare it to the jokes they stole.

Speaker 4:          02:32:07       Wow. You're so right. To live a lie that to steel material, you can't be actually a creative genius person in another way. What's a totally different? It's a different. You're different. You're not a comedian. You're a thief. You're a magician. You're doing something, you're doing, you're an actor, you're a liar. You're a liar. Not the same thing. So the opposite. It's so interesting to take that away from them and then they'd. We've seen it. Yes.

Speaker 2:          02:32:37       So mentioning names, we've seen it and when you see it it's super obvious and they get terrible as they get older, as they get further along in their career, instead of getting better, they get

Speaker 4:          02:32:46       way worse. It's so weird when you're like, we've all been accused of stealing material because there's one tweet that someone did and it's like, well that's a similar thought. And it's like, well it's a parallel thought. Idiots. Like always parallel thought was a joke theat when I've been accused of stealing land. It's like, why? So then all of my stuff is stolen because why would I do that? Why would it take that one? Do I really need that that badly that I would steal it? And then all this other stuff is original. Then all of my stuff is probably stolen. Right?

Speaker 2:          02:33:14       And when that some. One of the weird things that you do find out when you find out that someone's a thief, then then someone starts going through their material and comparing it to all these other comedians. You Holy Shit, like look at all this, all my God. And then look at that time. It has a bit from mad tv or that's a cosby bit. Oh my God, and then you see like most of their thoughts, they've somehow or another pilfered from someone else and just sort of repackaged

Speaker 4:          02:33:40       and that's a different kind of talent. I'm almost like, okay, I respect that you were able to have that room is going for that long. That's like a different kind of. You're just a kid imagined that being that much of a. just waiting for someone to pull up that youtube clip, but they must not. I don't think they. I don't think they think about. They can't possibly think about that. I mean, when I used to, when I used to shoplift, I was worried about getting caught. Yeah. Oh yeah. I was addicted. Shoplift like noses while you're anorexic. Big Time. Oh. I was like, I was addicted to it. I didn't even want it to

Speaker 2:          02:34:16       keep yourself from about the fact that you were really skinny.

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       I was shoplifting to stop from thinking about how I was hungry or that I was hated myself for. It was just a high. I would get like getting things and I would steal things that I didn't want, that I didn't like, that I would never wear, that I just wrote this because I could write. Yeah. And I always knew I would get caught and I knew that I had to get caught to quit, but I wanted to keep going as long as I could. And then I got caught and I never shoplifted again after getting caught. But like I remember getting caught and being like, I knew I needed to get caught. Thank you. Like I'll never do it again. And she was like, I'm fucking tired of this shit and screaming at me. She was like a couple of years older than me. It was an urban outfitters in Lawrence, Kansas I was on, was on a break from work and I just went over to do some light shoplifting and I got caught on the way out.

Speaker 4:          02:35:03       The beeper went off. It was so embarrassing because she went through my bag and she goes, really? The shirt? This is disgusting. And she was like cooler than me. It was so humiliating on every level and every I was wearing my uniform from my restaurant job where I worked next door and it was urban outfitters that was the only cool place to shop in my college town and she was like, your band for three years. I'm like this, the rest of college, so I'd have to go in and disguises to actually purchase things because that was banned. But I, I never shoplifted again, but I remember guys, this is where I would just like wear sunglasses and a scarf and like Eddie Murphy when he put on the fast shallow. Uh, yeah, I, I, but I, but being someone who stole things, like I knew that I would get caught and I wanted to get caught because it's a terrible life. Do you think these people want to get caught?

Speaker 2:          02:35:57       No. No, I think they just want to kill him. They get addicted to killing. You know, one of the things that happens, like when someone gets caught stealing or we're just talking about this the other day, was that when someone gets caught stealing and then you call them on and they said, I won't do that again, and then he's here. Hey you here. He just did that your bit at the laugh factory like that motherfucker. He said he would stop doing it. Aren't they? Get addicted to killing you. Addicted to it.

Speaker 4:          02:36:23       Imagine being having that taken away from you. That's what I keep thinking about with comedians that have had, did not go on stage anymore because something happens. Obviously the me too. Stuff that's happened. I like, there's a part of me that's like, what if someone said I couldn't go on stage for a year. Like I was banned. Like Richard's. Well yeah, like forever, like he's basically been forever. I don't know what I do if I couldn't do standup at night and like I'm not jerking off in front of people. So like, I'm not at risk of losing that right now, but like I don't think he thought he was at risk of losing that. Do you think like it was just a matter of time? I mean, I know that maybe towards the end when everything was kind of blowing up around him with other men that he was maybe worried about it, but like, do you think he wouldn't? Years of like, I hope this doesn't come back?

Speaker 2:          02:37:11       Probably. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's um, you know, that's a weird one. That's because that's one that you liked. How do you describe that? I mean, how do you, how do you defend that? Like you really can't. It's just a weird one. It's just, it's not the worst one because I'm into jerking off in front of women. I don't know why. It's my thing. I'm listening to Jim Norton. Jim Norton should to. This is attorney. He should've done a press conference and Jim Norton should've been as attorney. They would have fucking clear that thing up in a heartbeat. Jim Norton was said, well I, I jerk off in front of women as well, but a lot of times they have dicks and that's what I'm into. And like, I mean, yeah, Norton is so free because he talks about his, he, he hose into trannies and like that. That's his thing and you know, a lot of training anymore by the way. Oh that's right, that's right thing. But he can still say it because he's into them. It no one even calls him out on it. They just let it slide. That's. He really does.

Speaker 4:          02:38:14       He does so much for the community. Yeah. I don't really know. I think he's talked about liking having people shit on him. Like he puts down a tarp before women come over sometimes like seven women piston his mouth. Remember reading his books like early on in college and being like, I can't believe this man talking so openly about this, but thank God for him. There's nothing. He's not worried about anything coming back to haunt him.

Speaker 2:          02:38:36       No. He's so brave because the fact that he's so ruthlessly honest like that and loved for it, you know,

Speaker 4:          02:38:42       storm rain, him talking about blowing another kid underneath the porch as a kid. That was, I mean, people now talk openly about being molested or having weird sexual experiences with boys early on and it's more of like an okay thing. When Jim Norton was doing it back in 2002, no one talked about that shit and it was an joked about it. Yeah. And was beloved by ONA fans for us. I mean he was someone that early on I was like, I, this is different to me and I love it and I want to be on the other side of this where I can talk about all this stuff too and not, oh, that's interesting because there's so much freedom and being able to be like, yeah, I blew a kid under a porch when I was a kid. Yeah. There's nothing wrong with I was a kid. And being yourself, being yourself, being honest. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:39:27       And you find that when you are yourself, so as you're not hurting anybody, you, when you are yourself, you find people actually love you for it. Yes. Yeah. And they love the fact that you can be so brave that you can talk about all the different things that you love that other people might be scared of admitting. Yes. Just like that. Like his love of transgender women. Like think of that. Like if that came out about someone who's trying to hide that it would be devastating to them. But to him it's just like he, he'll just talk about it openly and laugh about it, you know? And it's not a point of contention at all. It's not something he's ashamed of. It's just who he is.

Speaker 4:          02:40:08       I know I've, I've him and there. There's several other people though, but just to. I remember Sarah Silverman or hearing her talk about being a bed wetter and I was, that was like my biggest shame for so long. And then I was just like, oh, okay, well then that, then it's okay. Just that all it took was one cool woman to say she did something embarrassing and I was like, okay, it's acceptable now. Now I can talk about it. And so that's why I talk about like, I like anal sex. I don't think that it's a cool thing. I'm not saying that like I, I'm not trying to put that out there as like nih naughty and don't you want to fuck me? Like that's not my intention with it even though people will put that on me sometimes, but it's because you should try it. It feels good and I want to put it out there to women. Like it's, it actually, like I want to just more people to experience it and not be scared of it. And it is gross and it is scary and it is weird, but like I talk openly about it because I hope that if you are a girl that's into it, you're not ashamed of being into it. Or if you're a guy that's into it, you're not, you're going to have a threesome with. I honestly, I will listen.

Speaker 5:          02:41:16       Do you think you would be excited about a dude but fucking a dude who's fucking you? Like have you got some sort of human centipede thing going?

Speaker 4:          02:41:23       Um, no because I don't think he could focus on me if he was

Speaker 5:          02:41:26       penetrated himself and it would be more about taking it for a year in the past. I think that is so amazing. I think it's because of you might be the Dick in my ass. I'm not sure. No, I couldn't stand that. I would need more focus on trading on you

Speaker 4:          02:41:48       two thrusts. One back be concentrating on both. Focused on me. I need to be the focal focal point. If I'm going to be in one of these things, which I think you can arrange that. Good luck. Good luck. Arranging what people are going to focus on. Oh, that's a good point. But that's, that's the thing that I was fearing of doing a threesome is like what if I get in it and like what if I had to go down on a girl and like I'm doing it and I'm like it's bad pussy or something. Or it's like, what a bad pussy, what's bad pussy?

Speaker 4:          02:42:24       What if, what if I just don't like pussy, but what's possible? When I did dancing with the stars, I really came out of it being like, I'm ready to eat some pussy now because I faced my fear of dancing in front of millions of people, which is like the scariest thing I've ever done on live TV. Anything go wrong. And now I'm like, what's, why am I so scared of a threesome? Because I think my thing about threesomes, I'm going to get into it and I'm going to be like, I don't want to be here and that I'll still have to go through with it. But like, no, it won't. What I like, I changed my mind, which I do all the time now with hookups. I think that as a woman we are so conditioned to think that men have to come at the end of it.

Speaker 4:          02:43:03       There's the thing called blue balls and like in that if you've, if you've made out with a guy and gotten a loan with a guy that and you've decided to hook up with a guy and you're like, I'm getting naked a guy, you have to go through the whole thing until he orgasms. Like that is what, that is what we are sold because men put that pressure on you. It's not men, it's women, it's magazines, it's TV tell you you have to make them come with like 5,000 ways to blow his mind and to do this with a feather. You know, that kind of keep coming up with those lists. I mean, it's all the same episodes. How many issues have been made? I mean it's the same thing with workouts. The last ab workout you'll ever need. Well then you better not tell me another one because you just said this is the last one on eight. Even though you'll say that next year too. So there's endless things, but I. But my new thing is now, like when I used to be so scared of hooking up with guys because I was like, if I agree to kiss a guy alone in a room, then I'm probably agreeing to have sex with him and then I don't even want to put myself in that scenario, so I just didn't even kiss boys.

Speaker 2:          02:44:04       See, that's something that a man doesn't have to fear. Right. If a man is alone with a woman and he's making out with her in a room, he doesn't think like, oh my God, I have to satisfy her. She's going to be mad at me.

Speaker 4:          02:44:13       Yeah. And it, it, it's not even about like it is, it is exactly what you're saying because I want to backtrack and say it's not about like he's going to force me to have sex with them. It's like he's going to be mad or disappointed in me and he's just going like, he's just going to be mad and I don't want a guy to be mad at me. Right. And so I always had an unpleasant experience for the other person. Exactly. You just don't, you just want to be nice and accommodating and that's what I felt always felt like if, if I, if I make out with a guy I have so many times in my life, been making out with a guy and been said in my head like, what's the least second day to make this guy come? Like, what, what, what can I do that is gonna make me feel the least bad about myself or like something I, what do I want to, what can I do to make what, how can this guy get off and I can leave feeling good about myself and like I didn't do something I didn't want to do.

Speaker 4:          02:45:07       Which a lot of times you do something you don't want to do. It has happened to me. I do. I call rape on it. Do I look back on that guy and go, he raped me know. Do you think that the thought I was into it,

Speaker 2:          02:45:17       do you think the solution to that is way, way longer before you get intimate with someone? Like get to know them really well?

Speaker 4:          02:45:23       No, I think the solution is educating women and telling them that it's okay if a guy doesn't come and it is okay the second year, like I'm not really feeling this,

Speaker 2:          02:45:30       that's the case for sure, but I mean personally for you to not be in that situation like no a guy really well before you're intimate with them because isn't that part of the problem is a lot of times people get intimate with someone, especially if alcohol's involved. You get intimate with someone before you know them and then you may be in the situation and you're like, this is not what I wanted and now I feel gross and I want to get out of here. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:45:53       I think, yeah, that's part of it and to not. I think it really is though as a woman, just being able to be, say, make the situation uncomfortable by being like, I'm done here. I'm so sorry I'm not going to come and either so neither are you and maybe we'll do this again sometime. I've done that recently, like the lady who's in charge of the audition. Thank you Nikki. I really reached that point with myself though. We're a much. I did that to someone recently. I was literally hooking up with them and I was like, I just, I think this is it. This is going to be like, and it was, but here's my thing is like more. I hate being this woman that, but if I'm going to get anything across to your listeners because it's. I sound like a hack eighties female comic right now, but like more foreplay, like I never thought I'd be a woman that says that just like we need.

Speaker 4:          02:46:50       I couldn't always be convinced to have sex with you. If I'm willing to make out with you, then I am what I am. Somewhere in the realm of things, and I'm not giving this to every woman, but for me, I am willing to take a good decade from you. You have that opportunity. If I'm making out with you. Yes. Convince me, turned me on. Don't just try to stick your Dick in me right after making out. That's not going to be the way to fuck me. Sometimes I think I know where she says no, why? They're panicked, but before she says, no, no, you have all this time to get me to say yes. Some people are panickers just we need to bring back dry humping. It is so hot to the point where I'm so revved up that I'm like, I need it like girls or I want.

Speaker 4:          02:47:39       Because you know what it feels like to get fingered when you're not turned on. It feels like the way it feels when a girl, when a girl grabs your deck and you're not hard, you know that feeling where you're like, oh no, no, no, too early. Don't do it. Don't do it yet. Let me just get. That's the way it feels. When a guy goes to finger you and you're not wet, you're like, I could get there, but now I'm not going to because now I'm insecure that I'm not wet and now it's like I just want to cut this thing so don't touch us there until we're like, please like until we take your hand and do it. That is, if you get us there, which you will by doing all the other stuff, dry humping over the pants stuff, a feeling. Our tits kissing, kissing, get us revved up and we will ask you to.

Speaker 4:          02:48:23       We will beg you to fuck us. You should give a seminar. I like, this is like, you feel that I feel like you're onstage in front of a large audience telling people how to do this. I really, I could, I want to give like sex ted talks because I think that I could get men and women to have more sex and enjoy it more because I've just given this stuff so much thought. But I, I really hate being the girl to say more. Yeah, I do. I talk about this a lot. I'm just starting to get into this area. This is, this seems like it's ripe for material. Oh Man. It's, it's just true. And, and um, I'm also telling guys in the audience who I might fuck, like I'm hoping that there's a guy in the back of the room that I'm into. You know, I've done that before where there was a guy I'm crushing on and I know he's in the room and I'm like, here's the.
