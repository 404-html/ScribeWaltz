Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I get me all the time. I'm more famous than them. I, I wish we could tell you what we were talking about. Uh, and uh, yeah, we were talking about Joey getting in trouble though. He just texted me about it. How's Joey Diaz get in trouble with what? The MMA community MMA outlets. They have nothing to do. Well, here's the thing though. I see where they're coming from. They're journalists. If someone says something that fucking outrageous about what Mackenzie Durans derriere must, uh, he said, I think your ass smells great. Right? Like something along those lines. You're talking about the comic. Uncle Joey said this, Joey, but I get it. I get where they would and then Vinny Magallanes backed him up. I get it packed up Joey. Yeah, backed up. Joey says tasty too. Yikes. Yeah. Yikes. I get it. I don't get it. That's a Joey Diaz, the great comic who's commenting on a hot girl in the UFC. He is not a writer and he's not a journalist. These writers have nothing to do. So they're like, how can we get hits? Let's talk about Joey Diaz cause no one's reading any of our shit. I agree with you somewhat, but he definitely did do it. Like it ain't a bat. Here's my thing. They could say whatever they want about what he said, but if he was your friend and he texted you that you would do what I did cause I'll show you. He fucking texted me that before. Tweet.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       Of course I love the Joey texts now. Joey never would text message. Oh I hope he doesn't keep your ideas as a full on. Texted me. He still calls though last week. Most of the time he calls. But um, he texted me. Uh, yeah, it's Julie Diaz, man. Sorry folks. I wish I could let you in. You can go Google what he said. I'll try and be respectful. It's Joey Diaz. He can say whatever he wants. He doesn't work for the UFC. He's not, he's not your, you're right. I'm glad he does. I'm glad he does think like that. How do you know, send me texts like that. But if I was a news website and it was going to report out to, first of all, you want to plates read. Yeah, went cliff for sure. That's what they want, but also anybody who reads that are you really?

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       You're either going to be like me or you're like you're going to start laughing or you're going to get really upset, really upset and you're not a Joey Diaz fan anyway. It doesn't matter. He's happy with that. 95% of that is dude's read and I'm like, that's hilarious. The 5% of like, what the hell? What are we doing? How could you report this? Yeah, I think that's a good number. 95 95% of duty. That's hilarious. I was wondering the same thing. Some women will get upset though and rightly so if just to imagine if you were a dude and there were some big Ole giant Alexander Corel and looking dude who wanted to fuck you and he was always making jokes about what your butthole must smell like. They just stop. Just stop and think of what that would feel like. That wouldn't be a good time.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       If you're Mckenzie, if you're anybody that someone is saying those things about right, I would just be just trying to be open mind because you're not, you're being a little bit turns social justice. I'm fucking count. I came out, I just, I'll feel, but what I'm saying is if you look at it from the position of the person, the person who's buttholes in question, that would be an uncomfortable position to PN. Right? Bunch of people talking about what your butthole smelled like. We just trying to make a living on TV. I just tried to make a living. Just tried to trick a girl. He'll let that. It's also Joey Diaz being complimentary. It'd be one thing if she was not an attractive female or something like that and she's obviously very attractive, which is what makes this funny. I agree 100% I agree. Now if he tweets out, I wonder what black beast asshole smells like some like that to fully redeem himself.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       That's funny too. I don't know. He might. He might. Yeah. I don't know if he can get away with that. You might just to throw it up there to give those cheeto finger something to write about. Joey's coming on with EOL or Merrill. I cannot wait for that. I cannot, it's going to be a complete, that's the craziest podcast ever. They're going to talk in in a Cuban and I mean speak Spanish obviously. Then go back and forth trends go English and whatever. Whatever he can't get Joey's going to help him out with, you know, like if I'm, if I talk too fast or if I say something he doesn't understand, Joey's going to jump in and they're going to go away. It's going to be awesome. It could be off. Some are complete shit. You probably can be awesome. Yes. See, be awesome with you and Joey.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       Joey's just, he's a great entertainer. I people don't understand like part of the reason why he's so funny is he knows what's in attaining for you Kirk. He knows. He knows how to be the life of the party. Like no one counts. Pretty God damn good at it too. Calvin's up there. Calcan entertainer room count can take over Rome and, and with some of the brings to the party. I think that's his best art form. I've told them that. I think that your best art form is like inappropriate comedy around people who are trapped. Correct. Stuck at a party. So Jay, you're out of plane with them or something and he can't go anywhere. He's the funniest person I've, he's made me laugh harder offstage that almost sandy buddy. It's so rude. He's right there. He's right up there offstage with Joey. But onstage, Joey's just, he's on governmental, especially right now. He's on another planet. All accounts fucking hilarious on stage too. But Joey right now, Jesus Christ Callen just did his, uh, like a showcase at the Improv. How'd that go? You know, and I've heard and murdered. I kill.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       That's good. I've been hearing good things. That's good. Yeah. That club is a not a, not a bad club to work at now. I wish they would get rid of that stupid fucking piano on stage though. That doesn't make any sense to me. Piano was weird and Brian makes the same joke about every time. It's hilarious. Yeah. I won't say what it is. There's, there's a part where you're standing, especially if you go anywhere back on the stage where the people that are on the right side of the stage, like if you're facing the audience, you're right. Those people can't see you can't shame. And there's not a lot of room either is strange. It's stupid phrases. Does anyone get on this fucking, I dunno man. We should have a carrot top or some shit. Why? No Craig Robinson does on occasion. Craig's own though. Yeah. Usually has his electric piano.

Speaker 2:          00:06:41       Denny, maybe Owen Benjamin Ohn Benjamin can play the fuck out of a piano lesson. The moral of the story is no one's really using that. Even has a nick easy like huge penis was like a website that he had or something. Cause he's a giant dude. Uh, nobody's using that fucking get rid of it. Get rid of it. I want it. Doesn't need it. Like most places don't need God damn piano. That's so old school. But just in the way it's an hindrance. It's taking away from the show. I really believe it takes away from the show. Can you name any other club with a piano on stage? Not Rarely. It's hard to think. It's just a stupid thing to have, but also look what the comedy store is doing and then do the Robinson with his own fucking keyboard. You're right. Yeah. It usually comes out with his own shit. Yeah. He's probably got a bunch of shit. Oh sweater thing. Right? Look at him. I bet he DZA GJS Dj's the fuck out of a party. He does look like a mean Dj. He does. Right. You know who else Djs is? Shack. If since shack like straight up DJ his giant ass. Is it real Jay? Yeah, that's what he does like in his office. Got Platinum records, multiple p a DJ. I was a rapper. No, that diesel CD went platinum and he's got two I got to have, I have one of them that's amazing returns.

Speaker 2:          00:07:55       I saw some video of him Dj and it's like thousands of people like kids just jamming out obviously high off their ass on x e but it looked like a good time. That's what he does. Why Not mad? Why not? So Peter's is legit Dj legit legit friends with all the old school rappers like big Daddy Kane and shit. I had no idea dude. Russell is seriously legit. Like when we had him on the podcast a long time ago, he actually look at the size of the shack towering over that fucking equipment. The biggest DJ in the world. He's so big. He's so crazy. Um, but Russell law doesn't like those other guys calling themselves Dj's those like ts doe guys. Really? Yeah, he says that's not a DJ. He's like a DJ. Someone who knows how to play records. These guys are like pressing play on their laptop and bouncing around with their hands up in the air.

Speaker 2:          00:08:46       I mean, I think there's more to apply agree kind of just hitting the playlist and doing your thing. I think there's more to that. It's a different thing. But to those people that want to hear that different, those are the masters. It's like, I just think it's silly to get hung up on one art form or another cause in any art form you're going to have. There's Russell tearing it up. See now he actually knows how to like and scratch and all that shit. He's a talented dude is smart dude. What else is a very experienced, smart, very good dude too. Like one of the nicest people I've ever met. Super, super fucking sweetheart. First we had a roast me on stage. It hurt my feelings, but then that was the way of just kind of all bus a little bus than to the balls.

Speaker 2:          00:09:29       He's just, I love him. Yeah, he's a sweetheart. But um, he's like super passionate about old school DJ in like with record players and shit. Like he's really good at that. And there's an, there's an art to that, but that's why he hates on these new guys. Like Dj ts, stow and well, he doesn't hate on them. He doesn't hate on them. He just doesn't think that they should call themselves djs. Dj a disc jockey, you know what I'm saying? Anyway, each disc jockey though, but they're not a disc. They don't have a disc. He's got a disc and that's part of his art. He's moving disc. Leslie's disc jockey. I see it. Point is like, I just think people let people love that kind of music obviously like Calvin Harris Shit. Hell yeah. And I'm not saying shit in a bad racist jams a way of describing it.

Speaker 2:          00:10:13       But as you're driving down the road in Vegas, man, she's big ass Calvin era's posters and shit and yeah, Diplo, all those electronic guys. I mean obviously people love that sound so I don't think he's saying that they suck. I just think he's saying it's a different thing. Different. Yeah. Cause like obviously if you wanted to hear that shit and you got went there and Russell was scratching records, she'd be like, come on, come on Bro. I'm here to do ecstasy and listen to do dat, Dat, Dat, Dat, you know, you know, disc jockey, a person who introduces in plays recorded popular music, especially on radio or at a discount. They're electric Dj. Maybe time to update that fucking super old school. What the fuck is it? Disco had a disco disco. How about a ballroom? The thing about those Djs like Steve Aoki at a documentary on Netflix, which is ridiculous, but because they're not like live performing, they can do more shows than anyone.

Speaker 2:          00:11:14       So like Steve Aoki was on the road 300 days out of the year, made something like, oh my God, 300 gagillion dollars private jet. He's going from Amsterdam to China. Yeah, just nonstop. Yeah. That's all he do. He was at the Onnit lab. It all out there. He was the guy who is stolen cakes and people's faces, mainly girls. He'd toss cake there. That was his thing. And then kit one girl and her neck was a kid. I think he had a lawsuit, so he stopped throwing the cake and they're very, I don't throw cakes. It was awesome. People would ask for it though. This is what he would do both. Is that the girl that got hurt? No. I don't know. Some girl got whiplash though. Throw

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       a cake. Oh my God. With like a piece of cardboard underneath it is that it's just the bottom of the cake. You know what I'm saying? You gotta put on something that seems sult longest cake toe hits guy in a wheelchair. Well, that's not, oh, let's not watch this. I don't want to watch the guy in the wheelchair get hit in the head. He's all yet. Oh my God. Maybe it's an honor, right? Maybe if you're a fan of Steve Aoki, it's like hit me with the cake. Right? Like if you're like, I had to WWE and someone spits on you, there's a little bit of blood or something and it did. They catch that conversation spit or in the NBA that when they fill their mouthpiece, people catch them. It's disgusting. Heaven's MMA to you can do with that thing. I've seen that. Yeah. Why do people throw them in the audience?

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       Right. I don't know. It's so does seem so preposterous. What does this, Jamie, what is it? You said blood spitting blood. This is it. The guy left and at the Arnold thing, doctors started spraying and blood right in the middle of his lift. Whoa. That's where all clean up everything. I'd take a little break. You need to see a doctor. Sure. He's fine. Got a little stomach thing going on. That's internal bleeding. He's got a little, uh, Nan's probably nasal infection. You think bursting. I like that. Walk it off. You can't be good. I just dead lift a thousand pounds. Looks pretty healthy to me. Let me see. Deadlifts and live a long time. Nine 39. It says she sees this crisis [inaudible] so much weight. I saw crazy one where a dude was doing the squat and the, the bar couldn't handle the weight and the bar bet and he couldn't get it back onto the rack.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       And so he had to like kind of dive out from under it, but it was a shitload of weight. Obviously. Imagine that with that kind of weight on you and you got to figure out how to get it off you. So without it hurting you. Have you seen homeboy who when they do the heavy squats and they blow their asshole out? Oh, I did see that. That's a tough one. Yeah. I would say, I would thought you were going to bring up that guy who was doing, um, who's doing something, one of those crossfit games and he was doing like a clean and his arms gave out and it dropped down in his neck and paralyzed him. Damn Nah, keep it positives. A friend at Tate's landed on his neck out, dead, just fell down. It stops being realized now he's paralyzed from the neck down.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       She just boom, like everything just shut off. He landed on his neck, probably pass on the crossfit for, well, you know what it's on. These guys are two, almost two fucking tough for their own good with something like that where you're holding something over your head. Do you want a thousand reps or just they're just trying to smash everybody's reps and Charlotte how bad ass they are, which is, you know, it's competition. [inaudible] hates that shit. He says that and I see other peoples points to that. It's beneficial that the competition makes you work harder, but Maxwell's take on it is those type of exercise movements like power cleans and things like that, they're not clean up. It's not meant for high reps. I know. Yeah. Those are a strength moves. They're meant for low reps, couple sets, you know, heavy shares. That's not something your body, you shouldn't be doing that and the things that can go wrong and gonna fuck you up.

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       Especially when you start going tons and you're losing your technique and form. It's dangerous shit man. You lose. And this guy was out of position too. I mean, just as bodies. July's tastes. Boy, he had, Tate knows him. Tate Tate's big in that. He's a deepen that crossfit world. He has a lot of those classes. Finished. Barbell clever. What's his thing over there? He just something off Lincoln in Venice. He's always, he's always there. They just liked some strong man shit. There's kids everywhere. I know you're talking about the name escapes me and me to the box. No, I sign it. The box and Venice. Hell, whatever. Calworks works at Venice barbell club Tate's always been into hate somewhere counts though. That kind of working out to sit back in the day. Is it Doosan? Yeah. Okay. There you go. Shout out to do Suzanne. What's up dude?

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       Yeah, Tate's always been into cattle bells and you know, muscle ups and shit like that. And it's just crossfit style movements. And he's a big fan of crossfit. He loves it. Have you done a, a ton of a crossfit? No. I mean I've done, I do those kind of exercises, right? I do a lot of a kettlebell stuff. I do dead lifts. I do a lot of things to do training, but not, but I don't do it the way they do it now. Maybe I do that. Pavel, Tat Salini method where you're doing like sets of five, never more than sets of five. I take that and I take a lot of time off in between sets. I uh, I schedule's been so crazy, man. I haven't been able to go to the gym like it typically do you know where I work with my trainer and not doing weights?

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       I'll do mid stuff like that. So I've been trying to find some alternatives. Yeah, man, it's fun to make shit up. Something different. Yeah. I've been board like a yoga class, take up and doing yoga, doing hot yoga, which I love talking tae kwan doe, Bro. How about that? You want to go deep? Double Knife Ham along me. Go deep after post career front kick and motherfuckers I, I'll pop a hard pass on that man. I don't want anything to do with Marshall, but here's the thing. It's like, do you like, uh, some sort of muck dojo style taekwondo song as they teach you good technique. You're going to get a good workout and try and burn some calories. You know, you could work at it. I'm sure. I'm sure we'll kicks and shit hard pass hard pass. Joe Ito just for a goof. Just you and the fit with the pajamas. Just wrist lock and motherfucker slipping them grabbing that risk. You fly, fly, fly in on the ground. Steven Seagal. That'd be sick. Ooh. Ah, the risks mix.

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       I go full deep on that. No, would be fine if you did it and you just, you did one of them. Uh, I kido demonstrations. You show what happens when someone doesn't just give in. Do you see? He'd be like, he goes and grabs you and does this and you're like, push him away from you. They try to throw you and you just kind of pushed her head down. I like, come on man, come on man. Come on Bro. You don't try to counter them. You just go cut. Just cut shots. Just kept this cause this shake, not, not working.

Speaker 1:          00:18:07       You have to like throw yourself at them. It's all bullshit. But apparently man, those dudes who were bad ass I did back in the day, it was about getting rid of swords. Guy Comes at you with a fucking sore and they're all, they had to learn how to like the guy's lunging at you literally with a ridiculous movement cause he's trying to just chop you up. Right. So it would be similar to how these guys move and throw those yeah. And those demonstration videos. But that shit is not negotiable. If a guy doesn't have a sore, so old school too, it's just fucking wait. Well I was thinking about doing this isn't a sponsor, anything like that. I was looking at those because you have one in the back there. One of those penalty. What? Pelton bikes. Yeah. So you work at Pella and just wake up and do that and then do my thing.

Speaker 1:          00:18:47       Those are great. I think they have a whole thing. You'd do a bunch of different workouts and go online like online cloud. This is a spot. You do it live too. But you know what I like better. I like the rogue bike. That fucking assault bike. What is it called? The Echo. The airdyne. Yeah. Jesus Christ. They made a beefed up version of what? I have one here. Yeah, I see two bottles on it. 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off. Holy Shit Dude. If I give the Pendleton bike, that rogue thing and uh, and uh, or the aerodynamic, like a rower, I'd be straight. Yeah. Rowers bad. I got a row or two rowers. Bad Ass too. I do 30 and 30 with the rower. So 30 minutes of sprint in 30 minutes arrest, 30 minutes of sprint in 30 minutes seconds. She's just Christ. Are you on, sir?

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       Imagine if you could just sprint for 30 excuse me, 30 seconds. So the Tabata is a 2010 and then I go from, I do like um, it'll do eight rounds of 2010 and then I go over and do the row machine and I'll do eight rounds of 30 30 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off. And then I'd go back and do it again and then I'd do it again. And if I've got the sauce, if I got the stones, I could do three sets. Austin, I've only done three sets once and I had a double up on the shroom tech. You felt sick. I was beat down, man, you're just really exhausted at the end of it. It's also a short and your body. Super intense at the tongue they sit and most people think that's the best word that you can do. It does something to you, I guarantee you.

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       Because one of things after doing it like three or four times, I started to feel it in my running. It called running a lot too though. But my running, my endurance and runnings getting better. And I think maybe some of that might have to do with the biking. Just cause the buzzer. Mike works out different muscles to men. Your lungs too when it has to adapt to that kind of capacity moving like that. That's not it. It's the beefy one. I will break that shit. Just saw it Jamie. It's called the rogue echo. Echo air or some shit. I've been doing a the thousand meter test on the row, like I'll get done, hit mitts on my train and then they go 8,000 meters. I see. They have the records for the week. I try and beat the records and just so anybody knows, that's not a sneaky ad.

Speaker 1:          00:20:57       I paid for all the rogue stuff. It's here. I bought it all. No, no, that's it. Right. That dog thing is beefy, beefy as fuck. Got Girders and shit. You got a fat ass handle on a girder. Yanni. Step my game up so I don't have to leave to the gym to save time. It's nice to be able to just do it in your house. You know, all you need is a chin up bar and some kettle bells at home and, and you could just get something done. That's what I need because sometimes you know that thing where you have really, you have an hour before you have to leave. Like a might be looking to the gym and squeeze 30 minutes in. That's the, that's what I've been doing. Yeah. It's cause I have to wake up with my son and I'm like done with him and then him with an hour and then you'd be at the studio here.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       I'm going to New York and doing this. I just wanted to do something at home. Dude. I become addicted to the fasted cardio. I used to do that before. [inaudible] are thrown up. Yeah, but I think that's your coffee intake. Yeah. You're probably ready to talk. What do you like 20 cups a day or something under 16 cuffs and then fasting until to the doctors, not tooth, that moron. That's so much. Whatever. It's so much. Just too much of the switch of everything and if you not having any food then it's just going straight in there. It's all getting absorbed. I'm on all these medications now. I had to get off Kido real dying. Joe Have Stage one diabetes. What is the medications? They put up some antiacid like super strong stuff so I can still drink my coffee. It's just not a possibility. It's not to keep my coffee.

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       I have to. I was like, you will. You will fuck up my entire workflow if I can't drink coffee. So crazy. Yeah, but fasting cardio is the way to go. Yeah. I love it, man. I get addicted to it. You know when I get addicted to, I get addicted to the feeling of having done it when I didn't want to do it. That's what I realized. This running thing is for me. It's this, this little game I'm playing with my brain where I know I'm going to do it, but I wake up, I'm like, oh, and then Marshall's Barkan I'll put him in the backyard. It's like, come on bitch. He wants to go. Dude, he's so crazy now. I love that we've been doing it so much so he's in really good shape at fucking dogs and shaped dogs. Getting shaped like that. He's getting a little Chubby, you know, but he was the only like you still had baby fat on him.

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       He's only 14 months old. So when I took him he was like nine or 10 months old when I first started taking them. I just wasn't sure if he was going to listen or I was worried like what if we run into a rattlesnake or something like that would suck. It sucks. He got used to the routine. You could get them to the hospital though. They survived. They're a lot tougher than us, you know, suck it out. Switch to hit him on the nose. You get us knock it out. That's not real. That's what I've heard bro. I've heard it too. It was ready. So fake that just bro Science, it doesn't work but it can really suck it out. Dogs die cause it hits him on the nose and so you know it gets spread. That's what I've heard. No, my dog had been on the nose.

Speaker 1:          00:23:33       Use. Your dog has my pit by ral sake. Yeah. Did he die? No, he's still alive now. He's dead now. Was a long time ago when we doing this a long time ago. I all my dogs got bit by rattlesnakes except [inaudible] squeaky Fromme she was, uh, she didn't give a fuck about snakes. She was just fuck up other dogs did her, that was my prison dog. That was a dog that I got from the pound that was in the power of this from Callan count and count suggestion feel quite yet what is in the city, the La animal shelter for like five or six months. It was a sweet, sweet dog doe people. It did not want any dogs ruining her new found party dog aggression. Well she, she lived for the formative months of her childhood before I got her, she lived in his cage and I think that that fucks with a dog's head.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       Nobody adopted her for like, I think it was at least five or six months. Poor bunny. And then once you finally do get adopted and get all this love for these people, you get to sleep in bed with them and shit and they take you home. And I mean a dog was, she slept right by my bed. Sometimes they would hop in the bed, but I have to kick them off because they fart and shit. See, I like him in the bed. I like to the dogs in the bed. Keep it. Yeah, it does keep it warm, but sometimes they fart and it's brutal. You like, oh Jesus, if it's a hot summer nights, I get outta here. Man. I know the itchy and shit. But um, she so like any dog that she thought might steal that from her, like any dog that came in, she just, she would growl with dogs.

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       You pet them. She just was not into it. So insecurity issues. There's good and bad guys are running all the time. I've never, I've, I struggled with that a little bit lately where I'll be tired and I'm like, come on, you got to work out. I've never had a work out. And then afterwards went, man, I wish I didn't do that. Yeah, well, ever. Not once people are saying this to people need to understand, like I saw a couple of comments people saying this is terrible advice and you should listen to your body when your body is tired. The snapshot. That's not right. No, you're not. No, no tired. Yeah, I know what I need to rest and I also can, I know like how when I've done too much stuff, like I've done like two works out, two workouts a day, three days in a row before and then you get to that fourth day and you're like, Whoa, all right.

Speaker 1:          00:25:41       I probably should do nothing today. Like just that's, that's almost tougher to do them working out for me to take a day off. It's almost tougher psychological. Yes. Cause I'm like, oh don't be a pussy. You don't see him right now. He's going good. Right? You body starts thinking it's going to go, but there's a moment where you realize that you're probably, I should really monitor my resting heart rate in the morning. That's another thing Steve Maxwell taught me. He said that that's one of the best ways to figure out if you're overtraining, we're training. We still do wake up in the morning. If your heart rate is five to 10 beats over, what it normally is, don't do shit because you're fighting something off. Either you're fighting something off where you need to recover and you can do like light skill work. They say if you're sick, working out makes it worse because it messes up your immune system, your immune system.

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       You're usually, I know if I'm being lazy, I'm like, God was trying to rest in bed, man. Oh, I just want to do this. I'd rather do this, but you know what? If you're not too sick, if you're not too debilitated to work, it's not, it's not a bad thing to just do light, no focus work. Just move. Like try to figure out some technique where you're not doing anything hard in the steam room or sauna. Sauna. Yeah, and someone who asks me about steam versus Sauna. I as Rhonda Patrick and there's, there hasn't really been studies done on the sauna or the steam room either that show the benefits of the sauna, but it'll probably ship that both how to shit. It probably has some benefit. The only difference is that the sauna can get way hotter because it's a dry heat so the sonic can get, you know, my son, I've had it up to more than 190 we sucked up and headed to send that Sutton in Boston.

Speaker 1:          00:27:06       You're a serial killer. The 10 more minutes shop and I was dying. I was like, ah, I think I'm set, man. Think I'm kind of set. I'm all red like a lobster. It's just got to go. You just gotta just go empty in there. I know, I hear Ya. But I was good man. Like no, we were in there for a minute. Jamie dipped out super early. 10 minutes before everybody. I didn't know that. Hey, Jamie got their first shout out to equinox and Boston. Great fucking gym. That's a good night, man. Yeah, they keep it at one 70 that's what most people think it should be. One 70 but if she was one seven he would steam. Man, you're getting cooked in there. That's not good. I don't think you can take that heat, so the idea is that the sauna, because it's a dry heat for the most part, I know sometimes people throw some water on the rocks, but it's a dry heat for the most part, and that that is what you want because that's what your body responds to, the just the actual temperature and producers, those heat shock proteins.

Speaker 1:          00:28:02       That makes sense. Totally makes sense. You know, it's weird sometimes in the UFC, and you can feel this too, if it's at a hockey arena, like t mobile where the sometimes the, when you get into the octagon again, that crowd, it's freezing because there's ice on the low fee for the fighter. Yeah. It takes a while to get going. You see? You'll see guys for the first round like, God, he looks a little stiff or what's going on here? It's freezing out there, man. You're Justin shorts, right? You're sweating in the back and it's warm in that locker room. Then when you come out, it's this God, so he's a total difference when you get in right away. I'd like, goddammit. I'd always think about it. Is that a hockey team there? Oh there's ice. So I had to calculate that thought or focus on something else, but I didn't realize it until one day I saw like a crack in between the boards, the floorboards and I looked down, I went, that's fucking ice.

Speaker 1:          00:28:50       There's ice there right now. And like you get to keep it. They keep the ice there. They keep ice, they keep ice. You're just all these thousands of people chill on top of ice. Well it can't break. No, I'm just saying it's kind of weird. Oh, it's definitely weird. But it's it better. Well not for the fighters for sure. But is it better for the audit? Because it, sometimes it gets fucking hot in those places if you have a just a big ass chunk of ice in the middle of everybody. I think keep kind of smart. Like the only time it's been super cookie is in, in Brazil. There's didn't use any AC or anything. I was in one of them and it was an open air place in Brazil, so we're indoors but at the top, the top areas, it's like these big open doors that face the outside.

Speaker 1:          00:29:34       There's bugs flying around. Shit. Some Brazilians shit man. It was moist and warm. Where was though? It was Wa there's one with Anik in someone and they're literally just sweating the pit stains and sweating it out. That happened in Abu Dhabi too. We're not with Dobie. I was drenched. That was outdoors. That was an outdoor, yeah. Who was that mean? Hilson Weidman Anderson. Damien Maia. That's right. Yeah. Why did we find out there too? I forget. I think you flat. Bj Penn fought Frankie Edgar. That's where a Frankie Edgar won the title and the, they've had Roy. Yeah. Nog out there. Yup. Haven't been back there in a while. It's been a while. It's been a minute. Hot Minute. Yeah. That one was crazy cause you, you saw bugs flying around and you never knew were real [inaudible] shit out there. I went on a hike. I was like, oh I'm in Jumanji. This is cool.

Speaker 1:          00:30:23       Like, what in the fuck is this shit you've never seen before? It's crazy. He'd go to other countries, man, they're there. They have completely different ecosystems. The point where you look at things, you go, what in the fuck is that? What is that? But where it's dangerous too. I remember I was in Brazil, we are climbing this thing and they go, now listen fellas, you got to make sure we're with the locals. Like you have to come down before nightfall, otherwise they're not going to find you. What kind of Shit is this? So we just dipped out getting up there and my man, I man, her legs like, man, you got lost. He, we didn't see him for the rest of the night. The local was like, he's one, he's one with the jungle now. I'm like, Whoa, what the fuck does that mean? The rundown and some shit.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       What do you mean he's one with the jungle? He just, he said he showed up a day later, just exhausted. Don't get an ounce of sleep. And someone in one of these huts took them under their wing and saved them. Oh my God. People up. Do you get helicoptered out of there? If they get trapped at the top? I was like, dude, I feel like I shouldn't be doing fight. I feel like it's a bad idea. How many days before a fight was this? This was like a week before. It's crazy. The guy in front of us had assumed gone basically a speedo just asshole out in front of us. Just fucking going and I'm like [inaudible] your foot and just doing work. Smoking US shredded 10 fucking all us with their feet look like, like hobbits feed like fucking craziest feed ever. These people that live in the forest, they splay out like a hand and they, they're super thick toes and she didn't like it doesn't look anything like, no, we have bitch feet.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       Yeah Dude. Believe me man. Sore today. I had a run in regular running shoes because my feet are sore from the vibrams and yeah, from the just the pounding. I know. I'm scared of that plantar fasciitis than we ever had it. No, get your mind right. Let's go ahead and get on. There's a reason there's technology son. Let's quit run beer. But no, no, no. I think it just the barefoot thing strengthens your feet up. I think it just takes time. I'm just being real careful. Be Super careful. It's a nightmare. I'm sure Dominick Cruz had to deal with it. I've done it at night. I had to get shots and Jackson and my foot and with dom cruisey was the same thing. It was coming back too quickly. Like he, he had a knee injury, right. So after his knee injury then he just tried to get way back in shape, way quick and

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       fucked his feet up. Mine was just, I think from being so big in this running I was doing, you know, miles and miles and miles and miles. I love running. It's layered. My favorite thing to do, Neil Brennan did it on it. He got planner from a treadmill from wearing those vibrams. If, if you're, they say you got to work into them kind of work. Just don't want it to go straight barefoot and just start doing work. No, you definitely do. To me, you do good to be barefoot. Like I like walking in the street. I feel like I'm doing something dangerous. Like on the sidewalk. Korea flit. Yeah, like double. I'm while go. Wow. I feel nice about it. I don't know what it is, man. It makes me feel free. Yeah, I know. It's dirty and dangerous clothes to get dirty and dangerous. That's what life is supposed to be supposed to be.

Speaker 2:          00:33:17       Interacting, interacting with other life barriers. That's your feet. Nice rubber barrier between you and the world. That shit ain't right. You always can find. I like to let them breathe a little bit. Man. One of the Indians had it right with moccasins. He, there's no airflow with those Goddamn moccasins. They didn't give a fuck with things smelled like back then. All that smelled like they gave up. They just didn't give a fuck. That felt like if they could find a creek, the temporary, put some of that fire out real quick. I'm not about that life. I'm not, I'm not like that ma'am, but they would just run around with moccasins. They basically just had like a layer of leather between their foot in the ground. It's all they could do. Climb mountains with that. Hey, hey, hey, what is this Jamie? How dare you Jamie?

Speaker 2:          00:33:59       This guy is slicing chunks off of the bottom of his foot. I mean those houses that makes me feel sick, bro. Man cuts cows off his foot with a knife and dog eats it. This is the name of this video. How the fuck did you find that? Look at these callouses, dude, this is insane, bro. This guy is just slicing through these cows is like, it's a coconut, like it's coconut milk. It's like a pineapple. This is insane. Have you ever seen anybody have cows? It's like this before though. I think this guy has a problem. Why ain't normal? What kind of a man can just cut out his foot like that? How do you don't hop how deep to cut? We don't cut your him he off. You know this dude is not sharpening that knife. That's not a sharp knife. That's not she's, this is crazy ma. That guys can feed them and the dog, the dog is taking the pieces of meat mean a dog's a man eater.

Speaker 2:          00:34:49       That's how in the world foreign TV, Jamie's got that bookmarked. Couldn't wait. Did you say feet? Just couldn't wait till the track. That shit. Who the fuck cuts off the bottom of their feet with a knife like that and what's he doing to get his feet like that? Why is he yelling at that dog while I taught his feet? That makes it this close thrown out. Wouldn't you like to think that the dog would get used to that smell like that's what I like to eat now and then like you'll be sleeping. The dog's hungry. He's like, fuck it. I'm just kind of snack out in this dude's feet. Zombie. Doug, you got a Zombie dog in his now it looks like a bloodhound to dogs. Got Damn horrible monster meeting either human neater. Wow. Going to feel super sick man. On another note, how about that?

Speaker 2:          00:35:33       Brian Ortega, the other know how bout banner take, give him, I don't want to show yesterday night as awkward cause me and Brian are super close and I don't know what it is because same thing with Steve Bay. Whenever I know these guys, it's a, I know him from when, when I trained with them and I've seen it in that light like with Brian or take a corner him for his, one of his fights before he got to the UFC and I knew him as that Brian or Tayga where all Jujitsu, you know, cardio for days, but terrified to fight. Like I know miss is that Brian and now he's evolved into the number one feather weight in the world. So when I, when he get the Frankie Edgar fight, I was like, God, I just feel like it's a terrible match up man. I'm telling Hannah, I'm like, what's he going to do?

Speaker 2:          00:36:12       And he's like, don't worry man, don't worry. And so on my show, which Brian and Heather listen to, to like do they come in and like, how are you gonna pick against me? I'm like, no. I said, my brain went with frank. You just, cause it's Frankie Edgar, he's a legend. My heart wanted to do Brian. He's like, dude, it hurt my feelings. I'm like, I don't, I don't, I'm sorry man. Like I, and I don't know what it is with Steve Bay too. Whenever I see him, I know him as that version of them. It's a problem that I have. I like this gap. I don't know what's going on. People always do that. They do that. You remember someone by what they were when they were at their worst and not even the worst, but it's in the infancy of their, of their, of their careers, their worst.

Speaker 2:          00:36:48       Just say a lesser version of who they are now. Correct. Right. It's like, do you ever get that feeling when you go back to high school? Like if I'm around someone from high school, I feel like a loser. I know this is a weird feeling, not 100% when I go back to Denver, I'm, I'm almost not myself because I feel like this almost the Allen was like this loser. A loser because, yeah, because you remember back who you were when you were insecure and starting out in life and just that's a normal thing. You know, they always say that about comedy clubs. Like if you start out at a club, that club will never respect you. They respect you when you leave and you know, maybe you get a TV show or something like that and then come back and the gay. Yeah, I remember when you sucked though.

Speaker 2:          00:37:28       Do you remember when you suck? I always had it. I had a problem with that and Boston at first. Really? Yeah, because they remembered me as this guy who was an opener and then you know, how am I had like I remember when you were opening and you did 20 minutes, you open. That's what you do. I know. Like you're not a headliner. I had one night and this is not in my nature at all. I'm going to go back. It just been busy. But I had one at the laugh factory. I've just, I bombed Ben Bom Bom like, like, cause like I should probably not do this. Oh, just one guy in the back. She goes, oh. I'm like, no doubt. No doubt man. I get in the car and I drive down sunset. I'm like, what the fuck am I doing man? It's so embarrassing.

Speaker 2:          00:38:08       I've been back since but not because because of my column scare, the laugh factory. It's just that I've been at the store and then just been on the grind, but I do have it in your head like you got to get back up there and clean that up and literally I think about every day it's something back here and to get your ass up there, man. We go, but I'll go to the comedy store. Nope, get your ass up there. See that's an athlete's perspective. That's the difference. It's one of the things that I've been saying to people about you. The difference between way you've been approaching

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       comedy and another person would do it. You're doing it from an athlete's perspective. Like you work hard at Shit and you know where your weaknesses are and you got to, you fix those other people, ignore him. That's a real problem. You know like it. Like someone will have a joke and the joke doesn't do well like several nights in a row, but they keep doing it the same way. Like, why are you doing it the same way? You need to cut some of that out. You need to tweak this and you turn that around and needed to add something. Maybe not explaining it enough, but if it's not doing well and you keep doing it the same exact way, it's not the crowds Homan. Yeah, you got to figure out they're there to laugh. People get stuck in a weird pattern though of wanting to do things exact same way over and over again.

Speaker 1:          00:39:12       Oh, nothing's better than me when it, it's such an honor to have him at the comedy store. If I was, it comes through in La Jolla in a comic go, hey, you should try this. I listen to jokey. Should button with this or try this. I'm like, dude, that's brilliant, man. Yeah. Every now and then someone will just nail it for you. They just find, they see something that maybe you didn't see any like, oh, like you ever thought about going this direction? I'm like, dude, it's not like the writing your jokes like, Hey, what if we went this direction with, I'm like that dude. That's brilliant. Man That's happens in martial arts too, right? Like hasn't someone like pointed something out to and you're like, oh shit. Oh, 100% with a choker. Your hands are like this. Do you ever tried it like this? And I do that.

Speaker 1:          00:39:48       Yeah. That makes sense. It's so much easier. Yeah. Sometimes things don't seem like they'd be easier and they are like this, that Pretzel Grip, this grip. And you're like, why would I grab something like that? And then you do and you like, if someone shows you, but I feel like not in my, yeah, it feels nice. Feels Nice. Oh you ain't getting, no, no, no. It's a bribe. Or take your shit to his guillotine is ridiculous and icy grip it and he's getting, he, he's, he's just a, he has all sorts of variations. Emma fuckers Nice with it. He's here, you know it's right. You know he's here a lot of times he goes flat. He's so good at it. But cozy like Marcello, like how Marcel slides it. Yeah. Like a blade catches laid. Yeah. And he's, he's the best at the world in it. But he also, he's getting the respect now from the crowd because if you remember when Frankie kind of fake that shot and got ahold of his neck then craton tire cargoes.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       Yeah. Cause it's like, oh shit. They realize what he's capable of when that dude gets a hold of your neck. It's a totally different proposition. When he would, he did to cub Swanson at the end of the first round, basically be that cob basically out cub was fucked and it was just a matter of the time ran out. But that shit was fully locked in and cub wasn't going anywhere. I got emotional yesterday when he came in the room because I haven't seen him since and I went [inaudible] not even on air went, hold on. Stop though Bro. Let hear me real quick before we went. Tells you this under you get in touch all that and went, you're the number one feather weight in the world. Remember I cornered you for that rough and nasty fighting. Would her Glendale where the fuck with or that?

Speaker 1:          00:41:17       No, he's the number one guy in the world. Brian let that soak in. He's a number one contender. Max Holloway's in number one in the world. He's ranked number one the world. Right, but number one contender true. He's number one. I was insane. That's always the champ. That's the number one until they find the champion. Right. Number one the world. That was the message. I not understand that. That if I was Max Holloway motherfucker for, well they're going to fight for sure. Not Max Holloway is the greatest featherweight in the world right now, but for providing or Tayga to go from. It's crazy to see, man. It's a very interesting fight. It's nuts cause the Ortega is super dangerous standing in on the ground. He's on a totally different level than anybody else. They're also the same size, like the way it usually has a big advantage of reach and size, but now they're kind of equal.

Speaker 1:          00:42:02       Dude. Holloway something special though, man. He's something special. Special. He did it. Although when he did the Aldo was crazy twice, twice and the second time. More emphatic like, like he knew he was getting no, that's always something special. Special. And it's almost like when you watch what he does, you can't appreciate it until you see it a bunch of times. Because like what he's doing, he's not knocking someone out with one head kick. He's not like catching someone with some unbelievable spectacular submission. No. What he's doing is just fucking you a cause. Outclassing regularly. Yeah, with technique and he's ferocious. And then where do you want to do you want to do take out, do you want to do pace? You want a little bra? You want a bra? I'm gonna draw the line right here. Come ball and see how that goes for it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       And that's what Brian kept fall into. And I, Brian will be, I'm sure in Vegas eyes, the underdog, which rightfully so, it's Max Holloway, the greatest featherweight in the world right now. So with Brian Hitch says to be careful, Max alert you into that brawl and he's not going to lose those brawls. Yeah, he's very good at Bra and that's for damn sure. And he did. The crazy thing was the, the lamas fight. Oh my God. Ricardo Lamas. He's beating his ass and then he just points the set of the schedules. Come on man, let's fucking throw it out. He's one of my favorite fighters. Then bites his mouthpiece down. It's just windmill and that you can do that. Can you do technique? You want to do Jitsu? Whatever you want to do. I really want to do. It sounds like from what Brian told me is they're, they're aiming for that international fight week.

Speaker 1:          00:43:21       So you'd have DC, Steve Bay, maybe Cyborg, Amanda Nunez. Then you got Brian. We're taking Max Holloway. Well matches broke his foot. So what are we at right now? How many weeks is he out? Is even out of his cast yet. I don't think he's out of his cast. I think I saw a photo of him on Instagram was about two weeks ago. He had a cast on, he's on tough help in DC right though. You probably done the tough catches or doing it, you know, standing on his cast. But who are we in March, April, May, June, April, May, June, July, four months. Um, a foot of bone in the foot is not, it's not an easy one because you're always standing on it. No. And then when you get back, it's going to take time and then you're going to be real hesitant to kick things. Well, Hey, I, I'm not the one who started the rumor was international fight week.

Speaker 1:          00:44:04       That's what, yeah, that's what, that's what, or take his hearing. He, they want to do in Hawaii. Obviously Heather and Brian wanted, they were like, we'd love to go to Hawaii, go to his hometown and do it. But you know, there's a lot of moving pieces for UFC get to Hawaii. Well the other thing is inside and outside, like how, how big of an arena they have that's inside. It was well outside the of the stadium, right? They could do the giant state in which would sell out. It would sell out. But what if it rained, which it does in Hawaii all the time. We fighting in the ring wet and wild. Remember that one and watch that. Can you the cage, you wouldn't watch that rainy, the rainy. I mean, it'd be so weird, but no, you can't take the breast to have. Yeah, it's a good risk to have.

Speaker 1:          00:44:42       Look, can't have it though. You got to be phenomenal for Brian. If they could just slip to the ground real quick. Amazing for he has, he has a good advantage over almost everybody at one 45 when it comes to Jujitsu, like who doesn't have an advantage of when it comes to Jujitsu at one 45? No one, no one more dangerous than t city swabs on the ground and he locks on to things. There's a finale to it, that strength in his, now his belief in himself with it, he knows how dangerous he is. There's a it and really it's, he's almost, you know, people haven't seen what that kid's capable of either. Like we, we seen some cool stuff, but some of his flying triangle is flying armbars in his, his, his, his grips and stuff and his guillotines and his, a lot of cool setups that we haven't even touched on.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       So, yeah, he's uh, one of the most impressive guys I've ever seen in terms of like when he starts locking something up, you know, it's over game over like whoa. Came over. Just super high level. Very interesting because it doesn't have like world championship, uh, you know, victories in his past, right? No, he didn't come up through like the IB Jff, whatever the hell it is. Or he didn't go to metamorphs anything like that. He's just this kid that grew up on the Gracie mats and over time was that kid who was just like, God damn, he's good. And just kept with it, kept with it, kept with it. Now the crazy thing is, is striking has become just as deadly fluid. Crack Frankie Edgar with an elbow like that and then starch in with that uppercut. That's like, he can do that to standing now off his feet.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       Yeah. Yeah. It was, it had to be. So where's the, where's the picnic picnic? It's not standing. Not Right. And I helped pull for Max Holloway. He's probably looking at going the picnic for me standing cause he's so God damn you know good at it. But you can't just say that's a huge advantage anymore after you see or take a, just remember he's knocked out clay Greta with knees, you know. Now after you knock out Frankie Edgar like that, you like least have to acknowledge the kids can do some standup damage. I think. Yes, but I think there's a real concern with if they're going to try to fight in July with Halloween, not having enough time to recover. I hope I'm wrong, but when I'm looking at that, when you just said that it's march and I was like, yeah, it is march isn't it began in Montreux, may, June, July.

Speaker 1:          00:46:50       That's four months. How do they have, how, how he healed up? Are you after four months, are you ready to throw kicks and get your foot checked? Well who knows? Maybe they also tour, maybe Dana told or Brian like, hey, we're shooting for Mars. We're shooting for July summer, something like that. But they don't realize where Mac tall, you know how this goes. Maybe it's on another car. Maybe I'm wrong though. Maybe. I mean six weeks is what it takes for bone to heal max a tweet us or something. Be like, yeah, I'm good right now. Bitch. Google what it takes for a healthy, what is Max like 28? No, 27th sec on him and Brian or tell you the same age. 20 couple of young bucks something. Yeah. And this won't be the last time you see a brighter taking Max Holloway fight. What's that? It's 26

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       26, sorry, 27. Um, go to uh, how long does it take? Just Google. How long does it take for a bone on a 26 year old man to heal and they cut it in half because Max Holloway. Yeah, that's either you don't have the doctors. She going to be about six months. Well yes, if I'm a soccer mom, six months. For me it's going to be about three. Thank you sir. I'm going to push it at three. You giant pussy. That's also a way to blow out those ACO reach that top doctors. Are these still all these old people and like you were out for about a year. That's true. Three months. Dog Kick rocks. You know what man, this uh, tended to engines injury that I got. I got Golfer's elbow. That really made me, I'm aware there's a difference between injured a muscle and an injury, an attendant hundred percent.

Speaker 2:          00:48:15       They don't have much blood supply man. It's that fucking average in the Dick to get that to heal. I'm stunned at how long it takes and how many different things I've done when, since you told me that I was doing pull ups in a striver hurting here, I've stopped doing for a little bit cause I don't want to just hear, it's just this, it started hurting in there and that's when the here and now I'm like, you know, I'm a chill out on that stuff. I got a chunk of something floating around there too. You get like a piece of hard something or another. I fell once and Alaska, Collin and I were on this deer hunting trip and I slipped off the side of a cliff and cracked my elbow in this rock. And it was hurting for months afterwards. Like every time I would do a chin up, it would hurt and I just sucked it up and I think I might have chipped a piece of bone off in there.

Speaker 2:          00:48:58       I think there's something floating or it's a piece of calcium that's built up because of, uh, irritation that can happen. But it ride, Bro. Yeah, Bro. You got this man bro. Science dude. Speaking of people getting fucked up. How about that girl side work? But she looks good. When she got hit with the first one, her eyes were like, oh my God. And God bless her man. Because your first fight in UFC, hey go this. This is what you always wanted. Here's Cyborg main event. Short notice. Enjoy that. Yeah, that's kind of a crazy thing to do, right? Title shot your first fight ever in the UFC title shot the first fight ever. And nobody knows. Literally nobody in the UFC knows who you are. You'll see it. Even have a picture up of her till the week of the fight. You've never, uh, I mean she got submitted by Tanya evenger.

Speaker 2:          00:49:42       It's tough. She submitted, Tanya and Tanya submitted her and we know that she's a one 30 Fiverr. Yeah, that's her like wincing in pain as Cyborg lowers the boom CyBorD down though. She did that weird. Yeah. Well that was obviously the strategy. The strategy was to close the distance, get that clinch drag side work to the ground. She's a one 35 or man, she really is not big enough, but for cyber it's like, what do you want me to do, man? Like there's no one in the division. What is stopping that Megan Anderson check from coming over her work visa. She shows here she was here illegally or something like that. No, that was the hold up there. Oh, some bullshit lawyers cause on the, I know, man, let's go. Cause she, she's a legit, you know, big girl. Pretty Australian fight. Her ass all tattooed up.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       She's actually the one, you know, she's in the same weight class and she wants to fight. Cat Zingano wanted the fight too. She's talking all that shit for real one called Trump. I can't get it done. God wants to fight. We'll cat Zingano did what? The cyborg fight. But since she lost that last one, beer Catlin split decision. You Ain't getting sideways not sniffing. No, no, no, no, no, no. There's no way she's going to have to get a couple of it. Cause she lost her last one too. She took Julianna Pena. Yeah. And she, she, she's taken too much. You could see the ring rust was there and the nerves are there. She just, she, she needs time. She has time. She can compete there with Cyborg. I, I'm trying to be funny here. She's not going to lose to single woman. You need, she needs to fight to women or that needs to be a dude in there.

Speaker 2:          00:51:11       But one girl's not going to beat her. I hate to tell you guys like it's just not, I don't know how you're going to market that. You're telling me you wouldn't watch her cm punk. Well I think you put her as co main event a lot on some cards that have a lot of great fights. I just think that people are always going to give, willing to watch whoever steps in and fights are, but to have her be the center of a giant event, I think it's going to take a real challenger like Holly. Those ratings were good. Yeah, that was a good fight because that was a fight where people are like, hmm, Holly, you know, is legit. Like real skillful box shows you how good the decision. Although she, you know, Holly was never really winning that fudge, but maybe once a month shot.

Speaker 2:          00:51:50       Yeah, she got lit up. You realize when you're in there fighting Cyborg, it's totally different proposition. You know when you, when you see cyber you're just like, oh man, she's never going to lose until father time, I guess touches around the shoulder right now she's only 32 crazy. It's not young, but it's not old either. No, she's not at all. She prime [inaudible] for another five years. Easy. When you know, you think about how long she's been around, like way back to the Geno Carano find. How old was she then? Jesus man, super young. Super Young. She's been doing it for a minute. Did you ever watch that fight again? It's not bad fight. People don't give enough credit. No. Gina mounted or at one point in time to, you know, first team all diabetes captain. The team. Yeah, it was pretty hot. But out of respect and Kevin Ross, this will be the end of this conversation when it comes to how hot is that a man?

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       What's he do? Kevin Ross. Muy Thai fighter. Oh yeah. With all, he's all tatted up. They're still together? Yeah. Good for them. Good for them. Hopefully she'll hear it cause the fight. Yeah, she's, she's got to be very cool because he's very cool. They're this the beginning of fine. She's just teeing off on June. She takes her down and fucks up and Gino ones up on top of her. Look at Gina doing where people forget how good that girl was. Men, how she's very good. Look at the Cyborg. You should give her royalties were starting women's MMA. Let's be real. Halfassed heel hook here are half decent heel hook here. She's an attorney. Get out of it. Actually popped out yet. Gina. Cronk. I mean, she just think out big Gina Crown would be if she was in the sport right now, Jesus sidebars hit or want some hammers.

Speaker 2:          00:53:20       This was a, yeah, she would be gigantic. She'd be so, because she was Zanup when the UFC was really in its infancy. She's big on showtime. What year do you think his fight was? If you had to get 20004692000 nine really nine wow. Cyborg vicious kicks to the body. So cyber was only like, what, 22 ish or take down your shot again and this time Gina amounts or look at that like people forget genus. Getting them out because sideboards mistakes, but still mal. Yeah. This the most troubling you've ever seen Cyborg in besides that Moy Thai fight and gene's going to let her up. No, Gino was an absolute monster. People forget man. But with cyber I, I'm dead serious. I'm even trying to be funny. Women enter that octagon against her. She's not going to lose or do you need to get Khabib up in that bitch? Well, she obviously has some physical attributes.

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       Now, when you think about the rest of the women at one 45, no one stands out. What they're gonna do as Amanda Nunez. That's the fight. Yeah, I may have missed wants it. Cyborg wants it. I liked to fight and I think technically Amanda Nunez is better as far as a technician as Cyborg. However, for let's say that's five rounds, even three rounds over those three rounds, she, she, I don't think she possesses the same power as Cyborg. You know what I'm saying? They'd be Cyborg kits. A girl, you see it on their face. The stoppage of Gina Carano we're watching on the big screen. It's horrific. It's tough one. And it's horrific when she gets her down like the hammers that she drops on her of a Cyborg Fan. I'm more of cyber fan now. Back then I was first team all Gina.

Speaker 2:          00:55:01       No one wanted that. No one wanted that. Did she tests positive for this fight? Uh, no. I thought it was after this another five that was in this fight. That'd be way bigger than news. But, um, cyborg. Amanda A. Good fight. That's a really good, I just in how I'm a huge Amanda Nunez Fan. I just think over that time she's going to land some shots on sidewalks. I won't get hit, but when cyborg kitchen, it's, it's just he can't play that game with her. There's, there's no female in the world. He can play that game with her. You give me one off lake when you hear, you hear, it just doesn't work. Dude. Who knows? Man, that's interesting. It's a great fight though. Amanda's got legit one punch power, legit smack him up. Power real black belt in Jujitsu. Very good at fighting. Knows how to fight.

Speaker 2:          00:55:45       Phenomenal fighter. Yeah. She knows how to fight. Forget about all the things that she can do. She puts it together. Well, you know who can fight Cyborg. Cyborg. Yup. She's the greatest female fighter of all time. It's hard to argue. It's hard to argue, right? Yeah. It's hard to argue. Did some caveats in there, obviously, but it's hard to argue evenly. Yeah. Yeah. There's some caveats I guess really to go down that road. But still in the UFC with the Usada testing, she's still the best. So that kind of takes out of the window. We'll choose the best back then and she tends to as hot. Cool. Now she's in the strict thing, the most strict testing pool of all time. She's still dominating. So where's your argument there now? Well, you know the argument that she retained all the shit from when she was

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       taking it back in the day, retain something. I'm not everything though as Hector Lombard to question ask Vic doorbell. Right. That's true. But the, those are men. It's different. The idea of, you know, a guy taking shit or a girl taking it, don't you think they're different? It's, it's different, but it's also, it's different. There's argument there, but it's not different to the point where after tea was that 2009 you sentences. So after nine years she's still retaining this muscle mass and she was born a bigger female. That's true too. That's true too. Like no matter what Gabby Garcia did, she still six four, correct? She'll giant. Did. She was at the UFC. I was like Ho Lee. Shit. You're scared. Terrifying. Should way too vague for terrified all of them. She's so big. Do you see she, she wasn't sitting like a lady. So it's security to come behind you and DC and stuff in front of her. She can't sit like a lady. She's got long legs. She might, they know when to ask though. Cause she's crossing those legs bro. I just too much done this. So they're so big. Yeah. So have you have like one of them super tank, crossfit squat girls, those giant legs, the blonde ass and the quads. Can they even cross their legs? I'm sure. How could they cross cross your legs? Yes. Yes. Legs. I cross. My legs is comfortable and I get along. I got to tear it back. They'll date.

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       I don't think doc is a big decks. You Might wanna change that one up. But the Burger, they have tails. Do they, I don't know bird there. Our bird. They're not a dinosaur. Well they're not a dinosaur. Yeah. Did you know that? They're in a class of themselves was telling me that. My Kid told me that. Oh, that's right. Seven year old. See this this way right here. This is uncomfortable. It's fonts. So comfy or nut cruncher us. I'm so comfortable. Yeah, but you got an extra foot of leg. Yeah, there's a lot of room here, but with get with Gabby Garcia. Remember when she was like, like big bloated girl and she got shreds. Shreds city for patrol. Oh, totally. Misread city. And then she backed the in between. She's back to giant again, I think. Why not try and cut the 45 what are you talking about?

Speaker 1:          00:58:26       Who? She's six 80 do you know? She's six. Four I'm in the UFC or not [inaudible] 70 to make it. She's good friends with Cyborg to look how big. Okay. She was when she got some all and helping. She is now two. Shit's hot. When she was small, she wasn't bad. Callan. That's what I saw. That's what I saw in the air. Like look at that. Oh, that's when she was on the ultimate fighter with Vandelay. I wonder where she's at mentally when she sees her stuff. Like does she date that? Cause a lot of dudes are into that. She can't go online. Like I like I had a friend who's a female bodybuilder. Dick Thicker than a snicker is definitely deca. Gold's gym, just interacting, get just protein powder seeping out of a goddamn eyes. Get that pink one above it to the right above, above and to the right. Okay. That's not mad at all. Not Mad at it at all. So at one point in time, in the recent future, she got down to the body of a really

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       hot crossfit. How much did she weigh there though? She's probably still a thousand pounds. Six foot four main bro. She I what do you think? What? 60 there? No, I bet she's there. She's 200 bro. She's not 200 accounts there. I bet she's 200 don't you Jamie? Jamie. She's 64 come on bro. Okay. Maybe she's one 95 but I'm not going any lower than that. That's a big girl. She is. She's a legit six floor. Pretty sure Pinal how tall she is. She's stronger than me. That's whatever. But there's some dudes that there's a market for that. I got a friend who was a bodybuilding, she was busy cause she would do some little bit strange for some change and get oil down. She's always takes two. I'm sorry, two 36 six two we can make one 45 she's going to lose a hundred pounds. Nobody. Real jobs going say why I got you.

Speaker 2:          01:00:16       What would, what do you think would happen if she just got completely off of everything and just ran marathons? What do you think she'd get down to? I don't think she lowered to 36 to two 36 look at the fucking size of her. Probably one 17 Jesus Christ. Look at that girl. I'm going to death, right? No, this poor girl. Good to see. Did you see her beat up though? Do you see a beat up the grandma? Yes. With a knee brace. He beat up a grandma and a knee brace, bro. So wrong struggle city. I hear, here's her like, first of all, she's really good at Jujitsu by the way. Phenomenal, right? Mackenzie during her matches. Yeah. Mckenzie beat her on points. How crazy. That's how bad ass Mckenzie dearness. She poked his chick apparently, and they found that checkout fake. Like, I get poke too.

Speaker 2:          01:00:57       Yeah, good move. I'd fall down. I'd black out how she's rushing though. They can't and she'll get murdered. She gets back to really get in there. Someone's got a bet. I have bit to make it to one minute survive any way you can for fun. We need, dude, I just boom. How do they not have her fight? Dude's like, oh, that's it. Oh good move for her. No more. It can go. The fight has gone one minute that my obligation is over here to think about her research. Cyborg, perverse, Cyborg, Cyborg, or fuck her up. Jeff Novitsky cycle hike for a couple of weeks. So much better standing up than her. She would have to take cyborg down and cyborg would fuck her up. So when she went to watch that now really for obvious reasons that we can't talk about. Look at that. There she is right there.

Speaker 2:          01:01:42       Palm Palm Palm, but legit black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu. You can say whatever you want about it, but the girl works her ass, her ass off no matter what. No matter what you take, you don't get that big unless you're training hard. She's just dropping bombs in this check. Her striking has gotten a lot better, lot more smooth and relaxed. Like she was having a hard time when she first got, Ooh, Jesus shared tagged that Leah to Tapa is doing work. She would say, oh, she got attacked again. Damn. Her striking is terrible. Well, she's hurt. She's hurt. She's well, but this

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       is what got me. Joe, look at this chick's going, come on, come on. Come on Sarah. Come to center. Damn. She's like, bring it. She'd get a little emotional though. That rise in just free for all and I shade it. So gangster, they're so gangster. They're trying to bring back the golden days. I now you know what that day is over. So kind of give it a rest, but I like what they're doing. You see belt or brought cro, cop back. The Cro cop Roy. I just don't tell. We've seen that just on test. Anybody please. I just couldn't, I don't know. Don't know. Don't just stop testing. I'll say with the John Jones thing against Brock Lesnar. Hey Jeff. Novitsky let's, uh, go grab a cup of coffee while these boys rumble. Huh? Do we Levine while we go? Why don't you go, go, go on vacation to Hawaii while John and Brock take a little a tripper.

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       The UFC is clean, but it doesn't have to be UFC. UFC decided to go down that you sought a road and they've committed to it. It's changed the game legitimately for sure. Let's be honest, when you've been fucking life, I've got a legend like cro cop. He still wants a fight. Excuse me. That'll help if a hundred or so up mom, that's real. I'm not saying he needs it. I'm not, I'm not, it's not a knock on him. He's upset at me because a bas Rutten was saying that during one of his fights that uh, they paid him all this money and they had to bring all this money back, like bosses explaining at the bottom into a room and say, boss said it, but he thinks that I said because it was on your show. Yeah, it was on my show. I didn't know what my boss was going to say and if I heard anything about it, I heard it from boss cause boss worked there and bosses just fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          01:03:55       And he's telling me about how they would pay those guys in cash. Well he doesn't like you. He likes me and I punched him in the face. So me and him are friends, but I just want him to know I'm a big Fan Heli Pad for Cro cop. I always enjoyed watching him and he's the, the example that I always use of what happens when you get an explosive striker versus a technical striker in MMA. I think when you get a high level striker that's used to a certain style of fighting and then they fight an MMA, sometimes that style doesn't translate over. Like I don't think Peter Arts would have done that good as an MMA fighter. I don't think Ernesto hoost would have done that good because they would have to have changed the way they strike because there are so technical and it really fun to watch fight and they would bra for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:04:38       But what Merkel would do was have these big one shots, these big one kicks, he's big one punches, just jump in with one shot super fast and quick. That is really beneficial in MMA more so even than kickboxing because it's the volume the he's fighting guys who are, um, it at the time were, they were concerned about take downs. You concerned about all these different things that could possibly happen in an MMA fight. Right. So no one stands the way they stand in kickboxing when they're standing in kickboxing there more sideways, they're more light on their feet. They're moving around cause they don't have to worry about being taken down. It's a totally different proposition. It's also a dance in a rhythm. Yeah. So guy like host. Yeah, guy like who's would just pick you apart, start leg kick and you chopping down. If he's got to think about takedowns even really great strikers are susceptible to one pot shots in MMA because there's so many more things you're thinking of.

Speaker 1:          01:05:34       That's why Kevin random and crack cro cop and knocked them out of their fight because he's got to worry about the takedown. Like if they were just in a kickboxing fight. Kevin Randleman and Cro cop, Justin Kay, one nightmare. It's a nightmare for Kevin about Wonderboy Woodley Wonderboy all day. They going to kickboxing match all day. Wonderboy light him up, Woodley that one shot power and he dropped, you know one a boy, you know before I say that even in kickboxing Woodley I think would do very well because he's so powerful and, and you'd be able to manage it more though. You be to gloves so you catch more. And also his punches aren't as dangerous. So when he's hitting you, it's not as dangerous. You can catch the kicks a little bit better. It's still not fun. Hell, no wonder boys. Octagon is a nightmare. We're not one shot power.

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       Yeah. Those little gloves got hopefully fight soon, man. He's going to, he's a, he had shoulder surgery at a torn labrum, so he's, he's pounding on that, trying to get that fixed up. He dos Anjos that's what they're going to do. Maybe they'll do that international fight week to dawn. Dawn Sizzla, which I can get these ratings up for Fox buys. WWU imagine if Brock's first fight back as John Jones. Yeah, I can. Yeah, I can see what I'm just a car. Don't look all the fucker. It's not July. Yes. Yes. Steep a DC Granshawn Jones. Brock preach, Tyron Woodley. Dosen Joe's or Tayga. Max Holloway. Amanda Nunez. Cyborg. We bust in this load on this one card you can get. We can still do. The ratings did that. That place would be insane. That'd be insane. That'd be one of the greatest cards of all talkers. And then on top you sprinkle in the swingle cm punk.

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       You wouldn't be able to do that one. Why? Because that one needs so much money. The one that I'm thinking about, which one? You know the one, which one? Joe? The one that was a lot of sprinkles on top, which was, you know that boxer guy, what's his name? Are you talking about Floyd money that we keep talking about? If that happened? This is, by the way, I believe you and I were the first speculate. That's publicly correct. I think that's the fight. I think that's the fight to make. I agree. I don't know if it'll ever happen, but I think it, if it does happen, it happens on its own individual card. You put a kickass card underneath it, but I don't know if you put like a UFC 200 size kickass Carter anything. No. Cause Floyd and cm punk skin cell. And also if you're Floyd just lean up from Floyd's perspective.

Speaker 1:          01:08:04       I pay me this much money, which I boatload of cash and also give me the guy who has zero experience like me and cm punk comes with a huge name, so it makes sense. It's the only fight to make for Floyd cause condo literally kill them. Yeah, you can't do that. It wouldn't be fair. It's not fair. [inaudible] light up Floyd into bunk in the same night. People would understand the difference between Connor Boxing Floyd, which you've got clearly outclassed, but he hit him like, Floyd's, I can do anything. No, it's no competition. It doesn't. It's going to be awful. It doesn't make sense. Make sense? He'll get kicked once in the legs and be like, oh my God, now I can't walk. And then he gets kicked in the same spot. I'm like, oh Jesus Christ. And his folding over and he's getting front kicked in the gut.

Speaker 1:          01:08:46       Connor's talking shit to him. Get head kicked. The bishop and then you're on that highlight reel and the UFC is using that over loop over and over. And then it takes one clinch. Just one clench and you're on on your back. If your cm punk than her fighting Floyd, I'm army crawling over flooded. You're not even go ahead and punch me, but say Stan karate style. He stand karate style and you throw sidekicks and you just walk towards him throwing sidekicks. There's so many just to the cage. Yes. Why would you even want to box him? He stand total Wonderboy side stance to stand like this, way back Liotta Machida style and just throw sidekicks, keep them off you and then when the move is, whenever it happens, get that clinch it rock fucking everything. The guy weighs 145 legitimate pounds. That's what Floyd ways.

Speaker 1:          01:09:28       Even just bear hug him and just pull them on top of me and sweep them and get full amount. I would literally just come at Floyd like this. Just walked straight forward like the terminator. Floyd can make it a welterweight. He could make welterweight and boxing. He could. That's the only problem with this fight that we're speculating is 20 pounds of weight. Are they going to fight it? Cause see a punks nuts wall? No, he was a legit sized one 70 so he would go and catch weight here. You'd have to be catch weight 60 see that's the other thing. You Drain cm punk down to one 60 and he's Foxville. Yeah, let's do that. Yeah. Well, well here's the thing. It at one 70 he doesn't have a lot of muscle, but he's got a little bit of fat so maybe can do, he might be able to do 65 he does it smart and long, you know, he takes a long time to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:14       Adjust as calories, really ramps up as cardio. Just forces himself to do an hour of cardio after every training session. Has anyone seen him lately? Other man looked in thinner? No. It's going to have to look a lot thinner to get that fight or Floyd's. He says, I don't give a fuck. I'm going to light this dude up. Cause when they're standing, when? When he's got to close the distance on cm pie, Floyd has four ounce gloves on. Are you fucking kidding me? And he's impossible to hit. He's in pot. You're not going to hit them. That's not happened to catch coming in and it's gonna beat fucking night night. Even the leg kicks like, boy, can you even kick his legs? How fast the CM punk kick. You know what I mean? We're not talking about like yachts and Clyde. That's not the move for cm punk, sir. Just do what you gotta do to get to the ground. We have a karate background. Cm punk. Yes. Much as a, I have a crowded and I'm not making fun of ill of him when he was like 13 or some shit and I guess does it count? I play dodge ball to when the band, I had a resume not on my resume. Doesn't count. Soccer player. I'm going to put that on my fucking soccer players. My Twitter handle

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       now I play. That doesn't count man. Play it. Yeah, we were hit so heartbroken man. You're right. Jesus. I don't want to throw it. It's that cold brew. This new Cobra was snacking on. God Damn. Jamie, what were you showing me right before the podcast started? About some dude who just retired because he had a brain injury. Oh yeah, there's a, an NFL running back. It was just seeing the story so I don't know too much about it, but I know who he is. His name is beanie wells. He was a running back in the NFL. Um, he had an MRI and it's showing brain injury, so he's starting his already publicly stating he's having problems with that. He was having memory loss, speech problems. How old is this gentleman? 29 I think. Oh Man. Yeah man. He's already going under treatment right now, so like he's, he would be one of the first people I've heard of that is already getting treatment for what I guess they can tell now about potential, so what do they do?

Speaker 2:          01:12:12       How do, how are they treating it? There he is handsome fellow, former cardinals are be beanie wells dealing with traumatic brain injury, so they know for a fact that he has it, so he must be one of the recipients of one of the newer tests that allows them to see while the person's alive because it used to be, they used to have to do an autopsy autopsy to find out what's wrong with what's wrong with your brain. There's this quote, he says he has plot some plaques separation [inaudible]. It shows that you've experienced some sort of Tbi and says when you have plaques. Yeah. Separation shows you've experienced some traumatic brain injury? Obviously that traumatic injury for me would come from playing football. Not only that, they had some cells tacked on to that separated plaque that I needed to get under control. What does that mean?

Speaker 2:          01:12:54       You think? I mean, extra cells. I only know as being bad cancer, cancer type stuff. Right. Still on out of the woods yet, but I'm hopeful. Wow. Well, at least he sees it. Right. You know, and he, he got ahold of it. Now, when did he stop playing? Uh, pretty recently. And he would also be in Columbus, which would be at Ohio state where they have the, not only like the James Cancer plays, but I think they're doing the tests are some of the early tests on this. Oh, remember correctly? You even told me it was at Ohio state. Maybe not. I don't, I don't know. I talk too much. I forget some of the Shit I say. I really do. I've realized that, um, when someone asked me what podcast, I'm Eric Weinstein and, uh, Heather hying we're on, and I had to think about it, it's like 1080. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:13:40       and I thought about, look, how the fuck could I ever remember what I said, if they were all one hour a thousand different conversations plus fight companions or this is, I think it is Ohio state. There's a thing, and this is on their medical Wexner center medical website. They have, uh, advanced imaging and neuro sensitive care and Rehab services. Right? We're talking brain trauma. Yeah. We're talking about that football player that, um, just got tested. He had plaque separation and his brain. How long did he play for Jamie? Uh, so probably about seven years I think in the NFL. He's off. See the exception though, you know, there's obviously a prom, but he's, he's definitely the exception. I wonder, you know, mom's around for so long, it's been around for so long. I think a lot of people just live with it, you know, and did the thing is um, what does that apo a three apo e three something that Rhonda Patrick was talking about like a, it was a gene, like somehow the way it expresses itself.

Speaker 2:          01:14:40       Um, I know I'm butchering this for the science people going crazy, but science people, it's more likely that you would get a traumatic brain injury if you have it or you do not have is actually tests for the timers. Disease. Yeah. Early onset Alzheimer's. Yeah. There's a test you can take to see if you're more susceptible to us CT than others. Yeah. Here it is. It says there are three types of apo e genes called Ailes allows apo e two e three e three and e four. Everyone has two copies of the gene in the combination that terms your apo geno type. Um, the [inaudible] Lal, I hope not. Fuck that up. Probably am fucking hell. L E l e right is the rarest form the APO e and carrying some one copy appears to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's by up to 40%. Whoa.

Speaker 2:          01:15:28       Apo e three is the most common Lao and doesn't seem to influence risk. The APO e four Lal, I know I'm fucking that word up. Someone's screaming at their phone right now present and approximately 10 to 15% of people increases risk for all timers and lowers the age of onset. That's what I think they think is connected to traumatic brain injury. I think it was apo e four whatever gene I got. I've been knocked out so many times. I'm happy as fuck cause that one, whatever that is, get that one. It's made me so much happier. Well aren't you happy though, because your life is going great. Don't you think that's a factor? I think there's something, there's something to be said for that that people don't look. Everybody knows that having good friends in your life, having a good relationship, having a family and having a career that you're happy with, all those things make you feel good.

Speaker 2:          01:16:16       It's one of the reasons why people strive for them. Don't you think that that has an impact on overall happiness? I think, you know with, with football players and fighters, MMA box or stuff like that. I think one of the advantages I have is I found my passion and I'm in pursuing that so I don't, you know, it keeps me happy and it keeps my brain, I have to be super creative so it's keeping me sharp. I think a lot of athletes and soldiers for that matter that they get done with this high stress high, you know, rush a job and they get put in the real world and they can't, they can't find their lane and it's, oh, it's PTSD or oh, it's brain trauma at CT now you're just depressed man. Because you went from being the superstore for doing this high level job to fit in with siding out. It's tough. Well, I don't think it's, no you're not. I think it's both. It's a factor. It's a factor, but it's not. It's, there's a lot of physical factors. 100% gel. I'm just saying I've around blasts

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       100% 100% that's a legit issue. I'm just saying if, if people are as fortunate as me to go through this sort of traumatic fighting career and then find a passion, your true passion, you'd be way better off. And I have no advice for that. I don't know what to tell you, but if you could find something you're into, it's definitely gonna help you. I think for everything in life, you know, if you were a dentist, so you didn't want to be a dentist anymore and you really wanted to make paintings, if you could have, you could really figure out a way to do that. You'd be happier. Like whatever that thing is. It's just really hard for some people to find a thing. And that's one of the things that I've talked to people. They go, I don't, I don't really know what I want to do with myself.

Speaker 1:          01:17:48       And then they asked me for advice. My man, no one told me. It doesn't really work like that. Like you got to figure that out. There's literally not a book you can read and we can talk to that's gonna point you in the right direction. Here's the, here's the best piece of advice. Take some action, take some action, do something. If that doesn't work, correct it, find something else. But keep, keep moving, keep moving. When you're sitting at home going, what do I do? That's when it's a problem. And when you're texting your friends going, hey, got any advice for me? My advice to you is don't ask me for advice. Don't DME, DME for advice. Shit together. I don't do that to people. I don't call people up and say, hey man, which they do. I just do things correct. Just go do something.

Speaker 1:          01:18:25       Agree. And it might not be the thing you might say. Ah, okay, well now I know I don't want to do that. You could try something out. Don't be afraid to fuck up though. I fuck up all the time. You got to got it down. You've got to take risks. You got to, people are so scared. They want to be in that harbor. Want to stay safe? Keep me under the blanket cushions. Oh that's north. Which is weird cause I take risks when it comes to my family and my friends. Even with Brian or Tayga. I'm like, don't do this. Don't do that. I'm super light. But with myself, I'm pretty reckless. But with them I'm like, no, no, no, no. Wait, please wait. Just strange. What do you think is steep, pained and DC? I think it's literally the greatest super fight the UFC has ever made.

Speaker 1:          01:19:04       I'm so excited for it. It's an amazing fight when you see a how well DC handled Volk on olds demeanor and you see what Steve Bay did to Francis. It almost like makes sense while John is out and Brock is busy, thrown his piss into a microwave, he's got that same pump system that I use out there and my flip day, he pinches into that thing. They strain that bitch. And the reason why it's a super fight twos, because how tough is this car, this fight to break down? Like if someone's like, I'm positive, steep is going to win. You're like, no, you're not on positive. DC is going to take him down. No, you're not. And the thing is it's like, well now dcs, find the heavyweight. Yeah, he's undefeated heavyweight and I'm a fucking fight at heavyweight. He's actually one of the best of you.

Speaker 1:          01:19:46       It's well done. Imagine if one day we see Novitsky he's wearing all diamonds and shit. Just appalling cleanser. That was what I would do if I was in bed ski. If with the day Brock Lesnar gets in the UFC, I will show up in a full fur coat with a giant diamond encrusted cross pimping, pimping pimp diamonds on every finger, Gucci sunglasses indoors and just sit there. Nobody told me how to dress. Just sit there like gay. Got. We did another one. It was just sit in his cage side. Imagine just like, that's the way to do it. So everybody knows like super obvious. If you have to bet on a Joe John Jones, Brock Lesnar the fights happening. Huh? Boy I hope so.

Speaker 3:          01:20:32       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:20:32       I hope so. I if I was Brock, I wouldn't take that fight. Really? No. Get a fight under your belt first. We don't have time for that bullshit. There's don't warm up as Brock Lesnar fight warmup. I know. It's really hilarious. Francis. Oh Jesus. What do you want to do? The poor man. I'm going to w Frances or Brock Brock. If I'm Bronx. Excuse me sir. I'm blast doubling luck. I'm at fucking Minnesota. You right through that chiller or in the first round. Francis is superhuman. Freak strong, and you got to wear them out before you could take them down, but you have to stay conscious long enough to where I'm out for. You. Take them down and he's throwing new, clear Putin style fucking head, and when they land, you're gonna see sparks. That's going to remind you of Alistair Overeem and you're going to go, holy fuck. You play that game. If you play that game. I fought Brock Lesnar. I am blasto. I'm coming with a single it on on blast. Definitely through Francis. Brock is older. He's, he'd be the best wrestler that France has ever faced.

Speaker 1:          01:21:36       Who's that? Stevie Brock. No, Brock. Brock's the best rest of that thought. You say he beat the best. I'm saying it'd be the best wrestler that Francis ever fought. Oh, that's a problem. Oh yeah, for sure. It's also ginormous, right? But he doesn't have the standup at Acumen. That's deep bay does. Like Brock is just not as good in the stand up. We don't need any of that. So you definitely need a little Nah, you gonna need a little Nah liquid. Allister did. Allister kept him off. Remember that for a hot second. Then I also want to play the rock 'em sock. 'Em robots and got flatlined. No, no. When Alister beat up. Oh Guy. We're talking about two different alleys. Jesus Christ sir. How dare you tell her how it to burrim talking about the Uber took Bro, don't we? It was a moment in time when you and I get together with my mouth salivates we talking about Uber.

Speaker 1:          01:22:21       It was a moment in time. A special moment. He was the scariest man on earth. Yeah, there was. He was. It was a weird moment. It was like, wait a minute, what? This is real. How has that kind of that thing I was fighting then too. It kind of feel like it's a bad idea. Well, not only that, call his doctor, he had already won the k one ground pre on the strike force. He's smashed Brett Rodgers. I mean he was, he was just beating the fuck out of people, man. Brock was like, what? It was terrible fight for Brock. The awful fighting man would take down a fence and world class striking, wicked striking. Like it was a different kind of striking and it's like a much more tactical walking juice. Like we're in fucking pumping out. Ooh, like you're in fucking, what's the juice place? Jamba juice. Like get the fucking job budget,

Speaker 2:          01:23:07       but he doesn't punch as hard as Francis that's ubering back then he did. He's just Louise's no, I don't think so. I don't know man. He punched more technical, very hard. Much more tactical. But I think Francis has got some new things. Here's some powers, new levels. The Way Francis punches you is like, it's a different level now. Francis is a complete nightmare. Haver Brock Lesnar and be an awful matchup for true. It's true. But I feel like you got two giant moneymakers there. That's what I'm saying. I don't know. Trying to get it right away. We try and make money or not. Yeah, but if Brock loses, that's a wrap. Like if you lose the Francis, he loses the most terrifying. It's not like he's going on a 10 year run here. We're just trying to get our money. Oh, look at before and after.

Speaker 2:          01:23:51       That's crazy. As Christ 2009 to 2016 whoa. That's amazing. Testosterone is real people. That's more testosterone. That's that. That's that John, but not having, it's real too. We're sure. Yeah. Tough mentally to, yeah. There's not much you can do either. The other thing about it is like once your body doesn't produce anymore and you're in your late thirties like that and you've been juicing for a long time, it was like Clomid and stuff that tries to or to read each CT or HTC. What's true? Is that a mood that's a cell phone either way, hcg or something, whatever it is, but supposed to boost your testosterone naturally, but never to the levels when you're injecting that John. But juice, no, not only that though. You can't take that stuff to in the UFC. It's illegal. I'm just saying when, yeah, that's true. When I guess when he retires, he can do whatever the fuck he wants.

Speaker 2:          01:24:36       Yeah, yeah. When he retires or goes to a rise in Kim, imagine UFC lets him out of the contract and then all of a sudden he disappears for like eight months and just we here just locked in the house and ports horse meat back, just just filet of horse all day. He's eating that Canelo meat and goes back to dead lift and hanging out with power lifters. Steps out of the fucking house in Holland. Six months later, Dick tied around [inaudible] 97 yes. Yeah. I want that journey for him. I want that because I went on board of that train is only one way can happen, dude. How about Kelly and hot for fucking Clenbuterol and they're saying it's in the meat in Mexico. It is a small trace amounts and everyone's like, oh, the fights off. Trust me, it's boxing. That flight is not off. There's way too much money involved.

Speaker 2:          01:25:24       That is a real fact though, is that one particular substance he tested positive for exists in meat Clenbuterol yeah, and also it's not like a straight steroid, you know guys use it to cut weight and stuff like that and it's such a small trace amount. They're going to be fine. Yeah. That's such a great fight. Triple g canola man. It's a very good fight and it's way better than the first one. Cinco de Maya. Why do you think it's going to be better? I cause I, I think triple g didn't fight like himself. He wasn't, he has that mix in style. He's a little reserved and then you know, Canelo was moving too much. I think now that they're going to break, we're getting like the real fight now. I don't think the judges fuck this one up. You never know though. It's shady. I loved the first fight. I loved it. I thought let me too. I I thought triple g

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       one it going away though. I really thought he won. Me Too. I think a lot of people did. A lot of people thought that was a poor draw. That's why I think, you know, Chit with g coming off that drawl now there's a lot more hype with everyone's getting tuned in. The ratings are going to be better. And my boxing judges, you know, they're crooked. MMA is nowhere near as bad, but bots like did you, did you see the wild Ortiz fight? No, I thought for sure wilder was losing on the cars and like he's gonna have to get a finish. But on actual scorecards they had wild or winning, which obviously they want wilder to win, which I thought was, I was like, I did and I'm a wilder Dick Rider. I'm like, he's not looking at fight. I think they might be worse. And they're the same exact judges, a lot of the same judges that judge MMA that also or judge box and also judge MMA and they don't even know what MMA is.

Speaker 1:          01:26:50       UNDC trying to walk that tight rope of not clown and what's her name? Abalene she's a very nice lady. But as you said, so it was my mom. I don't want her to fucking piss exactly what I've nat judging. That's exactly what I said. It's so fun. You in DC just trying to balance that. She has no business being in the, in the very nice lady. But yeah, she's made some bad decisions and she also was a part all in though. She was also a part of the Canelo Alvarez triple g decision. That's the problem. Yeah, she's balling. Yeah. And she was on the wrong side of a couple of decisions that night. There was some, there was some bad ones. Super so site to some that we were like what? How did he win every round? What? Oh you didn't make any sense like some that some that literally didn't make any sense each time I'm in the UFC this past weekend there was a lot of bad decision.

Speaker 1:          01:27:36       Bad ones. Yeah. But there was like a couple of split decisions that I was like, what in the actual fuck is this? And the weight screws over the fine or they have no idea. The repercussion is such a shitty deal. Yup. Yeah. They lose half their money. Money, the money. Cause you don't know what's going on and literally you, there's no recourse. And if it's a bad decision and there's three people and one person just has literally no idea what they're doing and they give it to the wrong person, it's awful, man. It's fucking terrible and it's unnecessary. Here's the thing, it's unnecessary. There's way better methods. And one of the most better methods is one of the better methods is hire someone who was an actual martial arts expert. Like I'm Matt Hume or something like that. Someone does score like, oh you can, I'm sure there's a lot of those guys that would do it.

Speaker 1:          01:28:16       A lot of trainers out there that would do it. I think I agree. You need to have someone who specialized in mixed martial arts. She's been around the game. I don't, they don't need to be Kate side cause cage. I can't see everything. And you're also swayed by the crowd. They shouldn't be in an undisclosed location and they're watching what we see in judging the fight from the MMA fighters perspective. I think that's a good point. And I also think they should be able to see all the replays. Yes, they should see all the fight stat. So you get everything, get everything, copies, strikes and then decide. But what you're doing now, so old school, the only thing that I would disagree with, I don't think they should hear the commentary because I think the commentary can sway. I'm saying no, calm down. Calm the crowd noise. You have three expert MMA and molests watching this. Who's winning? Cause you're going to, they know the ground game, you know for that. For Tony Ferguson, Khabib let's say could be takes Tony Down and they think, oh he has a huge advantage and

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       then Tony's just whooping his ass, throws back, elbows submission game stand back up, getting taken down, but on the ground could be constantly under threat. How are you going to judge that? How are, yeah, you gotta know what you're looking at. I also think three is too small. I think it should be 10 people, 10 people. A lot of people can't qualify to have him call in. It's a real shit show how to do it all. Do did it all with the Internet. You didn't even have to be in the building to be there. 10 10 people. It's harder for three more. Yeah. But if there's two that are smart and one that's bad, you've got a shitty split decision and everybody feels weird about it. Like what would have happened if there was three more on? So can we say five 10 10 10 you're going to get the right decision almost every time because to a few people are going to disagree, but most people are gonna see it.

Speaker 2:          01:29:44       That one majority majority's going to see it this way and agree. And if it's five to five, you've got to fuck a draw in your hands. And that's rare. I'm not mad at that. And I think sometimes a fight should be a fucking draw. Draw a problems and watch it go, man, that's too close. Call. Don't fuck over Sonia than half their pay. If there's a draw, they both get their wisdom. That's how we should do. Exactly. One guy moves on and the other guy doesn't just arbitrarily so weird. It doesn't make any sense for you to draw and they have to in their contract it rematched whatever card the Raby go again. I do it again. And the fucking address here. I'm sure he's texting, you know, count. He said he's 75 minutes away. He said he found it. He says he's close. Is He?

Speaker 2:          01:30:22       I don't believe that he might be. He could. And Catlin. Brian Kidd in. So what else is going on? Um, the UFC was what's happened. What other, what other big fights are there? Um, when Yoel Romero comes in and talks to a Joey Diaz and me, he's getting ready to fight Whitaker. They're gonna, he's gonna, he's gonna fight for the title, even though he didn't make weight in the Rockhold fight. That's short notice. I don't hold that against them though. Right. Especially with his body type. God, he looked good. Get good against Rockhold. Huh? Rockhold teddy was like made out of metal. Said the guy was just ridiculously strong. Fight Rockhold for anybody. For anyone. Robert Whitaker. But yeah. Yeah. In [inaudible] with healthy needs. Man, there's a nice man. Yeah, he's gonna be tough to beat for a long time. But if someone could do it, could be ELL, but is not young, 40 years old son.

Speaker 2:          01:31:11       Every bit of it. Yeah. Who knows those Cuban birth certificates. You have no idea. That's what I saying with Ortiz. They said, oh, he's 38 when bullshit. That's the most shot out. 38 year old I've ever seen. That man has 400 amateur fights in Cuba. There's no, he's 38 to 48 he thinks so that he's not 38. There's no way you see him up close. I'm like, what the fuck? Did you see him up close? Yeah, I said the press, uh, the, uh, the Wayne's all that stuff for shelter. Did you see the fight live or did you see it on TV? No, I flew back. I supposed to work it, but I flew back. I watched 'em Kovalev beat up his friend beat the piss out of his friend. It was like his friend. It was like the guy was fighting him like he was his friend and cove low was fighting him. Like some guy fucked his girlfriend. They ass Kobo if killed a guy. Yeah. And it didn't seem, don't know mother fucker. He's a super bad motherfucker. But

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       now with that wilder or tease fight, which was, it kind of did what I think for wilder. What Joe Anthony, Joshua w against Klitschko. We're now, everyone's stuck around. So now before we didn't think we'd get Anthony, Joshua Wilder, but I think it forces Joshua's hand to fight. Wilder was before it wasn't going to happen, which that's the fight man. Why wasn't going to happen before? Because they have the will. So anti Joshua has to get through Joseph Parker first, early next month, which is a beast. Just Parker's a nightmare from New Zealand, I think. 20 [inaudible], you know, world champion, no punk. So he had to get by that and then he was going to take like one or two more fights before he fought wilder. Now you can't do that because while they're just won by emphatic. Yeah. Was like, what are you talking about? The hops on those talked about box.

Speaker 1:          01:32:38       Right now you have to take this fight. Why did they put fights like that off? Like why do they say, we'll take a cup that's boxing. Well, listen, if he has a business, if you're, if you're Anthony, Joshua was man, just like, all right, do we fight dot throughout who's 40 and oh, 39 knockouts. The nightmare of a fight for anybody, which we were probably favorites still to fight or do we fight this guy, this guy, and get paid and then fight wilder? You know, things can go wrong. Exactly. A heavyweight, Joseph Parker is no joke. Not at all. No. But yeah, things could go wrong, but I'm assuming that's their way of thinking. You know what? It's scary. I, I was jumping around off, see being around these guys, you know, I get close with guys and I know wilder and I wanted to win so bad just because it's good for the sport.

Speaker 1:          01:33:22       It's not knocking Ortiz teaser, amazing fighter, but wild. He checks all the boxes, man. He can, he can sell tickets. He's American. He, you know, he talks a lot of shit. He has a great story. Started boxing because his daughter was born with a spinal issue and couldn't walk and he just has these great stories and you want the root for that trust as well dressed as well. Diane piece knockout artists, but him and Josh was the fight man. Yeah, he has one. His last couple of fights pretty spectacularly to people are so fussy, so mad. They get so mad at me. They go, oh, oh my God. Oh, you're such a home, are you? You love wild. I'm like, well, I like Joshua to where they're like used to root for Joshua. I liked both of them are men can't respond to those people.

Speaker 1:          01:34:04       I don't respond, but he can't. Even right now you're responding well, it's way, it's my job. You know? We do that thing kind of. Yeah. You know, I like both of those guys, man. I love both of them. You can like both of them. That's when Ferguson, Tony Ferguson got mad that I put a cubs hat on. He, Tony, I thought were tall, 10th planet. I'm like, hey bro, I'm wearing the hat. Guy gives me the hat. I'm wearing it. I could be, but I like Tony like or Tayga like Frankie Egg. Want to see you guys fight. I think it'd be awesome. You're going to, there's going to be animosity. No, no doubt. If someone doesn't make weight or get her fired, I'm going to cry. Yeah, I'm blue every day. When I checked Tony's Instagram or check Khabib's, I'm like, please, please, no injuries, no injuries. Everybody keep it together. Anything crazy in there? We're not even a month away. Not even a month away. Yeah. That's a fight. Yeah. What is the date? It's March 6th it's a month and a day for a month

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       and a day. Good googly Mowgli. That fight, that fight is by far my favorite. The fight has to happen. It has to reach and it could be and then steep a DC. Those are my two fights where I'm just, I'm literally like the school blocking card. Key asset versus pedis. I forgot about that owl. I Quinta verses Paul Felder. Are you fucking Shit Dude? Yolana do Rose Joe Lowe. Lozan you want to and rose. Oh my goodness. God Damn. Evan Dunham still doing the damn thing and they gave him that monster. Yeah. Tie some off. Well they couldn't get an, and trying to fight tight. They couldn't get married back. Tie some off a good fight for a long time. He's very, very directly that gentlemen. Yeah. And he's having a real hard time getting matchups with Evan Dunham. Doesn't give a fuck. I bet you anything. Your boy Connor's there because his boy Artem low blobs fighting and prednisone.

Speaker 2:          01:35:55       Khabib makes sense. Yeah. Lobe Office Fighting Cause Sarah's, that should be fine. Hello Bob Fan man. It's tough dude. Salty record at 14, 14 but that's life. Yeah, he's um, it's interesting because there's two schools of thought with him and Connor is that, you know, that he's strong and he's powerful and he's a good sparring partner for Connor. But I've also heard people say no kind of likes him because Connor can fuck him up. And Connor sparks. Yeah. So God damn tough. Like having a really tough sparring partners. Probably a great idea. Both. Yeah. He's not exactly a technician, but he thought, I'm so damn tough. It's hard to, he hits hard. He said, you got to watch your p's and q's at all times. He, I'm sure he's a great training partner and he's loyal to, he's not going to hurt you. That's it. Super important. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:36:40       Especially now in Carter's life. That's got to be real important. And I mean, how many people were just constantly trying to get the best of them and so on. No hashtag no new friends either. There's no new guy sparring with him. I was, um, looking at this, uh, this dude, a couture row on k one here. I'm going to send it to you, Jamie. This dudes, they were doing the exact kind of sparring that I fucking hate to see anyone do where they were literally just going at each other out and then, um, could Taru connected with the giant bomb and knocked him out. Yes, he did. It was awful. That's that old school fighting, man. I'm going to send this to Jamie. Hang on a second. Super old school fighting. Well, it's just, it's unfortunate when people choose to train like this because this is a real out that this guy suffered and it wasn't an accident.

Speaker 2:          01:37:31       Like this guy was teeing off on him trying to knock them out. I just sent it to you in a text message. It's not like the guy was knocked out because um, you know, he just got caught with a freak punch off the Gaba and sparring. Watch this shit. We get those guys in the back of it. We have this look at this or they're playing for keeps and then walks away. Like it doesn't give a fuck. It's so weird, man. Hey, don't get out of it. Look at this guy. Doesn't like that. Very good. Who he's fighting. No, no, he doesn't. And mean he is swinging from the Oh, that dude's like k owed. Yeah. He's flatline. Yeah. How do you say his last name? That's that you're talking to me. I'm the worst at as to how do you, how do you think it's it? Tele k one, two Carew tuck heroin to Carol.

Speaker 2:          01:38:26       Yeah. You don't want this. And then he posted that. Yup. It's awful, right? No, it's just a tool moods. Awful. Well, it's just me. Maybe it wasn't him sparring. I don't know who was getting k. I would like that. But that should be an example of just what not to do. A hundred or are you, what does the [inaudible] shoot box back in fucking 97 what are you doing? Does it show the translation? No. Who Cares? Either way. Either way. I don't post it. That's how it used to be. That's how guys spar got back in the day. Like for sure. Educate your side. I know this why when you see something like that today, like hard to see now that's not, it's not smart. It's not good for you and it's not a good way to train. You're not learning from that. And she got a break all your toys.

Speaker 2:          01:39:02       So people go, oh, you fight like that and now we're good man, we're good. Or You have to be a guy who can hang in there in that gym and do that, but all of you are going to take unnecessary damage. Can you do it? Yeah, you can do it. That's how we used to do it. Everyone has to do the can do it, but is it smart to do it? Definitely not. No. That's not the right way to do it. Especially at his level. We know you're tough, man. You'll need to knock guys out. Finding the K one. What are you doing? Yeah. Did you watch all the glorious past weekend? I'm not huge into glory jugs. I watch all comments. Are you? I know. I know. You don't like kickboxing. It's all right to me. I do. I enjoy it. I appreciate the art, stuff like that, but I, I was, I was really into k one and when it was in its prime, but with glow I can't, it's hard for me getting the glory and there's some amazing guys in there.

Speaker 2:          01:39:44       I'm just, I only have so much time on my hands were goalies. Not that's shorty. Yeah. I Dunno. To me, I like it better than boxing to me. I dare you. I'm sorry. I do. It's like, I don't even know. I'm being honest. I appreciate it. We'll get glory. Fight to me is more interesting than a real good boxing match. Crazy like kicks crazy like knees. I like Moyie Thai even more. More than boxing. Yup. A good box. A match. If you rather watch that than Canelo triple g you got your God. Wow. That's an exceptional. What's a lifetime match? You know that wild Ortiz fight, man, one of the best I've ever seen. But like say if it was like bull cow versus San Chai. Yeah. I would be just as excited about it. Yeah, that's fair. You know what I mean? Like those two levels.

Speaker 2:          01:40:28       Yeah. That level. That is not so extreme. That's crazy fight. Yeah. You'd want to see what happens. Yeah. I don't know. I just, again, I can appreciate it when there's a good fight. I'm down by, I don't, I'm not going to shut down my knight in order pizza and watch a glory. I will. I will for sure. But yeah, I don't miss it, which is weird. Which I, I don't miss any MMA. UFC bellatore I don't miss any boxing. There's Sally shut everything down. Did you get excited about the Kovalev fight or was it just like, Nah, I get excited about it. Anytime. Yeah. Super excited about it. Like this past weekend I was so, I was just so happy because I knew I had, I had fricking showtime boxing on with wilder for short tees, which is a great fight. And then you also had UFC two 22 so when you can in that ended before the event events.

Speaker 2:          01:41:16       I get to see all of it. That makes my weekend, man. Did you see that dude? Uh, Alexander Hernandez starch, but Neil Darr, huge. Did he effort dare you? She's hitting a rough patch. How about your boy Hector [inaudible] x one bar. That wasn't good. Where are you at on that cheap shot? Cheap shot you think? Yeah. I think it was a natural actress Combo you can get away with. I agree. The second punch, he knows the bell's already rung. The first one I said, right, you're, you're in motion. But that's that second one that knocked them out. That's where I got to draw the line. Yeah, it's healthy. It's bad die. But it's also a natural counter to kick like that, to throw that straight right with the left hook. So maybe there's that, but you can't have the fight carry on. We definitely naturally fired back, but he knew in his head that the bell had rung and he fired back anyway.

Speaker 2:          01:42:03       I mean that's what it, that's what happened. Why did he do it? I don't know, but here's the thing. We can't speculate. We don't know. No one knows. It was on purpose. While you know as the bell rings and rules the rules real clear, the bell rings to do, throws a punch and then another punch after the bell, a hundred percent foul. There's no gray area like that. They're going to appeal. That to me is crazy and act two was saying something like the guy was talking. He was fine. Just keep saying what happened? Where am I? Yeah, that's what's the CB dollar? He said, yeah, he said it over. I kept saying that. He was saying I was letting everybody know because he was saying it over and over again and we all know what that is. We've all seen that when a guy gets knocked out and just keep saying what happened, what's a nightmare?

Speaker 2:          01:42:44       It happens so often. Yes. That is what always happens when people get KOD suit. They go, Oh shit, what happened? You don't remember it. And you tell them and then five minutes later what happened and then you tell him, why am I here? What happened? Like they forget over and over again all night. I got to stay up hectors in a tough spot because he's lost five in a row now. So I don't, I'm not sure what they're gonna do with him. Well, I mean I would imagine if CB wants to do a rematch, they would do a rematch. Cause is, there'd be some interest in that fight because either one of those guys is not generating a ton of interest. Hector's lost a lot of fights, a lot of fights. These last two, he got knocked out by Mark Hart. Remember that? Yeah, that was bad. That was bad.

Speaker 2:          01:43:24       And that was, it seemed to me like one of those fights where he thought Mark Hart was done, you know, lasting to go donate retired. Yeah. Officially she retired. Yeah. I'm glad. I'm glad I'm retired. But there's a thing that happens to fighters where you know, there's can't take a shot anymore. They just been doing it too long. It's just a fact. And so guys go after him, but the last thing to go with a guy like Nate is power. Yeah. He knocks out CB after CB. Um, you know, can you see became back and who did he be? I thought CV one, two in a row and then they got Hector or did he lose it? One in decision, but I'm pretty sure after mate he won one. Well, you know, he got fucked up in an elevator accident. He's in a lawsuit with the UFC over it.

Speaker 2:          01:44:04       Yeah. He's like permanently fucked up. Is that that one happened? Yeah, he was on an elevator and it just dropped to elevate. It just dropped and slammed onto the bottom. I'm sorry. How's at the UCS Brown? It's, I don't think he's in a lawsuit with the z not am I crazy is a lawsuit. I think with the hotel, I thought it was the UFC. Maybe I'm wrong. It doesn't make sense if the elevator and then I have misinformation because it wouldn't make sense come after the UFC. If it was a whole hotel and you didn't know that it was the, the elevator accident. I knew it was the elevator. So yeah, it doesn't make sense that they'd come after the year. I only come after you have sex. What I heard, but it apparently there was quite a few people in that elevator and when he dropped, a lot of them got fucked up like more than three or four people in the elevator.

Speaker 2:          01:44:44       But he got fucked up bad. Was it a Steve Wynn? I don't know. I don't know who owned it. I don't know where it was. Do not remember. That's such a shame for that though. Yeah, but he did go and fight again, so they would probably be arguing like, hey, you're still professional because what? I was getting sick because he's in that law suit. Then you fight this weekend, the courtrooms can be like, hold up, you're saying your packs and issue, they fought Hector lumbar you're talking about, that's true, right. The best argument would be did not fight until the lawsuits settled and wait, shoot some stem cells in there. Down in Panama. Yeah. So listening tiny. See you ever standing on the headphones?

Speaker 2:          01:45:23       Wyndham hotel in Cleveland dumps. Don't stay at window or do so they'll a sue the shit out of those people. We'll see what happens. But yeah, the p the o elevator apparently was getting funky on people before and uh, people were still riding it don't, don't more people die in elevators. Cause when they, they, they're like talking to her friend. They assume the elevators here and then walking. The elevator's not, then they go down. More people die like that. Then really even imagine yet why the word doesn't come our open because the door, cause it thinks you know something's wrong and they're like, yeah, and they fall to their death. It's a bad one. So always look at the elevators there. That's fucked up. Way to end it. Shitty deal.

Speaker 2:          01:46:03       You don't want to go out like that. No. I heard a story about a dude who got trapped in an elevator in the elevator, went up and he was trapped in the door in the elevator, went up and just shared them in half. Oh yeah. I saw that. And final destination to maybe that's what it was. And I made it up now. I'm pretty sure it was real. That'd be a terrible way to go. It's like that actor who was in Star Trek and he was in Alpha Dog. He was, he lived right up here, man in Hollywood, Hollywood hills. He lives on, uh, on an incline and it was getting out of his jeep to, to close the garage door and he didn't put the, the jeep and park and it rolled up, killed him, rolled over and killed him. Trapped against the garage door. Young actor to phenomenal actor.

Speaker 2:          01:46:47       Ah, fuck. Wow. Baxter on the elevator, one leg in the elevator, one late in the second floor. He was helping the occupants get off the elevator when all of a sudden shot upwards beheading him. That's it. His body fell into the second floor. Lobbies had fall onto the floor of the elevator, his head and the two remaining pastures in the elevator shot up to the ninth floor and one of the passenger described the scene. I can't get out of my mind. The head was there, the bar, but the body wasn't. He still had the Walkman earphones on his head. Holy Shit. There've been many problems with the elevator and the service repairman was at the building that day to work on it. The elevator had been inspected November 1st, 1994 and passed the inspection. The blue dog. Shit. That's a way to go, baby. Not Good, painless though guests, but you will be awake for a couple seconds. You know they say once you get chicken, right. That doesn't make sense to me though because how come you not awake when you get choked out?

Speaker 2:          01:47:45       Right? Well, because when you, when you get decapitated, right, everything's still finding some of the energy still up there firing so you can see, maybe I heard about the chicken. It didn't have any head live for 18 months without a noggin. After farming, a failed attempt at slaughter axed off the head of missed the juggler vain. We really, we really don't know, right? When people lose their heads, shake hands are fucking dinosaurs, man. The Shit. I've said that many, many too many times, but that kind of shit is what you need to see. Just realize this is not, that's not person. Although a pterodactyl is not a dinosaur. It's so strange to me. I know. I think Tara doctors might've had feathers. They don't know. They're thinking now that a lot of dinosaurs had feathers, but when you think about what a terra data is, we always assume it had like bat wings, but now that they think that dinosaurs had feathers, I wonder if they giant bird.

Speaker 2:          01:48:33       Yeah. I wonder if they've decided to look into that and look it at as a possibility. You ever see or see that giant picture that it's the t rex covered in feathers? Yeah. That shit out of my face didn't look like that bitch. They might've covered raptors covering. They had feathers. They've looked pretty dope too, man. You seen the PA? Have you seen the pictures dating that bullshit? T-Rex covered in feathers. Yeah, that one's furry. It was cute. Be Willing elements. Cool. Yeah. See, um, that one we, we showed it before it's out here, Bozeman, Bozeman Science Museum or some shit in Bozeman, Montana. Pretty cool place. And they have, uh, a replica of what they think are wrapped or could have looked like if it was covered in feathers because they think it's very possible that that's what those things looked like. Remember Jamie?

Speaker 2:          01:49:22       There was, it was on the floor. There was a, an actual model. We pulled up the image before. I mean if you go to images and some science shit for the feathers, but if that's what they think because um, they found some that have feathers, they know that they've got some fossils that have like very clear indentations where feathers must've been, well then everything I grew up on with dinosaurs is wrong. Well, they think that's true anyway. They used to think the t rex was a Predator and now they think it's a scavenger. I think this is vegetarian. No, they think he just waddled around just crow. Like that's why the teeth are so big, crushed dead animals that are just laying around. That's it right there. That's what I think that thing looked like, which is kind of even more nightmarish, more freaky big life feathered fucking lizard that runs and gutsy with its claws.

Speaker 2:          01:50:07       My brains trying to analyze it. It doesn't really work well cause how we know dinosaurs, you know they have an eagle man. I mean eagle is a lot like a fucking dinosaur. It just, it has a hatchet for a head instead of instead of teeth. Yeah, but you look at an ostrich, you look at their legs and shit. You can see dinosaur in it. Hundred percent feet. Yeah. But nobody has teeth like that. There's not a single bird that has like leopard seal type teeth. You know God leopard seal on underappreciate. Angela things mean as fuck. One of the coolest animals of all time. We were on the scooters and went down. There's all these leopard seals. There's some people taking pictures of some agent. Dude walked up, got nose to nose with this thing. I told my brother you could get your camera out cause that thing is a full rip his face off and this could be awesome.

Speaker 2:          01:50:54       God, they're fucking killers, man. Third Leopard. You know what I'm saying? Like the Leopard for for a reason. But you know, I didn't even know they were a real thing until I watched that march of the penguins movie and went, what? You know they're real. I didn't, I didn't know what a fucking re leopard seal was. I'd never heard of it. Other gangster and they haven't Skinner cause since a kid I was in Mexico and there's one going up in the water, I thought, oh cute look, it's like the ones I see on cartoons and my dad's friend who was a navy was like, do not go in the water. Those things are mean as fuck. I was like, really? He's like, yes, they're out there fucking killing shit right now. Yeah, they've eaten people before. There's one of them, either poor penguin, a scientist, actually a female scientist in a rare attack got killed, I want to say about 10 years ago.

Speaker 2:          01:51:40       It was, things are gangster. They were pretty stunned because they have giant mounds and huge teeth will look like with his mouth closed there. Look so fucking cute. Like, hey buddy. That's what the Asian dudes doing. Nose to nose with the Spaghetti. I buddy now get me a picture of his teeth like right above with his mouth open. Go large on that. That's not even a good one. I think it looks like a tremor. Yeah, right there. Oh, Jesus Christ. It's like tremors. Look at that man. I mean that is, that doesn't look like a real thing. That looks like a fake animal. It looks like the movie Trevor gets shitty. CGI and tremor. That's Alexa. Yeah, there was earthquakes cause it has worms. Look at underground. Just think the movie's awesome. Shout out to Kevin Bacon. I was thinking this about the Oscars. Like go to that one in the lower left. Look at these fucking teeth. He looks right to me. I'll kick your teeth, bro. Sheer fish dock. He's like, I'd be really happy to eat your ass hole 100%. Want to take a bite out of your Dick. Ever said, man, they're fucking killers. We're going to say about the Oscars though. Oh, I was thinking in the killers. No, I was thinking like, when are we no one, it's no one can possibly see all

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       the movies because we keep adding to the library every week. No movies come out, they don't take movies away. You have to hit a certain period where they're going to preview that movie. So you're up for the awards. And that's not what I mean. I don't care about the Oscars. I don't care what the awards were saying. The number of movies that we produce as the human race is fucking crazy. And it's never ending. Like every year they put out more and movies don't go away. So they just, the database, just stacking and stacking and stacking up the fall. And it's only been happening for a hundred years. Yeah, I mean, and that was silent in the beginning. Right? So there's been a hundred years of these movies just stacking up and all the premises. Like if you think about premises, like the pro, the robots get smart and they want to kill the people.

Speaker 1:          01:53:31       Okay. Oh, the monkeys get smart and they want to kill the people. Okay. Like there's all these premises that just go, oh, there's worms. They live on the ground that caused earthquakes. I get great movie. Like this is so many of these. Amen. Immediately. So many like, like it's must be so hard to come up with an original premise for a movie. There's so many fucking movies like you think it's hard to come up with a new joke or a new premise for a joke. Well, the white think movies. What do you think? You get like a re creation of Jumanji rocky and Predator. Like they're running out of ideas. How many buddy buddy movies can we see? Can we put the Rock Kevin Hart's? I'll be God damn movies. It was just the regurgitation of all the same shit we've already seen. Yeah. Yeah. It's, there's so many movies get, there's not that many paid actors.

Speaker 1:          01:54:13       Is there like it's a struggle city less than 1% make it living, acting, but there's a juggle in movies. Is it less than 1% less less than 1% make a living really? Can Movies of all actors? Yes. Wow, that's crazy. Like a quality living of all the actors. Less than 1% that's pretty crazy. Crazy thick. La Comics make a legit living. Can you make comics are the difference being that for a comic it's more up to them. Correct. Some more up to them to go. And you're a good piece of proof for that. Obviously you have the boost of being famous from the UFC and then being famous from your podcast. Those two, two things helped you as a boost but also the hustling. And that's the thing that like an actor can hustle, but you have to be hired. They gotta be hired to do something and there's a million moving pieces.

Speaker 1:          01:54:58       1 million you gotta track. Well, your test. Well people have to like, you gotta be right for the Royal. You could just go up on a showcase night and do like 15 minutes and kill and you're in the money, you know, acting to mother fucker hard Gig to get good at too, you know, acting. Yeah. I think like God to get good at, like Daniel Day Lewis style was watching. There will be blood the other day and I was just thinking like this guy like the butcher hooding out so many. Yeah. Ooh, in New York. What does that gangs in the area, but I forgot how good there will be. Blood was, um, I watched it the other day in a hotel and uh, I was uh, near where it happened because I was doing gigs in Fresno and Bakersfield and uh, I didn't know that, but that to hatch a p mountains,

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       that's where there will be bloods all about. That's where they were drilling for oil. That's right over there. Amazing movie, Dude. I think it's funny sometimes fighters, whoever, athletes go home, I'm going to go to Hollywood, get into act. I'm like, Ma, you need to sit in on a class where you, you need to watch someone do like a dramatic role and see if it's for you. I mean, you're talking about it's a legit craftsmen. Some people are just good at this. There's a thing that they're doing where you're, you are, you're compelled by their words peddled by where they're doing and it's not easy to gift, you know? It's not easy to achieve that spot. Not a lot of guys do it. No, it's a true art that that's why it's so tough to get cast in those roles in TV and movies. There's a reason why it's so.

Speaker 2:          01:56:24       We've got amped up. I've been watching that Viking show. You watch that Viking show that's on history, right? All in baby. Yeah. You get on apple. I got on iTunes. It's fucking good, man. It's good show and it keeps getting better and they're really good actors. I'm on season two right now. I need some shows, man. I ran out while you seen punisher on Netflix. I have not changed your life. It's that good. It's, you would love it. It's a lot of shoot 'em ups Helia like legit. I just don't like action. That doesn't do anything for them. I like a good story. Yeah. Punisher stope rent. What went through El Chapo went through narcos. Dual work. You've never seen the wire. Have you ever seen the wire seeing the wire? I get like season five, that's all there is. I just did it. Release it in HD, so if you haven't seen it you could watch it.

Speaker 2:          01:57:06       Some people say grace, it's probably the best series ever. Ever. Yeah. That's a strong statement. Easier for you to say because I haven't seen it. You fuck. That's true. It is true. That is. It is right. Some people are making number one that and soprano's. Right. I've seen as a problem number one. Well that's a problem. Her son, I saw one episode of the wire. Well I've seen half an episode of Sopranos. Sopranos was the show that got me into binge watching but not binge because you know, watched every Sunday whenever it was on or whatever it and HBO night with your girl. It was a big, it was a big deal to sit and watch the sopranos. I was like, boy, you would go to the fucking time I was with game of Thrones. It's Brian here. Yeah. He has some poor electric car that he half charges.

Speaker 2:          01:57:55       How often you think Brian fully charged? Is that car just in the shop? Cause he's like ran into a wall or some shit. He cheats. His car is like shit. And then he goes, dude, you think I should get a Porsche like you and Rogan? Like no, absolutely not. Absolutely not. That's not the guy for you. He's hitting full on midlife crisis. Let's, let's encourage it. No, I want them to get a yellow viper like in braces. Like I want to be that guy in a Shit Tan and way. Ooh, Viper. Now he doesn't know how to drive enough for a viper but he, he should drive something that has some balls. Yeah, Tesla's bummed me out. I like the message. That's just not the car for me. Does that make any noise problem? The fact that it doesn't make any noise. Don't know why. I'm just too used to noise too. I know we sound like two cavemen right now, but that doesn't have that v eight or that fee. 10 noise, the fees six and let's say bowl that exhaust,

Speaker 1:          01:58:46       there's nothing and I, you know what, it's pissing me off lately. Car Manufacturers have been adding noise to their cars, like the Maserati. They put it in this in the speakers. What? Yes. In what cars? Bmw m three m four does it. They put in the speakers sound. They pumped sound through the speakers. That's a bitch. As the engine goes up, it comes. Some of it's coming in through the speakers. It's like pan abroad as a girl. It's apparently some guys have figured out a way how to cut that out. I think what you do turbocharge cars, turbocharged car. Can I say that five times turbo car, turbo charged cars. When you have forced induction, forced hot air induction, it makes the car a much quieter. Doesn't sound nearly as like throaty and rumbly like my gt three, you know raw. That thing sounds because it's naturally aspirated and you also get instantaneous feedback from the, from the throttle response, the GTA.

Speaker 1:          01:59:38       That's what you want. That's what you want. When you get into turbo chargers is all about turbo lag, which is why they have twin turbos. They have one turbo on the low end, one turbo on the high end. But even at the very best implementations of turbo chargers, there's still a perceptible lag. Slight lag. Slightly getting better and better though much about Porsche's. Ridiculous. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, they get, they're definitely better than they used to be. Dude. How the fuck even up in cars? Uh, comedians in cars getting coffee. Oh I dunno not, no, I did Jay Leno show. I've done enough car things. That's true. But let's take the new Porsche and get on there so I can't believe you're from Newport. Literally. I was like, um, I, I want, I hit you about the podcast. I'm just here to see the car and he didn't bring it has an oil leak.

Speaker 1:          02:00:21       I know. Yeah. Well you buy, it's not new. It's 1991, 1991, nine six four something. I wanted to uh, fuck around with one of those older cars. I like those. Love it. They're small. They're real small. That's one of the weird things about it when you're around it, like those things at tiny a driver's car. Yeah. I love it. Cause you're not going to see it. No one has it at the, it's custom to you to Ben as ride. There's more of them now than they have been before. People getting a little older cars. Thanks to your boy Magnus Walker. Chris Harris had something funny to me. He said, why is it the four years ago I didn't give a shit about nine six force now I think that the best looking cars ever, there's the, it goes to Porsche goes through these phases where this one's cool.

Speaker 1:          02:01:01       Yes. So the 68 to 78 73 it's just these weird phases. Well those long hood cars are kind of always the best looking ones. That 19 like 67 to like 70 early seventies like 72 73 you know they had that long hood doesn't ones that magnus is really into. He's done on a fruit. A few of those. We redid them. He made them cool too. Yeah. Oh yeah. For sure. Well his style like that, that's another level more raw than when I'm dealing with magnus. Yeah. Because his style of, well he has a nine, six, four, two but a lot of what his older cars where, where those 1969 1970 ones and those, he

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       would redo those and those cars don't wait dawg. Shit, they wait like 2000 pounds. Not like the Porsche purest think like they're not really into the singers or the Magnus Walker. You know what I'm saying? I think your car's in the middle of that, I think. Yeah, it's not modified. It's not like a singer, which is completely different and saying he's got a carbon fiber body. I actually think uh, singers that they might be getting, there's a law supports took a lawsuit out of them because they're selling the Porsches, but they're taking the Porsche logo off, put a singer one on now she's in washes suing them. They have an issue with it. Yeah. That's interesting. I thought they liked it because it was just like bringing back interest in. I think they lot worship before you started making it the singer. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          02:02:18       Yeah. Because what he's doing is taking a nine, six four which is that same year that I'm talking about, and then he puts all this other stuff on it and be set up the suspension and beefs up the engine like impossible to get to their show sick. Well now he has a new one that's starts at one point $5 million. Is that it? Jesus Christ. Fuck we did. I was seeing it. There's a limited number of them they're going to make. It has a 500 horsepower naturally aspirated engine. It's got giant fender flares. They just see if you could find it saying [inaudible] you're in. Wait till you take a look at this thing. Sometimes that like when you send me pictures of Kaiser getting made some dumb. I see. It makes me mad. They're so sick. It makes you mad. Like just not enough cars in the world for me.

Speaker 2:          02:03:03       Yeah. What is it about cars? I know cars and girls they'd like, you'll see it. You're like God damn right. It just speaks to DNA and it's, it's uh, it's not all men. Callan, Callan to come in here. You could show them that cause see the dressing room. I mean I've had guys walking around the gym see him cause he's [inaudible] he hits that punching thing you have, cause you gotta break it. He's got karate power or would go, you know what I would but my wrist. Yeah. Maybe it was that. But this, I mean some men don't get into it, but it's so universal with men. It's just, it's so normal that men like really get into cars. Why is that? I don't know. I don't know what it is. A battle, especially V eights, right. I'm not the type of guy where I'll see a car and my brother's supercar to go that thing you're, you're quite stressed out on the track.

Speaker 2:          02:03:52       I'm like, I don't give a shit about the track man. There's guys who are like those track guys and I'm just like a road guy. Fun Driving car fast enough. But looks great. All about looks and performance tracking. A lot of people are track guys. We should go to the track. The Porsche. Yeah, we go there. We have to take their cars though. Fuck up their tires. Yeah, that's true. Not Yours. That's true. He can get gt three, gt two, eh. All right, let's do it. Let's do that. That's the, that's the second. Come on son. That does make a dick thing up. Porsche nine six, four dls and this thing is insight. A better looking car than that though. You know what I'm saying? Well I'm a, I'm going to be honest. Those Fukes wheels, I always felt like they're not good enough for that body style.

Speaker 2:          02:04:36       I like the look how the wheel wells in that. I always felt like their classic, those folks are quite late and they have a center locking hubs to see that look in the fuck that body on that thing. They'll fee Ooh and the tail on the back. That's the only reason I bought my car cause the ducktail look at the back end. All my God, that might be one of the best looking cars ever, ever, ever. Was the interior like done that to me. Oh it's phenomenal. It's orange. It's, you're going to be orange. I said look at the center locks man. And like people will say, all be spoke the interior. Look at that. Jesus Christ. How much is it? 1.6 million. It makes me want to risk it all. Yeah, right. Just sign up for it. If I was Connor, I do one than Burger King commercials and buy one of these two different, were you?

Speaker 2:          02:05:19       I'd get when these fucking things. It's not my style. That's a little too little too little clicks on them. We'll take cars. Lipstick. Orange saw me do it.
