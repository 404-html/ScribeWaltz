Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Is looking to go to war. Everybody else was looking to kill them. Everybody else is looking at take it. Most people in this world just want to get by. They want to be healthy. They want to have children and have those children be happy and want to get through the day. They want to get through the fucking day. There are led by people who are profiting off of the drama.

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       That's the real thing. This is why this podcast is so important and not to be melodramatic is to go back to the success of this podcast and the success of vice and all this stuff is that it's because all of the other shit out there is bullshit. This is the whole thing is what happens in mainstream media and the news cycle is crap and what's happening here and the reason why you have so many people listening to you and supporting you. And the reason why vice is growing so rapidly is because we're just regular dudes were regular guys just like, you know, we like, we like mma fighting me, like having a few drinks with you and yeah. And you go out there in the world and you say, hold on a second, where's the fucking rationality? Yeah, why did these fuckers have nuclear weapons?

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       Why the fuck is this happening? Why is the fucking world sinking? And we're not doing something about it. I don't understand. I'm not like, I'm not a Jesus on the cross. I'm not, I'm not trying to be that guy. I'm just going out in the world and going, holy fuck someone. I say it's the end of the world is because I went to cashmere, I went to the Indian side of cashmere. The Indians said if we have another Mumbai attack, we will attack Pakistan. Then I went to Pakistan. I was like, why are you still sending these? You're training the ISI in the military. Why are you still sending these guys in India? They've said that if you still, if you send them in again, they're going to attack you and they're like, yes, because we're going to win and you're like, nobody's going to fucking win.

Speaker 2:          00:01:50       You're going to new kitchen, you're all going to die. And the thing is, as I keep saying there, and it's the same thing in China, it's the same thing. Even the funny shit that we do is like, it's the absurdity of the modern condition that's the world has become insane and I'm saying where all the adults say, but where's the rationality? Where's just two regular guys? And by the way, we're just sitting here in a, in a, in a, in a, in with a beautiful oak table, having a few drinks and so many people are resonating with it. So we're just two dudes talking. Yeah, but the thing is there's so many people, you know, resonate, resonate, resonate. Why? Because everyone just coming out of the pond going. Hold on a second, hold on a second. What the fuck's going on? What? We're all rational people. We're all smart people. We all have the Internet. We use fucking. See, all this shit's going on, what the fuck's going on? And I think that the answers are terrifying because you know what? Nobody has an answer. Oh well it's just this, this, this, and this. It's not really going to happen because it's that and it's just this guy doing that. Brian Cowen for Fox News. But the thing is, is it's not true. Like the regional thing, the New York Times

Speaker 1:          00:02:58       says, D, refuted that. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       yeah, but it's not true. Like there is no rationality. The answer is more terrifying than the question is why aren't they fucking. Why do they have nukes? Because we gave them because we're crazy because we're crazy because we so rushed

Speaker 3:          00:03:12       now had money. They needed to nukes. We hadn't needed money. Boom. Chucka boom. Chucka boom.

Speaker 2:          00:03:17       Correct. You know what to stay scary real. The real scary story is Canada had this thing that can do reactor, the failsafe react to the most safe reactor on her fucking beautiful reactor. The titanic and reactors and Canada is like, oh, we're the largest donator of 48. I'm Canadian by the way, and we're the largest foreign foreign donate as a foreign aid and then we gave the reactors to Pakistan and we said, now whatever you do, don't do anything bad with it. And they said, oh, of course not. And you're sitting there going, what the fuck? What the fuck were you fucking thinking? Canada giving them fucking reactors. What the fuck were you thinking? That's so silly. The reactive thing is a real freak out to me and I talk about my act like I don't know if I'm allowed to swear. By the way, what are you talking about here? What's the matter? Oh, you want a cigarette?

Speaker 3:          00:04:10       Will say that shit. I didn't know. I didn't know what you were saying. I didn't know that was a bad thing that somebody would not want you to indulge. Let's be real here. I don't know. Come. Come on. Shane Smith. You know I love you like a brother telling me what's going on. Who doesn't want you to indulge? You got an issue, Mrs. Mrs Shane Smith is perhaps doesn't want hubby had cancer or bullets is cigarettes, is the last thing she should worry about. These dudes go to the Congo and his underwear. He shocked with the Congo. You should worry. Have you gone? Did you go to the Kinda? Yeah. Yeah. See, that's where I dropped it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:41       I've been to Goma and it's a right now. It's, it's, it's going fucking crazy. The only way I would go to the Congo, it was if someone absolutely showed me, we're going to find the apes. I could see one of those eight giant. We're, we're still working,

Speaker 3:          00:04:57       bro. It's something you don't have. That's not like a sasquatch.

Speaker 2:          00:05:01       Did I ever tell you about the David? Show him the dinosaurs.

Speaker 3:          00:05:05       Yes. I watched that episode. He went. They believe there's a Brontosaurus in the Congo. He lit. There's alligators. Yeah. Okay. We need to wrap our heads around the idea that alligator is fucking survive. You know, I'm reading this Chris Ryan book sex at dawn. Fascinating, fascinating book. And he talks about the name you Katon with the name came from. Is the one of the, uh, American or one of the Christopher Columbus settlers. You don't have to worry about where you grew up in comedy clubs and pool halls. Let that shit go. Don't worry about it. He, uh, he asked them what is the name of your land? And the guy said something like, well, you know, in, you know, whatever the Mayan tongue is. And so they said Yucatan. Okay. You could tie that was like as close to it. Turns out one reviewed

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       what the actual original word was because I guess they wrote it down somewhere. It means in mine. I don't understand you. So when people go down to Cancun and they go get their freak on from spring break, they're there in the, I don't understand you peninsula for Ryan. That's when they went to India. Then said what? Where are we in there? Like Mumbai. Bombay. Perfect, perfect. Love it. Where are you? Beijing. Peking. Love it. Well, like Greece, they don't call themselves grease, right? Don't they have another name? Yeah, Hollis. There's a couple different countries like that. Japan is Nepal. That's another place where we just shot grease whole

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       Lee. Fuck yeah. Greece is completely insolvent. Is that the case? Well it is. And, and you know, so we just shot the riots in Greece, France, Spain, Italy, and actually the rise of the neo Nazis in Germany.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       Oh Jesus. But they're back. They're back. Don't call it a comeback. There's chicken fucking Nazis again in Germany. Really? Germans. Really? Folks, come on, you got the Internet, you've got four g and mother fuckers actually. What's, what? Faster Internet than us. Do they bribe the nos? Yeah, no, no. This year. Oh, we online at all a wipe. I found out that you probably have dsl and which is like the worst internet in the world. Right? And uh, so I put it down to like mobile bandwidth style. So like it's such a low a right myself. But is it working? Barely. You're a technological genius. Well, he's a bad motherfucker and without him I'd be lost. And he has, he has, he has a great tee shirts and I won't want to. Is a great taste in women. It's bad motherfucker that Brian Redman. Um, yeah. So do you mean look man, I love you, but every time we get together we start talking to them and gloom. I fucking Shit my pants and I want to believe that there is a way out of this. I want to believe I know is human. There is, and I've got to say this,

Speaker 2:          00:08:00       I've got to say this because it's up to guys like you guys like me and guys like everyone listening to this podcast

Speaker 1:          00:08:08       to say we have the power to. That's a lot of responsibility. We have to get high and watch the hobbit. However you want to get high.

Speaker 2:          00:08:17       The hobbit. However, I'm going to say this publicly and online. I'm Joe Rogan, who's a famous dude who does UFC and TV shows and comics, comic genius and all the stuff. He does a podcast, you know, pays for a fucking studio, pays for oak tables, pays for state of the art equipment and all this stuff to do a podcast to tell the fucking truth. And by the way, that's fucking admirable. And by the way, everybody out there who has a camera who has an iphone who has a fucking youtube connection, everyone can do it and everyone should do it because it's time to start fucking changing shit because you know what shit is fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:08:54       They are doing. And that's the beautiful. That's beautiful. There's a bunch of people that we've introduced via this podcast, like Danieli Bolelli and the guys from London real who came down to cast and they, they, those guys are really popular now though. Their podcasts are popular and it's, it's instead of you going through this traditional system of not being about the value of your contribution, but rather being about like who's hot and who's not, who's it and who's fucking date and who and all the nonsense that we get roped up in as primates, as social primates, and to instead say the fuck them.

Speaker 2:          00:09:31       But I would like to say to everyone who's listening to this Joe Rogan Red van over there, just fucking the technological genius. You guys are doing something that is purely democratic, that is incredibly fucking important, incredibly useful. It's the reason why every time I come to La to do this, because you guys are giving guys like me and everybody else a fucking platform to say, hey, by the way, I don't want to be all doom and gloom what I want to say, but hold on. What I want to do is say this shit is happening. It's real and people should know about it and we can do shit about it, and by the way, it's not just us. Here in America. People in India can do shit about it. People in Pakistan can do shit about it and by the way, youth are fucking pissed off. They're upset. The politicians have failed them. The rich are getting richer, the poor getting poorer and what we're trying to do is bring back journalism in the sense that journalism is saying this shit is fucked up and we collectively have to solve it. Otherwise you have kids. I have kids, our kids are gonna be fucked.

Speaker 3:          00:10:30       Yeah. I run through these various scenarios in my head about the future of humanity and the only thing that gives me hope is the access to ideas and information that are available today. Just for me, what I know about me with a phone, I can pretty much answer almost any question I have about anything in the world and within a couple of hours of sitting there and reading shit, all you need is a goddamn.

Speaker 2:          00:11:00       You're a guy that doesn't have to do this. You don't have to take your time out. You don't have to pay all this money to set this up. How much money? Well, okay. It's fairly reasonable and it's hard and it's money and it's time of your day and you're setting up this shit by the way. More people should be doing it and more people should be doing shit because

Speaker 3:          00:11:17       thinking about it that way. I mean, the way I think about it is, first of all, we were doing it at my house and then we were doing it. Brian's place that he set up, that's quite studios in the ice house. And uh, I found out about it, I was like, why am I doing my shit in my house? Like, let's, let's take this to the next level. It's. So I was inspired by like Brian Putting together this crazy studio that's using it for, you know, how long have been there, Brian?

Speaker 2:          00:11:41       Yeah, it was a year anniversary month.

Speaker 3:          00:11:44       Bob Fisher. You beautiful motherfucker. You the guy who owns that place is just such a sweetie. They're all sweeties. They're the wages are sweeties, but everybody's nice. But look at what you built

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       out of it. Now I've got to say everybody out there should take this as an example because everybody can do shit. Yeah. And by the way, you're doing shit. You don't have to do shit. You're doing shit. See, that's where it gets. That's where I want to sort of straightened. I don't think that I. it's not like I don't have to. There's no, there's no motivation to do this other than joy other than fun other than the fact that I have. I love talking to guys like you. Like how, how else would I organize a three hour conversation with you? And I, the only way to make it enticing is I have to fucking broadcast online to get to meet someone like you. Like tomorrow we're doing that. Uh, John McAfee, the guy, the virus guy who is, you know, in believes on the run. We're doing that guy. I couldn't get to talk to that guy in real life. Why would he talk to me? But you tell more truth here, right?

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       Your podcasts, then Msnbc and Fox put together. And I've got to say that's the future of journalism, that it's, it's, it's, it's people, regular people like you and me who actually give a shit and who have actually learned stuff. And because you go around the world

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       and UC Shit, I go around the world and should we see this stuff? And we go, hey, this is ridiculous. Yeah, change is incredibly difficult, incredibly difficult for people to change. It's incredibly difficult for systems of government or systems monitoring systems to change. Change is incredibly hard and resisted tooth and claw and the people that are involved in Msnbc and CNN and all these people that perpetrate all this nonsense journals and I don't fault them, I don't because as a guy who's been, well, this is my position as a guy who's been in the system of television before. I've been on two different TV shows that was on a sitcom for five years, and then I was on fear factor for six years. I kind of see. I've got a pretty good view of the whole system of creating things in the network. It's insurmountable. It either has to collapse or be absorbed by the Internet. Those are the only options, but it as it stands, is bureaucratic. There's too many people involved, too much decision making. It's not, it's too different. It's too expensive and difficult to put together a fucking Sitcom. If

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       you look at your audience and you look at what you're doing and, and other people like you are doing, you have millions and millions of followers. And I would say this, I would say, look, you have as many. And by the way, more, um, you have an audience that's actually willing to do shit and willing to participate and then they, you know, they tweet and the, and the facebook and then get on the socials. And I would say this is like, if you look at Fox, which is an aging at 67, 68, those people are dying and you're going to die out. This is the future. And what you're doing is you're saying, I'm going to put my flag in the sand and I'm going to say, you know what? I'm going to have you been in TV. You've been successful. You're still on TV, you're still successful. You're killing it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       And, but yet still, you'll take your time out of your day to come here and say, we're going to try. We're going to do some funny stuff. We're gonna do some regular stuff. We're gonna do this and that. But we're going to try to fucking at least say, hey, this is what's going on with mcafee. This is what's going on in Pakistan. This is going on. Whenever you have me on, you have other people on. And I got to say, look, that is the future of journalism because that is the only way today that we're going to get to the truth.

Speaker 1:          00:15:15       And I, look, I, I agree with everything you just said. And the reason why do it is because people like you are out there. The reason why I'm so committed to doing a podcast like this and the reason why Brian and are committed to keeping them free is we, we, we benefit from it just as much as everyone else does. We benefit from it from our own conversations. I mean, Brian and I were just talking about simulation theory today, you know, it's, and it's because it's brought up by so many brilliant people in the podcast that, you know, we, we've had these like freaky discussions about it. It's a, this podcast has been an incredible fucking thing. Like I can't ever take. Not only can I, I don't feel like I can take any responsibility for it. I can't take any accolades for it because all it is, is, is, it's, it's really, um, just, uh, I feel like completely like a conduit.

Speaker 1:          00:16:08       And I feel like if I can tune into guys like you or had less trout on last year, last week, survivor man, you know, and I've had Alex Grey, the brilliant visionary artists. If I can get a forum where these people can talk through the Internet and reach all these other people like I who else has that opportunity. And also you had it, you would do it if anybody else had that. They would do it. If you're thinking in your right mind and you had a million people that were paying attention or whatever the fuck it is now and you knew some shit, you'd want to tell people some shit.

Speaker 2:          00:16:42       But I'm allowed to say it's admirable. And listen, that's not nearly as admirable. We're chilling here in the fucking valley. Brian and I are in the air condition studio. You're out there and Mumbai to out there and I'd like to say is life is good, right? In our life has been good and we got to kind of get out of jail free card. When I got out of college, I used to say I'm never going to live in a house as nice as my parents or, or drive a car is nice to my parents and gen x generation sort of got to get out of jail free card, but Gen y is going to have to pay the bill and you know, and, and, and, and so saying, I think it's our responsibility to say we know the fucking problems. We know what's going on. We know that this is a fucking problem and we have to go out there and say, look, this is a problem. I don't know the solutions. Again, I'm not Jesus on the cross, but at least people. And this is why. This is what gives me hope is that people fundamentally I believe are good. And I also believe people are fundamentally smart and people fundamentally want to do the right thing.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       Well, I think people fundamentally want to be good because love fields better than hate. Like if I have a little tiny dispute

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       in my life, I don't know about you, but the way I feel about, especially if like amongst my circle of friends or amongst people I do business with or work with, if there's any sort of a tiny dispute, there's a ripple in my force and I don't like it. I don't like that feeling and I want to resolve it is lovingly and as kindly and as apologetically as I can. I always feel like that and some people never get to a position where they really feel at peace with their place in the world and how they interact with other people. They can't. Whether it's because they're too in debt or they're in a fucking terrible neighborhood or they grew up with a crazy mother. Whatever it is. You took a bad career path, stuck in a fucking abusive job position. Whatever the fuck it is that locks you into your reality, your existence. It's very difficult for people that are in a torturous position to look at possibilities and options and to look at the possibility and options that this might not be the correct way to live life and that in reality, my narrow minded view has sent me on this insurmountable path of ultimate failure and there's no way to accumulate enough shit in this life if you're a temporary being, there is no way. So if that is a focus of your existence to accumulate,

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       that doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy some shit. Doesn't mean you shouldn't like get a fucking Samsung Galaxy s three and go Ooh, because all that shit's bad ass too.

Speaker 3:          00:19:12       The, the, the, the reality of like something like when you, when you hear people talk about, I was having a conversation with someone and they started talking about the law of attraction. Oh, it's the law of attraction. You bring it into your life. It's the law of attraction, like

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       maybe, but maybe babies die and drive bys too. Like what's real? What's realistic is let's look at this whole thing, the reality that we exist in. Let's look at this whole thing. It'd be honest about it and say we woke up in the middle of a dream, the, the, the American, the whoever the fuck you are with the Japanese man who 50 years old who wakes up and his alarm clock goes off today and looked at this world. This world woke up in motion, and the people, there's too many of them. First of all, there's too many of them to ever communicate that no one can. No one understands what I fucking anybody saying. There's too many different languages. There's no universal acknowledgement of our plight and we are headed to doom. Ultimately. There's no way if we continue along a certain path that it doesn't completely exploded in our face, whether it's overpopulation or whether it's pollution or nuclear disaster. There's a certain amount of stops along the way until the whole thing ends. Well, I think I agree with you and I think that our generation, yours and mine has come out of the pond and we've had a good life and I love. I love this country because I came down here and build your country better. I know I do. My Shit hits the fan. I'm moving to Canada for fucking sure. I don't even care if it's Montreal. I'll deal with that snow. I'll take it. Toronto. I'll get a snowblower in the warm coat,

Speaker 2:          00:20:50       but the thing is is you sit there and you say, we came out of the pond. We realized that shit is happening. Yes, we want to live a good life. I want shit to get better. Precisely because I've had such a good life and I'm not a doom and gloom guy. I'm a party guy liked to drink. I like to travel. I like to eat. I like to do stuff. I like to learn or to go to all these different places. The reason why I'm like, Hey, hold on. These guys want to nuke each other or hold on the world to sinking or hey, hold on. This shit's happening. This is going to fuck everybody up is because I like my life is because I like guys like us because I like where we've gotten to date. The problem with it is is that you sit there and you say, okay, I don't want the next generation to not have that, to not be able to go outside, swimming the river, go fishing and do all that stuff and and bright.

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       Now we're at, we're at literally just sort of breaking point. We're at that inflection point of, of we are, we can fix it, we can solve it. We're smart, we're good. People want to do it, and if you follow this, I'm sure you do. The people who follow you and, and, and, and if you look at what they say on twitter and you look at what they say on facebook, people are fucking angry and they're down and they're happy. He want to do something. They're not ready. They're not represented. And the thing is, is what's happening, especially globally, let alone in this country, but what's happening globally is that the people with the power or disenfranchised because the systems that are in place are set up as such, that they can't be represented. So what this is, is this is true grassroots democracy. And by the way, I hope to God it continues and gets bigger and bigger, and I was making a joke earlier, this is the first podcast from here, and I'm like, I'm going to look back 20 years from now and say this was the first podcast that changed the world because this is the root of journalism, which is the root of democracy.

Speaker 1:          00:22:49       Well, I think that the people that are in the position of power that are doing these horrible things, we really need to figure out how to heal those motherfuckers.

Speaker 2:          00:23:01       I think we have to figure out how to get them the fuck out.

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       You got to get them the fuck out, but you also get them the fuck out. We got to discourage that type of behavior in the future. I mean, if you want to be a real hippie and a total idealist, you would say that there's gotta be a way that almost everybody can change and that these people that are in this position, these positions of power that are looking at things like war and economic attacks on countries embargoes or all these different various things that people do that really can cause unbelievable irreparable harm to communities and families and like, wow, we need to figure out a way to get those people to look at things differently and say, your motivation is off. Your motivation is based on many shitty primate shit. It's based on some ancient primate shit while you were running away from Jaguars and you had to be the most vicious motherfucker to survive and that stuff manifests itself today. Millions of years later in the male dominance mentality and that mentality is not best suited for attacks against your fellow man and it can be conquered. It can be conquered. It can be understood. It can be understood in your mindset. You will be happier person if you do not behave in that manner and you won't be any happier if you get more money. There's a certain amount of money where it doesn't matter.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       Well, I have. I've got to say also that if you look at it and say I want real people. I want people like me who have had a drink too many, who've done a few drugs who've done that, who've had a real life. If you have, you know, guys like, you know Romney who's like squeaky clean and whatever. I'm like, I don't want a robot representing me. Yes, because I'm not a robot. I'm flawed and fucked up and I've been through crazy. Well see, but the whole thing is, is I want someone who's human. Well, he's, I want someone who's been through shit and who spoke fucking dope when he was fucking nine years old and someone who's emerged. I want someone who knows what the fuck is going on.

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       Romney could be saved with mushrooms, mushrooms, and tie hookers and just get Romney on a fucking island and just give him some mushrooms and let them understand that this is, this is a fucking dream, man. This is one frame and an infinite movie that goes on forever and the only control that you have whatsoever is to enjoy it, to increase harmony,

Speaker 2:          00:25:24       to spread the love to use as you were talking about, you know, talking to she emails or talking to Taliban or talking to this or that. The thing is is if you just talk to these motherfuckers, everybody has a point. Everyone has a point of view. Everyone has appointed and if you actually say, look, you know, by the way, for example, when I was in Pakistan, they were like, we are Super Mad that you let the innocence of Muslims come out like America, you know, sponsored that, whatever. And you're like that video you're talking about and you said you understand that there's millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day, every fucking day on Youtube. There's no government regulation. There's no, you know, Obama's not sitting there going, ha ha, we really got them now and they could not believe that they were just like, no, you guys have done this thing and that's why we're shooting.

Speaker 2:          00:26:21       There were people killed and there's been no violence because of this. And now there's a whole, uh, you know, because a lot of the people that are literate that your mom say, well, America is doing this and this is part of their policy whenever, and you're like, this was just a bunch of fruitcakes who did the fucking thing and all of a sudden now people are dying and there's, you know, home militias being mobilized because of this and that point. You're like, if people just actually fucking, which I do, I say, look, I'm going to tell you I lived there. I do this. I have two of the most popular channels on Youtube. People just upload shit. It just fucking happens. It's not like government policy. It's not propaganda. It's not this, it's not that they don't fucking get it. And if you just actually just said, look dude, here's the way it is. Here's the reality of the situation, which no buddy does. That's the whole fucked up thing is nobody sits there and says, this is actually what happens. This is the truth.

Speaker 3:          00:27:16       Well, you're not saying you're incorrect. It's not, it's you, you do it. Your motherfucker. Y'All fucking channel does it. What are you talking about? It's, there's guys like you, there's this, there's the congressmen that are coming up like Daniel Seaman, the congressional representative, or a candidate rather who is completely honest and well read. And the young, there's a, there's a whole group of people that are coming up now. There's a bunch of people that are broadcasting, whether it's the young Turks or whether it's, uh, you know, any, a number, you know, and Alex Jones to a large extent, a lot of what Alex Jones says, although absolutely ridiculed in the 19 nineties, shows to be true in 2012. I've been Alex's friend for a long fucking time and a lot of people think he's crazy and he's fucking crazy. That's why they think he's crazy. But he's crazy in a beautiful way.

Speaker 3:          00:28:04       And he's right a lot of the time. And that's sort of, that's sort of understood now and there's enough information now that people have their head collectively cocked sideways. I think the whole United States is like, wait a minute, there's something I tweeted yesterday that someone tweeted me and I've read tweeted it was 33 different conspiracy theories that turned out to be correct. And when you go and look at them and you go, oh, okay, this is just. This is sort of how it's always been. So what we have to do is figuring out how to get these people that are thinking this way and this crazy position of power where they, whatever group, however many agree to do something totally a moral and for profit. I guess that's really the only real reason. Whenever it comes down to it, we have to figure out how to reach people like that and to let them know that this is a false pattern. Your mind is locked in some nonsensical thinking that is based on the predatory instincts of animals that had to survive from fucking cougars and Jaguars and bears and shit. There was a ruthlessness that's designed into the DNA to make sure that the animal procreates and that can be overcome and that we have to understand that the only, the only way to true happiness is to look at each other collectively as if it's us living another life and you look at every person you meet because if it's you living with,

Speaker 2:          00:29:31       but also just to, to, to, to. I agree with you 100 percent because it sounds like hippie. No, no, but, but, but you look at you and you say, look, here's a guy, you know, ufc came up, taekwondo, Chevy's, you're fighting guy. You know all this stuff. Obviously we're two guys here sitting here. We're not hippies. But what we're coming to is, is saying, look, we came up, we came up hard, we fought, we did all this stuff and now we're realizing this shit. And we're saying, hey, you know, we've seen this. We've learned from. This is why to go back to it is I don't want politicians representing me who don't understand this. Yeah. Which is I came up hard. I came up from the streets. I learned this shit, I learned that the hard way by going to these places and what I've realized is exactly what you said, which is unless we've overcome our base desire, which is I hate you, I'm going to fucking bomb you. We're all dead. We're all dead because now it's not a knife. It's not a gun. It's not an RPG. It's not a tank. It's a new kid or fucking warhead. And when we start fucking trying to fucking be alpha male with a nuclear warhead like Achy Yukon, then we're fucking. Where's that guy is? He's still alive. He's still alive. He's still alive. He's in Pakistan Christ. And he's the reason why there's the proliferation of nuclear fucking.

Speaker 1:          00:30:56       Does he have technology? 20 bitches around him just dancing in their underwear at all times. Do you think so, but no. Be a fucking man with it. At least if you've got to be at concord, be a fucking old school cafe.

Speaker 2:          00:31:09       He has a bunch of Isi guys around him at all times because those guys, those guys. So the ISI is the CIA of Pakistan and they started the Taliban and they are the guys who are basically running Pakistan and they are the guys who were becoming increasingly radicalized and they're the guys who were saying, we are going to bomb India, needed to get those people on mushrooms. What we need to do is just say, you're not allowed. You're not allowed to blow up the world. You cannot do it. And by the way, if we had politicians who were doing the right thing, you would go to India, go to Pakistan and say you're not allowed. Which means that we have to say Russia is not allowed. We're not allowed. Nobody's allowed. Because again, to go back to it, if you're playing roulette and double zero means the end of the fucking world, you shouldn't be playing fucking relax. And so take that double zero off the fucking

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       board police. If you're playing Russian roulette, you have five chances to not get shot in the head when you're playing world dominance. It's like how many opportunities you have to start a nuclear war. Exactly. It's really not a question, not a question of, of when, if it's a question of when. Yeah, there's not a whole lot of chambers. It's the whole thing is fucking ridiculous because it's people locked up in this idea that somehow or another conquering makes things better and then somehow under the controlling the resources makes things better. And this, this all these observations now from people that are, uh, paying attention to what's going on in Afghanistan about minerals, minerals, and how long they've known that Afghanistan is. It's an incredible deposit and mineral minerals from Congo.

Speaker 2:          00:32:55       Yeah. What's happening? What's happening now in the Congo is 100 percent due to Colton. They wouldn't be fighting. They wouldn't have all the money, they wouldn't have tram Colton, Colton. Colton is a, is a rarer thing wrong that makes all your iphone, your Samsung, your ipad. They all need Colton, uh, to actually work. And the majority of Colton actually is in Congo. And so what's happened now is this continual warfare, um, you know, and it's, I believe now the sixth bloodiest war in the history of humanity is all happening because of ipads, iphones, samsungs, all these things. We're buying them. This is the whole thing were disconnected. I mean, I grew up thinking, well, whatever happens in Africa, in Africa, and that's their problem, not my problem. Then you realize, oh, that fucking war is happening because I have an iphone five. I mean, that's the reality of the situation.

Speaker 1:          00:33:59       It's sort of analogous to the human experience. If you really, boy, that sounds gay, hippie and gay at the same time. So we're really having a love fest to pick up a confused dude

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       in the new, in the new

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       studio, the human. If you look at the human experience and you look at where we're at right now at the highest levels and let's perceive at the highest levels are innovation and technology. And that the fact that we can broadcast this with minimal cost, even though it's kind of sucking right now, powerful att and t the. Why'd you get DSL? I don't know, man. I had a fucking. Who did this manager handle this shit. Oh, does this business manager? Uh, I dunno. I never met him. Listen to it. You need a young kid do that shit. I got shit I need to deal with. This is not one of them. You've thrown me off. Where was I?

Speaker 2:          00:34:49       Minerals. Everything Metro's earlier.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       Whatever. What's the. Is it important that I finished my sentence? I have nothing to say. Ladies and gentlemen of grandstanding. Clearly I'm trying to somehow or another project project better ideas through whiskey. Three whiskey and marijuana allegedly allegedly don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. Folks. Sounded like Colin Quinn there.

Speaker 2:          00:35:15       You've got to irrigate. Yeah, irrigate the mine.

Speaker 1:          00:35:19       Yeah. That's important. People don't drink. I've never been drunk. I don't really like you. Nor do I trust you. Okay. I'm going to be honest. I trust drunks. I even trust dry drunks. I trust her. Just saying that because I'm here. Nope. No, I'm just being honest. I, I, uh, I appreciate sober people. Don't get me wrong, but if you have not a least experienced whiskey with all the people raving about it, would you not dive in the water so at least once? How stubborn are you? You've never had a drop of alcohol. Who are you partying with? Man, that's ridiculous. If your friends have kept you from a drop of alcohol, they're assholes.

Speaker 2:          00:35:52       It's usually people that have had too many drops of alcohol. It seems like everyone I know is in a hour.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       Well, you know what? The issue is slightly biological and that's something that I'm willing to admit 100 percent because I have friends that I trust dearly, like Fitzsimmons. Greg Fitzsimmons is greg and I have been friends since we were in our early twenties. I think we met when I was 21 and Greg was probably the same age greg has always had. He's. He's a legit alcoholic and it's in the sense of he could have a drink today and he could be fine, but there will be a pole, a biological pool that's reinforced by his relatives. It's reinforced by generations and I have many friends that have this issue and I do not discount it. My friend Tate Fletcher, he's a brilliant guy and tate has a problem with substances. He cannot, you know, he's like, I go, could you even like take a look, a baby hit of a joint?

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       He goes, maybe or I could wake up in an alleyway naked and not know what the fuck happened and I'm not willing to make that jump. I'm not willing to take that chance. There's biological weirdness. People fucking get. They die from peanuts. Okay. A person can be allergic to peanuts and die. I would never discount that, but I think that generally speaking, there's a mentality of non chance taking boring bullshit that comes with the. I've never had a drink. People. There's a few examples that are contrary, like Penn Jillette has never had a drop of alcohol and the only time he's ever had any sort of medication. There's been injured after surgery, like a, some sort of a painkiller, but he's a brilliant guy and I love talking to him. He's one of the rare examples. Most people that have never even been fucked up, you never. You never tried to get laid when it was preposterous. You've never tried to pick up a girl with. There's no way medically you can get an erection if you've never been 21 years old and thrown up in the backseat of a cab. Who are you? Who are you and who do you party with?

Speaker 2:          00:37:51       But I also think that it's, again, to go back to the people we're talking to is it's a way to sort of distance yourself from all the norms and to say, I'm going to question what the fuck's going on. I think and maybe some conspiracy theories are not true and maybe some aren't true, but at least we have to question them. Oh, for sure. There's a lot that aren't true, but for sure there's not, but we have to question them. Yes. And that's the whole thing. We have to question shit. That's our. That's what we are as humans. We have to fucking shit. And we also have to say, how do we get better?

Speaker 1:          00:38:27       It's a funny thing to say, but I'm not endorsing alcohol consumption, but there's a certain humility that comes from being an drunk.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       Will you step back and kind of, you know, you just realize like, look, this is all fun. You know, like Tony Bourdain, you know Anthony Bourdain, I've had the pleasure of having on the podcast. He said, Guy, just like you, a regular dude, you talk to them, but there's a certain like having a drink with you, having a drink with him, having a drink with anyone who's just a real guy. Anyone who's where, where there's a moment that comes when you've had a couple of drinks. When you look at each other. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:39:08       we're fucked up. Who knows? It's crazy, but he's a perfect example of a dude. Yeah. I had a cooking show on the travel channel. Well before that, he's a chef. He was a chef. Wrote a book, but the book, it's told truth, but what the hell happens in restaurants. Exactly. But he had it. He had a cooking show on the travel channel, nothing in nothing, and he turned it into a political statement and he turned it into trying to tell the truth and he turned it into we're going to eat some food, but what the fuck is really going on with real people? Yes, and I think again, there's a lot. There's a whole movement. There's you, there's him, there's me, there's, but there's like $100, million. There's millions of this now because of technology and I think that you know him and I believe he built the travel channel on his.

Speaker 2:          00:40:00       What about Bert Kreischer? How do you feel about Bert? Bert? Bert Dot com. Just to finish with, with Anthony Bourdain. I would say that that guy, that guy went out into the world and, and talked about shit that you should talk about on a channel that would never talk about that shit otherwise. And a channel by the way. That's very conservative on by script. Yeah. Which is the server scripts. Scripts. Yeah. So travel channels on prescriptions, pps. It's a very Christian fundamentalist and he takes a lot of heat and he gets a lot of shit and they tell them not to do stuff and he says, fuck you, I'm going to do it anyway because he wants to fucking tell the truth and I got to give it up to him. He has a lot of fun

Speaker 3:          00:40:46       in their defense and their defense. I do understand that the travel channel has started to try to reevaluate their position and maybe reach out because I heard they're interested in Arusha fear because some of their executive saw him kill at the dcm product and so they just.

Speaker 2:          00:41:02       But bordain ordain me like, look, he opened the door. Oh No. DRIPS is super, super conservative. Super Christian. Their poster child is a dude who goes out in the world and says, you will eat some food. We'll cook some shit, but I'm going to tell you the fucking truth about what's going on. What he did. He. He said, I'm going to show you some cool shit. I'm going to show you some cool music. I'm going to show you should cool bands and I'm going to talk about and people are going to talk about what's really going on

Speaker 3:          00:41:26       and people are going to go, by the way, watch the travel channel. Okay. I Bert Kreischer, I love him to death. I would totally watch any show that

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       he's on, but I never watch the travel channel before. Anthony Bourdain was never. I never even thought about watching it. I don't know how I even tuned into his show. I suspected I was just channel surfing. Yeah, I was just flipping through channels and all the sudden there's this guy's talking about Vietnam and how much he loves Vietnam. And I remember going, who is this crazy fuck my barrier and camels and he's loving it. And, but most importantly, he approaches the whole thing with this, this really palpable feeling of humility and honesty and you know, pie drunkenness on occasion and it's, uh, it's, it's not just admirable. It's enticing, it's attractive. It pulls me, you know, it's like your shows all of your shows, man. I found out about vice because of the, uh, the Heinemann x a episode. The guy who lives in the Arctic, where does he live in northeast Alaska or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:42:29       He lives in the most remote part of the, of the world. He's the, he lives. He's the most remote human being in the world. There's um, uh, I have a message board on my website and the message board is before twitter, it's been around since like 1998. My, my friend Andrew started the message board and it's been this incredible like magnet for fucking Weirdos and a lot of cool people. But what's, what's been really fascinating that twitter is sort of surpassed it in a way just because of the sheer access. But what my message board became was just this strange area where cool shit would be drawn to. So they would post these things, these threads about shit you would never find out on your own. Just the average person is not connected to community. You're never gonna find it. What do you, why would you even look at [inaudible] Dot com?

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       Why would you, what would you be googling that would connect you to a series? Someone put up this, uh, this link to this video and I watched this guy that's got frozen caribou hanging from a fucking tree and he saw them and cooking them and your guys that were there, which is blown away by the experience of hanging out with this dude lives in a 100 foot square shack in the fucking most hostile environment, known demand and to see that he was not only was he not a loon but that he was, there was no narration. The narration was just sort of describing how they got there and what was going on, but it was never. It was never any judgment on people or the scenario and w w what I found really fascinating about it, I was like, you got to know a guy with all the. And Hind mole has lived here for 65 years. He used content wondering the frozen countryside, hoping to spot a Caribou. Is He happy? Only high mode truly knows you didn't do that. You, you, you instead inserted intelligent people into a alternative sort of a situation. This sounds like a Bologna.

Speaker 2:          00:44:39       No Bro. Fucking watch this one live is, it's because we practice it. A type of journalism called immersion isn't where we go. We immerse ourselves in the actual story and we just pressed record. You guys changed this podcast? No,

Speaker 1:          00:44:58       I want you to know that for sure. One hundred percent that, that episode and the subsequent episodes that I watched all the devil you guys changed because I was like, this guy is a fucking. You're in, you're there, you're actually there. You know you're really going to write. When I was making fun of kissing someone's Dick,

Speaker 2:          00:45:19       but I will say talking about twitter is after I do this podcast, you get so much response from people who give a shit and people who are saying this shit like the truth and it blew my mind and this and that, and you realize like, you know, we're guys just, you know, talking about shit and whatever and they're going, this is. I learned more on that podcast and Fox and MSNBC and CNN and everybody all put together and that's the tragedy. It's, it's great. For us, it's the tragedy because we're just regular dudes going, okay, this is what the fuck is happening. Don't think it's a tragedy,

Speaker 1:          00:45:58       man. I think it's the the, the normal chain of progression and I think it's a natural. It's a natural system and I think that you don't get to be you unless you've seen burt reynolds get a crazy facelift, right? You don't get to be you until you've seen all the most preposterous shit that people have done. You don't get to be you until you read all the crazy accounts of nonsensical violence on the Internet, either the crazy revolutions in Arab spring and all over the world and all the things you physically experienced by actually being in these places where there are chaotic events that are just uncontrollable by the population

Speaker 2:          00:46:42       out of, but it doesn't mean anything unless people watch. It doesn't mean anything unless there's an audience. It doesn't.

Speaker 1:          00:46:48       The you're compelled like you, you, you, you can't even take credit for what you're doing because you're compelled. You're compelled by the natural order of the universe. The natural order of the universe is to move in and in a progressive direction and the more understanding and more comprehensive and lightened direction. That's all of our ideas. The idea is not to maintain the science of the 17 hundreds. The idea is to figure out how to, you know, how to get on Mars and create an atmosphere so we can have a new plan in case someone gets hit by an asteroid. The ideas that are consistently move forward and I think we're just caught in the struggle of that happening and my real hope for, for the world. Like I, I, you know, all that shit about a gi. The people that believe that you can manifest reality.

Speaker 1:          00:47:37       They know the secret and the idea that you know your own mind and the more you focus on things, maybe maybe, maybe it's just the fact that you're not paying attention to what you could do positively. And that's what impacts the world. And positively. What we've got to figure out how to do is to change the mindset of all the people and the people that are in positions of power instead of fighting them and attacking them and try to understand the fact that the human animal is incorrect, doubly frustrated. We don't know what's going on. We have these fucking bodies that are exactly the same as pre internet pre movies, Prix cars and planes and it's all happened so quickly all around us that we haven't had the chance to really as as a, as a super organism, taken all of the knowledge and distribute it in a way that w, w, w where we we govern over the consciousness of the population in a fair and ethical way. That keeps everybody happy, but I think ultimately that that is a possible scenario for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       It has to be. Has to be. If we don't believe that, then we're really fucked. I don't think, because I was saying doom and gloom. I don't think this is doom and gloom. I think this is positive because as long as we know what the fuck is going on, we can work towards doing something about it. The problem is is we didn't know what the fuck was going on because nobody fucking told.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       That's a perfect way of describing it. That's a perfectly describing it. The real problem is that we were living in some crazy movie. We since the 19 fifties, we have been locked into some sort of crazy version of the world that is in many ways based on fiction and the real issue is whether the war of the worlds, even when the war of the worlds. You've got to Piss.

Speaker 2:          00:49:32       No, you got to go. No, no. What are you doing in your head? I'm going to go and get a drink of it. I didn't want you to say that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:38       The war of the worlds freaked fucking people out. If you don't know what it is, Orson Welles in like, who knows when the fuck it was. Alex wants to get out of here, but it's not happening. Bitch. Take a seat. Don't worry about your previous commitments. They're not as interesting. The war, the war of the worlds was the first time where human beings were able to be tricked into thinking by Orson Welles that there was an attack by alien beings like people freaked out and it's really difficult to discern how much of it as bullshit, how I, how much of it actually happened because they say there were suicides. Who knows what the actual statistics, where you know, we're talking about the 19 thirties or whatever the fuck it was, but the reality which is that human beings were not prepared for

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       the information that was coming at them. They were in prepared. That wasn't an, that wasn't a regular part of their life where they had grown accustomed to having this fakery planted on them. It's not like today with the onion, you know, like every now and then I'll retweet an article and it turns out to be like some new fake onion, like some, a bunch of dudes who like think that the onion is cool. So they create their own bullshit news story. Those motherfuckers and your retweet them. But that's to be expected that the, the, the, the people that existed before the internet or before, those are the people that sort of set this scenario. They set the momentum of our culture and they did not have access this shit. We have now. The idea that we're so hung up on the brilliant wisdom of some people that lived in the 17 hundreds and created the declaration of independence, which by the way, it was written on fucking hemp. The first drafts that the fact that we're committed to the ideology, these people that lived, they didn't have

Speaker 2:          00:51:31       car cars or 2000 years ago. That's when religion started. And ever since then, everything else is a cult. But 2000 years ago, that's when we knew what the fuck was going on. Well, I've got to juggle my act about Romney, that it's a cult when you know who wrote it, because we can. It's not like we have to go back to some fucking shit they found in Qumran that was written on animal skins. You know, this is like we know the guy, he was, his name is Joseph Smith and he was only 14. I mean this is not that confusing like you're a fucking cult man, but he found the book of Latter Day saints in his backyard. But you know, what's beautiful about the Mormon culture is that what I've learned from my personal experiences is that there are certain people in this life and although I don't

Speaker 3:          00:52:16       feel it's justified to lie to people, there's certain people who do get by better if they follow like at least a scaffolding of morality. Sure. Some sort of something that lets them believe that at the very top there's a Cherry and that cherries God and he's right up there on top of the whipped cream and you just got to get.

Speaker 2:          00:52:35       I think that's the problem is that if you look at this, we were talking about global warming earlier and you say, okay, yeah, Shit's fucked up. The world is thinking we're not going to believe in that because of God. And you're like, yeah, but you're going to die and your kids are going to die and it's going to be bad if we don't just say, this is the thing that is bad that's happening in a sense. No, because it's gotten whatever and they want. And I think it's this yearning to have. There's a rational being who has a plan for all of us. Well, the fact of the matter is is we are creating our reality and we are not a rational entity. Humanity isn't rational. Humanity is irrational and complex and fucked up and weird. But at some point somebody has got to come up and say, yeah, rational and where we given.

Speaker 2:          00:53:27       But there are certain things that we do which are self destructive. And by the way, they have to stop. For example, if you have the ability to destroy the fucking world, which is my world, you're destroying my world, right? And you're halfway across the world over there. If that's even a possibility that no is the answer, no, I'm not going to let that happen. So that's why I keep preaching on this stuff. Because when I went there and I said, Bill Clinton said it's the end of the world by the way. And I went, yeah. And so when he left the presidency, he said, that is the reason why cargo was more between India and Pakistan was the glimpse of the end of the world. And then he got his dick sucked by young and old. So

Speaker 3:          00:54:16       that's why it takes blows house of interns. So why not at least enjoy that sweet release, eat, drink, and be merry phase,

Speaker 2:          00:54:27       eat, drink, and be merry. The problem with that is, is when we went back, we realized, oh, it's fucking way worse than when he said it was the end of the world. So hold on, hold on. The whole thing is, is though, is we can stop it. We can say fuck it. Fuck it. We can't just, we just have to say there is, there can be no, uh, you know, intercontinental ballistic or nuclear warheads. There can be no, because what you're saying, just so everybody understands what you're saying then is as long as that technology is there, it will go to Iran. It will go to Pakistan, it will go to Congo, it will go to Libya, it will go because the technology is there. Right? And what happens when Kadafi now could fee is gone, but what happens when Kadafi has warheads? What happens when a que con has warheads?

Speaker 2:          00:55:19       What happens when, when Iran has words, when Israel attacks Iran, because it can have a nuclear around what's going to happen, what will happen when they attacked around? Everybody knows. Everybody knows what will happen when they attack rent and it's going to be a fucking catastrophe. However, it's nothing zero compared to what's happening in India, Pakistan, Israel and Palestine is like, you know like I guess when you're like 20, 21 and you have that one couple that just won't fucking break up and they keep fighting and they keep asking you for advice. What do you think I should tell her, bro? What do you think? There's tiller and I'm like, I think you should fucking run. I know there's people now.

Speaker 3:          00:56:08       Well yeah, there's a lot of them that use that as a distraction, right? Don't they don't. They aren't all conflicts ultimately some form of distraction because if, if the Israelis looked at the Palestinians that are suffering and these poor people that are trying to make

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       this sort of

Speaker 3:          00:56:27       home for themselves in this Gaza region is very dangerous and hostile region. What if they treated them all as Israelis? What if they treated them all as just fellow humans would if instead of lumping them into groups based on ideology and who believes what old crazy shit, what if they just looked at him as things that could be cousins that I mean that would instantly changed the whole thing. The idea that we need to exist in a conflict scenario. Is that the problem? That's the real issue. I don't agree with that. I have a neighbor, I don't even know this motherfucker and he wanted me to chop down my trees, but he's still nice. I say hi to him when I drive by. I had a convert. The only conversation I've ever had with this guy was a conflict, but I don't hate the dude.

Speaker 3:          00:57:09       You know? I want them to be happy. Just don't be crazy. Let me alone your mother fucker. I'll give you a hug. Come here, give me a what are you nuts, you know, come on, let's go have a drink. You know, that's what we should treat. The whole world can approach other human beings like that. It's just we have to get past this ingrained scenario that we have in our head, which is that war is a part of nature and nature is unsurmountable. It's, it is what it is. You got to accept, man, they're gonna want to be philanders and you know there's going to be conquest and swords and fucking rocket. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:57:42       but if you go, if you go to Mexico and you see what's happening there, now it's the rule of the thug. If you go to Pakistan as the rule of the thought, if you go to Congo, it's the fuck. Why? Because conflict breeds lowest common denominator. It breeds I have a gun and I'm willing to shoot it. Right? And whoever that, those aren't high thinking people. Those aren't people thinking we're going to save the world. Those aren't people thinking, you know, the world is thinking. Those aren't people thinking we could, you know, destroy the environment by, by having a new kid or standup. What they're thinking is, I'm going to gain power because I have a bunch of guys, you know, young guys, you generally young men with guns. If you look at what's happening in Europe right now, this is what's terrifying is you go to Spain and you say Spain, you know, old country educated country, you know, country.

Speaker 2:          00:58:34       Fifty percent of young people are unemployed, so you've taken away their future. We were just shooting. Their 6 million people came out and fucking shut the whole country. Then that's people who are pissed off, really pissed off. While you were filming there, what happened? Riots, what, what would they have? Well, there about us anti-austerity. So it's, it's young people saying we're fucked, but I mean there's riots in Paris and how sturdy means. What does that mean? So, you know, Spain is fucked economically, economically. What's happening there? This is what's really terrifying is that in, in, in so prolonged economic crisis. So the recession. Now, the last time this happened was the depression. Now what happened? Because of the depression was the rise of radical political solutions. I eat communism or fascism. So now what's happened is you have the rise of the Communist Party in, in, in, in Greece, and to counteract that, you have the golden dawn, which are full on fascists, who now are, are, are, you know, 14 percent of the government. Did you say the Golden Dawn? Golden Dawn are? Yeah. That's what I heard. The Golden Dawn. They have. They do this. Say the golden dawn will pretend because it's ridiculous. Whatever. Golden Dawn. Yeah. Okay. They do the. They do the Nazi salute. They had the swastika

Speaker 3:          00:59:48       saying, imagine if they had a big fucking thing. Other shirt was a big golden day. Frothy dogs. Would it be, would it be hard or would that be offensive for a military would have to be like,

Speaker 2:          00:59:59       well, they have the support of the military and the police and everywhere we went was anti immigration, anti EU, anti this. After that, and what's happening in Europe. This is what's terrifying is because you have an economic crisis, you have the rise of communist and fascist. So for example, in France you have a very far left government and the second party is from national fascist and you sit there and you say, okay, the exact same political situation exactly. That started World War Two is happening today in Europe, not fucking Africa, not Pakistan, not India, Europe, and it's happening in Germany. It's happening in Scandinavia, it's happening in Spain and happening in Italy. It's happening in Greece, it's happening in all these countries and you sit there and everyone just watching as exactly the same fucking thing that started World War II to the t, to the fucking teeth, riots in the streets, ultra right? Ultra left wing parties fighting each other, radical parties getting more and more power. And you're just saying, what the fuck do we have to do to. We have to relive it again. It's exactly the same thing that started world,

Speaker 3:          01:01:08       a natural cycle of humanity. I mean, if you look at societies, you can look at cultures and you look at this rise and fall. When you go to the Acropolis and you see the ancient Greek ruins and you wonder how the fuck why? Why are these regular houses like really close to this incredible structure? What happened is this, is this inevitable? Do are we in this constant state of developing consciousness and one of the big wrestling matches of trying to sort of innovate and accomplish higher levels of, of, of society and culture is that you, you have to meet some sort of opposition and if you don't meet opposition, you won't have the motivation to really accelerate things as fast as the technology around you is accelerating and completely get out of hand like it is right now. It is right now with with dictators and crazy fucks controlling nuclear weapons almost. It's almost like those things have to be in place in order to motivate the highest levels of thinking.

Speaker 2:          01:02:10       You know the, the, the, the cliche is those who don't understand history are doomed to repeat it. What's interesting is when you go talk to young people in Europe and you say, understand that this is exactly the same thing that happened at the start of world war two. They were like, don't you know, they don't know what you're talking about and they don't understand history. The other thing is they don't understand war and if you ever go look at war, and this is where I was talking about with the rack is war isn't the manly, you know, I got my shoulder nicked by a, by a bullet or you know, I come back with a purple heart or is a catheter bag. War is I don't walk again, war is I'm irradiated. War is I'm fucked up in the brain for the rest of my life.

Speaker 2:          01:02:52       And those who don't understand war are doomed to repeat it. And by the way, you know, hawks and people who say, let's go to war, let's go to war, go to war, go see a war zone. It's fucking tragic. It's tragic from start to fucking finish its babies with no fucking fathers. It's every man fucking killed. It's rape. It's, you know, in some cases in Africa cannibalism, it's, it's literally the lowest form of what we are as humanity and people who say, let's go to fucking war, let's go to war. Let's go to. You should fucking realize that before you go to war, young dudes, you know that we know are going to come back and their dick isn't going to work again. The fucking shit. Right. Again. All this stuff and you go, okay, that's what these people are proposing in Europe, in India, in Pakistan, in Africa, in Southeast Asia, in some cases in South America and in some cases here, that's what people are proposing. You're like, what the fuck? I would just like to take anyone who wants to say, let's go to war. I'd like to take them to a war zone because if you take people to a war zone, first you puke, then you cry and then you freaked the fuck up.

Speaker 1:          01:04:01       People, do you think in positions of power actually go to war zones? None. Wow. And the what are some must. I mean

Speaker 2:          01:04:09       you see photos you don't, but you don't see what it really does. So you don't see the reason why. The reason why I do what I do is because I've been to war zones and I've seen shit that makes your stomach turn and you'll never sleep right again, because when you see what war really fucking doesn't talk to marines and talked to rangers and talked to guys who come back from war, talk to them before they go and then talk to them when they come back. It's a completely different fucking conversation I have

Speaker 1:          01:04:40       and it's very similar to people that I know that had been to jail. There's A. I have a friend. We were friends when I was a teenager and he was always crazy and he just vanished. We didn't know what happened because I just knew him from the martial arts gym that I trained at, but he came back three years later with all these crazy scars all over his body. He had been a prison and he was a completely different human being. It was like before he was as lovable troublemaker and three years later the lovable troublemaker was gone. There was a psycho. There was a guy who had. He would fight for survival. He was a wild animal.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       You won't come back normal. You won't come back.

Speaker 1:          01:05:20       No, I know. I've met friends that have gone to war to. I've, I've, I've had quite a few friends that were in the military and went over and came back including a buddy of mine who went over as a mercenary. Yeah. You know, and it's a, it's a weird conversation when you're alone, you know, sitting down on the curb somewhere. Go on. So. So would you have to do. What was it like what would you, you know, how much they pay you? Do you want to do it again? You're done. I'm done. Are you sure? Like what the fuck? There's, there's realities in this world that I think most people in their day to day existence do not consider as a part of the equation. And those realities are real problem. The real problem for our culture because not only are they disgusting but they're unknown. They're avoidable there. Most of them are avoidable. We have a distorted perception of what can be done with the resources that we have in place. And I think that the sort of perception is based on greed.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       Yeah, when you see war and the aftermath of war, which is again to describe it, I'm not even going to do it justice, but it milky eyes from chemical weapons. People with their limbs hacked off a systematically, um, you know, women who have been raped, uh, you know, 50, 70, one, hundred times, you know, incredibly scarred people. And by the way, if you go over, especially if you go over from our culture, spend three years in that culture and look, it's chronicle after World War Two, after Vietnam, after Afghanistan, after Iraq, and you go to these things, you will never be normal again. You will never other mentally or physically you will never be normal again. So why do we still fucking rattle our sabers? Why do we still say we're gonna fight? Why do we still say we're going to fuck each other up? And the thing is, is if you look at it and you say, okay, why the fuck did we go to Iraq? Why the fuck were we there? All these fucking guys, all these marines, all these army guys who come back fucked up. Why did you come back? Why did you come back so fucked up and you're never going to be normal again. Why? Why was it al Qaeda? Was it nine slash 11? No.

Speaker 1:          01:07:30       Jesus Christ. Shane Smith. You motherfucking Downer. I was going to go home tonight and maybe watch a little boardwalk empire. Reminisce about how fucked up people were in the past. Have. That's your network
