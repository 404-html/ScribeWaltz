And the new one, uh, that the new cat is my favorite cat for sure. We've got to do something with that dude.

Speaker 2:          00:02:44       Oh wait. Do you see the newer, newer one that I'm working on right now? Um, I'm nervous because this was so fucking nervous. Do you think I'm nervous? It's hard to fucking do this now. I'm like, I got to make it better than the last one.

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       They're so weird. You know the, the strapped up with dynamite and fuck crazy looks at it. So it's like, what is the message here? Like what the fuck is the message here?

Speaker 2:          00:03:05       He has probably that we, I have a great park, has a Tom Green is Steevo at death squad ITV TV. Right now we just put as Kat von D and dead.

Speaker 1:          00:03:11       Oh, that's okay. This is the ones that you've been doing on Mondays. Yeah. Yeah. Lots of great podcasts at a desk. One on iTunes. We got Kevin Pereira if you've ever seen attack of the show. Kevin prayer was a host for the longest time and now he has one of the best podcasts on the Internet. Yeah, it's fucking awesome. The dude is just, he's so smart and he's so cool and he's just so in the right groove all the time. I love talking to that guy and I love his podcast and it's called pointless and you can catch that on iTunes and it's all always, all this shit is free. Always free. It will keep it free. Except my comedy special bitch. You got to pay for that. It's only five bucks though, you know, when Louis C K set out to do it. I think if you have to look at like, uh, the best comics in the country right now, I'd say Louis C K is like right at the very top of the heap.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       So when Louis C K puts a comedy special out, it's five bucks. You can't make your six, you know, you got to do five bucks too stupid, you know, or four. Well, how about you be a little humble. You're shit's worth about three 50, you know? But, um, the, uh, the ability to do that, uh, that Louie exposed was a huge, I mean, it was just an amazing new thing. Like a light went off in my head when I saw it, I was like, oh my God, that's how I'm doing everything from now on. It's just like, I wish I'd thought of it myself, but I'm so glad he did. And um, it's available DRM free on Joe rogan.net. It's only five bucks. You can get it, you can use paypal. And Amazon and uh, I paid for the whole thing. I paid to get it produced and filmed and edited.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       Any costs of gifted. Like I sent one to my dad. He just guided, I just got an IPAD and apple TV. So now he's all appling it out. So I send them a, I said it goes to his email. He just clicks on it and downloads it and then he could just, you know, streaming right. Two is a TV. That's great.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       I always had that uncomfortable moment when I have to talk to dude after he seen my act for the first time. Especially

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       the older guy. He's already seen you. Oh really? Maybe you saw you like seven years ago when we were there for the men of men of color.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       Oh, the, yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah, we did. That's right. Yeah. All right. We'll start this podcast ladies. Gentlemen. Andrew dice clay is here. Bitches respect, experience.

Speaker 3:          00:05:23       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       New Year's Eve. You dirty fucks. It's going down and drew mother fucking dice clay where it will be. How the, how can I say it? Showtime. Showtime, 10:00 PM on showtime. On showtime. Is this something you've worked, you've already filmed, it's not going to be, no, I've shown this already. You said you were very happy with it, really happy with it. But you know, I really stayed on it from beginning 10. I had a concept, you know, that I wanted to do as far as I'm concerned the most like an ultimate

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       rock and roll standup show to really bring excitement, you know, because like, you know, you know, you're very animated on stage, you know, you're all over the place, you move, you know, you could see that life and you, you know, and that's like the one thing that always bothered me about Comedians, that they don't know too much about performance art. Especially, you know, when the cameras are rolling, everybody thinks that great and then the cameras turn on and they stand like a fucking mummy, you know? So I really wanted to give a real edgy rock and roll's special. And you know, as you've met before, my son's, you know, La Rocs opens the show. Um, Eleanor Kerrigan, you know, who opens my, my shows is in the special, which you never even see an opening act in a one hour special. And it's just from the second it starts to the second it ends.

Speaker 4:          00:06:53       It's just exciting and it's fucking funny, you know? And that's, that's what I wanted to deliver. I wanted to give people something that, you know, especially, you know, the way the world is today, the whole political correctness fucking shit. You know? And I wanted, I made sure there was nothing politically correct about this factual, you know, because you know what comics are being put on trial in telling, you know, a gay joke or a black joke and you know, now, now the whole world, what do you think, you know, when, when Tmz stop and you go, what do you think of, you know, you know, Tosh, you know, Daniel tosh saying this, I go, it's a fucking joke. Isn't that the point? Are we allowed to comment on what goes on socially, you know, in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       And since when is someone joking and being serious at the same time since when is that a real statement? When someone's saying something that's obviously ridiculous, they don't really mean that. You're so stupid, you can't interpret that. You can't, you know, why are we, why are we running for office medians? And the idea is that when, when someone says something offensive, that's a joke. The idea is that somehow it's the exact same thing as saying something offensive about a person, whether it's a racist thing or a gay thing for being crude, having an argument and calling somebody a name. No, we're not saying it for an effect. That's right. And it's an art form and people, you know, this is, you know, a time where people need to really laugh. You know, I, I really want that, the New Year's Eve spot because you also know, you know, especially cause that hurricane happened on these coasts. And I know a lot of people don't go out, it's house parties and I just want this stomachs to fucking hurt from the things I'm saying on that stage. Well listen, I saw you in Vegas, me and Norton and funny and Oh yeah, yeah. Red Band came Sam, uh, from a opiate Anthony show and we had the fucking best time cause that's like, it's a rare treat for me to be able to

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       go and just sit down and be an audience member and enjoy. Yes. At a great show and seeing somebody that won't aw, no matter where. You know, the first time I even did Vegas years ago, uh, for, you know, for the comedy store when the comedy store was at the dunes, I got fired the second night, you know, full language, you know, and you know, is this you? Is this the new special yeah. It, yeah. I want, you know, I didn't, I didn't wear anything too intense as far as an outfit. I didn't want to go with the LVC jackets. You know, I went through it very street. I want to stage to look street, you know, is show you put on in Vegas was fucking awesome. I really enjoyed it for this, you know, prepared for it in Vegas and around the country. But I did, you know, just pissed you had 28 weeks in Vegas.

Speaker 4:          00:09:48       You know, I just wanted a tight, because as good as you think it might be when the cameras are rolling, like I said, you all going to fuck up a little, you know, you know, like I was doing this one bit where I left out a whole chunk of the bit because I was so into like performing for the crowd that after the show was over, you know, the producers were like, you know, my wife funes she goes, you left out this, this and this. You know. But that was the warmup, you know? And then the second show I came out to just annihilate the crowd and the crowd was, you know, it was bedlam. It was as insane as I was, you know, was, you know, it was very reminiscent of my first special as far as the audience reaction. The energy. Yeah. We did it in Chicago.

Speaker 4:          00:10:35       I mean the band kicked ass. I mean, do you feel like you're having like a resurgence? It's, it's a complete resurgence, you know? I mean, just by the response of the people, you know, years ago, you know, when I would say certain things with women, you know, it was the Ah, you know, that she say, you know, and today when I, when I, you know, when I tell them what piglets they've become duty years now, they got that fist pumping in the air. Like yeah, dice, dice, you know, for an error. Right. People are more accepting of fucked up shit now. But also people have changed because a lot of what I talk about his sexual, you know, and women have changed. They're the ones that wrote the material, you know, that, you know, you know, in this day and age, you know, I had a call from a friend of mine that was with a girl, went out with a thought, she was a sweet girl and you know, they wound up just doing everything imaginable to each other.

Speaker 4:          00:11:33       And he tells me, so I call it the next day, you know, you know, to see how she's doing, you know, letting her know, like it's not forgotten. Like I want to see you. And she goes, I'll call you right back. And she never even called me again. He said, he goes, I was the one night stand. But that's how things have changed, that they've become so aggressive. You know, you can't go by the face, you can't go by. Oh, she's got that girl next door look, you know, and the next thing you know, she's a contortionist view, you know, wrapping her feet around the back of her neck while you're banger. You know what I mean? That's what it is today. That didn't exist before. Well, you know why I didn't have one like that. You know, I haven't hit the contortionists thing, but you know, I always thought a woman in the bedroom or you know, in a subway, wherever you might be banging her at the time, you know, a dressing room, whatever a but car, whatever.

Speaker 4:          00:12:28       You know, when Allie, you know, should be the kind of woman she wants to be like that she doesn't have to hold back. Because I always felt like a lot of relationships, you know, like I'm married now for the third time and I feel a lot of relationships start, you know, splitting apart because people are an honest at the beginning about what they like, how they like to be. You know, years ago a woman wouldn't let you know all these little things that might, you know, push her buttons and sooner or later she's doing it with some other guy because she's now afraid to tell you what she's about. And you know, I would always let a woman, no, just be the pig that you are. If I had to say comedically, you know what I mean? Be what you want to be. I don't judge that way.

Speaker 4:          00:13:14       Yeah. I think slowly but surely everyone's going to just be what they want to be because of it. Yeah. But, but when you, when you were in a relationship and you don't start out that way, you know, that's where the problems could, could arise. Awesome. People grow in different directions, you know, that happens to one person would get freaky or the other person wants to settle down more. Well, you know what, you know, I, you know, I always said, what guy that's with a woman for a bunch of years in the audience? I go, what are you going to leave her? Just the fallen hate all over again. You know? Cause it always starts out nice. You know what I mean? And then a couple of years later, it's that fucking money grubbing a hole all the way to plaintiff. Yeah. How was, you know, so is it possible to break that chain?

Speaker 4:          00:13:57       How do you break that chain? You know, we're doing good, you know, me and my wife doing good. She seems happy. She's always smiling. You're always smiling when you weather. Yeah. She makes me happy. We make each other happy. Is it just a matter of getting the right combination, the right to humans? You know what it is. You really do have to search that out. And you know, I'm not going to sit here and make like, we'd never had an argument. I mean, she's Latin, you know? I mean, it gets crazy sometimes, but we always know that with tight, that's what keeps you together. I mean, an argument happens with anybody, but you got to know that, you know, you got all these other things in the relationship that keep you together. Right? Yeah, yeah. If you'd just, but that's, you know, but that's what I taught.

Speaker 4:          00:14:40       You know, when I, when I'm on stage, it's a different side of me. It's, you know, it's, you know, an animal unleashed that when I'm on a stage, I could just have the freedom to say things the way I see it and paint these crazy, almost like pornographic comedic cartoons for people. And they laugh because they know that doing it, you know what I mean? They know, you know, when you see a couple and you, you do, you know, with similar in that thing, you say what you feel onstage and whenever you see those couples that look at each other and laugh, those are the couples that go, how does he know? How does he know what an animal I am? You know what I mean? How does he know this? You know? But that's research. You know, you go through life and you learn different things. Research. Yeah. It's gotta be research. Yeah, absolutely. Everything is research really.

Speaker 2:          00:15:30       I was with a contortionist recently and I thought it would be amazing. I mean, I always picture it would be amazing, but she's always just really sore and she always has a fucked up Chin because there were Chin's always on the floor and shit. Like, really? Yeah. And I'm a Chin Guy. Like you have to have s I don't like wait Chan's where it's just like, Whoa, whoa. You know? And then when it's, when it's a nice Tampa, it's all like scratched up and rashy they use the bottom of the channel. They're always on their chins. Yeah. That's interesting to me. I, you know, I haven't hit that yet. Wow. We do any chin work. There's no chin work and us. What do you mean with the chin? Because like when they do contortionist

Speaker 5:          00:16:07       don't lie to me, our photo, it's a good mobile coming into the new year, just fucking around with me. I'm going to get 900% like a lot of times.

Speaker 4:          00:16:16       Well at Brown poodle photo for him.

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       Photo up at the Chins Chin. Okay. How would you even have that here? She worked. I have been, and I say where she works, but she, she uh, she would always be in a position where her face is always on the ground in a wet feet. Go all the way over the black brown hair like this, you know, so she's like sitting there like that. Just her, her, whenever she's doing contortion is, she's always on her chin here. I started some photos. If you look at a TV right there, like, uh, absolutely the snow you don't see like see like this right here, like this kind of stuff where she has her chin right here, girl that, you know, this is not her to seven, but

Speaker 5:          00:16:57       uh, no, he's just going seven year old woman. This is a woman, a woman. See that, that woman's legs, she's doing

Speaker 2:          00:17:09       chins on the ground. You'd never think about it. Pick a torsion is always happy. Patients are younger. If you're stepping on a head and you're in there, you know what I mean? That's no good. So that just a weird position to put your body. Yeah, that's not a position I could get into one thing and then in sexy, just don't think about it like, yeah, you look at their legs, bend really far back when you were putting them up above your legs, but you're not going like, all right now, can you been in this backwards? I just wouldn't make it a meatball or to stretch what you check before you begin. No, I don't. It's easily, it's probably better than a chick with a hamstring pull up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:17:42       If it was the opposite, like owl, don't pull my leg out. Be better off of the contortions. That's funny to me.

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       Oh yeah. Yeah. See he looks like a nice guy, right? He looks like no, but I'm saying it looks like a regular nice guy, but look what he's into. Well, you just gave it a shot. In his defense, he didn't necessarily say he was into it. You've got a girlfriend right now. Sure. Yeah. No, nothing steady. Yeah, I have. Yeah. I have a steady in a, yeah, to what does that even mean? It means he's retarded. If you didn't know what you just went, this is called a web. A Web. You got caught in a spiderweb, the spiderweb of retardation. It sticks to you and you're like, oh my God, I'm in this conversation and I can't get out. What the fuck did I do? What did I engage him? And you're trying to pull yourself out of struggle, but now you know we're into something.

Speaker 5:          00:18:38       What's going on? I don't know why you're invested in this, you know? But what happened? I'm just dating. That's I guess the easiest way to say it. I should say dating. He's trying to, you know, I like you. You know I'm not starving down. You know I'm dating now. That's what a girl says, that she broke up with a guy up to six months. Well, I'm starting to date. You see what I mean? Yeah, I know. Yeah. I'm just trying not to jump right into a relationship. Very cool podcast here. You can't use expressions like that. Yeah, you can't do, you know, and I like you, we're friends. What am I supposed to say? You know, I'm banging a few of them out, right.

Speaker 5:          00:19:15       The show. You know what I mean? You know, I throw a load this way. I splurged all over this one before I came to work just for a golf. You know what I mean? Things like that. It needed the show. You gotta realize you never got to go back to this a podcast. That's the beauty of that. She can say what you want. You never going to go back to being an accountant again. This will never haunt you. It was he an accountant. He used to sell computers. Europe, he's a good guy. Very good guy. But you know, he's got to hit a mouthful. It's a mass. Well, you're with them a lot, but a mess and no doubt that he's a great guy. I'm just messing a good way. Like what is, what's going on? I mean, at one side of his mouth I'm pink, socking Asians, making them pee a little.

Speaker 5:          00:20:01       But what I'm saying is deciding your mouth. You're talking about dating and on the other side you're showing girls, you know, twisting themselves into pretzels. But that wasn't really like a sexual thing. No, no, but it can be. Yes, because what he said, that's what he saying. Brian, you just retarded yourself out. Now you're cutting your own web, your own weapons wrapped you right. We'll leave him alone. He's got it. He's in his defense. He's a very unusual dating situation. It seems to be working out and he doesn't want to talk about him in the air. Right. So what do you want to talk about that we were talking about you. We are, we are, um, I try not to be so like crazy with myself. I really tried to stay like grounded

Speaker 4:          00:20:47       in what I do because it does feel a little crazy right now with what's going on. Like you said about a resurgence and well, you seem real excited about comedy again to like, you know, you know what it is. I've watched a lot of the specials and when I spoke to showtime about this, you know, I had a couple of rules because I even told my director a Scotsman Toya, I said, look, you know you're going to go through something now. This isn't going to be like the other specials you've done. You're going to, you know, your head is going to change color because of this. You know, you're going to go through it with me now. You're going to be a different man when you come through this. And what was funny is he, when we were going to do the special, he spoke to Joe does, you know, and he goes, you know, he taught me, you know, it goes to d as it goes, you know, I'm thinking of doing a special with dice, what do you think?

Speaker 4:          00:21:39       And he goes, well I think he's great but you're going to go through it. You know, you know he's crazy when it comes to these things. And I am, because all the way from the performance to the editing, I want it to be perfect. I want people like, like in a capsule because I really don't want to do any more specials. Like I'm going to do the road now I'm just finishing up, you know, deal with the hard rock in Vegas, a long term deal. And you know, I want to do what I do on the road. Now. What are you going to do at the hardrock? Same thing you would do at the river. Yeah. Doing Monkey. Uh, yeah, I'm going to do like two weeks at a clip and go into a, uh, what's the name? Vinyl. It's a rock club, you know, and like I said, I base my act on rock and roll, so I like a certain setting, you know, it's not that big of a room, you know, it's just there.

Speaker 4:          00:22:29       I was just in Vegas, uh, two weeks ago. It's great. The new hard rock is grain. Well, you know, you know, with what I do in that hotel, it really fits. And you know, Vegas is somewhere I like to be a lot. So, you know, on the road, you know what it is, you go into a couple thousand seats, it's one time a year. But Vegas, I like doing like 20 weeks, 24 weeks a year. And you know, me and my wife just go nuts there. We have a great time. And you know, it's like a home away from home. Why did you choose Vegas to work out your shows? Why'd you decide to do it that way and not do it in la? Well, I was, I was doing clubs around the country, you know, so I did that. I did the, you know, like the governor's, all those clubs, you know, but, but Vegas was like a steady thing.

Speaker 4:          00:23:15       It was, it almost became like my comedy store. So, you know, I was at the Las Vegas Hilton for a while working on it. And then we went the Riv before the Hilton and then we went back to the river because I, I was never into the room at the Hilton to start with. But you know, you have, you know, I have a, you know, invest is in the show and you know, we tried it, but the river was a great room to really just work it out, do as long as set as I want, and really just make everything tight and develop the material with, with an audience that's coming to see me. So when you have the people that are paying to come see you, you know, if the material is good, because that's the fans. Now when you go on places like the comedy store, you're going to get those people that you know, look at you and go, what did he just say?

Speaker 4:          00:24:01       I want to leave now. You know, and I didn't want to deal with that. I want the real audiences. I thought that was a brilliant idea to do it at the Riv, uh, for, for that reason that you would get all your people there, but also because the place has so much fucking history. Oh yeah. Such a crazy hotel. I get people that perform this, the, you know, from Sinatra, Sammy Davis to, uh, you know, comics like Milton Berle and you know, Jack Benny, who personally, I wasn't ever even fucking in tow because like I say, I wasn't, I was never that much into standups. But you know, when you're on a stage that, you know, Sinatra was on, I did a lot of rooms like that in Vegas. I did 'em before they knocked it. Uh, what was the stardust? I did the status for a few years. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:24:46       And that was one of the best stages because that stage, you know, you had the stage that you, you're on like this and then it had a, what's it called? Like a runway that went right through the entire audience. And they don't build stages like that anymore. So I was lucky enough to play some of those Bally's hotel I did for 13 years. Isn't it crazy with those old Vegas hotels that when they're done with them, they explode them? It's crazy because you know, I think, you know, pee, you know, I know a lot what goes on in Vegas and like these people that just bought the Sahara want to make it like more of a boutique hotel. Again, you know, for high role is not a lot of kids, you know, not a thousand floors up. You know, it was smaller place where people really feel that old school Vegas feel.

Speaker 4:          00:25:36       Right. And I also think they, this is really becoming a place for comedy, not just comedy. Falive entertainment because of recession. You know, when people come to Vegas, if they're going to go to a show, they want to see somebody familiar to them. Right. You know, so that's why a lot of comics are moving there, you know? And that's why a lot of, you know, you see people like share performing that just sort of guns and roses there. You know, it's that type of place. Now they want to see people that are fans of, they don't want to see just, you know, a bunch of midgets on Bungee cord jumping around to the Beatles music. You know, you could probably do like a weekly show in Vegas and never have to travel anywhere and just made people traveling. I want it to you. I want it to her, you know, I owe it to myself.

Speaker 4:          00:26:22       I owe it to, to the fans that, you know, have been with me all these years. I'm doing this a long time. So I really want to do that big tour again. And I don't know how, how, you know, the kinds of rooms I'll do yet, but I mean, just on things that are on sale already, they're going through the roof, you know, and the special has an ed, but people know it's coming. And you know, ever since I did entourage, I have this whole new audience and, and they, and I'll always get that. When can I see a comedy special? You're doing a comedy special. So I really prepared for it. I really took it serious. You know, when I see guys preparing for specials, but just fucking around on stage, that bothers me. I'm like, they all want to be superstars. They all want to fill, you know, the staple center.

Speaker 4:          00:27:07       But nobody's putting in the work to do that, you know? And I know you're a hard worker. That's why I feel free to tell you this stuff. And I know you give everything you got on stage. I mean, you know, when, you know, it's funny, when I was coming up you weren't run around, right. So you know, you had, you had myself, you had Sam Kennison who was screaming his head off. And then one night I walk into the store and I'm like, I'm seeing, you know, just style wise, almost a blend of Kennison and me coming through you, but even more intense when you would scream it. That's why I love them. I'm going, who the fuck is this? That the night I came in you were about, you know, deciding in your head. I could tell if you want to just smash this guy's skull in and I'm going now.

Speaker 4:          00:27:57       That's funny. You know what I mean? Because nobody came along since, you know, like I did an album called the data left the died because Rick Rubin who produced five of my albums, you know, he did like, you know, he, he, he like he was the one that brought wrap to the scene. He's the one that bought the black Crowes and you know, bands like that. I mean he produced, you know, rolling stone albums, you know, and he say to me, you know it in the early nineties he'd go, you're the end of comedy. There's no way to go after this. You know, and then he has this maniac on stage. I mean I came in in the middle of your acts. I had to like watch the way you walk, you know, because she would just, you know, this has got to be 15 years ago, maybe even more and you know, so you were so young and just your face was beet red, you know, and I'm going, I know this guy, I didn't know your name cause I just came walking in from the front door.

Speaker 4:          00:28:54       I go, he's going to kill this guy in the third row. And I don't know what over, it's a comedy show, but that's the shit that makes me laugh. And then one night, Eleanor, this is not even that long ago, I was destroying somebody in, you know, in, in the original room at the comedy store and that's when you came up with, I love dice mean. And she told that to me. I go, does he really? He, she goes, he just loves you. And he loves when you get angry because he knows you're really getting at, it was one of my favorite things at the comedy store to be in the back. I would, we be, we'd be in the back talking and someone would yell in the hallway, dice got a heckler. It's like we had a fish on, you know, it's like we got to now, you know, and we would all run in, in the back and just watch you just eviscerate people when you would get really mean when people look at you.

Speaker 4:          00:29:44       Because I would really see, see I'm not fake on stage and I'm emotional, so fun doing like a great bit that I know is great. And in the middle of it, you know, I hear a guy yelling out little Bo peep. Yeah, I'm going to get angry at that person, you know? And uh, you know, it's not even about heckling that person. It's about knowing I've mentally hurt him for years to come. But I like to know with great timing and comedy scale, you got to stay with it. Yeah. But it's like you really want to hurt the person I'm going to cross. You know what I mean? Now it's at the level where we throw people out, you know, which, you know, first I'll have the heckle fight. Well, you did that in Vegas. You, you threw a guy out, the guy in the front row, two minutes into the show, the guy was so drunk he couldn't even communicate with you.

Speaker 4:          00:30:35       You like, this is not good. And I can't deal with that. It's like, why that drunk? I had a guy, I was at a governor's a few months ago. Do you remember this, Valerie? With the blind guy? Yeah. Okay. So this guy is just drunk and he's wearing dark sunglasses. Just looking like a dice clone, you know, that guy's gotta be, you know, 50, you know, or in his forties, whatever. So I'm going back and forth with them a little bit, you know, I figured out, I'll always give a person a chance, but the guy now I get back into the act and he starts in some more. So you know, you know, you got pretty tough bounces there, you know, and I go, do me a favor, get rid of this fucking asshole of a human being. You know what I mean? Just throw them the fuck out.

Speaker 4:          00:31:20       So now after the show, Don Jamison was opening for me that night and he would sell his t shirts at the front of the club, you know, so he comes to the dressing room and he goes, you just missed the greatest thing I ever saw in comedy and go, why? What happened? He goes, you know, that guy you threw out, it took number one for bounces. He had like retarded strength. He goes, but he was blind, you know, and he was swinging his stick at them. He, he ran, he tried to run. And he smashed right into a wall and he turned around and he was fighting these guys and he was winning. You know, going, he's coming back in the room, he's going to kick dices ass. I mean, that's what a comedy show is today. Who's going to kick somebody's ass? And I'm going, how the fuck did I know he's blonde.

Speaker 4:          00:32:10       You know what I mean? The Guy, you know, I've had guys come to my show wearing the glasses and the fingerless gloves. How am I going to know the guy? He's blind, you know? And then dragging them out of the room. He was starting to fight them on the way out of the room, you know, which is entertaining to me, you know, this way I get to laugh a little, you know what I mean? You know? Why should the audience always be the one to have a good laugh to make me fucking laugh, you know? So when Don told me, I went, Don told me the story of the blind guy really was laughing. It was very enjoyable. But the other side of me was I went to throw him the guy out if I knew he was blind, that it, you know, how do you do that?

Speaker 4:          00:32:46       You know, kicking a cripple that's a wheelchair. So was he hacking on w he was just, but it was, it was drunk and it was, you know, it wasn't coherent stuff. And I'm going, okay, ash, whole face, you know, which is, uh, one of my newest Heco lines where, you know, if a guy's a real asshole, I'll tag them with that name and I'll keep going, asshole face. And then I start getting angry and I go, I'm not saying you're an asshole. I go, I know you've been called that a thousand times in your life. Goes to the kind of person you are. What I'm saying to you is, I think you have a face that resembles a fucking asshole. And that's what I truly think of you. You know Damn Shit that you wake up in the middle of the night when you go to take a leak.

Speaker 4:          00:33:31       No. I'll tell you what happens mentally when you say no, no, this is what happens with that c, let's say it's a guy in Vegas with his friends. Hey asshole face. You know, so those friends that are with him now, these buddies of 20 years, you know that night they're going to come on air. So face let's go have a drink. And it's funny the next day, even maybe even a week later, but three years later when the corner house and the kids are picking up the phone to go and put ass off face on the phone, that's when the guys call him. Why did I ever say a fucking word at that show? Because now forever he's asshole face. That's a multi tiered solution. I like how you played that out, but I really think about that stuff. I go, what would hurt in the long run? That's like some humbling chest shit, right?

Speaker 4:          00:34:17       Like if you call it, I've heard you call people and say, hey, you're a fucking asshole. They don't even hear it because they've been called but to, but to tag them and let them know they have a face that resembles an ace. No. Even if they don't just give them that, you know, normally the ones I pick out has it. And you know what I mean? I really looked for a guy that ha, I don't want to give a guy in named that doesn't fit him. You know what I mean? So he's sort of Hash to have a face that resembles, that's heckler. Herpes is what that's called. Yeah. It just keeps coming back to haunt you because that's the fan. That was another time, you know, it, it's, you know, Max was with me and um, this, you know, this guy was fucking with Eleanor on stage and his girlfriend I think, or his wife.

Speaker 4:          00:35:05       So I come on stage and the minute he opened his mouth, I'm like, throw this mother fucker around. Oh No. I wasn't on stage. And what happened was I start yelling at the, uh, you know, the promoters of the shot. I go get that fucking guy out of the room. If he's bad with ty, he's not even gonna let me get started. But it wasn't good enough for me that they throw him out. I come out the back door, I'm going to fight the guy, you know. Well Eleanor is stolen stage, you know, so I figured there's a little time, you know, and my wife Wa was yelling at your phone, is it my phone? What? Go fuck with these things. I don't know how he, unfortunately, I think you've also told that story. It's happy face, happy face. Yeah. And uh, wait, let me shut this.

Speaker 4:          00:35:50       Who's happy things? Uh, he's, he's, he's with me for like 25 years already. He's a, he does security from it. He's into what you're into, you know, with the fire. He's got, uh, you know, martial arts schools on the east coast and his name's happy face. Well, it's names Mike Malandra, you know, but it's happy face. Everybody calls him happy for it. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, cause I'll always like tried to smile at a guy when he's throwing them out and you know, he's, you know, he's a pretty deadly guy. And that's what I love about him being happy face. I mean it's a great name. He got his job, you know how he got to get love, negative happy faces. A great fucking West. Also happy west as bad as good.

Speaker 4:          00:36:35       Well happy faces with me like 25 years. And the way he got us the job was I would work out in a gym in a Gold's gym in Jersey and we would just start talking and you know, then we work out a little together and he's happy faces about five, seven, you know. But he's not that big, you know. But he would talk about his martial arts school. How his father taught him. They both had the school, you know, and he, you know, like you know, like a father, like son, he followed in his footsteps. So He's standing between the two owners of the gym, which what animals? These guys were like, you know, the type that bench three 50 a hundred times, you know, the big guys. So I said happy face. They go, you know, with my shows, I don't like, you know, we were talking about him like working for me, cause I had club Soda Kenny who's like six, five big, you know.

Speaker 4:          00:37:29       And I said, so I looked at happy face like he's the sniper, you know, they'd never see him coming. I go, but we don't like to hurt anybody. I go, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to try to get pissed, Jill, and you've got to stop me without hurting me. And this guy put me down. My ass didn't even touch the ground. That's how fast he moved. But at first he's gone, I don't want to touch you. He goes, I came to the Meadowlands to see, you know, he goes, I can't, you know, I go, well that's the game. You can't hurt me. That's it. And he did this, move, this, this move on me. That just puts the department always hurt you if you're resisting and hurt, you get hurt. Just scrambling. That's right. But he popped me down in that night. He was working for me and that was the beginning of happy face. That's a nice name. I like it. Yeah. And I love his temper. When he gets mad. It's a lot of fun to make them get angry. You know, it's funny talking about like, cause he didn't like the name Mike the Murderer. So that's fascinating. Well yeah, he starts screaming about that. Don't call me that, you know, it's a touchy situation, you know. You know what I'm calling, it's just a name. He but don't call me

Speaker 6:          00:38:35       that, you know. Yeah. People don't want that murderous. No, but he's happy face for 25 years, so he's happy. But that's why he's calling me the comedy store was always the worst place in the world for heckling because there was no crowd control whatsoever. Nothing. Nothing. You would think. Like when I, when I lived in Boston and we were at stitches, stitches is when, uh, that's where I did my first open mic. And uh, I had, uh, been really inspired by you, really inspired by a Kennison and a few other guys. And I was, I was really like looking forward to doing some, you know, trying to do some standup comedy. And you think back then like what the, what the face of comedy was like and what it's like now. Yeah. See it's all like blank to me right now and I'm not pitching on it, but I don't find, you know, I'll flip around the channels, just see if somebody is on, stopped watching for a few minutes.

Speaker 6:          00:39:33       But like I say, these guys don't put a lot into their, um, into dead snow. There's nobody developing a persona, you know? And those are the kind, you might not realize it, but you'll have a persona. You know what I mean? People come to see Joe Rogan, they know what they're getting, you know, but there aren't too many guys. It's almost like, like, like white bread, you know, this, there's no persona up there. So even if the material's decent, you know, a lot of material has been done. A lot of guys covered the same subjects. I'd rather see a guy that's more entertaining that I could go to. You fucking believe what he's doing up there. That's the kind of act I like to see. When we were in Boston and we were starting out and we're like looking at the face of comedy, the comedy store was always Maca.

Speaker 6:          00:40:16       That was always like that fucking place where you'd make the pilgrimage and everybody goes see the, these see this stage where you performed the Kennison performance. Richard Pryor and let her, but when I got there and when I got there, like I forget who was on stage with some road hack. Uh, the, the, the place was half fall and uh, some guy's yelling out shit in the back of the room and no one's kicking them out. Nobody. And this was, this was like my first experience at the commerce body guards at the Dorman, a comic. Nobody wants to get into it. Only Harris. Pete Harris. Pete would get down, get down, he would throw dudes out. I went to a Tony Danza knock him out. Oh really? Yeah, because you know how condescending Harrison, you guys, Tony Danza box just wanted to come in. Yeah. Nicest. Kobe. You know, Tom, I don't know if you know, but he's just this friendly guy, kick ass, you know. And Harris gave him a hard time and he put his hands on him. Uh, you know, like you can't just walk in and he just gave them one shot and he went flying down the stairs. Wow. Really funny. Poor, really enjoyable. Harris's such an angry guy for whatever reason. He's such an angry guy. It took me a year to get even the tiniest compliment from that guy. Yeah, that's it.

Speaker 6:          00:41:33       Negative, negative. Yeah. He just left the world he liked, just got on his motorcycle. But I do have to say when the guy gave you props, it meant something, you know, I for some reason it did the back well, it would like him to be a little bit more fair with them. You know what I'm saying? What you know, it's like getting a compliment from him was like getting one from Mitzi for some reason it was called what it is cause he was always there and he saw everybody before. That's true too. You know, whether or not to be impressed with you or not, or whether or not you are just bullshit in the crowd. But he was also just negative, but also the comedy store, I think, you know, somebody like you would like it. And myself was, that was the bad boy comedy club.

Speaker 6:          00:42:14       It still is. You know, it's like you say it's a free for all. You go over to the Improv, which is a great club, but it's, everything is run at the comedy store. Nobody even knows who's running things, any madness. And it was more madness then than it is now. I think it's probably a way better managed now than it was back in the early days. But man, it was insane. But when I came along it was 94. That's when I was first started performing there. And uh, I just, I was blown away, but it was like the place was like crackling. It's like the magic of all those sets in the walls and with the store you ever noticed. You could go there some nights, you know, the Sunday, Monday nights, and it's as fun as could be. And crazy. And then there were certain nights when you come there like that.

Speaker 6:          00:42:59       And just the vibe is bad. Just the wrong combination of people that you go, you know what I'm getting at here. It's just that bad fucking vibe. And then just other nights just insane. Great. Yeah. It's an amazing club. You know, just the history. I still love it. I still love going there. I still love going on the stage. Yeah. I can't go back because of the falling out that I had with them. I didn't know about that. The dementia issue, you didn't know, but you're not allowed back courses. I never went back. I never would go back when they, uh, they banned me from that and I'm like, you guys are out of your fucking mind. Yeah. But if he weren't banned then you wouldn't be a comedy store. Ma, I got bandwidth for that Mitzi band. Maybe once for my j Howard Marshall Joke. I had this joke about, uh, about the old dude that, uh, that fucked and Nicole Smith and I was one of my favorite jokes.

Speaker 6:          00:43:53       It's a quick joke. She hated it. It was just about, you know, that everyone was saying, oh, it's such a, it's so sad to watch his poor old man, you know, and like, like he's, he's getting, he's getting robbed and this woman's just here for his money. And I'm like, don't you think he knows that was 90 years old. He made $1 billion from scratch. You know, chances are he's a tad crafty. Like how do you want him to die? And then it was this whole death scenario, like on you go off to a bunch of dirty shit. And I love the bit, but it was a lie. It was about old people. She did not like it. And I think she banned me once for that. She banned me wants or something else too, but it will only take a little time. My kids were even banned from there. I had

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       a thing with Paula years ago, like when I first broke up with my wife, you know, I'd always bring my kids to the comedy store at night and you know, Eleanor would hang with them, you know, so one night, you know, I mean Dylan, who's now 18, you know, it was only 11 you know, and you know, I'm seeing, I'm pulling in the comedy pulley had a hamburger joint when he was 12 years old at the Westwood comedy store. So I know Paulie grown up since he's that age. So he goes, how many times I got to tell you, don't bring your fucking kid in here. You know? And I was like, I already said that like that. But he was standing there, my kid was there, so I go, Dylan, I forgot, I think he was with Steve Simone. I go, Steve, take them outside. You know, I go, you know, like I was going to have to hurt him at that moment, you know, but I didn't want, you know, but I, I got, I didn't get physical, you know, you can't do that stuff, but poorly told his mother that I threw a glass at him.

Speaker 5:          00:45:27       So she banned me and the kids, you know, my kids were, Ben did 11 and 15 from the comment, which is so great. I go and my son Max loved it because he understood it. He was old enough to understand it. And uh, and then one night Mitzi comes in and Illinois was sitting with a and saying, no, no, that's not what happened. I was right in the kitchen when it happened. He didn't throw a glass of poorly. She goes, if anything, he would have caved his skull and you know, he just threw the glass in the garbage on his way out. And she, you know, her voice, she's, well, I knew that Andrew went through something like that. You know, he wouldn't go to that level. Yeah. You wouldn't know. I would never, I was never, you know, that's not what I do. I can see you hitting somebody.

Speaker 5:          00:46:08       Yeah. Well, you know, but I can't hit somebody unless they try to hurt me. You know, it was more like I just laid into him for it and on the way out of the kitchen, the back door, like through my glass and it broke on the wall, you know, and the other garbage can there. But Paulie was out in the hallway. He was nowhere near it. But it was, you know, and we made up, of course, we're friends today and you know, we laugh about all the nonsense, but you know, it's just a crazy place. I mean sometimes tend to show you would love this. You weren't even out there yet. This is like, I'm talking like 86 87 so me and Kennison would be the last acts of the night. Every night she'd put us on back to back. And it was either he went on first or I went on first and like to end the show.

Speaker 5:          00:46:51       Sometimes if he'd go on first, you know, I'd be on stage. And you know, once he'd get bored with it, he'd throw a chair at me on stage and then the whole fight would happen on the stage with called the would jump and you would just see who's ever in the audience because the audience is terrorists. They don't know what's going on. They don't know. You know, I'm falling over the front tables knocking people love and people are just running out of the place. Like what the fuck is this? Like all breaks loose. There was so many great fake fights at the comedy store cause that's the one thing comics lift to do. We love being children. Todd Barron, Tom like the king

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       of that Shit. Let's talk to him last night about you. He loves you to death and uh, he's like, you should bring it up. How he used to, did he used to go on the road with you or did you

Speaker 4:          00:47:39       dawn, I would put don in whatever I was in, I would put him in, like, we wound up doing this, this crazy frank Stallone movie in Ixtapa, you know, uh, Mexico and we were stuck there for like five weeks. And of course I made, I made dawn do like Alfred Hitchcock and the movie, there was no call for Alfred Hitchcock, but I talked to producers into it, you know, and that's where he actually hurt, hurt his foot. You know how he's got like a bad foot. Yeah, he hurt his foot. Well, what happened with don? He always wants to fight me, you know, so, so one day, you know, he starts in with me on the set and it's all these Mexican crew members that don't even understand English. And he puts his foot like there was a hole in the ground and he wouldn't go to the hospital after to fix it, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:48:31       So to this day, like he just moves the wrong way and he's crippled, you know, he just falls down. And it was funny. What happened was I went back to a Madison Square Garden in 2000 and it was Don's job at the time to come there because he really wants to see it with my wife and my sons. So he was the problem on the plane because what happened was he's walking down an aisle and the foot goes and he's, you know, Don's emotional, you know, so he's screaming, laying on the floor and the flame scaring, scaring the entire flight, you know, and then they get him into a chair and the foot felt better, you know, so it was that the cops were at the airport to question him and I go, you a job was to just bring them here. That was the gift. You get to fly for nothing and get a hotel room, bring them in and you cause a problem on the fucking airline. But that's done. You know, that's who he is. You think he was his practical jokes?

Speaker 2:          00:49:33       No. He was laying at norms. No, no, no.

Speaker 4:          00:49:39       Really goes, his foot really goes, is it a broken foot? Is it a ligament? I'm sure he'd like chips, something in his ankle and he just wouldn't go to the house. He goes, well, they're going to do to me, you know, he turns into this baby, you know? Oh yeah. And he would do the road with me, you know, and I had it when he would do the road with, I would just take them with me when he would do the road. I had a, at that time I had Eddie Griffin with me. I had, yeah. So Eddie Griffin was like the real open, you know. And so what would happen is I'd give Don 10 minutes right upfront. So we'd be on a big tour bus, traveling the country. And one time he's on the bus and he's like, you know how he gets down on himself, you know, like almost like that he's not crying with tears, but I'm going down.

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       It's because the crowd doesn't respond the way he wants. You know, cause he would come out singing, tie a yellow ribbon, you know, you know, with, with the music over it and get the crowd clapping. And so now the song ends and then he goes into another one. It'll go into like Copa Cabana. So now he's on the bus complaining about that. Go Don, it's your 10 minutes after they get the joke of who you are that you're this fucking goofball. Well now where are the jokes? You know? And he would go, well, you know, I went into the other, so I go, they don't want to hear another, you already did the big, you had them clap. Now they've got a clap to Barry Manilow singing, you know, Copa Cabana, who gives a fuck? You know what I mean? And nobody gives a fuck. You create the character, you just fucking big goofball and now give him jokes, you know? And, but we had a lot of fun and then that would be another rumble on the bus. Now it's in jumping on me and trying to kill me on the bus. Yeah, he's in his life is constant theater with that guy. I didn't, did I,

Speaker 2:          00:51:31       that's who I hang out with every single day from midnight to about 4:00 AM Tom Barrett. And, you know, it was hysterical with the movie. We did an extensive,

Speaker 4:          00:51:41       but uh, date they want them to stay and film for longer than I, I wanted to be there, you know, and I'm gone. I gotta get Outta here. I got gigs, I got to dose. So they promised me a lot of, a lot of money, you know, in like cash and in Taiwan, you know, through the whole shoot is going, they're never giving it to you. You've got to get it now. I got done, they're going to pay me. We made a deal. That's it. You know, Eh, you know, and you know, the, it was a crazy set, you know, I mean, I never went through anything like this in a film ever. You know what went on in those five weeks. And so he's gone, you know, two to five weeks. I've got to hear how they're not going to pay me, you know, he's just on me that the, and of course they give me the money and dawn had a tape it up, you know, all over my body.

Speaker 4:          00:52:27       Like that movie midnight express it. You Willing? Yeah. Because you know, it was a part of Mexico that we actually thought that the director was going to happen. He stopped at the airport, you know, so you know, with thinking, all right, how am I going, cause you're not allowed more than like $10,000 in cash. And this was a lot of money, you know? So he was taping it with this like paper tape to my chest, to my thoughts. You know, that when I got home, you know, and when we're going through the airport, I'm gone, they're going to stop me, I'm going to be in jail and whoever stops and he's going to be rich, you know, it's that simple. But they didn't stop us. And now I get home and I take off my shirt and my wife sees all this money taped to my chest and she's going, what is that?

Speaker 4:          00:53:15       You know? And I'm going, no, they paid me. You know, that's how they pay you in Mexico, you know? But Tom was just so sure they're not paying for them. It was just crazy. It was, I wouldn't eat, we only had one meal a day because everybody on the set was getting sick. You know, everybody was going to the hospital and it and all we had every day was um, we went to the same restaurant about four o'clock every day. We had pasta with sauce, garlic bread and Coca Cola would purified ice and we wouldn't eat until the next day at the same time. Cause we figured we'd make it the middle of the day because we're only getting that one meal. We're not eating any of the food there. Wow. Yeah. And he lost like 30 pounds. Fine. He's, he's gone. I got to eat something, you know, he's going, this is ridiculous step.

Speaker 4:          00:54:05       We're not eating food, you know, but everybody's fallen at the waist side. What are we going to do? We got no chick. This is survival. My friend. Those be movie sets can be very fucking sketchy. And it was for a long time. Was it five weeks of the same food? But I'm a kid. I could do that. I could eat the same thing every single day. But you want it like twice a day, but the restaurant would close like nine at night, so we'd have to wait until the next day at four o'clock to have the next meal. Wow. Bottled water, you know? And that was it. Bottled water and pasta once a day. What's the name of this movie? It was called the good life. It never came out, you know? And I always talked to frank Stallone. He always says he should release like pieces of it on the Internet.

Speaker 4:          00:54:50       Yeah. It was the craziest thing, you know? Uh, I wanted it to be a comedy. Frank Stallone wanted it to be a drama, you know, because, because, you know, I would tell the producers, I go, you know, it's really a funny movie, you know, and comedy cells, right? So when frank would do a scene, he'd come over to the director and go, you know, how was that? And he goes, well, it was very dramatic, you know, and he's gone, well, it's supposed to be a drama. And he goes, well, I think it should be funnier. And he goes, but the movie's a fucking drama. Like, so he was flipping out at, we had a big fight over that movie, but uh, but the producers now want to just be like a comedy. Dennis Hopper's in it. It was supposed to be, you know what it was supposed to be. It was supposed to be Goodfellas on a golf course. So Dennis Hopper,

Speaker 2:          00:55:41       Dennis Hopper was in it, but it was filming. Really. Can you find it anywhere? It's snow would be, but it doesn't, yeah. It's not online, but no one put it online. But David Carradine was in it too. Yeah. A lot of people were in the Angelos investors to the loans in it. That's hilarious. And he never made it. You should never know shit to Netflix or something like that. You'll make it.

Speaker 4:          00:56:03       It's, well, it's not my movie to sell, but you know, it just wound up, the whole time in Ixtapa was drama, you know? But it, the movie's hysterical. You know, it was just movie sets. I've only been on one. I've been on well to be movie movies. But you know what happened? We had a good director at the beginning, and then the producer who was an attorney fired the director and he decided to direct a no. So now what happens is, this is where it starts going a little crazy. Uh, and I, you know, I can't play golf. I hate fucking golf. I don't have patients to hit a one little ball, you know, of course the park, whatever, you know. So I wasn't really good at playing the golf, you know, so we would make it that they make fun at me, but I had some like golf material at the time.

Speaker 4:          00:56:52       We had talked about hating golf. So the, the, this new director makes me do some of that material on like the mass to shot, like on a crane. So he goes, I want you to do that monologue every time, you know? And I go, no, but I'm not doing that monologue every time I did a few, cause you asked me to do it in the mass of the shot, just so you get some talking. And he goes, no, I want you to do it. I go, that's my material from my act. I don't want to do it. You know, you're not paying me for it all year. And he goes, you'll do what I say. I'm not going to do a fucking thing. You say, I go and don't ever tell me what to do again. Ever in front of the camera. Which Dom Barris is falling down laughing as he's making a little documentary movie with my camera, because I was always filming.

Speaker 4:          00:57:37       He did. He literally say, you'll do as I say, yeah, whoever lands. And he goes and he, and he says, if you don't like it, you could leave. So I said, okay, I'll leave. I go done. Let's go. And I had calypso to Kenny. They, I go, let's say. He goes, well, my attorneys will be in touch. I go, asshole, you told me to leave to say you don't want me in the movie. If I don't want to do my own material and I don't want to do it, so don't fucking tell me what to do and I'll stay and that's it. You know? And what don loved is, no matter what the guy did, you know, for his main profession, he goes, you're telling you a director, the guy that supposed to tell you what to do, don't ever tell me what to do again, but that is only job right now is telling you what to do.

Speaker 4:          00:58:20       I go, yeah, but you heard what went down, you know, and he agreed with it. And then I decided to direct part of the special, it's not the special the movie. And um, cause I come to the set one day and it's like 110 degrees. And this guy, you know, the guy directing it was, you know, he had a funny character. He was very low keyed with a sombrero cause it was Mexico and it was always hot. And I go, uh, what are we doing today? And he goes, I don't know. You know, and I go, do you want me to set the shot up? And he goes, would you please, this is the director now. He goes, just tapped out. He goes, I just want to finish the movie and go home. And that's how he would talk. That's like an impression of the guy.

Speaker 4:          00:59:05       So now I'm directing, I'm directing the movie and that was a scene I directed. This was great because I was like a little at war with frank still at the time on the set. So I was shooting a scene that I needed Don Barris for and now I decided to club soda. Kenny will be in the movie also, you know. So frank is shooting a scene where he's like playing a guitar in his underwear, talking to some girl he was with in bed the night before. So I come in there and I take the sound guys, I'm like, come on, just come with me. So now I got the sound guy. So he winds up shooting the soul scene that he's doing and he doesn't know, he doesn't have sound. And all of a sudden coming from this house, you hear him screaming, he tucked the fucking sound guys, you made me do all these takes and we don't even have fucking sound.

Speaker 4:          00:59:59       And then the director's going, well dices directing a scene right now, you know? And he goes, why the fuck is he directing anything? It's not his movie to direct. I mean, people were having, and then we crashed the golf carts, which I got in trouble for. I played chicken with the, you know, Peta Dobson, he's an actor. No. Um, he's been in a lot of stuff anyway, so it's me and Dobson, we're good friends and decide to play chicken with the golf carts. And I turned at the last second and my golf cock gets completely destroyed and frank goes flying out of it because he's with me going, what are you doing as what? Going towards each other and I'm going to just stick with me on this. He goes, I don't want to stick with you. Stopped driving, you know, but we wouldn't stop driving.

Speaker 4:          01:00:45       And I turned and they smash him. I, so now I'm not allowed to be in the golf cart. Chicken. Yeah. Chicken to see who turns first, you know, and then we're having sword fights with the golf clubs. I mean, it was ridiculous what was going on. You know, Beverly Deangelo's in the movie, uh, frank pressures in the Moodle is your war with Frank Stallone? What was that? I believe the movie should be a comic, you know, so I started doing like an impression of him on screen cause I could do him really well the way he stands and you know, so now he sees the final kind and he goes, what are you doing behind me? You know, I go an impression of you. He goes, you're not supposed to be doing an impression of me. I'm, I'm the leader of the gang. But it's funny. And he goes to put the movies not funny, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:01:33       And of course we all made up if you know movie, you know, never came out, you know, make up with everybody you make up with Paul. You made up a dark guy. Yeah. Because it's more fun to have your friends. Are you going to make up and laugh about it? You and dom Irrera ever going to make up, you know, it's not that I'm even like mad at a guy like I rare. Right. You know, he's just stupid. You know what I mean? You know, I really don't. I like both of you. I wish you guys would, uh, work that out. What does nothing to work out, you know, just call them stupid. I'd say you have an issue. Well, calling somebody stupid in saying, I don't like the guy at two different things. Here we go. He's a great comic. I think he's a great comedian, but you know, he's, he's just too bitter for me. You know what I mean? You know, he, when you and him, I've always had like

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       this, it's agonizing.

Speaker 5:          01:02:22       Always had it with you used to, you know, I came in to Philly years ago and you know, I would headline the comedy factory outlet, you know, so they would have him open the shows, you know, and he would look at my character like Italian rather than just a Brooklyn guy. And you know, you know, my real name's Andrew Clay Silverstein. And I went to Andrew dice clay, you know, so when like, you know, we won the same Rodney special, you know, and he, you know, he just got fucking jealous that my career went through the roof and, you know, and he didn't, you know. And the funny thing about that was, I might've even talked about this on your show that he would've been the perfect guy. You know, when I was doing the arenas, you know, to open those shows, you know, cause people did like, I'm on this special, but like I said, not everybody becomes a mega star. It just doesn't happen. Not everybody becomes the fucking Beatles. I'm sorry. You know? But he's a great comic. And because he had, you know, he started going on radio shows and say in my real last name. And I'm like, what's the problem? A, a Jew from Brooklyn can't be a tough good looking guys that the fucking problem, you know, unless I'm Italian.

Speaker 6:          01:03:29       Well, well the, the name clay, where'd that come? Well, that's just my middle name. Andrew Clay Silverstein. Oh, well my parents got it. So, uh, when you decided to just go as dice clay, why did you decide to do that? Andrew dice clay? Yeah. Why'd you seem was mean? I mean, you know what the original name was when I go on stage is, um, this was funny because when I, you know, my original act was like impressions. I'll just put it to you that way. You know, doing Travolta and Stallone and Jerry Lewis Travolta isn't Sam, you're Travolta is the best or vault on earth? No one, no one nails it. Well, the thing about Travolta is that, you know, he had those Brooklyn characters and it, you know, we were similar looking when I was 17 years old, you know, and I was just able to do them, you know, I was, I could turn it to Vinnie, Bob Marino, like, all right, so you asked me, uh, Vinnie, you know, where's your homework?

Speaker 6:          01:04:23       Vinnie? Where's your homework? What? That was the act. That was the whole thing. No, no, no words. You know, I did my homework book, but my dog ate it. I couldn't believe it. You know, and I would do all these Travolta it, but after the impressions, when I came to the comedy store, after I did, I got a shot on Don [inaudible] rock concert and I did that whole act, but now it was about the acting thing and I was thinking, well, nobody's going to buy me to do Travolta wrist alone. I got to develop my own stage persona. Do you know what kind of nuclear arsenal of a joke you have in your, in, in your wheel house, if you just did it with you doing an impression of Travolta and have some massage bit. Do you know with that impression how good that bit would be?

Speaker 6:          01:05:15       I know you don't want to do it and ad luck at of a courtesy to Travolta. I know you think he's very talented. You don't do jokes about him, but my God, what a fucking crushing bit you would have. Yeah. But I, I know what compression is really good. And then with the, the situation is so ridiculous. Him just wanting to get jerked off by all these guys, him saying, let me massage you. You're like, it's, the whole thing is great. I mean, it's right for comedy. I'm not hating the guy. I love him. Well, did you let him in the dig month? Thumbs into your neck? A little good. See you got a little crick, but I, you know what don't, why are you telling me? You telling me that you pretending to massage a guy and then stolen, then sliced says lowered. That feels pretty good.

Speaker 6:          01:06:07       No, I got a sense of humor about it. I just feel he's been through a lot. He's been through love, but he's also dished out a lot. He's one of our greatest stars, so I can't do it. He's, that's hilarious. He's a great actor, no doubt about it. But he's also a freak life getting jerked up by dude's. There's no question about that either. That seems to be a reoccurring theme and I ain't hating the guy, man. You should be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do. You know what it is? There's a lot of guys who were blown just cause he's, but that's what the, you know, the problem with women were maybe that's why he went to the guys I think just don't know how to jerk. I think he's a freak, you know what I mean? Is that it?

Speaker 6:          01:06:40       You try to teach them, you know what I mean? Some girls just seem to have uh, uh, born in ability to do it correctly, so girls just get it. Yeah. You know, squeeze hard. Alright folks telling me to say here. Your thing is my wife is squeeze harder. Going to hey, send us. I got the legs wrapped behind every years saddled down. Yeah. Look at him Mr. Date and not by the hair of Chinny Chin. Chin can get a date, you know, but no, I love Travolta. I let you know, I can only do impressions of, of, of the people in film that I really love. Right. It's too bad he can't do it. Well, I just didn't see it though. I gave you a little less time. I want to do it. That's it. Yeah. I mean, I could come up with it, trust me, but I got to leave the guy alone.

Speaker 6:          01:07:27       That's a beautiful thing. I would not leave him alone. Even if we were tight. Can we do Travolta? No, no. You do any impressions? I can do a couple. I want to see one of your shows now. I'm not even kidding. I'll, I'll send you my special. I'll gift it to you. I'll give the five bucks. I'm willing to pay. You know what I mean? You know, just, you know, I got a heart for people. That's what it is. I understand. You know? So even like when I rare, rare, like you were saying, you know what I mean? I don't know. I don't, I don't, I don't hate the guy. You know, they're, they're all guys I don't like, you know what I mean? Yeah. I mean, just don't like for many reasons. Right. His own, you know, jealousy would overcome him I guess, but he missed out on the greatest Gig in the world, you know, doing these arenas because he is an Italian from Philly.

Speaker 6:          01:08:14       I mean, I did the three times, you know what I mean? And he would have been great in those rooms. So I would book Lenny Clarke and Lenny Clarke wound up, I'll never forget, I did the universal amphitheater and then he calls me up and he goes, you know, can I have some people come to the show? And I'm going, Leonie, that's what it's all about. Like why wouldn't you be able to have people come to the show at 6,000 people, you know? Right. And he winds up, I don't know if you know Lenny clocks all great, but he, they gave him a sitcom. He got to sit down that night and that didn't work out. And he wound up on the Sitcom with, uh, what was it, a Frazier, you know, Frazier, I think. Yeah. Where he played a cop now, wasn't that he wasn't on the channel layer catch up, but didn't put it might've been that.

Speaker 6:          01:09:00       Well, you could look red pen to something. You're running the panel. Do the IMD for Lenny Clarke, by the way. Larry Clark. No, but Lenny Clarke wound up with a huge Korea. One of the funniest guy and it was nice to know, but I'm telling you, it was that night that it all came together for him. Lenny Clarke gave me some great fucking advice too. Like my second time ever getting paid to perform. I opened up for Lenny, this guy that I was working for, norm norm, the who was booking gigs in western Massachusetts or these little one night bars. Yeah, there's a place called js and Pittsfield, Massachusetts and I got to open up for lending. This is after Lenny had been on HBO and I got to go and my car, it was a funny moment because, uh, his brother has a great guy but still books a club called giggles and saw Mike Clark is the shit. He's just a great, great fucking guy. I never met him, but I know he's a Greg. He gives me advice. It's reputation. He's like power. You're pretty funny, but you're going to have to clean it up a little bit. Talking to the right ones. Dad, Madonna bit, you know, that one is just too much. I, you know, it was just saying like for his rooms, you know, like where I would work. But then when he comes off stage

Speaker 7:          01:10:07       kid that was fucking hilarious. Holy Shit. That fucking Madonna bid was fucking hot. Is

Speaker 6:          01:10:14       that heavy Boston accent and Mike's like, I just got told done telling them to stop doing that bit there cat cat show. It wasn't John Lennon here and she also did Lenny. I Lenny up lending, I should know that because it was next door to us when we were filming news radio. He was over there. He fucking, he said that John Lara QED guy was a Twat. He would just say how fucking horrendous it was to work with that guy. Yeah. But he took great. Yeah. Lenny was, Lenny was a top notch stand up like before he was buddies are all the guys that were on the Rodney special. So you had Lenny clock, you had uh, you know, they had to fill a spot. So he put Barry Sobel and now I saw, look Barry syllabub one point in time was pretty fucking funny. See, it was pretty fucking funny. He's a funny guy, but you know, when we did the Rodney special, you know how he was baseball jacket. So he shows up with a motorcycle jacket. All right? A blacklight and he's going on like a two before me. It was Lenny than

Speaker 4:          01:11:13       then Carol Lee for them, myself. Then Bill Hicks, uh, IRA and Bob Schimmel. And so he comes in wearing a motorcycle jacket and he goes, this is what I'm wearing on the show tonight. So I'm like, all right, another jerk off. Cause I didn't know him well, you know, and I go over to Rodney, I go look with the guys wearing Rodney. And Rodney goes, yeah, so what, you know, I go, well, he wants to wear it on the show. And then Rodney caught it. You know, he's gone, Barry, come in, man. You know what I mean? He goes, what are you going to wait on the show? And I'm standing right there. He goes, well, I'm going to wear this jacket. And Rodney goes, if you hit a jacket, man, you're not on the show. Okay, dice, where's the leather? You know? And of course Barry took out his little baseball jacket and that was the end of that.

Speaker 4:          01:11:59       Do you think he was trying to do it until like, you know what, you know when I prepared, you know, just like I'm talking about my special now, right. I'm really prepared, you know, I'm not going to do a half ass job when I'm up there and when that Rodney special, you know about, I had about six months to get ready for that and every night I'd go on at the comedy store. I wouldn't care if it was too fucking people in the crowd. I'm rehearsing, I'm rehearsing the act. That's it. Joke to joke to joke, you know Halloween, there's dom, I rare but just fucking around on stage and I'm like, these guys just don't get it. Because I knew when I would be in front of that camera that the only thing I needed to worry about was playing the people and the people at home.

Speaker 4:          01:12:44       I didn't want to think about the act. I want them to be on automatic pilot because your nerves get to you and you want to do the performance. Now, and these guys would just fuck around at the store. They wouldn't rehearse it, you know? And then they show up to do the special and everybody's nervous. And I'll never forget, I walked from the Regency Hotel, you know, I just want it to feel New York and I was in my outfit for the Rod and I'm wearing a belt buckle, you know this fucking big, you know the song. And I come walking into the club, I got the glasses on and Rodney goes, had he, he, he's like, how do you feel man? You know, Rodney, right? And I go tonight, they pay, they pay tonight. They get disciplined. And Rodney tonight, Dave, hey, okay man, you're ready tonight.

Speaker 4:          01:13:34       They're going to get disciplined. Did you hear that? And he just got such a kick out of it, you know? And when I went on, it was like, just kill them first show out of the box. I loved it. Or I need did that, that Rodney had those specials and introduce so many fucking comedian. Well, you know what, that's, if I do more as far as comedy specials, that's what I want to do. Now I want to put guys on that. I think a great go around the country, find the best know that's a great and deliver those guys to America. That's a great idea. You know, and you know, I spoke to showtime, they were into it. You know, it's, but first I gotta do this, you know, and really I think people are just to be fucking thrilled with this. You know, I was thrilled with the end result.

Speaker 4:          01:14:15       La Rocs just rocks the room, which was a little scary to me because when I saw the audience, you know, you know my boy just like, like comics now that you got, I think we used 18 cameras, you know, for the shoot. So you know, you know what I'm talking about. Just the pressure of, you know, deuce a director, all the people involved in the special. And you know, my kids came out, you know, Eleanor introduced them and they just rocked the room and the crowd went nuts because I'm worried that they're not going to let them get started. You know what I mean? And they just rock that. I'm so proud of them. And they're actually going to be at the whiskey on January 12th. So people that want to see a, a great band that's breaking La Rocs could go to the whiskey on the 12th of January.

Speaker 4:          01:15:03       It's always hard to get yourself into a normal performance mode when you're doing a special, you know, it's like, it's when all the, everything's riding on this one night, you've got two shows to get it right. Like sometimes the pressure can be overwhelming and you want to know something. I only wanted to do one. Uh, and you know, it was the people at showtime that was smart enough to go, no, you're doing too. You know, and they were right because I fucked up a few times in the first one. Yeah. It's, it's always hard to just, I wasn't nervous. I was, I was excited about it though. You know, it's the nervous excitement, you know, and then you get that first laugh and you just loosen up. Yeah. But I was just so prepared. I mean, like you said, you came to, uh, you know, uh, Vegas and saw the show and saw me working on it.

Speaker 4:          01:15:48       And you know, Vegas crowds aren't as great as crowds around the country, you know? And that's another thing I like. So it felt like the comedy store, you know, because in Vegas there's a lot of variables going on. This gambling, drinking, fighting with the check over, losing the fucking money. Now you were to show 10 at night, you know, and you're not even in the mood for that show. Yeah. You know, so the crowd, you'd never get that full amped up crowd that you would get. Like when you're on the road doing a concert, you know that they're just coming for the concert. So when I got to Chicago and you know, I hear the crowd before you even come on that doing the dice, dice, dice, I'm gone. All right, this is the real deal now. So yeah, I fucked up a couple of times in the first taping of it and you know, and then I got angry.

Speaker 4:          01:16:34       It became dice mean, you know, for the second show. And it just, I just delivered the way I knew I can. One of the things that helped me, and this is I think would help you to uh, doing a podcast helps you launch stage tremendously. You get so used to talking to people. You get so used to doing things like live that when we do, when I did these, uh, the special in, uh, Atlanta, I, I, there was the most natural I'd ever felt being on stage because the Tabernacle I had always had a problem with that we're like going on. When I was taping something, I'd be like Steph and tight and was just like never see. You

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       were really happy with the outcome of your performance. Forget it was 100%. How I always am a, it was 100% like you even said it while I was on stage. I was like, this is the most relaxed I've ever been doing. One of these things cause I didn't because she was so prepared, so prepared. I'd put a lot of lot of sets in to prepare, a lot of writing in to prepare. I had, I had all the material like completely down and but it was the, this, the audience is so fucking enthusiastic. It's like that's what it ate. Yeah. They're so fun and like, like I said, that's where we do parallel because we both draw crazy audiences. Yeah. You know people that are really out for the hardcore comedy, you know what I mean? So you really delivered it then. Well I am so happy that there's still guys out there that are doing anything controversial because I think this is such a strange time when it comes to comedy.

Speaker 1:          01:18:01       You know, there's been so many from the tosh thing too, the Tracy Morgan thing too, you know, just fill in the blank of every, any comedian that says anything. The Gilbert Godfrey thing, when he got in trouble for a lot of shit, it's like at a, at a certain point in time, it's like we're going to, if you keep going down this super ultra sensitive fucking stupid path yet, then there'll be no fun, no comedy. And by the way, you're just saying what you don't like. Okay. You're saying you don't like it. Well, fucking don't listen. It's really simple. If you're not into what a guy like Tracy Morgan would say, or a guy like you would say, well then don't fucking listen. No, no one's read it. Hiring you to, you can't tell me that it's bad. You can't tell me that it's real. You know, it's a joke. He's a fucking commit. That shouldn't be, you know, it's like I said, these comics are being put on trial. Right. You know, and um, you know, there's even a bit that, you know, I do where I use the fag word, but it's,

Speaker 4:          01:18:56       and the last thing I did it, I did a, an interview for a rolling stone like three weeks ago. And, you know, the guy asked me why I used the word fag, you know, and I said, well, did you listen to the whole? And, and he listened to the whole show, he watched the whole show. And I said, do you see where I go with the bit? What I'm really doing by the end of that bit? Is it sticking up for the gay community is what I'm doing it, it winds up about like, you know, when the guys were running, you know, try enough for president, whatever. And um, so it's about the whole marriage thing. You know, I don't, I don't want to do the bid on the end, you know, but that's what the bits about I go. And if I would say, you know, catch gay rather than catch fag, I go, fig is a funny word. You know what I mean? And for people that don't like it, well don't watch my shell, but it's funny and that's who I am on stage. But if you're going to talk about anything, talk about what the bit really, you know, turns into, you know, not,

Speaker 1:          01:19:57       not a word. Have you ever done anything, any year old material that you look back now and you're like, oh, I wouldn't do that today. I wouldn't say that. I really don't have many regrets on the, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       you know, I don't use too much of it in a special, I do a couple of classic bits. That's what I call them. You know, like today on a, I was on good morning La and you know, they played like some of this midget bit that I've done for years. But these are the new fans. So you'd give them some of the classic stuff you give them the, the mother goose. But other than that, you know, you know, 98% new act, you know, I've updated, you know, how I feel about different things. And you know, like I said, we're living in a different world. Technology, we're living in a world where, you know, women today a brought up on porn, you know, God forbid they don't have a, you know, a profile shot. It, I bleached out ass, hold on on the website or whatever.

Speaker 5:          01:20:48       They feel that not happening, you know, so, you know, so, so everything is new, but it's got that, you know, real heavy bite to it and it's got the anger that I like to bring to stage. I mean, I couldn't do it like you. I mean when, when I see you screaming up there, I had a couple of screaming he is but not as intense. Like that's what, that's what would make me sit down and watch you. I wanted to see how long can he scream, how long can he put that energy out? And you could back then you were gone like two hours you could do and just like, oh, he loves it. You know, it was almost like, it was, it was more about, it was almost like you're doing a verbal workout, you know what I mean? You know, it wasn't like, all right, I do a, B, c, d and I'm done. You would just go and I'm going kind of, and what is this guy taking to that? Anything like I'm watching you today, you know, um, you know, talk about like the different vitamins and everything that it's on and I'm gone. He's taken something that could really make a, I'm thinking maybe I should take some of those fucking vitamins because you could really go for a long time. Yeah. Volume.

Speaker 1:          01:21:58       It's not just about I'm taking vitamins. It's definitely about what you eat. It's really important. No, but I mean the energy, that's what I love because you know, when somebody is putting out that kind of energy, it's watchable. We didn't have, that's a good point that you brought up earlier. We didn't, uh, touch back on with the, uh, the idea that there's something wrong with you if you're moving around or like putting out a lot of effort. There was a time in comedy where guys like Dan and respect anybody who didn't just stand still and just say it with your words and it's like what you will, why would you lose like that performed? Like I would see a guy, like maybe Jim brewer is a good example, was really physical on stage. And, um, I would see like that the physical aspects of him moving around.

Speaker 1:          01:22:37       Was it really half? Yeah, half the belt and hilarious. And any comic that doesn't believe that isn't a real performer. Yeah. And when it comes for that, when it calls for that rather is nothing wrong with anybody. Just Pasal little, but it became a thing. Do you remember when it was like a thing amongst comedians that if you, you know, they like didn't respect guys who like put forth too much after when I came to the comedy still, because I had some, you know, at that time with the cassette tapes, I have my on tapes

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       Travolta and do it like I would do to grease lightning number. I felt like I felt like the, the Serpico of the comedy store because comics would go, you know, this is the music store and not the comedies and this is the comedy store and at the music store. And I got, because you can't do that. How does that sound? You know, you just can't do that and you don't look like this to do that. You're an ugly guy. You know what I mean? So you should be doing what you'd, oh, I had argument after argument with comics. I go, well, you know what the club on it thinks I am funny. Well, there's always, there's a weird thing amongst comedians when they want other comedians to be doing, they're kind of comedy. It's ridiculous. It's like a rapper going up to a guy who plays jazz and get mad at him for liking the fucking flute.

Speaker 6:          01:23:52       Yeah. But you know, I also feel what comics is, you know, not enough. I'm where we, I've told you that. I agree. Look, I agree. You know, I just don't feel they back each other up enough. That's why it's always good. Like when you came to my show, I was thrilled because he has another comic that I respect coming to see me perform. It's almost like, you know, you know Sinatra going to see Sammy Davis, so you know, like they back each other up with it. Yeah. It's very important to me. Uh, I think, uh, the, first of all, as I've gotten older and been doing standup longer and longer, the more I've appreciated the art form of it, you know, whether it's the style that you do or the style that even Seinfeld, I'm, I'm a, I'm a fan of any style of good. Like, so I love that.

Speaker 6:          01:24:35       I love Gaffigan Catholic and it's fucking hilarious. Very clean and like anybody can listen to it, you know, I love that style as wow. I just love the art form. So for me, comradery between other comics, like it's huge, huge, huge area. And put what I also like is, is this, I get a kick out of like the non comradery of the clean comics to guys like us. Yeah. Like they look at us, it's like, oh look who walked in, you know, with a clean guy. You know, and Seinfeld always had his little group of guys, which I think a hysterical him, Larry Miller, you know, pull rise a very clean, you know, to me the, you know, the, the all similar in this styles on stage. Well, I think Seinfeld was legit. That was legitimately him, but there was a lot of guys that came up that were like sort of what's legitimately him, but that that whole group had like a certain stuff like intimidating Larry Miller just kill fluence though.

Speaker 6:          01:25:31       What I'm saying is that there's a lot of guys that became Seinfeld, like there was a lot of very Seinfeld, like observational guys that I don't know if they would have been that way if it wasn't for Jerry because Jerry had a very specific style that a lot of those clean guys imitated that style really clearly and it's really no Seinfeld I love. I think he's just merely just kit kills me. I love him on TV. I mean acting. I mean I think he's one of the funniest guys ever. Did you ever see a stand up? Yeah, I've seen his standup. Yeah, I seen a long time. I saw some old old evening at the Improv was very, very close to sound the face and you know the way, you know, he's always shocked by things like that. Very bright guy too. That's why I don't like to hang out with him. He is, he's really smart and you don't like it? No, no, I love him. But you know, we've, we used to do like La Jolla together and everything

Speaker 5:          01:26:23       thing and you know, you know, there was a story where we did a private party and uh, you know, you know, and I, the guy offered me like $1,000 to do a birthday party, you know, in the hoyer and I, I go over to Larry and I said, we'll split the money you, you opened for me at the birthday party, you know, and uh, what's this big mansion? And I think this is the guy that invented a sex wax for a surfboard. Surfboards. And so we show up and I see a bunch of five year olds, you know, and I'm going, you know, I called a guy and I'm like, oh, you really going to have me do my act? And he goes, no, we got a clown for them. You'll for us. We are going inside. So it was all the adults. And Larry goes up and I'm laughing.

Speaker 5:          01:27:09       He does his act and now he's sitting, it was like a one of those living rooms, step down, living room. So he's sitting on the step and he's watching me and he's laughing hysterically, you know, and afterwards, you know, I, I'm asking him, I go, you see my act every night while you're laughing so hard. He goes, do you know what a stupid man you are? And I go, why? He goes, you were using a $20,000 veys as you an ashtray. I go, what did he taught? He goes to the big vase that was next to you. You didn't know where to put your cigarettes. So you putting them in this vase was bigger than me. And he goes, and I couldn't stop laughing because everybody was looking at each other. Every time he flicked a cigarette and this veys, he goes, you're a very stupid man. And it just, his delivery would just make me laugh, my balls off.

Speaker 6:          01:28:06       No, I love those guys. And I go, you know, Larry Miller was the guy that got me into comic strip when I started out. You know? And that's where it all started with the monologist. Yeah. You know, I've always hated that, that whole idea that there's like a good way to do comedy and then there's an easy way to do comedy because why is it that when I would go to see a guy like you or watch a guy like Joey Diaz, why is it that I laughed so hard? Like what are you telling me there's something wrong because it's balls out, but it is balls. I know, I understand. But why is anybody saying that there's something wrong with that? Like that's, there's a weird, you know, it's awesome. It's awesome the way you brought up, you know what I mean? Like these are very clean cut guys. Yeah. You know, and I love science. I liked them as a person. I liked him as a comic, but they will put, you know, these are guys that actually went to college. You know, I don't know how to talk to them. You know, the, you know, it's a different mindset education wise, and I didn't understand all that, but it's really, it's, it's a reservations. It's like they're, they're reserved and whereas

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       when you see someone like you or someone like Joey Diaz, it's saying something completely outrageous. They can't go with it. They can't just relax and go with it. They're restricted. They're there, they're pulled back. Is that what they think? Yeah, there's something, there's, they just can't cut loose that you can't be smart and enjoy good dirty joke. Well that's ridiculous then you're obviously not smart enough because you should be laughing at almost everything you could possibly laugh at. Well, you know what, let me see one of these fucking clean motherfuck is cell 300 arena shows and then I'll give it up for them. It's very hard to sell an arena, you know? I mean, I did it over 300 of those and nobody is ever going to top that ever 300 you know? And I did it without like, I don't even know, arena officially 14,000 how many thousands go anywhere from 15 to, you know, the biggest one I did was 21,500 and it was a 41 minutes sellout, almost the Brendan Byrne and Jersey.

Speaker 4:          01:29:57       And uh, I mean the La Forum, I sold out in a couple of hours from 21,000 fucking people pictures doing 100,000, you know, at the rose bowl with the being the middle act from Metallica and guns and roses. So what, what happens between doing these incredible arenas and then slowly sort of backing away from comedy a little bit. It was a slow thing though. I did the arenas for about six years, till around 95 and that's when it didn't go sour. I mean, you know, at that point, you know, the movie career was sort of nonexistent, you know, other than B movies because of the backlash and my stand up and the press. And so there were no big movies coming, you know, if the fort failing, you know. But even with the arenas, I would do cut down arenas like 10,000 seats tonight and that went on for a while, you know, then that will fight, you know, you d you know, in this day and you do 5,000 seats today.

Speaker 4:          01:30:59       That's unreal. That's a lot of, you know, I mean rock bands that, you know, it's a different time. It's a recession. It's just a different time. So, you know, when I see a comic doing 200015002000 seats, maybe 2,500 seats, that's superstar them for a comic. You know, I mean, think about it, 2000 people a night coming to see you is unreal. It's pretty weird. I just, you know, always had this thing in my head, you know, because I was so bad. Like I say, you know, my education was like nonexistent. I mean, school was just more of a place to go and hang out and play the drums twice a day, you know? And if it wasn't for the drums and music, I probably wouldn't have graduated high school because school just didn't interest me. You know? That's the bottom line. So, you know, I wasn't good in sports. Not that I wasn't a big, I just wasn't, I just wasn't good at it. And you know, but a time I was 12 years old, I was into all this stuff from doing impressions to playing drums too,

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       you know, that type of thing. And when I got into comedy and I saw the kind of guys you are talking about very straight monologists, you know, I just want them to be an actor and you know, use the comedy stage to develop my acting chops and, and the dice thing happen. So I decided, well, if I'm going to stay in this game and be a comic, I want to create the most visually exciting comic people have ever seen in the world, ever. You know? And honestly, you know, when you see the special, and I got great respect for you and what you do, but you're going to respect the special I because I respect that, you know, but, but I mean, you'll see what I mean because I deliver exactly what, you know, all these fans I've had through the years want to see from me.

Speaker 5:          01:32:47       And I like giving them what they want to see. I don't want to come up there all cleaned up with maybe, you know, not a tie, but you know, I was sport jacket and just black pants. I'm like, for what? You know what I mean? This is how I like to dress. Like, you know, I look good enough to dress in it, you know? So why not just deliver what they want to see and just pound them over to fucking heads with the filthy shit that I could come up with because we're living in the filthiest time with the filthiest fucking people. But yet the backlash is the strongest it's ever been. You know? But I don't care about the backlash anymore. Years ago I did because I didn't get it, you know, because guys came before me, everybody from, you know, Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, guys like some gone, what am I doing any different than them, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          01:33:36       And so now I'm at a point in my life where if you don't like me, who gives a fuck for you? You know, I don't give a fuck. If you see tomorrow, that's how I think about it. If a writer writes, if a journalist writes me up like a bad write up, I'm like, well what do I give a fuck? Do I notice the person, the white care, what they fucking feel? They're the ones writing me up. Well, and it's, it's not, it's never fair cost for them Joe. It's like, would a jazz critic review a hip hop concert? No. Why would they? It doesn't make any sense. So for someone to be, you know, a comedy critic, it's like wow, you know, there's a lot of different kinds of comedy. You know, he just because you have a specific taste, a personal taste doesn't mean the other competence I come from.

Speaker 5:          01:34:19       It's not for you. I come from, you know, like I said, like I like dealing with, you know, I love seeing the uncomfortability of people in the front row. I loved live performance and that's one of the fun. And if you're a clean up day, like, you know, I just don't think I would have any fun. I have fun like watching the guy and like I said, like Gaf again or watching the guy and like Seinfeld, but it's not the same kind of fun. Yeah. But you know, Seinfeld's one of a kind. Yeah. But it's not the same kind of fun. It's still not the same. She kind of fun is like watching a guy like you because Watson guy like you, you will say the most ridiculous shit ever. One of the things that I was howling is when I came back stairs, a backstage afterwards and I was talking to me about it.

Speaker 5:          01:35:00       Go then you're like, I don't do any research like we were talking about. How does that, yeah, it's just about the fucking lady. It was like how you were just like breaking down the whole process. I do no research. Well, I claim no responsibility. No response. If I was running for office, I'd have to do a little research for comedy. That's what I try to explain it. And that album, that data left the died dead. It's just about funny. Right? I don't care what it is, just be fucking funny. And I got my roles, like I won't, you know, bring up a disaster where people get killed. You know what I mean? We'll make fun of John Travolta. You have strong rules. Yeah, I do have strong rules and that way, you know, like what happened with the hurricane, there's no jokes for me when it comes to that stuff, you know, because you know, people are getting killed and there's families that are morning these people.

Speaker 5:          01:35:48       So it's like, where do I have the right to make fun of that, you know? So I try to stay away from that kind of stuff, but when it comes to sex, come on, it's just sex, so it's okay. Did you ever feel like at a time that you ever crossed the line though? It's like, did you ever say anything, whether it's about, uh, immigrants or gay people or anything when it comes to people, you know, like, you know, you know, when I make fun of Asians and call them China, man, you know, it's just funny. It's a funny word than Asian, you know what I mean? Chinaman Chink. It's all funny. You know? It's a great word. Well, if it was an angry Chinese dude though staring at you while you were talking about I do it right to, you know, I talk about fat girls and sometimes I got six in the front row and I'm gone.

Speaker 5:          01:36:32       All right, so how much does the fat girl, I talk about half the weight night because I've had some bees sitting fucking in front, so I'll have to double her. My wife says fat girls love me because I talk about them, but you know when I'm talking about a chick that to picket in the bed, I'm fucking around. You know? It's funny, you know, because no girl in the crowd is going to go, I'm not bigger than an eastern king. You know what I mean? They look at themselves like little cause I'm not looking to hurt him. I'm just looking to be funny, you know? And and let them laugh too. Fat Girls are allowed to laugh. They are. But dental particularly fucking blubber starts to jiggle and shit. They don't pretend to like fat girl jokes though, in my experience. Oh really? Yeah, I dunno.

Speaker 5:          01:37:15       Maybe it's just the way I deliver my crowds. They really like it. They're literally rolling in the fucking oil. You know? I've had a girl throw herself on the floor and start rolling around that. I'm looking like, this is hysterical. It happened once to speak. You know, I've had a heck of a fight with an 86 year old woman really, that I had to come into the middle of a crowd on a New Year's eve and just where was this big kiss? It was in San Antonio, Texas. God Damn. Yeah, and this 86 she was like, yeah, I know that. Not whatever part of America, I don't follow the map that much with the geographical shit, but it's not, but she sounded southern. You know what I man, Antonio,

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       Texas. Yeah. They have that Wang today and she's like, it was like one of those skinny, she was 86 or 80 [inaudible] slapping [inaudible] gone. You dirty mother fucker. You are a dirty. And she's as filthy as me, you know, that was one of my greatest heckle and, and it's something I didn't get on. I wasn't even filming. Babs, Holly Know 27 you know, and yeah, I've had some great heckle fights in the days where, where they would actually look to throw lines at you, you know, rather than just being drunk. Are you fucking suck? Well, especially on what do you do with that for the store or some of the worst places ever, you know, for Hecklin the first of all because there's no crowd control and second of all, because Hollywood is always filled with people that are unhappy. They, most people are not achieving their dreams here.

Speaker 6:          01:38:47       The majority of people are struggling. Sale. Yeah, the majority. And you've got a lot of like want to be actors, want to be musicians, want to. If you're at the comedy store and go, well what are you doing? Well I'm an actor. Okay, good for you. But that guy could wind up a superstar. The place it's, look, it is possible, but fun to Piss on it. There's a lot of that bitterness that's in the air and there's a lot of that in the crowd. It was one of the reasons why it's such a good place to work out because that was not an impressed audience. They were not impressed with you

Speaker 2:          01:39:14       the other day by a guy in a wheelchair and he comes there I guess once in a while, but he can't talk or move. Like he has like one of those where he just has like a thousand computers and cell phones in front of them and they put him right in the front and he, wait a minute, he has cell phones and computers, everything but like a fax machine. His hands work like his hand. One Hand works to move on one hand it's just pushing iPad buttons and stuff and doing things. But he talks through that. He, I, he doesn't really talk, he just goes like that. And so while you're on stage they put them right in the front row to the whole show is just don't know. But then he can, he'll say something that that means like non stuff like that. And he's just fucking saying these horrible things the whole time. And then he's like that. He's a track. Right. Wow. He wants you to blow him. But, but no, he's like he's just fucking with you. And he just fucks with every single comic and he sits there from like uh, it's like seven o'clock or whatever that, that, that open mic show all the way to like come out. I don't know. It drives everybody. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:40:14       Yeah cause it, that's a club like to work the new stuff. And it always sucks when you have a guy that you just have to handle rather than working material. Yeah. Well the other problem is when someone before you doesn't deal with the Hackler and then you got to go up and then it's already out of control cause they already feel like that's a part of the show and they like continue the bullshit. Well and also, let's be honest, at the comedy store, there's a lot of fucking people that, that they just, for whatever reason they're still doing standup, but they checked out a long time ago and showed us sort of going through the motions and it's not very good material. And for whatever reason, they don't have any talent for whatever reason. And you'll see them go on stage and then these hackers started eating them and then

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       you have to go up and back, clean up, clean up on aisle nine. You know, Christ

Speaker 4:          01:40:59       do go on. I always make like there's nobody on before me, you know, and just start from zero. I don't care if somebody had a fight with somebody in the crowd. I'm not going up there to like, like it's like you're saying like just one comic, you know, like the whole, the whole lineup is one comic, you know, getting into it with this one person, you know, I just start from zero and if somebody says something dice mean comes out and hopefully I handle it right there. And then the comedy store was the best workout for that place. It's just, it's the greatest, you know, I've gone through a lot of stuff. You know, I used to get to open Fetty Murphy there all the time. Mitzi would use me to know to go on after him cause nobody wants to go on after him. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:41:42       You know and that, you know, those kinds of things that like an honor at that time, you know, and you know that's how you got to meet some of those guys. Like you know, and Murphy was always like, and I didn't understand it at the time when he would be like nervous to go out there like on a Monday night in the main room and I go, what are you nervous about that all he a feel, you know, I didn't get it because once you have that fame, now you have to live up to it. And I did not, I was just excited about going on after the guy, you know, I got to follow prior at the store after the burn incident and everybody was coming to see him. I mean you had Sammy Davis sitting on the floor with his legs folded. You had Burt Reynolds, there was Sally fields, you had to narrow their with Scorsese and I will come up there like I was playing a bowling alley and just go into it and just make sure I kicked their ass every time. Mitzi putting you on after a strong acts was a big move for everybody. Big Move for me and one of the guys that I had to I you a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:42:43       I followed you a lot in the early days. Like in the 94 ish. Wow. When I first started coming there, she would throw me on FTU I filed prior cause you need to follow an animal and not only that, it's a, it's good for you to go on after someone strong because you realize you can't have any fluff in your attic and know many bullshit. You've got to cut right to the funny stuff. You've got to, you impress them right away, get them right off the bat, hold onto them. You know, it was like, it's a good exercise in learning. Like especially when they love the guy before, like you would be up fucking destroy and then some unknown person has to go on after you. That's what she, that's where Mitzi makes it. Yes. She picked the right guy for that and Martin Lawrence, I used to go and have to go on and after him a lot. I never followed mark. Martin was in his prime. I'll tell you, Martin did not have as long a prime is a lot of people did for whatever reason. And he got into movies and it kind of doesn't do as much special and I love him. He's like one of my all time fucking hilarious and all my God, he destroyed the main room at the inn. At the comedy store ones. Yeah, just leveled the place and I had to go on after him because he was just funny. Just look at him as funny,

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       you know what I mean? And he knew it and he play off of it, you know, he's one of my favorites. I mean I felt like a rank amateur when I had to go on after him also because especially if it's one of those nights in the main room with that guy, his audience, and he's talking on stage. Most people got up and left. It was, it was only like maybe 20% of the people stayed and even them I was just like this and he's out there now. He's doing consciously doing it again. He is. I mean, I don't know how big it is. I Dunno, you know the schedule but, but I know he was at the store really work and stuff. Well that's great. I hope he can bring it back to form. He was when he was on top of it. You know what he's, he's great.

Speaker 4:          01:44:30       He's great in the movies. I love him. I love Eddie Murphy, you know, as far as you know, raw comics go. But Martin, I always loved him the best because it was his actions on state and he's a guy that knew how to play the stage. He'd be all over the place. I mean I loved his first special, you know. What was your first years at the store? What year was it? I came out this still, it was, it was the beginning of 79 February 79 fucking seventies holy shit. And you guys were living in that house on your ass arrest till I almost bought that place. Couldn't have a big enough yard for the dogs though. I think there is no yard. There's no yard off the mountain. I looked at it and I was living in that house. That house was crazy house. You got some fucking history to it.

Speaker 4:          01:45:15       Yeah. That's a crazy house. That's the only reason why I was thinking about it. I was like, this is such a historic, everybody, you know, Robin used to come up there all the time, you know, some of the bigger name and I wouldn't even talk to these guys. I would never talk to a big name celebrity unless they would talk to me, you know? And uh, cause I know what the thinking, the minute you say hello, what movie you're doing and what's my part right. You know, I would never bother even when Robin would come up to the house. So was like, just stay away, you know, and uh, I mean great talent, but I wouldn't look to get in his face and go, well I'm doing this. And I used to have to follow him to it. The store. Well you knew intuitively that it would be annoying as fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:45:55       That's what gets me when I go there. You know, these guys, you know the cross the boundary a lot of times, you know, and then they want, you know, it starts with the pictures and you know, I'm a comic and you know, they want to be buddy buddy in once and I can't, you know, I don't work that way. Yeah. Some guy hit me with a fucking a sales pitch the other day after a show. We just cool, I'm down from the show but I was taking photos with this whole line of people and this guy just starts rattling off the sales pitch and just, I mean it's going on for several minutes and I'm just supposed to listen and I just can't start out the patient and after a while I go do it. Stop. I can't do that. Stop. I don't have any time for anything and I'm definitely not going to go into business with you. I don't even know you. This is crazy. But the sales pitch was just ready go. Like this is opportunity. But that's also what, you know, like directed energy. It's what the new generationZ , that's what gets me like, you know when you grow up and all you're is looking down at

Speaker 5:          01:46:49       your phone, you know when it finally you hit that age where you have to start communicating face to face with people. They don't know how to do it. You've got to shake someone's hand. It's like shaking a fucking limp. Fucking Dick. You know? They don't even know how to give a firm grip. Know what the fuck is that about? What is that about? No, but I'm serious. That says something about somebody's character. Well, you know, if you can say, yeah, how you doing? You know, and it's like, I'm like, what is that? It's for a lot of people, it's not no people skills. I'm telling you, they don't want to be manly. I can't handle it. It's not about the men. They just don't know how to relate to you unless the texting to you or emailing to you. They just don't know how to have conversation. You know?

Speaker 1:          01:47:33       There's definitely a lot of that going on. This is, there's a lot of people that are growing up in a society that is more and more encouraging people to control themselves and to calm themselves down and to not have as much fun and to be more conscious of how other people are going to view things and be more sensitive. Personality in school, they want to put them on Rhydlin. Yeah, I mean it's the crate. They want kids sitting like mute and they want to pretend that school is interesting. It's not interesting like the whole policy of breaking a child down, getting them to sit in position and absorb information that they don't find attractive. That whole policy is conditioning someone to just listen and be a fucking drone. That's what it is. It's not the best way to learn by far by any stretch of the imagination. A best way to learn would be some sort of a one on one instruction where you know you get to explain to them things over and over again and you get to answer all questions. I was saying

Speaker 5:          01:48:28       when we went to school, at least you could have a personality in that classroom today. If you're not just quiet and sitting there like you're saying, you know you're not a

Speaker 1:          01:48:38       good students. That's Matt and sit this, the quiet and sitting there as the madness, the ability to just sit there. I remember when I was a little kid and they would want me to sit down. You'd be all of a sudden like you're listening to something that's not fun at all after you've just gotten done running around with your friends

Speaker 5:          01:48:52       and I, I wonder what even goes on now cause to the phones and the iPads and all the shit they bring to school now. You know. Does that even, you know, do your kids tell you what that stuff,

Speaker 1:          01:49:03       I'm sure they're listening to music in class with her head. Let's go. It must drive. The teacher's fucking bizarre. It must the end. You know what this is? Just wait til they got those fucking Google glasses and you know the of these glasses that they're coming out with it. You were and you, you're seeing things in the glasses like emails and you can get a website. Yeah, it's good. Especially with glasses like yours. Nice big ones. This is a bigger screen, but you'll see any, see all your shit up there. You can see all your photos. You can be fucking you flipping through them by using your finger in the air. I'm not joking. No, but it's fun. It's crazy. Sitting in class like this. You are literally, you'll be able to do that and do that in front of your eyes and make them move and you'll be able to pick ones and stretch them. Going to deal with

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       that shit. They're not, they're going to have to have rules. Yeah, with that shit. It'll be a called a like a no touch interface. It'll all be like finger movements. You just be doing things with your finger. It's going to be fucking insane. And that's just the beginning, you know? Let's see. It's going to keep going further and further until you get something implanted into your fucking eyeball. They have contact lenses to now to do it. Uh, you know, that's enough for me. I don't believe in context. They never did. But the contact lenses that allow you to see contacts, not at all, nothing. Why? I just don't believe in them. But you believe in glasses. Do you have like a lasix issue? Could you go do not? No, you wouldn't do it. I'm just nearsighted. Oh, okay. You know, so I try to weigh at like sunglasses that people could see through.

Speaker 6:          01:50:31       You know, there the, you could see me good, right? Yeah. Um, do you, so near side it means things that are close to you. You have a hard time. Things that like kind of far away. Oh, so you see things close? Fine. Yeah. But things are, hmm. I thought that was, and when you're farsighted, that's where you can see things right here. That's me, man. Yeah, I'm chat. Do you wear glasses? No, it's not that bad. I mean I can like, I can read my shit this special. No, it can't be a dentist classes. Right? Like he can actually like still look at his phone. I can look at my phone when you're talking about, you're exaggerating. It's not big. I stopped doing that. You put out, are you going to tell her? She knows. She knows. You know what I'm doing right now. I'm writing to see if I'm any good at this part.

Speaker 6:          01:51:15       Right in the gang in new you totally would be good. That's what I was saying before and she told me to do a podcast because I don't like, I'm not going to be, that's good. That's good. That's even better. That's even more fun. But I don't want to just shred people. You don't have to. I'll have a podcast for three weeks. I don't want to be on there. When you and I talk, we don't shred each other. You know each other. Yeah. But I'm saying it wouldn't automatically be you not liking the people years assuming that I don't think it's necessary because I don't get along with a lot of, and that's in real life on stage. Well, you and I have always gotten along and I think it had a big part of it had to be that I was a huge fan when I was a kid.

Speaker 6:          01:51:51       I remember I was having, but it's like you brought up last time about the first time we talked, because you know I was starting to know your history a little with the TV show and stuff and that's why it spoke to you about the road. You know, I was like, you don't go on the road, you have a sitcom on the Yale. Like what are you waiting for? You know? And that's, I think that's when you really started going out there. Yeah, it was really good. What's my cost to me. But it was natural. It was very good advice and I didn't even think about it. And also I was just assuming that I would always have a sitcom role, which is really dumb because like why would you assume that the end he, those things never last. You know? And it lasted for five fires, but, but once I started going on the road, that's when my standup really got a lot better.

Speaker 6:          01:52:30       That's the one thing I could tell with you when you were on stage as you love it. See, that's the key. And you never lost that love for it. It's the most fun thing about the special. No, it's fun. It's still fun. It's too fun. Oh, you're going to tour a lot now with them trying to write a lot of new shit right now. So I've got to at least 40 new minutes of new stuff and then a gang of stuff in the notebook that I have to sit and write it go on stage. I do both. I do a lot of making up on stage. A lot of shit like I'll go on to, you don't have an idea, you know? But there's a lot of it that I actually sit in front of a computer. Right. I think to get the best results.

Speaker 6:          01:53:03       I like both. I like actual writing, sitting down, writing things out and then I like performing and living. I just think that when you take a lot of time, when you sit in front of a computer, taking a lot of time, you're going to come up with more possibilities than you will in the moment. You know? Like in the moment is great too. But I think it's done an eave or even an either or thing rather. I think for Comedians, I think it's important to both, right? Like to sit down and actually work on your shit by yourself and to do it on stage and just ad Lib and fuck around. That's how I have the best results. That's always tail. Like young guys, they say, what should I like to write on stage? I'm like, keep doing that. Definitely keep writing on stage. But you should also write, you should also sit down and write because you get the most out of it.

Speaker 6:          01:53:48       I only do it on stage, only on square rock. I'll come up with stuff. Not that I'm a genius with it, you know, it doesn't happen every night. So you have you ever sit down with like a notebook or anything? And what I love is, you know, uh, you know that I finally, you know, to give her a little credit, she doesn't want to be on the air or anything, but she'll tail it the bit. Like if I come up with something and it goes a little too long, she'll explain why it's got to be, she really gets it, you know, and I'll show it in the bid up and I'll be on stage and I'll kill with it. I'll be like, how the fuck does she know? You know, cause she, she wants anything but the limelight, you know what I mean? And it's like she just gets it, you know, she'll go, you don't understand.

Speaker 6:          01:54:31       Once you hit this point you don't have to go farther with, that's it. That's the Joe and that they're, you know, and because of a Latin background it's like all right, I'll end it there. But she's normally right. 99% of the time it'll be killer. It's a funny thing with stand up comedy, like you know, you never know like where the bits going to go when you first started and you start adding on to it. And my attitude like I would never listen to anybody about what I do on stage, especially in non comic and she's not a comedian. You know, it would be like, look, when I'm on stage, do me a favor, stay out of it. You know, I didn't become who I am because I was listening to my girlfriends, you know what I mean? But she really gets it and every time she comes up with something and I do it, it kills. I know a lot of comics like to work with the people. They like to like a, I know like Chris Rock, when he would do a special, he would work with a team of guys, Dawson, Nick Depalo and they would come up with the bits and you know, work on it together. The Palos, a good comic. Yeah. But I don't, I don't think any comic, that's a really great car. And I think the polyps great. Yeah. But I don't think he's going to look to write better rock than he

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       has for somebody else. It's true. It's just in your head. You're not going to, if you come up with something fantastic way, the writing, you know what, I'm going to put this on the side for me. I'll give credit. That's why I also believe in being an original. Like you know, it comes from you. Yeah. I think that's important. You know, when I hear that a guy had a bunch of writers helping with Watson of special, it's just, you know, with them and see it thing when, when he was stealing it, you know that guy was stealing material. But I'm talking about when others are writing at field. It's like how it doesn't feel organic coming doesn't, but I don't care. That doesn't bother me. I don't think that a musician should have to sing his own songs that he wrote. I don't think that a comic should have to tell.

Speaker 5:          01:56:26       I think if one of your friends right to joke for you, you should be able to do it on stage and it feels actually comes up with great stuff for me. It doesn't really. Yeah. And there's nothing wrong with dad, but I, but I feel like he knows me so well if I'm doing like a bit on the heavy box, you know what I mean? You know, first you know the bull monkey, whatever the fuck they want it today. You know, like I'll just call him up and I'll start coming up with stuff and he'll just add these things and I go, why don't you do that for you? Right. Cause he's such a peculiar character. He's a very, definitely when it comes up with something for me, you know, I'll just like do it and kill with it. It could just be, well he did get me banned from one TV show here.

Speaker 5:          01:57:10       Wheels did. Cause I listened to him. There's something wrong with me. Like heels, wheels tried to tell me that. It was like a cool, you know what he's doing? He's got an entertainment company, blue light into Taman. He's got a catering company. I heard his food's very good. It is. That's what's so nuts. Some of it at the comedy store, way back Cagnoli kids, he'll love that I'm saying this to you know, but, but he really, like, I went a couple of years ago and I had to do another morning show, you know, and I was getting heavy into the technology stuff about the phones, this and that. So as I'm driving there, he's talking to me. He goes, all I want you to say if you bring up technology is that you don't have a blackberry and the only thing you want black is laying underneath you and it's got a big fat ass and the only thing you want buried is your face in it that your blackberry, you know.

Speaker 5:          01:58:05       So I do it just the way he tells me to do it. And you could feel the ass stop and it's eight in the morning to Los Angeles. I'm going, yeah, I don't believe in the phone thing. You know, I don't like those blackberries. The only thing I want black is normally underneath me with a big fat ass and the only thing buried, it's my face in it and then it's just quiet in the studio and you felt it, you know? And you know, of course my publicist was told he could never be on the show again. Does that's even nobody the fuck did they think they were going to get if they're bringing it Clarius. But I was just so into the joke driving there, Dan, I didn't think it was that bad. I'm going, well I'm not cursing. You know, and they yeah, it's not that.

Speaker 5:          01:58:51       No it's you, it's Andrew dice clay at eight in the morning when when people are shaving and getting ready for work, you know, as a black woman on screen with me right next to me, they're looking like, what the fuck is this? So, so today when I did this other, you know, Fox News, I, I was nice. You worry about them a sabotaging you or sending you up or you know, like ready to, you know, those kinds of shows that were always very cool with me. So I always felt bad about the blackberry joke cause I wasn't looking to offend anybody. I was just looking to be funny, you know, and, and to me it was a funny Joe. They should and we'll show me to say it, which they should ban him. They should understand first of all, that you're a dirty comedian. You've always been putting shit up.

Speaker 5:          01:59:35       Shocked by that. But I'm also an adult that shouldn't be listening to my friend, you know, telling me to do this joke on the way Lou radio stuff. The TV station and seeing it being your fault. I think people are too fucked. I think it's wheels fault. I think we could blame really also if you would like, but he had read the plain, the newspeople. I remember that time when you want CNN. Well that guy had a comment that was ridiculous, but it was great. That was also a good viral video for you because, uh, people like it was clear, you know, that it didn't make any sense of this kind of saying that you like, you ran a gym for a while. Well, I just did a, another CNN thing that'll layer on a Saturday that actually, uh, uh, Alan Duke was the interview. Uh, and Tom Green produced it.

Speaker 5:          02:00:20       Tom Green, the comedian. Yeah. Oh yeah. He uh, he had, we did a two camera shoot for this interview. Oh, he's great. And I can't believe how it's him. You know, me, I'm always doing the filming and he's holding this heavy cameras and he's, he just becomes a filmmaker at that point. You know, he's really great. I'm good friends with Tom. I love triggering. He's phenomenal. Phenomenal. Got To get them back in here, Brian. Yeah. Yeah. Me and Tommy Gee, that's is a good dentist. Tough guy named Tommy g. So you guys did another, who was the guy that did the original interview with you? The one where you know, the dumb guy, you know, the guy that interviewed me was basically saying that guys like, you know, that was it. You know that guy made a mistake. He paid the price and uh, that was it because he is a CNN reporter that had no facts about it. That the dot. Here it is right here. Yeah. That turned this on

Speaker 8:          02:01:13       for a while. For a while. You were actually, you were running a Jim, tell us about that. Hunting and Jim, why don't you running a gym at some point? Be a news guy. What you get no fats are, we come on CNN and the, I don't even know what he's talking about. Go ahead. You Ain't no point where you're running a gym. No, no. Running a gym. Jesus fucking Christ had come on the news for two seconds and he wants, see every time I do an interview with a guy wants to open his fucking man. All right Andrew. A little thank you. Fuck yourself. Listen to the snow. Goes back to talking about art Carney fill. You went on the art Carney situation. Where did that go? That's

Speaker 5:          02:02:00       it. You know any Korea he might've had is over. Yeah. How could you just ask someone and say that your research shows the own? Did you, there was the Internet back then. What you want to know something? What was crazy is and the guy knew it that the next night I was at the beacon theater and it was oversold. It was gone. Why was he trying to pretend that you, uh, you know, that, you know man away from stand up and that you had weren't, weren't doing it and we're running a gym, but why was he the way I would put it? I go his mom, he probably didn't like me, you know, so he was like going to get me fuck this little cock sucker. Wonder whether they know he is right now. I'd like to touch point. Oh, here he is. He's not delivering newspapers.

Speaker 5:          02:02:40       That's where he is. I know for sure it'd be a real good Taj point is that guy's name. I don't even know his name. I know you are. Are you friends with Taj? I don't know him. I don't know. I watched the show with very good guy. Very funny guy too. But that would be an interesting thing. Yeah. We're gonna need to find out homeboy's name. W The internet will tell us, hey, on Twitter, who's that guy was that fucking guy and where is he? All right. What's he doing? See if we can get them, look at it. Look how focused he is. Maybe he would be a good guy to interview. Uh, and you could play that. You have a son together. Yeah. That would be too intimidating for them. Give a chance for him to apologize. He wouldn't do it. He'd be sad.

Speaker 5:          02:03:17       He'd be sad face. I forgot how many millions of hits that though. I'm sure it did. I watched it at least 20 you know, I love it. I love it. Yeah, it was great because you know, when you're doing, especially CNN, which is, you know, is aren't they the top news show in the world? How don't you have some facts, right? I mean, you, you have way more facts than this guy have a head, you know, and you're a comedian. Well, he was, what he was doing was just sort of judging you as a joke, you know, he was like, well, I'm hearing or doing an interview with some, you know, like his thing paid the price. It wasn't that he, he was diminishing or you, you, you were, you were a headline guy, line guy for a while. You popped out and now you're coming back for a while.

Speaker 5:          02:04:07       For a while. You were actually, you were running. And Sam, tell us about that. That I never understood running a gym. Everybody wants to think that just you have to have all of your information. You have to have all your ducks in a row and your facts check to be on television. And that's just not the case. Like you could get on one of those shows and never dickless opinions and then they fucking fire you. I mean, it's happened a million times before this guy really paid. I think he disappeared, but he probably sucked anyway. I mean that, that was a shitty interview.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       Like why would he talk to you like that?

Speaker 5:          02:04:40       Because he's an asshole because he didn't do any fact checking because, because like I said, he, you could tell this isn't a guy that would be into two days also. But even if you're not, don't these guys talk to everybody?

Speaker 1:          02:04:54       Yeah, he has a, it's that fake. We're talking, you know, that sort of fake on television way of talking.

Speaker 5:          02:05:00       Oh, when he came out and I could tell something was up because you know, I was trying to like, you know, a little pre, not a pre interview, but you know how you doing what's called before you sit down and talk. And he was like ignoring me, you know? And I was actually there with, with Eleanor and happy face. He was ignoring you because he didn't want to talk to you. And I could just, I can just fit. No, there were no cameras on us. But what, he didn't want to talk to you until the camera's on maybe. Yeah. Like, like how don't you, even when you do a talk show that come over to you for a few minutes, you know the host before you go on, this guy didn't even want to talk. And um, I wish, I don't know what was here to tell the story because when, when you're sitting there doing the interview behind you, you know, it's in New York and it's just the full floor of people with computers on the desk. So Eleanor said when you first cursed, she goes, you're talking about a couple hundred people on this floor with computers. Everything stopped. And they all just looked up at the computer and then it continued. And then everybody like lean forward to go, is this really airing right now? Like they couldn't believe it was airing and then we just like ran out of there and gotten a cab. Like we were like, we just robbed the bank. Well, CNN is not broadcast television,

Speaker 1:          02:06:21       so CNN is not held to the same restrictions that the FCC imposes on NBC or CBS or ABC. That's not a cable. So when you're on cable you can say, Shit, we can say whatever you want. It's up to whether or not your advertisers are willing to still support you while you do that. So you aren't breaking any laws. But if you had done that on like ABC Nightline news or something like that, then you would have broken a law and then then shit. If they've found you like that you did it willingly. Me You'd slip up. I, I just fucking got, oh sorry. You know you could have one of those situations but if you clearly like like this fucking asshole over here and you know clearly like that today I think is like that's a serious fine. I think that's like a quarter million dollars and I think you can to the person saying, yeah, you can get in a lot of trauma.

Speaker 1:          02:07:04       I got to remember that. But the way you did it on a CNN, on heater, our net, I believe that's his name. When you did it on CNN though. That was, it was like, just do one on Hbo. It's like the same thing. Really. This guy probably just sits there all day and go, everybody has seen this. Just everybody has seen another half a million are going to say it. Now look, it's silly. Fox. The road can pot. It's very funny when you have a guy like that. Those guys, they kill me. Those buttoned up guys. That's not him. That is not the

Speaker 6:          02:07:35       guy. That's what he turned into with gained 150 pounds, started a slumping fucking jerk off. He's still a jerk off for doing that. Well, maybe he feels bad and he's not anymore. No, never forget. Never Forget. It feels bad. Probably not. Gretz is that that happened? That's all. Yeah. Well am I see evolve. Maybe when a mushroom trip somewhere maybe we went down to Peru cause brain cleaned out. It's possible. I don't like him. I don't want to, I don't want to get a fine. No, you don't get to find on the Internet you that you can do whatever the fuck you want. That's why I love this show. It's so relaxed to you if you're having a good time here so far. Yeah. Mrs Dice Clay, Mrs dice climb in the back of his uncle on the air. Yeah. It's cool that you guys uh, have this like happy touring thing too.

Speaker 6:          02:08:27       Like you guys are happy together in Vegas having a good time. Like you bring your family out, you have your kids open for you, Ellen noise, your friend. She's there. Like you have like a nice happy little group. Yeah, it's Nice, you know, to sister wives, the whole thing. I like how you did it in Vegas too because I'd always wondered whether or not somebody who even know what day it is. Like a workout room. No, I love that. But now I'm actually moving to the hard rock in Vegas and, well, yeah, but what I meant was like, I always wondered like if you went to Vegas, like would you have to have the same act over and over again or could you use, you're the first guy that I heard of, they like used Vegas, like you said, like the store just go in there, but it's a tourist town.

Speaker 6:          02:09:04       So every week you've got a different audience, different convention. I don't know what you don't do it more. You were right. I should, I probably should. So many comics are moving. They're living there, you know. Well, I'm doing it in February. I'm a, I'm at the Mandalay Bay, the big room, uh, on, uh, February 1st, and it's the day before the UFC. It's basically the same. They kind of liked that. I've done that room toe. It's where it, yeah, but I can't sell that many tickets. So they, they cut it in half and then even cut in half is 802, you know, it's 800 seats cut. I know the room. I've done it a lot. No, it's one that, no, the room is like 1600 16,000 you mean? No, which one I'm talking about in the Mandalay Bay, they got a big showroom. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. They're doing it in the event center where the fights, it's where they have the fight.

Speaker 6:          02:09:51       Oh, you're doing it now. They cut off half the room to do the way it's actually not even half the room. It's more like a third of the room, so I think it's like close to 4,000 yeah. But you know, you get a tremendous following. Yeah. No, no, no. It's, it's, it's a great place. But I'm saying that that's what I usually do. I only do like, what would you be happy now? 1,000 people showing up for you? Yeah, we've done that before. I've done that a couple of times. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah. We just want to make sure it's fun. Alan, Sharon office, his name Alan Shernoff. Oh, there's an Allen. He sits on the board as an advisor for a, hold on. I'll tell you right now. It sits on the of the deadline club

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       is a career advisor for Brown University.

Speaker 6:          02:10:38       Anything put in front of a county? Well that's a, that's a strange gig. I hope he's happy. What's the name again?

Speaker 2:          02:10:45       Allen. A. L. L. A. N share NOFX. C. H. E. R. N. Oh,

Speaker 6:          02:10:50       f. F is he on? You never got me down. Never got me down. I'm still standing island. Do you know Doug? Stan hope is friends with the real Jake Lamata. I love Doug. Stan hope. Doug Stanhope lives in Bisbee, Arizona Sodas. Jake Lamata and Jake Lamata comes over his house and plays poker. That's where I was photos of the two of them together. But stay in hope himself as a sterile. We did a show at the Wilton together last Friday, the end of the Mayan calendar show. And uh, it was, uh, Stan Hope Diaz me in a band. It was really fun. It's pretty crazy. That's a good show. So yeah, it was fun. Yeah, it was the, what's the band, honey? Honey, they're friends of ours. They'd been in the Holocaust a few times. Really, really talented band. They're like almost like kind of countryish kinda like rockish country. Like they play a lot of Banjos and shit.

Speaker 6:          02:11:39       The girl has a tremendous voice, guys, a great songwriter, great musician, really cool people too. So they opened up the show. They did like four, four songs. Then Diaz went out and like he's doing great. Ah. Couldn't be doing better. Yeah. He's killing him everywhere. He didn't want a podcast though, right? Oh yeah. Church of what's happening now. But he's also, I think he might even be there now where I play at the river. Ah, stall. Like the, they're talking to him about doing something. I don't know whether or not he's decided whether or not he was going to do it. I think he was trying to make up his mind whether or not he was going to do that or not. But um, I think it's a great idea for him because it's a quick flight, 40 minute flight lives in Burbank. It's, you know what, it's the best gig right now in the country for comic.

Speaker 6:          02:12:19       You, you know, you make it sound very appealing. I just, the idea of like living in Vegas, but you don't have to live there, you know, you could just go, you just want to see, we drive it all the time. We don't even fly. Yeah. Yeah. We'll drive it, you know, and it's become so regular dry for us. It doesn't feel like a long time. You know, we do it in four hours. That's the best tip. Like what's the best time to go? Do you have any tips to drive when you drive in there? But anywhere between 12 and one I am in the morning, in the afternoon. You fuck afternoon, get it wrong twice. If I'm home at night a lot, you know, we'll get home like five in the morning and getting stuck on that drives. I've been stuck on that drive. I stopped. No, but I could go away when everybody's, you know, at work. So, um, the, going to the hard rock that, um, is it in the new wing? You know, there's a, all those, uh, those new, no, no, no. It's weird. It's right near where the joint is. You know, it's, it's when you first come in, like you go to your right, it's right in that area. I know exactly where it is. I said there was a band there when I was there. Yeah. Well that room, the vinyl is, is a rock and roll room where they put like new

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       rock bands. That's perfect view. How many seats, you know, well it'll seat about 400 and you do that once a month, you know? Yeah, I'll do it like two weekends out of the month, you know, two, four day weekends. So we spend like a week and a half day and then we come home. I gotta start doing something like that. I'm telling you is trying to do in January 9th and trying to find a room for AVN. I went to a comedy show. There was Sam Aaa, but I have no idea. You could use a, the laugh factory that, uh, how bays, we'll just open the, there's a last right, right in the Tropicana really? Cause it Jamie massage connected and it's the laugh factory and uh, how everything, you know how everybody's all right? No, no, he doesn't. And I have friends with Bazell tone. He's not. Do you know who he is?

Speaker 5:          02:14:13       Yeah, he's a calm. I really don't know him actually open for Rodney for like 20 years. And uh, so they just opened this club maybe. How long ago Val? About six months. It's only open like six months. Oh yeah. I didn't get him a tech with Jamie then. I hear it's beautiful. I hear it's, you know, it's a good size room. Yeah. And it's doing well. It's kicking ass and there's a lot of comedy clubs, but that would be one of the best. Does Vegas have a comedy scene? They have open mic nights or anything? Well, you have, uh, a lot of them do, but you got a lot of clubs there now, you know, uh, you got the bread Garrett Room. You've got the laugh factory. Um, you got it. There's a comedy club right at the Riviera downstairs from the starlight theater. Does, you know the, it's the Riviera comedy club.

Speaker 5:          02:15:00       Um, you have, I know, you know downtown, there's a lot of clubs. I never go downtown, but books the river these days. It's not Steve Shrimp anymore. No, I think no way he would keep that after this problem. No, no, it's, it's just the Riviera books. I don't know the, the big guy in the soprano's, what was his character in the Sopranos name? Bobby. Bobby. Bobby is Steve Sherpa. We've known Steve like before he was ever an actor. He was the guy who ran the Riviera. You know what? I would get crazy with him too, because I think he's a talented guy and he's really likable, you know? And when he was doing the sopranos, like one in the last, I'm like, where's the new show you're going to do? Because even though he played a gangster, they still this lovable guy and I'm going to buy it.

Speaker 5:          02:15:44       You kind of have an ABC Sitcom after this. You're the father of three. It's that simple. Right. You know, and, and I'm still waiting for it because I loved that guy. It's a lot of, it's hard for a lot of those guys to transition from my show. That's not memorable, but not all of them. See a lot of them were real tough guys like just from, from real life guys that have been in jail, you know, some of them were, were relaxed is but, but [inaudible] even though he was with the gangsters, he still has that likability, you know, that he could have transitioned very easily. She tried to find out, I'm like, dude, you know, he might still, they're wearing the sopranos again. Are they really? You should try to find out if he could do it. If the Riviera. Yeah. Yeah. The Riviera comedy club. That's a good spot. Pick a room you want. I want like a hundred, like

Speaker 6:          02:16:29       a smaller room. Hundred 50. I have you ever comedy club? Yeah. That's easy. I could probably help you with that. What does the Riviera hold? It was a whole 150 maybe. Well, the comedy club, Kali holds about 300 does it? Okay. And then the place upstairs where you were at, Dad holds like five 75. So what, like what is that? The place where that uh, Mark Moreno used to have a, Frank Marino used to have his drag queen show. Thanks. So, yeah, there's like a couple theater. It's the only theater I saw in the river. There's also a thousand seat theater just like that. And by the way, you got to use up the word drag queen while you can, before they decide to take all of that. It's too intense. You're not supposed to use twink anymore. Do you know that even gay guys get in trouble for using the word twink? I never heard it until the second tank in the gay community. A twink is like a small hairless sort of boyish looking gay boy.

Speaker 6:          02:17:23       Do you have any idea why did you have to say that to me? And then the Andy Cohen and people in, in the audiences, you know, what are you a twink? Yeah, exactly. That's the new thing. And the big guys. A bears. Yeah, they just wanted to be called tings. But Andy Cohen, the guy who runs bravo got in trouble. Uh, he forced to apologize for, uh, calling someone twinks. He had to like, he's, and he's gay. He's a gay guy and I love this show. I love that a gay guy had to apologize for using the word twink. I mean, that is God damn cold and I love that guy. He's trainees that they don't want to be called trannies anymore. I used to call them goals. Well, yeah, that was my joke. I go, you meet the girly a dreams, right? Like I would start off, I go, you know, first you got these bisexuals.

Speaker 6:          02:18:15       You know, what does that mean? You either suck dick or you don't Suck Dick. Right? What do you get up in the morning? I got to remember this shit. You know, flip a coin heads. I want hip height, tails balls across the nose, and then I go and now you've got these other things. He's a trans testicles. You meet the girl, he had dreams. You want to know your dining. You put your hand up a script, you're holding a fucking tree trunk. You know, this is what the guy said. Okay, this is how crazy people are today. Andy Cohen, who's the guys, he's, I guess he's the head of Bravo, I guess he's always on those shows. He's always like acting as a, uh, you know, we watch the show here. Well he's, this is what he wrote on Twitter. No joke. I just raw walked right into one direction.

Speaker 6:          02:18:56       Green Room, I guess one direction as a band. The blonde dude was shirtless. He says, and then his tweet Hashtag holy twink so he's calling the blonde. He said the blonde dude was a twink. He's like, obviously he's saying he's like a hot little piece of ass and he had to apologize for that misused word earlier. I just meant they're cute. He tried to write that to cover up his truck. That's what we've been talking even, you know, cause we were talking about it with comedy, but think about that. That's so ridiculous to say. You got to, you know, have a, an apology ready, quit Twinkies. It could you call a press conference, get behind a fucking podium and go, I'm sorry. I called the little hot boy. A twink. Twink is a contentious word and is sometimes seen as a derogatory definition referring to a certain type of homosexual.

Speaker 6:          02:19:47       Thus Andy experienced crazy Twitter backlash concerning his comment. What a group of contacts we have, which is the s just a bunch of silly cunts. Just silly dumb people. Yeah. Now how come people don't get mad at that word anymore? I Dunno. I'm going to use that word to the wheels. Fall off. I will never give up. Kind of hold onto Khan. You will prime my dead. Hands off the word con. I apologize too. Like who was like a bangle? Twinks yeah, it's, Bob says you have to apologize to the fans, I guess of the band. That's what he had to apologize for using that word. But the people were upset that the word twink was a derogatory term, but it's being used by a gay guy. It's like me constantly. Again, it's silly. It's stupid, but just like check out those twinkle twinkles I mean there's, there's so the craziest culture, even in the harshest conditions.

Speaker 6:          02:20:33       Most of my family's Italian. If I called someone a crazy Guinea and you got mad at me, you can go fuck yourself. That's not racist. It's me. I will tell you, I'm a mostly, I'm mostly Guinea, you know, and that's a source of all sorts of problems with me biologically. And they did say that. You can't say that it's, it's fucking stupid. This guy is a gay guy and he's calling someone a twink. If there's wrong with that, there's no hope for world. That's what I'm saying. People talk, you know what? Everybody like it, you know, we can't have that. It's just fucking stupid already. You know, you say a little thing, a cute little thing, you know, he was looking at the guy, it got probably look, I mean who dresses better than Andy? Not only that, it's like he's dressed perfectly every me and my wife watched the show cause we watch all those crazy, you know, housewives, you know the Miami, you see them?

Speaker 6:          02:21:23       Yeah, they fight. They're the only ones worth watching. They fight, you know, let's Cuba bitches this, they're tropical. They'll throw low that you could understand. You know what I mean? Like when we go to Florida, my wife will catch me just watching the Tele Mundo and all the dressing rooms, you know, and now you can at least understand what the fuck they're saying. It's a Ma amazing that just following idiots around with a camera has become awesome entertainment. But at sometimes that could take it. Sometimes I can't. Yeah, this is me, you know, because it's, you know all those shows. It's about the fight now. You know it's always about the fighting. You know what I watch man, I don't want to see these chicks banging. All are these days is Alaska shows. I've been on this crazy Alaska kick for the last couple of months cause it's like four or five different shows about people trying to survive in Alaska.

Speaker 6:          02:22:10       It's fascinating shit man. Watching people out there just trying to catch as many salmon as they can freeze because they have to realize that it's going to be winter for eight months. That's all I've been watching. So I watched that and then I watch like the real housewives shows and they looked so stupid because their issues are so small. Like in the Alaska shows, they're like, I got to go show you. You can't compare, you know? Yeah. You know, real life shit to a, you know, well you called what I did and you know Anneka and they stand for that. And then the one with the boyfriend that just as fucking everything behind her back split. We love each other. Shut up and fuck somebody else already. Let's start a new storyline here. What am I going to see? 13 episodes of you fighting with the guy that owns nightclubs, about other chicks.

Speaker 6:          02:22:59       Didn't you know what you were getting involved in? Did you use your fucking head for a split second already? Yeah. He's silly bitch. You know, that's, that's what goes on with these girls. It's like, just stop it if he's not feel bang somebody else already. Well it's just interesting that that would even be entertaining to people. It really is because so much pleasure. It's almost like saying to people, get out of their cars and start an argument. You're going to watch it. But when I watched the difference between no shows and these Alaska shows, these subsistence living shows, but I do because it's humans. I'm just watching humans in Alaska live their life and it's like I'm watching live their life they live in and looking to survive to the problem is what I think is that all their, their, their natural needs have been taken care of as far as like gathering food, having a place of shelter, being protected from the elements.

Speaker 6:          02:23:49       You don't have to worry about that. That's interesting to watch because they don't have to worry about that shit. Then they constantly on this bitch says something to me and I'm going to conduct, they're always fucking drunk. Every fucking show, every radio. I don't want to get angry over reality shows, but every one of them, you know, well let's meet for breakfast and they're opening up dumb. Right. You know, well, why are we drinking at breakfast? Because you don't have to go collect Caribou and all of that. That's right. Yeah. You're not cutting a hole in the fucking night if you have to go out there and go shoot a bear. Otherwise you have no meat in your freezer. That's a completely different situation. This thing. Yeah, it's what it is. You know, I can't feel bad, you know, for a girl that's living in an 18,000 square foot home, you know, drinking liquor for breakfast, you know, but I could feel bad for the, you know, the Little Alaska and guy that my fault, where the ice.

Speaker 6:          02:24:43       I feel like if I had to choose between living with those cons in Miami or live in, in Alaska, I would live in Alaska and I'd have to go with the Miami thing. I don't think it would be able, if I had to live with them. If you had to live in a house with those people or live in Alaska, it's still a chip. There's, they're so dumb. There's so much dumbness. There's so much where you would just like, I'm going to have to hypnotize you people and start from scratch because there's only one way. We're gonna have to raise your mind and I'm going to have to program, you know, I'm going to get up. You have a lot of checks to see. I'll tell you a show you would like cause it reminds me of you, the way they explain everything happening. Uh, what is it? I shouldn't have been around it, but I was what? What's the name should be

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       the Nitel or your next album. And she should been around them. But I always forget the exact, she knows what going to be alive. I shouldn't be alive. Oh yeah. Like you know what I mean? I shouldn't have been around live, but it was, they decide what a beautiful day I'm going to climb the biggest mountain in the world. Yeah. Well thinking, you know, this is going to go off without a hitch with that guy when it through his fucking arm. The guy who got stuck under that rock and they made a movie about him.

Speaker 5:          02:25:56       No, but have you watched the show I'm talking about? Yes. Yeah, I've seen it. Yeah. And they explain things like, you know, I always go back to salt, you know, mineral is a mineral. That lady that's still probably sitting there shaking. You know, I get so mad over the woman's a monster. She was a monster all night. She's a monster in the audience who's a monster. And she was like a middle aged lady, right? No, no. She's like late thirties overweight. Angry. Nope. And you weren't even looking at her and she was like talking to somebody else about salt and what you call it again. Oh no, she was telling everybody how good for Ya. Just sitting minding his own business and all of a sudden the rage, you know, it was like a show off the stage. It goes, what the fuck are you talking about?

Speaker 5:          02:26:45       What do you know about anything? Like he knew her. Like she knows nothing about anything. He goes, hey, tough fucking mineral. You tell this story every time you do this. I love cause you didn't see your face. That was the beauty of that. And I explained to you that that kind of had been a problem all night. But I always forget that part. Yeah, that part's not as interesting. But when you know, when she was telling people about salt, but you shouldn't have any salt in your diet. And I was like, what? It says the central mineral stupid. Like, what are you talking about? Tow. It started and then you've got to change. Then it was Rogan mean that she wasn't there for that. I wasn't there. That was when it got, you know my other thing, I know I bring that up all the time, but I like the way you break things down is what I'm saying.

Speaker 5:          02:27:27       That's what I was really like on the show. Like uh, I shouldn't have been around it, but it was like they break it down like everything that's happening to the person and I know you really understand those things. That shows a bad show. I'll tell you a thing I like to do on different shows with the same guy, like if it's the same host of a radio show or something, I love to congratulate them on their wife's pregnancy. Knowing there is none, you know? And if the second time the guy would be like, dice you said this last time, my wife isn't pregnant. And I go, no, what, what? She had the baby and he's called, she was never pregnant. We don't even want kids and they get angry about it. And I'll just stay on it every time I come on. But that's purposely, well you would have these, I love to effect people.

Speaker 5:          02:28:13       These little gags that you would run at the store. We'd have people like acting out certain things. You were videotaping it with cameras so you'd like get off stage and there was like a play going on in the fucking hallway. Like what? What is happening? You got to see those tapes. I'm telling you. What do you do with all those tapes? Nothing. This is what I think the pilot has to be. I just love filming it. I this is what the, I think [inaudible] your podcast. Tom Green always calls me up. He goes, let's film something. And I'm like, for what? All I do is film. Cause he likes doing that shit too. But he'll actually air somewhere. He'll put it somewhere. How awesome would this be if you had, you just had a humongous box of tapes behind you all random and each podcast at the beginning he just grabbed one, put it in.

Speaker 5:          02:28:54       He kind of gave like a commentary while it's going on. Like, oh, this is from, you know, the comedy store obviously. Let's see what's going on here. What I was doing it, no, that's actually funny. But that was since to those tapes, you know, even though it seems like when he goes, Joe, it asks me, he goes, what are you doing with the camera? And I'm like, I'm filming the show. But that was no show, but yet I was making it a show and I really just love, so when I'd come to the comedy store, you know, I'd still kicking weight and the show is going on in the original room. I used the store as my set, you know, and like the newer comics at the time, like, uh, like Steve Run is easy. You know, Ori, uh, Bobby Lee, these were like the, the new generation of comics coming.

Speaker 5:          02:29:40       So I would, I would film all these guys and they couldn't wait for me to get there because they never knew what they had to do. And I would tell them exactly what I need them to say, you know? And I would say, all right, you wait four seconds and you say it exactly like they didn't even have a choices. How to say it as an actor, why didn't you do something with it all? Who am I going to do? But you spent so much time, we were looking forward to it. You have no idea how. I was like, wow, one day I die, it's going to release it. And you're like, oh okay. Well my son Max says, you know, we got to, these are the lost tapes. We got to call them and start putting things on like youtube, have them edit it into little cause said we'll always scenarios going on.

Speaker 5:          02:30:21       How many hours of footage do you have? Oh thousands. Thousands. You know, just madness. I have this, uh, this, uh, cause I did film a lot of stuff career wise that um, there's this young filmmakers names John Myers and he's, he's putting together, he's lugging all my footage now to make a, you know, documentary movie. That's what it was. But I filmed, you know, all the way back. Like first it was all the big shows being on the road, all of it. I'd get my home life if that's how I started with practicing. Just filming myself without a crew.

Speaker 1:          02:30:57       And the special comes out this Monday night, New Year's Eve as Monday night, right? New Year's Eve. This Monday night show time. What time is it? 10:00 PM 10:00 PM and uh, and so it's over at 11 it's a one hour show. So set your dvrs if you're not going to be home, if you're out partying second dvrs and check it out. That show that I saw in Vegas was fucking awesome. And the best comedy

Speaker 6:          02:31:20       shows I've seen in a long time. Last 10 years. You read bed, we fucking how old? It was really fun. It was, it was just a fun night with you guys hanging out. It was, we had a great time. It was old school dice and it was, you know, Anthony Kumi and Jim Norton and Sam. It was, we had a great crew. Bobby Kelly was there too. Yeah. I love that you made me like love that guy. I know Bobby Kelly. I didn't know him up to that point. He's the best. Yeah. Just a nice guy. You know what I mean? Very, very. And of course I had a fuck with him at the beginning and what he to that can't get a picture for what? Yeah. You know, we don't know each other. You know, like why would you want a picture of us like in a book and then I took like 20 of them with them.

Speaker 6:          02:31:59       Yeah. He loves you that that show is fucking phenomenal. And that's going to be the basement, the same set as it's more intense than what you saw. I mean the same material, a lot of the same fucking great, great, great stuff. And it's like I said, it's old school dies. It's really like going back to some of your, your earlier work, keeping the voice it would say and just, you know, pounding on people aggressive. Well, yeah, I got pretty aggressive with some guy in the front row that wanted to talk when I'm doing, you know, film, you know, and I had to threaten him, but I left it in, you know, you know, because I know people watching. You're going to look and go, yeah, he's threatening to choke this guy. Yeah. You know, it was great stuff. It's great material. And if it's even better than that, then the show that I saw in Vegas, because I still had months after you were there, so other bits came.
