Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hannibal Montana, is that it? Montana will experience the Hannibal. Montana will experience. Can you get sued for that? That too. Or it's parody, right? Is Hannibal Montana Bowl bowls at the end? What is a Montana? Both Montana Bill Rams is Ramsar Hannibal. What is Hannah Montana? See this the show that a cute girl. Cyrus girl, right. I hope they sued me to use the bump. They can't win. I can't win. Right. It's parody is. Yeah. It is not a mock usually just because I think it's just a goofy thing. Isn't that my Canadian thing? Isn't that I'm not using any imagery. I just think it's just funny words to me. Even if you were, you know, I think you're okay. Whatever happened to that chick. She was going crazy for awhile. She a number. She was grinding on people on TV. The voice right now that's just started.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       She said she wanted the judges or something. Hm. She's talented girl. You ever heard of talent? She sang that song. Jolene, like that Dolly Parton Song. I was like, wow. Like if she just sang shit like this, she'd be goddamn gigantic. If she changes to with transfer. Really? Yeah, I think she saw that actress. What have you seen her in her stuff? She's been on Saturday night live. Oh, okay. I thought you that. Hannah Montana. Hannah Montana back in [inaudible] eight when I was. I remember watching a couple of episodes like this is all right. Also my, uh, I used to be a dad fan fence who so there used to be a dad fan fan fan. Took too much heat, man. He did. God Man. I remember when dad fan was on last comic standing because it was season one and I was one of the judges and he fucking killed.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       Right. And it didn't seem like there was anything wrong what he was doing to me. Yeah. But a lot of people get mad at them just for being. No, it was like they just thought he was too, uh, too. Too much of a big show. You know, he's too loud and I don't know what it was. If they got upset with him. People like what they like. People get angry, people get angry at weird stuff. People just get specifically angry. Myself included, but I don't share that for the Internet, just angry amongst my friends and we talk shit, but I don't like to show that. Right. Like he'd get mad if your friend likes a movie that sucked. Yeah. We'll just, yeah. Sometimes my friend, my friend, um, didn't. What was the movie with the, uh, with the moving shots? Uh, it was Zach Galifianakis is in it. Uh, the Birdman Birdman. Oh, Zach. Zach Galifianakis was in Burbank. The stage director. That's right. Of course I met my friend Tony. We would denver a toadie Turner. My Dj, he uh, had wanted them. We patches. We in Denver for like four

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       days and he had a weed patch did you could put on. He got it from dispensary. Uh, and then he got high engine. We started talking about Birdman. Yeah. Birdman. He went on a 10 minute rant, like fuck birdman movies. Pretentious. And he's just like, man, he was like, I like Birdman, but I don't know if I like it as much as you hated it went on forever.

Speaker 3:          00:03:20       I couldn't believe it. He's Kinda got a point. It's kind of pretentious, but I mean don't you want that sometimes like someone to take a chance to make something that's just bizarre. There was a bizarre ass movie like that was a chance to take a newbie and then.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       Yeah, they was, I enjoyed it. I'd never seen somebody be so passionate about it. Be around your friendly. I didn't know you were a kid.

Speaker 3:          00:03:41       Hey, people get like that with music. Yeah. You know, you can talk to some people about certain bands. Just not supposed to. Like, like when I was a kid I used to have to hide the fact that I loved kiss. Yeah. Because like when I was in like seventh grade kiss was not cool. I was like, it was not a cool thing. Like the young kids, they won't, they all wanted to know about like ACDC and led Zeppelin. So where, uh, when you were in seventh grade where was kiss in their trajectory? Here's what happened with kiss kiss had this gigantic loyal following who came to all their concerts. They sold out gigantic arenas all over the world, but they couldn't get any radio play. It was a real weird. They only have like a couple of big hits they have like bath. Bath was a big hit. Detroit rock city, rock and roll all night. Those were big in party every day. That's still a big one, but there wasn't a lot of radio play. It was hard, like there was a lot of bands that had way more radio play, but for whatever reason, they never lost their popularity amongst their hardcore fans because they put on a great show. I went to see them twice when they made their comeback tour with Kevin James. Kevin James was. No, no, no, no. We were friends. We went to watch it.

Speaker 4:          00:04:55       Kevin. Combination that would be doing some standup up. Have you ever done stand up in front of a band? Lots of times, yeah. Do you really? Yeah. Do you like it?

Speaker 2:          00:05:11       Sometimes. Sometimes it can go. Well, you have to be set up correctly though, and I've learned how to. What's asked for to make this show go right. What's. What do you ask for? You just asked for somebody from the band to introduce you. Either onstage or off my and so you establish in front of the crowd as a friend of theirs and that just some asshole that where the band says, we booked this guy, this guy, please welcome Hannibal buress. I learned that when I open for this band, it's cool. Super Nice guys. They saw me as Zane. He's in Chicago, the Chicago band, a jam band. Unfree Mcgee's a huge fan base. They tour all the time and they asked me to do this gig and the cow outside of Chicago. So excited to do it. Just a couple hundred bucks or something different gig opening for a band is cool and it's packed.

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       Theater is packed. And then uh, they telling me that, you know, it's getting ready to go out and uh, the lights drop and the crowd goes crazy and I'm about to go home and that is not for me at all. And so then I just walk out and cold like hello, I'm Hannah. And started trying to do comedy. And people just like, where's unfreeze? And they just didn't know. We didn't know to just, you know, every crowd isn't ready for comedy. You have to settle, people have to be expecting it'll be settled or it's a fight and I wasn't prepped to fight at that a moment just to fight them down. I did all right, but that's it. Sometimes I'll do shows where I have a rappers or band's opened for me also and sometimes the crowd at some people in the crowd into it, some people aren't, but it's music that I enjoy so I try to just mix it up sometimes and have a bit of a variety show versus just straight stand up.

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       Why not? That's what you want to do. You definitely do it. I've, I've opened for a few bands back in the day, but I'll never do it again. Some of the experiences were just terrific. Yeah. I opened for Bon Jovi once it's theater in the round. It was just thing for vh one. It was in the round and I was on stage with like a bunch of musical instruments, like a lot of like it's like there was a drum kit there, how to move around. I couldn't do anything physical. There was like a little microphone set up and then uh, after I did my set, I was supposed to bring girls towards the front of the stage. They wanted to pick out attractive girls in the audience, go back saying no, no, no, around the stage. So the one they're filming it, they're the ones who are really close to the camera, screaming Bon Jovi and then dirt bag for backstage.

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       Right if they turned you and to me into the wrangler. But you can also grab some girls. Here's the deal, Bro. Were Road dogs know they, uh, they wanted a bunch of because they were filming it for like vh one, I think it was at the time, but I was like, I can't do keep you on these. They just don't go well 50 percent of the time. Yeah, it's, I mean I've done some, you know, chance the rapper, his rapper out of Chicago. Uh, I've done some stuff with him and sometimes he'll go, well, and it was one in Chicago and I'm from Chicago. So I'm thinking this is going to be great. This is my city to dude. It was just, it was because I made fun of a, you know, Chicago is that live in the city will, uh, sometimes you, you'll meet somebody and you're like, where are you from?

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       Chicago. What part of Chicago was like? Schaumburg, Chicago, suburban. That's what that Improv is 40 minutes outside of Chicago. It's a suburban kind of city, sort of thousand oaks. Yeah. That type of thing. And so I talked about that. I did that on stage. It was just, it was the venue was in the city and then I talked about that on stage, but most of that crowd was like white kids from the suburbs and then it just turned from that and they were just started. It just got, got restless and then some dude just yelled out for no reason. Just like Kevin Hart. I was like, what does that mean? Wow, that's hilarious. Some psychology shit, right? He's going to point to the most successful comic ever compare. You mean Kevin Hart is, if he's not the most successful, he's like top two, right? I mean, who, who, what are the arguments?

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       There's three arguments, right? It's like dice clay, Dane Cook and Kevin Hart and as far as sustaining it, yeah, he's. His run has been pretty crazy insane and he has his own shoe, so I think it's him. He's kind of motivational shoe, motivational quotes all over it and it's. Shoot. Actually Kevin Hart's shoot looks better than a lot of athletes. Shoes. Definitely. He's a smart dude. He's worked hard, but that's funny that he thinks that like yelling that out. It's going to hurt your feelings. It was just more weird. It is weird. It is weird, but that's a, that's a, that's a jab. You know, it's interesting that people do that. Like you point to like La as if almost as if someone's success, even though it's like astronomical, like crazy success even to a really successful guy like you. It will fuck with you.

Speaker 2:          00:10:06       You know what I mean? Yeah. I mean you do really well. I know you're not walking around going bad. I wish my life was fucking better right now. No, you're great. Everything's awesome in your world. Everything is smooth as fuck. But someone can yell out. Kevin Hart know people, it's a, it's a weird space to be in because some night now you have that to that. It's a different way. You got your fans and then you also have people that just know who you are and might fuck with you at all. They just know they like. And so I, I went into this Mexican restaurant in Chicago last week

Speaker 4:          00:10:42       and uh, I uh,

Speaker 2:          00:10:46       I go straight to the bathroom and it is a great spot in Chicago by the way, check it out. Are in

Speaker 4:          00:10:51       Lincoln and Fullerton and uh, go to the back

Speaker 2:          00:10:56       and I come back out as he's tall too tall black woman and uh, one of them like I'm right next to us. She gestures towards me. Yeah, he's famous or something like real dismissive. I hadn't said anything to her. I was just being famous or something. And she says to me, yeah, my friends tried to get me to come hang out with you at mad river bar in Chicago. Had tried to get you to come and hang out, but we didn't want to. All right, why don't you. But we didn't want to. Yeah, some like what are you, what's happening right now? Like what are you. And so I look at her body and she's in great shape at six to short, short song. She got a volleyball books, so I say, you play volleyball? She said, yeah, we played at Depaul and so, uh, they order their food

Speaker 4:          00:11:37       down to order my food, sit down and then I go on my phone and I google a depaul women's volleyball and look at a last year and look at the roster and I look over to her. I say, uh, Hey Ashley, what the fuck happened last season? They had a bad season

Speaker 5:          00:12:05       and in a friend pipes up. Hey, we had a lot of good individual competency assessment, individual records last year. And I said, so you guys had bad teeth?

Speaker 4:          00:12:12       Chemistry?

Speaker 5:          00:12:16       But yeah, it was just, I felt the need to dig back because I was just grabbing some fucking tacos and she just made me feel weird just by being there.

Speaker 4:          00:12:24       Well, she felt like she could get a free shot at you because you're famous war or she just does that to people all the time.

Speaker 5:          00:12:31       Maybe she does. Maybe she just had a baby. I was intimidated. She was tall. Beautiful girl, beautiful girl. We were like a voice. Maybe a town like mine. Maybe I couldn't handle my own tone is actually. Sounds like you not like me, but she had kind of not depth but just suck. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:12:51       Tone that way. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe she was being rude. She may have been just a big rude, giant bitch at once. Like dude, to take that challenge. You know what I mean? Like if you're a girl that's that big and athletic, he could probably fuck up a lot of dudes. Yeah. You know, that's a big girl. She probably has to like, she probably has to test dudes all the time.

Speaker 5:          00:13:12       Maybe. Maybe she was nagging me and I took it the wrong way.

Speaker 4:          00:13:17       Yeah. Maybe if you just took it like an ace, you just rolled with it. Like a Shaolin Monk. Yeah. Maybe you did neck back, but the. But that. That's actually pretty funny. So wait, did I think everything works out great? I mean, I know where to find them. Find it. I don't know why. I always want to wonder what someone's motivation is, but I always do. I do too. You never know. It's almost like, why am I bothering? Why can I just get the fuck away from this? Why do I have to find out what someone's motivation is?

Speaker 5:          00:13:45       Yeah. People, yeah. I ended up in, in conversations where I should just probably leave, but I'm just curious about what's going on. Like who the fuck are you? Why? What is your,

Speaker 4:          00:13:56       what? What's up with you? Do that. Yeah. And also I have to. When I have to win. Well, it's a game that you're really good at. Shit talking game. You get upset when someone starts talking with you. I'm like, wait a minute. You're a goddamn amateur here. You should talk about the professional comedian. How often have you done this? How good are you at this? For Real. It was fun though. It is fun. It's all fun and games to someone's soul gets crushed. He doesn't happen in Vegas. Just a. It was this girl that I.

Speaker 5:          00:14:31       no, not really known that well, but she's beautiful and she hit me up out of nowhere. Hey, I miss you, we never messed around and anything, you know, and I was just as you, she missed you. And so, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:14:43       I uh,

Speaker 5:          00:14:45       I was in Boston at the moment. I think I'll just in a sort of a, not a bad move, a weird mood, impulsive and she just hit me up out of nowhere that, let's go to vegas with a UFC fight, shit flyer out. We'd get to the airport around the same time, go out, go to a Calvin Harris has playing, go there and we get back to the room and she's Kinda like cold towards me. Like almost buddy. I'm like, Eh, I mean we never really hung out, but it's still like flying to Vegas. It's a, it's a vibe and it's a little bit of a subtext to that is vegas also this associates, she kind of just go to sleep on me. I'm like, we ain't gonna fucking vegas visas. What the fuck is going on? What's happening? You thought you missed? And so, uh, end up, uh, in the morning, go for it again. Like, she's kind of, it's like, I'm like, does this chick even like, you know, it's like I go down on her, she's completely quiet, but like moving her body positively, but not saying a word but not saying a word to the point where I'm like, I gotta check and see if this is okay. I popped my head up. I'm like, Hey, we good

Speaker 2:          00:15:59       just because I had to do it. Had to do a consent check. Marius. That's a good move though. Yeah, Dude. I had to check. Man, are we good? You good? She's like, we're good. I was back at it, but she didn't make a noise. You know, how weird pussies and sounds with no moaning or yeps uh, yes it would. Nothing. No, no, it was just, it was weird. But I could tell she I've been thinking about nothing else for no moaning, just acapella pussy eating. But I could feel her body, like she's moving the body around. I could, I could tell she came a couple times [inaudible] like air came out. I don't think that's how it works. I think it is. I was like, because at one point yet I feel some air coming out. It wasn't a, but it didn't make a noise. Um, I don't think we're ever going to really know if they're coming or not.

Speaker 2:          00:17:00       I think it can be a lot of fuckery going on. A lot of fake orgasms. We don't know. A lot of times girls just fake come so that you could stop real. I don't know, I'm guessing it must've happened, but I'm just saying I don't think error coming out constitutes orgasm. Seems like it should. Well there should be like a little Turkey tests or the baby. She loves me. Whatever. We ended up hooking up, but I go out to lunch and then I realized we just no, no computer, no compatibility. All this chicken does it. Even like when you eat her pussy. So I need to know, need to know. It's just lazier. Doesn't like it,

Speaker 5:          00:17:42       it all or it's just bad at showing it does. It can't even fake. Just wants to be at the Pfizer. So we get back to the room. I'm getting ready. It's like three ish. So getting rambling. I'm gonna. See the whole thing, you'll see the prelims and uh, uh, so, but I'm trying to get it in again, isn't hooked up again. First Time you have to tell me. And then she says, I don't Hook up on the first night. I'm like, we already did it already. What are you talking about? She's like, yeah, that's my role. I don't do it on. It's like, what are you talking about? She's like, my, me and my roommates. That's our house rule or how's your cock blocking bitches? You fucking fly out in the first eight. What are you talking about? You already, we already did it and it's not your house is it? And so like what is, I don't want to know who does that. That's weird. And so I Kinda, I stepped out of the room, make a phone call. I talk to my friends to consultant. What the fuck do I do with this shit? And

Speaker 4:          00:18:41       sleeve all your shit in the room and buy new shit. That's what you do. You just know you just, you, you have your phone in your hand. Do you have a computer back in the room? I didn't. Okay, so you go back in, you don't want to leave the computer, you go grab your computer, you go, I'll be right back. And then you never come back. That's what I came back in. I came back and came back in a room. I say I buy new clothes. No, I'm going to take somebody out in the fight with the computer that have been great. I said I would do it. I say I'm going to take somebody else to the fight. Oh Shit.

Speaker 5:          00:19:16       Uh Oh. I have my assistant gets you a separate hotel room and I'll buy you a single ticket to the fight if you want. But you know, I don't feel like you feeling me and it'd be a disservice to both of us in wasting each other's time, but you have another hotel room. I'll get you a ticket to the.

Speaker 4:          00:19:33       That's a gentleman's move. I like, that's better than what I was gonna do. I was going to run out the door with a computer, but it felt weird to do it and it felt weird to build up to doing it. But I had a great night. Man, I hung out with another friend in Vegas and she's much better person. Beautiful. Yeah. It's weird though. Well that's my fault for that, but you haven't had a real conversation with her and I flew this woman out. That's how beautiful she was. Why you took a chance life so fast. You could meet someone like that on the first night. They could be the best person you ever met in your life and you fall in love forever. Right, Jamie? That's true. I mean you definitely can. I support you on both decisions. Yeah. I support you on your impulsiveness and just flying out a beautiful woman and I support you in continuing to eat her pussy and asking for consent and the middle of it. I support you on that. Definitely support you. Getting there another room and doing it classy and getting her a ticket to the ticket, but that's. Yeah, even better. Can I support you 100 percent. That's a fuck. You got an a plus or if I was your teacher, your professor and how to be a man. I gave you a fucking a plus. Thank you. I'm getting better. I'm grown up, successful comedian with resources. Fly that lady out.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       She might be the girl you dreams. Maybe be able to settle down next time. Burse settled down. It's hard trying to grown up. I bought a building up also real estate. Bought an apartment building in Chicago. Oh Shit. A whole building. The whole building. Three unit apartment building. Do you live in it? I just bought it. Don't. I don't live in his tenants now, but I want to airbnb. Wow, that's interesting man. What if you started fucking Hannibal burress hotel? I was thinking that's what. That's like a five, 10 year, five, maybe 10 years now. I would have to either get other people in with funding and stuff, but I looked at this one place. It's just one building in Chicago, but it's a. it's a lot of money and they will have to be an all cash buyer and I can't do it, so I'm trying to get other people to partner up.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       Man. The hotel business sounds interesting, like if you like. Have you developed a cool because it's kind of entertaining in a way like you're in attain those people. It's not off bro, my man, I'm traveling all the time. I'm in hotels so I kind of know what I like in a, in a hotel, but you know what I mean, like the experience of going to a hotel is and a lot of ways like an entertaining experimentally, the lounge, what you have in a lot of stuff in the rooms, you know, in a lot of ways. Like even the other way like there's a motel six and catch a Canada, Alaska that I stayed at and uh, it's fucking great or hotel sector, hotel sex. But uh, because it's so ridiculous because it's in this really remote place. Yeah. It's, there's something cool about that. You know, there's something cool about just the standard ness of it all the wood panels on the door and you know, like that kind of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       I don't even know if they have wood panels, but you know what I mean like that. Like Standard Motel six type look when you even near a place like that that like if you went to a place like Ketchikan Alaska and there was a four seasons right now with like a, some sort of a fireplace as broken glass in it. Like one of those, one of those weird ones. You'd be like, what the fuck is this? It wouldn't make any sense, but the Hannibal burress hotel, I seen a lot of red velure. I see a lot like this room. I see red valora black see gold lace. I see like a beautiful design to the place. I hear good music, good food. Smells good. Food is good. It's wonderful. Our food. Twenty four hour food, reasonable many bar prices. I'm like I need to make a profit but I'm not going to fuck you over.

Speaker 1:          00:23:10       How many people were talking about in this hotel? How big? Little right? Like a boatload of one for the first one, something like 20 to 30 rooms, something like that. That's beautiful. That's like a fucking party. 20 rooms, it's like a party, like if you had like we all have, we all gathered up all of our friends that we knew and we all brought girlfriends or wives and there's 20 of us. We could. We could fill a goddamn 20 room hotel. Yeah, easy. Definitely man, that's a good move. Trying to. I want to do entertainment for fun like seven years from now and that foot money. Yeah. You know what I mean? Whereas that was not necessary to go on the road or do a TV show or do a movie where it's like, I would really love to do that. Well then I'm torn because I want your hotel to be successful, but I want you to keep doing comedy.

Speaker 1:          00:24:02       I don't want you to turn into a lazy pitch. Not a lazy bitch, but I would be doing stuff with my real estate. I wanna I wanna get my goal. I want to get another building this year and him. You're a magnet and do to get to multifamily properties a year for the next five years and then ran for president and then. No, no, because that only pays 400,000 a year, but it's the speaking fees. Speaking feats, whew. That's when you make all your money. You do do your eight years. Then when you get out, you make a billion dollars on bomb is gonna. Make a. let me tell you a couple of millions. You don't know who should be rooting and crossing his fingers that trump wins as obama because if, if trump wins, Obama will make so much fucking money. Talking about, you know, like democracy and giving speeches about what it's like to be a president and what it's like to run the greatest nation in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:24:57       Fine. Either way, trump always going to be fine either way, but he couldn't like it literally doubled his money. If trump ones deep. Here's a theory. A lot of people have said, Nah, I don't think he wants to win. Do you think he wants to win with the moves he's been pulling? I don't know man. They said he has one office, one campaign office in Florida that has four employees. You had perfect like Hashtag tiger blood. He's not. I mean, beyond the idiotic shit he said he's not really running an efficient campaign. It's entirely possible that he doesn't really want to win. If you think about it, it's entirely possible that he thought that it would be like, remember when Howard stern ran for governor of New York because that nineties? Yeah. Something like that wasn't Jamie. Um, I think it was somewhere in there, but, um, I don't think Howard stern really wanted to be the governor.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       Governor, governor. Uh, I just think he wanted to have some fun. Right. And that might've been what happened with Donald Trump. Like he might've been just thinking he was going to make a splash. Have some fun and a nice into deep. Yeah. He was still doing his TV show back then. Remember, like he was still the celebrity apprentice guy or whatever. It is not a celebrity apprentice. Is that the name of the show? Why is it sounds so stupid. Just the apprentice. Then it was the apprentice. So NBC fired him from that show. Yeah, because you were saying a bunch of shit about Mexicans and when they fired him from the show, that's when he ramped it up and when he ramped it up, that's when he got more and more popular and that's when he won the Republican nomination. Like it's all part of it is because NBC canceled his fucking show. That's what happened and this is where we got to blame. We got NBC and we got Caitlyn Jenner because there's a part of America

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       that when Caitlyn Jenner one the woman of the year have to being a woman for six months and when espn did that giant piece on her and you know, they're fucking flying over our house with a helicopter and the drapes are blowing in the breeze and she's hiding in the shadows and you're like, what the fuck? There's a part of America that was like, fuck this know. Got To put our foot down. We got to put our fucking foot down now. And then trump came along. I'm an asshole. And they were like, I'm an asshole to stand up, stand proud people got upset. I think there's like an ebb and flow to shit. I think when things go too left wing, too progressive to transgenders in the bathroom, all that crazy shit when that. When that goes down, there's a part of America just not ready yet and they go foot and that's where you get trump has ssi. That solitary solid right

Speaker 2:          00:27:34       is. I'm a little fascinated. When I watched the people in the crowd just really agreeing, lift the bullshit. He said when he said the stuff, black people, what are you got to lose? You add no jobs. Everybody's in poverty and it's people in the back like, yeah, yeah. He said a speech. It's a speech. Oh, please fill in. The black voters just say you don't. There's no jobs. You live in poverty. The schools are bad. It's 58 percent unemployment with the youth. I mean, what do you got to lose? It's pretty good impression.

Speaker 3:          00:28:10       It's not bad. I know exactly who you're doing. While we were watching earlier when he said that Obama founded isis. We're watching that earlier with like, this is like a pro wrestling show. Like he's saying some crazy shit for it, but he's saying some plates. We could hear it. Jamie

Speaker 6:          00:28:29       trump asking for the vote of every scene. African-Americans suffered under democratic control. To those I say the following. Oh my God, what do you have to lose by trying something new like trump?

Speaker 7:          00:28:48       What do you have to lose? I hope he's high as fuck right now and he's making a documentary shadow from the head cover. It is dumb eyes, Chris Bells filming all this serious. Secretly look at them. They're all screaming, cheering this black woman back there

Speaker 6:          00:29:08       again. What do you look? Why do you have to lose? You're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?

Speaker 7:          00:29:25       Wow. It's amazing to watch the movies. A coen brothers movie.

Speaker 6:          00:29:30       Let the end of four years. I guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African American vote. I you.

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       I promise you why? But even just saying that, like, what? Who gives a shit? If you're what? What percentage? How do you know that? He doesn't have a plan, he just talk. It is. It's fat, but the crowd is wet. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:29:56       If he was doing that for 30 people, like, okay, I get it, but

Speaker 3:          00:30:02       I have some pretty significant theories. I think that people are way too soft. I think it's way too easy to stay alive and I think we've never ever had that in human history and I think that we're over because of it at a ridiculous rate and I think there's a bunch of people out there that have no business fucking and slash or having kids. Well, you just turned very serious. I'm fucking serious. And it's not their fault. It's no one's fault. It's no one's fault. It's just the cycle that we're in. We're in a cycle of safety. We're in a cycle of safety. That's what we're in a cycle of recreational outrage. People are getting outrage at things that don't make any sense. The reason why there's no life threatening situations that are constantly at your door. There's no wolves, there's no fucking. Nothing's going wrong. So we're, we're going after words. You can't say retarded anymore, you know, don't say tranny. Don't, we're getting outraged about shit that doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 5:          00:30:57       Product of the Internet is that didn't survive the war.

Speaker 3:          00:31:02       Bad example. Having wolves to come at you. You're doing. I think that's just a product of the Internet. People being able to react to something and being able to, uh, gather together on something and then start a petition. Yeah. Those are bad examples I have who's retarded is not a bad example because it's like, it doesn't, that doesn't mean a disease. It just means someone who's slow to get things. We should not a medically imply that you're picking on someone with a mental illness. And in fact, when people initially had down syndrome, when the birth certificates would come, it would call them a mongoloid idiot. That would be like what it would be listed on the actual birth certificate. Mongoloid Mongolo idiot. Very straightforward. It's very straightforward and very bizarre, harsh, hard times. These are hard times, but we're talking about. It's good. It looks. Everything is good. It's better to be alive right now is as good as it gets. This is a beautiful time, but we're going to get things like that. We're going to get things like that trump thing because it's so fucking easy to stay alive, to be alive. But it's fun. It's fun for it to be easy to be alive. Exactly. I was at my friend's house. Just kind of bounced back.

Speaker 5:          00:32:08       Yeah. He was playing ps four and uh, he was playing baseball on a ps four, which I think is horrible. It wasn't horrible. Baseball video games. I'm not in. So give me football game, a basketball game. He fighting, give me a fighting game, give me some, some shooting. But baseball, it's not good on a video game that to me, obviously it's everybody likes what they likes, but I'm over there as a guest. He doesn't even have a second controller. And I, uh, so I, I went on my phone when a postmates target ps four controller, the UFC two game. They brought it was there in 20 minutes. Twenty of my friend's house. I don't even, I don't even have a ps four. I just wanted to play something different. They can do that. They came through with with the UFC game under control and we hooked that shit up and then we went and we were playing UFC. How the hell did they do that? It's because they. It's just basically a delivery. You just use the posts. It's not target. It's postmates where as a person and they are driving around in eight waiting for orders. Wow. Yeah, so I'll take that over and wolves. Fuck yeah, no, I'm not saying that. I know. I know. I know.

Speaker 3:          00:33:22       Thinks is the best time to be alive ever for sure, but there's guys like you and this guy's like a lot of my other friends and that I'm just happy to know and happy to be around and then there's a bunch of people out there unfortunately, and for them they've been exposed to some bad ideas and they don't have the best genetics and they're living in somewhere that sucks and they get to vote too.

Speaker 5:          00:33:44       Right. I do see when I do, I'll see. I, I'm, I love reading comments on articles just to just to see is that real? Is that a real human being that thinks that that's the date in fascinated all the time where it hurts me and it makes me happy. At the same time, I can't believe that I live on the same earth. Is that type of person that that thinks that for real or a person that really thinks that trump will be president. A person that has these will trump could use about that.

Speaker 3:          00:34:15       Right? I mean it's halfway there. He's the Republican nominee.

Speaker 5:          00:34:19       He is. He's got a super far. I don't think about that. I don't think it's going to happen from here. The fact that he's gotten his closest crazy. It's crazy,

Speaker 3:          00:34:26       but I think those people that you're talking about that you can't believe, they think that way. They're a product of whatever the fuck happened to them in their world. Like there's pockets of the world that are all a mess right now and if you were born in that pocket or I was born in that pocket and the same sort of circumstances. That's one of the things that. It's hard. It's hard to recognize as a person. You see someone's an asshole. He just goes, fucking asshole, fuck them, but in a way we kind of kind of look at those people go, damn, they just got fucked. They got born into a group of dummies with a bunch of violent tendencies and crime and bullshit and nonsense and this is all they've ever known and they just trying to get by and you know, a guy like trump comes in

Speaker 8:          00:35:05       how long ago

Speaker 3:          00:35:10       and if it wasn't trump, it could be a number of motivational speakers all throughout the country that might have nefarious intentions. Yeah. Anybody who's really like super charismatic now it's kind of open game. Like when a guy like trump can come along and talk as much crazy shit as he has and in, in some ways I'm not opposed to him women because in some ways I'm like, look, he has the best guy to fuck this system in the ass and we know this system sucks. It's almost like this guy's a suicide bomber. Like trump's like this wild dude with a vest and a sweaty face and he just run it into that cafe.

Speaker 3:          00:35:52       Boom. Well, he had a two party system is flawed anyways. I'm going to put that on a meme. It could be more than two vbl able to run short. It should be. She'd be a lot. Do you know Tom Rhodes? Yeah. He was on Duncan trussell's podcast the other day and he was talking about um, the way it's set up in Holland. Taylor seven? Yeah. Something. Jamie see if he could find out how many candidates they have, how many parties rather than they have in Holland, but it's many, many, many, and they're all like, they're real reasonable like how they're placed and there's, I'm sure there's like a lot of us, me included that we were upset because there's some things on one side of that I agree with some things on another side I agree with and some things that aren't being represented at all.

Speaker 3:          00:36:39       Like the idea that these two people and whatever opinions they discussed, the only opinions that we should all be talking about. That's crazy. It's crazy. Should be more. Why can't they collaborate on that? Trump is looking how many they have in Holland. This is crazy how many. They have jamie 11, but there's 17, six, seven. Didn't vote in the 2012 elections, so that might be brand new. I'm not sure if they have 11 different parties voted in the last year. They all had candidates. Wow. See that's. That's right. That's how it should be done. We were getting hoodwinked by a group of people that are just controlling this ancient system and it's not a good system and they know it's not a good system, but the only way you could ever stop this system is you have to have people with pure hearts and minds that are willing to admit the system sucks, so they're going to lose whatever position of influence that they have and step back and be judged by the merit of their own ideas.

Speaker 3:          00:37:35       Again, instead of being a senator or congressman or a president, they just say, look, this system sucks. It sucks. I think it sucks. Let's get to get the best legal scholars and and people that understand human nature and let's can conduct and compose a system that works and let's really run the government like it's one of us and that we're all in this together. These old folks don't realize that they just, they just cling to power until they're in the grave. They just hang onto it like it's her route. Pancan over the abyss. They know what they're going to drop into it. They don't want to let go, oh, well, you need to control these independence. Reduced the number of percentages they have to. That's just the way it's going to be, man. I'm fascinated by that. Just the level of obviously we have egos to what to do what we do, but to one of run a country, just the level, dude, if you can't take jokes, he can't play basketball and you're not really good at fighting.

Speaker 3:          00:38:33       You find a way to be special. Parts of this are different. It's a weird impulse, different type of of pressure. Here's the weirdest thing about that impulse. When you see someone out there in the world, when you see someone that you admire, whether it's an athlete or a brilliant scholar or whoever the fuck it is, you see someone, a musician, you see some, you really admire. That person has accomplished something amazing, right? All the president asked to do is get people to like them, right? That's it. Like Obama really didn't have a whole lot of experience in the world, like creating things or making things. It went from being a lawyer to a senator,

Speaker 5:          00:39:18       right? Community activists and then state senator in the Senate. It mean. And he got it. I think. I don't know if the state senate, but he got it because uh, he moved up because the dude had a sex scandal in Illinois.

Speaker 3:          00:39:35       Oh, that's right. That's right. And what does that do? That's your state. I forget who it was, but he does not like, like, like pick a person, like a, you know, some, some great person in history that's done something amazing and you, you look at them and you're like, wow, I would love it if that great person of, of wisdom and accomplishment if that person was step up and be president. Yeah. It doesn't necessarily have to be the case in America. All you have to do is just be liked. Right? That's Kinda crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:40:07       It is. It is. It is. I don't even know. I mean both Hillary and trump. Art Seventy or 65.

Speaker 3:          00:40:18       Yeah. They're telling you why are you doing that? Right. Doing it. People can dream but don't dream so big. Dude. You're 30 and you're thinking about retiring 33. I'm already buying hotels and picking them up.

Speaker 5:          00:40:31       Strategy. I'm thinking about. I'm a hundred percent because I like this. I like, I enjoy this, but I mean I see. I see how I could go. I just see how I look at how other people have handled their moment and how other people handled their finances and I don't want to any part of that. So I'm making every step. Every thing I do everyday is about, been super stable seven years from now and comfortable and to have enough passive income.

Speaker 3:          00:41:01       I don't have to worry about that. That's very smart, man. Very smart. And you're doing it like in a real proactive way. Not a whole lot of people look at it that way. Everybody else just sort of like rides it out, you know, or it's a weird mindset, right? It's like the investment mindset is so different than the creative mindset. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:41:18       It's just, just look, I mean it's just, you know, not just spending smart and just researched a lot now and just, you know, shifting my internet time from the bullshit. So just looking at properties and that's smart to do something else, man. And just, I, I just don't, I don't want to end up on those special. He spent 2014 and the other that not a real Hollywood story. I don't want to be on some goofy ass show that I don't want to be doing eight years from now where you're like, oh, he definitely needed the money. I don't want to do anything.

Speaker 3:          00:41:57       Isn't that a funny? Don't want to say, man, that's a funny conversation because we all know what it's like. Have you ever been in our bad show

Speaker 5:          00:42:03       on a badge? Like a bad TV? No, not really. I haven't done that much. That many different TVS. Just a bunch of

Speaker 3:          00:42:11       dudes out there right now working in lumberyards, driving trucks, taken math, trying to stay awake, listening to us right now going, you fucking bitches are complaining about being a Shitty TV show. Where do I sign up, bro? Fuck. Do I sign up? Get out of this job. And you're right folks. You're right. You gotta you gotta humorous. You got a humorous because I've been on a bad show and uh, I was on a show that was even, was worse than a bad show. Good show. It turned into a bad show. I was on the show called hardball and it started out. These guys who wrote it, they wrote for the simpsons, they wrote from married with children, Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran, really smart guys and they, um, they wrote this hilarious pilot. We did a, Jim Brewer was in the pilot and I was in the pilot and a bunch of other people that wind up doing, doing a bunch of different movies and shit and it was a funny pilot and then the network got ahold of it and they just, Oh fuck the shit out of it.

Speaker 3:          00:43:02       And they throw in some really hacky producer who wound up getting he will. He wound up getting fired like halfway through the six episodes that we did and it was allegedly, there was a bunch of other shit going on and the writing was off the charts bad. It was. So I got to be like on a bad show, but it's a terrible feeling for season. Next six episodes six. That was the first. The first one was the pilot, which was really funny. And then it just was like, all of a sudden it was over here doing something that was terrible and you're better off doing nothing than doing something you hate. Yeah. That doesn't make any sense because you make money and ultimately it's worth doing. And ultimately for me it was definitely worth something because I learned from the experience. You can't just do a TV show. You got to be sure. And even if you're sure, like the pilot was really funny. I was pretty sure that that would be okay. It doesn't matter because a bunch of other factors can fall into place. Yeah. I just remembered I did do a bad show. Is My TV show last shit?

Speaker 3:          00:44:01       What happened with that?

Speaker 5:          00:44:02       It uh, I think it mean we had our moments, but it just,

Speaker 3:          00:44:06       it might need some more booze to get the truth out of here with some ice.

Speaker 5:          00:44:13       It's just, it had his moments, but we didn't, we, they came with the idea that came to me and the producing comedy central. It basically, this is the show, this idea. Adam will do a sketches man on the street stuff. Just just figuring out the quest answers to these questions, but it's just, I guess we didn't really focus it in focus, the, uh, the point of view and it was kind of all over the place and we had our funny moments and did some, a couple of good sketches, but it just, by the end of it, it didn't feel I wasn't excited anymore those last two episodes where just, you know, and we do it in front of a live audience. It really was just about finishing that shit man, that man. But I, I'm happy I did it and that I had that moment where, you know, for what, what was that two months last year at my own TV show. Not a lot of people get to say that. Uh, but, uh, yeah, it's just, you know, you learned a lot. I learned a lot. It was fun. Got To work with some cool people. But yeah, it just wasn't as far as what I wanted my first, uh, you know, kind of headline and project to be a. It wasn't that beautiful. Jamison

Speaker 3:          00:45:32       and whiskey and nice just brought up, um, now what, what were you trying to do and what went wrong? You know, what my interviewer now give me, give me some ice. I sounded like Matt Lauer was like I do. I just went into interview mode as I got some ice.

Speaker 5:          00:45:51       I think I kind of went into it not, you know, not really knowing. I mean I learned later on how to run things better and how to give people direction on what I needed a little bit better, but I don't think we came in with a focus because I was thinking with a TV show that not that we would completely winging it, but that we would, uh, be able to kind of find it as we go. We never did a true pilot episode. Cheers. Cit. We never did a true pilot episode. I pilot episode was our premier episode and I look at some of my choices. I chose this weird ass closing bit on there. Well, Oh, why did I pick that as a bit? I didn't write it, but I liked it. Sometimes you'd like stuff in the writer's room that is hilarious, and then you execute that shit. And what were we doing?

Speaker 3:          00:46:49       Can I ask you a question? Sure. Okay. Outside of a television show, if you were just sitting around and someone said, Hannibal, I want you to just be your creative self. Would you ever gravitate towards writing sketches?

Speaker 5:          00:47:01       What I gravitate towards, right. And Yeah, just on your own. Oh my own. No, but it was sometimes where I come up with something that definitely works better visually than, uh, than Stan does stand up. Oh, I try to tell a standup bit like, but it will work better, uh, visually animated or as a sketch yet.

Speaker 3:          00:47:24       Yeah, definitely. I agree. There's, there's, there's some subjects that I've had an abandoned because they really did. I thought they were hilarious, but I couldn't. They just didn't, weren't there were a better idea for a play than they would be for a standup comedy? Yeah. But when we're coming up, everybody wanted to be on Saturday night live because Eddie Murphy was on there. Everybody wanted to be on sketch comedy shows because that would lead to these big careers like Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider and all these people that we became like these huge movie stars, right? So we all like gravitate towards acting and then there was sitcoms where Rosanne made all this money and then Seinfeld made all this money. He's like, Oh shit, I gotta get to. Yeah. But when I was on that bad sitcom halfway and I was like, this is not what I wanted to do.

Speaker 3:          00:48:10       Right? I fucked up. I listened to the I want to do stand up. If it does what I want to do now with a guy like you, like what I want to hear as you talk about everything I don't want to hear. I mean I want to hear you doing prepared shit. If that's what you want to do. Like what I would want to hear from you. If I was a producer and I was a network and I was comedy central, I would say handle, listen, fuck. All these executives. Fuck all these producers. What do you think is funny? What do you want to do? I want to know. I don't want a bunch of people filtering the Hannibal Vision by the time, like when Doug, Stan hope and I did the man show, which was a giant mistake. One of the big problems with was with that show was like with Doug and I had a fucked up idea by the time it would get to.

Speaker 3:          00:48:52       It would be all watered down by the time we'd ever get to the television. There's no way you could just have the only way to do that. It's like the Internet. The Internet is the only way where you could just like if someone was smart, they would come along and they would say, listen, if I was comedy central, I would say animal. It's just like a bunch of money and we're just going to give you a production team and just come up with whatever the fuck you want to come up with. I want you to take six months. Just think about what you want to do is. I know it's going to be funny. I think you're hilarious. I'll take six months, come up with whatever the fuck you want to do, let's put this shit online, do this, come on mobile. And then if they wanted to make a television show out of that, I mean that's what happened with Arisa fear show.

Speaker 3:          00:49:36       Yeah. Yeah. It will do it as the online thing. And the honestly the online's better. It's better to get on the online. No, it's going to online. It's there always. Is there any minute of any day. If it's just the TV version of it. I mean once it goes online then it becomes equal to the online version, but there's no like loss and not having the TV version because like if someone watches comedy central during the show, when Ariz on like what is always ratings, what did he get? Like a million dollars an episode or a million people in episode? A million dollars an episode. He'd be very happy. It's crazy. But if he got a million people an episode, like you could easily, if you had a crazy viral video like some of Joey Diaz videos, they probably have close to a million. Right? How many Joey's um, things on a, this is not happening. Have more than a million. Find out what Joey Diaz his stories on this is not happening

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       now. I guarantee you they have a million people. I mean it's just people don't watch it on their phone. They could watch whatever they tell your friends. Yeah. Yeah. So if you did that and you had a show like that, it was just you. If you, if you really want to do a show, just you doing whatever the fuck you think is funny.

Speaker 9:          00:50:50       Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:50:52       I'd watch them and figure it out. A dvr the shit out of that show. I'm going to figure it out. I've been kind of. What do we got here? That's us. What is this? This is not happening. Joey Diaz. One million. One hundred 29,000. Four hundred 87 views. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. I mean that's like, that's real numbers man. I mean that's the same kind of numbers you get if you have a TV show. It's the same shit, right? Definitely. It's real close, man. We're like maybe a year or two away from the idea of being on a television show being no different than the idea of being on a youtube show or even, I mean, a lot of these, I'm doing some celebrities react a shell on Thursday where they, like, our viewership is four times the average TV show, like the, in the, in the email, they, they talk about their numbers like this two times and knowing what is four times that is, isn't it, didn't have a crazy subscriber list, uh, in all on youtube, millions of subscribers.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       Youtube is where it's at for a lot of things. It's just a matter of we just A. I mean, that's how comedy central now judges the success of that shows not just on the, on, on air, the initial area, it judge it based on the facebook shares, the youtube stuff, the snapchat thing and all that's to come. It's a combined a formula they use to judge the successful show. It's smart. I mean, that's really the way to think about it because they have to be honest. This is a giant percentage of the people that are gonna Watch her show on youtube or any other weather. I mean, I don't know how many people watch comedy central Dot Com. Do you know? I would imagine it's not nearly as much as youtube, but what's amazing about youtube is there's only one youtube. Yeah, like how is there not a million youtube? How is it not a million of these weird websites where you can just upload video anytime you want and watch the craziest shit all day long. I mean there's live leak, right? There's a. What are the, what are the other ones? A lot of weird ones that are, that are based on. They're not popular. Not why. Yeah. Well because one popular one. If you say Google bought Youtube though,

Speaker 9:          00:53:12       skynet

Speaker 1:          00:53:16       hundred and $35. Million Bucks is all that tape too. That's it for Youtube. Yeah. That's good. When did they buy? 2,000. Four or five. I think. How much does Kanye is entire

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       sneaker line worth? If he sold every sneaker, is that 100 million worth of pretty close to that problem? That's probably pretty close. Yeah. That's amazing. That's how much they paid for that. For Youtube. Youtube is a monster. Yeah. It's somehow or another in this world of the Internet where there's probably like what? How many hundreds of millions of websites? I take that back side or correct that one point six, 5 billion in stock now, the owner's son of a bitch, Jesus Chamie. Meanwhile, here's some perspective. The UFC sold for 4 billion. It's more valuable to kick people in. The deq and the head an elbow in the face than it is to create youtube.

Speaker 10:         00:54:13       Yeah, I looked something up on it the other day. I think that's why there's numbers were stuck in my head. It's a, at least from what I read at cost, something like six point $7,000,000,000 to run youtube right now every year, year. And like the revenue they're getting my baby just from ads. It's like less than 5 billion. So they're taking a loss on it. But why is, that's just for doing the future bet. Kinda like it won't be that for four or five more years. It's just how it happened.

Speaker 4:          00:54:35       Oh, so that's why there's only one youtube. It's fucking tough, but that makes sense. It's amazing though. I mean that's a. If you want to talk about an incredible example of success, like youtube is the only video upstream place that everybody or upload place that everybody recognizes instantly in the sea of the Internet is a, that's incredible. As top management. They do do some shit. You do. Do you do ads with them? No, no, I mean they put up ads but I don't have anything to do with it. Um, we do just adds on this show and then we upload the, the difference between the Youtube version of this show and the podcast version. The podcast version has, um, has, uh, uh, adds that we read, you know, like from, um, a promo, a email thing, and then the youtube one has no ads. It just goes up.

Speaker 4:          00:55:32       And then whatever ads, youtube ads and ads for. I took someone with a on it Zealand, I think I'm feeling, I don't know, maybe the, the whiskey is cancelling it out, but maybe I'm just normal now. I'm feeling a little drunk. I'm good. Yeah, I'm just not going to help the drunk too much. Maybe it'll help you formulate sentences. Meanwhile, the word formulate came out. Very clumsy. Formulate. You ever been to Israel? No. Have you know? Hmm. I got offered a Gig and Israel don't go in June. Reactionary. I don't know. You should go to. Sure you took it. I took the Gig. Um, when is it for? It was supposed to be in Gillette. Supposed to be spoiler alert on earth lead,

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       but still an interesting story. I so took this gig in Israel in Tel Aviv only because my ex girlfriend is Israeli is Israeli. And so I'm thinking, fuck, you have a machine gun in your mouth? No, she's Israeli. I'm thinking, Hey, maybe she wants to come on this trip with me. You know what I mean? I'll take this, I'll take this and a well. And then I took the Gig, turns out she was mad because he was like, you didn't go to Tel Aviv with me when we were together. So now I got this Gig in Tel Aviv, this not even routed with anything else. And then I started getting these tweets when people, why are you going to Tel Aviv? Do you know what they're doing to the Palestinian people supporting genocide? I'm like, I was just trying to get back on my ex girlfriend. Be like, you are supporting hate. You put the support and the Zionist. I'm like, I didn't know. I just heard he was dope beaches.

Speaker 5:          00:57:39       I was getting all these. And they like, why? Why would you do this? Join these other artists that are boycotting Israel. Is that common a boy? I think it was like I live. I think it was, it was a bunch of other people that won't tour vanilla ice, vanilla ice. Uh, Craig Zappa. Uh, Craig Mac. Yeah, correct. Mac. Ellen Degeneres, a g depth. A Little Wayne and lot of people bet midler won't go over there. Oh my God. But yeah. So it was just fun and getting all of these angry political tweets. Okay. That is fucked up. What's going on over there? But that's not. Can I be sympathetic and also maybe do this gig. I ended up canceling Gig, but now because of the tweets and the anger was just because I booked a movie that completely with it,

Speaker 4:          00:58:29       the movie was more important than in the motherland. But let me ask you this. Honestly. If the girl was going to go with you, he knew you're going to get your freak on. Would you have taken the Gig over the movie? Have you? Would you have broken her heart and not taking her back to the motherland? I wouldn't send the back another time. Another time. Move a gentlemen. See not. It's over bitch. Sorry you missed it. I'm on fast and furious. Fifty 6,000 girl. I'll be so pissed for a dude. Broke my crazy trip to Israel for fast and the furious 56 to do three, three lines in it. Fuck you. And Fuck. Vin Diesel. Fuck you. Get run over by a charger and that's a good move though. Take her another time. But did you guys communicate afterwards? Did you settle down to the issue that you never took her to go

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       to Israel? Why you guys settled? I don't think that is some issues you a you can't settle down and you just work on what you can work on. Again, let me bring this up. Recreational outrage and let me pose a scenario. Okay. Here's the scenario. You two are living in a cave. Okay. And a bear to say her sister and you guys saw it and he escaped and you, you, you fought off the bear's friends with a spear and you made the best friends. Other than 500,000 years ago, handle a $500. Where the other barriers, other barriers instead of friends? I'm making it up as I go a little bit. Made it sound like when you said the vas for hasn't made it sound like it could be like a direct where the animals, that's it. Good. This other big. Don't think bears a friend was anything they can eat, but I just assume it's parents, friends, just other bears.

Speaker 3:          01:00:12       It's another. I'm so sorry. You make a really good point. So you're managing to save this girl from being predated upon by these monsters. Just giant monsters. You fight them off and you get her up to a top case carrier over your shoulders. You lay her down on the landscape. Yes, unscathed, but her sisters debt. Yeah, and you, you, you lay her down on the skins of a bear that you have also killed yourself with a fucking spirit. Had a separate system with a separate situation. This is all clean every day. Yeah. She's not going to complain about you not taking her to the motherland, to Israel when you guys were dating. She's not going to give a fuck because the stakes are much higher. This is you, your hero. You've saved her physical entity. You've said to her soul, from passing on to the next generation of doubt, this beyond land where no one knows what the fuck is really going on and you get glimpses.

Speaker 3:          01:01:10       If you take mushrooms, you stick your head and you pop it back and you never really quite sure whether or not whether you saw whatever you saw was real. Then you would fuck her on that fucking rug. But meanwhile, yeah, you would. You'd fucker. You'd be happy. She'd be happy for saving her life and maybe not her sister. How about a cousin? Her cousin who was kind of Cunty, her cousin who was fat and big shed giant ankles, and she hated her whole life because she had shitty genetics. She got pink hair. She likes to bully small boys. How about that girl? Maybe you'd have to ask her. Can imagine if that was the case in the. In the cave people community. There was this one girl was like cock blocker. She had rules. She's like, I can't fuck you because my friends tell we all have a role when we go back to a room. We just, we just can't do it. I can't fuck a guy on the first date, first date, only after he's built at least seven fires for, you know, so sad. So sad. People not being able to be themselves because they met so many people along the

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       way that weren't themselves. And they're like, God damn it. I can't show you yet. Yeah. I can't take off my Kabuki mask and show you the soul. Eternal self. Yeah, I do. Sometimes I, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:02:35       this, uh, it was this waitress at the, uh, at, at the Darra smoke a joint. His restaurant is a good store, I can tell. And, and she was, uh, she was beautiful when I was hanging out with my friend in vegas that she's cool with, you know, I can openly talk about other women with her while she was like, yes, she's beautiful. She's and this waitress, she was so aka lesbian, I don't know if that's the word, but this wages was so beautiful. You ever meet a waitress way? She'd be playing like the superfly sound dry. Do you haven't meet a wages where you shouldn't be a waitress? It was, she, it wasn't about her looks. She just had a sort of composure to, uh, just kinda restrained. She was beautiful, but still,

Speaker 1:          01:03:34       she doesn't know yet that people will look at you weird if you're a waitress. That's what it is. She's a young person who doesn't understand and if she's lucky, she meets a guy like Hannibal burress who doesn't judge her for the fact that she,

Speaker 5:          01:03:48       when she brought me in a bill, I wanted to say, I want to say, what are your dreams and how can I help with them?

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       Wow. Did you say? No? I didn't say why you didn't say it because we don't hang out enough. But if I was right next to you and be like, dude, it was the same time. Let this shit go. Fuck it. Who gives a fuck?

Speaker 5:          01:04:10       Do you miss her?

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       I uh, I don't miss it. No, but I know where she is. I know she's in. She's in Vegas. How long ago was this? This was a, this was yesterday. You should go back to Vegas. Are done. Fly back. But you know why I didn't. Uh, she, she knew who I was and you know, I was at. I didn't want her having to sit with my weird energy for the rest. She had to work her shift after my weird, intense energy on it. So I didn't want to leave that stink on it for the rest of the day. Oh. So that might be me overestimating my effect on people, but you know what I mean, that's very honest with you because she don't need that. That's really honest. Again, Kudos. Eight plus eight plus for handling that weirdness. Yeah. What do you do? I mean maybe she wasn't in you at all. Just thought were really funny most of the time. A lot of the time. A lot of time. When was the fans they own nothing else besides that. And that's fine too. I get, I get sometimes girls happened to dm on instagram and it'll say, hey, you wanna

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       meet up and have a drink and I'll just, uh, sometimes depending on my mood, I said you try to get the pipe just to, just to see what the tone is because that's what a, that's a reference to a Jr Smith for basketball player. Like some girl posted up, a girl posted up his dog. So I'll say that sometimes man amongst men. How about him for president? Run, run. But I'll just say that sometimes because also I don't want. It's funny. I think that's right. I think is whack for a girl just coming my dm. Yeah, that's A. Oh my God. That's brilliant. So I stole that. Familiar with what you're trying to get the pipe. Holy Shit. And that girl blew him up tonight. Dope Smiley face. I'm a Whoa, look. How weird is it? You could see him, but her face is blurred out. Yeah. We should all be able to see both parties.

Speaker 2:          01:06:26       If you want to put this up, you can't hide the darkness. We should be able to know who you are too. That's a weird thing to do. But uh, yeah. So. So I'd like to set the tone sometimes just to see, because I like that word too. [inaudible] girls hit me regular style and just say, Hey, you want to grab drinks? What? You just hit me up the same way you talk to your friend. Hey, you want to grab drinks? Oh their shoes. Say something better to me. I'm a famous comedian. Say something clever. Send a pic or your pussy some cities or some Jesus. Don't just say you want to grab drinks like this is a. This is not a. This is not a normal situation. If it was normal, you wouldn't be hitting me like this. So say something better. I see your point, but they don't want to.

Speaker 2:          01:07:11       Let's think about their point. Their point. I know what that point is. They want to play a casual. They want to play it cool. They want to keep some innuendo and keep it subtle and I get that and sometimes I play along with that Shit Shit to say. Sure. Let's grab a drink, grab a drink and I'll go through with it and then when everything goes down I wanted to go down but sometimes I just want to hear you say it. I want to see you say it right? Yeah, I hear what you're saying. You're saying that you have sexual attraction to them and you want to be sure if this shit goes any further, that this isn't just some weird celebrity thing which ends up being something because sometimes they be like, no, I don't want to. Fuck. I just want to hang out with one of the funniest guys around. Well, you know what? I'm only in this town for a night. I don't want to have drinks with a fan. Just casual platonic as drinks. I think you should value my time warner or here's the other Po. The other possible point of view, they don't understand why they're even attracted to you. They just know they are. Yeah, they know the funny going on. They know that the, the. You're hilarious. They know

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       that you're smart as fuck. They're drawn to you. They're confused. They can't believe they're in contact with a celebrity. Not necessarily. I have to accept the DMV. I know, but they're in contact with. You see a lot of times and I. it's something that I've accepted that sometimes they just want to,

Speaker 2:          01:08:34       they want to hang out for the fucking Brac. This one chick yo at in Athens, Georgia. I use, I use dating apps sometimes and I use bumble, bumble. What is your profile so we can get your lead? It's just A. I deleted it actually recently. Oh girls. Because I was like, I deleted it because I was like, ah, this is too much. There's too much going on. So this chicken, Athens, Athens, Georgia, Athens, Georgia has come through the room. I think that's where forrest Griffin's from. She come to the room about. I'd never met her. I uh, she come through hotel like four. We go over to the hotel bar, grab a beer, come right to the room. It's kind of stiff and awkward, but she's kind of there for and uh, ended up having, we have sex and uh, it was pretty quick. She's about to leave the room and I see you later. I got a towel around my waist. She's like, Eh, can we take a picture real quick? Like, no, they get no fucking post sex. Seth posts, groupie sex selfie. What are you, what world do you live in? Just fucking take this story with you and get Outta here. I'm not getting a Selfie, but I make bad decisions all the time. I feel like we should have a commercial break.

Speaker 1:          01:10:04       I don't know how to deal one yet. We can't splice in commercials. You know? I think, uh, it's hard being a Groupie, just like it's hard being handled burse it's, it, it's hard. It's hard being a person in person. Navigating these waters is weird waters for, for everybody. And I can, I get the energy is bad. Something that bad, but just as a, you know, what's weird thing, here's what's weird. People don't even know why they're attracted to certain people. Didn't understand it, you know, and they try to quantify it. I think, uh, you know, there's some people that are attracted to people in weird ways and then they almost want to test the waters. I want to meet you, Hannibal. I don't think it's even. I don't think it's attractive. I think it's, I think it's a straight up. Sometimes it's attracted and then sometimes it's just straight up your personal television. Your personal stage could be that you have to the, but there are a lot of them were like really young, you know, if a person's 24 years old, how much do they really understand completely about their motivations. Right. You know, or when someone's 22 w, w you're doing, a lot of times it's like on instinct

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       and then you're sort of self correcting as you go along, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:22       Does that make any sense? You just do. I mean made still occasionally make decisions. Whatever. What the. Yeah, of course. Why did I let that person in my apartment? You drink. I should've gotten a hotel room. It's the drinking drank and God dammit, we're drunk right now. I'm going to say I'm drunk at buzz buzz. These are big gas drinks I poured and this is really not smart. Put this on the Internet about to. We're about to give them beamed up, man up and clipped up. Clip it up. We can handle this together. They going to say we're going to be pilot and copilot massaging this comedian, Hannibal burress

Speaker 3:          01:12:07       dude, your unfiltered and everybody wants to be unfiltered, but nobody wants unfiltered. Yeah. Nobody wants unfiltered, but there's a lot of people that don't want unfiltered and they want you to think that nobody wants unfilter yeah. Like you're not saying anything that I wouldn't expect you to say. If we were alone and the microphones were off of you and I were hanging out at the comedy store, we'd have the same conversation. I'd be laughed at the exact same way.

Speaker 2:          01:12:30       Actually we would because it be a bunch of other comedians, ear hustling and I went into just them. But you'll tell it online. Oh, what it is. It's not. It's not. I'm more like this doesn't. It does seem. It seems even though obviously it's way more people listening and watching, but it's more about the visual of other people. Like you know, you having a conversation with somebody and then you feel other people. That's not part of the conversation where that feels more unnatural to me than doing this. You know what I'm saying? I agree a thousand percent. Yeah, and it probably doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make any sense at all. It. That's why it's like

Speaker 3:          01:13:10       I think like it's not their fault if someone's hanging around us. There's been situations like that before where someone is like weaseled into a conversation between me or you or me. It was me and des and some other dude the other night and this guy came up to us and just sandwiches way into a conversation in the kitchen. I'm like, how'd you get back here? Come on man. Like, but part of me, part of me thinks like if I was that guy, how would I do it? What do you do if you walk up, you know, you, you were at the comedy store, you're supposed to go left to take a leak and you go right and you're into the kitchen and Joey Diaz is talking to Ari Shaffir and Hannibal and you guys were all hanging out and hilarious fucking stories are being told and you just want to stand there and stare.

Speaker 2:          01:14:02       Yeah. You want to. I mean you listen to it.

Speaker 3:          01:14:04       I would do it right now. I'll do it right now if those guys hated me for some reason, those guys wouldn't be my friends anymore. I'm like, I don't know what the fuck I did, but

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       damn, I got to find a hole in this vent so I could listen in on and talk

Speaker 5:          01:14:15       two and a lot of weight is interacts as I had lit a fad, which I have a lot because I go out a lot and go drinking and so I'm super exposed to all the time. Uh, but I was in Chattanooga last year. We played this venue and we go out afterwards. Me, my sugar, Al Jackson, I'm a boy. Marcus, a couple of girls we met and we go to this bar, nice bar. Not that many people that maybe 12, 15 people in the whole bar this big as pool tables over on this side. Bars here. They had these wings. They, these smoked wings that I was eating maybe the best ways I've had top five, like I'm crushing them. It was a spiritual experience. What's so good about them? They just well made. They were grilled. They were cooked well, I wish I remember the name was, but it was, the wings were so good ground. I'm just killing these wing, marinated in the zone. Maybe marinated, had good sauce. Hot. You like spicy? I like spicy. I don't remember if he, but I'm destroying these winnings and I'm in the zone. Like it's, it's like, um,

Speaker 4:          01:15:31       I think it was NBA

Speaker 5:          01:15:33       exam. I was on fire and then this dude comes up, man. Hey, I was at the show. Uh, can I take a picture with you? I'm saying yeah man. Just A. I'm eating wings right. I'm eating right now. Let's just give me a few minutes. I'm happy to take a picture. He's like, come on man, let me take a picture. I was just telling me, man, I'm eating right now. Let me, let me just finish eating. And he said, would you rather me take a wing or take a picture? And I said, I'd rather you get the fuck out of my face. Right. I told you because he pushed. He was, it wasn't a crowded bar. It wasn't like a meet and greet. I told him I was happy to take a picture with them afterwards. Just let me finish my. I had sauce all over my hands and shit.

Speaker 5:          01:16:11       It's like they'll give it a few reasonable. Give me a few minutes. He asked. Cool. He asked cooler and I'm reasonable about it and shit, but you know a little bit. I know he's doing a bunch about it, so on the other side of the bar, it's another bigger space with the where the bathroom is. So I go to the bathroom and I step out coincidentally who's at the bathroom. I walked. He don't say nothing. I walked past them and then it's a. it's a long space is before you get to the interest of the bar again and I get there. He's standing by the bathroom door. He yells, thought you were cool. Hannibal thought you were cool. You act like an asshole. I paid $25 for your show. You you're acting like you're Dave Chappelle or some shit. And

Speaker 4:          01:16:57       Hellen Kevin Hart and how many days span between stories far apart from each other, but it's a goat to where people want to try. You try to bring up, right? Yeah. You

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       take your Dave pick up those stories. Me motherfucker. Right? Basically he said, hey, if Dave Chappelle was mean to me when I had kept bothering him while he was eating, I'd get it, but you, you have to give me your day day span. I was like, fuck you. You paid for a show. You didn't pay for fucking meet and greet. I told you I take the fucking picture with you after I was done eating. Then you kept pressing me and so he bitched about the $25 or whatever. Now I'm like sitting and stewing, man about. I'm at the bottom. This motherfucker. I told him I'd take a picture with this barn even crowded. It would have been easier to take a picture with her if he just fucking relax and then I can take $25 out of my pocket. I balled it up. He's over at the pool table.

Speaker 2:          01:17:57       I woke up and I throw it out, take your money back if that's what you wanted, and then he picked. He throws it back everything. I balled it up, hit him in the face with it. Oh my goodness. And then they were ready to fight and I was ready to fight the dude, but then his brother was there and while this was all going on, I'd be like, where's the exit? Who's wearing clothes where I can't tell if they have a gun. And then his friends going on that is fred. I was ready to punch dude acts and then his friend pulled out a camera phone like, oh, your publisher is gonna love this. And I'm like, I guess we're not fighting it by you're ready to fight. Come on. Twenty five bucks. It wasn't about the 25 bucks. It was about, about the words about to just talk and shit and just acting like I wasn't. I was being totally chill in and saying, Hey, I will let me finish. Let me finish eating. Fucking wipe my hands. I'm happy to take a picture with you. And he kept pressing me and then he popped off afterwards. After that. I thought we settled it.

Speaker 3:          01:18:50       Yeah, I know what you mean, man. I'm from someone who's been interrupted while you're eating. It is annoying, but I've always tried to try to figure out like, Whoa, okay, what is, what's the difference between how weird it is for me

Speaker 2:          01:19:05       eating for off to me that is better at that too. Over time where I put myself, it's weird in a spot and I, and I'm nice and I remember and I remember what it is to them for them to, to ask for that.

Speaker 3:          01:19:17       Yeah. Listen man, I got a man crush on Anthony Bourdain that every time I hang around with them I feel goofy.

Speaker 3:          01:19:24       It's just a fact. I just like, like I think I liked the way he thinks. I like his balls. Guy Takes up Jujitsu when he's 58 years old, you know? And uh, like I think in certain situations you have to understand that like the way you feel around someone is affected by your respect for them. And sometimes it gets weird, right? Like if a dude comes up to you, it's like, hey, Hannibal Fan, I've got a picture and you're like, I'm eating right now, man, relax. And that they don't even know what the fuck they're saying. You know, like if, if I'm a Hannibal Fan and I walk up and you got a mouthful wings and was just this real quick, we'll just take this picture. I've got the fuck out of here. I can't believe I took this chance.

Speaker 5:          01:20:06       But I was like, I told them, yeah, I mean, but I get that side of it and that's why I wish I didn't react like that and I wish I, I kept a chill and what I do more often now. But. So it's just,

Speaker 3:          01:20:20       I don't know what you just said is beautiful. I do more often now. So you're thinking about it. I'm aware of it

Speaker 5:          01:20:28       need me to come up to me and just, uh, and I just remember what it is that, that and that it is a, uh, a privilege that they, you know, support my work and, and try to just give them that moment versus. But even still, some mother fuckers I genuinely root and sometimes people can be entitled and sometimes people don't care if you're talking to three women, right?

Speaker 3:          01:20:57       They will, they will bust that shit up. You're right. I mean, it's one of the things about life. You never know who you're going to run into. You run into someone that's just goofy.

Speaker 5:          01:21:08       Yeah. But it's, it's, uh, it's interesting. It's just an interest in Lens, man.

Speaker 3:          01:21:15       It's a, it's an interesting Lens, not just for you, but also for me to look through what you're talking about. But for other people too as well. You know, I think, uh, we're, we're all doing this weird thing, man. We're all just surviving in this strange life that's temporary. If we're lucky, we get a hundred years if you're lucky. But the last super, that's super dope for lucky, for the last few years he was just hang. Yeah, just hanging on and just waiting to get weary enough. So you let go and slip into the abyss.

Speaker 5:          01:21:55       Yeah. I try to keep the perspective, especially in this business willing, this is a. maybe this is a limited moment. This is a limited time.

Speaker 3:          01:22:04       That's good. It's not a hate when people like you say that. That's. I think I was talking about this last time. It's funny as fuck, dude, you're not going anywhere. I hate when someone who's fucking pisses me off. Jim Norton, if you listen to me, you can stop telling me. Stop. Stop telling me you're worried about the. Stop it. You're fucking awesome. I hate when people don't know. They're awesome. You know, relaxed bitch. But even Jim Norton, you're fucking amazing. Hilarious. You have to. You don't have a goddamn thing to worry about. It's going to be people going to see Jim Norton for the end of time and I'm one of them. I feel the same way about you. I mean, I just, I think a seven years, seven more years, hotels got hotels on the stocks, you know, you do stocks up a little bit. I do a really intelligent Jewish gentlemen who handle your money, so because you're too fucking do it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       That's what I do. I, uh, I a big fan of the Jews. They had put some, those people, the money people, they have put a lot of my money in mutual funds. Then I looked at what a mutual fund is with other people buying stocks, but I don't, I don't like that. And a cash album, mutual funds and I want to pick my own stocks. Well, if you're really into owning hotels of picking stocks, I understand me. I'm not into that, you know, a company I like. Is this company called Catapult Sports?

Speaker 2:          01:23:45       They do, they do wearable gps technology who I'm the Golden State Warriors is using some other proteins using like, what are you wearing? Like a steak for practice in different training. They tracked athletes' performance. Wow. How crazy is that? The tracking people from a satellite, how fast they're moving. Just different. I mean, I can't get into the super specifics of it. A Mark Cuban invested in, um, 2014. I, uh, I found them on accident when I was looking up. I was looking up some pharmaceutical company called catalyst and not for some reason my brain put catapult. Then I found this company started looking it up. I found them by accident. I found them on accident, started looking it up and I uh, I invested in of heavily. That's a very good move to do you want to be my manager.

Speaker 2:          01:24:44       So that is a really huge. You got super real, super fortunate. That's like a crazy. But uh, yeah, it, it, it, it was recent as about two months ago at anytime I call my stock guy, I keep up in my position in him and I'll call him as a, put a little, give me $25,000 more on, on catapult. And then he like handled Melissa give me a call real quick. Can't just text him now he just wants to talk me through you show. Oh, you show you. What about that other stock I told you about? You show you that stock is doing way better now. All right. Hey, let's just do. I like catapult, man. Dude, you just blew catapult the fuck up. I liked when you just did. I think it's a solid. I mean, but I, I wouldn't, I've told friends about it. They like it too. I just, it's still early in the company and they got offices in the states. They based in Australia, I think, uh, if I don't know what the fuck it is, explaining it to me. What does it mean? Wearable GPS technology. Now if I'm an idiot and I'm hearing that. Um, okay. So you use a satellite to track the movement of the performance, like heart rate,

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       a workload? Yeah. Sap, it's all done through like what an ankle bracelet. Like what do you, what do you put on them? I think that chest. How do you, how do you know what the exertion is? Is it a vest outside vest? Is it okay? It's a little picture of what that means. Oh, this guy. Oh, that's what you were showing me earlier. Oh, that's different. Okay. That makes sense. This dude just got like a chest harness, which I'm sure could measure. I don't know, like energy. What would it measure? How does something on your chest measure what you're doing with your legs? Like, how do those, uh, iphone apps measure your strides and how many steps you take and you can do it off of like a, there's a, it's not easy math, but they can tell how far off, like if you're six foot and know how long like the, Oh, you enter your height and the whatever it's called.

Speaker 1:          01:26:59       The little interesting cycle. Amateur, I think of the right word. But. So it's not necessarily tracking you through GPS. This one might be, I don't know. This one is right? Isn't that the premise on this one? I mean, how do you know how they do it in the UFC where they're tracking how much, how many feet they're running around the October? That's a good question. They don't have a gps shit. They probably following them with like a tracer, maybe a dude. Uh, it's his job to follow each person with A. I mean, I would do that, but you know what man, that, that statistic is interesting. And I, I, I support the chasing of the data and try to figure out how much someone will be lose. But it's not that important. It's not that important. Yeah, it's weird. It's getting super specific because it doesn't necessarily, uh, it's, it's a statistic.

Speaker 1:          01:27:47       It's interesting. Just didn't dwell on it. So these dudes that are playing soccer, they met the, the monitor all that too, like how much each team runs and all that shit. They just in football, they just recently, the last couple of years stop hitting and practice. Not more because I found out about concussions and whatnot, but it's also added technology and like when I was at cowboys training camp last week, there was a guy telling me they brought an eight k cameras for when Tony Romo was hurt so he could sit in a truck in the back of practice and watch real time football practice with a headset on, like vr stuff. Oh Wow. Shit. And so he could see the real don't give advice on what was going on. He was heard for the last eight weeks or whatever the year and that, they don't have it all the time because it's really expensive to run right now still.

Speaker 1:          01:28:30       But they still had three d, three 60 cameras running around following the players. A crazy stuff. Just shout out to uh, the dude from the Dallas cowboys. He was, what's his name, Charles that drives the Charles? He hooked it up. He gave me a car to give Jamie. It's like, I know Jamie's a football fan. Let's make it happen. Grid iron. They're doing that for the UFC to just trying different things out. Three 60 video. There's new technology will be. There's going to be virtual reality where you're going to be able to like be Nick Diaz as he fights against conor mcgregor. You're gonna. Be able to look through each fighters eyes. They're going to figure out a way to do it. Imagine just a little chip is needed. What, what shape you got Jamie? The s 18. Oh Man. He should have waited for the 19.

Speaker 1:          01:29:17       I know, I know, but I'm pretty happy with the 18. I mean it's, it doesn't take as much battery life. I got 363 d capability. It's just low resolution. It's good. Yep. We're good at video. Game was pretty intense to the new UFC game on ps and I know it sounds like I'm plugging, but it. No, it was cool. We would yelling me and my me and my friend was like, God, like it was that intense because it was, you know, there's parts where you almost want to knock the guy out and then it's a good game. Very good game. Have Fun. So I, I can attest to it because uh, I had to do the commentary for that game. Yeah. Like the, when you hear that EA sports game, that's not commentary from actual fights as commentary. Just me doing pretend and Goldberg don't pretend and do, we did a fuck load of ours. Yeah. I mean it was hours and hours and hours and hours and it was over a long and I'm not complaining, I'm just saying you had to say so much stuff. And there's a man that scan meaning

Speaker 1:          01:30:17       well on a game. Yeah. I'm in the game. You have to, um, have a secret. I got to have a code, like the Konami Code. Oh, I did this so I can get out of doing more commentary because there was so much to do. Tamra wish I looked that good. There was so much to do. Uh, as though it was, it was a constant grind. But I put my app, my full effort into it. Like I, I really wanted it to be good. Oh, I was thinking if I was a kid and I was playing this game, I would want it to sound like, like a guy really got head. It's isn't as like we are. Here it is, man. It, it was a fun. Is like I want to see me get beat the fuck up. Just Jamie. Jamie shown a video of me about to get my ass kicked by Nick Diaz are you get destroyed really fast. I would imagine if the game is realistic, pull it up. I'll come and I get fucked up.

Speaker 7:          01:31:13       But they might have used to show secret character. They might have. You got some bullshit skills. Have you juiced up? It doesn't matter. I got some bullshit with bills. Let's hear my. Because you know, I'm super casual fan, so my commentary. No. Rather with the leg kick. I've never heard this before. Oh, we're all good with the leg kicks. Get kicked in the face. I'll get with the cakes. Diaz is backing it up. Rogan missed. Oh really? It kicked in the chest. Tattoos? Accurate. Look at that. Holy Shit. Oh.

Speaker 1:          01:31:49       Oh.

Speaker 7:          01:31:53       Oh. Broke his neck. Can about the high disadvantage. Ow. Oh ow. Ow. World is in danger. Let's see what rogue his ground game is like. Not Good. Diaz is about the price. Road Dog Shit off my back. Will Rogen. Be able to pull off a submission from this position. Oh, is it? Oh, turnaround. It's called sweep this amount. I let him up. Wow. Good. Back Up. Oh, this should be illegal. Oh, roles should be illegal. Back in two people fake fight. When you know one dude would beat the fuck out of me. No Nice had made. So it's not. Leave any. Any confusion. Oh, this is so stupid. We'll he's out. Wait, let me punch him in the head when he was young.

Speaker 1:          01:32:55       Conscious. Why don't they stop the fight? Quicken a fake me rather than the fake him out. That feels weird, but felt weird. You know what bothered me the most, the last two punches because he wasn't. He was already unconscious. The fake him. Oh, did you know hard? Nick Diaz would fuck me up like this is an embarrassment to humanity is allowed to be a visual image of me. Beat Nick Diaz is dumped all the Brian James. Dude. Enjoy Shit, man. That's what. That's what? That's what? It's an escape. This is what I want to say. I want to see Nick Diaz versus conor Mcgregor. That's what I want to say. I want to see that more than I want to see anything in life. I was. I had, so I want to say I want to see the Aurora borealis more that I want to go to the Keck observatory in Hawaii and revisit the Milky Way more than I want to see any of those things. I want to see Nick Diaz versus.

Speaker 1:          01:33:53       No. Nick Diaz. Conor mcgregor had a cool his little walk around or wearing as he got it. It was awesome. He was awesome. He's a bad motherfucker. Did would, the way he walked around it would have gotten the ring. I didn't think he was going to get punched in the face as much as he did and we still won. But that was a cocky inches. I was like, oh, he bought the first round, knock out this mother fucker. The way he just came in here. Well, I mean, what he's trying to do is just like shake it off, put an air out there. But at the end of the day he's fighting Nate Diaz. He's no one's getting a first round knockout, crazy war. He knew it. He had to be conservative in that fight. Energy was so crazy. It was insane. It was. So. It was. I was so nothing ever right. It was. So. I'm so glad I went to see a lot. Oh Man. So He. Me Too. So, um, uh, as I, as I said, I'm a casual fan. So there's a couple of times where a kinda knocked him to the ground, Kinda doesn't want to do ground game with him because he was, he was, he was, he was, he would tell them to come up. Right. I would think normally for my lack, not much

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       knowledge. I would think once you knock somebody to the ground, you try to go in with those hammerfest

Speaker 3:          01:35:03       you could, you could. However, if you do that with a guy like nate Diaz, he might not be hurt at all, especially when you consider the fact that, uh, he connor through a bunch of really powerful left leg kicks and he had fucked up nate's right leg because, because of the fact that both southpaw, what happens is that back leg becomes the front leg. So the right leg is in front, right? And he's just getting chewed up. But this left power lead character right from the beginning, like over and over and over and over again. When you get hit with a bunch of, like really powerful leg kicks like that, it makes it super difficult for you to move. Right. You know? And then conor just fought a smooth, smart game plan, you know, he um, he engaged from the outside where he, his speed was an advantage and did some damage but didn't unload himself like he did in the first fight, in the first fight.

Speaker 3:          01:35:55       He did that too. But if any unloaded himself a nate survived and when he survived, Connor's gas tank was empty. So this time connor was way more conservative. Yeah. We'll see you running away a little. But he'll run and get, you know, you could, you could say it. He got away from him. He ran away. But when he was on a cake, want to get close to the kt over it and make it more into the sense of it, man. It's okay. You don't. People are mad that he ran away. Who wound your mood? Because sometimes you take a break. Sometimes you take a break. He knows the three moments in the round. He's got he, he knows there's, I mean, I don't know when it was, there was, there was a couple moments in time where he totally turned away from him. But then he engaged.

Speaker 5:          01:36:35       Yeah, he did. It wasn't like he was running the whole. He was just, when he found himself in a compromising position,

Speaker 3:          01:36:41       he would get out of it. It's interesting. It's an interesting thing to do. You guys try to kick your ass. I'm going to go over here for a minute. It's something funny about it. You know? Seemed like a good mood. It's the right move. When you're. When you don't feel like you can fight right now. What do you want to do? Stand in their to get on the boys got mom, get in there. If you don't feel like you can breathe, maybe you should move away and breathe. Otherwise some dude could punch you in the body and you can go down. It's like it's not a smart move to stand in there. If you feel tired,

Speaker 5:          01:37:17       how many fights do you think happened amongst the audience members? Because that's way less than you would think. I saw this girl, she was fighting her boyfriend or something. I don't even know if it's a boyfriend, but she was choking him and she was going crazy. He and she had walked away and she came back to him and then, uh, she was blind and sorta look lightly like Ronda Rousey. I posted it on snapchat. You Ronda Rousey out here tripping and then, uh, and then, uh, and then some immigrate twitter posts. Apparently Ronda Rousey Ronda rousey wouldn't be running

Speaker 1:          01:37:59       crazy and it was a video of you don't really see the face, but you see security chasing some blonde woman that is so stupid. He apparently Hannibal spot at Ronda Rousey. Apparently he's the only one that's nobody else to. That's hilarious. That was so stupid. It was good time. She's like one of the women that you would ever want to fight like at a gas station. You know, like Rhonda Rousey. She throw you in your fucking head on the concrete. That's terrible. It's terrifying. Have women like that out there. I could just beat your ass. Huh?

Speaker 5:          01:38:34       It's terrifying. Like it. Whenever I'm at the UFC and somebody gets kicked in the face, I just always, I just think about how disappointed I'd be if I got kicked in the face of what did I do in my life? Was somebody kicking me in the face. Even especially. I mean you've never been kicked in the face. It's just been kicked in the face. Especially like that's why I'm glad I didn't fight that guy and I'm glad I don't. I don't put myself in situations where I got to fight a strategy because you never know where. I'm just. If, if I was to be fighting, I'm trying to throw hands poorly, but if somebody just kicked me in the face and be like, oh, I didn't, I didn't know you would go do that.

Speaker 1:          01:39:17       Is Donald cerrone combination. God Damn. That's beautiful. Right? Left high kick. Boom. Yeah, and they just turned his back. That is Matrix Shit. DOTS. Ronnie lives in the fucking Matrix. Do Right now at almost 70. He's coming on the podcast next week. Jamie, he's here on next Tuesday. I'm going to fucking convince him. Live on the Internet. Don't drop down from one 70 and one slash 70 is a fucking wizard. Who the hell stop and rick story like this. Um, and Donald cerrone is a fucking wizard. He's a wizard at one 70

Speaker 5:          01:39:50       if it felt it felt kind of barbaric or archaic, but when you have money on my and then beating the shit out of somebody else and you're winning, it's a different type of emotion. When he went serone started fucking that dude up. I stood up.

Speaker 1:          01:40:13       You were in there with them. I was in there. Isn't there with fucking couple thousand dollars? Hell yeah, I was with them. I was in fucking appreciate your loyalty. First of all, it's both on it. And Donald Cerrone, dope. And then a Johnson. Uh, I bet on Johnson right before the fight started, I was like, what were the aunt? He was minus 2:50. So that's pretty reasonable considering how hard he hit and he wanted so fast. So I got on it. We think it's. Somebody told me I have to research it. Please do. Was that the fastest knockout in the history of the light heavyweight division? I think it was close,

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       it was 13 seconds or something. We'll all go to place. My Bet. He hit so hard. That happened so fast. It was like he hit so hard. It happens so quick. When glover started pressuring him, like what? When I score a fight or rather a commentator fight when I watched something like that. And I'm like, okay, what can glow overdue and what can rumble too. We know rumble has awesome stand up skills. We know we had a college wrestling background. We know he's a really powerful and he's probably the hardest hitter ever. So what can we do? He's really technical. He can survive a storm. Maybe he could take him down, maybe get them into deep water. So we start town super aggressive. Bob and we even Tyson style and the one haymaker one haymaker upper cut. So third, Ryan, Jim. Oh Wow. Seven seconds. Goddamn Ryan Chimo.

Speaker 3:          01:41:46       Uh, rest in peace. Ryan. Jim. Oh, he just died recently. I got run over by a car and Canada. Shit. James Irvin Sandman eight seconds. Who did he fight? And then John's John's. Is that gambling to gamble on that? And have it happened in that fast that's like fucking craps. They should put like a 32nd over under on summer rumbles fights. This is literally a 32nd because he's so scary right now. He's so scary. He hits guys in a totally different way. It's like he knows something that nobody knows about. How to hit people. This dude. What was that guy's record? Daddy fought for Alexander. Eight seconds. That's right. What was the guy? Johnson. False record. Was it 25? He was an elite fighter. Oh, glover is beyond elite glover's font for the title. He had a five round fight with Jon Jones. Went to the distance. Yeah. So one of the best fighters in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:42:51       Glover's. Excellent. And that's crazy that he got gotten 13 seconds. You don't what it is, man. There's the human frame. You know, like the skull, the brain, the neck can only take so much. It just can only take so much. Yeah. And most people can't hit that bell. You know that bell when you go to the carnival and he slammed down on that bell and the little thing goes up. And most people can't make that thing Dang in this world. But Rumble Johnson, he can make that thing ding every time with his open barrage you with is a first, you know, name the number 200 punches and kicks, whatever it is. He can knock you the fuck out. The question with a guy like that is, if it gets past that 200 number and the opponent is still there, can you make it through it? And that's what happened in the cormier fight. It's like rumble hit with everything but the kitchen sink. But cormier is so fucking tough. He's so tough from being a world class Olympic wrestler from a guy who competed all over the world. He's just got this. This is like a level of toughness that you can't recreate. And he takes a big bomb but figures out how to scramble and survive. And so he makes it into law. What rounded cormay? Submit rumble.

Speaker 3:          01:44:19       See, the thing about a guy like rumble though is you could submit them once, but once he figures out what you did and he remembers how much it sucked when you did that to him. Can you do it again and if you can't do it again, what if he can figure out how to keep it standing? Yeah. What if he could figure out how to keep hitting you with those barrages of heavy bones coming flying at you with perfect technique. He is so fucking hard, man. What third round? Well, cormay took them into deep water, man. What is comedy is such a bad motherfucker

Speaker 1:          01:44:58       at? Where does that come from? We know that some people just naturally fast. Is that, is that just a uses naturally able to hit hardest fuck. Or do you punch walls? Sometimes you can close it up. You can get better, but it is also a natural sort of this

Speaker 3:          01:45:21       the reality of it. A totally objectively, everybody has a ceiling and you can't pass that ceiling. You see certain people that have certain frames like maybe they have really narrow shoulders and really small hands and it really small waist. They can't generate the same kind of power that a guy like rumble Johnson, Ken, or there's a lot of other guys like guy like rampage Jackson, Ken, for a guy like George St Pierre can. There's. There's certain like physiques, Ilir, Latifa. You ever see that guy fight? No. Pull this motherfucker up. I think he's fighting Ryan Bader. I say motherfucker with all due respect sir. He's just tank of a wrestler and you look at that guys frame and he just bombs on dudes. Knocks him unconscious, but you look at his frame and he's throwing punches.

Speaker 1:          01:46:09       Let's go. Okay. That's like this is. There's levels of athletes, right? There's levels of wrestlers. His levels of strikers and when you see certain dudes, the way they can move their body, like you ever watched Cirque du Solei? Yeah. Even seeing it live, seeing it left 70 degrees. It is amazing. You feel like how the fuck do they do that with their body? You immediately start feeling inadequate with your body. I mean that's why I feel I just can't. I just get inspired by the choreography and I said I need to step my show up. Oh, that's a beautiful one. I'm going to target. I think I want to figure out how to do a handstand with one hand check above being with one hand. So this is hank. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       So he's the light heavyweight and heavyweight light heavyweight two. Oh, five. Okay. So the point being that a gentleman,

Speaker 2:          01:46:56       13 pounds less than me, he's, I'm a light heavyweight. Well me and him one on one.

Speaker 3:          01:47:01       He weighs 200, five for about 13 minutes, probably goes back up to whatever it is before he starts this cut. But my point being like, just like look at the size of that motherfucker. I mean Jesus Christ, look at that dude. He's a tank. There's, there's limitations of the human frame and that guy has a different bone structure than Doogie howser. You know, there's just no denying it. It's or no, that's a bad example. But you know, there's a lot of guys that are his size. They just don't have the kind of advantages that he has. Bone structure wise, physically like what he can do, there's like a certain amount of horsepower at certain guys have and you watch that fight. You look at that guy, the guys, it's a fucking tank of a man. Brock Lesnar, perfect example guys takes off. How many years have you take off? Like five years. At least six years at least. He fights Mark Hunt, roids or no roids, whatever the fuck he tested positive for or anti estrogen blockers or whatever. You just forget about all that. The fact that this guy was able to fight mark fucking hunt after five or six years of no fighting, just doing pro wrestling and then when that's insane,

Speaker 2:          01:48:09       you know, I had had a bed in. I'm Mark Hunt and you had told me and I didn't know that I told you I'm casual. I'm a casual fan. I took Mark Hunt but I didn't know anything about it. And then uh, he walks out and I'm like, Oh shit, this motherfucker, he's built like me to add a cash back. So I did not go on in my book, My online book. This is before the fight stopped. I'm trying to bet on a brock lesnar real quick. Oh, that's already taken the bad data. That was like, Oh man, I didn't bet on this guy that's built like me Brock Lesnar. See, here's the thing though. That's not necessarily true. I know is that necessarily true, but that was my instinct at the time, like, oh no,

Speaker 3:          01:48:53       what brock lesnar did in a taking down the amount of time off and then beating a guy like Mark Hunt, that's so extraordinary and he's probably never going to get the credit that he deserves because the fact that one, he was a pro wrestler and then two, he tested positive for this anti estrogen blocker. Whatever the fuck he took. I don't know what happened. Who knows? It could've been. He could've been easily been some performance enhancing formula that he bought from GNC or it could have been something more insidious. Whatever the fuck it was. The fact that this guy was able to beat Mark Hunt after all those, that time off just shows you what an amazing athlete he really is. There's no way in hell that certain guys are going to catch up to that guy if that guy just keeps working out. Like there's guys that like if they just keep working out and they stay healthy and they stay fit and they get into the healthy and fit with no injuries, which is like the primary.

Speaker 3:          01:49:50       That's just like you. There's certain guys that you like, you're in a, you're in a world of shit. If you get a guy like brock lesnar into the ring with you and he's not her and he's in great shape and he has no injuries, you're in a world of shit. You're standing in front of a Goliath of a man. A guy was a struggle to die it down. Two hundred and 65 pounds. Yeah. It's not fair. What about cm punk? Is he good? Is he making his debut? He's making his UFC debut, but I have to respect that. He did a lot of things the right way. He went to Duke Roufus, his camp in Minneapolis. Milwaukee Rather. Excuse me. You go to right now. There's a lot of stuff in albuquerque. Yeah, there's a lot. No, no. He went to Milwaukee because that's where duke is it.

Speaker 3:          01:50:39       What he did was he went to one of the best gyms in the world, the roof, his sport. He Dick. I'm his brother. I'm Rick Rufus, who was like a world champion kickboxer that used to be on Pka karate and then there's Duke Roufus do group as a world champion more tie fighter and he's produced like a ton of worldclass fighters like Anthony Pettis, Sergio Pettis, Tyron Woodley. Does is tracking down there. He's the new UFC welterweight champion, so duke roufus is just like a really high level camp and that's where cm punk chose to move his camp and he, he lived there for like two years. They always been doing this training was signed with the UFC and he just said I'm going to do this the right way. And he went through a full, like a, like a long period of training, learning skills and working under the tutelage of like one of the best guys in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:51:26       Oh, who the fuck knows what's going to happen? We really don't know. I mean, I have no idea what this guy can do. I've seen him hit some pads. I've seen some slow motion, weird blurry videos of him sparring. I don't know. I mean they might be trying to shield it for promotional purposes. I mean, he might've gotten really good. He might be like, I mean, if the guy's willing to do that, that's an extraordinary amount of discipline that it takes to move to a place. Change your life. Lived there for two years. Just nothing but train. I mean, who the fuck knows? But that's the big. The big statement is who the fuck knows? So if you go to watch him fight, it's like you're tuning in for essentially like a spectacle and it might be great and it might. I mean we, we have to see.

Speaker 3:          01:52:09       He doesn't even know. We don't know if he's ever fought. We don't know. No one knows. No one knows what the fuck's gonna happen fall with the people that either. That's a different thing to do. There's a big difference. There's a big difference between training and reality and you know, and maybe he excels. There's people who excel at reality where they, they look lackluster and training and then they rise to the occasion of the event and then there's other people that are exact opposite what a practice. Well, and then yeah, the anxiety of performance is real, right? Everybody is just. I was, when it was a point

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       during the, a Ds, Mcgregor fight when the crowd started chanting, like they were in a clench or something in the crowded des Des des. And I was just like, what is he thinking right now? Like, what does that feel like? This dude is in the clench is a huge fight. The headliners lunch streaming down his face. What is his pants off? What does he feel like, you know, with the crowd chanting. I'm like, what is that like gladiators shit. Like, like, does it help? Does it, is it distracting? Does it hype you up as they chat? And uh, it's just, uh, it's just the, you know, I'm just a real good question. It's something I'll never, I'll never know. And it was something. Hopefully. And, and, and you'll find out on my podcast next week and I'm starting, I'll be interviewing a ideas and uh,

Speaker 3:          01:53:43       man, it's a good question in, he's the only one that can answer it or him or anyone else has experienced that. Right? Because you're talking about, you know, at this new t bumble what did, how, how many people isn't seat. I think the t mobile is like 22,000 or so. Really? It's a big ass place. It's way bigger than the MGM. I don't know about how much, at least a few thousand dollars because it's like, what is it Jamie sign?

Speaker 5:          01:54:08       Because it is. Yeah, people are chanting your name. Oh my God. But it's not like basketball because you just got, you've been punched in the face a lot so you didn't a little bit of pain. You might be hurting that kinda tired, you know, it's not just you, you, you know, just drop the three are soft and then you just jogging in the clinic. So it's like this is cool but I'm still kind of uncomfort

Speaker 3:          01:54:30       maybe fires you up. How many? Twenty, $20,000 for boxing and MMA. Oh, that's so many. That's a lot of fucking people. So that's approximately 5,000 more than the MGM. Mgm. About 15,000. Somewhere around there I think. Is that why they moved them there? Because there's more people. It's just a different deal. I don't know, you know, I just think they could sell this out to 16. Oh Jesus. The mgms that big. Wow. Oh, so is it Mandalay bay? That's 15. Is that what it is? Or is that 14? What am I asking? What am I fucking census taker. You're going to stop answering questions. Booking agent. What does it hold? Wealth thousand. Oh shit man. Lay based. Only 12,000. Hmm. Interesting. So, uh, I guess the reason why they moved it was just the UFC could sell out those places now, especially for this fight. This fight was gone.

Speaker 3:          01:55:24       Damn button. That was amazing. You could, uh, you could have stuck a light bulb in your mouth and it would've started glowing. Right? It was electricity in the air. I was going through our fingertips. It was, it was crazy, man. It was a good time. That's why I decided to keep, uh, working for the UFC. It's moments like that. The Nate Diaz Mcgregor fight. The first one was one of the in the Misha tate. Holly Holm fight me. She choked Holly Holm unconscious in the fifth round. It was fucking chaos. I remember thinking, how could I stop doing this? How could I. I can't believe I even got this job in the first place. I get to watch this crazy shit and talk about it from the. So you wouldn't know when they bought it. I wasn't sure. I just was thinking I was doing too many things and then I decided bombs just instead of just being crazy launch, do less. I'm just going to do less and doing less. It just made a big difference. Vape pen use after you have a man. He's just got punched in the face of folks. Relax. Should be. You should let him use it immediately after it just, let's be scientific about this. We all want everybody to be on the same page. We don't want people cheating. You know, if this guy, you watched him fight five rounds, there's no more contest coming up. Let him do something that's medically proven to reduce inflammation. It's not even marijuana. It's CBD oil.

Speaker 2:          01:56:44       Also. Those punches up probably way worse for him than CBD oil. Oh my God. It's CBD lungs. Good for you. Yeah, exactly. Especially when you have inflammation. Yeah, exactly. Should be nate diaz get punched in the face before he used cbd. That's a really good point, man.

Speaker 3:          01:57:02       It is a really good point because for someone to be that hypocritical that you let a guy get punched in the head for 25 fucking minutes, but you won't let them smoke a vape pen because what you think is cheating is cheating. Death as

Speaker 2:          01:57:14       will stay alive. Sadly with football, he uh, he was smoking marijuana. Football. Football is way worse for you. Then we'd is worse for you. And probably football is worse than cocaine. High hip flag football.

Speaker 3:          01:57:28       Yeah. Football is probably worse for you than most stuff. Drinking out of ponds. Footballs. Fucking dangerous. Super Dangerous Man.

Speaker 2:          01:57:41       But they just let it try to maintain a good image about it. But I don't smoke weed, don't smoke weed, but you might get Hella concussions, but don't smoke weed because that doesn't look good for because we gotta sell this. But like, I love the word hello, but I'm too old to use it. I just turned 49. That's what the cut off. Just do it man. You can say hello. Say Hello. You're just encouraging me to say to tell that girl asked her what her dreams were. Hannibal's

Speaker 3:          01:58:10       you know, you, you, you pumped him up, he pumps you up.

Speaker 2:          01:58:13       You're telling me as the girl with a dream I really wanted to ask is so bad. She had that vibe. Man. I see a lot of bad ones. Her vibe was crazy and they might not have. And I wish I took the shot. Yeah, I would've helped her with her. Whatever dreams my. If I had, if I could. What do you want to do? You want to. I can. I know somebody like that and you could find some money. If you don't know somebody finds her mind. You can find something. I wanted to because she wouldn't be hard to find somebody. I'm going to go, or you know what I

Speaker 1:          01:58:41       did, I did think about, I'm a, I saw it. Her name was on the receipt. Google her name and uh, the restaurant name and see if she got a linkedin page. Linkedin doesn't have a linkedin page. You sound like super rare, but hey, she seems like a waitress were way bigger. Ambitious man in La or New York actually more than Vegas. Yeah. It's gonna be hard because you're going to have to take a gamble whether or not she's still working there, whether or not you know what day her shifts are on Saturday, Sunday I went back, I was there two nights, two afternoons. Really stalkerish, but we ain't say no place where you say no that stock was, but I do. I did a enjoy her energy and I would help her. I say go back. I would help her in a platonic go back in a zen way, like completely empty to go back and experience like sitting in her section and uh, you know, just saying hi.

Speaker 1:          01:59:47       Yeah. Seeing what's up but don't, don't be like crazy about it. I wouldn't be crazy about it, just say, hey, I need this. I need to have A. I've been to vegas a bunch of recently with no shelves in Vegas, not even just to. I've been to the past to ufc things and then sometimes I just another trip just to kick it to fun place. It's a strange place. I was just in this area outside of Reno. It's um, we were about five hours outside of Reno. We were camping and doing this, a hunting show and uh, it's all in the mountains and the desert above Nevada. It's somewhere in the area of where they do that whole burning man thing. Okay. Dude, it was amazing. Who was, who I was. It's me and a bunch of a camera people and this guy, Steve Rinella poster show the media we struck out, but we were out there in the mountains above Nevada to food.

Speaker 1:          02:00:49       There's a whole other world out there. It doesn't even look real. I can just, it doesn't look real. You go to this place. There's no people. It's just giant fucking mountains. They go up to like a Louis. We were at 9,000 feet. There's other ones that go up to 11,000 feet and you're looking at these things like, what the fuck? This is Nevada, Nevada, these fucking. That's a picture from my instagram. That's, that's Nevada dude. That's the Nevada desert. That's the what's called the high desert is, like I said, about five hours outside of Reno was amazing. Oh, this was a. This is what you, uh, is the hunting trip? No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was there for. I was there for a week. It's a, it looks crazy. I think we could fail. You appreciate how that looks

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       and I appreciate how that feels, but I think I'm such a city dude where I get to that. Like, this is beautiful. This is cool. I have a couple of drinks and a check this out. All right. Five hours. We good? Let's go back to the light.

Speaker 3:          02:01:54       I understand. I understand that, but I liked the views. However I get antsy, but you zen out smooth. I could get antsy too. I think I'm what I'm trying to do. One of the things I'm trying to do by going to these places and disconnecting for a few days is find out what I really think about things where it's just me and my thoughts and interacting with my friends. This is one of the good things about doing this show. It's called media. This Guy Steve Rinella, who's the host of it is like a really smart, really nice guy, really interesting guy. And um, you know, I like hanging out with him and all of his crew and his friends for like all these days. So it's really fun. So in doing that and having it being really fun, you get to relax. Yeah. And you get to just sit back and hang out with these fun, cool guys and just relax and this is your world now. This is your tribe, right? You know, and he told me that before, that had that sort of how he views it like that, it, that it's his tribe and a cool group of friends and that now I understand it now. It's like it's a, I think that disconnecting for awhile. Every now and then just take, take a few days off just you don't even have to go anywhere, but it's probably a good idea too to like on purpose take a few days off of anything coming in and just let's see how you feel about things.

Speaker 5:          02:03:11       Even if I'm out and about at bar or something and my phone dies and I'm not charging it. I find myself having a fine. I realized I'm a really strange person when I talk to people when you get, when you have to really talk to people for awhile and it's not because now pretty much a lot of time if you talking to somebody is about you talking about and then as I do

Speaker 3:          02:03:37       phone and so it's a break a break from the connection

Speaker 5:          02:03:42       we're using and everybody. But if you really. I mean sometimes I mean on a date or something, I don't go into my shit. So really important point. But yeah, if my shit's dead and I'm just out for two hours, I find that if I'm having long conversations and then I started realizing like, Oh shit, I'm getting kind of weird and intense with this person. And I started asking because I, you know, normally I will if I'm talking to somebody or I'll do the bullshit regular questions that we do, the way you go to college, you live here. Uh, when did you move from? How long have you been doing that? And uh, and then, uh, and then you, I mean, at some point if you want to read, you got to get beyond that conversationally.

Speaker 3:          02:04:31       Roughly we're talking roofers right on the same page. Yeah, I rufio girl. Eliminate now what are your favorite? See with imagination. What are your fears? Have you ever been hypnotized? No. It can be done. Yeah. Yeah, I believe it. I believe it too. I believe in respect to all the hypnotists out there on the road, killing it. Having people on stage doing goofy. Yeah. Have you ever seen a comedy hypnotist? You've already seen it live at it's crazy, right? Like you don't believe he used to come to my college? Yeah. Yeah. You don't believe it's real and then you realize, oh, it is real. It really does work. It works. Nobody was just do that goofy ass shit. No, it was just to do it. It works in some weird way. I don't understand it, but I got hypnotized. Escape. Vinny shoreman. He's like a mental coach.

Speaker 3:          02:05:17       He hypnotized me to do what is your go. Just wanted to see if there was anything that was holding back the way I was thinking like in my thinking in the most efficient and a logical way. Am I doing the most with my time and my not like, do I have any hiccups that I'm not paying attention to and the way I'm approaching life. So I wanted to talk to him about that. So I wanted to see what hypnotism really yet because I've been talking about something that I essentially don't have any really real understanding of. I just say, ah, I saw people get hypnotized at uh, you know, Frank Santos comedy show and I saw that. How did I find her? But you know what I mean? I found this dude, he, uh, he does, uh, hypnotism and mental coaching for MMA fighters. Okay. So, uh, it was interesting, man.

Speaker 3:          02:06:02       It was weird. It was like a. When you get hypnotized, how long is this session? Sorry. That's about an hour and a half. About an hour and a half. When, when you get hypnotized, you are aware that this person is talking to you. It's not like you're in some space world, but the world that you're living in with your eyes closed in this state is a very different world. It's like if this person can command your attention, your focus for a certain amount of time, it lets all this other stuff sort of passed by and when the person does it with no judgment, just trying to understand the way you're feeling and thinking you allow yourself to slip in to this strange state of mind. That's what it is. It's really weird. Like it'll wake up immediately. Like if, uh, if you heard like an alarm going off, like it's not like you're drugged, but it's a, I think there's a bunch of different states of consciousness leading from the dream world, which we all voluntarily go into every night when we go to sleep, we go on, go to sleep, we conk out and we have dreams.

Speaker 3:          02:07:02       We remember them, we remember them, remember them all the time. We, you know, you have some wacky fucking idea that came into your head. Didn't make any sense. And I think there's states of consciousness from being totally awake fearing for your life because you're in the middle of an earthquake to being like drifting in and out of dreams. You know, where you're not sure you're there or you're not there and you wait. What was that? Real? What the fuck happened? You know, you're sitting in your car maybe at a road stop. You got a six hour drive. You're like, let me just pull over for an hour. He was drifting. You're not sure if your sleep.

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       Do you ever just close my eyes and just start seeing weird as colors and shapes and. Shit, not even hot. Yeah, but just I'll just close wise and then like now it's nothing but certain times it would just be weird shapes and just different.

Speaker 3:          02:07:55       It's pretty cold where your brain can make all kinds of funky chemicals man and they don't necessarily exactly know why. It's not like there's a bunch of different things that you can do to make your brain produce certain chemicals like in a row, like as far as like a, you know, maybe you can like skip rope for 20 minutes and do 50 deep breathing exercises and you'll get into a like a psychedelic state. No one's exactly sure. Like what the fuck it is that allows people to get to certain states and whether or not like the way your brain works is the same as my brain. Definitely. No, it doesn't make any sense. Why would it be like, we all know, like I hear people saying I can't fucking sing at all. I hear people saying and I hear like a beautiful voice like we were. We're walking by some people the other night in Vegas when we were on our way to go eat after the fights and then there was a this guy and this girl, they were saying they must have been a part of some team or something like that. They might have. It must have been some entertainers because they were way too good and they were saying it and they were singing with each other and they were singing with each other in harmony in this hallway and everybody was like, Holy Shit, because they just had a sound.

Speaker 5:          02:09:03       They made this the exact that appeal to everybody. That's something my wheelhouse here, but my. My brain is super sensitive to when sounds off and sometimes you go to a. If you go to karaoke spot, somebody doing karaoke and if they pick the rock songs and pop songs will sort of be the exact beats, the hip hop songs. The beats will have this. It's a different version of it or it it just and it drives me crazy. It's certain things with music like little shifts in music that drive me crazy. I hate when songs are a, I don't like when there's acoustic versions of gangster rap songs that makes. That drives me crazy sonically in certain just musical things that just pissed me. It just in that, in a. not in a good logical. It's just that type of thing where I'm like, I have to leave here. Yesterday by Uber driver from the airport, which I. He was playing his own mix tape. He didn't say he was playing his own mix tape, but I could feel that he was planning on mixtape because you played the same music for 40. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       The rapper name began withK , his name began with Kate on Uber and it was bad. It was really bad hit. The beats was already, but he's bad. He had no charisma on the mic and it was just. And so now I'm sitting here and I just decided I was going to take this. Just take it. Just take how angry this is making me because I don't want to give him the conversation because he wants me to be a. He wants me to say who's this? Anyway, that's me. Man. You're really talented. How long have you been rapping? So I pretend I made me and him. Um, how long have you been rapping man? Uh, I've just been doing it a, you know, just few years, man. Trying to get it going. So do you, do you, uh, do you play this in the car all the time and just listen to yourself all the time?

Speaker 2:          02:11:26       Yeah, all the time man. Just, you know, especially my favorite is when it's a 40 minute rides with somebody that just got through traveling for awhile. Yeah. Do how loud you playing this shit? I'm playing man. I'm pretty loud. And you know what the loudest is? A little bit less loud than that. That's how I play it. I feel you do this your car? Yeah man. Right. You know it was one song. The Hook was a don't do it. I'll just get to know you're talking about him. What'd he say? All black BMW. All black BMW was the hook. All black BMW. That was the word. And the hook isn't not the melody necessary because I didn't use any magic, but uh, we wouldn't have all black BMW. Oh, interesting. No Uber bars and maybe if he changed his cars, no lyrics or no lyrics about, but it was just, I was just sitting there like, what also I get that is la and I get that people are looking for opportunity and trying to make it.

Speaker 2:          02:12:30       How about you play me what you think your best one or two songs is? Oh wait a minute. You to say one or two, one or two you're going to be involved in a serious conversation. But this was swollen, but I made right out from my grandmom's died. No, it's like, you know, I was hanging out and I was like, fuck this life. So I wrote the song. Not the bad stuff, but I feel like that should be. If that's what, if that's your songs, if that was me, that would be my perspective on a 40 minute ride. Hey me ask you this. What if a guy plays you these two songs and they're awesome and you're like, Holy Shit, this is really good. Yeah. Then we'd do what do I do? Yeah. Maybe say, uh, in the car and when he tweeted out like this dude, motherfucker, uber drive, ask them go fast music.

Speaker 2:          02:13:23       Hey. Plus again. Uh, and, and try to push that. If it's amazing and I am and I genuinely feel it and if it's something I want to hear getting because that's the hallmark of a great song for me. If I got to keep listening to this overdose, frank ocean just dropped a new. He's dropped his new album. Finally. There's a song solo on there and it's just a simple Oregon plan. He's just, he's singing sorta saying rapping and it's a bunch of good songs and I haven't, but I can leave that on. I, I, I, I'll listen to a song. Yeah. 15 times in a row. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. It's not a lot of things like that. Like movies definitely aren't like that. A comedy definitely isn't like that. No. But there's something about songs. I'm certain somebody though, some stuff with comedy with me, certain timing moves that people do certain bits.

Speaker 2:          02:14:17       I will rewind a moment. People, my ex girlfriend, she might have, she tolerated but she probably hated it. It will be certain things like a quick, a weird thing in a show and I would just bring that shit back. I will bring that, our riding that shit. Yeah. 10 Times. That's what dice clay's career was kind of built on is that people wanted to hear the same things over and over again. What's in the ball bitch. Oh, the whole audience would be screaming it. It was like one of the first times where was a firm yet. But this type of shit, our wine is not our wine. Our wearing a facial expression like a cut to and somebody's making weird and if it's right, if it's done well directed and with our and that type of shit. Just a weird line. It was stuff off of uh, Maria Bamford show lady dynamite moments off of that.

Speaker 2:          02:15:10       It was this moment where they broke the fourth wall with a patent Oswald talking to her about, uh, doing standup on the shell. He was playing a character. Then he broke and then that moment was so crazy shit like that with our just is certain lines. Bojack horseman has a bunch of Shit with Algiers. I will watch the same moment 15, 20 times just because I just think that little part is fun. In the same with rap songs and certain rap songs where there'll be a 22nd 32nd piece. Yeah. With the dude is just wrapping his ass off and I'll just, I'll listen to that for five, 10 minutes straight. Just like that part. I still, I still like the whole salt, but it's a part of it. Yeah. The drop the drop on father stretch my hands by Kanye West. Uh, the, the buildup to that, it's a, it's just, you know, he sampled this Gospel Song with the same side of father stretch my hands and then there's the sample by future way. Like, well if your mentor don't trust you and it drops in, that's what I walk in. Like it's a crazy and I'll just listen to that if I'm driving around. I just listened to that first part like five times and there's a certain. I just like, I don't know. I don't know. Is that like a

Speaker 1:          02:16:31       normal thing? Hunter Thompson used to do that. When he used to write, he used to listen to the same song, like candle in the wind. He was still like Elton John Candle in the wind. There's a video of him doing that. He's sitting in front of the typewriter and he's just writing in the same songs, playing over and over again out of loop. I've tried it before too. I flew from New York to La writing the entire way, listening to crazy train by Ozzy Osborne cable was out of this shit. I want to know. I was like in a groove, you know, I don't remember what I came up with, but I remember feeling like because the song, I knew what the lyrics were. It almost became like a sort of hypnosis zone. Five hours of the same lyrics over and over and over. The whole five hours. I just listened to crazy train and I typed up, had some coffee, took a leak, which I got to do right now. Bad. My second podcast in a row. I want to keep going with you, but I got to Piss so bad james. Ask them questions to animal. Going back. I'm just going to freestyle rap. Hey, you know what it is?

My whole personality changed just because you left. I was like, Oh shit. Pardon me? Takes that as a compliment that you're so comfortable. You can be yourself when you hear. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       It was just. It was more just. I don't even know that. Yeah, it's just. I just get hyped up. I didn't say anything of substance either. I could have given 100 of my 800 podcasts. I could have a $800 is a lot more than I think it's like, what is this one says? Eight 36 could have given some good advice. I could have just, you know, talked about my mistakes instead I just plugged tour dates. That's a good move. That's the right move plug pto date.

Speaker 3:          02:19:59       People need to see you anyway and it's a Hannibal Montana Bowl.

Speaker 2:          02:20:04       The Hannibal Montana blue experience, and if they just Google Hannibal Montana, double goal. My goal, my twitter go on facebook, a

Speaker 3:          02:20:13       new instagram thing where you could take like a video of your day.

Speaker 2:          02:20:16       You do all the stories. I got to get a young person around me all the time. I can do it, but I don't wanna I don't wanna do that. I get the value of doing that. I understand, but I don't want to. It's the same for the same reason. Different, uh, different, different things that I didn't get pokemon go. Oh yeah. Because it sounded. It sounds fun. And what? A friend of mine, she had it on her phone and I messed up. This is fun, but I don't want to be on my phone that much. So I just got to have a, some internet savvy. Twenty five year old around me all the time. Mr Burns test be. I said. Oh Shit. I just said Internet savvy. Twenty five year old.

Speaker 2:          02:21:02       No, I hope. Make it a. What if she was so hot and you like, we can work this out so hot. Nope. Little ridiculous cartoon. Tiny waist in the ass. Like a fucking box of chocolates. Heart-Shaped Valentine's Day. Box of chocolate. What kind of assets that Jason does not fair dishonor avenue. Describe to someone an unfair recently and she's cool. She's likes. She's like, Hannibal, I don't give a fuck baby. I don't give a fuck. I'm not here for long time. I'm here for good time and you're like, let's do this. What are you talking about? He told my, my employee and longtime good sap. You gotta keep it. Yeah. Who Tonic plutonic. You got to keep it all. Work oriented. Some work oriented is 10 sessions. Times Professional. Yeah. Well, it's weird seat.

Speaker 3:          02:21:54       The idea of people working alongside each other day in day out, men and women, all group together in these boxes is entirely unnatural. When people would be around each other in the wild, they would do it because they liked each other. I am completely back in his day. Did I never lived in. Yeah. My obsession is in the genetic propensity that we have inherited from these people and I think that in the wild, men and women never like grouped up together. They didn't like each other but in work they do and it creates this weird tension

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       where management proved themselves and women are trying to prove themselves and no group pond back there. It's all about growth. It's groupon now, man. And you, you, you, you didn't get lucky back then. Like back then you just decided you're going to hang out with certain people and the other ones who killed. Yeah, right back there. It was no waiting it out. Now there's no way to know. Just waited it out late night and just hung out at the bar and in some got popping those, none of that. It was just either she liked you because you were just strong and you brought food and killed it. You see them like you at out. You develop the first catapult tall towards the enemy or you will. Small Dude that she didn't pay attention to and then out of nowhere out of an act of jealousy and stepping up, you killed the big dude and he is small, but I guess he's the Alpha now climbed on top of his neck and took out a conch shell.

Speaker 1:          02:23:26       Now you just find something you're good at and the cliffs, the people in the fucking boats, they let their torches up. You find something you're good at and you work hard and you can get women from net. This trick shot pool players didn't get Hella Pussy. Damn. That should be another meme trick shot pool players. Hello Pussy. There's a world where everybody mouth there is for sure. Well, there was always like a pool player groupies that would, uh, girls who were really good at pool. That would date dudes that were really good at pool. Yeah. Yeah. But dudes that really good. Could it pool? They think it will translate. Nah, it's not even that man put the ball in that hole that he could put his balls and weighted balls. Shit all talk. But I think a couple of my podcasts ball talk by Hannah Ball. I like it.

Speaker 1:          02:24:21       I am starting a podcast. Are you for real? Yeah. Would I be on it? Of course. It's going to be a road podcast and we'll see if that continues. Let's do a gig together. Let's do a get together on this tour that's. Do a gig together. Tell me when. Man, let's hop in. Let's start with Kalamazoo, Michigan. Holy Shit. Listen man, I would be very happy to do a Gig with you. We have a lot of time. A lot of good times. Yeah. You know, man, it's one of the crazy things about the comedy store is that we all get to hang out together. We're, we never would really work together that much in real life. Like if you go on the road, you take a dude with you to open, you know, everywhere we go, we take people with us to open or we have a local guy that we know we have come on, we never get to be all together. You can go to the comedy store any night. It'd be like you and D as in Burger and res is. There's no place like that. Man. It's fun, man. I love watching Rose Battle, the comedy store. It's the greatest thing ever. I love. It's just a, the energy in that

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       room. [inaudible] little ass belly. Rome hunted some people. It's packed in there. They got to keep it in that fucking room to fight it off. Just fight it off. No matter what they say about that main room. Togo in there, that's not the place. It's not. It's not the place for it. I mean, I went to the TV taping in Montreal. Oh, you got some feelings about it. How did you feel about it? I just feel about it. I felt good about it. I enjoy it. I mean, I enjoy. I'm also biased because I've seen it. I think my first time there was maybe two years ago, right close to that in the belly room. So, and, and, and I've seen even within the belly room, different things they've done to the show in that just different things with the djs are with the wave, with the, with uh, with the racist over there and tweaks that they've made in there to make the show work.

Speaker 2:          02:26:20       And so to see something that you've been to a bunch of times in this small space and then see it, you know, be in the beat in the same spot, watching it live. It's, it's cool to see something like that, to see that type of progression. It felt, it felt amazing, man. Just tell her mine, I like it better now. Do Madison Square Garden. But yeah, the space always has to be to be right in this, uh, it's uh, it's different. That was like a motivational speech for expanding your theater side. Yeah, that was really strong. He was, it is. So it was just, it was cool to see that. And it was. Yeah. I don't think I've had the, I've seen that with a comedians or friends of mine, that type of progression from, you know, over Micah to middle atrophy, Jack to somebody, you know, being on shows and being famous, but I never saw that with.

Speaker 2:          02:27:21       I can't think of. I saw that with a show concept. Maybe have a couple, but just something I attended regularly to see it go from a live show and go there and enjoy it as a live show and then, you know, have it be live on comedy central. That was something cool. I enjoy watching that now. I was really happy for them. Yeah. No, I, I completely agree. All jokes aside, I mean, I think, uh, what they've managed to do by getting that show on the air, it's pretty monumental because there's a god damn brutal show, right? Yeah. What's the devil webpage up to comedy central website. They have a webpage for that show. Are they going to do a bunch of them? I think they're going to do it again. [inaudible] dot com slash heroes. But we see it. Can I see what the page looks like? Who's the champion? Michael Lawrence. Mark Lawrence. You know my, um, yeah, I know him from the store. I've seen them around. Great. He's super funny. Super great writer to have all four episodes up for free. You don't even have to have scroll down a little bit. Go in and have

Speaker 5:          02:28:22       the bracket. Yep.

Speaker 3:          02:28:24       Now how many different hosts are they going to have? What are they going to do for

Speaker 5:          02:28:28       the host is always is Jeff Ross and uh,

Speaker 3:          02:28:33       yeah. Brian Moses. Moses who is awesome by the way. Probably Moses. I'm so happy for that dude. He such a good dude so they're not gonna fuck with it. So it's gonna basically be in the same state that it's always been in sort of racist. They can have the racist. See, here's my only feeling. This is my only feeling. I don't have a problem with them doing. I don't have a problem with anything, but I wouldn't suggest them filming those shows. I would suggest them doing those shows at filming. The family room shows there is a. there's a world in that room when when someone's killing, like when earl came out for that rose paddle thing and just destroyed. Remember that night he came out with a fur coat on? We did you see that on comedy central? Do they filmed it and it was. It was a magic because there's 90 people in there and they smushed slight scar sardines packed. It's a vibe in the EU, you everything has to be in line when you're killing, there's a frequency you have to hit and earl was just on that frequency and when you see someone do something like that in a small room, you realize that's the value of the smaller room. Yeah. What a small room is. Is that. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:29:42       yes. This is a video of those guys,

Speaker 3:          02:29:44       but when, when you're in a small [inaudible], when you're in a small room like that and you just let it all hang out, there's a weird fucking energy that there's a weird connection to that. It's different than anything else. It's way different than a big place, like a big place as nice. It's beautiful to be there. It's cool to be a part of like 10,000 people came to see Rose Battle. Yay. So, but the best show is that 90 seat belly room or 80 seat, whatever the fuck it is. Fire codes.

Speaker 5:          02:30:13       One of the best jokes I've heard there, I was, I could remember this comedian's name, but it's Ah, you know, you have a, a joke does new. That sounds like it's from the fifties or sixties. They just instructure and brevity. This, uh, this guy, he says that his girl, he says she's in an on and off relationship. Whatever boyfriend is on when he sees her body off when he sees her face. Oh Shit. I like that you. Because I'm like, that sounds like. It sounds like you heard it before, but you didn't. I haven't heard it before. No, I never heard it before, but it's short. I sound like I sound like some old shit. Your uncle would say we never. That was a fucking. You know what I mean? I've heard many great jokes that. But that one just stuck in my head.

Speaker 3:          02:31:12       They just found the eighth ever. Tyrannosaurus rex skull in Montana. That's right up there with that. People find sometimes and like, why

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       has no one found this skull? They just didn't know when I saw that combination of words. That's perfect. Uh, meanwhile there's some dude right now in the midwest screaming. That's my big, big motherfucking bed going crazy. Somebody might've come up with that and we don't even know. We just never heard it. They might be an open mic or that might've come up with it three solid weeks ago. Might've put it on youtube. We might be fucked here these days. Man. I saw a bunch of Ryan lochte. T jokes. Yeah. That dude's name. Take the same joke over and over and over again. It's. I was on twitter getting robbed. Yeah, about him lying. Yeah. Yeah. Like now it'd be a good time to rob them. I saw that. Like for like everybody, everybody would think that. Did anybody do jokes about getting his sponsorships? Endorsement deals that seemed like either get dropped.

Speaker 2:          02:32:09       They dropped, they dropped a bunch of them today and so part of me that he won for a body hair removal one. Wait a minute. Okay, so they look them for people. So shout out to speed up speed speedo. First of all, speedo. Hey everybody that wants to wait. Your Shit isn't in great shape. So how about you look at me. Animal Birds. That's a good point. Successful Samsung representative also got some other stuff coming up. That's where a lot of things, many irons in the fire. I have a horrible lifestyle. Horrible health, great skin. I look great on camera. Good smile. Speedo. People like me. I let people in the eyes when I talked to them and shake their hands and I always look in the eyes when I do shots towards neon orange, speedo speedos. Who else did Ryan lochte? They lose anybody else to run like the law.

Speaker 2:          02:33:02       Also, first of all, I've been in Brazil. Never had a problem. First of all, he shouldn't have lied about that. It would seem like something he didn't need to lie about De. Also fuck swimmers being celebrated like that. Oh, I like it. That just celebrated. Knows. I wish to like walkers would be celebrated. I wish we could figure out what is walking. Who can walk the fastest Walker, who can celebrate it all? Stay alive. Who's swimming? We could have a hold her breath or Olympics where people hold their breath the longest. Let's do that too. To have like a swimming. It's too many strokes to throw rocks. It's too many strokes. The furthest row strokes I respect. I respect this. Whatever. This is the regular. I respect this. What is the regular. I don't even know what it's prevalent, but when you get into this freestyle, when you get into this, I can't fuck with the.

Speaker 2:          02:33:53       Okay. For the people that are just listening regular as you're throwing your arms over the head like you see in the. When you're doing your shoulders with the goofy shit and swimming like that. The the fly struck the breast stroke, breast stroke. Nobody cares that Michael Phelps got 22 gold medals. Yeah, but a buzzard of we're swimming like a goofy ass hole that nobody slips. Like get Outta here. He's not the greatest Olympian. He's swims and water. Damn, that's a good point. That here's what the good point. Someone shit themselves. How many times you got to swim away from danger. One of the walkers shit themselves. How often do you have to swim away from danger? You might save a couple of laps. Usain bolt, he goes save some lives. He can run fast in there. I got I got out or somebody is attacking them. I'm out of him. You're saying but. But you, you, you usually not around water like that to get away from danger. Hm.

Speaker 3:          02:34:47       Well, here's the point, like why so many strokes? Why limit the way you move? Like if you're going to swim, like why do you have to swim at a very specific way? If this breast stroke thing was so fucking good, would it be the fastest way to do this? Why don't we. Let's. Let's pretend. Let's pretend this is the only shitty way we know how to swim. Let's just fucking throw our arms in front of ourselves like we're part in the curtains, like those beads at the porno section of the video store before there were dvrs and and dvds and you. Pardon

Speaker 2:          02:35:18       how those days, they going to have the fucking breast stroke. They don't have this stroke. If they don't have this, then why not just have a fucking Olympic competition where you just run, but you hide me and the whole time too. Very good. Passionate. Let's have backwards running. If you've got the backstroke wise, there's no backwards running in the Olympics

Speaker 3:          02:35:36       from now on, we should call that that move the porn section. That is you partying. The beads that are hanging. I bet when they fucking. When when video games went under or excuse me, a videos video rentals went under. I bet the bead industry dropped substantially. I've been a big part of their profits was beating off the porn sections. I'm dating myself here, but you guys don't even understand. You guys are both young guns. When I was a boy, when I was a boy, you could rent videos and you could rent porn videos. That's how I going go to the get drunk and leave for me for one minute. Drunkenly Oh, when I was kid, Hannibal burress can't handle his bladder. I guess I hung in there. Folks. I did my best, but Louis Theroux during that podcast with him for three hours and then I have some water, like an asshole in between. Couldn't hang in there folks. I'm so sorry. What? We're just talking about Jamie. Were you paying attention?

Speaker 4:          02:36:39       What? What?

Speaker 3:          02:36:42       God dammit. Olympics. Swimming. Swimming. Well, limiting your movement. Is it ridiculous? Like the idea that someone's going to say, okay, you can swim, but he can't swim at your best. Swimming some goofy way. That's not efficient. Go ahead. Try that. Because if somebody could just do breast stroke only versus a freestyle swimmer, they would never win. Right?

Speaker 4:          02:37:03       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:37:04       no way. Right? Why? Mostly Olympic events. Our events that we're looking at. Any way I'm confused.

Speaker 3:          02:37:10       Well, I'm a super big fan of curling, so I'm gonna tell you to fuck off. Right? You

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       ever watch that, like the panel will you ever see curling and years ago and everyone else got excited about it? The Winter Olympic sport. I was in a, I think it was newfoundland, new found land, Newfoundland for Gig. Yeah. Yeah. Great time. Nice people when long time ago. Yeah, no them for killed back Newfoundland recently to do it. I would totally do it. Oh, why haven't you done it to do weird shit. It's been. There's only a certain amount of your agents is filled up very quickly with metropolis areas. Have you been an ambassador for UFC Newfoundland? Point being. I tried erroneously to make fun of curling while I was in newfoundland because the, the, the stage always the place we were at how all these photos with people curling. So the dude with the broom and the dude with the fucking hockey, the giant steroid it out.

Speaker 1:          02:38:06       Hockey puck there. Slide across the ground. It's so good for you. So you try to run this meaning that tried joking around about it and they will not win it. Oh, oh. They loved it. They loved their curling. So yeah, I don't understand it, but I guess I don't have to. You don't have to. They like it. They like it. So as Newfoundland and we should go to the loo while you watch it for like an hour. So you kind of get compelled, like who the fuck's gonna win this thing? Yeah, stupid. That's booking gigs was baseball. Let's do it. Let's do Newfoundland. Okay. I'm in, but you know you're black, right? This man. Just kidding. It's Canada. Are they the nicest people on the earth or is it like Swedish people? If you ever been Sweden said that they met the nicest people. I think it's like the same way sometimes.

Speaker 1:          02:38:59       Sometimes it's southern hospitality. It is. Sometimes it's southern passive aggressiveness and they just talk horribly behind your back. Right. And that's like, um. Well I was talking about this with somebody recently that like, try to imagine the fact that 18, 65 when slavery was abolished was less than 200 years ago. Trying to imagine what 200 years is because it's only two lifetimes. Yeah. Two people being alive from birth to death. That's 200 years. So these people who are very healthy people, very healthy, very lucky people. I mean, so they're stuck in this probably net slaves, slaves. I live in the beat conditions aren't that exact, right? You don't have access to the, to anything. So it doesn't have the gluten free or to the slave. Slaves aren't getting the fresh pressed juice soda, you know, let's, let's cut it to maybe 60 slash 70. His foot slaves.

Speaker 1:          02:39:57       Yeah. If you're super lucky and that is only a short amount of time ago and no one understands that today. There's no we, we, we can intellectualize it, we can think about it, we can put it into our heads and try to figure it out. No one could figure that out today. And those, there's a lot of those areas of the country that are just poisoned by those old stupid ideas. There's just stuck in there, man. Yeah. In areas of the world, there's a lot of weird areas of the world that is poisoned by old stupid ideas. I um, I think we should do newfoundland. Fuck. Yes. I think we just shake off that shit. And Joe Rogan, Newfoundland, Newfoundland. Good. Let's do another one somewhere else. Like Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan. I used to sketch one in January when I get crazy. I met A. I met some Canadian.

Speaker 1:          02:40:47       I was in when I was in Minneapolis and they were like, you need. I think they might've been functional. Scattered while I didn't even like you need to cut because they worked, but it was some tourism fencing or something. You need to come to the Saskatchewan. Edmonton. I've done. I think that I'm due to do an Edmonton or Calgary on this tour to the river cree and the Edmonton. The casino. That is fantastic. That it's fun man. That's how fun fucking place. I like Edmonton, man. They're good people. They're just stuck in some weird spot that's like really cold for like four months of the year. But it's money, right? It's money. So you got these people? No, sometimes no. They just come out of high school and make six figures. Yeah, with their Canadian too. There's something about Canadians, like their culture does not support this.

Speaker 1:          02:41:39       Like, uh, the world domination idea that United States sort of has ingrained in us like we're the police of the world for good or for bad. Right? It's a lot of people think mostly bad yet, right? If the Canadians don't have this, they're not just trying to create a good life for themselves. Yeah, they're just people and uh, there's a real value in that. But there's also like this idea that the only way Canada would exist is if the United States is below it. Tacting it because this is such a fucking gangster. Yeah. Right. So that's the idea that I think makes total sense if you're looking at it objectively. But goddamn it makes for some Nice folks because Canada that they're like, I think maybe my all time favorite people anywhere. I think that the nicest people, those shows that I was drawing numbers in Canada. Good spots at 300, 400 seat spots easily before I was doing it over here. That makes sense. Even Vancouver, I remember doing shows in Vancouver, 2011 and Toronto played the Horseshoe in 2011 and then coming through first time just with like light credits and then getting it. Holy Shit. Then they come in to fuck with me. I couldn't. I first started doing it. You start hitting some splicing. What the fuck? I got people here. Yeah, and that's what Canada was when I started getting offers to help. I was thinking what is. It wasn't big money, but it was just

Speaker 5:          02:43:11       to have that. It was Vancouver. I forget the promoter's name, but I played maybe there. Rick Shaw, a horseshoe tavern in Toronto if five years ago and just be as shocked that it was that many people that it was psyched. It was, it was, it was just, it was. It happened earlier over there, man.

Speaker 1:          02:43:34       You know you gotta do in Toronto was me there. You've got to do the weed shop. What's that? We chopped show ever showed it, right? They have a front room where they sell bongs, rolling papers and share, and then you go in the back room and the back room doesn't have any error. It's all just pot smoke. You're breathing in pot smoke. There's no air, there's no air left. The light, the candles, candles on the table. They're all running on pot smoke and promises. There's no fucking era. That room, man, it's all just pot smoke and you get high before you go onstage and then you go on stage and it's preposterous. Everybody in a goddamn coma, it is train. Just comedy show you've ever done. Nobody wants to have. For me, this is what you need to do your regular show first and then head over to that place around 12:30 AM. He knew what I'm into because I do.

Speaker 5:          02:44:24       I like thc capsules. Me Too, and if it's because they met them because I get. I get so weird and in my head sometimes I can't unless I'm on, unless I'm a little drunk or a little on something else. I'm not able to enjoy myself high a lot, especially if I'm in a situation where a recognizable and people recognize if I'm high on weed and people recognize me, you're worried about. I get weird. It the fuck out. It's understandable. Billows my I will. I'm like, what am I doing? What is life? What choose whatever. What's going on? What do these people, why are they talking to me? Why did I do this? What did I do this? Do I just get. If I'm high, I'm gonna have. I just can't handle it.

Speaker 1:          02:45:13       We need to hang out more. Sure. Definitely, but it isn't a CIC capsules. I'm going to hold your hand. Figurative

Speaker 5:          02:45:21       CC capsules. I took. I went to a dispensary. Shout out to native roots in Denver and a smooth on that. Also maybe I think I. I think maybe the way I smoke, I shouldn't be out in about smoking is a. It should be just chilling, watching some shit, playing some video games, but my weed smoking never. I just never put it. If I can't create a situation with nobody can talk to me, then that's how I need to be high or the capsules, the capsules. I can talk to me a capsule, smooth me out and I started taking out this shit is shit is great and I feel good and I feel I can stand up on them. I

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       can't do smoke weed and do standup, but I can take a capsule and behind the stand. Hm. Um, do you know the difference between eating and smoking it

Speaker 1:          02:46:21       slightly, but I'm ready for this is a chemical differences, like a smell good. It's thc. You eat it. That would. The compound of the marijuana is processed by your liver produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite. Okay. It's way more psychoactive. It's like four to five times more psychoactive than thc. So you're talking about the capsules now I'm talking about anytime you eat it, eat it. I don't like edibles. If you're taking a capsule, you're eating it. You know what I'm saying? But it doesn't, it doesn't matter. It's like if it's. If it goes through your digestive tract and it's processed by your liver, takes a little bit about an hour or so, depending upon the dosage and how strong it is in, you know, whether you have a full stomach or. Yes, probably probably has something to do with it, but when it's processed by your liver, it produces this weird psychoed psychedelic drug.

Speaker 1:          02:47:08       It's very different than just regular. I don't know if it was a reason. The capsules I feel wasteful the than just swollen somebody's joint. Do you know how many milligrams are in those capsules? I think is is 10. Oh, that's good. That's a really reasonable dose and that's the good news about marijuana, like medical marijuana going nationwide as you can take a reasonable dose, 10 milligrams and it's therapeutic for your body. Feels good. You relax. Nobody gets hurt. Somebody to explain it to you. What? What it. That's what I mean. I wish I bought way more in Denver and also if you can just mill, I'll see you Monday. We'll hook you up. Relax. Don't say anymore to give you. You're going to get catfished by a cop. Bad Cop. Yeah, they're gonna, they're gonna do of those one book and you're going to be fake cops and was like, this dude's fucking Weirdo was going to be a girl with a tiny waist. Wastes like my wrist. Yeah. They don't like to do stuff like an explosion given people they met awful. They just want to fuck. They ain't had thought. Maybe that's a good point. Good point. That's hard. I have a friendly, thoughtful women aren't classically

Speaker 1:          02:48:23       beautiful. Wow. Believe you said that really hurts that. No, not a uh, one online. Thinking about my mom right now online. As far as somebody who's going to reach out to you that now the model is not going to reach out to you. Hey, what do you need that shit? Do you need something? Model Chick reach out and say, Hey, you want to hang out? But nobody's going to reach out like a model check is not reaching out. Hey, I got this asshole two fingers in the pussy grabbing like a fucking bowling ball. No. Yeah. They're not going to say, hey, you need this and when you, when you, they want to hang out, right? Yeah, they know. Say, Hey, you need a restaurant recommendations. Just good point. You know they used to

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       all the attention anyway, so he's just saying, oh yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. They just, they want to test the waters a handle. Burse ain't playing games ladies. Okay. Unless you're ready to go to def con four. You Ready? I got high standards mean to what I think I want kids, man. Do you know what age when you have your third or fourth hotel or they don't want kids? It's three years. Two to three years. That's a good move. I saw this pregnant woman on the l train in New York, but she was one. She was one of those was she didn't. She just looked like her stomach was bigger. It nothing else affect like perfect makeup. Just dressed nice in a nice dress. She had to have a wedding ring. I want it to. I just wanted to ask her if everything was okay if she was with a dude, like she was so beautiful. I kept looking at it. I know she felt me looking at it. I probably wit her out. She was so beautiful. I started picturing myself arguing with the real father.

Speaker 4:          02:50:24       Five years from now, I started pitching myself on the train, holding hands or there
