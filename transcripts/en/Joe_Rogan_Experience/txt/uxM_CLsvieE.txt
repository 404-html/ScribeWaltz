Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Five, four, three, two, one. Dr. Rhonda, Patrick. Hello. Hello. Welcome back. You've got a big fat book of notes over there. It's like it's something I use like before I'm giving a talk or something like that where I like to something about writing, handwriting things like helps me remember. Oh yeah, this, they've shown that I do that before shows. If you looked at my notebook and you think if you ever thought that I like actually wrote in my notebook, you'd think I'm a crazy person because I'm reading the same thing over and over again. Like all work. No play makes jack a dull boy. I just like before a set, what I do is I just write out the key things that I wanted to work on and I'll write them out over and over again. So like I'll have 100 page notebook and it's like 100 pages of like half of it's the same stuff over and over again.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       I'm Kinda the same way. Like I, I'll write out things like that are in more detail and then like you said, all like righteous, just like a cue, like it's different when you're giving a talk, at least like in academia, like a powerpoint talk you have to slide and this slide cues like a couple of minutes of talk. So you've got like, it helps you remember what you're going to talk about. Yeah, that would help for comedy. I bet. Probably a good idea. I should have a slide show, you know, like that would actually be a really good idea for like particular points where you could show that you weren't lying. Like look this is a real thing. You know, you have like a reference there because there's a couple of things that I'm talking about in my new set where I have to, I have to reassure people that I'm not making this up because it's so ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       You know? And I'm like one of them was this woman who proposed as a high school student. She was a 25 year old police officers, super attractive, and she poses a high school student and convinced a young boy to sell her marijuana and then arrested him. So it was just an experiment? No, it was a sting operation. Wow. And he was a regular kid. He was an honor roll kid. Oh my God. Now he's a felon. That is crazy. Yeah, there it is. Teen falls in love with undercover cop and marijuana sting gets arrested. Yeah. So this is one of them. I would love to be able to put that up and go see because you could. I guess you could just make stuff up if you wanted to know what comedians do. They make stuff. I mean you can a lot, but if you made something up like, Hey, there was a story in the news and just made it up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       That sounds crazy. I guess it. Who cares if it's funny. You know, people just come to laugh, but yeah, I guess you're right. People like comedians usually make up personal stories. Sometimes they say it's true and I'm like, it's so outrageous is really true. Like, I don't know because it's just so funny, you know, like some of the stories that, that some of these comedians tell when I'm just like, how can this be true? They said it was true, but it's like, are they my friend part of comedy? Can you do that? You definitely tell my friend Dom irrera has a really funny joke about that. He goes, he goes, he's a true

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       story. He goes, hey, how about you just make something up that's funny. You know, like it doesn't have to be true buddy rich. I can't say it's true. So it's Kinda like messing with you because the whole time they're doing, you're likely true because that's fucking hilarious. Sometimes it's true. Sometimes it's not. I guess it depends. Depends on the person. I assume everything in your notebook. It's true. I hope so. The other thing that helps me like said this, this helps, you know, writing it down helps me, but also there's the running running like helps. So actually this was very interesting because the study just came out not long ago showing that if you. So if you run the four, you're going to learn something and you want to like, let's say you want to like, you know, do something short term recall, so you're gonna go up on stage and say something, you know, say a skid or whatever, and um, if you run right before that, it improves the short term memory.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       So your short term recall if you run right before, whatever it is, you're quickly read over something and then you want to remember it. But if you are learning something and then you run after you learn it and then like the next day you want to remember it. So it's more of a longer term memory. It improves that. So it's like whether or not you're running before, after you learn it affects the short term versus long term memory. Wow. How did they work that out? That's bizarre. Well, it, it wasn't like they were testing for that. They just found it out through because they were just, you know, doing running before, after they're probably looking at just to see how it affects short and longterm memory recall. And they were surprised to find out this was a study that was done. Um, I can't remember where it was done.

Speaker 2:          00:04:36       I know I tweeted about it not long ago because it was like within this last month that it came out. So, you know, it's like if you want to, if you want to. So like while I'm, you know, learning new material throughout the day, then I go for a run in the evening and then the next day I'll be able to recall it better. Theoretically now I'm subject to the placebo effects. I know about this. I'm like, oh, that's a problem. I don't run normally, but I did a five k on Monday, like I don't run at all. But a buddy of mine had a five k race in Vegas. So I flew in for him and my friend Cameron Hanes and um, I ran it and it was surprisingly hard. Just like all the working out I do. So only three miles. It's like three point one or someone like her heart is a fucking hard.

Speaker 2:          00:05:20       It's not easy. Yeah. No. So do you do any like aerobic between kickboxing, Jujitsu and I do elliptical machine and I do a lot of yoga but doing, I'm trying to do yoga three times a week. I'm not always successful at getting there. I got there last week, three times a week. But um, I don't run so I figured. But all that stuff I do, I'm like, I'll have, I'll be fine. Nope, not really. So you didn't train at all, you just kind of like on the fly just did this five k and I saw, I saw you post something about this and I'm isn't, doesn't cameron? Isn't he like some kind of like crazy runner? He's preparing right now for the [inaudible] which

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       is 235 or 234 miles. Something crazy like that. And Jamie's a runner. So when Jamie shakes his head like that, you know, it's really gross. Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah, he's a nut. He did two. Oh five last year he did the big foot 200, which is 205 miles. Plus it has something insane like 55,000 feet of elevation change over the course of the entire race because you're constantly going up and down and up and down and at some points in the race it's so steep and the terrain, it's an outdoor race over Mount Saint Helens. So sometimes the terrain is so brutal that the top speed is two miles an hour or

Speaker 3:          00:06:37       he's going to be like one of those like amazing super agers like, like, like that. Just very mentally sharp when he's in, when he's older. Either that or he's not going to be, that's been shot like it's been shown. Like if you. Part of being a super ager, like being a super ager means your old but your, you're physically fit, you're mentally sharp and mentally sharp. Is, is really the key thing, you know, cause we start losing brain mass at like the age of 20 and by the time if you can actually make it to 100 years old, you lose like 20 percent of your brain mass. So they found that one of the keys to maintaining your brain mass is pushing past that comfortable zone physically. So like, you know, exercise wise and also mentally just, you know, obviously like, like learning new things and challenging yourself so you know, so when you're working out you don't do this kind of like, you know, half ass thing, you have to push yourself, you have to really push yourself and that seems to be key for becoming a super ager.

Speaker 3:          00:07:39       That's crazy than it works with your brain. Why exercise? I mean exercise has profound effects on your brain. I mean specifically if you're looking at, you know, a robotic aerobic exercise, a row, it's hard aerobic exercise as you said, doing a five k running three miles. I mean you do, you do a lot of training and yet that was still hard for you, you know, because during that type of aerobic exercise is difficult. Um, studies have shown that even just like 20 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise can, in healthy young men increase serum bdnf. So which is brain drive neurotrophic factor. This is a growth factor that is involved in growing new brain cells and in allowing the existing brain cells to survive. So, you know, talking about combating brain atrophy, you're talking about commenting that the fact that your brain is atrophying, starting at the age of 20, that's the way to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:08:32       Your brain starts to atrophy at 20. At 20 you start to lose brain mass. Yeah, I know. It's really frightening. 20, you start at the peak at 20. It was so stupid at 20. I'm so much smarter than I was when I was 20. No, I agree. I agree. I mean it's not necessarily like brain mass and intelligence. I mean, I don't know if you know that there's definitely a correlate but, but like when you start losing mass in your hippocampus, I mean that's memory learning, you know, that part of the brain. Um, but there's just so many studies showing that exercise roebuck exercise and also, you know, it doesn't have to be Arabic. You can do resistance training. That sort of stuff also affects the brain as well. But for me, like I've been a runner since high school and track I guess long a long time and for me, you know, I've done like a few races, I've done a marathon and I don't feel like marathons are my thing.

Speaker 3:          00:09:27       Like I felt like that was just really rough, you know, like it was. I mean I'll run three miles and I will feel challenged. Like if I push myself I can do that and that I feel like doing that a couple times, three times a week is plenty for me. But when I run, you know, for me it's my, I entered this like state of, of like daydreaming, sort of. I get creative, you know, when I'm going on a, like a three mile run, I'm just, I start thinking about things, um, if I have an important decision to make or something that's causing me some, some sort of anxiety, I go for a run. And I feel like I can address that issue better. And what's interesting is that there have been studies that have shown that going for a run, um, and specifically aerobic exercise, it activates the part of your brain and Bolt and executive function, which helps you make decisions. You know, it's, it's Kinda like that overarching part of your brain that helps with all the planning, long term planning, all that. And so I always, I do, I feel like if I go for runs and it's bothering me, if I'm anxious and I always feel better 100 percent of the time, like there's not a single time that I go for a run and I'm like, damn, I feel worse. Why did I do that? You know, it's like I feel, I feel like crap while I'm doing it. I'm like, Oh, this is. Well, I

Speaker 4:          00:10:43       human mind. I mean this is all just theoretical in my own theories. I think the human mind is designed to confront serious things like predators and dangerous enemies. And, and we don't really get much of that in this life. So when a person is dealing with stress, I think the mind is preparing for some things that don't exist. So even if you can work things out logically, there's still remains like this residual effect of all these human reward systems that are kind of in place when the time we really did have to have all those rules, those reactions in place to deal with, you know, a dangerous invaders or you know, horrible natural conditions, you know, whatever they would be that we hardly ever experienced any more. So like when I work out, if I have anything that's bothering me or troubling me, I think I get like a distorted perception of the danger of it or the physical real.

Speaker 4:          00:11:43       Like it could be something real simple. Like I have an issue at work that I have to deal with. Like maybe I have to make a decision or maybe you know, I'm stressed about something and I feel this no matter how much I work it out logically, I still feel this physical, like residual issue. And that issue only seems to be resolved for me because I don't run with hitting the bag. Like for me it's a punching bag, which is really hard to do. Like when you, when you do rounds, like kickboxing rounds on a bag, have a timer and I could set it for three to five minutes. It'll, it'll allow you to set it all the way down to one and then it has like intervals. So it gives me like 30 seconds. Every 30 seconds of Buzzer go off and it has two lights.

Speaker 4:          00:12:25       One light is yellow and one light is blue. And so the yellow light, I kind of a go at like 60, 70 percent. And then the blue light I sprint. So it's like sprint, try to catch your breast print, tried to catch your breath. And I do that for seven to eight rounds. And when I do that I don't give a fuck about anything after it's over. I'm like, who cares? Like it's amazing what it does because like my mind still has all the same data. I still understand all, whatever it is, like work related nonsense. I still understand all the issues about it and they're all, there's no new information, but now the information is coming into my brain and it's going, oh, this isn't a foreign invader. These aren't vikings that are coming over and have a fucking boat. That dragon's head at the front of it, swinging swords. I. This is just some nonsense, whatever it is, you know, agent issue or manager issue or tax issue or whatever the fuck it is. That seems so physically daunting before the exercise, but then afterwards when that aspect of the problem is alleviated, that stress, it's almost like my, our bodies are just like confused as to what these problems actually are.

Speaker 3:          00:13:33       I'm like, I love, I love your, your interpretation because it's exactly the way that I would like to talk about why we need this type of stress. I actually just like you said, I actually think that from an evolutionary evolutionary perspective that we were meant to be stressed. We were meant. We were meant to be out side either hunting, tilling the land for food, you know, to prepare food. I'm bombarded by UVB radiation, which is stressful. We were designed to have stress and what I mean by designed was we have genetic switches which are supposed to be turned on. These genetic switches that are activated by stress are supposed to be turned on and just like you said, we're in a building novel time now where we don't have to go outside, we don't have to till the land, we don't have to hunt for our food, we can sit, we can sit on the couch on her butt all day and order delivery or go to the grocery store and we don't have to eat foods with polyphenols.

Speaker 3:          00:14:41       Flavonoids are things that are also slightly stressful, you know, so this is kind of that concept before me says, but I like the way you explained it because I really agree with you think that humans were meant to be stressed exercise as a form of that stress. And there's different, various different types of, of that stress. Um, and I, and I think that we were supposed to switch on those, those genetic switches, those genes that are helping us deal with stress. So like, you know, like you said you have a problem and I'm the same way with my Ronald, have some something that's bothering me. I have to deal with whatever it is. I mean in my mind I blow it up and may not even be that big of a deal, but I go for a run with no new information with nothing new, you know, like I feel better. And I think that's partly because I'm switching on all these, you know, stress response pathways that helped me deal with the stress better. These antiinflammatory pathways, just all this really good, you know, these good genetic switches that are being

Speaker 4:          00:15:40       just switched on. So when it totally makes sense, I think this new time that we live in, I just don't necessarily understand that the body understands where the stress is coming from. I think you know, your body is a physical organism and nature is an absolutely brutal thing and it has been for us as well as for all these other animals forever. But now for us it's not really that brutal anymore. And so all these mechanisms are in place to protect you. And they don't get served and for me, martial arts is always been like the best one to deal with. Oh, we're weight lifting's good to like a good kettlebell workout does it too. But like the big ones for me are Jujitsu and kickboxing because Jujitsu is really, really hard to do and it's also you are solving problems. So I think Jujitsu serves two purposes.

Speaker 4:          00:16:29       It's incredibly grueling as far as like the sparring process of just rolling and competing with each other. Even in a friendly role. Like with a guy that I really like and we're laughing and we slap hands every time someone gets tapped out or whatever. It's so difficult. Like your, your, your body's taxed so hard and your mind is taxed because you're dealing with countering. You're dealing with setting up moves, you're dealing with, you're thinking several steps ahead and then you're. You're adjusting those thoughts based on whatever this person that you're sparring with is doing too. So people get really, really addicted to Jujitsu for all the right reasons. And one of the things that I've found as that Jujitsu people like for the most part, are way more mellow than most people would expect. Like way more chill about stuff like way less likely to respond to something in a DM or an imbalanced way because they whatever your body, whatever these requirements are that we're addressing, your body has all that in Jujitsu, but without the real real violence, you know what I mean? Like the ones trying to kill you, they're just trying to do this thing to you and you're trying to do that thing to them and those things mimic actual combat, actual real life and death struggle in a friendly.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       And it also has this camaraderie built into it too because you've kind of understand that you're going through this incredibly intense thing together and you also understand that it takes a unique person to go through that and get past all these psychological hurdles, all these physiological hurdles, and then you also are aware that this person understands like really clearly the kinship that you all share in having this experience together.

Speaker 3:          00:18:20       That's really, that's really neat. I kind of relate. I mean, not to the same degree, like what you're, what you're describing is on a whole other level. But um, I experienced something similar when I'm, when I'm out surfing, um, you know, it's, I'm, I'm getting the physical exercise, but I'm also like a tackling these fears of these big waves and getting pulled under and drowning and getting tangled with my court, you know, there's like a million and every time I do I always have that fear paddling out there. But I get out there, there's a group of surfers and we're all sitting out there and there is a sort of friendship that we develop out there because we all love surfing and we've all like, we know, we know. It's like, oh, here comes the wave. We're helping each other. Like, look, there's one on the outside paddle out, you know. So it's Kinda like I'm completely like a different level from what you're describing with Jujitsu, but still I kind of can relate a little bit,

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       you know, read. I don't know if it is a different level and a lot of Jujitsu people surf as well. I think there's like a similar attraction to it, but because also you're a monster dodger, like you're out there in the monster soup. Yeah, it's, it's, um, that's what that is.

Speaker 3:          00:19:30       It's crazy that I still haven't, you know, you'd think that after doing it for so many years that I would get over that fear, but.

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       So they're so powerful. Yeah. I mean, how can you get over that fear? I'm my friend, Shane Dorian is a big wave surfer and he's been on the podcast before and he's a big time Paul Hunter too. And we talk all the time about this and you know, um, the way he describes it is just, it's so attractive. Like, I wanna try it, but there's not enough hours in the day for me. There's not, I'm, I'm, I get too addicted to things and it's just. And I have a fucking real fear of sharks. It's real. Sharks are scary, scary or so. But they're real. They're out. Yeah. Oh Jesus. What is this? Jamie? Shane Dorian is big wave. Oh my God. My hands are sweating. Watching. He is out of his fucking mind. Totally. He's a legit maniac. Wow. Like that is what is how. How high would you say that wave is, Scott? To be 50 feet, right? Say It's in Hawaii. It's called jaws is the name of the jobs. Oh my God. Look at the size of that is so insane. It's so insane. Like losing my mind is when I see these guys big wave surfing like this, my heart starts racing. I'm so anxious. Right? God, it's so insane.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       That's more than 50 feet. Right. I would say at the very peak of it, it does look like it's more than a 50 foot faith now when it comes down to does it say there on the youtube thing, what it comes down on you? I mean, it doesn't really like that if it that, if that. If you got smushed, like if you fell and that came down on you, I mean you're, you're probably fucked. Right? That's the fear. Yeah. I mean damn. I mean the biggest way I've, I've ever surfed is like overhead, you know, like over time and a half overhead, so not even double overhead. So. And that was like, I had a couple of, um, scary moments where I was just tumbling during donuts and I couldn't find which way was up or down, you know, it's like I've had one time I was surfing out in this place.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       I'm in San Diego called sunset cliffs and it's a brief break and it's really hard to get out there so you have to like, time you have to like jump out when the after the wave breaks and then you paddle out and there's all these kelp beds. And I was surfing there this one time and this was back when I was really dumb and didn't wear a leash because it was like Alicia is, you know, I like to dance on my board and they get in my way. And so I didn't release. But um, I, I, you know, there was a big wave and I was writing it and I wiped out and I like got caught in the kelp. Oh Shit. And so it was like the sky, you know, you have this moment where you panic and that's really bad, like panicking when you're like in the water, cause panic takes like your energy.

Speaker 2:          00:22:11       And I panicked and I was because I thought it was going to die. I was going to suffocate kelp bed. So I remember having nightmares, I've had nightmares about it. Like that stuck with me. That was like, that was one of those moments that, you know, sort of traumatizing in a way. How long did it take to get out of the Kelp? I don't remember. I don't remember because it was just, I think the panic sort of just lost track. It seemed like forever to me. Like I don't know how long it actually took and of course I lost my board and I like swimming and I got cut up on the reef. Yeah, reefs are brutal. Brutal. Yeah. I actually stick to a beach breaks now, but I don't, like you said, I don't even get to surf that much anymore because I just don't have.

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       So people that when they surf breaks that are over those reefs. Like you just can't wipe out. If you wipe out, you're going to go right into all that Jag and shit. Yeah. It depends on where the reef is. Like, like I was riding the wave in kind of in more so I was closer to where the wreath was. But yes you can. It's, it's dangerous. They're beginners should not ever go out on a reef. And I've seen many beginners out there, but it's, yeah, it's definitely more dangerous. Feel the scratches and cuts. Yeah. Pretty, pretty, pretty brutal. But any shark encounters? No. I'm the only sharks. I've actually. Actually, I shouldn't say that's not, that's not actually accurate. I don't have any scary shark encounters. Um, I served for a long time in La Jolla and there's a breeding ground, therefore I'm leopard sharks, which are not

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       to be confused with tiger sharks. Tiger sharks are definitely scary. Leopard sharks are the ones that have the spots on them and they're really harmless. They're kinda like nurse sharks. Yeah. Oh, don't eat. They're not like, I really do like sand sharks. There's this around. Yeah. Yeah. And they're really cool to look at. But I've never had, I've never actually known anyone that serves in southern California that has, you know, with all the surfers that I've known that has had an encounter in southern California with a shark. Do you know people that have encountered them in the bay area? You. The Bay area is a big breeding ground for great whites. I would never surf there. Really? No. I would never say, oh, I would never surf there. Yeah. The sharks

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       look say yeah, the sharks. But they're all. It's all connected. It's like, don't go outside. There's a bad neighborhood somewhere. Will stick and move around. I guess just in my head, I was sort of like convinced myself that they're not, they're not coming to San Diego. There's a video of a drone flying over Malibu where some guy takes a drone and he's flying over the Malibu surf and he's like, the drone is like maybe a few hundred yards away from some surfers and you see a big fucking great white just swimming along, just swimming along and show me this video. Drone shark footage. So here's these people. They're all on this board. They came and were just southern California, new big deal, and when the drone keeps going further and further out, you see this fucking whopper shark that's not far away from these people will find it here. Jamie will find it. There's one right there. Where's this? Oh, nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       Oh, nothing. Just a shark right there. Right there. That's the fuck. Dammit. Joe. Don't show me this. You know, you're a smart woman. You understand monster soup. I try not to think about the sharks. Well, it's a gold look. There's two of them. Interesting book that surfer and two sharks. No big deal guys. That's pretty scary. Yeah, it's supposed to be scared. Just I know. I don't know. Apparently Catalina, that whole area outside of Catalina is a crazy shark fishing mecca where I have a friend of mine from Texas and he traveled to Catalina Island and he said it is the most savage stretch of water in all of North America. He said, it's just infested with Maaco sharks, and they go out there to catch me kosher are delicious. Mako sharks are really, really good to eat too. They taste like swordfish. That tastes amazing. Are they dangerous? Like they'll fuck you know, fight you, but the thing about sharks, now it's because people are so silly because of the awareness of shark fin soup, you know, because shark fin soup is the practice of acquiring shark fins is really brutal and not sustainable. All it's

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       really horrific and a lot of Asian fisheries engage in these unsustainable practices where they'll scoop up thousands and thousands of sharks cut their fins off and then throw them right back in the water so they waste most of the shark in order to get the fins for shark fish soup and so because they're trying to raise awareness of this now, people are getting really upset at anyone who catches sharks even if they catch sharks legally for food, because sharks are not endangered and as well as any in any more sense than tuna is endangered because tuna are in vastly diminished numbers than they were just a few decades ago. If you talked to anyone who's a commercial fisherman or even a a sport fisherman, if these guys that run these charter boats, they'll tell you like to use to catch way more tuna. It used to be way more prevalent. I think there was something that you addressed in that Jiro Dreams of Sushi movie as well, is that the commercial fishing is just brutalizing the tuna Martin, but yet everybody is still eats tuna and they don't think twice about it because this campaign against shark fin soup is made people like really upset at people that catch sharks to eat.

Speaker 4:          00:27:52       Even people that eat meat, it's like we're so simplistic in like are protesting and like people just have it in their head that I heard you're not supposed to eat sharks anymore. Like can you catch and sharks you fucking asshole. Like, like that is the one thing that you want to talk about like fish that don't do no harm to human beings. Like sharks aren't on that list. You know, in this, this is scary God damn animal and if you could eat that, I say Kudos. Kudos to you

Speaker 3:          00:28:18       because sharks are higher up on the food chain. Don't they have higher mercury levels? That's a good question because I know like swordfish, like I would not eat swordfish. Really? Oh No, no. Yeah. There is like, oh, I wish I could remember the amount. It's something like 150 micrograms per four ounces or something. So compare that to a wild Atlantic Salmon, which has like four micrograms. Whoa. Yeah. Swordfish. So the ones that are really safe to eat that I know of are the wild wildlands salmon, wild Alaskan, sorry. Analytic Wild Alaskan Salmon, cod. Um, let's see. White tuna is okay, but the albacore tuna has a little bit more mercury. I think it's like, you know, twice as much or something. But I'm old. I'm a little thinking that shark would be high on the mercury level.

Speaker 4:          00:29:16       That's interesting. I'd like to find that out because I know that people have had issues that eat a tremendous amount of Sushi. People that eat Sushi like every day. I know they have had issues with mercury in the past. I actually had an arsenic issue with sardines, sardines, or bottom dwellers, and I used to eat sardines all the time. I have, I love Sardi. Yeah, I love sardines too. And if you eat canned sardines too much, I

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       got some blood work done and the doctor was like, you have some significant amounts of arsenic in your system. I'm like, am I being poisoned? He's like, no, not, not that. He goes, it's not like someone's trying to kill you, but it is like a dietary issue. And then he asked me what I ate and I said, you know, we went through all my food. He's like, nothing else. I go, he goes, what about seafood? I go, oh yeah, I eat seafood. Oh yeah, I eat a lot of sardines. He was like, that's it. I didn't know. Sardines, uh, accumulate arsenic. Does that make sense? So I backed off. I didn't eat sardines at all for three months. Came back, the issue was completely resolved. Yeah. You know what I'm besides sweat, you sweat out a lot of these heavy metals like mercury, arsenic, um, garlic, some of the Beta mercaptans and garlic.

Speaker 2:          00:30:25       They key late, they bind and key late mercury and help pull it and excrete it out of your body through the urine. So like when I, whenever I make salmon or fish, which I actually do eat a lot of salmon, it probably like two or three times a week. Um, I always have fresh garlic with it. Oh Wow. That's amazing. And Salmon is outstanding to because it's so high in essential fatty acids strictly. It's really good for you. Exactly. Yeah. It's really high in Omega three fatty acids, EPA and Dha. So. And it's got a modest amount of vitamin D. whenever I'm sick I eat giant cloves of garlic. I'll just break it down to point where it makes me feel horrible. I'll have like a big glass of Kombucha and I'll take like a lump of garlic and I'll break off like four or five cloves and I'll just take off the skin and chew those bitches down and Chug it.

Speaker 2:          00:31:13       With Kombucha it's off, like sometimes it, it's painful as it's going down. Like my, my system is like, what in the fuck is this? Like, I could feel it inside my body burning. I love it. I've, I've done the same thing previously. I mean, I don't do that anymore, but uh, yeah, I mean garlic is very powerful. Antimicrobial compounds in it. So, I mean, that makes perfect sense. Lots of last time I did it, I went, I had to take a knee, a knee to knee. Really? Yeah. Like, I didn't actually go down, but what I did was I put both my arms on the counter and I went down like this, like, oh, because it was just burning, going down. I just was like, well, this is probably not even working. I'm just being retarded. No. Getting back to some of those like pungent compounds that are in these, these, these plants. I mean that kind of gets back to what we were talking about a minute ago with switching on those genetic switches that are meant to be switched on there. Man, we're supposed to eat these kinds of foods, garlic, Broccoli, cauliflower, Kale, these things that have that pungent mustard, you know, that, that pungent tastes. I mean, these things are, um, you know, various different polyphenols and compounds and one in particular I become obsessed with lately is sulfur fain and that's present in most of the cruciferous family, Kale, Broccoli,

Speaker 3:          00:32:41       cabbage, Brussel sprouts, Wasabi, Bok Choy, just, you know, that whole family of vegetables, pretty much. I eat those vegetables a lot, but I become very obsessed with this, this compound that is, it's actually sulforaphane refrains, not in the plant. It gets formed once you break the plant tissue once it's like chewed or crushed or blended or whatever, chopped somehow because it's stored as a precursor and then once the tissue gets, you know, chapter or whatever, uh, then it forms sulforaphane and that's part of it's, you know, hormetic response. It's, it's plant response to try to ward off insects or whatever thing. So that's, that's why it forms, but it actually, when we ingest it, it's a really, really, really good for us, you know. So the sulfur in particular, um, which is actually really, really high in Broccoli sprouts. Have you ever had Broccoli sprouts? Broccoli sprouts actually contained like a hundred times more of it than mature Broccoli.

Speaker 3:          00:33:45       So it's like probably the best source of sulfur, dietary source of sulfur fain out there on your instagram that you, you make shakes with that, right? I do, yeah. I've become sort of convinced that it's a very powerful anti aging and also powerful nootropic in a way. I guess I could say. Um, and I can elaborate, but you know, so I've been doing these shakes where you can, you can sprout, you can sprout your own sprouts at home for a relatively cheap. You just buy some organic weed dealer. That's what about three point five pounds of Broccoli spouts, wink, wink. That's what they call it. These kids, believe it or not though, if you freeze them. So I was actually, I'm freezing. So those bags are going in the freezer when you freeze them because when you freeze the plant, the tissue also gets like broken.

Speaker 3:          00:34:42       It actually doubles. In some cases you can up to double the amount of sulfur Fein because it like has a longer time to form this so you can have more concentrated. I learned that the hard way, but um, what hardware, let me just, because it's so pungent and powerful that if you make a shake with it and you're doing, like at first I was doing fresh shakes and then we start freezing them and I was making shakes that were from previously frozen sprouts and it's like I needed like half the dose, um, you know, to feel, to feel the same thing or if I feel I'm okay. So I guess I should probably, you know, it's kind of just like, like when you drink coffee, you know, how you kind of just, you feel a little happy and good and you feel a little more alert.

Speaker 3:          00:35:32       Um, sort of like that. And it was. The thing is, is that it's been shown. So there have been clinical studies in humans and this is very interesting because it's been shown like if you give it, you give, you know, even just a small amount. I think it was like between seven to 30 milligrams of sulfur free in a day to two young adults with autism that it improved their autistic scores by like 34 percent. And artistic scores, they liked the, there's a range of different tests that are done to like measure different various brain functions, but improve this and this. He autistic autistic individuals by like 34 percent. The same was done. Um, in a pilot study for people with schizophrenia were like improve their symptoms so they're just, their brain functions better. Wow. Yeah. So, and this is like pretty, um, the, the results were so powerful that, you know, this was done at Johns Hopkins.

Speaker 3:          00:36:30       The study is now being repeated, um, you know, because it's like this is what is going on here. Like how is this affecting the brain? And I think, you know, if you look at a lot of the animal studies, there's lots and lots of animal studies that have been done, which are, you know, people aren't quite as convinced because it's like, well, how much of this relates to humans, but it's been shown to be as effective as um, the, the antidepressant Prozac in alleviating depression and mice. And they do all these battery of tests were they stress the mice out and make them depressed and social defeat in like the hanging by their tail. It's actually just kind of gnarly. But, and then there's like, you know, a bunch of tests they do to see if they're depressed and you give them, you know, your, your placebo, you give them Prozac or you give them the, the Broccoli sprout extract and it performed just as well.

Speaker 3:          00:37:16       Um, so it helps depression, it's been shown to help with neurodegenerative diseases, all sorts of things. But the point is, I think that the reason it's actually affecting all these brain functions and why even you know, someone like me may notice a small effect from, from eating them is because it has very profound effect on inflammation. And that is because, as I mentioned, it's, it switches on one of those switches that was meant to be switched on a pathway called NRF two and our body that controls over 200 genes. And so for Fein is the most potent naturally occurring compound that we've discovered yet that activates this pathway. So it's no other plant compound or they're naturally occurring plant compound can activate this pathway is potent as sulforaphane and nrf two is, I mean, it's been shown in multiple studies to be involved in delaying aging and a lot of that happens through lowering tons of different inflammatory genes, activating anti-inflammatory genes, lowering oxidative stress, glutathione related enzymes.

Speaker 3:          00:38:21       It helps with detoxifying compounds that we're exposed to on a daily basis like percentages and things. So I think that we're having a low level of this like inflammation stuff that we're constantly being exposed to and it affects the brain, you know, so if you're, if you get a dose of this, you, you may notice a small effect now with someone that has autism or schizophrenia, inflammation and oxidative stress had been shown in previous studies on multiple previous studies to, to play a role in the etiology of those diseases. So I think that's how it may be effecting the brain, but it's not just affecting the brain. And probably one of the most well known, um, functions of sulfur Fein is that it's like a very powerful, a cancer preventative, um, compound. So it's, you know, it's been shown to prevent cancer. Uh, for example, if you have men that had prostate cancer when they were given 60 milligrams of sulfur, feign a day for, I think it was like a month, I don't remember exactly how long, but it lowered its slowed the doubling rate of a tumor biomarker called prostate specific Antigen Psa, which is what is usually measured when men have prostate cancer.

Speaker 3:          00:39:30       You mentioned the progression of it because it has a doubling rate. It doubles every so often, but it slowed that doubling rate by 86 percent, which is pretty, pretty profound. Of course, there's lots and lots of associative studies that have shown cruciferous vegetables, you know, if you eat more of them, you have lower risk of bladder, ovarian, prostate, kidney, just all sorts of cancers. Um, but there's the clinical trials I think are what's really telling because they're, you know, you're giving someone this compound and it's slowing a tumor. Progressive Progression Marker by 86 percent. Um, there's another study which is really interesting also, and this is kind of like what really got me interested. I'm not sure if other people are interested in it, but um, you know, we're exposed to two compounds from like air pollution. So like living in Los Angeles for example, is probably definitely one of the places that you're going to be more exposed to the.

Speaker 3:          00:40:24       So some of these airborne carcinogens, so benzenes one of them Aqualina. These things are in the air. We're breathing them in. We're, we're getting to some degree, we have it. We have benzene in our system and it is a carcinogen. It's been shown to cause cancer specifically linked to leukemia, has a smokers get a ton of it because it's in, it's in cigarettes. So cigarettes smokers are like really loaded up with benzene. But there was a study where people were given like 40 milligrams of sulforaphane in the form of a Broccoli sprout drink a day for like a week and starting on day one of tea drinking this drink, they excrete id 61 percent of the benzene, like on day one, 61 percent of benzene which is coming out of their urine, like as you measure metabolites. And I was like, wow, that is amazing. Like getting rid of some of that stuff, you know, I, you know, because I'm definitely want to get rid of the benzene and all that stuff that I'm being exposed to.

Speaker 3:          00:41:22       So that really got my attention too because it was just so significant and a profound effect just after one day. Um, so that, that was another sort of thing that got me really it. And then the aging stuff where it's been shown some inflammation has been identified as a key age or of aging. Taking sulforaphane has been shown to lower inflammatory markers in people, um, by like 20 percent c reactive protein, other inflammatory markers. Of course there's like dozens of studies in animals that have been done, but I'm sort of, I think the human studies are more interesting to talk about. So definitely more relevant. Um, and then also it's been shown to effect a cardiovascular health because of the inflammation. I think so type two diabetics that were given, uh, some, some dose, I think it was something around 40 milligrams as well as of sulforaphane.

Speaker 3:          00:42:12       They were given this daily and for a month, for four weeks and it lowered their triglycerides by 20 percent. It lowered their atherogenic index, which is measuring, you know, the dangerous type of Ldl, small dense ldl triglycerides, looking at all these things, lower that by 50 percent, improve their blood sugar by almost 20 percent. So that's like I'm getting my mouth, I'm trying to get my mom on this. I'm, you know, my mom, she, she definitely has got like high triglycerides, you know, thing. So I'm really convinced. And then there's been studies in animals that's just shown that it like delays aging. So I'm convinced that I think it's one of those things like you get it in Kale and I think that I've been getting a good dose of it. I've been drinking Kale smoothies. I'm pretty regularly since I'm probably like 2010. Yeah, probably about six or seven years.

Speaker 3:          00:43:03       And I do feel like it's like help age, like help me age like a little better. I mean, it could be completely in my mind, but just because I know it killed has held, killed with healthy, but I think that I've found something to take it to another level where I think that I'm pretty convinced that if I continued taking the Sulforaphane, um, I think it will absolutely affect the way I age and I think it will affect my brain aging as well. I mean, it's been shown to at least an animal studies to affect brain aging, traumatic brain injury. I mean if you administered after traumatic brain injury, it improves. Outcome, improves your brain swelling and all that by like 50 percent, you know, just all sorts of nones. It's just like I could go on and I have a video. I did like a 45 minute video where I'm literally just talking about this for 45 minutes and then I went on Youtube.

Speaker 3:          00:43:49       It's on youtube. Yeah. And I, um, I did this, this research took month, many months and it's like a 16 page article I wrote. Um, and I hope to get published. I think I'm going to submit it for publication because it's just, it was a lot of work and I haven't seen anything in the literature as comprehensive covering every base. Like I just, I tried to cover everything that was like a good study, you know, that was important. And I'm so, so um, and then I flew out to Johns Hopkins, uh, recently I was invited to give a talk there and I met it just so happens the guy who discovered that, first of all, the guy who discovered Sofer Fein is there, but he's much older. I didn't meet with. I met with someone who trained with him, um, who discovered that Broccoli sprouts are the best source of sulfur.

Speaker 3:          00:44:33       And so he made that discovery back in the nineties. Um, and I interviewed him and he just went on and on and on and talked about so far are like, in addition to like what I had already talked about on one of the videos I did. And he actually had some really interesting stuff to talk about in terms of like, um, you know, you. So in order to get the sulfur thing, you have to, the plant has to be crushed or chopped and that's because it has an enzyme in it called my Ra cynase. And my Ross cynase is I'm heat sensitive. So when you, when you, when you steam your Broccoli, when you boil your Kale, when you saw your kill, any of that stuff, unfortunately your inactivating my Roston a's. And so you're not getting as much sulfur fain, you're getting dramatically less dramatic, almost not almost nonexistent.

Speaker 3:          00:45:22       The precursor Glucoraphanin is still in that plant. So, so you're getting the precursor and we do have some bacteria, some types of bifido bacteria in our gut that contain the, my ra, Annie's enzyme, highly variable from individual to individual, but so you can convert some of that to sulforaphane. But what was interesting that he mentioned is you can actually sprinkle mustard powder, like mustard powder that you buy, um, after you saw your Kale or after you steam your vegetables or what if you cook, if you apply heat to any of your cruciferous vegetables afterwards, you put the muscle paddle on mustard powder. It has active my Ross and he's in it and it's pretty. The myrosinase in the mustard seed is more heat stable so you can actually convert your precursor into the soul for fame by adding the mustard powder. And I was like, that is a really great wow.

Speaker 3:          00:46:16       Like thing to know because now I'm like, because I do cook a lot of. I saw take all the time. Um, I, you know, I steam my Broccoli, put some butter and salt, pepper. That's how I eat my broccoli. So it wasn't very useful. Are there any compounds in Kale or broccoli or anything else that makes them more bioavailable when you do cook them? Um, yeah. I mean a lot of the minerals and stuff in it, like magnesium, the calcium, those things are, those things become more bioavailable when you cook them. And so you would get that benefit. Plus if you just cooked it, the mustard. So when the master seed powder, you have to make sure it's. What I like to do is sprinkle a little bit on my hand and lick, lick it, like it's got to give. It has to have that bite.

Speaker 3:          00:46:59       If it doesn't have the bite, it's like, it's been degraded. It's been on the shelf for too long. It's been an Amazon shelves for too long. Whatever, you know. So, um, yeah, it has to have that light mustard bite to it. Could you regular mustard? I don't think so. Now. Mustard seed. The mustard seed. Yeah. Uh, so that. So that was a very useful like, you know, because the Sulforaphane, it's really good joe. I really am. I'm trying to get people to. I think the more people that get the sulforaphane in life, I think they're gonna be healthier. I think it can help prevent cancer, lower inflammation. I'm just so many different good things. So smokers, for God's sake, if you're a smoker, they should be taking sulfur free. They should be drinking those shakes. I'm drinking, drinking like every day, you know, because they are getting so much benzene.

Speaker 3:          00:47:46       So two questions about this one. Where does someone get Broccoli sprouts? Where, where would you get that? Well, also the thing is, is that you can borrow, you can buy Broccoli sprouts already, sprouted at like whole foods or sprouts or whatever your local grocery store is. Most, most grocery stores contain a have Broccoli, sprouts, sprouts. It's very rarely that you find Broccoli sprouts, isn't it? At whole foods? They're at sprouts. But the problem, here's the problem with buying sprouts, um, they're very prone to, to bacterial contamination. The cookie Kolai that the longer they sit on the shelf and a lot of times when you go into these grocery stores, they're sitting on the shelf and so they're probably likely a little more contaminated with Nikolai then if you were to sprout them yourself and get them fresh so you can buy them. Um, but I think, and they also charge like it's like five bucks for like a little package of it, you know, it's like one shake, right?

Speaker 3:          00:48:54       Yeah, I'd say one shake, whereas you can spend 20 bucks and get like a pound of seeds. And so how do you grow it? Um, well there's lots of different methods you can, you can use hemp. Like, so previously we used to do these hemp, um, hemp bags where we just put, you put the seeds in the bag and you add some water. Uh, you basically just keep adding water to them and let it drip and they sprout within like four days. Then we started doing this jar method where now we have mason jars with a lid on top that has like little holes that are big enough for water to come out obviously, but not for the seeds to come out. And so, you know, you get these jars and you add water, let it sit for like six hours and then dump it out.

Speaker 3:          00:49:32       And then you just, after that you continually just add the water and dump it out and add the water interpreter and kind of leave it tilted so that the water isn't just like, you don't want the water just sitting in there so that it's like growing bacteria and stuff. So like let you know, tilt the water and just wet. Yeah. And it really just takes like four days. And then you have sprouts. The only thing is you have, you do have to be, you know, clean like your counters all dirty and your hands are dirty and all the dish where you're using this dirty, then you're probably going to contaminate them. So you have to like, be a little fastidious about the way you spread out these things. Um, you know, but I think once you're aware of that, then it's okay. The other thing is, um, and this is something that I'm going to talk to to the expert.

Speaker 3:          00:50:17       His name is Dr Jed Fahy. I recently interviewed him on my podcast. He mentioned something to me that like caught my interest. He said the seed itself, the Broccoli seed itself has the enzyme, it has the precursor to sulforaphane. And if you break or crush the seed or chew the seed, then you're actually getting. So for refrain. So you can actually crush up the seed and like a coffee grinder or something and like take a shot of it. But the thing is, is there's been no research doing this method. So all these studies that I just talked about in humans, those were all done from like Broccoli sprout powder extract from the sprouts. Powder extracts is something they goodbyes a supplement. Great question. Um, so. Well the powder extracts were mostly made by researchers. In fact Jed, jed is supplied a lot of, um, a lot of different universities with the, with the extract himself.

Speaker 3:          00:51:09       Um, but there are so supplement wise, that's the other thing that he really sort of illuminated for me because, because he's actually been measuring this certain supplements that are on the market and like if they actually have what they say they have. Um, and so because myrosinase is so unstable, it is hard to make a supplement with sulfur roofing. There is one supplement only one that I know of that actually has sulforaphane, the actual active compound and that's called prostitution. And that's only available in France by the way. I have no affiliation with any of these supplement companies at all. I'm just telling information. It's only available in France. It's only available in France and so and that. So he actually tested that one and people that were given Prostif I'm the bioavailability of the soul for roofing with 70 percent, so 70 percent of it ended up like in their bloodstream.

Speaker 3:          00:52:02       Um, there's another supplement called Avma [inaudible]. Avma McCall has Glucoraphanin plus myrosinase in it, so it doesn't have the Sulforaphane, has the two compounds that can form, so for a friend, but it hasn't been together, um, that has been tested and that was a bout 40 percent by bioavailability. So about 40 percent of it was you were actually getting sulforaphane 40 percent of the time and that was also tested. There's another supplement and that is available in the US. There's another supplement by thorne called Coursera I think. And Chris Sarah only has the precursor no enzyme, so you're totally relying on your gut bacteria. And some people it's very variable, so that only had a 10 percent bioavailability. Um, other than that, those are the three supplements that he really could. And this isn't a study who just published recently that he got behind. I asked him about a few others because I had actually been taking, uh, there's another one called Brocka Max by jarrow and he kind of was like asked him about it and he was kind of like [inaudible] has some of what it says in there but not all, you know. And, and the problem is, is that these supplements, I mean there's a lot of, a lot of the times like he was telling me like, Jeez, like seven out of 10 times these supplements had like cloverleaf in them when they're supposed to have like

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       the cruciferous precursor Glucoraphanin. So it's just like, it's kind of disgusting how supplement company, how somebody a supplement companies are totally just putting all this cloverleaf and whatever. And there was a study that came out like a couple of years ago on this, like, like 75 percent of all these, like herbal Achalasia, like all these, you know, compounds that are, you know, you know, marketed for whatever, don't actually even contain economically or whatever they say they contain. It's really, it's really kind of bad. So it's a giant issue and if you're a company that sells that stuff, a lot of times you're not even, you're not even getting it directly from the source, you know, they're buying it from companies that supply it to them. And a lot of times these companies are in China and places where there were regulations are not that strict.

Speaker 2:          00:54:13       You can, you can get just with. I mean, we had an issue with that when we first started making Alpha brain where we would get stuff tested, we get batches tested in the batches of different individual ingredients would have stuff in it that they weren't supposed to have in it just because they're mixing it all up in the same bins. Oh yeah, that's true. There's also that. Yeah, I mean there's just, you got to find a reliable brand, you know, and I think, you know, Thorn Thorn seems to be a pretty reliable one that, um, I've seen multiple, multiple different, you know, times where scientists were like, yeah, we've tested that. It, it's more expensive, but they seem to be pretty reliable. So it seems like the best method is a sprout your own Broccoli sprouts. So I think that's the best method and it seems like very cost effective to.

Speaker 2:          00:55:01       Exactly. It's cost effective. You don't, you don't have to have extra cash to buy all these expensive supplements because the all the ones I just mentioned that actually are effective and have what they say they're not cheap. So that those bags that you had, that instagram photo, is that all sprouts that you'd made yourself a mason jars at two, six, six, six. Oh Wow. That's not that bad. Yeah. I mean they get really dense to. They fill up inside the jar. Yeah. Yeah. I have like other pictures somewhere on there. They were there with the jars, but I'm thinking I might just do a quick spreading video like a fiber six minute, like I'm already going in my head about how I'm going to start sprouting. Awesome. And they're good. Like, you know, you don't have to do. I always sort of take it to the next level.

Speaker 2:          00:55:44       Like I make my shake and it's like, um, but they're good on salads. I mean, you know, you can sprinkle them on anything, you know, it's, I really, I really liked them on salads quite a bit. So that's amazing. Now, uh, there you go. Oh, there we go. Does the. Yeah. So those. So those are the mason jars that have holes already in them. Yes. You can actually buy this sprouting kit. So these actually we found these are the old lids we were using. We actually found better lids that have even smaller holes because some of the seeds were getting out of this, but this came as a kit, a sprouting kit you can buy on Amazon. It has like a little wooden going to set the mason jars in so they're like tilted and you can like, you know, drip the water out. They came with those lids.

Speaker 2:          00:56:29       But then we did some experimentation and found other leds that are superior to those. But those, how much maintenance is involved in making these. Like how often do you have to attend to these things? Oh, it's just like after the first initial, like six our water. You know what? You let them sit. It's like twice a day in the morning and evening dump water on them, but you have to rip them out. And how long does it take to grow that? That was about five days, I think. Four or five days. So for a guy like me who goes away on weekends a lot, I'd have to make sure that I am home for a stretch where you can. So, so you could have Harvard is actually. So here's the thing, the longer you're letting them sprout. So I was just trying to maximize and went more dense, you know, because I wanted to get my bang for my buck.

Speaker 2:          00:57:13       But you can actually, you could have Harvard is harvested though, is probably like early, like three days, three and a half days. Um, and actually the longer you wait, the more you have to be careful with contamination too. So it's like, it's better probably even to harvest them sooner. Freeze them. So they're like, you know, no bacteria that way you're just, you're safe. And you're just putting them in a ziploc storage bags. Yeah. Do you ever vacuum seal things and freeze them? And now I should do that with me. Yeah, it's a good idea. I mean, that, that would, that would be a good idea to do. Wow, that's a, that's really intense stuff. The other question that I wanted to have a talk to you about was when you were saying schizophrenia and how so fewer feign can prevent or somehow mitigate the effects of schizophrenia.

Speaker 2:          00:58:01       Do you think that there is a possible correlation between a lot of these mental health diseases and a lack of proper nutrition? Oh, absolutely. I think that a lack of proper nutrition is a huge component of a lot of mental diseases and psychological diseases in general. Um, in fact, inflammation is now it's really been identified as I caused playing a causal role in depression. Um, and that's something that, you know, so with the depression thing, uh, it's, here's, here's kind of a funny story and it's not that funny. It's actually kind of eye opening, but back in the, so the CDC has estimated that about 11 percent of, of um, Americans are on some sort of antidepressant. Eleven percent. That's a lot. So here's the story behind that. So crazy it is, and I know several people that are on them or have taken them or you know, you know, whatever. But the story behind that is kind of interesting because back in like the early seventies, um, a lot of these clinical trials were being done on antidepressants with people that had depression and at that time people that had depression, um, that were involved in these trials

Speaker 3:          00:59:23       were people that were severely depressed and hospitalized, so they were so depressed that they had been hospitalized for depression. I don't know many people that had been hospitalized for depression nowadays, but so they were hospitalized for depression and then they were given either placebo or an depressant and a multiple trials. You know, FDA had reviewed these trials 70 percent of the time, the antidepressant. So the antidepressant worked in 70 percent of the patients compared to 30 percent of the patients were placebo worked, right? Seventy percent is pretty good if you're comparing that to 30 percent in placebo, it's like, well that's efficacious. That seems to work. Right. What then happened after those trials were done starting in the seventies and eighties, is that the clinical diagnostic manual, it's called the dsm. At that time it was the DSM two, they changed all their, um, their diagnosis, um, you know, markers and, and uh, symptoms for depression and they expanded it a great, great deal.

Speaker 3:          01:00:23       And they then called depression major depressive disorder. So it became this sort of like broader, you know, a disease, quote unquote, where it was like, it's not just these people that are severely hospitalized, it's people that are feeling depressed and anxious and sad or what, you know, it's just basically you're, you're getting a bigger group of people, which is probably a great opportunity for, for a pharmaceutical company. But then when clinical trials were repeated on this new population of people, so these, these are clinical trials that were done from like the eighties all the way up until like the 2000 year, 2000 when those were reviewed, reviewed by the FDA. What was found was quite shocking and that was that only 40 percent of people were now responding to like antidepressants. SSRI is other norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, lots of whatever the standard of care is compared to 30 percent placebo.

Speaker 3:          01:01:20       So now you're talking about only 10. They're performing only this antidepressants performing only 10 percent better than placebo. It's like, okay, something so clearly. It's not that the antidepressants don't ever work, it's just that we are now over prescribing them to people that you know or have this major depressive disorder and they're not working on people that weren't, you know, the, the initial group of people that were like severely depressed and hospitalized, you know. So it's like, okay, that's, that's a big problem because they're, I mean they're prescribed like, I mean I just like, I can't even believe it, you know, I just have so many personal stories. People I know, you know, that have gone, you know, going through some crisis and personal, a divorce, whatever, and also in their given you some crazy center giving some crazy drug and they changed the personality of the person.

Speaker 3:          01:02:15       And I'm just like, please get off of this. Like, you know, it's not like. And like I said, it's not like they don't ever work, it's just that, you know, I think once the clinical diagnostic book changed the whole procedure for diagnosing depression and became major depressive order disorder, all of a sudden you're getting people that are now like having just, you know, whatever stressful event in their life that's making them a little depressed the time which everyone's probably experienced are now being given this antidepressant when they don't really need it. And there are effects that are not good with taking some of these, you know, and a depressant. So it was a big effect on Libido. Yeah. Onto the lobby.

Speaker 4:          01:02:54       Yeah. I know a lot of people that have taken it where their sex drive just goes away.

Speaker 3:          01:02:58       Yeah. There's actually a gene that's a gene polymorphism, a variation in a gene that, that is linked to that. So people that have it have even more severe effect where they really don't. They really have like sexual dysfunction and response to a. It just shuts down. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't happen to everyone quite as much, but there, there's a percentage of people that it really, really affects. And there's lots of other things. I mean it's just, it's changing your brain chemistry, right?

Speaker 4:          01:03:25       It's not exact. It's an inexact science. No, there's a lot of experimentation going on with it. I had a friend of mine who had gone to several doctors and they had prescribed a bunch of different things to him and he was severely depressed and eventually they gave up and he had to find a much better doctor that his care, his whatever his insurance package would not pay for. And once you found that doctor, then the doctor was just more knowledgeable about what potential different ones. I mean, I don't know how many different ones there are, but they got them on something that actually worked. He's off it now. It took them awhile and then eventually got happy. And then oddly enough, which is an interesting thing because people always want to connect depression. They want to say depression is a disease and they want to say it almost like, oh, you got herpes.

Speaker 4:          01:04:17       Like, you know what I mean? It's like, well, you've got depression. Oh, well you need medicine. And for him, the. One of the big factors in fixing everything was his own success, his own personal success, and then he became more happy and then his, the medication helped. He became more successful and then as he became eventually really successful, he started to experience like a better quality of life. He was happier, he was more confident and then he slowly weaned himself off and now he has no need for them to mean. That is so fascinating because so we're not talking about necessarily a disease, like he does not have cancer. It's not like that they cured him of a disease. It's, it was a blanket that was keeping him warm, you know, it was something that was, was allowing him to bridge the gap between an unhealthy mental state and healthy mental state.

Speaker 4:          01:05:08       But a lot of that health had to do with his own life. He still eats like shit. I mean, he's not like the healthiest guy. He eats a lot of fucking candy, but a really healthy now as far as like his mind, he's very happy. He's not lying, you know, he's not faking it. So to me it's always. I mean, when, when you know, I've talked to friends that have had really good results with antidepressants, so I think there are some dark moments in people's lives where that can kind of get them out of that, but then part of me doesn't buy that. That's the way to go because part of me is like, okay, well did you exercise? No. Did you take like really healthy foods? No. Did you clean your life up? No. Did you like how, what happened here? And one of the things that a lot of these antidepressants do is they make you not feel bad about stuff like about anything.

Speaker 4:          01:06:01       Like A. I had a friend who was on Zoloft and she said like, she took it for a year and she's like, I kind of lost a year of my life. Like I didn't give a fuck about anything during that year. Like anything can happen. It's scary. Yeah. But that not giving a fuck, not, not feeling bad. You also, you don't feel great either. You don't feel like you don't feel like God, it's a good time to be alive. Look at me, I'm healthy. I can move, you know, like all those thoughts don't sort of come into play. It's like it dulls everything. It dulls the highs and the dolls, the lows and it keeps the pain away.

Speaker 3:          01:06:34       That's kind of interesting because believe it or not, that's actually a symptom of depression. I think it's called Hedonia or something where someone's not really responsive to anything. It's like you can't, like, you just can't like, you know, you know, like excite them or, or like make them super anxious either. They're just kind of like, you know. So that's actually kind of interesting that she was experiencing that while on an antidepressant. Will the results vary pretty widely? Totally. Yeah. I mean with the same drugs, right? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:07:06       Now is that because of biodiversity, like what, what's causing that? That you could take something and you would have a totally different reaction? I can take something and it would just

Speaker 3:          01:07:16       perfect. Yeah. I, you know, I honestly, I don't think we actually know really why that is, but what we do know is that there are, I mean there are different, you know, we are different people and I've got different genes that are regulating how much serotonin I making, how much dope immune I'm making, how much I'm metabolizing it, how quickly I'm metabolizing it than you and other people. And so when you like MP and this is, this absolutely does affect how some of these drugs are, you know, when they're taken, how, how they are with their biological effect is now, you know, why, why, I don't know, you know, so it's, there's definitely like a, a genetic variation that, that affects the way our neurotransmitters are being fired away in the way are I'm being metabolized. And so if you're, if you're adding a drug that's changing the way something's being metabolized already, then it's gonna affect people differently I think.

Speaker 3:          01:08:08       I think that's one reason, but honestly, I don't know. Who knows? There's maybe like other, you know, life situations. Well, other dietary situations, all these things probably play a role, you know, with the inflammation I was talking about actually playing a causal role. I mean, there've actually been, studies were normal, healthy people are injected with either a placebo, which is saline water, saltwater, or they're injected with something that our gut produces called endotoxin. Our gut produces it when our immune cells in our gut attack the bacteria in our gut because endotoxin is actually a component of the bacterial cell membrane and that is released upon inflammation. So when you're eating a terrible diet, lots of refined sugar, um, and that's, that's actually been shown, um, you release endotoxin and it causes inflammatory response. So when people are injected with endotoxin or they're injected with proinflammatory cytokines, interferon gamma, which we also make in our body, when we're inflamed, people start to, at normal healthy people start to experience feelings of depression. They start to feel depressed, anxious, social withdraw.

Speaker 3:          01:09:19       People with the placebo did not experience that. Um, also they had elevated levels of other inflammatory biomarkers, biomarkers in their blood. So it really like, and this is just, this is causal. And when we're talking about injecting in relation to inflammation, all of a sudden they're experiencing these depressive symptoms. It was actually people that were then given. I'm one of the omega three fatty acids, EPA. They're given an actually a pretty high dose of it. I think it was close to like two grams or something, uh, completely, um, alleviated any of those symptoms so that. So those people that were getting the inflammatory cytokine or the endotoxin and the EPA did not experience those symptoms. So it was really like inflammation, you know, driven, uh, these symptoms that were not experienced in the placebo. Um, so that's kind of, and there's been multiple studies showing this not, you know, it's not just one studies, multiple studies, multiple studies.

Speaker 3:          01:10:07       Again, this is kind of like a new method people are using to explore how inflammation affects depression. It also has been shown the same sort of scenario where there's a placebo and they're injecting a inflammatory cytokine. Dopamine levels lower in the brains of people that were injected with the proinflammatory cytokines, but not the saline water. And also the reward pathway in the brain, um, is also decreased. So, you know, again, like I was mentioning, you're not that excitable, you don't, you know, it's just kinda like and that, and that was not, that did not happen in the placebo group. So this was not just an effect of being shot up with something, you know. So, um, when, when, uh, scientists have looked at some, some of the mechanisms and explored will, how is it that inflammation is affecting dopamine in the brain? How is it that it's effecting people's mood?

Speaker 3:          01:10:56       It's thought now there's a variety of mechanisms. One is that, you know, these inflammatory cytokines, they actually cross the blood brain barrier, the get into the brain and they disrupt dopamine release. They disrupt serotonin release that disrupt norepinephrine release, you know, they're disrupting these neurotransmitters being released. Um, the other thing is that there's been recently a discovered that the lymphatic system is actually directly connected to the brain through the meninges. And then it was previously thought that that was like cutoff. The brain was protected from the lymphatic system, but it turns out we were wrong in everything that we learned in text books for years and years and our science classes was not accurate. Actually, we are. Our lymphatic system is connected and what that means is that our immune system, the chemicals, the inflammatory cytokines were producing, you know, from our immune cells are getting into the brain and disrupting neurotransmitter release and other things.

Speaker 3:          01:11:50       So there's obviously a really strong connection to inflammation and depression that's shown to be causal. But when you think about it, it's like, well, what causes inflammation? Okay, well we can talk about the sugar stuff because that's been shown eating a terrible diet does. But the other thing that causes it, and it's what you, you mentioned that is a stressful event in someone's life, an emotional event, you know, a breakup, um, a tragedy, work related stress, social anxiety, whatever it is, anything that causes you to release cortisol, stress hormones, believe it or not, those things actually affect inflammation in your gut. So it's like a two way street here. I think that previously you and I have talked about in other podcasts, like how gut microbiome bacteria, you know, you can take microbiome bacteria from an anxious mouse and transplanted into a nonanxious mouse and make us anxious and vice versa, right?

Speaker 3:          01:12:45       So there's like some sort of gut brain access through with something called the vagal nerve. Well, it goes both ways. You can go from the brain down to the gut. So it's been shown that like, um, cortico releasing hormone, which is a stress hormone, you know, we get through the vagal nerve when you release it, goes into the gut. It activates immune cells which then activate other proteins in the gut that chew up there called proteases. They chew up the gut barrier and then you start to release more influent, inflammatory cells, which then like get in contact with bacteria, more inflammation, and then it goes back. It's like this feedback loop. So I think that's how stress also part of the mechanism, how a stressful event and any sort of breakup or tragedy, those sorts of things also cause inflammation. They cause inflammation. In fact, it's a totally off topic, but that's one reason why people should never go and like get like blood work done, like like a day or two after some kind of traumatic event because get fired. Don't get your blood work done. Yeah. Like do you not get your blood or break up or whatever? Yeah, because they will like, it will skew everything. Wow. Everything.

Speaker 4:          01:13:56       Well that's, that's so amazing. And when you discuss this and when you lay all these facts out, it makes it seem so irresponsible that 10 percent of the people are on this drug. Eleven percent, excuse me, are on this drug or whatever, a pet category of these drugs instead of dealing with it. I mean it seems like it's, it's, we're in a weird place when it comes to the holistic treatment of the human body. We're, we're in a very weird place where we have all this information now, but it doesn't seem like it's being applied when it comes to the average person who is suffering the average person who is dealing with the disease or depression, which I guess you could call a disease and it just seems so insane that with all we know that we're treating it only with this chemical pathway. We're only treating with a pill. This pharmacy, you know, this Pharma collage, local solution to this, which just seems so limited, upsetting.

Speaker 3:          01:14:57       It's so upsetting. It's very upsetting. I am like, it's like a mission of mine, you know, I think, you know, I think that the problem is multifold one is that you have, you know, psychiatrists and they're trained a certain way and people when their patients come in, they expect that they're going to come pay. They come in because they want a pill. Most of the time they do, they come in because they don't want to deal with it and they want a pill. And so, you know, that's kind of a problem because they need. People need to understand that these pills are not the magic bullet. I mean I just told you, only 40 percent people are responding to these antidepressants that are standard of care compared to 30 percent that respond to placebo. A sugar pill like that is ridiculous, you know? So I think I would love if there was some way to get a physician or I'm usually their psychiatrist that people go to for these sorts of problems to like push someone to say you have to go run, you know you're going to run six miles a week, you're going to run, you're going to do that.

Speaker 3:          01:15:57       That is going to help you. Like, you know, it's, in fact, it's been shown. It's been shown in multiple studies. That exercise helps improve depression. And one of the ways it does it very interestingly is that aerobic exercise specifically has been shown that whole serotonin pathway. We're talking about inflammation inhibiting release of Serotonin. Well guess what? Inflammation affects serotonin. And another way, Sarah, the precursor to Serotonin, Serotonin Tryptofan, when you have inflammation. So like I said, an emotional event causes inflammation, doesn't have to be your sugar diet. Okay. What are, you know, inflammation can be caused by your, your cortisol release. When you have that inflammation in your body thinks that it needs to fight off something, but that's what it thinks. It's like, okay, this, I'm sick, I've got foreign invader, I need to kill it. And so the trip to fan, which usually is being transported into the brain to make Serotonin, which plays a role in how you feel it plays a role in lots of brain functions, then gets diverted into another pathway because your body's like, wait a minute, I don't need to feel good.

Speaker 3:          01:16:59       I need to, I need to survive and need to live. So the trip to fan gets converted into this whole other pathway called learning, which helps with. It means basically immune cells need it to a different immune cells needed to make different types of immune cells. So your body is like, okay, the trip, your going to this other pathway, I need more immune cell, blah blah blah. But the problem is that the journey and then gets converted into. So now what you have is you're depleting your brain of Serotonin. Boom, right there, right? That's the first thing. So if you're not sick and if you have chronic inflammation, you're chronically stressed, chronically eating a terrible diet, then you are going to constantly be diverting the Serotonin. You know the trip to fan and his other pathway. You're going to be depleting your cranium Serotonin, right?

Speaker 3:          01:17:40       So that's one thing. This is a twofold problem. Then that whole kind of yearning thing gets converted into something called quinolinic acid, which actually crosses over the blood brain barrier, becomes a neurotoxin and also has been shown to cause depression. So not only you're not getting Serotonin, you're getting this gnarly shit and your brain that's not supposed to be there. I'm an exercise. It's been shown specifically aerobic exercise causes your muscle to soak up the Kenyan running. I'm actually another precursor to it so that it can't form quinolinic acid. So it doesn't form the, the neurotoxin park part, but you know, exercise also caused you to make to. It makes trip to fan. Go into your brain, you know, it alleviates some of the competition with branch chain amino acids like leucine and lysine, leucine, so that's another way it's doing a million things, brain derived neurotrophic factor.

Speaker 3:          01:18:27       We talked about at the beginning of the podcast that also plays a role in depression, helping prevent depression, you know, so neurogenesis, neurogenesis, all that stuff that helps growing new brain cells, making new connections helps. Helps you deal with stress. That's why you make it. When you stress your body, it seems like there could be some sort of a whole holistic approach like or clinic that looks at all of these factors. It looks at all these factors and prescribes instead of just prescribing a pill, prescribes a very specific diet and exercise routine and maybe even meditation, maybe even something that the practices or or or or enhances mindfulness or promotes mindfulness. Something that allows you to manage the way you're viewing and taking in scenarios and scenes and events in your life and then processing them in a more healthy manner. It seems like all of these things would be as effective or maybe more effective than just a pill.

Speaker 3:          01:19:22       I agree with you and I'm hopeful for the future. I think that the more. There's a lot of scientists that are studying this now. I mean it's becoming very common to look in the scientific literature and, and see, you know, scientists researching inflammation and the role of inflammation and depression and the role of exercise in helping treat it and the role of other, you know, dietary and lifestyle factors in causing and treating depression. So I think that, you know, I, I really am hopeful that in the near future that it, like you said, it's going to be a multipronged approach where it's not just a magic pill. And I'm not saying that's not also going to be included in some, you know, I'm just saying I think, I think the Diet lifestyle, meditation exercise, if we

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       could just get that into like, you know, the clinical world and if people were motivated enough to realize this will really help them. Like it really will. People will be so much happier. I really, I really think so. So um, people just don't want to fuck an exercise. It's weird. They would so much rather go to a doctor and get a pill. It's, it's so strange. It's a lot of people. Well, it's this fear of discomfort. People have this extreme feeling in their mind, uh, when it comes to their associations with exercise, they want to avoid discomfort. They feel like any type of exercise is just like something to be avoided. That's not for me. Fuck that. I don't want to sweat. I don't want to strain. And a lot of times this association that they have is about the beginnings of getting in shape.

Speaker 2:          01:20:58       It's not about once you're actually fit because once you're actually fit, exercise is something you look forward to. It's an alleviation of stress. It's, it feels great. Like if I can't get a workout in, I look at my schedule, I go, ah, shit, I don't have any time for a workout, which means I'm not going to get that good feeling. And so instead of looking at it like, oh, I've got to go grunt and sweat, I'm thinking I'm not going to feel good, I'm not going to feel relaxed, I'm not going to feel carefree and I'm not going to feel even appreciative, like my appreciation of things. And it gets enhanced greatly after exercise. I just feel better. I feel like I can take things in for what they are rather than, you know, whatever the sensory data that I'm getting from any event is just one more distraction that gets in my way.

Speaker 2:          01:21:42       And, and you know, that that's a lot of times how I look at things if I'm overstressed or if I'm working too much. Totally beautifully put. Um, because that, that that's exactly like, at least what's been shown from like neuro imaging studies is that exercise does what you're talking about is that executive function. You're talking about feeling good without that sensory stuff, which is the Amygdala, the emotional center that's been shown to be decreased in activity after exercise where the executive function is increased. So it's, it's just, it's done exactly in the right direction. Right. So you're, you're able to logically think about this more and you feel good and it's like you're not that, that sensory response that like gut, you don't feel it as much that that part of your brain is actually quieter after exercise. Meditation does a similar thing, but if there was just a way to get this knowledge to, to pay for people to understand people that are adverse to exercising, you know, if there was just some way, and I'm really trying to find a way because there are many people that I care about in my life that are that way and that feel depressed and are on some sort of know antidepressant, which doesn't really work for them still.

Speaker 2:          01:22:53       And so I'm trying to find a way. I like how like I can tell them I'm having this conversation with you and you get it because you experience it, you exercise, you, you know, you, you eat healthy, you experienced these things. But for someone that's

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       never experienced it, how do you communicate it to the. It's so hard for people to start anything new. It's, it's hard for people to start a pottery class that's not gonna, you know, it's not going to be involved with any physical pain or any stress or any exhaustion. There's no, there's not that feeling that you get when you're really tired, you know, the feeling that you get for me is particularly difficult. Doing boring stuff like on an elliptical machine, like elliptical machine to me. Uh, it's a great workout. It's awesome if I'm at a gym because if I go to a gym like at a hotel and you know, they have some bullshit weights and, but they have an elliptical machine. I go, okay, if this thing has a high setting, I could get a real workout on this. But those times when you're tired and you don't want to do it, they're so fucking boring.

Speaker 4:          01:23:54       It just, you'd have to listen to something. You have to watch something like others stimuli has to come in, in order to get you pumped up. But I know this because I've done it a thousand times, for someone who hasn't done it a thousand times, you, they get to that point like, fuck this, I'm out of here. Oh my God, let me get a donut. You know, give me a coffee. I'm gonna. Go outside and smoke a cigarette. Woo. I feel better, you know, and it's so hard to get past that because we have all these connections in our mind when it comes to comfort, comfort and stress, comfort and like our bodies for whatever reason, uh, most people, their associations are to avoid anything that's uncomfortable. But it's so illogical because when you look at comfort and you look at success and progress and the eventual, the feelings of accomplishment and of getting past certain hurdles and in terms of like how you feel about life, a lot of those are connected to discomfort.

Speaker 4:          01:24:54       Discomfort is your friend. It really is like discomfort and, and not being happy and content with certain situations in life or certain feelings in life. There are massive, massive motivators and they're, they're amazing at, at facilitating change. And yet our instinct is to avoid those and just sit on the couch and watch some fucking reality show about dudes and make moonshine with our jaw open. Like it's bizarre. It is. It's too much, too much of that. Like stimuli or where you don't have to do anything and you can still like get, get that sensory information. The need to act like to need to actually go out there and act is so strong. It's such an important thing. But yet we resisted many people. I know you don't. I don't, but so many people do. But I feel the thing, you know, I don't, I don't allow it to work, but I feel that fuck this, I don't want to work out. I feel it all the time. Almost every time before I work out I have at least an inclination of blow it off. I don't ever embrace it, but it's there. It's there with everybody. Like no one is like completely 100 percent healthy and without any resistance.

Speaker 3:          01:26:09       Yeah. I wonder if also that has. We're talking about this being a super ager. I wonder if there is some association. There were, you know, where we're looking at, we're looking at how it's important to push past that uncomfortableness, whether it's physical or mental and that's linked to being a super ager, but what if it's just like the ability to make yourself do that is important too, right? It's not just the act that you're doing, it's not just the strenuous exercise, which is obviously good and we know that it's good from science, but what if it's just being able to like push yourself. Like maybe some people don't have that ability for whatever reason or they just haven't tapped into it enough because I haven't really experienced it. I think that's it. I think it's a learned thing,

Speaker 4:          01:26:51       you know, because if I take time off, like um, I got sick recently and I couldn't work out for like a week or six days or so, and the, the act of getting back into the gym, I think a lot of ways we rely on momentum. We rely on the momentum of past experiences where you're just conditioned to do that. It's one of the things that you do and for me at least when I get, when I would get like really disciplined and really I get really consistent with my workouts. One of the things that I feel, I almost feel momentum. I feel like there's like a push behind me. Like, all right, we're, you know, like after I get out of the gym, I have a really good workout. I'm like, yeah, now I'm doing it. I'm doing it all the time now and I'm looking forward to the next time and it makes that resistance much weaker and it makes my motivation and my discipline much stronger.

Speaker 4:          01:27:44       I think a lot of it is based on just the consistency, you know, it's one of the things that I talked about recently on the podcast. I said, you know, blowing something off. It's not just not good, like blowing off of an exercise that you planned is not just bad for you physically. It's also bad mentally because then that option is now available. The option to fuck off is available and you did it before and you're probably going to do it again and you'll get mediocre results, not just in that aspect of your life, but maybe in all aspects of your life because I think that option to fuck off when you embrace it, that is a pathway that you might choose when it comes to dealing with conflict and your personal life, dealing with business decisions, dealing with career decisions like an uncomfortable decision that you might be faced with where you, maybe you need to make a change as far as like what your pathway is in life, but you don't do it instead you fuck off. And that the inclination to fuck off. I think that gathers momentum as well. The inclination to be disciplined. That comes with momentum too. And I think both things like you, did you take a path, the path of the healthy person or the path of the fuck off, like both of them are available and whichever path you embrace.

Speaker 3:          01:28:59       Totally. Totally. I, I think that um, the same thing goes for like lying to. I mean when you, I think it's very bad to lie, like even if it's something that is really benign, like what they call it, a little tiny white light. Great. Yeah. That, you know, because then you start making these neural connections in your brain and you start to like get used to doing it. Like you were saying and I think that it just kind of dawned on me as you were saying this, that with the motivation and the momentum you were talking about, I think that's the same way. I think you're like building these neural pathways, these motivation pathways and, and that's really important for that momentum to do it again and again, you know, there's been some studies, a few of them that have been done where you can take a person and do that direct transcranial stimulation, which I don't know much about, but I remember these studies and stimulate a certain part of the brain that's involved in motivation and you can motivate them to go to the gym. So you motivate them to actually go work out. So that's good.

Speaker 4:          01:29:59       More of those electrodes and they put on a specific area of the outside of your head and then it's like a little nine volt batteries attached to it and it just zaps you a little bit,

Speaker 3:          01:30:09       saps you a little bit and like activates a certain brain region and that brain region. It's activating specifically with this study I was talking about actually there's a couple of them were involved in motivation and that's probably with you and I. We already have those pathways activated because we are constantly forcing ourselves to go. I mean I feel the same way. There are times I'm like, God, I don't want to go for a run. Like once you do it, God damn me feel great. You feel great and you know what? You accomplished something so it's not only like you're feeling great from all the neural mechanisms that are being activated and all the biochemistry that's going on, but you've accomplished something. You did. You push past them and you didn't want to do. When you feel good about doing that after magnetic

Speaker 4:          01:30:48       stimulation therapy, Wilmington woman finds motivation. Energy. Yeah. There's a a radio lab about this, a radiolab podcast. It's called nine volt nirvana and it pretty good. I liked it. I love it. I love radio lab and it actually deals with the first story. The opening story is amazing because it deals with this woman who went to this like sniper training, simulation video, video thing that they do where they. They put you in front, they give you like a fake gun and they put you in front of a video screen and a scenario plays out and then the scenario there's like a terrorist attack and you have to take out the bad guys and they did it with her and she was. It's 20 minutes long and she was terrible. She fucked it all up. It was just like a disaster, like she didn't respond correctly.

Speaker 4:          01:31:36       Then they put these electrodes, what would you exactly call them? One of those things. It's electrodes, so they put these on her brain in the or on the outside of her head in very specific areas and stimulated it and then recreated it and in the recreation she was 100 percent effective. She killed all the bad guys and she went through this 20 thing and when it was over, when they told her that it was over, she thought they were fucking with her because she thought it was only two minutes. Like, yeah, like every is incredible. It's amazing the way she describes it as amazing. It's amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:32:13       It's a little scary too. Um, just because, I mean it's like, can you like program someone to do something? There's another study that was published like two years ago, same thing, trans cranial direct stimulation and um, I, I liked him, so not an expert on any of this, but I just remember this study because it was trying to investigate what part of the brain's fault in consciousness. Right. And so she said that the study was designed in such a way where she was reading a book and then they zapped or in a certain part of the brain and she stopped reading the book, this woman and just looked at them like a Zombie, like no, nothing, no talk, no. And then they zapped your again and she started right. She picked up right where she left off. I have no recollection at all of doing. So this was like, you know, trying to figure out if this part of the brain is involved in consciousness. Anyways, that was a little scary. Well that's. Yeah, that is

Speaker 4:          01:33:08       real concern, right? Because one of the things about this transcranial direct stimulation of Radiolab podcast was that they talked about how many people are out there just fucking experimenting where there's a whole community online where people are talking about like experimenting with the voltages and experimenting with the placement and one guy did something is lost his sense of taste like, but people are buying these and like doing it like you can go. It's like you'd go to fucking radio lab. The consequences of a world where anyone with $20 in access to radio shack and make their own brains Zapper. Yeah. That is, is that from radiolab? They're their podcast page. Wow. It's amazing because there's apparently this gigantic community of it like, hold on a second, go back up there and make that larger again. The last couple of years. Itd tdcs, trans direct cranial stimulation has been all over the news. Researchers claim that juicing the brain with just 2 million amps, nine volt, but think nine volt battery battery can help with everything from learning languages to quitting smoking, to overcoming depression. And so they brought it into a neuroscientist, Michael Weiss and at Wright State Research Institute into the studio to tell them how it works. Really interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:34:25       Very interesting. I, you know, I feel like in terms of like treating depression or helping people get motivated to go to the gym, it may really have relevance,

Speaker 4:          01:34:36       but it also might be like slapping a supercharger on an old chevy

Speaker 2:          01:34:40       below the fucking engine on the thing. You know, it's true. It's true. I mean, you don't really, you don't, we don't really know enough about what's going. I certainly wouldn't be experimenting with that. Amen. Now let's do it. Fuck it. I'm thinking about going to radio shack radio shack right after I get outta here. Not really, but sort of.

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       I mean, it's just interesting. It's, uh, it's, it's amazing that we are really some sort of a system and you can choose that system like electricity here, a little vitamin, they're, you know, a little, um, Broccoli sprouts here. It's like, that's the weirdest thing about people and one of the weirdest things about people is how variable we are depending upon what we put inside of us. And we don't think of it that way. Most of the time we think of ourselves as ourselves. You know, I'm sure you think of yourself as Rhonda Patrick, but Rhonda Patrick relies on a bunch of fucking chemicals to be Rhonda Patrick, right? I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on in there. It's not just, it's not this one like this is a laptop, you know, I'm not adding shit to this thing. Like I can put programs in it and stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:35:43       But I mean this is the, everything in there. It's kind of worked out. You know, there's a processor, there's a motherboard, it's all the, all this junk is in place and the electricity plugs into the back and it's not really variable. You know, the, the human body. So fucking variable and pliable and malleable. There's so many different things that you can do to make yourself better. Like I had this conversation with a friend of mine who's a not a physical fitness guy and he's kind of a realist and nihilist, I guess you would say. I never say that word. I just read it and he's, you know, he's a little bit of a curmudgeon and he's like, yeah, what's the point? You know, like really what is appointment? You're always doing all his martial arts and exercise. I go, okay, if I could give you a pill and that pill would turn you essentially into a super person, like you can do shit that you can't do now.

Speaker 4:          01:36:32       You could lift weights, you can't lift, you could beat people up, you could do physical fitness fits feats that, you know what you right now are totally insurmountable and outside the realm of possibility which take that pill. So, so, so simple. And he goes, no, I wouldn't go. You wouldn't? Okay. Um, if I could give you a pill that would prevent you from being a decaying old man and you could stay in the state you are right now, would you take that? He's like, yeah, I probably would take that. I go, well that's how it feels like to me. Motherfucker. Like that's how it feels like to me. Like you're a decaying old man, you know, like he's not much. I think he's a year older than me, but he looks like he's 50 years old. I mean he made his body's all humped, he's cute legs go ponch it doesn't have any muscle tone.

Speaker 4:          01:37:18       And I'm like, dude, all of that is just physical fitness. Like you're not broken. Like there's nothing wrong with you. But if you got on like a steady yoga routine and started doing some resistance training and started maybe swimming or something like that a year from now, you would have a completely different body, you know? And so talking to me, I'm like, I've done it my whole life. So like stuff that I can do stuff that you don't think is possible. And to me it's like two times a week, three times a week I do that stuff like, this is not like your body is like a race car that you can juice up yourself. Like you can add the fat tires, you can add the improved suspension, you can beef up the horsepower in the engine, you could do all that yourself. Or You could just choose to have this shitty body that's always fallen apart on you.

Speaker 3:          01:38:04       Right? I mean you're, you and I are both choosing to do as you know, we're, we're both kind of obsessed with nutrition and aging and being, you know, as, as optimal as we can in terms of our health. But ultimately what we are doing is delaying the aging process by switching on all these switches and like, you know, exercise and getting all the micronutrients and avoiding the refined sugar which is causing inflammation and, and all that stuff. And it's really because that stuff is part of the aging process and it accelerates the aging process. You know, where I don't think people that don't do this stuff realize that it's like, it's not just about looking good, it's about aging. It's about like being older and being fit and being mentally sharp and not being degenerate and decrepit and how. I mean, how awful would that be? It'd be like 60, which is young. I mean 60 is still young and to be like, you know, yeah. Broken, which is really common. It's super common, especially for sedentary people. Exactly. It's under Ip. Most sedentary people are people that also choose to eat terrible diets, so it's like not only are they sedentary, they're also eating crappy food and not getting all the nutrients they need. So it's just like this mega explosion, dynamite of just bad

Speaker 4:          01:39:22       increasing inflammation. I think intelligent people like my friend, he is intelligent and I think he connects vanity with those things and he thinks vanities for fools and he thinks it's a, it's a, it's a trait that he finds reprehensible. He just doesn't like it. He sees people that are, you know, whatever. Maybe it's flashy clothes, maybe it's the way they wear their hair, whatever it is he thinks is preposterous. He connects that with physical fitness. I'm like, man, but it's your vehicle and it's like how you get through this life and it's how you think it's, it's, it's so many different things that are all connected into one super organism, which is the life that you're living. It's, it's, you know, I mean, I think everybody knows now. I mean it's not something we grew up knowing, but everybody knows now about your gut biome.

Speaker 4:          01:40:14       This is a really huge factor in how you exist as an organism or as maybe even an organism is the wrong word because we're essentially ecosystems, you know, and we're, we're in charge. This weird consciousness that has all this resistance and has all this inclination towards comfort and fucking off and blowing things off is what is in charge of making all these things happen that keep this ecosystem healthy. It's almost like if earth itself had like a shitty manager, you know, if like there was a manager of a natural manager of earth that was like, Oh God, who cares if it rains?

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       Oh God, you know, like, let's let you know I'm, I'm going to stop growing things. I don't give a shit anymore. It's all stupid anyway. I mean it's literally like the, the, just blow it out. Fuck it. Let's just kill all the life. It's all going to die eventually. I mean, the sun only lasts 7 billion years and see that is the perspective a lot of people take with aging where it's like, well, you're going to die. You're going to age. You can't stop aging. And it's like, yes, you're right. But that's not the point. The point is to age better. Like that's the point. The point is to increase your health span, you know? And that is, we know is possible. Like that can be. There's some, there's some of these centenarians and Supercentenarians I've seen that are like in, you know, over 100 years old and they're like riding bikes and racing and it's like they're old.

Speaker 2:          01:41:43       They are very old. They're experiencing a very good quality of life and experiencing a quality of life that these other people that don't exercise feel. They physically feel their own body diminishing and they just feel it's inevitable. It's just, it is what it is. You're wasting your time. You're out there running around, but no we're not because this experience right now, it's not like no one's under the illusion that you're gonna live forever, but you are enhancing the experience that you're currently involved in right now and you are alive. You are alive. You do experience this life, but do you experience this life optimally? Is it, is it as enjoyable as it can be? And we all know that there's a spectrum for that. Enjoyability like we've all had times in our life where it's not been so great and then times in a life where everything came together like what a fucking great day, Woo.

Speaker 2:          01:42:30       Like make more of those, like you could make more of those and then the whole things better. And I think when that whole thing is better, it affects everybody. You touch everybody that's around you, everybody you come in contact with and that in turn, I mean it sounds so grandiose, but in turn can affect the entire race of human beings. I agree. Totally. Totally agree. And I love the way you put it about like the feeling good. It's not just about, you know, staving off cancer, you know, it's not just about what's going to happen 20, 30 years from now. It's about now it's about not being depressed. We know that, you know, it's about feeling better. It's about being smarter, it's about having more executive function, having more longterm planning, less emotional Amygdala, you know, anxiety that is like right here, right now that is happening.

Speaker 2:          01:43:17       That is so, you know, it's not just longterm effects which you also are, you know, also effecting which is very good. So it's like a win win. You're not just affecting the future. You're affecting right now how you feel, how you perform, you know, it's, yeah, it's an important concept that I continue to try to get across to people and it also will optimize everything else you do, whether it's creative pursuits, whether it's relationships that you get into. A lot of those things are predicated on how you feel as you enter them, how you feel when you participate in them and you can enhance, you can

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       enhance that. And I mean, there's a weird thing that people do where they want to pretend they're not trying to do better. You know, I'm fine. Everything's great. Like it's not, that's not true. You're, you're, you're putting out effort. It's a matter of you. You have a mindset or you have a connection in your brain with putting out more effort and connecting that to discomfort and that connecting things to discomfort. Have you ever, um, Steven Pressfield has a book called the war of art have brought up in this podcast a million times. I actually have a copy of it. I'll give it to you afterwards because I bought like 50 copies of it. I handed it, I handed out to people, it's great and he's been on this podcast before and his book is essentially mostly about the creative pursuit and it's about resistance that people feel when you know you should write or you know you should paint or whatever it used to sculpt whatever these things are that you pursue and that there's this thing that comes up that tries to keep you from doing that, this resistance, and he's like, this is a battle that you will fight for the rest of your life.

Speaker 1:          01:44:56       But the key is to fight it, not to give in, don't give in to that resistance to fight, just to fight that resistance and in doing so everyday you do so you have won the battle for that day and you will continue to fight that battle. And if you continue to fight that battle with that same mindset, you will win. And this is a guy that like up until the time he was 40 years old, he was basically a loser. He wasn't doing well. It was like a failed writer. And then he kind of just figured it out and got his shit together and then wrote books about it and now he's a really accomplished author and it's a, it's an amazing story and he's a really cool guy too. I had them on for a podcast and you know, in his enthusiasm and the way he approaches it in this book because it's very pragmatic, like you can see the steps and he left.

Speaker 1:          01:45:39       He lays it all out in a way that's very easy to digest. Awesome. Yeah, I'd love to read it. I mean, I, I, I think that's something that's a very important part of, um, of the human experience is pushing past that resistance to whatever. And, and you're right, it, once you do it, you get better at it next time too. I mean, it's still there, but you, you do get better at it next time. There's also a problem. I think that what it comes up when you and I are doing these podcasts where there's so much data, there is so much to take in. I mean we have done how many podcasts now? Like sixth or seventh? One a lot and every one of them is three hours of like, what the fuck, how does she know all this? And just notebooks, like when I put it up on twitter, you know, the, that you're going to be here. Everybody's like, get your notebook out. And I mean, that's like the number one response in the comments. That's awesome. Yeah. Cool. There's a lot of stuff that I, I enjoy learning, you know, so it's something that I like to learn about, um, things that can make me better or things that can make other people better mentally, physically healthy, aging and all that. So I like to

Speaker 3:          01:46:49       share that with, with people. Have you heard of this? Um, we're talking about an aging pill and it kind of came into my mind when you were talking about giving your friend that if you could take a pill I could, you know, delay the way you age or make you live. You no longer are better. Um, have you heard of like nicotinamide riboside or Nicotinamide Adenine? Dinucleotide not at all. Not at all. No. Oh Wow. It's like, it's kind of like, I guess it's maybe it's not made its way into the popular media media as much as I thought, but it's definitely blown up in the science. So, um, there's, it's so nicotinamide riboside and nicotine, my model nucleotide there, they're like precursor forums to vitamin B three and in the body they get converted into something called Nad. And Nad is something that you absolutely have your mitochondria which make energy have to have to make energy.

Speaker 3:          01:47:42       Like you can't oxidize fat, fatty acids, you can't oxidize glucose, you can't make energy from any of the food you eat without an because your mitochondria and need it to make the energy. So it's very important for your mitochondria to function, to make energy. But also, um, it's very important. It's like the levels of Nad always rise. Like when you're fasting in between meals. So like between breakfast and lunch or breakfast and dinner, whatever your nad levels go up like slowly after a meal and during the fasting state and also when you exercise. So the levels of Nad will, will, will go up somewhat. But I'm the, so these are precursors to Nad, right? I'm telling you this because this is kind of the studies that have been done. All the mechanisms go back to this forming nad nad is something that decreases with age.

Speaker 3:          01:48:31       Um, it's something that, you know, it's just, it's very important for aging. Anytime you're inflamed, all the nad gets sucked, sucked up into that inflammation because your energy to, you know, energy, it requires energy to like have your immune cells to be activated and fighting off whatever they think they're fighting off whether or not it's refined sugar or actual infection, but, um, DNA damage, sex it up. So it's like, you know, it's, it's basically a limiting factor in a lot of ways. So there's been all these studies over the past, I don't know, I'd say like six years, probably now, five or six years where various scientists are, have been, um, feeding mice. You know, this nick attendant, my driver's side or nicotine mind monitor nucleotide, and they're finding that, you know, for example, if you feed them nicotine and wide mononuclear nucleotide, um, it delays aging in their liver and their bones in their eyes, their muscle.

Speaker 3:          01:49:27       I'm there. So it's basically like their tissues are aging better, they have enhanced endurance, they have a better mitochondrial function and these are doses like human equivalent dose to like 24 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day, which could be a lot if you weigh a lot, but I'm showing that it improves mitochondrial function and nicotine riboside which gets converted into nicotinamide Adenine dinucleotide. It's kind of confusing on it just anyways. Lots of studies on that. Showing that it like if you give it to mice that have some sort of mitochondrial defect in their muscles, all atrophying, a Co completely reverses that. Their muscles are like they're making lots of Mitochondria and they're improves muscle function and enhanced performance anyways. Like you get the idea like lots and lots of animal studies. Recently there's been a human clinical trial done with nicotinamide riboside and that just to show that it's safe and that it actually does increase nad levels in, in human blood, which it does, um, even even as low as a 100 milligrams dose a day and this is a supplement that people can buy.

Speaker 3:          01:50:28       So the nicotine in my mano, nucleotide is not, that's found in Broccoli. Broccoli's really high in it. Cucumbers are really high in it. Cabbage is high and in May, but nicotine might arrive aside which gets converted into that which eventually makes its way to nad is, it is a supplement. So a few scientists actually, um, some big name scientist in the aging field, like linen warranty and a couple of others have started a supplement company called a Elisia. Come to me, me that pad, I've, I forgot to put a pad over here. I've got to write that down. Thank you. Yeah. And so it's called a lease iom and it has nicotine in them. Like the Matt Damon Movie. Yeah. E L Y S I, u m. Oh look at this. They have it. So it has nicotine in my and by the way, I know it's affiliation.

Speaker 3:          01:51:19       I don't have any affiliation with any, a supplement company. What is the company? I think it's a company called the company's called Lisa. Whereas the supplements, the supplements called Elysium. But how do you spell the actual nicotinamide? Nicotinamide, and I see a nick o, t I n a, m I d e right beside R I b o s I d e. yeah. So it's interesting. It's also there's another company I think thorne makes makes one. I'm with it in it, but born. Yeah. Thorn. The thing that's interesting about the Elysium though that I found, because I started looking into this, I've met lenny warranty. He's the guy who um, who, whose lab the whole pathway that Rivera trawl Axon was discovered that act. So Nad switches on this whole, like genetic pathway, that's like anti aging and it just changes all these epigenetic factors. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:52:18       Without getting into all the details and like boring people to death, it's like it actually, it's basically nad levels rise that acts as a switch. This rises Nad levels. So this is a supplement that's rising nad levels, but what's interesting about the illicium is that it has something in it called terrorists still being Charles still being is found in blueberries and blueberries is probably the one of the best sources of it. But what was so interesting, I was trying to figure out like why are they putting, trying to figure out why they're putting terrell still being with the nicotinamide riboside because nicotinamide riboside is affecting nad it's affecting mitochondrial biogenesis, which it's been shown to increase mitochondrial biogenesis. Like I said, these mice and mice, you know, we're, we're um, we're performing like 42 percent better at different endurance activities after being supplemented with this.

Speaker 3:          01:53:06       So that's insane. Yeah. It's. But they're giving a lot like the 32 to 24 to 32 milligrams per kilogram body weight. It would be the human equivalent dose. So you know, figure that out. That's a lot. That's probably like four grams a day or something like that. Right. For like a 160 or 80 pound person, something like that. I don't know. Anyways, the Terrell still beans interesting because, well, in and of itself, it's interesting because it's actually, it's chemically similar to raspberry trawl and um, but it's four times more bioavailable than was trial and it actually has been compared side by side in mouse studies to like to a different mouse studies that I've looked at cognitive function and it's better at improving cognitive function in animals. Then risperidol is largely because it's four times more bioavailable. Uh, so anyways, I was like, well, I don't know if that's why they're doing it because it's not affecting the same pathway.

Speaker 3:          01:54:00       But then I came across something really interesting in that is I'm terrible still being actually has been shown. Again, this is an animal study to increase the type of bacteria in the gut that causes the, um, conversion of certain compounds, Alijah Tannins, which are found in berries and some nuts, but really high and pomegranate Alijah tannins get converted into something called teros still, I mean called, um, your, uh, within a by your gut bacteria, which is what pterostilbene is increasing that gut bacteria. So Tara soybeans actually increasing the production of your urine within a from berries that are having this other compound. You're in a. What that does is this has been shown also in other studies. It causes my defeat Mito faigy or my topic g, which is the clearing away of damaged mitochondria a. So you're basically clearing away damaged mitochondria like they eat themselves.

Speaker 3:          01:54:56       So faigy would be eating itself, kind of like [inaudible] or [inaudible] as it's called, which is a self sort of a damaged cell that gets cleared away and eats itself. That happens a lot during the fasting state. Well, this Mito faigy is doing it specifically for Mitochondria and this the reason why this is so cool and I'm going to try to not bore you, but I can go on and on. I said, I'm worried about. The reason this is so cool is because. So you know, Mitochondria are very important for the way we age. It's not just muscle function, brain function. They're providing energy for everything like period, like your mitochondrial decay, you decay. That's the way it is like period. So their mitochondria as you are aging, they're decaying, they're getting damaged and all this stuff. Well, they have this whole repair system where you, where you have, um, lots of Mitochondria inside one cell, let's say you have one damage, Mitochondria and one healthy.

Speaker 3:          01:55:47       What they do is they fuse together, exchange all their content and fizz back apart. So they were kind of like repair each other. So you have a healthy one, a damaged one. The healthy one kind of mixes with the unhealthy one. And then you have to healthyish ones, right? So this is happening constantly inside every cell. If you ever, if you look at the Mitochondria, it's never like you never see Mitochondria by themselves are always like, like a network. Like they look like Vermicelli Spaghetti because they're constantly doing this. Well, if you clear away the damaged ones and you increase mitochondrial biogenesis with nicotinamide riboside. So not only are you getting rid of the damaged pool, you're now creating new ones that are like brand new, healthy, young brimming, young mitochondria like you had when you're a young person, young child. So now your, your, your pool that you're mixing with, it's like not mitochondrial biogenesis is good in and of itself because you're making new mitochondria, but having damaged one still around can still dilute the pool out, you know, it's still diluted.

Speaker 3:          01:56:45       So if you get clear out those damaged ones and you're making new ones, it's kind of like boom, you're going to get like young new mitochondria. So I think that possibly is a, another reason why they combine those. I mean it's completely speculation. I'm just. But anyways, he learned some cool shit about terrorists. You're lifting A. Yeah, my might've age is a very interesting thing, you know, exercise to some degree it can increase it. Fasting does. And why does fasting increases? Um, when you're fasting, you, you try to. So Nad levels rise, you try to, to conserve some of your energy. And the way you do that is by eating different Organelles, eating, eating the cell itself, which can then provide energy for other cells. So you. So usually what happens is fasting will selectively get rid of some of those damaged cells are damaged Mitochondria.

Speaker 3:          01:57:34       So that, that happens during, during the fasting. Does that make sense when you. Yeah, so it's interesting though that the body manages it so well that it goes after the damaged ones before I know it's, it's, well, there's lots of like molecular mechanisms that have been, you know, figured out why that is. And that's because the damage one there, their mitochondrial membrane potentials like different and it's just, it's all this complicated stuff, but it's like, it all works out perfectly where it's like these, these, these enzymes that like targeted to, to, to um, know, to basically become, um, to undergo Mito faigy. It's like they recognize this certain one with a lower membrane potential which happens to be more of a damaged mitochondria and it's just kinda like, it's kind of beautiful how it just all works out that way, you know? Um, what was I going to say? I completely like was going to say I lost my train of thought there. But um, yeah. So anyways, the fact that you can like, have new mitochondria is like pretty. I mean, that's Kinda like the big thing with, with aging and it's been that for a long time is like young new mitochondria. I know you're probably aware of this study, but they injected old mice with the blood

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       of young mice and they found that the old mice started behaving more lively and then they did the reverse. They injected the young mice with the blood of old mice and the mice struggled and, and deteriorated and now there's some crazy new startup were for was like eight grand. They fill you up with a blood of young people. Okay. I'm glad you mentioned that recently. Actually. I know Peter Teal, the paypal. Yes, he does that. He's he. He's the guy that he's. He's on trump's board now, isn't he? Yeah. He's like one of the first people that trump hired, which is fascinating. So fascinating. Yeah. Yeah, he does. He's talked about how he's like, he gets blood injections. Okay. So here's, what has he said about it? I don't remember exactly what, just that. I don't think he said anything about whether it's doing anything, but I think let's just start showing up younger.

Speaker 1:          01:59:34       Well, now he's got a snapchat filter on. Well, here's the thing that was really interesting about this whole thing because I've been following this field for awhile too, because I find it very interesting for multiple reasons. One, it's like it could be applicable, right? I mean easily, but various look at him. Look, looks young as fuck. He's nine years old. Wants inject himself with young people's blood or is doing it. Trump delegate and gawker bankrupt or. Oh yeah, he's the guy who, he, he financed whole cogans attack on Gawker because gawker outed him as being. Did they outed him as gay or they attacked him and they, they got really shitty with him and you know, he's a fucking billionaire. So he went off and um, thank you for turning off your ad blocker. Enjoy the Forbes ad light experience. Flutter off Nick Denton files for personal bankruptcy.

Speaker 1:          02:00:27       Yeah, he, uh, he went after that guy because of it. Yeah. Um, so when you go back to the other article, I want to change the articles there. Um, so what he's doing a given fields obsession with warding off death. It comes as no surprise to silicon valley billionaire is interested in lease one radical way of doing it, injecting himself with a young person's blood. Wow. INC magazine published part of a year old interview with thiel and which the venture capitalists explains that he's interested in power of biosis twist called, which includes the practice of getting transfusions of blood from a younger person as a means of improving health and potentially reversing aging. Said, I'm looking into this stuff. I think it's really interesting. Blah, blah, blah, blah. It's unclear whether the 48 year old entrepreneur is currently receiving. Guaranteed you is, um, reports that are fuel capital employee.

Speaker 1:          02:01:21       Actually the personal health director has a personal health director, personal health director to Peter Thiel. That's hilarious. That's what you do when you're all baller. I'm going to get a personal health director is the same company. Ambrosia LLC. This is the one that we were talking about the other day. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. So this is actually happening. Says thiel spends $40,000 per quarter per quarter to get an infusion of blood from an 18 year old based on research conducted at Stanford on extending the lives of mice. So he's got one fucking 18 year old that he's vampiress one kid. He's given them beats and Broccoli sprouts and making them run up hills.

Speaker 1:          02:02:05       That's what you would have to hope that kids not doing meth, you know, like he's got this 18 year old. All these biomarkers in the blood, I would imagine. Yeah, because you have to make sure. I mean, that's so weird. We're going to farm off young people and. Oh Wow. That is so crazy. He's given $6,000,000 to biomedical. Jen, gerontologist, traumatologists all opry to gray. That crazy fucker. I had him on it. I had him on my podcast too. Yeah, he's interesting. But he drinks. He boozes like every night. He was like three in strong at 11 in the morning when I walked into his office. He. Yeah, that's what I was saying when I was hanging out with them. He's like, well, he, he's basing all of. He's putting all of his eggs in the basket of science. He thinks that science and things like with Peter thiels doing it's going to be able to mitigate all this stuff that he's doing, but I'm like, dude, you're fucking stuck in a position where it's like, okay, they can delay the aging, but like you're stuck like now, okay, you can't make you like 18, but we can stop you from dying, but you know, so it's like, that's possible.

Speaker 1:          02:03:10       So He's going to be stuck. Like, well, he also does an exercise. I found him to be perplexing. I really enjoyed talking to him, but I found him to be quite perplexing because of the booze and because of the lack of exercise and his big fucking crazy gandalf beard. Like what's going on with you? Dude? There's a lot going on here and like this is. There's a lot, a lot of image here, you know, disagree on a lot of nutrition. Oh well hold on a second, let me talk about that. But in some say that the pay to participate study with the potential to collect up to four point 8 million from as many as 600 participants as mounts to a scam.

Speaker 1:          02:03:45       What certain is, it's based on some intriguing if inconclusive science, a car, maisie in a 32 year old Princeton graduate and competitive rower said he was inspired by studies on mice. That research it's sewn together with their veins conjoined in a procedure called Para biosis. Okay. That's what we're talking about. That study about mice. So what did you guys disagree with? Um, well, just the role that nutrition plays in aging. So he didn't think it was a big role. We didn't think it was a big race. He's boozing. Yeah, it in. He's not working out. I mean, how can you ignore all the science on the positive benefits of exercise and nutrition? Oh, there's lots of studies showing that that diet and lifestyle, you know, have a huge impact on, on aging. I mean, just one more thing about this pair biosis there because it's kind of.

Speaker 1:          02:04:31       People were thinking that it was the young. There was something in the young blood that was, um, present the 11 that it just said on the screen. That was actually 11. What does that, right, it's a growth factor. 11. Yeah. So it was thought that this was what was responsible for rejuvenating tissues and growing new brain cells because that's what happened when you gave it to the, um, older mice. But then other studies started to come out also out of Stanford showing that in fact, it may not be something that's in the young blood, but something that's in the old blood that's actually causing the aging, something called a v Cam, one that starts to, you start to make it as you're getting older and it causes inflammation in the brain and starts messing up things. So there was a recent study that just came out and show that if you like, make an antibody against that v Cam one and prevent it from doing its action.

Speaker 1:          02:05:23       It's like you can stop that from happening. So anyways, there's a lot to be figured out, body that they're currently working on. They're trying to make some kind of some, some something that you can take God damn solution that was going to be weird. It's going to be weird if you see like old people become young, it's not going to be weird if people don't get any older will be kind of weird. But like if I came, I ran into you like 20 years from now I'm like Damn Rhonda, you exactly the same. It will be cool, but it wouldn't freak me out. What would freak me out of Arnold Schwartzenegger started looking like it was when he was 20 again. Like that would freak me out. Like if we start seeing the change in the process, we started seeing things reverse, not just halt or slow down, which we kind of have seen with like really healthy people.

Speaker 1:          02:06:08       Like some people know, some people kind of defy aging least to a certain extent. Like Tom Cruise is a perfect example. I want to know what they're filling that dude up with. Who else? I think who I was thinking that defied aging like famous wise, Keanu reeves. I feel like that guys look the same for like a long time. Yeah. And he's in his fifties now. He looks great. He looks great and I think he smokes too. Yeah, no, yes. Yeah. So that's, that's just show you. He's got some kind of like genetic there are. There definitely are Tom Cruise 1983, 2014. They're injecting him with some kind of young fluid. No, I'm sorry. I'm, I mean look, he's got fucking ungodly sums of money and that's part of a part of the issue, you know, I mean they've uh, they that you can definitely do things with money that badge and make you look younger.

Speaker 1:          02:07:05       Trying to figure out what surgery wise and stuff. I don't think he's doing surgery though. No, no. Well I don't. One of the things that they think is a. What does that picture up above? What's that one with the shirt off? One up there. Is that him working out of there? See that chose aging. So one on the right, like he's got substantially less tone to his muscles, but that could just be. He's been busy. Says the maverick days are over, hold on, go back. What does that say? Is it from 1986 to right on the set yesterday? So yeah, that's also that there's not that much of a variability there that could easily be, just hasn't been working out as hard. I mean when you're on a movie set, you're working 15, 16 hours a day sometimes. Especially these gigantic big budget budget blockbusters where you're, you know, involved in these crazy stunts and all that stuff. So interesting.

Speaker 3:          02:08:00       Yeah. Um, but you know, back to this like diet aging thing that like Aubrey and I just read on, I mean it's, it's so, it's so weird that someone that's he's familiar with the aging literature would, would disagree with, with some of the science out there. Like there's been studies looking at, for example, people that have like 1:12 ounce can of like sugar water or sugar soda, some kind of sugary drink a day. They have, if you look at them, their telomeres in their white blood cells. So telomeres are a biomarker for aging. When you look at their team number link, their telomeres are shorter compared to people that don't have that soda every day and that corresponds to like four point six years of biological aging. I mean that's like someone that's the same exact age as you, but has a team member that looks, you know, either five years older, younger, same. Yeah. It's totally insane. All, all based off of like this refined sugar soda.

Speaker 1:          02:08:57       I wonder if it's all a personal thing with him because he knows that he's not addressing that and his own life. Maybe that's why he's decided to put up these blinders and ignore the science.

Speaker 3:          02:09:05       Well, I think also he's interested in extending lifespan to like a massive point.

Speaker 1:          02:09:10       Sugary soft drinks may be linked to accelerate a DNA aging study. So he's. I mean, like I said, he's putting all his eggs in the basket of science just of who knows. I mean there's, it's, it's kind of interesting that he is doing that though because he will concentrate very heavily on that. And again, when you were talking about all this nutrition and exercise, the benefits of it like, God, there's so much to study, there's so much that it maybe his, maybe his desire to shoe that and go straight to the science of it only and talk about genetic manipulation and all these other different variables. Like maybe, maybe there's something to that. Maybe you really can't spend enough time in both fields.

Speaker 3:          02:09:55       Totally. Yeah, I think that makes sense. And I, and I do think that there's hope for, you know, things like genetic engineering and stem cell therapies that will help tune humans up eventually. And that will make a big difference in.

Speaker 1:          02:10:08       Have I talked to you about my stem cell experiments? No. No. Okay. I have been getting stem cell shots. I got them for an injured shoulder to shoulder that. Um, I had a rotator cuff tear, biceps tendon tear and labral tear in my shoulder and it was most likely had been dislocated before and I didn't know which is just the side effects of years of doing difficult stuff with your. Especially Jujitsu. Jujitsu is all about joint manipulations and joint locks. And Chokes and grappling and there's a lot of, just a lot of damage that your body goes through. Everybody and I know that does Jujitsu at a certain point in time either has to get some form of surgery or has some pretty significant injuries that they have to work around. So, uh, I, he, um, went to a doctor that was like, well, you probably have to get surgery, like this is gonna if, if not now, sometime really soon because every time I would work out and we get really sore and I'd have to ice it afterwards, I get these shots and they're doing them from the, they're extracting the stem cells from women's placenta and they take the stem cells and then they shoot them into the area where you have the injury and the results are fucking freakish.

Speaker 1:          02:11:22       You heal like wolverine. I mean it's really bizarre. And now this same shoulder that I had, you know, like a real problem with, I was worried about needing surgery. I do 90 pound presses with kettlebells with one shoulder and it's not, have no pain, no pain, no discomfort. It's not bothering me at all and it's, it's unbelievable how much strength and function that the shoulder has now. That's really cool. I didn't realize they were doing that with placental stem cells. Placental stem cells are like, kind of like a goldmine because they, um, they possess a tap of stem cell called multiphoton stem cell, which is able to form multiple different types of cartilage cells that form cartilage cells that form bone, even cells that form neurons, so they're able to form lots of different types of cells. Um, and usually placenta just like thrown away.

Speaker 1:          02:12:14       So that's kind of cool that they're, I guess there's companies that are freezing them down and I'm finding donors that match. Yeah. Let me tell you the name of the company. So people who are listening, it's in the. My doctor's name is Dr Roddy Mcgee and he's in Las Vegas and the company is a listed here. That's good. I've got it on my instagram and my pen ready here to let me know. I won't let you down. Just give me a second. I'll scroll through my instagram and I'll find him because it wasn't that long ago that I was there, but, um, I, uh, I posted something about it on Instagram, but I am a, I'm a believer in it and I've had some friends, my friend John Dudley who's an archer, was experiencing a tendinitis in one of his elbows for a long time. I mean he had it and it was something that he had been working through for quite a few years and he had one stem cell shot and within two weeks the pain was completely gone. It was just, yeah, it's freaky what they're able to do. I'm fine to get stem cell therapies. I mean, that's something that I'm extremely excited about for the future. But have you ever tried a hydrolyzed collagen powder or like bone broth? Yes, I drink bone broth every morning. I love them. So, um, that, that's another thing like, because I,

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       I've been getting into the bone broth, but I was doing hydraulic add, hydrolyzed collagen powder to like my coffee in the morning and also my smoothies. Then what does that do? Well, it's this, it's just like a, it's got a lot of the same things. Is Bone broth bone broth? Probably actually even better because it has more stuff, but it's been shown in animal studies. If you take the hydrolyzed collagen powder and like radio label it so you can follow where it goes and an animal. It goes right to the cartilage in the joints and ligaments. Um, I used it. It has helped me heal like injured wrist, you know, obviously like my injuries are like way, way, like less magnitude and something that you're experiencing in your shoulder. It is a total sports medicine in Vegas. That's the name of the company that, that.

Speaker 2:          02:14:15       Does this stem cell injections or that. What about the company that you applied? Biologics. It's called a flow graft. Amniotic fluid therapy, that's what they're calling it a, but it's total sports medicine in Las Vegas. That's where I got the stem. So biologics, is that the company that freezes the Placenta? Yes. Applied biologics flow graft, amniotic fluid therapy. And um, my friend, uh, Rodney Mcgee, Dr Rodney Mcgee is a total sports medicine in Vegas. He's awesome. He's such a knowledgeable guy too. If you ever wanted to talk to him, I get you in contact with them and he can explain all the details. He talks like you took a fucking geek out together and confuse the shit out of anybody standing next to you. Well, you know, pretty soon they actually there you can make stem cells from skin cells now. Yeah, I've heard that. I know they did that with a woman.

Speaker 2:          02:15:02       They created a new bladder for her. She had bladder cancer and they created a completely new bladder from her skin cells in a laboratory environment and then replaced her, her damaged bladder. That's amazing. I had only heard about the clinical study that they did with [inaudible] where like the woman, some woman was, had some sort of blindness and they were able to use skin cells from her own skin. You know, clocks. I'm into becoming retinal cells, but bladder is really cool too. I mean, so there's these lots and lots of animals studies, but every once in a while there's like a new clinical study where they're just kind of piloting, you know, doing this and seeing the safety in, in humans and that is where I'm like, I can't wait like it's crazy stem cell injections for my brain, you know, I'm shooting her rent money or it's going to be very bizarre when we get past a healthy human state.

Speaker 2:          02:15:56       That's what I'm really not just concerned, not concerned about rather, but curious about like it's curious, it's not even a strong enough word, but I feel like within our lifetimes, maybe it's 50 years or whatever it's going to be, they're going to be able to engineer a human body to perform and I'm sure you're aware of myostatin inhibitors and the benefits that they've shown that the accidental ones that they've done with like whippets and cows, but now they've started to do it on purpose for mice and they're, the mice are living longer. They're super nice. They're are like way more muscular.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       I think they're like two to three times more muscular than the average mouse. They look freakish when they kill them. When they killed him and they skin them and they show the body of the miles compared to with the muscle structure and comparison to the body of a natural mouse. It's like, what in the fuck are you doing here? Like this is, this is like the hulk. It's like you're making a, a tiny thing, you know, and you're putting all this extra muscle on it and for whatever reason it's living longer. Yeah. That is, that's the interesting part that it's living longer. Trying to figure that out. Like what you know, because usually there's some sort of trade off where you're like, well, let's see if we could find that. Jamie, the thing, the Mile Staton inhibitor studies they did on mice because their physical performance was extraordinary.

Speaker 1:          02:17:12       Like they could do things that the other mice just could not do, but on top of that they actually live longer. Yeah, that's, that's very interesting. I know they were doing it with like pigs too or something. I seen some pigs or they'd done since, I think they were doing gene engineering on them with the and inhibitor. But yeah, it's all, it's all very interesting. They've done it with animals that you use. I mean they're, they're thinking that you could do it with animals that we use for food and they would just, they would provide more meat that way, which is kind of interesting. But what's man exactly what. I found some, a couple of different studies. Some were older than like 10 years, so I don't know. Oh, okay. It's cliche. Muscle mass and muscle fiber in aged mice, but does not increase bone density or bone strength. Huh? Be a problem. Snap. That's an old study. The [inaudible] from 2009. It's 2013 is the one I clicked on. Interesting. Uh, maybe 2013 is probably where I saw it. But the, some of those images click on those images, Jamie, because some of those images, um, you could see they had the like go down there with the mice carcasses right there. I can see the difference in the size and no, that's not it. It's not necessarily a, I think it's actually the one where you made. Was that

Speaker 5:          02:18:30       uh hm.

Speaker 1:          02:18:32       Well there's plenty to look at, but yeah, there it is. You could see the difference in the muscle size from the average mouse, which is on the left versus the milestone and mouse, the milestone knockout mouse. But look at what they're standing there. That one mouse just looks like a giant ass power lifter mouse. These are strange times when it comes to the science. Really strange times. I mean, muscle mass is, that's exactly what I saw. That's exactly the one that I saw

Speaker 5:          02:19:02       pool. Good Lord. It's incredible.

Speaker 1:          02:19:07       I mean, you've got like two levels of it. You've got level one, level a, and level b. you've got the natural mouse, which is on the left. What is this image? What does this, uh, image title, Jamie. Sorry. Okay. Bodybuilding and Myostatin. And there's an image of three mice. One is a control, which is the average mouse. The other ones has dominant negative. Uh, how does that work? Go at Trib Trib two eyes, uh, and the other one is follow staten and in the false downton want it is just a fucking Lee Haney of mice, you know, that's a giant ass mouse. It's ridiculous. It's like double the size of the middle mouse, which is double the size of the other mount. Either of those pathways are or what they do, but clearly they regulate muscle mass was going on. That would be kinda weird to like do an injection and like all of a sudden you're gaining lean muscle mass without like doing not doing anything.

Speaker 1:          02:20:02       Yeah. It doesn't look like those mice are working out. No. That would be super weird. You know, that would, I don't know. Well that's one of the misconceptions about steroids. You know, people think like you do. Steroids just get bigger and muscular. You actually have to work it out. What this is a guy says is a milestone. This is bullshit. This is bullshit. This is just don't even click on that can take that fucking off. That's lies that these goddamn supplement companies that do that, that's really gross. One of the things they do is they pay someone to get in really great shape so someone gets in really great shape, like they'll give them steroids, they'll pump them up and then they pay him to get fat. So they pay him to stop working out, they get fat and then they changed the way the lighting is like.

Speaker 1:          02:20:42       One of the things that you could see when you're dealing with fraudulent companies is, uh, these shirt off picks before and after what a transformation is like in the, the good picture there, Tan and the lighting is really good for accentuating muscle. Uh, you know, the, the shape of the muscles and the shadows and everything. They look ripped. And then the other one, they're like pasty and white and they pay these guys to get fat. A friend of mine, they paid him to do it. Yeah. These things right here. Like that guy on the right, the after is the fucking before. And the guy on the left that before is they paid that guy to stop working out and give facts. People live with themselves. Like doing that. Like I just don't. It seems like people are douchebags fraudulent. There's a lot of monsters out there.

Speaker 1:          02:21:27       This is from bigger, stronger, faster. I think this was actually taken like the same day. Oh, what did some photoshop they do that. They do that too, for sure. They definitely do that too. And um, our friend Chris Bell and Mark Bell who were in bigger, stronger, faster, you know, they know a lot more about that than we do. Then there's a picture of him right above that that if you haven't seen that documentary, I highly recommend it bigger, stronger, faster, which talks about the supplement industry and the use of steroids and all these different things. But that's one of the interesting. Yeah, it's one of the weird practices they do, like if you look at any of those before and after pictures, it's mostly what you're seeing. I mean, unless they're like a really ethical company and they hired someone to take their product and continue to work out. But even then it's like when you show a before and after, what was the guy doing before? What was the guy doing after? How much of that has diet? How much that is exercise, like how do you know, you know, did you get a blood test on this guy? Is he on steroids? Like what? What's, what's happening here? Yeah. I think we should just focus on

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       ways we can actually. Yeah, science and ways we know like we can increase muscle mass, you know, obviously, you know, weight lifting and I don't mean to beat up on Aubrey de grey, but when you, when you brought up the science of nutrition and the factors, you know, the, the, the positive benefits of it. Like what was his reaction and what episodes of this podcast, the podcast that I did, I can't remember what episode, but it's been a year and a half. At least I would say. Um, I can't remember his exact reaction. I mean, you can tell if you listen to the pot I talk, I talk a lot about, we talk a lot about crispr and stem cell and a lot of these possible therapies that are being used that can potentially extend lifespan. But there's a point in the podcast where nutrition comes up and you can tell it gets a little awkward between the two of us because we kind of have different viewpoints and I'm, I'm sort of not trying to be rude because look at them, they're fucking wizard.

Speaker 2:          02:23:26       We were like so close and his office and he's anyways, he's an odd guy. That beard is fucking awesome though. God Damn that point was just that you can't, you're not gonna, you're not gonna extend lifespan by, you know, 40 or 50 percent with diet and that's what he wants to do. Right. And that's fair. But the point that I think, you know, it's, it's one thing to say that and another thing to kind of disregard nutrition altogether, you know, because that's because that's just stupid nutrition plays a role in the way you age. And so I think that should be, you know, it shouldn't be something that people should completely disregard, disregard and not think about and not. And not even not thinking about. But when they talk publicly, talk it down. Like, I don't like that. Like that's fine. If you want to focus on technologies and, and I agree with that, I mean I'm, I'm all about, you know, all these gene therapy technologies and crispr and you know, induced pluripotent stem cells and I'm a huge, huge fan of all that, but I don't think that being a fan of that and being excited about what the science and what new technologies are, are gonna be able to bring us, should, you know, make us talk about like kind of poop on nutrition, right?

Speaker 2:          02:24:39       Watching the also a big factor is the way you feel and a big factor too. I mean, I assume they just doesn't just want to extend a shitty life, right? You want to extend a life where you feel wonderful, right? Right. And well if your booze and all the time like he is that guy boozes every day. I talked to him like we were drunk as fuck in New York. I went to that. Um, what is it, 2045 conference. Uh, there's a, a conference in New York where all of these nutty people who think you're going to be able to download your brain into a super computer and the year 20, 45 like this extended life conference and a lot of it was run by this Russian billionaire that I talked to, which was, who was a very odd character, but he was building a robot that they

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       were not satisfied with the results of this robot. So they, uh, they never a unearthed it. They never unveiled it rather. But these all these people is 20, 45 conference in New York. We're all like this gathering of these super geeks that are all in various ways trying to extend life. And Aubrey de Grey was there as well and I met him at the bar and we just got fucking hammered. We got hammered and we're talking. I'm like, is, are we extending life that's going on? It feels like we're just drinking guinness. You are causing massive inflammation. Brain cell death. This is terrible. What are we doing? But you know, those are two very contrary ways of existing to, to extend life. But yet to diminish the potential of the life you're currently experiencing, but, you know, I guess he's having fun,

Speaker 2:          02:26:14       you know? Yeah. I don't, you know, he was an interesting guy and I enjoyed talking to him, but I don't want to talk bad about him. But when I was very shocked when I walked into his office that literally like 11 in the morning and he had already down two beers and you respond is third. And I was just like, I didn't, I wasn't expecting that. I wasn't. I mean, it was completely shocking to me. God bless him out there hammering it. Who knows? Yeah. Yeah. But I guess there's a lot of different approaches and I think he's, his approach is welcomed. It's interesting. It's an, it's, it's just as important to have a guy like that that's kind of fucking up his body and still still after it. Like, it's, it's interesting, right? Um, you know this, like I was saying though, the thing that with him and I, you know, the, the major differences is focusing on nutrition and that's something that, um, that I want to get the message across that I want something to do right now.

Speaker 2:          02:27:12       So maybe you can do right now until an end. In the meanwhile still telling people about the awesome science coming out. But until then, let's keep, let's keep it going. They're not mutually exclusive. They're not, they're not mutually exclusive. The other, you know, one of the things that when we were talking about the muscle mass, I started thinking about this time restricted eating. Have you heard about this at all time? Restricted eating a little bit, like eating within a certain time period. That correlates, corresponds to like the day it has really profound effects on muscle mass without any other factors that having to exercise or anything. That's something that's extremely interesting. Interesting. But this time restricted eating is, it's very important for, for health and metabolism. It's also something I've been obsessed with since like probably early summer I've been doing it like just, you know, really fanatically making sure that I'm eating within like uh, uh, no more than 12 hour period. I try to do like 10 hours. So like when you wake up in the morning, you have a cup of coffee or you know, you eat even a cup of black coffee, the first thing you put into your system that's not

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       water starts all these metabolic enzymes start some in your liver, your gut starts using these enzymes and those enzymes are on a clock because humans are diurnal creatures where we're meant to be awake and working and active and thinking during the day and we sleep at night, which is different from nocturnal creatures like some rodents and other animals that are, you know, sleep during the day and, or night. So because we're men, we are active during the day. We're diurnal, all these, all of our metabolism, metabolism, enzymes and all these things are active during the day. Um, and things that activate them are light, light exposure and also food intake. And xenobiotic is also something, so anything that gets metabolized like buyer buyer system by your liver, whatever activates these enzymes and once they're activated, they're on this like 12 hour clock where it's like, okay, so you're metabolizing glucose, fatty acids, all these things, you know, well if you're eating within that 12 hour clock, but when you go beyond that 12 hour clock, that's when things start to go really wrong because your metabolism enzymes start to shut down and they're not doing things properly.

Speaker 3:          02:29:28       So you're not like insulin responsive, you're not even fatty acids and things like that. Just metabolism in general is not working as well, you know, after 12 hours. And so that's kind of a big eyeopener. I know there was, um, a lot of people think they eat 12 hour time period. Like if you were to survey them, like, Oh yeah, I don't eat more than 12 hours. But there's actually a study done by a friend of mine who's a expert in this field. He's at the Sulk Institute. His name is satchin panda. I'm very good scientists. I interviewed him on my podcast and he's done a lot of research on this, this topic, and he did the human study where he had like this app where people logged there, they took pictures of the food that they ate and it like, you know, sent it to some database they had and it had a timestamp on it so they could see when the clock, when they, when their first cup of coffee or whatever was in the morning, and then when they were eating.

Speaker 3:          02:30:19       And I turned out most people were actually eating in a 15 hour clock. So they were having their cup of coffee, you know, at eight, seven in the morning. And they were, you know, they're eating at like nine, nine, 10, 10:00. Yeah. So they're eating much later. Um, the, the thing is, is that when you do that, you start to gain more, more fat. You start to become more insulin insensitive and you start to like, your muscle starts to waste regardless of what you eat, regardless of what you eat. So, so okay. No, I take that back. So you, if you eat healthy, if you eat healthy, so if you're eating a terrible diet, if you're eating a terrible diet, and this has been shown in mice like Lard, fat plus sugar, those two together, which is the actual bad combination, but you brought that up and I'm gonna make a note to keep those two are the bad combination. So if you eat, if you're eating that, if you're feeding the mice that and you let them eat whenever they want so they can eat their nocturnal, but I'm just going to call it day and their day is actually night. Just know that that's true. If they're eating

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       during the day and night, they gain like, you know, tons of ways to come. Fat become like, you know, type two diabetic, fatty liver. I mean they're just a mess. They're breaking down like, like earlier than they should. But if you eat normal, so if you're eating a healthy diet that's not high fat, high sugar, you don't necessarily, you're not necessarily gonna gain more fat, you don't, you don't become type two diabetic and all that. If you're not eating all the crap. So you probably just going to be okay, but if you take that same mouse who eating a healthy diet and you make it eat within a time restricted window of at least 12 hours, actually the best wisdom, nine to 10, they gain way more muscle mass. This is on a normal diet, just way more muscle mass. And if they ate within a nine hour window they had like a really improved endurance.

Speaker 2:          02:32:08       That's something I've noticed in myself. I eat within a nine hour window and I go for a run the next morning. My endurance is like very noticeably improved, like extremely noticeably improved. So do you have like a timer or like how do you do, do you time yourself at the beginning of your day? Like when you first eat and then. Yeah. So I typically will make. So my friend Kevin rose has an APP that like um, it's called darn what did he. Kevin rose has an APP. Yeah. Yeah, I've had them on. I love that guy. Yeah, he's awesome. He just cute agenda proponent as well. Yeah. He doesn't actually do Keto anymore because it's uh, after he got a bunch of blood work done and I mean there's, there's different, you know, genes that people have that can affect the way they respond to that sort of diet.

Speaker 2:          02:32:53       Most of the time people can respond good, but there's a dizzy was on here just one of them long ago introducing zero that's app to help you fast. So he has an app that helps you do that. That actually works really well. Personally, what I do is I'm just kind of crazy about it and I just remember it that day. So I'm like, okay, I had my first cup of coffee at 8:00 AM, but his app actually is really cool because it really helps you keep dragging. It sends you reminders so like helps you. And it's a free app. So powerful. Kevin rose. Anyways, it's really cool because you can just like literally these mice were gaining more muscle mass just not by doing anything but eating within this time restricted window. And um, the thing that was also very interesting about this was that, um, you could cheat a couple of days a week so they could like, like let's say weekends when you have like social events and you're like out drinking or whatever, you can, you can cheat two nights and still have the same benefits so that at least in mice, we don't know if that's the same for humans.

Speaker 2:          02:33:53       Sachin's doing, trying to aggregate some data with humans. He actually has an ongoing trial that anyone can sign up for. Um, it's called my circadian clock and it's an also an app on his phone that you just basically all you do is sign a consent form, take pictures of your food and uh, and like allow certain data, you know, different, different fitness data for them to collect. And so they're doing this clinical study, humans from data that they're aggregating, which is kind of cool. Jen is fasting tracker right now. Yeah. And you can do, he has different options for Kevin's fasting. It's like the circadian option, which is the one I'm talking about. And then there's like people that are doing intermittent fasting and what's the circadian option? That's the time restricted eating. That's certainly. That's just basically circadian is the circadian clock you're on.

Speaker 2:          02:34:39       So that's what. It's this 24 hour cycle day, day night cycle. So eating within at least a 12 hour window is so 12 hour is the most you ever most. So if you get up at 8:00 in the morning and that's when you have your first cup of coffee, that's when it starts. Not with food. It starts with First Cup of coffee. Because that's interesting because a lot of people don't think that they think that they're still fast and they have a cup of coffee and then they go run. That's the thing. I'm so because coffee, even if it's black, so people think if they have black coffee, they're fasting and they go run. But black coffee is caffeine is a xenobiotic. It's something that has to be metabolized by liver enzymes. Your gut processes it. So anything that happens in water, exactly. Anything other than water.

Speaker 2:          02:35:20       And the same goes for like taking vitamin pills and drinking herbal tea late at night, like the same, the same thing goes. Even herbal tea. Herbal tea is also got irb stuff in it. So Kevin non-caffeinated herbal tea. Yeah. Because those are xenobiotics camomile. I mean that stuff's got to be processed by your liver, your gut. It's not, it's not water. You know. So I mean, and this is something that's kind of a big question and that is, well, if the fascinate, let's say you're, you're eating within a nine hour window or 10 hour window is optimal. Nine hours is really what I found to be optimal for endurance in terms of the animal studies, like 10 hours. Also if they eating their healthy diet within 10 hours, they still had um, they increase their lean muscle mass. They didn't have to do anything else. No extra exercising it just because what was happening is they were, they were basically, I'm, their mitochondria are working better and they were also.

Speaker 2:          02:36:16       I'm getting rid of fat easier. So you know, so it increased their lean muscle mass. That's incredible because I, I late at night all the time. Well you're a comedian. I mean that's probably, you probably eat after a show or something. He came home last night at 2:00 in the morning, pigged out after a show. I mean it was healthy food. I like Kiefer and pistachio nuts. I buy those big jugs of shelled pistachios shells, so I just eat like piles of pistachios because I feel like I'm not eating anything bad. That's good for you. But this knowledge now knowing this, I'm going to. I'm going to cut that out now. Please let me know how that goes. I'm going to start right now. Yeah, that's awesome. I mean, like I said, you can cheat. There is cheating at least in mice twice. Twice a week was okay.

Speaker 2:          02:37:01       Two Times a week is a good cheat. Yeah. And that's kind of cool because it's like a weekend. Right? Right. You know, so you have your social event it, it's hard to do with social events and stuff. If you have like something late and you kind of have to fast are all early in the morning all the way up and so you can do it later, you know what I mean? But I do a lot of workouts fasted now and one of the things that I like to do is I'd get up in the morning without having anything and then I work out. But I've been having coffee so I, I thought I was fasting. He will see. The thing is, and this is kind of what I was talking with Satya and about, is that it's, if you're fasting itself, the fasting itself is having a positive effect on all these enzymes.

Speaker 2:          02:37:38       So maybe there's some sort of canceled out. It's not, not, it's not as good. Not as good I would say. So just water. We don't have actual empirical data on that saying, okay, well you know, and that's something that Satya and would like to look at and humans because it's like a big question. What if you are just fasting, uh, in the bay? In theory it's not, you're starting all those clocks. The clocks are difficult. Caffeine starts the clocks that's around so, but then again, you know, like I said, fasting changes your metabolism in a way too. That makes it better. So maybe it's not quite as bad. Not quite as bad, but not as formal. Exactly. I like that. That's perfect. Yeah. So shoot for nine hours. That was like that nine hours is the best, especially for endurance, like enhancements, like really. So if you get up and you're at, you know, you're up at 8:00 in the morning or 7:00 in the morning, whatever it is, you almost have to eat dinner like at five.

Speaker 2:          02:38:35       Yeah, that's the problem. You have to, you have to either fast in the morning where you have to eat early, which is really hard for working people nine to fivers yeah, I mean it's like you're eating breakfast before you go to work unless you're not right now. And that's kind of the problem for people that are going, you know, humans, we have, you know, life is kind of different now, but it's, you know, there are people that we're talking about you, they just take their breakfast to work and they wait so they'll wait till like 10:00 to eat or something like that because also there's people that like to go to the gym after work and so that's more time. It's like you gotta get a racist clock, I got to eat, you know, so really if you can start the clock later, if that's possible for people that are working like that, they don't have flexible hours, um, then then it would be better to start the clock later.

Speaker 2:          02:39:22       And there's a lot of human data on this, like just looking at like the associations between people that eat within an 11 hour period and fast for 13 hours. For example, women that do that, that have already had breast cancer, they reduced their breast cancer risk recurrence by like 40 percent, you know? Wow. Yeah. Because it lowers, it, it, it causes insulin sensitivity, it lowers igf one levels. I mean, it's just like, it lowers all these hormones and things that are known to promote cancer growth. It's really a powerful thing and improves metabolism, really improves metabolism and that's something that um, a couple of scientists that I've talked to that are at UCFC are looking at and actively seeing that it just, it seems to be really important. And obviously people doing shift work, like nurses are kind of. I mean that's the problem. The other kind of fucked when you're doing that late shift stuff and they are there. They have twice the cancer incidents like

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       yeah, twice, twice shift workers. They're also much more likely to be type two diabetic. You know, it's because you're eating, you're eating. Like when you're at night, you're eating, you know, your metabolism is all screwed up. Not only are you like when you're eating after the 12 hour clock are you not as insulin sensitive and so your blood glucose levels are higher also. You're confusing your clock. So it Kinda like it says, okay, I'm restarting now because it's late. I'm getting my first signal in its after it's been after 12 hours. And it confused it, so then when you go to sleep, say you eat at two in the morning and go to sleep and you wake up the next morning and you have your meal, it's already going to have started that clock a while ago, so you won't be as insulin sensitive because the earlier in the day you're the more the more insulin sensitive you are.

Speaker 3:          02:41:00       So you know what I mean? So you kind of like confused in the clock. It's like this. I'm a very complicated but I think important mechanism and system for people to understand and time restricted time restricted eating, like I have really implemented that because I think that's something that also will affect the aging process. I've talked to people like at conferences I've given a talk at that have come up to me afterwards and there they were talking about how they've been on a ketogenic diet for two years and how it would reverse your type two diabetes. It's been great, but still their fasting blood glucose levels were still in the high end, you know, even though they're no longer a type two diabetic, which is really good. And they started doing the time restricted eating or they're eating within a nine hour window and it completely resolved.

Speaker 3:          02:41:45       It, completely resolved it and it actually had multiple people tell me that. And so the amazing thing is the increase in muscle, the muscle is really the increase, the, the interesting part. I would like to like talk to such and more about that and have him do more experiments of possible, uh, because we didn't dive as much into that on the podcast and we chatted, but he is such a phenomenal scientist and he's very, uh, proactive and into health and all this, you know, preventative medicine and he's just a great, great person at the salk institute in La Jolla. Very prestigious place to be. It's a lot of really good scientists there. Jude, do your podcast with him through skype or did you know? I met with him there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I usually try to, um, I like to meet with people when I, when I interviewed them, so, so I, uh, I've noticed so I can't have done skype ones and they're just, it's like there's a disconnect. There's something missing. Yes. It was nice for you is you actually have a studio and people come to your studio. So right now I'm, I'm like going around to institutes and what, you know, if I'm at a place where I'm giving a talk and I'm like this great scientist there, I'm going to ask people to, to intervene. How do you suppose name s a t a c h I n Satchin Panda. He is a great name. Actually his first name is such and to Nanda, that's his, because he's Indian, so we shortened to Satchin

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       but he's um, he's a really good person to talk to you too. Like he is very uh, you know, just, he speaks eloquently. He explained things well. He's a little bit of an Indian accent, but you know, it's just, it's kind of like cute, but his science has changed my life. Like, Oh yeah, all my circadian knowledge. I've, I've, I've been following him for a few years. I've really looked up to him for if in fact I don't even know if I told them this, but I was interested in doing a post doc with him. Certain point, like after I'd finished my phd because I thought his, he was back back in 2012 when I graduated. He was making these discoveries about late night eating and how it like, how it makes you, um, you know, more so you basically more insulin resistant, how it's like screwing up brain function to all these things that I didn't even talk about and start.

Speaker 2:          02:44:01       I got really interested in it because I know a lot of people that eat late at night and people that are having trouble losing weight and all that, they're eating late at night, so. Wow, that's amazing. I'm going to listen to his podcast with you and, or your podcasts with. Yeah, check that out. That's a, that sounds awesome. That'd be cool. So the saturated fat sugars, what you wanted to narrow that down? I did, because you actually sent me an article about that, which I found was really fascinating there. Although saturated fat is important, it's how would you describe it as a precursor to hormones? It's, it's not just a precursor to hormones, so saturated fat, saturated fat, increases ldl cholesterol, ldl lipoproteins, proteins which carry cholesterol and fatty acids. We always call it cholesterol. It's a type of it. It's a transporter of cholesterol, but it also transports fatty acids and other things.

Speaker 2:          02:44:55       But the thing is is, you know, the Ldl is very, very important because, um, every time you make a new cell in your body, which is happening constantly, you're always making new immune cells are making new kidney cells. You're making new liver cells. I mean, it's happening all the time. Anytime you make a new cell, you need ldl there to transport cholesterol and fatty acids because cell membrane, the cell itself, the membrane is made of it. It has fatty acids and cholesterol and phospholipids and other things. But so you need that cholesterol. When you damage the cell, you know, and you're repairing that damage. Cholesterol needs to be there. So, I mean, you really, really need cholesterol. LDL cholesterol is very important for that, for that reason, and without it you're kind of screwed, right? I mean you can't like repair damaged as well. You're not going to make as many new cells. So all these people that are avoiding saturated fat and cholesterol in their diet, they're doing the literal doing literally doing their cell regeneration the disservice. Well, I don't want to make that broad state because I don't know what else they're either, maybe they're getting other types of fatty acids that also helped. But yes, people that are like on stands for example, which is a very broad way of inhibiting like cholesterol synthesis

Speaker 3:          02:46:11       brought like fullstop. Um, that's why a lot of those people on statens I'm one of the major, major side effects is muscle atrophy and muscle wasting. You know, because your muscles, one of those cells, you're constantly repairing damage and making the muscle. And it's a big, big problem. Huge problem with Staton staton users. It also. So a colleague of mine, Ron Kraus, he's at a children's hospital in Oakland. He has been studying status and their effect on Mitochondria and he was telling me that it's like toxic to mitochondria and he's trying to figure out why is. It's like, maybe that's partly why it's. I'm also causing muscle wasting.

Speaker 4:          02:46:51       So if people don't consume saturated fats or they lower their radically lower the saturated fat in their diet, how does their body produced new cell membranes?

Speaker 3:          02:47:03       Well, I mean, you still, you're, you're making cholesterol in your body and you're making it from there. Getting fatty acids. They're getting it from plants. I mean plant sterols, they're getting them from, from other sources, you know, but I think the problem with the, with the saturated fat was, it's not so much that because people still get it to some degree. I mean it's like, but it's not an optimal. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I can't attack. I'd have to see like the person. I think it varies depending on what else they're eating. But you know, the Pr, I think the problem was that saturated fat was demonized.

Speaker 4:          02:47:38       Well, it was demonized in a very corrupt way, which is the, the, the recent New York Times article that was released, which was a mindblower, which detailed how the sugar industry had bribed scientists to release data blaming saturated fat for heart disease and obesity and all these issues when it was in fact sugar that was causing all that. So they were literally rigging the system and paying scientists and it was a horrible article because that propaganda and these lies that they spread, I believe it was in the fifties, here it is, how the sugar industry shifted the blame to fat and it's if you get a chance and you want to feel sick at what can be done with money, watch or read that because it's just, it's awful. It is really awful. And um, it was an internal sugar industry document that was discovered by a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco. And it was published, he said Monday when this was out, I believe it was a couple of months ago, but it was amazing. It suggested that five decades of research into the role of nutrition in heart disease, including many of today's dietary recommendations may have been largely shaped by the sugar industry and propaganda and money. They spent money to literally bribe scientists to release false data.

Speaker 3:          02:48:58       It's horrible, really nasty, but I mean the thing is not that much money either there. Here's

Speaker 4:          02:49:03       a goal. Go back to it. Here. They paid three Harvard scientists equivalent of $50,000 in today's dollars to publish in 1967. Review of research on sugar, fat and heart disease. Studies using the review were handpicked by the Sugar Group and the article which was published in the prestigious New Jersey. New England Journal of medicine minimize the link between sugar and heart health and cast aspirations on the role of saturated fat even though the influence peddling revealed and documents dates back to nearly 50 years. More recent reports show that the food industry has continued to influence nutrition science.

Speaker 3:          02:49:37       This had such a negative like con. There was such negative consequences from this, from from the demonization and saturated fat because people then obviously started eating more refined, like for breakfast in the morning instead of having eggs, you're having like cereal, but the real problem was the trans fats because trans fats can, can have similar, but their hydrogenated hydrogenated fats, which you know, you take like a, a mono saturated fat and hydrated and you can have similar properties, properties as a saturated fat like butter, how it's solid and then melts at a higher temperature. But these trans fats, I mean I remember my mom had a big tub of margarine. I mean we used to put margin on our mashed potatoes and everybody thought it was healthy and it was so. I mean, it's not just unhealthy. I mean it was literally, that's what's called, it causes heart disease because the trans fats, like I said, you take these fats up into your new cells, right?

Speaker 3:          02:50:35       Because that's part of what, you know, fatty acids and cholesterol, that's part of what you're doing with them in your body. The transplants get taken up and the whole structure of it's screwed up. So when this happens in the endothelial cells lining your blood vessels, it makes them real stiff, real stiff and like, I mean it's just like screws it up. So trans fats are like, we have known about the, like the fact that trans fats are playing a causal role in heart disease for decades and the FDA finally in 2015, 2015, okay. Finally banned them from the u s and gave all the companies that are still putting them in their process foods and a lot of fast foods companies use crisco because it's cheaper three years to get it off the market. So we have until 2018 Jesus Christ, three years to get rid of poison.

Speaker 3:          02:51:19       And that's after already like decades of knowing. It's like, you know that this is like, it's like so bad, so, so bad for you. Anyways, that's a, that's a whole. That's one of the major repercussions. And then obviously then people became scared of saturated fat. And the thing, the thing with the sugar, and this is kind of what you were initially hinting at, is that a lot of there, there have been a lot of studies that have linked, you know, that weren't corrupt by the shirt, like these were the early study, but there have been studies that have linked saturated fat and take to heart disease and, and a lot of those studies were also because people were eating, in addition to saturated fat, they didn't correct for like refined sugar intake, which is really what the problem is. And that has now shown in multiple studies.

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       So you know, and this came down to actually being able to have new technology available that was able to then, you know, ldl is not, there's not just one ldl cholesterol in the body comes in all sizes and types. The type that we're talking about, the good type is the large, buoyant type. And that's what saturated fat increases. There's also, it gets processed into smaller parts that are small, dense ldl and that's what gets basically, it can't get recycled back to the liver. So it stays around the bloodstream and undergoes inflammatory transformations and sticks in the blood vessels. It causes all this problem, right? That's what refined sugar increases. And that's been shown in clinical studies. So like healthy young men that were given 20 ounces of soda a day for three weeks. It totally healthy young young men increase this, increased their ldl, small dense ldl particles like massively increased small dense ldl particles and also increase their inflammatory markers.

Speaker 3:          02:53:00       C reactive protein, but like almost 100 percent, which is like crazy. So we're talking about like, you know, the refined sugar is what can make saturated fat dangerous is when you combine the two because the ldl gets processed into the small dense and it's refined sugar that does that. So, so small dense ldl versus ldl. Yeah. And so the thing is is that even now it's not standard of care at a lag. Measure all the particles sizes. It's like we've known about this for at least a decade now. Like so Ron Kraus, he is, um, he's the guy who actually pioneered this assay and figured out how to measure them. The small, dense ldl. It's called the ion mobility as say a, it's in a quest labs does it, but you can also ask your physician, you can ask your physician to measure the particle size. Um, but the thing is, is that because it's not something that's standard of care, when you go in to measure ldl cholesterol and it's above a certain number, physicians are like freaking out and they're like, you should get on Stanton's.

Speaker 3:          02:53:57       But the reality is that you need to look at the small dense ldl. That's what's actually puts you at risk for heart disease and that's just not standard of care that you have to like specifically ask for it, you know, and so crazy that there's such a vast difference in the consequences for your health. But yet it's not tested even though the knowledge is there. Well, that's what I was saying with the Trans Fat. I mean the knowledge was there. Like I was talking to my, like 88 year old mentor Bruce Ames and he was like, I remember back in the eighties though, we stayed away from that and never gave margin. And my children, I'm like, well you're a scientist. Like my mom wasn't, you know, like he's known about this for like when I was like, like five, you know, he's known for 30 fucking years and now 2015 is when, you know, there's always a lag between research and the application of it. But I mean, I don't know how much of A. I don't know what it takes to, you know, maybe these regulatory committees May. There's probably a lot more than I know that goes into like figuring out like how you make these regulations. It's only financially motivated. That's what's disgusting about it. They're given these companies three years to get poison out of food. That is what really upsets me. I'm like, okay,

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       you finally finally have banded in the US, but you're given three years, like three years for people to profit off of poisoning for killing. People don't realize you should have a fucking cancer recommendation or a warning the same way you have on cigarettes. And it's not even like you can go. Like people go to the supermarket and you'll say no trans fats on their food. And all that, but when they go to fast food or they go to some restaurant where they're using Chris crisco's, they're not even going to know they're getting it. And I'm telling you this was awesome. Oh man, totally. God Damn on the budget. This was great. You blow my mind every time. This is amazing. There's a lot to study folks, so go over this podcast 30 or 40 times and I know I'm going to go over it. A few found my fitness on twitter. What your, your podcast found my fitness. I have a podcast. It's called found my fitness and actually I just released a podcast today with Dr Roland Griffiths, who is the notorious Psychedelic psilocybin researcher. I met with him when I was at Johns Hopkins outside of my realm, but you should listen to it. It's interesting. I will definitely do that and let's do it again soon. It's been too long. So much fun. Thank you so much. Thanks for. I appreciate it. All right folks. We'll see you. Bye.

Speaker 6:          02:56:21       The.

Speaker 2:          02:56:37       Yeah? Yes.
