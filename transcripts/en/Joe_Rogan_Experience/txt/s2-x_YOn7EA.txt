Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Oh, it was fucking brutal, but I was like, you know, I've done a bunch of podcasts that dom sitting there. He's like, what are you talking about? The whole podcast did. What do you want to talk about? We talked about sports for about 50 minutes comedy for five and that was it. It sounds like Dot Moreira and we're live with Jenny Johnson. High Five. What's up? What up? First of all, that's fantastic. Twitter name. Thank you. How'd you get that? Because Jenny Johnson was taken and I had to get clever. I was like, well I like high five. Let's go with that. But I've had people that have told me I was at you or you're making fun of people dates be. I don't think so. No, he asked me that. I had been asked that a lot and I was like, what do you mean? Well Ahi and the number five, you know the Roman Numerals v.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       So like I was going to be Jenny HIV. What the fuck? I'm saying do a lot of stupid shit, but that's hilarious. So someone more than one. I've been asked by several people like online or in person. No, no, no. I just like high fives. Like that was it. Now that you brought that up is probably going to be like some blog posts written about it and a conspiracy will get formed. Yeah, that. I like that. That's what you're trying to do. Right? That's the type of things that like, like really wacky people that believe in the Illuminati would start to sort of say the d five is actually the jumps in each. I'm like, my birthday's in May to number five, you know, it was just like, okay. So I was just kind of doing it through that a little bit too. Like, Hey, high five other number, you know, like I actually had no, it had nothing to do with anything.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       The number, the name Jenny Johnson was just taken. You sound a little defensive. I started to believe that maybe I've got the full blown, full blown disease. Is Hiv even the disease anymore? I mean it is, but nobody dies. But now I feel like now it's like whooping cough or something. Kids. Oh my God. Do you remember the moment when there's a few moments where I remember like when Sam Kinison died, you know, like things along those lines when you found out that someone was done. But when I heard that Magic Johnson had HIV, I was in the car with my girlfriend and we were in Boston. We were driving. We were both like, Holy Shit. It was like beginning of like the walking dead when people started to get sick. Like, oh no, fuck, it's on. It is magic. Johnson of all people Jensen's famous. I'd say the one that killed me too is a easy eating.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       Yeah. He died of aids and that was also like, it's just, you didn't see that coming. Like I guess I, I think I just assumed maybe it was all in New York. It was gay guys that are getting, you know, like as a, as a kid, you know, I, that's, I didn't know any better all in New York. That's funny. Why New York? I don't know why, because every, every scene, every, you know, like everything you saw in the news that it was always coming from New York because they were too lazy to get out in the rest of the world. That's what you would see. I'm like, well, how does this happen? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       it's a weird one. That was a weird one. Like easy. He was the weirdest one because like, what was he doing? Was He doing intervenous drugs? Was He having unprotected sex? Sex? No, it was just. But it was with a lot of girls that had, that had used it as Tommy Lee not have aids. Then how does it like, there's a lot of of titus or something, but doesn't he have that from heroin? Allegedly. They're all doing it in the bud. Whoa. How dare you didn't mean it. Isn't that the Charlie Sheen thing? Charlie Sheen was blowing some guy that was smoking crack and there's a video it was allegedly did, but I didn't know if it was real. Like when Charlie, she even goes on. Matt Lauer it all and it wasn't like Magic Johnson spelled where it was like, and I'm going to be an activist for this. He's like, it's over. Not panties whores. Any anymore money there.

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       There was nothing that was good or productive. Know with people that I'm an activist. No, just not paying these horses anymore. I've paid $10,000,000 and I'm done because he's paid $10,000,000. Blackmailed by a bunch of different women who had gotten to his house and I guess open his medicine cabinet and saw his HIV medication. Took a picture with their cell phone and said, pay up or I'm sending this out to the press if I was Charlie Sheen, so I took that shit to get high. If you smoke crack and take HIV medication, you go to another dimension. So good walking. Amazing for a little riddle in there to cut off.

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       I've got to imagine that stuff has got to be somewhat psychoactive. I don't know. I have this drink and do drugs with like other sure. Street drugs with it. Yeah, because like if you do certain drugs with other drugs that dances them, right? Candy flipping and all that jazz. What is Candy Flip Candy flip is this wacky kids when they do the acid with molly, like they do Mtma and acid together. Wow. It's supposed to be amazing. Supposed to survive. If I didn't have kids, I'd fucking jump in there. I will give it a shot. I feel like this might be worth dying for. I can't leave behind him. How'd your dad died serving his country. It was flipping. My Dad was candy. Flip it with some 20 year olds.

Speaker 2:          00:05:22       Get to say that I guess. Right? I'm sure they brag about it. Yeah, that's, that's my old man. That poor fuck. He's a fascinating guy though because he is fascinating. He was on one of the worst sitcoms ever that was successful. Like that fucking two and a half men was so bad. It's. I tried to watch one episode. I couldn't. I couldn't do it. I mean, I couldn't even make it through like so the next break for, you know, it's not for me, but it's for somebody obviously giantly successful and to even have him fired and to bring another lead on and it still works,

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       but it didn't get canceled it. I know, but I thought it worked for a while. How long do they do it with a coach? A couple of years. It did work for a bit. Even noticed the people that are watching that, they're all on Ahcccs. They're just fucking sitting in front of the TV, whacked out of their head. They're just waiting for the laugh track to kick in so they can laugh it. The commercial going to be on. They get excited for commercials. So commercial coming on soon and I'm sure the commercials were really appropriate for that shout down. Well those guys, that guy who Charlie Sheen feuded with him. Yeah, he's awesome at making those kinds of sitcoms. He knows that he's done it a bunch successful as shit to that guy. If I was on a sitcom with him, I would ask no questions.

Speaker 3:          00:06:43       He knows exactly what the fuck he's doing. You had read the script and go, this is. This is the funniest thing she'd ever read. Ready to go. Just tell me what the words are right before I say this, what are rehearsed this? But it's perfect. No, it's amazing. It's totally amazing. He knows how to hit that frequency. There's like a, like a dog whistle. Is it just, is it people in Oxy, do you think? Or do you just think it's like kind of middle America just get home from work and it's, it's, um, it's on CBS. There's definitely that. There's definitely the Middle America thing. It's not offensive and it's a, it's an easy watch, you know, like I've always said like, how the fuck does anybody watch keeping up with the Kardashians until I watched it and the fucking thing is so bad, but it's compelling the air out loud and just shit talk, like allow things.

Speaker 3:          00:07:34       I punched my dog. No, don't do that. I feel like a lot of people, I feel like a lot of people hate watch it. Yeah, they definitely for sure. I think there's plenty of people, sadly enough that like it. There's a lot of people that like, I think a lot of people actually watch it just because they hate it. Well, it's, it's one of those things is they've become, there's so much focus on them that they've become a thing. So when, when the camera's on people. I have this theory about television fame and just any, any form of media and my theory is that it hijacks these ancient reward systems that are in place for us to follow successful people. So like say if we were going to tribe together and all the three of us were in a tribe together and Jamie just fucking slayed all the intruders and figured out how to get the food and new world, the water was, we'd be like, we've got a foul Jamie.

Speaker 3:          00:08:26       Jamie's a bad motherfucker. We got to follow him. And so Jamie would talk in front of the Campfire and we would listen. That's sort of like a natural thing. You follow successful behavior. Well, when a camera's on someone for whatever reason, we, we think that that person is successful. So they talk, they talk and we see all the money they have, we see the cars they drive and all the nails and the purses and all the jazz and we'd go, oh, they have all the good stuff. We have to follow them. And it sort hijacks this thing that's weird. I don't think we're designed for media. I think that television and film and music and all that stuff, it hijacks this part of, of, of being a human being that is a. it's just unaccustomed to these sounds and these images, like you go to a movie and you see a, you know Brad Pitt or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:09:16       His head is fucking 15 feet tall. Every time he talks the music plays is the words are perfect because they're all labored by a group of writers. They've worked at it for weeks to get the right sequence of words and the right order and the right way to say it. And they practiced it hijacks you and then you run into them in person. You're like, oh shit, you are dumb as shit. Holy Hell. There was an interview that he did once. I forget who the fuck it was, um, who he was doing an interview with those, like, who's this fucking moron that, uh, whoever the guy is like Larry King's interviewing, like, who the fuck is this? It was on TV and then I turned around the corner and I saw that it was Brad Pitt. I was like, Holy Shit. Brad Pitt. Dude. Was it bad? You're boring as fuck. Yeah. It was boring. It is. Is it worse that they're boring or is it worse when they have been famous for so long that they have the answers to everything? I think he's probably so tired from fucking Angelina Jolie all the time that he just has no energy for thinking. And all those kids was kids running around screaming and before her it was Jennifer Aniston. Probably reading scripts are there all the time till 3:00 in the morning just in brush brushing each other's hair and.

Speaker 3:          00:10:35       But he doesn't have to be, you know, it's almost like he's like a lottery winner. He's got great features. He was a movie star from the time he was very young. No need to develop a personality whatsoever. If you're pretty, it works for you. I've looked at it again, you know, here's my thing on Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt who out of all the, like the really famous movie star type people has ever done more good. Like that is true. They do so much good. There's so charitable. They're always involved in all these, uh, charitable functions and go to the shitty parts of the world to adopt like 50 kids a week. Constantly adopting kids. This gang of kids have a gang of kids. That's entirely true. I don't think you have all those kids at attention. They don't. They have a tribe. They don't. I bet they each have a nanny.

Speaker 3:          00:11:20       The nanny think they each have a spotter and each kid has their own. Whether the dudes boring or not, but I don't know, maybe those fucking interviews are boring to, you know, it's like, it's far. Jesus wasn't the. I don't even know if it was Larry King. I, I can't remember who the hell it was he was talking to. But I was, I remember I was in the other room and I was like, who is this boring dude? It's getting interviewed. And then I turned the corner. I was like, that's Brad Pitt proud. You're boring, boring. You should be fucking psyched. He should be like a brat pack.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       I think it's really funny when you go to like, um, if I have like people come into town, they always want to go to a taping of a show, you know? And so I've used whatever connection I have. Okay, we'll go to this. I love watching the painful look on the interviewer's face during commercials, you know, like whatever show it is like fuck that fucking guy, you know, where they're just reaching and it's really hard. Like I can tell, you know. Then there's those guests. It just get it. They're very likable and they're good at it and a chatty and work the crowd and everything. Like I saw, I think it was like Nick Cannon was on Ellen I have, I don't give two shits about. But the guy did it right. Like he was good with that audience. Right. You know, he said the little funny jokes and he was real and then I saw some other guy go on and he's like, well, this is one of my first interviews I've given on empire. I was like, I don't watch empire, and the sad clown in the audience. He had prepped whatever it was he was going to say, but everything he wanted to say was so fucking lame. You just had to watch. Her face was just like [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:13:02       just struggling, going through the whole thing. It was like, God, God, that's the worst part about those shows and the best part about doing a podcast. Like I only have people on that I want to have on. So it's all up to me. I decide like, hey, maybe Jenny Johnson, hi, five. Be Awesome to have on a podcast. Boom. And then those people, they have to get like, people that are on radio shows or radio shows. Don't ever interview radio show people. I think I made that up other than Howard Stern. What radio guy ever gets interviewed? Uh, no, no, I was going to say like rush, but they have to. They have to interview people. They don't really give a fuck about. It's like CNN or whoever it is that they work for. Sets it up. One of my favorite ones was when Chelsea handler was on with a fuckhead. What's his name? The English dude.

Speaker 3:          00:13:49       That doesn't work there anymore. Oh yeah. Oh God. Ugh. Fucking tool. He's so gross, but I don't know. Maybe he's a nice guy. Maybe we stop saying that he's gross on on a show. I'm not a fan of the shitty says to you. I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well we go back from a tabloid environment living work for like the sun or one of those companies that got caught, but tapping into voicemails of people that had died and the family got upset because they thought that the person was still alive because they were checking their voicemail was actually the whatever tabloid. Yeah. Whatever shit person sold their soul to the devil and Chelsea handler did it and Chelsea handler gives zero fucks. She doesn't have any fucks left, does not care. She doesn't know. Fox does not care and she tortured him. She tortured him because she was like, no wonder why your show's getting canceled, like you're fucking terrible at this.

Speaker 3:          00:14:39       And she like, she was calling them out like that in between takes. He didn't talk to her. He would just start checking his phone, looking at twitter and really seeing what people thought about them there. Oh, it's. She brutalized him and she's one of many. She's one of our, he just goes into these debates on armed, like he went into this debate with Ben Shapiro, who's this right wing Guy, a very smart guy, and like if you're going to debate this guy, you got to have your fucking facts in order. And he just didn't. He went into the gun debate with him and he just destroyed and he called him out on his outrage peddling that he was immediately going to like, you know, in the debate that he was going to immediately bring up sandy hook and bring up all these different people and that the children that died and that he was going to immediately use that as like this cry for outrage.

Speaker 3:          00:15:29       And he called him on it before he could ever do it. And you could see piers Morgan was like, he's taken all his weapons away. Hit the end of eight mile. It's brutal if you ever seen it. I've never seen him do it. Oh, who appears? Piers Morgan and Ben Shapiro fencing. That one's pretty good. Yeah, totally. Okay, let's watch it. Pull up a pierce. Morgan gets destroyed by Ben Shapiro. I kind of love that though. I like when people are just. I can't stand all that stupid so. Well those shows that whole type of show. It's so. It's, it's, it only exists because you have a network, right? So you have a network which is this gigantic thing that has had programs on forever and they have all these advertisers that they do business with and they have these commercials. They're gonna sell. So essentially the show is only, it's only an advertiser for advertisers.

Speaker 3:          00:16:17       That's what it is. Like all these interviews and all the different programs they have, all they're doing is trying to get you to lock in long enough so they could slip an add in. So every 15 minutes I'll slip ads in and that's what they sell. What they really sell is ads. So didn't give a fuck what you want. It's not personality driven, it's not. It's not about establishing something that's interesting and fascinating. And Hey, we're doing good work here. No, it's just about selling ads like that. I was a news producer for like almost 12 years where you really were a and Austin, San Antonio and Houston. Oh Wow. Texas knows top producing first and then I just wanted to make more money so I got the news, but it was still like, you know, you have to know all that crap. You have to get your stories. And here was a watch. This is pierce Morgan gets owned by but in a video. So I found like a five minute version. So

Speaker 4:          00:17:13       in American TV series American. So why am I of only on this issue? Because what you do, and I've seen it, I've seen it repeatedly. What you tend to do is you tend to demonize people who differ from you politically standing on the grades that the children will see it. Not saying they don't seem to care enough about the decades. If they cared more about the decades, they would agree with you on policy. I think we can have a rational political conversation about balancing rights and risks and rewards of all of these different policies, but I don't think that what we need to do is humanize people on the other side is as being unfeeling about that, about what happened in January. You accused me of standing up the grades. I've seen you do it. Liquors, like I say, update. Let me. You can keep saying that, but you've done it repeatedly.

Speaker 4:          00:18:04       Well what you do and you keep sending those folks if they disagree with you politically, then somehow this is a violation of what happened in Sandy Hook and you get I, I really like to hear your policy prescriptions for what we should do about guns because you respect the second amendment and you know I brought this here for you so that you can read it. Constitution. I really like for you to explain to me what you would do about guns that would have prevented what happened in Sandy Hook. If you want to do what you did in the UK, right, which is banned, virtually all gone. That is at least a fair argument and we can have a discussion about whether that's something that we ought to do very clear what I want to do, which is exactly what Kelly wants to do it. Rather than talk about that rather than address your comments to me about the staffing of the grades of children starting to trust them too long because he agrees with everything I've been saying because he thinks the same way.

Speaker 1:          00:18:56       What does that do to talk to someone else? I think it was Gabby giffords. Was it? Yeah. So he's just now picking a different shooting total. Now we got him. He agrees. What was it like doing news work is fun. If it bleeds, it leads. Is that true? Like what are the conversations that nightcrawler show with nightcrawler movie? Is that what somebody get burned back at babies? We'd have a lead tonight per and a bag of whatever's new. Whatever's you know, when Houston, you know, sometimes it'd be an apartment fire southwest Houston, like it's just whatever's happening. You know, it's, it's local news and so, and in Austin I did more sports which was more fun and then when I made the transition to news I was in San Antonio and in Houston and it's as a producer, you know, you write the newscast, you're writing with the anchor site, they're talking heads and then you go in the booth, you all right, three, two and you know, it was fun for awhile and then I think it actually got under my skin a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       I was always doing like comedy and stand up and everything on the side. And then when I realized I could do that full time instead of news I got out while you were doing the news, you were still doing stand up around town. Was this during the last stop days? A. Well, Houston and in Austin it was like 2000 to 2004, maybe city. I opened at cap city one time, but I did like the ones on sixth street, like Velveeta room was just learning. I was just starting out so you know, it wasn't that great. I wasn't gonna be a headliner at cap city at that point. What is it like working with newscasters? Because they are the most bizarre television personality. Like there's really nobody that is more arrogant

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       than your local newscaster, you know, it's not because it's that person that's been there forever and everyone around town knows him, but the moment they cross out of town, nobody knows who they are. So they just, they're very big, big egos and sometimes they'll try to, you know, flex nuts and god isn't ready. I just sit down old man, you know, just put the thing on. Like I would never take shit from them, but a lot of people would get their feelings hurt sometimes. Bizarre folks, because they're in the entertainment. They are, they're essentially. Yeah. What their entertainment is like. They have a voice that's soothing for the news, right? There's a way of delivering the news. It's like the way someone would sing a song where like it, the melodies sort of like interacts with your ears and a very pleasant way. And just to go from story to story, you know, and you just try to make it more interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       So the directors like let's do a two shot, right? It's going to one favorite is when they do banter in between to fucking stupid. They really are from weather to from anchored a whether from news to sports and it's like. So it's just like we were saying about that game yesterday. I write down exactly like we would just be in this town. Purpose says the worst thing ever. Well certainly interesting in local news. Hey, taking the kids to ballpark this week and we'll go ahead and let you know what we're looking at. Right, right, right there. Brought me to like make it stop. Did you ever see that one where the girl she was talking about, she was trying to talk about music and she used the term Jigaboo. She was like Jigaboo music. Don't think I've seen them all to. She didn't know. Was she a reporter?

Speaker 2:          00:22:32       Yes. Yes. She was a reporter and she was talking about something. She goes, Oh, you know, it's like that Jacob Music. It's like Jigaboo music. And the person she was talking to was a fucking black guy and he was like, oh, it was a black guy, right? Wasn't it? Maybe a baby girl, baby girl? No, no, no. First of all, you look deep in her eyes. You see the back of her skull and look at the dude. Want to take a moment to address a comment that I made yesterday? Oh, this is her apology. Apology. We'll just take a moment. Have you ever noticed like your local

Speaker 5:          00:23:14       wonderful

Speaker 1:          00:23:25       look at his face? Look at his face. And he's like, I mean, your family knows, right Jacob? Uh, yeah. That's fine. What's called, which is for. He's like, she's got a beautiful voice. Yes, yes. Fucking going. You in trouble. I'm going to smile through this and keep my. Wait. So that commercial break, when I explained to you what you've just done to our viewers gighub you jigaboo or we would have I think one of the funnier things, it shouldn't be funny, but it was funny is so our reporters out there live shots so whatever's going on and they were in a live truck so they have to feed the video and we'll cut the video and say what's the end out cue of that voicemail or yeah, I mean the votes out or whatever. So if there was something that was like, there was a drive by shooting now that's not funny, but witnesses to things like that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:24       When the camera gets on them, there was a lady holding her baby that at coke and the bottle, she weren't a boys to men tee shirt and she was like well you know this here darious and he, he's so cute and he, we want him to do modeling. Did you say coke? Like Coca Cola. Coca Cola, baby. Yeah. You know like that kind of classic. When she gave the baby Coca Cola, the baby was drinking like a soft drink out of a bottle at the fucking shit. No, I'm not. This is like, you know, the projects. It's like, do you know how much sugar is in a fucking coke? Like think about the size of a baby's body. Well, the baby just had bullets whizzing by, it said to, through the drive by. So maybe. Yeah. I mean it was just. And then the mom just promoting the baby.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       Not talking about the people that were just gunned down, just like trying to get him a modeling job because she thought dairies, we keep, you know, and he should be on it. We're going, oh yeah, no that's not gonna. Make it cut that show. There was a guy, a lot of guys like to try out there rapping skills while you interview them for like crimes. Like did you see the drive by, there was this, this store was broken into and the, you know, the clerk was shot, you know, oh, here's what this witness here. What's your name, sir? Then because the camera guy, let's say, say your name, spell it so that we can cut it. We, I mean these don't even make the error, but it would just be like so, so, uh, okay. Now tell us what you saw. Well, one, two, three, I saw them wrapping.

Speaker 1:          00:25:53       You're like, this is your big break. This is what you chose to like, this is never going to make the air dude. But I guess they think maybe will they don't know. They don't know. There's layers and layers in our society of people that are in the worst possible scenario and the best possible scenario. That's one of the worst scenarios we have available in the United States of America as the ghetto. A yeah, you would see it and it was just so like, oh my God, I cannot believe y'all shot this. And half the time I'm like, I know the camera was fucking with me. You know, like sending that in. Like, I think you're gonna like this, you know, the sound byte. We just got to get jaded at all. Seeing like really fucked up shit over. And I did. And that started to bother me, that it didn't, like I could just see it, write it, put it in, and I could remove myself from that situation, but then there would just be those times like something really bad

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       happened and it's like it was personal or it was like we actually had our sky helicopter crashed and the two people were killed like our coworkers. And so that was something that was like, it was Kinda the first, like the beginning of the end for me where I couldn't stop, you know, I couldn't do it. I used to do like, everything felt very personal. Oh Wow. Yeah. So that was kind of a, that sucked. But I was, you know, I'm glad I did it for as long as I did and I did well. But do you talk about it on stage at all? Um, sometimes. But I guess sometimes it just depends on the context or whatever's going on. But sometimes we'll talk about it. It seems like it'd be right or maybe write something about it because it seems like it would be so ripe for material and just what it's like.

Speaker 2:          00:27:30       That movie. It is night stocker, right? Xeloda is nightcrawler. Nightcrawler. I haven't even seen that one yet, but I heard it's great. It's really creepy. Jake Gyllenhaal will. Will. He looks wrong. Shirt and shit. He's all scrawny and creepy looking now. He's so good. He's such a good creeper. Like it's perfect. It's like maybe it's too good. Well I just think he's got it off. He can become. Not that guy in the but he can become people. Yeah. Know. And he just did such a good job of capturing the sort of sociopathic personality of someone who would ambulance chaser and I. Well I think that happens a lot. I mean people that want to get the story, break the story first and you know, to try to break a story first, especially if it's something horrible you, you do feel like when you're done it's like, you know, just trying to call people and trying to dig up shit and you're just wasn't for me.

Speaker 2:          00:28:21       After awhile I could imagine I have a friend who's a cop and he's told me that they'll get to a scene and someone who had been shot and people, you know. No, no one even bats an eye. They'll, they'll start eating donuts, like literally eating donuts like right next to the body, like no one to care for them. It's work. It's just a crime scene and start cracking jokes. Sure. Yeah. And, and that, you know, I don't want to say like I went there but I mean sometimes I, you know, like we would see a video, the full video before it's been edited. Then we would edit out the dead per. And it is weird when you're just doing that and thinking absolutely nothing of it. Just cut that. Is there any pressure to show like more like the, there's like libel laws that you have to follow in news like in, you have to know those going into it, that what you can and can't say what you can and can't show, you know, you can't say like you were saying like allegedly or you know, there's certain things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:29:18       You can't say it's a fact when it's just what it has to come from a legit news source. So the Associated Press or CNN, you know, like you, you have to be able to cite the source that you got the information from. You can't just say, my aunt called and said, you know, this just happened and that's not a credible. One of my favorite ones was this a news report on an arson. These people, their house got lit on fire and this girl is interviewed and she's like, I don't want to name no names, but uh, it was my cousin because he's been trying to get with means. And I think he's the one that lit the house on the what are, had been trying to have sex with me. Have you seen that Jamie? Yeah, pull that one up. See if. Well, because we broke up and he's mad about it because it's so hilarious. This lady is. It's just like. Yeah, that's why she's like, I don't want to name no names. Here we go.

Speaker 6:          00:30:15       Dan and amy. I am Elizabeth Berg and I'm just going to step out of the way now so you can take a look at this scene. What is happening right here behind me? You can see that firefighters are still working to make sure that this fire is out. Smoke is still in the hearing and firefighters are still over here trying to make sure that everything gets under control. Barrage here. That is when a fire is. Heather, don't me. You woke up around 3:45 and you saw this. What happened?

Speaker 7:          00:30:43       I woke up and said beating on the doors. My neighbors. I opened up the door. My neighbors were like, get out, get out. You know, so well opened up the door. I see. Just blazing from the garage and I woke him up, my husband

Speaker 2:          00:30:59       out as fast.

Speaker 7:          00:31:02       Move the vehicles out of the way and I had him go back in the house to get our two dogs that we had in there.

Speaker 6:          00:31:08       When you got outside and you saw what was happening, you saw what was going on, what were your thoughts face in the background? My Gosh. Oh my gosh.

Speaker 7:          00:31:16       You know, I didn't ever think it was going to happen to us.

Speaker 6:          00:31:19       Do you know how this buyer story up?

Speaker 7:          00:31:22       Yes, I do. It was cousin my cousin and I don't want to mention no names.

Speaker 6:          00:31:30       And you said you think your cousin started this? Do you know how or why?

Speaker 7:          00:31:34       He's mad because he couldn't. He can't get with me. I'm married to my husband and

Speaker 6:          00:31:39       my second cousin. Marie short? Yeah, he put it. He already put him in the hospital once last month.

Speaker 2:          00:31:46       I figured he's going to do something else. Should be on cost. Not on the news for the look at the guy. How is he not dying? Laughing? Well, he's not very good at his job either. It's kind of clunky. It's a tough gig. It is a tough Gig, but that's not a normal reaction to someone saying that he normally acts was a what? Your cousin hold up. I mean he's got to stand there with his tie and professionally and not smile or laugh or go. What the fuck? Oh, aware. First of all. Where's that fucking town? Where does deliverance burger. But it's always those Weirdo towns. I have a friend, she works out here for the local Fox station. Lawrence. Ivana is her name and she had, I love it because she's made the soup tmz for all of her call called John Boehner. John Boehner. And I was like, everything.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       And she's like, Boehner. It does look like Boehner. Like if I saw that in a teleprompter, I would have to.

Speaker 3:          00:32:45       Don't say. Did you see or what happened with him? He got busted because he, he's renting an apartment that is owned by the indoor tanning lobby.

Speaker 1:          00:32:54       Stop it. No, no, no. It isn't orange phase. I retweet it. That I retweet it today.

Speaker 3:          00:33:02       Uh, it's called Gen briny. Briny. How do you say her name? She tweeted it at me. Please tell me I retweeted it because it's so ridiculous. It's not a new story from 2013, but yeah. Really? Yeah. Well, everybody's always wondered why this guy's Tan all the time and he's always said, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       Yeah, I mean he looks bright orange and you're watching the state of the union like tanning bed lobbyist,

Speaker 3:          00:33:30       indoor tanning. Look at it as fancy as fuck. I'm orange. As long denied. That is perpetual skin colors. Result of some of those tailoring. He just spends a lot of time outdoors. The Ohio Republican is known to say, but despite his repeated denials, using tanning beds, Boehner has ties to the industry. You just said Bonar. It's Bonar b o e h n e R. It's Bonar. It's Bonar. You do you get baner out of that? That's not been. No, that's not painters. Bar that's boner. Not only has he accepted campaign contributions from a group called the indoor tanning association, but when actually lives in a DC apartment owned by a lobbyist for the American suntanning association. First of all, how gross is politics? This fucking guy can live in apartment owned by a lobbyist

Speaker 1:          00:34:21       for someone who contributes to tanning association of a. that's a real. The American suntanning association. That's a real group. I did not know that. That was. How can that even be a group

Speaker 3:          00:34:31       and how was the only paint? 1,600 bucks a month for rent in DC. DC's fucking expensive. That guys

Speaker 1:          00:34:41       crooked crooked to. There's something else going on everywhere. So politicians. I hate all politics. I'm a political atheist. Are you one of them? Good for you. Let me to end up lying. I mean, you're banking on somebody.

Speaker 3:          00:34:56       Wait a minute. Bernie Sanders. You think he's lying? Bernie,

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       I think Brittany needs to run for like a homeowners association in Boca Raton or something like that. Bernie, a nice cold. The sac, the sac ping pong championships on the one percent of the CULDESAC. Bernie Sanders is an interesting guy though. He's at least getting young people excited because they're hoping and praying that someone is different and no one is different but him. He's the one guy that's coming along, let's saying trump's different in, in a way, in a bad way, but he is. I actually will say I was backed into a corner and somebody was like, well, say something nice. I'm glad he's not lying. I

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       believe he believes every single thing that he's saying. I don't think he has a team of campaign managers telling them what to say. I'm pretty sure that he just gets up there and just start spewing crazy. But he believes that lets it rip. It's worth a few billion. He's like, fuck it, let's roll the shit. Yeah, I mean, I, there's something that's kind of hilarious about that part, but other than that, they're all full of shit. There's a recent bill or a vote that's going to take place in the UK to try to ban him from entering the UK for hate speech. This is like a serious consideration and it's going on right now. He's um, for uh, the stuff that he said about Muslims, he just said, I mean, at some point you're like, I think that everybody was kind of on board at first. Like all the old crazies, somebody saying what we're all thinking that it's kind of people and then he just hasn't stopped talking and I think now they're like, whoa, yeah, yeah, come on buddy, you crossed we get your back.

Speaker 2:          00:36:35       But now kind of spewing some crazy. Like I, I actually think that like all these old people that like him believe that Muslim is a terrorist organization group. Like I don't think that they get that. That's, that's like they think Al Jazeera, that's actually a TV channel. It's not a like the Taliban that Brown Peoples Jihad, Jihad, Jihad and whatever. Yeah, well people are terrified of people from other cultures, but when you've got all their cultures that are involved and things like, you know when Isis. But when people have to understand is people, isis is killing more Muslims in there. Are Anybody, most of the people that they're killing or Muslims? Yeah. Like they know they're just bad. There's this battle that they're, they're like they're criminals. I mean, it's, I don't know why this annoys me, but when I'm watching the news or reading the news, which I prefer to read it because it annoys me, not watch it, but people will say, well, we know we're waiting to find out if this was a terrorist attack, like the San Bernandino thing before they release those names.

Speaker 2:          00:37:41       Once they released their names, therefore it became a terrorist attack. Don't you think that like the Sandy Hook Guy, that was kind of. He was terrorizing people, but I like that they have to be a brown in order to be a terrorist. Well, that's our new. Isn't that weird though? Our new enemies, the war on terror and terror has to be like. It's like the Germans. We have to go up to the Germans and the Japanese or the terrorists, the terrorists. It's country. But what does tear me, and it doesn't mean brown people do it bad. We renamed the country, you know Japan, they call themselves the poem. I don't know if you know what we're going to wait because I remember Pearl Harbor. There's all these people that believe there are in other countries, but as Americans we get to dictate what their actual alarms are, so we're just going to decide to call it all terror. So these are terrorists. They live in terror. That's the part of the world called care. You're not allowed to come over here. We'll put you in camps like we did the japs.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       That's some dark shit, man. So horrible. I was talking to my mom who lives in Houston, conservative Republican and all those fun things. So I love poking her at the stick. It's really funny. And when she said, oh, it was terrorists in San Bernardino, and I was like, well, I mean anybody that did that is a terrorist. Doesn't matter. When we find out what their name was, Jenny, the terrorists are like the really bad ones was like, I begged him. I don't know. I think the Sandy Hook, I was pretty bad. I got to say, I don't think he was awesome.

Speaker 3:          00:39:06       The fucking Colorado movie theater guy. That's a terrorist. No white guy with the orange hair of the real bad ones though. He's. He can print announces. Yeah, if you can pronounce his name, just not as bad as the guys that saw he lumped. That'd be that bad, bad stuff. Bad News. Well, it, it bugs me when people won't criticize Islamic terrorists or Islamic people though, because they are worried about being Islamophobic. Like Islamophobia is a weird one. That's a weird one though.

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       Anything that's a phobic like, well, it's the um, what's the word I'm looking for you? Like if you're on a watch list or whatever, you know, you're, I'm drawing a big fucking blank. What is it called me? Like, prejudging somebody here. I'll just. Yeah, there was some prescreening. Yeah, whatever. You're making an assumption here. I've stereotype, you know, like whatever. And that's okay. Sometimes I don't think it's a bad, like I heard this couple one time I was on a flight and this family and they're completely dressed Muslim, you know, the face covered in magazines, old people just like, you know, the Gilligan's island, old people, you know, just, and they're like hitting each other like this guy. I'm like, no, I don't care about those people. I care about the guys that are going to come on board with slacks that they've just bought at Mervyn's or something and will button down. It's still get creases like no luggage, you know, um, if that's who's going to freak me out on a plane as the ones that just are trying to fit in fuse, coming out of their shoe, not the ones that are like fully standing out with all of it. Like, no, sorry. I know I, I, I will prejudge. Yeah. Because I'm not going to just go, well, I don't want to offend anybody so let me get on this plane at these fucking creepy people.

Speaker 3:          00:40:53       Cool. But what I was getting at is it, it's just weird that people will call you out on being Islamophobic, but at the same people will openly mock Christians. Sure. Like, they'll, they can openly mock scientologists they should. But, but if you, for whatever reason, I guess, well I guess the, the legit angle would be obviously because we're at war. We were at war with two different countries and we're still in Afghanistan, right? A lot of troops still in Iraq and more now than before. Right. And we just send some new ones over there, but. And those people that are involved in the conflict over there are Islamic or are Brown. Right. So I guess it, it lends the idea

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       that like, well you shouldn't be Islamophobic, you shouldn't be critical or prejudice against Islamic people, but it's just, it's an ideology like lucky first of all, excuse me, any, any religion is stupid, but they're all dumb. I was just watching bill burrs stand up and I was laughing so damn hard about and talking about scientology and he goes, yeah, it's funny. I mean you're, God's name is Ron, you know, get a driver's license and a social security card. He's like, but I found out about it when I was an adult. When you're a kid, you don't question it, you know, grew up Catholic, right? He's like, yeah, you, why would you? Sure. Yeah. Three days later came back. Yeah, here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Like you just believe it and then as you get older to challenge it or to question it, you're an asshole. You know, like you just can't, don't, don't challenge the Bible, don't it's, you know, you can't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:42:26       I think there's a higher power. I don't think it's that story, but maybe a version of it. Maybe not. I don't know. Who knows what it is, but whatever it is, it's not what l Ron Hubbard wrote. It's not the one guy who wrote the most books of anybody who ever wrote books, ever scientology. He wrote five books, fiction. He wrote more fiction. Any person's ever lived. He really did. He did have one person that's ever lived on the planet. He wrote the most books. That's incredible that they think that that city, right? Fuck load. Exactly a fuck load. Fuck load. That's exact number. Yeah. That's a lot of books. That's a good question. James is gonna. Pull that up. We're gonna find out, but he didn't know. He wrote the hold the distinction. She's the most prolific fiction author ever in the history of the human race.

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       That's how stupid scientology is. The guy who made up the most shit ever also told the truth about the fucking frozen ice cubes filled with Metta volcanoes and volcanic and that's why you get anxious. You know, it's a. it's all so stupid. Swimming across the board that's made up stuff. It's people making things up, but you live and you die and no one knows what happens when you die. We'll all find out one day. Hopefully. Maybe. Maybe we won't. Maybe not. Maybe it will become something that doesn't think here it is. Most published works by any author, number one, a whole Ron Hubbard. Yeah. One thousand and 84 books. Jesus Christ. Did he even fucking do a second draft on he of them? There's no way, right? This books are so bad to. Have you ever publish them? I don't know. I don't think so. I think he published them.

Speaker 2:          00:44:02       I mean he had been. He published a lot of them in those. A scifi magazines. That was like a, a big part of what he was doing originally. Wiki would get books published in those, you know, they were like Reader's digest. Who would have these sipho last one was published in 2006. Then he died like the eighties. Yeah, they don't. Well, I don't think it was the eighties. I think it was like the nineties. What is it? 80 six was. Well, I'm sure they just found a bunch of shit that he had laying around. Stay the guy who was probably nuts. He'll just sat down and just never see like interviews or. Do you ever watch those documentaries? I'm fascinated by it. I love. Well, I'll watch any documentary. That's all I ever watch. But those are particularly fascinating because he looks crazy. Oh, he's crazy as fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:44:46       Lawrence Lawrence Wright wrote a fantastic book called going clear and that's what seems to make that or read that one. That was good. You read it to him? Yeah. It's amazing. Like when you hear about how nutty he was, like he was beyond crazy, but it's one of those are usually people that end up getting like a leader of something. They're always, they're smart but crazy. You know? It's like a psychotic brilliance that you can manage to get that many people on board. I mean, they all dress like sea captains and she's like, yeah, I'm like you, you have a lot of metals dude, and you have been highly decorated officer in what? Like, well how about when Tom Cruz won that gold medal for being awesome? Holy Shit. You fucking sit there and they were so like tense. Then you know both of those guys that are about five foot one, five foot two. Holy Shit that made me laugh. LRH lrh. Yeah. They salute to l Ron Hubbard, the LRH. This photo of them, they'd salute the photo like it's fucking like it's the flag. Just thinking like one of your friends. It's like real silly and Goofy, like one of your craziest friends. And then imagine his face or her face up there and everyone just to. Just to Andy Dick, everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:46:06       There's a room full of people that give money to. That's. It could be that. It's not that much different. No, no, it's not. No, it's not. I mean he is working with the size of the fucking metal mean. That shit makes flavor. Flave look, he saluted him. He looks over and solutes and everybody claps. First of all, look how beautiful that set is that David Miscavige, whatever that guy's. She's just crisis genius. That metal that he's wearing his whole neck. Some crazy, some crazy cytology stuff. That's the day with a youtube video. It's fucking wonderful. They're wonderful. And there's a great one that a doc on you can watch on youtube. It's like scientology in me. I think it was, um, it was, it was from the BBC, but it's really good. It's this guy just track him down and getting them. It's a good one. It's all clean water in clearwater, Florida. Yeah. He was in, but there was a summit was in London, like their headquarters in London, so it was pretty different when I'm thinking. I did see that one. The clearwater one. Yeah. Well that's where the org people, my family used to live there. My Mom and my dad, they lived in clearwater. My sister still lives in Tampa. There's still still down there. Is that where you're from? No, no. They moved there to escape the Boston winters.

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       Now they're just trapped and trapped in a sea of stupid. A lot of Nice people down there, but you know what? I was just there in Tampa this past weekend. You know what it is? It's all people from the northeast that escaped. That's all my whole show was like New Yorkers, Boston people, Jersey people were tired. People just get out of their fucking get a job down there. Fuck winter. They just say fuck winter, and they'd go to Florida. I would do the same thing, but I grew up in south Texas, so like an admin. It's 50 degrees out here and I'm like, hey, it's freezing. I'm such A. I couldn't deal with. It will sound like Texas. Like I dunno. I love Houston spots. It's got is it's got character. If you're downtown and there's a lot to do. There's, there's a, there's a life down there, you know that.

Speaker 2:          00:48:13       But then there are certain places that. Yeah, no, it's not that fun. Well, I remember when I was in Boston, there was essentially, there was four big comedy scenes that we'd heard about. There was the Boston scene, there was the New York scene, there was a, the La scene is kind of a San Francisco seem a little bit, but there was a Houston scene and the Houston scene was because of Kennison and Hicks Hicks. That's where he was such a fan of his. But like now they just have the Improv. Like I, I did a show at the Improv over Christmas break and it's awesome. It's fucking huge too. It's a great venue, but it's kind of in a weird part of town and. Yeah. And it's just, you mean black? No, it's out. It's not really, it's not a black part of town. They only seem to book a lot of black comedians.

Speaker 2:          00:49:00       Oh, but no, it's just off of the interstate. It's an exit, you know it. It's just a weird part of town. Like there's just nothing really around it. You're just kind of like hauling ass down. I 10 and then you take an exit and there's the Improv. So sad because that place, the laptop in river oaks, that's where I know that was the best. I did my first CD there. Oh really? And Ninety nine was the shit, it was the best club. It was set up. Perfect. Now it was like a restaurant and I think they're trying to get it where they can at least open part of it up. It's still there for comedy. That's a different uh, it's, you know, it's a restaurant, a restaurant, bar, restaurant and that, but as the stage still there and everything. No it's not, but they're trying to, you know, like all the comedians are going, hey, give us a parking the.

Speaker 2:          00:49:45       Because there are a lot of good comedians and he just, you know, and he wanted to be able to like do your job and then try to do this on the side. Like that's what I always enjoyed about it, but you know, I'd have to go to the Improv or try to get some stage time or sometimes I would open up for my friends that were musicians. I would just do a set at their, you know, so at least I could get. I could get stage time, you know, it's tough though. Oh yeah. So non ideal. But I think, you know, it helped that I already had a job so I didn't care as much. Right. You know, like if I was depending on that as my livelihood, maybe I would have been more nervous. But it was like, yeah, fine, I'm going to have to work tomorrow is one of the more frustrating things for a young comedian.

Speaker 2:          00:50:25       There's, they're starting out is to grow up a town that doesn't have a scene play now if you're in Cleveland or something like that. I don't know if Cleveland as a scene, but it's fucking hard. And these clubs like the Improv are amazing to work out if you are professional. But yeah, like I've done, you know, a couple of shows at the Improv here, but it's only because maybe somebody asked and they had to pull strings because I'm not a name for a marquee, you know, and you. And for the Improv you have to be like trying to get on at the store or the laugh factory. And on like a Saturday night, they're not going to just go, hey yeah, go do seven minutes. Well, they've sort of boxed themselves into this whole though because you're the only will they have these rooms that are like 500 seats so they can't have open mic nights because they can't keep the room open because they can't eat all the staff and everything.

Speaker 2:          00:51:17       It'll cost them too much money. Yeah. And as soon as you don't have open mic nights then you're not developing new talent. As soon as you're not developing new talent then you have to get all your ax in from out of town and it just, it kills the whole art form. Like you have to have a place to start, you know, there's no one place where everybody starts. You can't say, oh well they have open mic nights in La, don't worry about it. We'll start out in la. No, I mean when I came out here and I started doing just. I mean I'm, I'm doing more writing, but I still like doing, I like trying to do stand up, you know, two, three nights a week or something. But it's hard to even get that sometimes. Like the laugh factory. They're good to me over there.

Speaker 2:          00:51:51       And they'll give me a, you know, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, you know, one of those nights, a flappers comedy in Burbank. That's a great plot. Great Club. I've done. Have you done the ha ha in North Hollywood? I have done that. New One is fucking awesome. It is awesome. It's amazing. It's perfect. So I, you know, it's like, but I have to find everything myself. I don't rely on like my agent to do that. Like it's just, you know, I just want to get it sometime. I still do that. I just find everything myself to day. You find that because I like sitting there talking to him. I'm like well you're not getting like I get everything going to me shit. So I'll just keep doing what I'm doing. And especially like little clubs in town. I mean, I mean all my bookings, like if I do theaters and stuff like that, my agents do all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:52:32       But like if I do local spots around town, I have to fight. Like Joey deals will call me up. Listen to dog. You got to do the fucking hot Hollywood. He'll be taking bong, his voice, talking to you and the other girl. Right. And like we tell each other, like comics will tell each other like this is placing on Sundays in Santa Monica that Neal Brennan has is supposed to be awesome. Yeah, I keep seeing that on his, uh, he's promoting it west side comedy theater. I think it's called. I haven't been there yet, but I hear nothing but great things. So that's what you hear, you know, you hear about cool spots. Like I did the um, the laugh factory in Long Beach than that. Um, I heard that. It's a great spot. It's a great spot. It's a great spot. But the new ones also everything is because of like just me, like either hounding people or just a friend helping me out.

Speaker 2:          00:53:20       Like, Hey, do you want to open for me when I'm in Long Beach or well this is an amazing place. If you're in La, this is amazing place to work because you really never have to leave. You can work in just drive, you know, you can drive to Irvine, drived Ontario, you drive to break if you want to get crazy, you go to San Diego, you know, there's so many places to work around here. It's actually really pretty cool considering like I moved here from Houston, you know, it's just, there's just no scene. It just wasn't there. It didn't exist so used to. I'm telling you, that used to be one of the best places. When I first got there, I first got to Houston in like 96 or 97, somewhere around there, maybe 90, maybe 98 either way. Um, when I first got there I was like, Holy Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:54:07       They had an open mic night that would start at like eight and go till 2:00 in the morning. Yeah. And the open mic night was in the bar area where they had a small stage and then they had the main stage with a main room was, which was fucking perfect. It was the perfect setup and they had all these really creative young local comedians and they didn't have any tolerance for hacks. I was like, this is just like Boston, but like hot, like hot weather, but nobody can put their finger on why it stopped because the club went under. It's that easy to throw water on a fire if they don't have anywhere to perform and if there's no one seen like, like somebody than try to take it. Like I just felt like there would be somebody that would make more of an effort to try to get it right, but who do it like? I don't know. I always thought that there would be somebody that would try to bring it back up again. But. Well they tried. But you need like real resources. You need a club, you need a liquor license, you need a, you know, you need the whole thing. I mean they're idiots. Can open bars. How many bar owners do you know? I don't know any idiots that owned bars. Do you know it? Idiots it on bars really a lot. Really Talk to those idiots. Tell him to put a stage up.

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       I don't know. It's fucking. It's not like anything else. Like if you, if you want to. I guess being a musician was probably just as difficult, like how does that mean? I mean, I guess you can kind of make your own mix tape and shit alone. You don't need. You don't need an audience to practice. That's the difference between comedy and other art forms. You need an audience to practice to know that. Well, that's one thing that I always enjoyed about twitter. You can kind of tell if something a joke works or doesn't work on twitter by people liking it. Oh yeah, definitely. Now it's like, okay, that works, so let me try it verbally. You have a big following on twitter just from being funny. You know, Bert Chrysler and I were talking about you one day, the podcast. Why I say that message? It was all my friends were like sending me the link to it and like, oh sweet.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       Thanks. Well that's a cool thing about twitter is it's like there's a girl. She calls herself slash lien. God, I love her. She's hilarious. She's up in Toronto. It's the same thing. She developed this giant following just from being funny and I think that like people like her myself, I'm like Rob Delaney, we all kind of jumped in at the exact same time and I think, I don't think that's possible now for somebody. I think there's too many people that people always say that, but it's like, I don't want to start a podcast now. Everybody's got a podcast, but what, how, how about those guys? We fucked girls. Those girls that have that podcast called guys we fucked. I'd never heard of him. He never heard of it. It's like top 10 always, and then it's only been around for like a year. They just have a really good podcast, developed as big as following and then shot up through the rankings, like quit.

Speaker 2:          00:56:41       I don't think that podcasts I don't like. I'm, I think that yeah, a lot of people have them, but I still would encourage people to try. But with twitter, the only thing is, you know, it's just, it was so new and different and everyone's like, who is that per, you know it, it was so new and exciting and now there's all this other crap either there's too many things, periscope, snapchat, all the other, all these other social media things and at the time it was just like facebook and twitter and I was at twitter doesn't do it, doesn't grow like it used to. The amount of people that you get, like people don't like you. Some people used to get like massive amounts of new followers like really quickly. But it's hard to do that now. I think also like if you look at someone and you look to see like, like how many people do you follow?

Speaker 2:          00:57:26       I follow a lot of people and you read every single shit. I'm retarded. I got something wrong with me. I scan twitter constantly for interesting stories and if someone posts, I'll look through their feed. They post two, three, four interesting stories in a row and boom, I follow him. I'm like, you never know. But how do you find them? Just through somebody retreating number or something. Most of it is because they tweet things to me. That's a lot. Okay. So someone will tweet something really cool to me and uh, I retweet it. Like what I've started doing, I started doing a long time ago is when people send me cool stuff, I retweet it because it gives people an incentive to send you more cool stuff and they go, hey, retweeted me. It's fine. It's cool. And like when I find their page, like if someone retweets something or if I retweet something someone sent me and I find their page and they have a bunch of cool shit on there, I'll start following them.

Speaker 2:          00:58:17       And I think that just that way you ensure that you have like sort of a network of people that are distributing interesting information, sending it your way, but he's a link. Is it links to things? Sometimes it's links to things that are. Sometimes it's just a funny not apply to you. Oh yeah. Sometimes it's funny reply sometimes. It's just a funny post now how many unfunny replies you get from people trying to make you laugh. Yeah. You get those that's going to happen. It's just cluttered and it's just, Oh god, sometimes it's so pull. Yours is so humor based, you know, you're, you're almost insulting me. And I'm like, what the fuck? And they'll go, it's getting, you know, like as a joke, a joke. I'm like, no, no, no, I can't. Well you got to think there's a lot of people that are just trying anything to get a reaction from you.

Speaker 2:          00:59:04       They're standing out there hyping until we get a signal back. I mean, but it's, it's such an interesting concept that people like, like I did a panel at south by southwest last year, two years ago, something like that. And it was just it. Yeah. And it was just about like getting a career out of it, you know, like how else would anybody have noticed me outside of Houston? Well that's how I noticed you. I don't remember when I started noticing you, but I've been following you for. How long have you been on twitter? Since like 2009. I the thing I've been following you for at least two years, at least two years. And I don't know how long totally, but I remember a guy tweeted one of your things like to me, I think someone tweeted something funny that you said and I think I retweeted it and then I started following you.

Speaker 2:          00:59:52       That's how I do it. But it's really. Yeah, it's kind of, it's word of mouth, word of word, but, but you could still do that, but I do think that's fast. I, that's what I love about twitter. I think it's really fascinating that. How else would anybody I've ever heard of me if it wasn't for that particular form of social media. I just think there's too much now. There's too many people. There's too many extra things that I don't think people are going to get noticed that way that I lucked out and got out of this. Well, there was that affect like the early days of my space. Do you remember the mindspace effect? Like Tila, Tequila and cook and all these people got super famous, like really quick. Because once you know, first of all you followed Tom because everybody had a fall. Tom, from my space, what the fuck is Tom Up to these days? Just hope he's okay. He's in Belize right now with gold underwear on and fucking stacks of champagne bottles next to him and big fucking bed.

Speaker 2:          01:00:48       Just bawling. I mean, how much money did you make from that? Fucking stupid. It made a shit ton of fucking facebook guy. Yeah, I mean, yeah, that guy's made insane amounts of. Wow, that's impressive. That's bizarre. That's bizarre money. He looks bewildered all the time too. Like whenever he just woke up from a nap to me always looks like he's worried that someone's gonna kidnap. I'm constantly. You got that kind of money, like don't you know that he's probably had those threats. Threats for sure. When you're going to be billions of dollars. Billions and now he's got a new baby. I believe it's him. His wife just had a baby. He's Christ, but he takes pictures of everything is why it was baby. Look at me, look at them. Maybe it's like putting it out there, like he's getting the jump. Like, uh, what's his face? Ben Shapiro was.

Speaker 2:          01:01:32       I'll put it out there first before. Well maybe he's just surrounded by fucking Spec ops guys just locked and loaded, ready to party. It's a strange thing like facebook was cool at first and then all of a sudden when I started getting friend requests from my mom's friends, you know, like then all of a sudden it was like something else. Well, too many people get real weird online and just started just digging into your stuff and stalking you and look at those. Jenny Golan, what she eats here every Tuesday. It seems like if I go there on Tuesday, maybe I'll find one. I really enjoy your tweets. You think he gets on my underwear. It's like, I don't know. The people that think they know you based on. I think instagram was more that way. Like I have twitter and instagram and that's it. I don't have the other things, but

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       I would have like I'm gonna take an instagram picture of you right now that people will know that this happened while we're actually doing the podcast, talking about instagram, so looking at me like Bam. Second. Put that up. If people go, Hey, but I've had people like I went to, like I took a trip, a road trip with friends to big Sur and I went to big Sur. I love big Sur shit up there so one of my friends took a picture of me, you know, you get no cell reception and so we're like on this side of the road, I'm holding my phone. I was like eating an apple and she took a picture but it was so beautiful behind me and I put that on instagram like, oh, I'm in big Sur. And then I had these people that are like, you have to stay at Fenton.

Speaker 1:          01:03:00       That's where you have to stay and you need to go eat. And I'm like, do you think I drove from La to big Sur without a plan of where I'm going to stay and what I'm going to do? Like they're telling me what I need to do. Well, they're just trying to help. No, it's in a different way. It's like, yeah, you need to do this. You don't know if it's like a deep seated like as a kid being told that or something that it's just so obnoxious to me. Yeah. It's like I know I have a plan. Don't worry. I'm good. I'm good. You're a bit of a rebel. I see what's now. I think I'm probably an asshole. A bit of an asshole is probably more accurate. I always assume it's. We have very different reactions to the same thing. I always assume that it's people that are in town that are trying to help me out and steer me towards a good story.

Speaker 1:          01:03:40       You look at. It's like they live in Vermont or something. They're just like, they've been there once and telling me what to do, but don't you think that just trying to steer you in the right direction. You're like, fuck you. Don't tell me what to do. Yeah. No, I think they're horrible people. I think they're terrorist sympathizers at the sympathizers, yet they're all about isis. See, I always think they're just trying to help out. I think it's cool. I enjoy it when people do that. I even asked for suggestions. I'll ask for. That's different now. I'll ask for suggestions. It's just, Hey, I'm in big Sur and then it's like you need to go eat here, you need to stay here, you know, you have to do this, you need. And I'm like, if you, if you made it, worded it in a way that was like, I don't know where you're staying, but I could tell you like I stayed here at one time and it was fantastic.

Speaker 1:          01:04:21       It was more of like the telling me what to do. You think that people say that when something's awesome like, dude, you need to check this out. I find sometimes people do it to let me know they've been places. Does that ever happen? You know what I mean? Like it's like kind of um, Brag. Almost like a humble brag. It is like that or a Oh, that jacket. Yeah. That. And then tell me the name of the jacket, like the brand or whatever. Like I have that jacket too. Do you react? Is it like men telling you to go somewhere and do things? Do you, do you need to blow your nose? Yeah, I need to blow my nose, my allergies. My claritin has not kicked in yet. Um, what do you have allergies to? It's usually when it rains, whatever it kicks up. It's like pollen, ragweed, like all that shit oil, plenty of oil. But it's not, it's not that men actually. It's typically women that do it. Brilliant. Yeah. Oh No. Yeah. Men Don't really actually bothered me that much. I mean that if somebody will write something sexual or whatever, I'm like, ah, thanks.

Speaker 1:          01:05:26       It doesn't, I don't get offended by it. It just thinks like gives a shit I, but I've see you. It is funny when you click on that, you can click on their page and you'll see. It's like the pictures, you know, the guy and his wife and three little kids and he's like, I want to smell your vagina. You're like, I'm so glad you're married. And a father. I just imagined my dad doing that. Growing up. He would have had instagram. God, he wouldn't have. No, no, not yours. Not My dad. He would probably, he would have been more of the, you know, like when you're a kid, you're like, you walk in your Dad's watching tv and it's like there's just tits on the screen here. I'm going to get on there, I don't know, skinemax or whatever these flipping through and then I walk in and surprise him and he, oh no, I was just trying to figure out those goddamn remote, like, fuck, no, I'm not doing that.

Speaker 1:          01:06:17       That's what he grew up in a different era. If he grew up today, the, your era definitely formed you in a way. I see. My parents were like, my dad and I were like, well, 40 years younger than my parents. My Dad's no longer with us, but my. Yeah, they were just older people that had kids later in life. Well, there was still banging it out late in life. That's good. Yeah. They were like married for I think like 15 years before that. My sister. Wow. Yeah. But the downside would be like my sister and I'd go, hey, we want to go to California, go to Disneyland. Disney, you know, and I know we've been there a million times, just say all. No, that's makes me sad as a dad with my kids, we always did shit, but we were. We grew up on the water so we had like, oh yeah, we always ended with beach boat, sailboat.

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       We had all the fun stuff. It's not like we were in the Gulf that water oil spills up that motherfucker now probably a lot more. I don't think there were so many when I was a kid. They weren't digging, I'm sure as much. I don't think so. I went to Santa Barbara recently after the big oil spill in the Gulf. Whenever I see those fucking things out in the water, I say, well that's a ticking time bomb. Right? So that's going to fuck up eventually. And then this beautiful beach, it's going to have oil all over it. Well the odds of it fucking upper actually. I mean you think about how many rigs are in the water and how many spills there have actually been. It's, you know, it's, it's not the odds of all of those things. Having a a, a spill is pretty. It's fairly low, fairly low and it's, but it's always like human error. It's just they're not hiring and it's always bp and I always, I actually think it's always bp. They don't hire the right people. It's not always other companies with the last big BP oil spill to cut corners, like the fact that they cut corners and the way they constructed it because they were behind budget, but exactly the amount of they have

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       versus the amount of accidents that occur and the devastation that occurs because of the accidents. That's one way of looking at it, but the other way of looking at it is when those accidents do occur, the fucking catastrophic damage is so devastating that each one of those things is a ticking time bomb. And how long have they been doing it? Well, they've only been doing those offshore oil drills for like 30 or 40 years I think. I don't think it's been more than that. I think it's been. I think it's just over 40. I think so. So to me, I look at it like nuclear power. There's only been a couple of nuclear accidents, but those accidents are a fucking crazy like Fukushima. Everybody's sort of forgotten about it, but every. I still check on the news or on Fukushima because the mainstream news is completely stopped paying attention to it, but if you pay attention to it, if you go and search out, it's off cluster fuck over there.

Speaker 2:          01:09:07       It's really bad and it's not getting any better. Like anytime soon. No, I grew up in the town I grew up and actually had a nuclear power plant. Well, yeah, and then riggs everywhere. It was just. I'm surprised I don't have like a fucking arm guard out of my head. I have a buddy who was a bone cancer because he grew up next to a golf course and really fucking golfing and gives you a bunk answer. No, the pesticides they would use on the golf course. Keep the weeds down. Sure. Sank into the wells and so they had well water. Everybody on his fucking block. Our cancer, like literally everybody got cancer crazy. Well my dad, I mean he. He died from cancer, but he also worked at a chemical plant for 37 years, so now you can't tell me that, that didn't like play into him getting diagnosed with cancer.

Speaker 2:          01:09:56       Just smelling chemicals all day long, like there's just no way. And I know all the people that he's worked with and how many people have ended up, you know, getting some fucked up kind of cancer. Oh Man. Oh terrible. Do you feel like um, there's a, there's a weird thing going on with instagram and social media and stuff like that, that there's this new sort of intimacy that's very difficult to navigate. That's what I was saying that people like sort of contact. Do you like they know you or they, they reach out to you and give you suggestions. Like they know you there. There's an intimacy that people have with people that like them or follow them that you didn't have to really handle 20, 30 years ago. People have access to. Yes. You have access to them if you're so inclined and you know, like I'll get people because now like with Instagram, you can direct message on instagram and twitter, you know, read those though.

Speaker 2:          01:10:50       Um, you know, I'll see. Sometimes I'll click and I could see what it is and if it's just something I'm like, man, just I've already seen it or I can't sit there and accept everything because then everybody would keep. Yes. You know, sending things. Um, how many instagram followers to like 57,000. That's a lot of fucking people. If they all hit you at once. Yes. So I try to help addicts together on a daily one or two. Not as much as I should. That's the right thing. I, I'm kinda disappointed at my level or yeah. Or if somebody else send me like the same day, I'm like, I've seen that. That's not shame on you when they get a google image. Dick. Yeah. They're like Google image, somebody else's Dick. And I'm like, don't do that. Guess what? After this podcast, they're common. Thank you Vinnie Johnson.

Speaker 2:          01:11:38       Night five following up right now. You're the camera's clicking away. You written on unzipping. I don't want to filter on them either. No. Filters do prefer semi rigid placid. I just find it entertaining that anybody would do it. I actually, I can't ever say that it's different for guys. Like if everyone's like sending you boobs, like you're going to be happy with boobs. Yeah, but like, I don't know any girls, they're like stoked. When a guy sends him a dick pic. It's got to be some. I mean I get, trust me, my phone is filled as some of the negative shit you've ever seen. Like the gift, Jif pictures, videos. I have a healthy sense of humor, but I've never gotten a picture of a Dick and been like, wow, that I want to meet the guy attached to that. Like I've never felt that way, but you're not a whoa.

Speaker 2:          01:12:27       Maybe that's it. Maybe I could try to work on that. But it's weird. Like sometimes I'll, I'll get a photo like from someone I have no idea who they are and it's just their vagina and I'm like, okay. And you're just like, well that's not something you would do. Right. But you knew you wouldn't like find some musician that you really liked and send them a picture. But there's girls who do that. God bless them, you know, they got free time, they're proud. But I think the kind of girl that would send you a photo of her vagina, it was a kind of girl would love a dick pic. Like all right, you know, it's good manners. Bayview give some. I give some. I can't say that I would ever. I mean I would never do that. It's just not. I just the idea of eat me even doing it is hilarious to me.

Speaker 2:          01:13:17       Like okay well let me go like and then like taking a bunch to decide which one you liked the most because you know, it wasn't a one take vagina pick really bad. If you get a vagina pick and it's like that sort of frosty foggy photoshop thing. Filter. It looks like a camera shot or something. Like what the. Is that your, is that a real vagina or is this some anime? Send me that in 1977 filter. Just fucking playboy from the early eighties. You know these, these weird images, like sometimes people will take pictures and you look at the picture you like, that is not even you fucking Dane Cook has done that a couple of times. I've looked at his images. I'm like, what kind of filters? Using buddy, like what's going on here? He cooks. He is a pretty a hilarious instagram page for all the wrong reasons. Should word it properly. Yeah. No, just him

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       without his shirt on or something. And then this long paragraph of how blessed and at some point I'm like, if he is really making a joke, that's amazing, but he's not hashtag blessed. Blessed. I can't even do it. It's a joke. Maybe the entire thing has been following mice. Just randomly type in his name and then just because I'm like, let me see what this is. And then it never. It never doesn't make me laugh. It's funny. Every single time I've seen some good ones. There's a lot of people that are fall looked out there just to just say ridiculous shit. So I follow them for that. Just hoping they're going to say something stupid. I liked the people that will post things like to show you how great their life is. It's the humble brag kind of way. Like I remember this one girl was like trying to show that her son had straight a's on his report card and so like the way that she was holding it was also to show that she was wearing a rolex and shit fucking ring on.

Speaker 1:          01:15:12       But it was like perfectly in the frame that way. But that is amazing that you just did that and I know exactly what you're doing but you think you're outsmarting. Everyone is so proud of my son. Hashtag let my son and then just weird little monkeys in that regard. Peacocking monkeys and in some things it's like I, my mom is like the best at this because if my sister will send like a picture of my nephew on his first day of school, you know, everybody likes to do that first day of school lunchbox backpack and standing in front of the front door and my mom were, will reply back because it'll be like a group email and she'll go, oh, you need to get those fingerprints off the front door. You have fingerprints. Like she looks past the picture to see what's behind that. My sister's front door has glass fingerprints everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:16:06       Like I kind of love that. And if you look at everyone's picture and do that, it's pretty hysterical. Like, what's in the background? I love that. It makes me laugh every time was one of the saddest pictures I ever saw was this girl. She had her ass up in the year and uh, you know, she's like posing style and then the background, the lower left corner is a baby crawling around like a little toddler. It's like, Whoa, that's dark. Like you could see them like in the hallway in the lower left corner of the picture, like Oh God, it's so like, it's disgusting. But then I also like, um, there's certain people that will post the picture where maybe they're on the beach. Okay. And they're looking down at the water and they'll put some like inspirational quotes, you know, something that's like, you know, Jesus be with, well blah blah blah. All I'm going is who the fuck to that took that picture. You had to ask somebody to do that and I guarantee you again, wasn't a first tight eat. Like it was not the first take. Like they had the gun to get up at rock, a little Morgan, my jawline to look sharp and look like really smart.

Speaker 2:          01:17:09       And I that that's actually my favorite thing on instagram. I just like looking at people's pictures when like what are you trying to get across to everybody? Like knowing, knowing the people are going to see it and like I know what you're doing, but some people can do it and it works. Like, like, you know, who I followed, I legitimately enjoy is the rock. The rock gets it too. I think that he gets, he's having fun, having fun. I actually, I liked him but he's inspirational. Like he'll, he'll post like stuff about him getting up at 5:00 in the morning to work out before getting to the set and I don't feel like he's bragging at all. I feel like he's inspiring people. Like he inspires me. Yeah. Actually that kind of stuff we'll get, you know. Okay. Yeah. Get to the gym to, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:17:56       Yeah. Yeah. It is kind of a. But I don't feel that he's full of Shit. I've never felt like he was full of Shit. I even when he was fucking wrestling, he got it. He's wrestling. It's funny, you know, he's playing a character and I have always liked him. I thought he was by all accounts. He's a really great guy. Everybody that I've ever met that met him, worked with him or knew him. So there's a really nice guy just having fun. Have you ever met him before? Yeah, I met her a long time ago. I've met him before he was the rock. He wasn't really that famous. I met him. I was on MTV for one of those spring break things in Mexico, like Cancun or something like that. Speaking. I just said hi to him. It's just a big guy, but he wasn't big.

Speaker 2:          01:18:34       He is now. He's just like, he looked like a regular athlete now he's just as fucking gigantic muscled guy. I can't remember what it was and maybe it was like some after Emmy per after Golden Globe party or whatever, and I saw him and he was. He's a fucking wall. A huge dude. He's like 2:50 all muscle and no fast. Completely. Just totally hooked. Yeah, he's, I like him. He's a nice guy. He seems like a nice guy, but it's frozen chicken. I'd fuck him. How about that? Nope. I said it. I said it. I like it.

Speaker 2:          01:19:10       Yeah. He's one of the few guys that poses in front of a private jet that doesn't bother me. You know, like please God, that's such a heady time. I've been on a private jet. I'm like, oh, I could never do it. Really. I couldn't do it and I would feel so Douchey, Douchey, moved, but velvet suit and again see that someone had to take that photo, but it doesn't bother me. We own the night. Thank you. Golden Globes for a spectacular evening. Wheels up admiring me. Bound ballers. Set. Here I come. Let's shoot ball. So hard. Hashtag velvet blazer. That is a. That is a massive potential for Douche involved in that photo. It was overwhelming. Yet it doesn't come off. Douchey for whatever reason. For 30 3:00 AM. See that cardio before I head to work? Yes. Hashtag Jesus needs a cup of them loaded. Let's roll.

Speaker 2:          01:20:09       I mean it doesn't bother me. He's just one of those guys. He can get away with it. Oh, only 300. 19,000 likes. That's what does he have? Like 50 million followers or something like that? I think I have like 800,000 step video of what happened was instagram account with when you have 8 million followers, when you post something, what happens? Just explodes. This person's phone go crazy. Oh, well you have the fucking turned off or turned on. Oh my God. That would be insane. Have you ever been with somebody that has a lot of followers and then you see a notification pop up that they had a line here that some. Have you ever been around somebody that Doug Benson used to have that he shut it off, but just to have that like, oh my God, look at the phone. Oh my God, that's insane. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          01:20:59       That is insane. Like a soccer accounts to six soccer sports teams kind of thing. Oh my God. That is fucking insane. For the phone. It was like a waterfall. It'd be a great way to test the battery. That battery life is just shrinking top. Just like a Gigantic v eight engine when you stomp on the gas. That is insane. That is amazing. Wow. Rich kids of China just do that. Well, any rich people? Instagram, like rich kids of Dubai, like those. Those things are hilarious. God, that's amazing. Strange and not have the notification thing. I just don't. I don't know. I don't care enough. I guess maybe I should. Well, it's just not smart. Phone was constantly. I mean my phone if it. If you text me, I assume I like you and I want to talk to you and that's what essentially it is reaching out and contacting you.

Speaker 2:          01:21:52       And I have to always, but I don't even keep that. I don't keep a notification even for a text you don't know because of buzz. Your phone isn't buzzard some texts and everything turned off. So because I don't like being rude when I'm in front of like, like when it's, if, if it was an emergency, you know, like don't call you or something. Huh? Well everybody must know then you, you can't text Jenny and hover text you right back. Well I feel like, you know, like if you're at dinner with your friends or something and people lose that friend that just won't put the fucking phone down. That's rude. So I just, I, so if anything I'm doing, I always try to keep my phone. You ever see a Anthony Bourdain's show? Parts unknown? Uh, actually I, I caught part of it the other night. Great fucking show.

Speaker 2:          01:22:36       But anyway, he has these friends that he turned me onto that are in Montreal. They owned this restaurant called Joe beef and it's fucking fantastic community is one of the greatest restaurants in the history of the world and they did this episode with these guys were, they were on the, they went ice fishing and they set up this ice fiscal because they're in Montreal, so it's cold as fuck. So they set up this shack on a lake and inside they had like a full gourmet meal. They set up like the whole deal, like beautiful tablecloths, great food and hold you. And they were talking about like, how do you set up like, what do you, what do you, what do you have rules when you go to dinner? And he was like, rule number one. I shut my phone off because I, I'm, I'm, you know, I want to have a good conversation.

Speaker 2:          01:23:15       You want to be a good dinner guest? I want to be someone who's like, how? How many people do that? How many people shut their phone off? Just shut your fucking phone off. Very few times you go to a restaurant, you see people just staring at our phone with another person's over there staring at their phone, right? Jesus love texting each other. Family of four and the kids had even had head phones on and they're just staring and you're like, your communication skills are going to suck ass when you're older because no one's talking to you. You don't want to talk to them. No one's forcing you to. Well, I have a folder on my phone that's all for my kids. My kids, their little fingerprints open my phone up and they'll like if I, if I leave my phone around, they grab it because they think it's fun to take your fingerprint. Five and seven at the little one. And so they'll go to the folder and if I don't let them, if I don't let him play with the phone like, no, no, no. Come on, let's just have a conversation.

Speaker 2:          01:24:08       You can just pull. Can I just play with your phone? Like, no you can't. Can I play with your phone? No, I just said you can't definitely please put your phone. No, you can't play with the phone. Let's just hang out and talk. That hovers over your head as an option to talking to your parents. It's so attractive that they just can't. What can I play with your phone now? No, you just asked 30 seconds ago. You little fuck. Come on and we'll say that but it. But it is. I mean like I like I saw kids actually will walk in just a group of kids where my, uh, where the gym is that I work at it. We're like Fairfax high school is so I go to this little boxing gym and there's an alleyway where the kids will walk and so like when you're in there you can watch them walking after school and every single one it's just buried in their phone.

Speaker 2:          01:24:49       They don't look up there. Just some lady walked right into me at the airport the other day. I just stood like, like she going to walk right into me. Bam. Just wasn't even looking. Just hoping that people would just get out of her way. I was like, this is hilarious. This lady is just walking forward while texting. All I did was stop. I was like, okay, what's going on here? Like she can't just like go to the side and just how do you walk in text? I ended with an airport. Yeah, and plus there's fucking chairs like everywhere obviously bitch one of the gates. Well how many times you've been on the road and you'd watch someone's swerving and you go, this fucker's texting. I know what you pull up beside them and see the light of their phone illuminating your face is there or when it's like you're at a red light, light turns green and they're still sitting there because there is somebody has to honk and then we'll.

Speaker 2:          01:25:36       This again. I think these things go back to what I was talking about earlier. That media I think is too compelling for our natural response systems or natural instincts and reward systems that are in place for people like this is too much going on there. It's too fun. It's to peek in there, you know, like, but if you ever get like where you were on a long flight and there was no Wifi or whatever and you couldn't wait to play with your phone [inaudible], you know, sometimes five hour flight you. And then when you're finally in a chair and you're comfortable, you're like, check mark when you go to Australia, 16 hours. Anything can happen. We know about that lady that texted that joke about aids. Well that was, we were talking about what you're talking about. You did. It was like one of those people that would do that.

Speaker 2:          01:26:25       She would text funny shit like controversial. Try to be funny, trying to be rude. And she texts this joke about I'm going to Africa, hope I don't get aids. Just kidding. I'm white, lol. Which I read and it was funny. I laugh, she's fucked. I mean she got chicken, did she got shit canned and now she works for one of those, uh, like sorta like draft kings, one of those kinds of companies. There are fees involved in another company. Why are they getting shaken? The owners, they got too greedy with their commercials. Oh really? Now because everybody that did fantasy football and shit like that were, you know, all the cool dudes. If I go to hooters on Saturday morning to draft my team, you know, that kind of thing. And I think that it just got to like in your face like, yeah, we're gambling, we don't give a shit.

Speaker 2:          01:27:11       Here's our ad for it. Like you can't do that, but it should be legal. It should, it should totally be legal. But the reason they're in trouble I think because they get too greedy. Is that why they're in trouble, Jamie, you know about all that stuff. Is that whether in trouble sort of sort of there being, from what I understand there's, they're being a little bit deceptive and what's actually going on from what I've read, one percent of the people that actually play are winning like 99 percent of the money. Smart ones like the rest of the world. And have some algorithms used to be a professional poker players online. Sort of. Oh, so they've figured out how to do it with math. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 2:          01:27:51       I would not be able to do that. Well, I used to have the sponsor called lumosity and lumosity is like their brain games and they're supposed to like increase your Iq. They're kind of interesting. They're supposed to increase. There are games that you play that can actually accelerate learning or help you learn or make your brain work better or something like three's the. There's some number games they're supposed to help you. Chess, chess. It helps your brain while these people got greedy with their claims and now they're fucked and they go. They just had a judgment against him for like millions of dollars have payback. Yeah, because they were saying shit like it could. I guess they had alluded to the idea that it would help stave off early Alzheimer's. Yeah. I had read something about that because there was different games and there was something that was like if you're driving somewhere and there was a thing like drive with oven mitts on or you know.

Speaker 2:          01:28:44       Yeah. Like it was like do something different. Like you always go to the grocery store, you go on this. I'll start. I'll start in the middle. So as people get older, as you get older, you really get set in your ways and so you know, to go this way to this place, go the other way. Oh, how fucked up. But something to just kind of jar your brain to make you. Oh, okay. Now I have to think because usually after a while you're just a robot if you're doing it exactly the same damn thing. And so different grocery store you go to, you know, like that kind of thing. And it was my mom's. I told her about this and she goes, oh, well, okay, well tell me. And I said, well, like when you go to the grocery store, I said, um, go a different route, take you know, take the seventh street and go around doing that.

Speaker 2:          01:29:27       I was like, okay, well when you have the best, but when you go and you always start at produce, this is go start at the bread. I only other said, well that's just stupid. I'm not doing. I was like, well I'll buy and I'll see in the nursing home and always trying to help people. It's weird that people have that thing where like patterns or they actually sort of like limit the possibilities that your brain has to consider. So your brain sort of atrophies almost like, you know, like not lifting weights are not exercising or something along those lines. Like I mean like I have to go exercise. That helps me. Like it makes me. Oh yeah, that helps. That helps a lot. But do you do that before shows? Do you find that like if you have an important show that exercising sort of leaving it?

Speaker 2:          01:30:08       I try to do. For me it's cardio like hard cardio or do like elliptical machine or something like that for like a half an hour before show of, Oh I feel so much better. It's almost, it's almost like I know it doesn't work that way, but it's almost like I got clean out my brain pipes. Like I'm just flushing the system blood. I know it doesn't really work that way. I actually think it does because if you ever had a show where you know you've got somewhere and you're like, okay, I have to, I have to take a nap because I've been going, going to take a nap, you wake up to go to the show, and I'm like, I just, you know, just woken up. I just don't feel as sharp as if I, you know, when I go work out and then I'm just going, I'm like, I'm ready to go.

Speaker 2:          01:30:50       Then. Yeah. I don't know know exactly what the mechanisms are that are going on inside the mind when you're exercising, but there's something that the mind gets exercised too as well as the body because your mind has to move the body, like you think of exercise being a non mental thing because oh, your just immediate. Just feel good and working out, lifting weights, but there's something that's going on while your brain is forcing your body to do these movements. You're, you're exercising willpower, you're exercising like determination and focus. There's always things that are going on that I think accentuate intellectual pursuits. Yeah. If that makes any sense. No, it does, I mean like I, I go to this boxing gym and I don't actually spar with people but it's just one on one me and my trainer, but heel pads on his hands and he, I have to do combinations so I have to think and I know when I start getting really tired and I need to contribute a water, like I'll start forgetting. I can watch myself be fresh and then I'm like, oh Whoa, whoa. Yeah, you told me to waive. Okay, hang on, go back at it again. Let me get a drink of water. But it, I like it because it makes me think while I'm doing something right, I still have to concentrate on. Exactly. You know,

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       whatever it is I'm doing. So there is something to it. I agree with that. Any, any sort of exercise that you have to think about? Things like they say handball is really good for the mind, like yeah, yeah, racketball, handball, things on those lines with that ball's coming. You don't know where it's gone. You have to really anticipate what's happening. Yeah, I would imagine tennis would be the same thing. Like because your, your hand eye coordination involved with fast motion calculations, the spin of the ball, the ball's bouncing here goes a lot of different things you have to sort of trick your mind into getting engaged with. Now. I agree with that. I mean it's, I don't know. I don't know like what Causes Alzheimer's? Like what, what's the cause of it? Is it just. I think it's a genetic issue, is it? Believe so.

Speaker 3:          01:32:49       I believe it's the people who have a genetic propensity for it. I wonder if people that just do like when people get old and they're just in their recliner all fucking day long and that's watching the same shit. Like you're not challenging yourself ever. Yeah. I wonder if that factors in at all. I think it certainly could factor in, but people that have it, it is a disease. Um, people that I know, I have a friend who's girlfriend's dad has it and they have to go visit and it's just, he's just barely there. He's just, he's completely out of it. And he was an interesting podcast, I think it was radio lab where they're talking about they were trying to repopulate the whooping crane. The whipping cream was like in danger of extinction. And one of the things that they had done was they tried to come up with new migration paths for these animals.

Speaker 3:          01:33:41       I think I read something about that. Well, this lady had a bird feeders in her yard and he's whooping cranes, had come to her yard to use the bird feeders and you know, they were setting up these bird feeders and interacting with them and the scientists that had spent so much money and so much time trying to engage these whooping cranes into forming these new migration pass. We're trying to get her to stop doing it, trying to get her to stop feeding the birds because these birds, they will. They don't want them. They want them to be wild. They don't want them to rely on people. And also because these patterns were predictable, people would find them in the people would. Some people were shooting the whooping cranes and should. They had lost a few of them and it's bad fucking ungodly amounts of money trying to repopulate these birds, but her husband had Alzheimer's like real bad and the only thing that would get them excited was birds. So he would be out there with her and he would see the birds. He, we'd all look, look, there he is right there. And she said like for that brief moment, while these birds were there, he would be back and she'd be able to engage them and talk to them, but when the birds were gone, he just drifted away right back. And he was gone. And so she was like, fuck you. I'm hanging out with my husband with the birds. It was weird, you know, that's pretty. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       It's actually kind of incredible. I mean, I remember like when my dad, before he died, this real fun story, but my head, my mom was like, you know, just, they were frustrated with each other. You know, he's just riddled with cancer. She's trying to help. He's pissed and they never fought. They never ever. So it was weird to see them that way. But then if somebody came that he didn't know, he would come back like it was like, you're a new person. It's not the same shit. You know, like as soon as somebody brand new came in, like if it was a nurse or somebody that he didn't know, I would watch him just immediately come back, you know, like I don't know if he was trying to be more hospitable or if it was like what it was, but just you would watch them just like, it could just switch and he would be nice.

Speaker 3:          01:35:43       Well I think novelty, new things, new new experiences, new places, all those things stimulate areas of our brain that we kind of take for granted. Like I like doing things that I suck at. That's one of the things that I really liked doing or like doing things that I'm not good at it. I'm new at them and because because I'm new at, am I getting obsessed with it like you want to be good at, but you're probably competitive to a fault of issues. I'll be sweating at a board game or something. Like just probably why it was real bad when I was young. I'm way better at it now way better because now I understand what it is. Back then I just, I just would be overwhelmed by the demon and I would just, I just needed to win, you know, find a way to win.

Speaker 3:          01:36:29       Right. But I'm just new things, like even things that aren't competitive. Well I guess archery can be competitive, but I just do it like sort of as practice. But I'm obsessed with it. I fucking it just because I suck at it for whatever reason. Like when I'm practicing it's just becomes my entire focus and these new things like that. Like Yoga is another thing. I fucking suck at it, but I was doing it. I can't do it. How come you can't do it? You only tried it once. I'm not flexible. Well that's because you got to stretch what the fuck? Kind of logic. But I suck. That's like saying yeah I tried playing football but I'm not good at it. But try to move around a lot more.

Speaker 1:          01:37:09       Okay. So that's why you go really wasn't I like feeling like I'm doing, I like to go jog, I liked, you know, like that's not enough moving about.

Speaker 3:          01:37:16       Yeah. Well that's part of the whole practice of it is practice being still holding poses. My point, my point is I'm not good at it but. So I'm obsessed with it so when I do it I just, it just becomes like this overwhelming thing for me. But I concentrate on it all the time and I'll do it a couple days a week and for the other days that I'm not doing, I'm thinking about it a lot of time.

Speaker 1:          01:37:38       That's interesting. I think that's why I like, well I kind of stand up those up for me. Oh yeah. Stand up really does that for me because I get, I always get a little nervous before a go, you know, like you and if it works, you know, and if it doesn't you figure out what joke didn't work, why it did, you know, you should scrap it, change it. Should I.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       But I, I, that's one thing I really love about standup is it does like Jeremy, you know, it makes me like, you know, like how you feel when you get off stage and you're like all psyched up and shit. Like I love that feeling of being nervous and you know, onstage and that always is very like rewarding to me. Stand was one of the few things is still challenging in that way. All these years later, 26 plus years later for me. But it's also because I write new stuff. That's the key is practicing new material, having new material, constantly writing. If you don't do that then you get trapped and if you get trapped with an act like we all know those older comics that have been around for 50 fucking years or whatever and they have that act where they're doing like Reagan impressions, smoke issues, Claritin, claritin. No, it hasn't kicked in yet. I took it on. The way here are alerted to anything else? Cats, dogs, cheese, milk, nothing. No. Just flying through the air. I don't even know what it is, Huh? No, I know. It's like a Paul. Every time it rains, that's when it happened. So it's whatever's kicked up like ragweed pollen is. It's seasonal times a year. Yeah. Did you get it in Houston as well? Huh? Just different times a year in Houston is different out here. I've actually had a worse out here, which is weird.

Speaker 2:          01:39:10       That is weird. Yeah. I don't know if it's the climate, like I was in a really humid climate. I don't know if there's just something else maybe that I'm allergic to that I don't know, but I've noticed that because my eyes get a little burn, you know, and I'll get like that, you know, that just real bread. I could feel like everything's draining. That's interesting because a lot of people move to like dry desert climates like Arizona to try to avoid. Believe me, I know, it's weird. I don't know what it is, but it's been worse since I've been in La. So Houston in the summer is one of the most bizarre environments.

Speaker 2:          01:39:44       You're just breathing water. He like, yeah, everything's just. It's wet. Yeah. Yeah. I really feel like you could drain your 100 degrees and 100 percent humidity. It's just the windows outside. You Walk Up, you're wearing sunglasses, they fog up and everything. Your your sunglasses fog up, your. Your clothes instantly stick to you. Like to concerts. We'll start filming a flimsy. It could be at one of those like stiff, you know, t shirts. All of a sudden it's real flimsy. It stuck to you, but it's really good for your skin. Is it? Yeah. Chicks to young looking for a long time out there. Just stay where they're moist. Facially skin was don't mean the other way. Moist. Your skin, your facial skin stays moist. Does that make sense? My line, my bacon things. I use lotion. Yeah. Well that helps too. Yeah, that's a good move. Yeah, I do that, but I think that uh, the environment, like the dry air environment is bad for your skin. It definitely is because I know like when those moments during the summertime out here when it's just fucking that just gnarly heat, that desert heat heat. Oh my God. And it's like, my skin is like drinking the lotion that I've put on it. It's like how my skin already dried out again, you know, like you're just sitting there just. It's pretty, pretty. Not Fun. But I like it out here better.

Speaker 3:          01:41:11       What do you like about here? But more open minded more. Oh No,

Speaker 2:          01:41:14       smart. Do. Oh, you know, I like doing all the standup stuff and writing and it's different because I moved out here. Yeah. Career wise. So I love my career so that makes it, you know. So. And plus the weather's usually always nice out here. I liked the beaches, I like to surf. I like to, you know, it's fun. There's two things I don't like out here. One, the overpopulation. Yeah, it's ridiculously over. Traffic sucks. Traffic sucks that stuff and to. There's. Go ahead. She's, she's

Speaker 3:          01:41:46       tucking away. No, I'm just like throwing all my fucking tissues. It's really impressive that the um, the other thing is there's this disingenuous aspect of the entertainment industry. This is shallow, weird sort of actor. He thing that I think is a product of people having to audition. So you're constantly having to get people to like you, so you put on this sort of fake behavior and then you become a part of whatever click or whatever pattern that you think is like in the vogue in popular, you know, like how many people called Caitlyn Jenner a hero and you know, like it's, you know, you're in, you're in with the right, the right sensibilities to. Right. You know? Yeah. Even on your head, you could be like, with Kony 2012. I mean there was like this fucking Kony 2012 where everybody fucking jumped on board. I'm like, do you even know what the fuck you have a bumper sticker for? Do you know that? I still Hashtag that Kony 2012, but I'll do it on something that makes absolutely no sense. It's just about World Dick joke and I always put Kony 2012.

Speaker 3:          01:42:52       I'm like, I'm not going to let it die, but it's going to keep. I don't want it to stay relevant. Kony 2012. That's one of my favorite all time human folly stories. Because the guy who started that whole movement meltdown he had. Oh, it was amazing. It was so good. That was true. That was true meltdowns. I think he was probably completely insane before he started the pressure of the success of the movement. Like somehow or another this guy got celebrities and all these world famous people were on board because it became the cause detour, you know, it was the thing. It was the flavor of the month. I mean he like how long did it last? So I'm trying to think quite a while. Six months, maybe six. I'm okay. Something like that. But it was amazing. Yeah. Every celebrity was on board wearing their tee shirt. Kony 2012. So many bumper stickers. Oh my God. One day jerking off in front of people running around the street with your pants down screen. Completely naked. Just on a corner.

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       And I like, I Kony 2012. Don't forget, don't forget. Blessed. Blessed. And it ended. It ended like that. Like that. That's all it took. It was like people talked a little bit about the meltdown and then it was like something else happened. We never heard like who knows what that guy's doing right now, but to me that embodies the disingenuous aspect of a lot of the Hollywood like activism type behavior. It's like I don't necessarily think they're really interested in the activism as much as they're interested in people thinking they're interested in the activism. They're trying to put together a package, you know, and that package is how you look, how you dress, how you act, how you behave, and you have to have liberal sensibilities because you want to be fucking cast so you have to, you have to connect with these people that have the casting agents.

Speaker 2:          01:44:37       You can't have, you can't be outrageous in, in any way that's non. So again, don't know if you say you're like, who's that says Rob Schneider. Somebody said he was a republican. It was he, I think he said it, but it was just lays up fucking vaccine denier and he's carrying a lot of weird shit. But it's like if you. That's not liberal, you know, like kind of I guess the vaccine. There's a lot of vaccine deniers, really liberal, but it's such a weird thing that if you do something that's not the norm out here, everyone just treats you like a bag of shit and you're like, yeah, I don't feel like I don't have that problem because I'm not an actor. I'm a writer and I do stand up. But also I don't know if it's because I moved out here. I'm 37 so I didn't move out here at 19 starry eyed with five roommates and inefficiency, you know, like I'm super vulnerable to other ideas.

Speaker 2:          01:45:28       I've been working. I have a stock portfolio. I bought a house so I didn't really give a shit the way that I think that if you come out here so early you're totally affected by it. Yeah. Well I've met a lot of people that were really young when they came out here and I met them young when they were out here. Like I did a show once back in the day with this guy who was an actor and he was like 22 and he was this handsome guy and he was trying so hard to fucking be the that God, you know, and we were talking about. Do you remember that Jack Nicholson movie with um, Helen Hunt thing is called as good as it gets? Yeah. I fucking hated that movie. I hated that movie with every fiber of my being and one of the reasons why I hated it because I felt sad that this woman who's a single mom and she seemed really nice and Jack Nicholson's a piece of shit and asshole and she's stuck with them and this is as good as you get.

Speaker 2:          01:46:21       That was the whole idea of it. And then this is fucking ridiculous idea that he was racist because he needed medication. So they gave him medication. He stopped being racist, like what the fuck kind of movie is I guess grows. And so he and I were having this conversation because it was the movie that everybody enjoy. Everyone did she, it was amazing. Yeah. She wanted an Oscar for it and so he and I were having this conversation. He was doing that thing that they do where if it is something that everybody likes, he likes it and, and I go, I fucking hated that movie. And he's like, why? He goes, it's amazing movie. I go, is amazing. I go, what the fuck is cheese? This poor woman was this kid and he says old cut. And she stuck with them and he was getting any better.

Speaker 2:          01:47:03       So she'd rather sickly kid be around that. Yeah. Creepy dude with sunglasses on. So he goes, actually, I thought he had a lot to offer. I go, what? What did you just say? He had a lot to offer what but breathing. He's my hanging around her money and she didn't what it that mean? It's like the whole. Yeah, the purpose of that movie was disgusting, but when I had this conversation with him about it, it became clear really early on when I started chipping away at it, like, what was it that got you about the movie where it would, would, would go well, but got him. Is it everybody? Was saying they liked it, everybody said they liked it. So you wanted to say he liked it. So he was just wracking his brain for. What was that one thing that person said about it?

Speaker 2:          01:47:43       He's an interesting case because he, he got real, real hot real quick, like people were really into them. But then they found out he was Kinda dumb and it just drifted away. It just ended. So I thought that was okay in Hollywood you can only be so dumb. He was real super dumb. There's a lot of people that they get like a little bit of juice in the beginning and like wow, it's really starting to happen, should I not? And then the juice cuts off. Sure. And then some new one with maybe better cheeks or something. I mean everybody has their moments and getting hot and then cold and you know, you hope if you get cold you get hot, you know? Yeah. But it's really fucking stupid. I don't know, like during that whole Chris Brown thing, that's my only like examples. Of course I was getting invited to be on shows and talk about it and I declined everything.

Speaker 2:          01:48:33       It was like, no, I'm not good for you. I was like, absolutely not. I wasn't the Chris Brown things. We talked about it before the podcast, but if people don't know Chris Brown obviously was in trouble because of beat up or Yana and that whole thing and you know, the domestic violence issue and you tweeted something at him. What did you tweet? Well, it was like my lowest form of comedy. Writing is the celebrity reach weight. It's because I can't think of anything else and I'll just go to my favorite targets like camera Kim Kardashians and I only make fun of when they write something stupid. I never, I never ever, like I've never talked about some of these looks their weight there, you know, like it's just something dumb. And with his, you know what he did, he's a horrible person and he had showed no signs of remorse.

Speaker 2:          01:49:18       Like he kept doing shit. He threw a chair through the window and good morning America and Robert and Robert's interviews. Yeah. Well, I mean like asking him about it and apparently they had made some sort of an agreement where they weren't going to bring up with domestic violence. I'm here to talk about my album, but the whole thing is, it's like how he channeled his rage, throwing a chair through a fucking window really couldn't. So I was born child and so I was born and he had tweeted something like, man, I look old as fuck and I'm only 23.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       And so I retweeted it and I was like, I know being a worthless piece of shit can really age. I thought it was funny and then all of a sudden like I look at my replies on my phone and it will look like that waterfall of just like, all of a sudden it was like a thousand $2,000. I'm like, Holy Shit, whoops. What did I do? And then I realized he was coming back, like Gino telling me to suck his dick. I'm like, no, your mother must be so. But like I just, I played with them. It was a Sunday. I was bored. And like next thing I know is like he deleted his entire twitter account and I'm like wow, that's not what I meant to say. One of the shit in your mouth too sharp in my eye. Your eye retina to be your specific.

Speaker 1:          01:50:36       I don't know. I think he was trying to sound smart beam accuracy. Does he have with his is even the back of the eye. It's on, in the front. Like he didn't even think. It's just trying to sound smart and I on your retina. I was just laughing away and I like he said like ask Rhiannon if she mad. I'm like ask Ryanna if she man. So like I tweeted back and then I linked his police report to that tweet is a. I thought it was funny and we went back and forth for awhile and then he deleted his account and that's when it became a thing. Did he put it back up? Is this. It was, yeah, it wasn't really like down for like a couple of weeks or something like that. You delete your account when you put it back to you get all your followers back.

Speaker 1:          01:51:15       Do you have to start from scratch now? You just start from scratch, but I. He has the most insane, Loyal Group of idiots that follow him. Just misspelled death threats all day long is what I got was just misspelled death threats. I was like, well, you know, whoops. But then the next day I was like, my manager, like I love the call that I got. She's like, Jenny, what did you do? A lot of messages here. And I was like, yeah, no, my bad was like, just tell them all no. And she's like, okay. And she goes, are you sure you don't want to? I've got good ones to view Larry King. I'll. I was like, no view was a good one. How hilarious. She was laughing. She was totally not promoting this and she's got some good ones I want you to be on. We got Larry King, we got the view and I was like, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          01:52:04       I don't want to do it because I didn't want to. That's not my intention. It was just so happened. That's something that I thought he wasn't going to take. They get pissed about, like, that ended up being something and it wasn't how I wanted to make my, yeah, self known, you know, and I just, at that point I already had like, you know, 300,000 followers. It wasn't like I didn't. Yeah, it was just starting out and I was trying to get fame or something off of it, but you doing what you do. I was doing what I do and it went somewhere that I didn't ask. I was like, ah, yeah, no, I don't want to do that. And I think about it and like I wonder if people would. Somebody said something one time, did that bother you that that was when you hot?

Speaker 1:          01:52:45       I was like, no, that is not when I was a hot maybe to you. To me that was like, the low was be like dipping, you know. No, it was not my finest hour. I was not proud of that moment at all. I don't regret it, but I don't. I'm certainly not going to go sit on the show and talk about how wonderful I am. It's like, no, I look at what I wrote. I called it like a fucking ignorant fucking that Rosa parks. Just something near like some heroes, like no, he was a piece of shit and I was just, I like acknowledging that. Yeah, that's it. I wish I knew what happened with them. I know he beat her and I know you should never beat. You shouldn't beat anybody. You definitely shouldn't beat someone you love. You definitely shouldn't be the girl if you're a guy.

Speaker 1:          01:53:29       But I want to know what she did. No, she might have punched him in the face too. And he punched her back or. Well, I mean the whole police report is like, you know, which he, he actually acknowledged at all was she took his phone and there was another chick texting and she was like, what the fuck, you know, but they're driving and then he punched her in the mouth and then just kept punching or driving around. It was like a 30 minute torture session. Like what? Yeah, like he beat her head until it says and dot whatever her actual last name is. Her mouth filled with blood tooth chipped a. So he doesn't hit him at all now. She didn't hit him at all. She kept trying to get out of the car and. But then they break up. Of course she got a restraining order and then when that ended she got back together with him.

Speaker 1:          01:54:09       Probably give some good Dick. I guess. So. I mean I guess I don't know if she forgave him. Shouldn't, maybe shouldn't have been fucking with his phone. Maybe she should have kept her hands where they belong. Not on his phone, but that was such a like, I mean it was such a, you know, when I started getting all I'm like, oh my God, my mom is going to like read the shit that I wrote. Like I was more just going on. That was your daughter and that guy was hitting your daughter and then just, Oh, I'm getting back together with him. Yeah. I just, who knows, man, who knows what the fuck. They're really luck or what she's really like. She's obviously a little crazy too. Yeah. I mean she'd have to be like a little. But I think people that are that talented are just fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:55:00       Anyway. Remember her, who's talented? Her. She's very talented. Her voice. Yeah. But a lot of people can say you don't think she's talented? Well, it's just because I think she's, she saw him for getting back together with them. You know, like, I have a hard time getting past that. I don't, but I don't even listen to new music anyway. I'm like, sit down with an old person driving around, listening to lithium. Serious. That's. Do what do you listen? Like what's, what's your kind of music? I'm not kidding you. That's probably it. I listened to that eighties, nineties first wave. You're like Pandora or Nirvana fan? Uh, I like Nirvana already soaked in bleach. I did. I didn't really care for it. What'd you think about it? I didn't like it. The movie, the documentary that thinks that Courtney

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       love out. Pardon? Kurt? Purveyance death. I've seen how many documentaries are there about him? There's a few. There's a lot. There's a, there's some real shitty ones. The HBO One, right? Yeah. Montage of heck. I didn't see the reenactment crap. That was terrible. I was out. I couldn't finish it actually because I'm like, I can't watch bad acting. Like I thought it was a documentary and if I'm watching actors pretend to be and it's somebody else's version of it, you know, it, it felt like, no. Yeah, I agree with you in that sense. But I don't think they had rights to anything else. I think she owns the rights to Kurt, you know, so like I don't think they could do anything else if they wanted to show that movie and depict those stories and how do you just not do it? Well then they just write a book.

Speaker 3:          01:56:37       The problem is people won't read books and another problem is if you want people to pay attention, you would have to listen to her actual voice saying a bunch of crazy shit which is in that documentary when you hear her actual voice lying about like having a drug overdose and making these publicity stunts and lying to him about where she found the suicide note or you know, when she said she found it under the bed or under the pillows and he's like, well here's the problem with that. I checked other pillows. We chucked under all the pills. We checked on there everything. We scoured that room and she said, yeah. I says like what? Like when you hear that and then when you see the actual physical evidence of her copying Kurt cobain's handwriting and then you see the difference between the suicide note, which is three mostly like seven, eight suicide note is him talking about non related stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:57:29       And then the last tiny portion of it is the suicide note, which is clearly an indifferent handwriting. Bigger letters. And they're like, Whoa, did she fucking write this? Like it still doesn't mean that she killed them. It couldn't mean that crazy bitch wrote a suicide note for him to make herself look awesome that he loved them. Just fucking crazy. She's fucking crazy if I know, but I don't think there's anybody that believes that she's not crazy. Exactly. Exactly. I would be. I don't think there's a person that would go nuts. She's totally safe, so she could be out of her mind. She could be a liar. She can be all those things. It's still not be guilty of murder, but there's nothing in that documentary that shows that she killed him. There's nothing. It's just that it just shows she's nuts. Which everybody already knew.

Speaker 3:          01:58:14       Yeah. That's when it like it. Everyone made a big deal about it and I just like the reenacting really took me completely picture, but I've seen so many things. Like everyone knows she's batshit. It wouldn't surprise me at all if she did that, but. Well the, the, the sheriff killed the police work is so piss poor. That was the, one of the most disturbing things about it. When you find out what was it, like 94 when he died or something like that was like 1974. And so we're pre internet. So the accountability was minimal. Small town, you know, ate a small area and then it was uh, the Seattle police department. The sheriff was a fucking idiot, fucked up a bunch of other cases. Eventually he was kicked out. There was all sorts of bad police work going on on top of that. The difference between the first responders accounts of the murder scene versus his response.

Speaker 3:          01:59:03       Um, the difference between the image of the fucking. It's allergies, I'm the first responder said you could clearly tell who it is and then you know, their, their version of it, that his face was blown off like, well those are two different versions of the fact that they cremated him six days later. The fact that they called it a suicide instantly before the autopsy was performed, that you're supposed to leave that to a forensic scientists to go over the evidence. They just as a cluster fuck, but in that cluster fuck, but don't try to kill themselves. I don't believe anything. I don't know. I do not know. The other thing is I don't know. I don't understand heroin. So when they say that he had three times the lethal dose of heroin in his system and that he wouldn't have been able to pull the trigger.

Speaker 3:          01:59:48       I don't know if that's true. I don't know if maybe he had an insane tolerance because he did a lot of heroin. Yeah, like maybe three times for you and I, but not three times for him. I don't know. I don't know. But it was, it was creepy. It's creepy documentary. I mean that whole story. That whole metal seem as creepy as shit. I mean, even like when, uh, uh, what's his face? Scott Weiland it, read that he passed away. I mean, it's so terrible, but I felt like every single person was like, well, that was going to Scott Weiland. I met him. He did. Dana White's a birthday party dean and while he was president of the UFC and performed stone temple pilots performed at his birthday party and cool for were swollen. We just say they were fucking amazing like three times and every time they were awesome.

Speaker 3:          02:00:33       They performed in a, in a ballroom for. I mean maybe there was like 200 people there and the people that were paying attention when they went on stage, it was like maybe 40, like we had to get people up towards the stage to pay attention. That motherfucker rocked out. Like he was in front of $25,000. Sold out rabid fans. I mean he, he hit it hard. I remember being humbled. I remember seeing seeing that and going, wow, like that guy. It made me want to do stand up better and maybe like, man, I want to go right. I want to, I want to work on my performing because that guy fucking nailed it. Gave everything but backstage he was willing. He was a disaster because my friends that had to deal with him, the friends that worked for the UFC, that had to like, like he, he, he demanded to go on like right now or he's getting out of there. He's going to fucking leave. I'm on my fucking money. I want to go on right now like he was just cracked out of his mind or heroin out or whatever the fuck he was doing. He just, he was like barely you there all the time and always on edge and you know, you could blame it on his creative juices

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       inside of him that made him such a genius performer, which are, which is undeniable that he was a genius, like performance wise and mean. He put on a show like every time I ever saw him, that band play that he was amazing. But yeah. Did you read what the mother of his children said about them? Like that rolling stone thing him so fucked up and then you would go to be married to that and you have children with that guy and then he had new children with their new wife and then just sort of didn't talk to the old. And of course obviously that's her, her story. Who knows how crazy she is, who knows what the reality of it. You could die and your ex boyfriend could write a fucking crazy book about yearning to be like, you know, all fiction. Yeah, we don't know, but this is set.

Speaker 2:          02:02:23       That's a fucking crazy drug. That heroin. Oh, I would never in a million years touch that. What if it made you like so good. What have you. What have you got a little bit of heroin and microdose. Afraid. Microdose. I'd be the one that would die like the first time trying died first. I'm trying it. I'm like, no, I gotta let to live for it. And they find out it's averse reaction to Claritin, Claritin, d. Oh, you took the color and the day that 24 hour yet. Now you're fucked. You fucked up. You fucked up girl. It seems to have an awesome effect on musicians so well until they die. Yeah, but up until up until age 27. After that, it seems to drop off radically. This is like all the age. Twenty seven people, right? Janis Joplin, Morrison a Hendrix winehouse. I'm Kurt cobain. Yeah, they all. It's all 27.

Speaker 2:          02:03:14       So bizarre. At 27 is the age that everybody just Illuminati. It's like that five thing. It is high five HIV. That's actually what I have. That's why it's the age coming out of your nose. The night agencies. We've got to touch it. AIDS AIDS is acronym. Yeah. It's like, is there a drug that has a more unique relationship to music than heroin? I don't think so. The only comedian that I knew that was a heroine guy was Hedberg and Mitch Hedberg had like a sort of almost like a jazzy sort of sense of humor and it was like a weird. Even his voice, he spoke and everything. It was like, it was like a cool cat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He would do his act sometimes with his back to the crowd. It would turn and do it and kill. He was killing it wouldn't even looking at everybody.

Speaker 2:          02:04:07       Well, there's something about that confidence due to do something that just fucking outrageous. Turn your back to the crowd but not give a shit. You're not nervous. Like they, they would sniff you out if you were like, yeah, you're scared, but it's like he had such control over everybody that he just could do it and everybody would laugh. Well, he was a unique guy in that for a long time. He had a real problem, a following certain acts like when they would say if you get booked in like the funny bone and Columbus, right. If you get there, if,

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       unless you are a big draw to the point where you say, Hey, I'm bringing my opening acts with me. They would book local people and so they would have some guy like I know a story where he went to this club. They had a local guy, local guy before him. His fucking literally doing handstands. He's singing and dancing. He has music. He plays, he does a wrap to close. He closed with a wrapped audience, goes crazy, and then Hedberg goes up there with sunglasses on, stands in front of the microphone and says, somebody asked me if I want a banana frozen banana. I said, no, but I want a regular banana later. So yes, that's funny. But not after some dudes doing flips and standing on his head and then shooting rockets on his dick. You know, the guy might be exaggerating, but you know, there's like.

Speaker 3:          02:05:23       So he would bomb. He would have these horrible sets until he found his audience and then when people knew what to expect, like from lettermen appearances and what have you, then they knew what to expect and it would go to cm and then finally they started doing the opening act correctly and that guy had a really hard time though because of the way we so specific, like the kind of comedy, like you could probably go anywhere and you could check the crowd out and go like, you could figure it, you know, in your head when something is working, what they like and what they don't like, you know, even depends if someone's there to see Gilbert Melendez, not in the Gilbert Melendez, he's a fighter. Medical. What's his name? No, no. God dammit. Who the fuck am I thinking of? Fluffy. Oh, Jesus Christ. Gilbert. Gabriel Gilbert. Like Gabriel Iglesias. It's super family friendly, very squeaky clean.

Speaker 3:          02:06:21       Very funny, but very fluffy laughing. If I went on and told some dark shit after that or some, it's just not my crowd. Wrong crowd for me or on a group of old people that went to see, you know, whatever, fill in the blank with like a really good carrot tops, some squeaky clean and that's just, you can get the wrong crowd for sure. You know, there's some crowds that just don't work for you for your style of humor, but like if you were going on a show and it's like you Anthony Jeselnik and bill burr wouldn't matter. Right. It's all the same. We've done that 20, 30 times at the comedy store. That's I think probably in my head. Well the store you'll have, but that, you know, someone might go on and. Well they're really good at the store, like setting the lineup and it really sort of homogenous way. I did a horrible show there. I rarely do the some girl I guess was trying to put together a show and it was like bring her show. I don't know what it was. Yeah, they'll do like, I didn't want my room. Is it a weeknight in the main room? It was like Monday night in the main room with a shadows. Never first time. Ooh, I'm in main room, eight people, you know, it was just mad. It was just absolutely bad. Everything I said bomb like nothing. And I was just going

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       like, how many more minutes do a red light? Could you flick that at me? I mean it was just, it was bad, but I didn't like, this is not my crowd. Like

Speaker 3:          02:07:45       they had a show there the other day and uh, I got there, excuse me. I got there and the waitresses are like, dude, go to the main room, see this fucking show in the main room. I go, what's going on? They go a cult rented out the main room and I go, what are you serious? So I went in there and when I went in there, the show was just ending. The comedy show was just ending. So some comedian was onstage. I didn't, I don't know who the comedian was and it just wasn't going so well. I was going okay. But it was just very, very strange. And then after the show they all huddled up around mother, mother, this woman that they called mother who was the head of the cult and there's like 50 people around her. They're all dressed to the nines suits and ties like the nicest dresses, like everybody's dressed up, like they're going to a, a, an award show, right.

Speaker 3:          02:08:32       And mother sat around with her back to the stage where they're all facing her. Like as if she was on stage, I mean she might as well have been on stage and she was talking like, you know, like really like self help, nonsense, sort of fucking cookie cutter scientology style, talking about, you know, our intention, what we put out into the world is what the world gives us back. If you love yourself, the world loves that kind of Shit. And they were all like cheering along with it and clapping with her and say it was so fucking strange. It was so strange.

Speaker 1:          02:09:06       But they rented the room like how did they even rent them?

Speaker 3:          02:09:08       Don't understand what happened. I don't know what happened because I got there late, you know, I got there like as it was ending, the last comment was onstage, but Al Madrigal had been on earlier and it was just fucking eaten deck up there and he apparently goes, what the fuck kind of crowd is this. Like he was saying it while he was up there because he realized he looked out and he sees all these people with suits and ties and dresses and they're all there. They're all fucking super lost. I mean like really lost strange people. I'll never forget first sitting there and then gathered around her, talking to her, listening to her every hang on every word she says. We saw bird feeding its babies spit and it was all just waiting for it. A hallmark card. Shit. It was fucking strange. Really strange. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:09:56       Well that whole self help thing, you know if you are, if you're so inclined you can piece together, especially today like it's not. We're not talking about like Anthony Robbins days of 1988 or nobody else was doing it and you had to actually have some really concise thoughts about how to improve yourself. They're repeating other people. Nobody's come up with something brand spanking new. Exactly. Yeah, but you. All you have to do is sort of mind the internet for these things, repackage them, reshape them and put on a seminar and have all these people together and there's people that are doing that. Right? That voice and that's just that weird, odd look. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       I watched that documentary. The source family. Do you ever see that one? No, I haven't, but it's pretty Whitney. Cummings was telling me I have to see it. It's good because I don't think anybody really heard of it because the guy didn't like do a Mass Jones, you know, like he fucking got an angle either in Hawaii and said, Jesus wants me to fly out and then say, yeah, he didn't make it. Maybe that's how Jesus wanted them to come to him. I was like, oh, he didn't kill his people. He just was like, nope. I'm getting vibes that I need to go on this hang glider on this cliff and that's a fucked up way to go, but actually he survived and then died like a few, you know, one or two days later, something like that. But Oh, less, less exciting. But it was fun.

Speaker 2:          02:11:18       Yeah. I'm sure. Maybe that's what he was hoping for, but hang gliding seems like a fucking great time, but I'm not trying it. No. I need to like, uh, no, I couldn't do that. Well, you have to depend on the wind. I don't like depending on things like that. I'm not into depending on wind, it seems like a, it does whatever the fuck it wants. Doesn't want to listen. It's weird. Yeah. It's like tell him no, that would be like floating in the water on a boat, sailing around on a boat in and all of a sudden the boat decides it doesn't want to be buoyant and that's kind of what you're doing. You're floating in the air depending upon these drafts with whoops, fucking reflux. Claritin, like a cat. But if, I mean, I think that can happen right? The wind just dies off and you just follow him around much.

Speaker 2:          02:12:10       I grew up with the coast. I mean, Shit. I wouldn't go fucking hang gliding. Hell no, but that guy did because he had his son told him getting a sign that I need to hang. Glide. Well, nothing's more nerdy than those wingsuit dudes. I had this dude andy stumped in here who has the world record for wingsuit travel. That shit's insane. I just watched something on it and this guy, I mean they're nuts and they'll break like every fucking boner. Don't back out there. I've got to get back out. Yeah. One Guy, he, he hit his foot on the edge of a rock and then just going, you know, who knows how my fucking fast. Yeah, I did see that. Like everything. Yeah, I'm broke. All of his shitty lived. Got Right back on it. That's how awesome wingsuit flying his break everything. You have to be there like you have to have somethings you're wired differently because that's not.

Speaker 2:          02:13:03       We have to be wired differently to try it in the first place. Right. I mean, who would go flying squirrel suit, you know, fuck this shit, this shit to work. It must be so fun though. I imagine it is fun. But boy, I mean, have you ever done a hoverboard? You know, those little roller board things. So this little segue, but it doesn't have a handle. You know, those things that they see the kids do. Well, yeah, I have, they're fun right there. They are fun. But those kids, it's just like two teenagers need to be on wheels. Like the little kids have them. I know. But you know when you select those lazy fucking kids in the mall just walking and then now they're just, it's so don't you feel that's one of those things where the technology comes along before they have rules. Like remember when people used to be able to smoke those e-cigarettes on planes, they just be puffing on those blue e-cigarettes like who's that fucking goofy guy that was doing. Yes, yes. When I saw him fucking hockey and I was freedom to seeing you in a movie in 1990. Like this is what you're doing. Like what he had to. But I love it. He was still like, yeah, it's me. Stephen Dorff. Take back your guys. Come on guys. Take back your freedom. There it is. Look, come on guys.

Speaker 2:          02:14:21       There's just something so non rebel about sucking on a little robot Dick. Yeah. It looks like they're sucking on a home pregnancy. Otherwise those things are great. Before you go on stage, they'll look like tobacco or nicotine rather is a stimulant and it is actually a good stimulant to take before you go on stage. Really fires up your brain. Joey Diaz told me about it so it gets me fired up right before and wants to other vape pens that had like the, all those big giant fucking like you're holding onto a lunchbox and the ones that have like the marijuana oils and I'm. Oh I have those right here. You won't want to travel. What kinds of you have? I have all of them. You name it. I have. Do you have the g pen? I got one of those. I have a friend that does a friend, a friend of mine that does marketing ops endorsed. We have like a fucking stack of them back there. Right. Those cheap pens. My friend Bunbee from UGK. Oh Shit. Yeah. The best ones are the ones that have the oil. Was the one that you screw the top off. You plug them into USB plot.

Speaker 2:          02:15:24       I'll call my doctor. He was my friend who hasn't met. I got my prescription from a doctor as well. No, I don't have. I don't even have one, but he. My friend has one, so I was like, Hey, if you're up and you're going to go get me some lessons. This is broadcast nationally. You do have one, right? You do have a prescription. You're not taking marijuana illegally. Right? I'm totally teasing. You don't even have one. You don't even have to have one now. I don't even have a vape and I was just. Oh, you're kidding. It's just fiction. It is Joe. It was one of my friends. Has it. Do five guys trying to sound cool. You one of the cool kids. Shouldn't be one of the cool kids. Did you mess with edibles? She's nodding. I have in my previous life. Have you had any bad experiences? Yeah. Yeah. Everybody has. Everybody's happy because you don't know how much and it wasn't edibles. It was the. I was always the brown. He said everybody started with and I was in college and I remember like it was a costume party. It was around Halloween so everyone's at the bar and costume and I couldn't find my sister and roommate because my sister and I went to the same college. I was walking in circles because they were dressed like

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       other people and I was like

Speaker 1:          02:16:34       fucking nightmare scenario. And then finally they came up to me and they're like, you walk past like 30 times and you look off. Freaked out. I was like, it doesn't help. I have big eyes too, so I'm like, just so fucking panicky and jumpy. Oh God. It scared the shit. I just went back to my apartment and later I was like, just make it. Stop. Make it stop.

Speaker 3:          02:16:53       Yeah. I was a judge of the Cannabis Cup once. I don't even know what that is. The Cannabis Cup is this thing where they judge a weed and they decide like, what's the best, is it like one of those beer? It's way worse. Here's the thing, you don't have any idea which one is hitting you better or not or you don't know like this is what the, you know, like um, like old people have like those Monday through Sunday pillow things and each one, you know, you pop them open and you take it. It was that. It would give you one of those. I said I had it with a dried wheat in it for like the longest sitting on. I'm like, I'm going to save this and I put it away. Just does a nostalgia for the highest I've ever been in my life. So I get there.

Speaker 3:          02:17:36       They give everybody that's a judge. They asked me to be a, just to give everybody who's a judge, one of these little boxes with all these different strains in it and each one has a name and you know, Blah Blah Blah. Now the name, you're supposed to start smoking it. Yeah. So you started some, but you don't know what, what's getting you high and what's not your highest fuck? First of all, we went into this place that they did it. It was just this place on melrose. It was like a head shop in the back of the head shop. They had this big giant room where all these people ran and I remember just being just completely blitzed out of my mind by the time I got to Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday I am fucked up man and people are handing me cookies and I'm just eating them.

Speaker 3:          02:18:17       They're just eating them. People are handing me bags like those a volcano bags. I'm fucking sucking on a volcano bag. I just went as deep as I've ever gone in my life. How many days before you came to? I was legitimately high for 24 hours. Like I'm not like legitimately. Did you do anything? No, no, no. Were you just sitting? I just laid down after it was over. I remember thinking I can't even. I don't even. I can't even form sentences. I can't. Like I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't know this is, this is I got, I got so high that people stopped, they stopped looking like people to me and what they started being is like two dimensional, like a cardboard cut out like a movie Promo cutout of a person and then behind that person was like their soul. It was like peeking around the corner, like looking at you like they were walking towards you with this like cardboard cutout and behind them this.

Speaker 3:          02:19:13       That's how the, that's like the impression that I got from looking at them. There's just like a two dimensional outside and then I could occasionally seek glimpses of the real self, like peeking around the corner looking at me and then Heidi, I was terrified. Yeah. I was just, I was, I was untethered, untethered from reality from life. I, I was, I was gone and I remember having this weird conversation with this. Here's the thing about these marijuana people, especially marijuana, this is what we're were talking like I think I was a judge in 2003, something like that. Two thousand two are still in your system from the problem. Probably still test positive, but the people that were into it, the really involved in the quote unquote cannabis community. It was a small sort of tight knit group that we're producing it and selling it and growing it and they would gather together so these, they would use these things as an excuse to kind of get together with everybody and that kind of in this conversation with this guy who was banking on the cannabis community, taking care of him when he was old and that's what he was like concentrating on like it was.

Speaker 3:          02:20:17       I was so high, just had to listen. I couldn't even talk. I was wearing and he was saying, well, this amazing thing is the cannabis community. Like they're gonna have me, they're going to take care of me. The cannabis community will be there for you. So right. Nk with them or something, you know, he thought the cannabis community was like the small, tight knit thing and now it's a swarm of humanity. Even if there is no cannabis community, homey. It's called life. Yeah. It's just humans. But to him it was like, you know, like local growers or whatever it was like this local organic community of work. So it was just a strange conversation like that was his angle was almost like he was like really into pot because it had given him an identity within this community. So he was expressing that to me in this very strange way and almost trying to like wrap my head around like what he thought was gonna happen, you know. But he kept saying that, you know, the cannabis community, so always going to take care of me, the cannabis community. I'm like, guess what dude? The canvas community, just fucking people like, people are just going to take care of it.

Speaker 1:          02:21:16       Another stoner dude got out of the room, one of my roommates in college one time just ate a shit ton of pot brownies and she wanted to go to Wendy's for food of course. And she's like, what do you tending to Wendy's some food? I was like, sure. In my car she's in. As soon as I go through the drive through and you're going to, Wendy's going to take your order. She goes, Dr, just get out of here. That's when it really hit her part in that person's saying, welcome to Wendy's. He lost her shit. If I don't drive, she's going to jump out of my car. Like she was really like freaked out. Like just go, just go. Just try. Just try. I'm sorry. Oh No, it's not good. But yeah, pot eating pot can really fuck with you in a way that nothing else can be any and it won't go away. There's nothing you can take or do. You will have to wait it out. And one thing that helps a little bit is coffee. Coffee does copy cat, but I mean if you're so whacked out you're just like, I just want to sit in a chair and wait this, ride this out.

Speaker 3:          02:22:23       Do you know the different wall? Here's. I've talked about this so many times before. People gonna get annoyed, but do you know what happens when you eat it? That there's a different like biological processes opposed to smoking? When you smoke it, you're your body's reacting to Thc, which is the active compound when you smoke it, but when you eat it, it's processed by your liver and it produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than thc. It's insanely powerful and it's a much more psychedelic drug. Like you'll have hallucinations and especially if you close your eyes, you can have some really, really intense. That freaks me out too much in the moment. I close my eyes. I'm like, oh, well. I was on both when I was at the Cannabis Cup. That was what was so fucked up because I had been high from smoking it.

Speaker 3:          02:23:10       I don't know anything horrible. Throwing it up was great. If it's alcohol, if you throw up and you drink alcohol, you know it gets out of your system and you, you, it helps you sober up quicker. But like if I was, you know, we all do it stupid. We don't know how we can take when we're in college and I would drink until I was like, just, you know, hammered and then I will. Oh yeah, I'll look that. And then I always appeared that'd be the only time I'd ever puke was when I did that. And I'm like, yeah, I need to learn. We'll. It's also because when you smoke you, you become hyper aware and you're body is aware of the poison side to you in the form of alcohol. And your body's like, what did you do? Get it out.

Speaker 3:          02:23:52       I took a, uh, a pot that sky made thc pills. It was this, a friend of mine, they were like, he figured out how to make pills and I don't know how he did it, but he made them in these capsules. And um, you, you have to, it has to be. There's something that has to be fat soluble. Like, like when you cook it, like a lot of times they cook or they use butter and they, they, they melt the marijuana into the butter that make it fat soluble. The make your body. So, I don't know the, understand the process, but he figured out how to do it and put it into capsule forms. So he told us, he was like, Yo, how much should I take? And he goes, just take one pill because they're a little packages of two pills that he gave us.

Speaker 3:          02:24:28       It was just take one. And my friend Eddie Bravo was like, fuck that guy. I'm taking it too. So he took two. I listened. I took one and I was fucking the blitzkrieg and I wound up talking to this guy and um, it was at a Jujitsu tournament and this guy was one of the competitors. And I remember thinking like, wow, this guy's vibe is so crazy. Like he's giving me like, when you really hot, maybe it was just because I'm that high, like insanely dangerous vibe about him. Turns out he was a rapist, turned into a rapist and um, uh, was on the run and uh, went on the run and we went to a Jujitsu tournament. No, no, no. He was, he was a rapist. He had done some other shit too. One of the things he had done, he had choked to death and then they revived him. He got in a street fight on a traffic incident. One of those mayhem or whatever. Those. No, no, I'm, I'm forgetting.

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       I forget her name. More machines now. That was another one. He was on my podcast and actually just a couple months before he did that with the girl that he beat the fuck out if she was here. Oh God. That's the worst sounding story I ever. I saw the whole thing on real sports. They did it. Yeah. I did. On real sports on HBO is terrible. Yeah, that was terrible. That whole thing was a combination of everything is all the abuse that he suffered in his life. Steroids, this fucking brain damage that he unquestionably has. So many of them have. Brain damage is so many fighters. Same Shit. The football players. Yeah. They snap the chronic and syphilis. Yep. Yeah. Try it. Well, cte, so just any form of head trauma over repeated periods of time. Scared cause issues, but they keep talking about football players and like you can't tell me that like Nascar drivers don't have that shit.

Speaker 2:          02:26:18       They reckon you have concussions all the time. I don't think they were rick that much though, but it just takes a little like once it's, you know, once you've had one concussion it's easier to get another and a lot of those drivers have had multiple concussions. That's interesting. I never really thought about that. I would think about different people like hockey. Sure. Certainly. But it always seems to go to just football. But you're like, no, this. I mean I know plenty. I like car racing but like a lot of the open will, you know, even if they have just a barely at rec, but it's still there. Had, you know, they have all the head neck restraints on it, but you hit the side of a wall, you brand squash around. You've already had three concussions maybe in the past. So with all the connective tissue, the connective tissue that holds your brain inside your skull, that stuff tears.

Speaker 2:          02:27:07       And when it tears it doesn't come back. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, I resilient. It's like it's done. That's it. I've, I didn't know like what that stuff was like, like what is the connected tissue leg until I butchered a moose once and uh, yeah, let's go right here. And when we're lifting up the leg and cutting the connective tissue, it's like almost like this, like candy, like, like, uh, what's that stuff called? Cotton candy fibers look and stuff that's like, it's so soft. It just cuts right through. It's like, I'm like, this is similar to the stuff that holds your brain in your head and you can imagine over repeated traumatic impacts like over and over again. That stuff would just start tearing and breaking news. And then once it's torn, like you're fucked. Like your head's just rattling around. Yeah, yeah. Scary. Well, I have a friend of mine, a good friend of mine who's an expert in traumatic brain injuries. He's a doctor and he treats a lot of soldiers, football players, the like. And he said that you can get a concussion, a severe concussion. I'm getting hit in the chest like a lot of football players, they had impact. They get hit in the chest, but the, that the chest snapped your head back and your brain rattles around inside your head and it gives you a massive concussion and they, the ignorant

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       people that didn't know any better, you know, ignorant as far as it didn't have the information they would, they would say, oh, I didn't even get hit in the head. He's fine, but no, that just getting hit in the chest. Like if someone kicks you in the chest, you can get a concussion. I hope nobody ever kicks me in the chest. I hope nobody kicks you in the chest to not be a fan of that suck. But if they did like you see your brain gets fucked up. Have you ever had a concussion? Oh yeah. I'm sure you're sure, but you don't know for a fact that you had one piece of kickbox. So did you ever have where you were at the hospital and they said, no, no, no, but I definitely had headaches and get punched in the head a bunch of times. I've been hit in the head a gang at times. I'm just definitely in. Here's the thing about concussions and traumatic brain injury, like people think that it's just a concussion. Uh, you are concussed and defined concussion, you know, oh, your pupils are dilated and you get hit in the head. No, you like small impacts, repeated subconcussive impacts. Sometimes I have the most devastating effect. Like soccer players oftentimes develop the same sort of symptoms from heading the ball. Just a ball, bouncing a ball off your head. No concussion.

Speaker 1:          02:29:31       I would have, um, I've never had a concussion, but I assume that I've done damage from surfing or wakeboarding. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, you know, you would know it. Take you a minute. Like you really wipe out and you're just like laying there, like take a deep breath. Like, okay, I'm going to sit the next few. Dr Mark Gordon

Speaker 3:          02:29:53       was saying that you can get it from wakeboarding or I'm not. Sorry, I'm jet skiing. Just hitting weights

Speaker 1:          02:29:59       jarring. Exactly. It really like when you hit, if you're, you know, every time I'd be out on the boat or somebody that you go into a wave and that kind of like, boom, yeah, it's good enough. Fuck, you get off the boat and you're just like kind of. We could fill a little rattled. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that Shit's bad for you. Not Good. Not Good.

Speaker 3:          02:30:18       I would imagine ski jumping, ship boom. Like that. All those fucking downhill skiers like the ones that the Olympics and the fuck, they wiped the fuck out. Oh, they fucking wipe out those a snowboarder. Dudes do. Oh, they wipe out hard. My friend who got knocked out recently fucking snowboarding. He. You ever seen that document up on his back? Oh really has no idea what the fuck you did? Just woke up. It was fucked up for awhile. But this is like a second or third time going out like that too. Like falling snowboard. He loves snowboarding though. But Jesus

Speaker 1:          02:30:53       point again, like I like walking and breathing and living on my own. Remembering where I live. Not having somebody like, you know, take me to the bathroom. Like, well for football players you've seen those. If you've seen the real sports episode. I am

Speaker 3:          02:31:08       NFL players from the seventies and eighties that are just jobs.

Speaker 1:          02:31:13       Well, the one I saw, it was a pbs frontline that was about those concussions and, and it was, I mean, the guy's just, they're not the same person, they're just fucked. I mean they've just done a number on their bodies and you don't bounce back after so many just hoping that one day they're going to figure out how to inject stem cells in your brain or something like that to reinvigorate it. But yeah, as of right now, they really can't do much. Are you a football fan? Not really, no, but like growing up. Okay. So you know, you think about you'd see a big hit, it would make this know wide world of sports real or some shit like that. And you're like, do you want to watch it again? It's just insane. And everyone's like, yeah, and they're fucking and now I see it. And I'm like, yeah, that guy that just shaved about 10 years old, you know, like, and he's probably lost however many lost whatever function of his brain that they say is like your emotions and your decision making. And that's why a lot of those guys will shoot their girlfriend killed themselves and we're going to show one jamie.

Speaker 3:          02:32:16       Oh,

Speaker 1:          02:32:17       oh. And then you can always tell my guys this recent. Jamie. Yeah. This was two weeks ago. You can tell the knockout when the hand stamp. Oh yeah. No,

Speaker 3:          02:32:27       believe me. I know, I've seen. I've probably seen more people get knocked unconscious in real life then I would, I would, I would really, without any reservation say that I've seen more people get knocked out then zero, zero point one, one, one percent of the population. I'm like in the, like the smallest group of people, like there's maybe a hundred or 200 people on the planet that have seen more people get knocked out than me. Maybe

Speaker 1:          02:32:59       I've seen people get knocked out not to that extent, but because of my sports producer I used to have to actually go to all the games. So I'd be on the sideline, you know, like. So I saw it, you know, like right there up close. And it is, I mean you just see it coming. You could see the guy coming. You can see his head turned the other way, has no idea what's you know, and then the moment he just lays down those arms just oh yeah, they just stay up until like

Speaker 3:          02:33:24       fuck. Well because of doing commentary for the UFC, I mean literally I've seen more knockouts than way more than 99 percent of the population. It's probably like 99 point nine, nine, nine, nine. There might be, there might be 20 people on earth that have seen more people get knocked out than me. It might really be that low because how long have you been doing that? I've done. I started doing the commentary from 97 and I started again. I did it from 97 and 98. Then I quit and then came back in 2002 with the new company and I've been doing it for the last 14 years. But you've seen a lot of. But I also was fighting from the time I was 15, so was 15 to 22 was all kick boxing and martial arts. So I saw a lot of people get knocked out in person there and then I saw was just fucking done. God called like, I don't know man. It's way more than a thousand fights. It's probably close to 2000. So I've probably seen five or 600 people just get shut off. Just wham. Over the course of my life. Just Bong, crying, stiff arms, legs twitching, toes curled. I've seen that way more than 100 times, 200, 300 times. Yeah. It's madness. When you really stop,

Speaker 1:          02:34:39       think about it. I mean it's weird that like going from something I would watch and be like, oh, you know, watch it again to like, now I'm just going, Jeez, you know, me too. We're getting old. It's not fun anymore. Well, it's

Speaker 3:          02:34:53       becoming more and more aware. And plus like the knew will smith movie concussions coming out where people are starting to say no I haven't. Is it out already?

Speaker 1:          02:35:02       Yeah. Came on over Christmas, but I didn't do. I don't think what it should have. Yeah. I read something that there was like this long thing of discrepancies, like they chose to leave out because supposed to be a true story, you know, and, and they, they admitted very important facts. Oh look, because of the nfl of how they treated, you know, like there are certain things that I don't know who got behind what and like who kind of strong arm, strong arm them into like doing what leave that part out, but that part in or maybe try to avoid lawsuits to something like that. But I mean I used to think when I would hear people like, I mean I grew up in Texas too, so football was such a big thing. And how there would be people that would say, oh, I'd never, I'm not letting my son play football and your pussy and I get it now. Like I don't have kids, but I would say I get it. Like you see the results in these people. It just fogged.

Speaker 3:          02:35:57       I get it. Yeah. Well I mean if boy, if my kids wanted to fight, I would be very conservative about it. I'd have to. I'd have to really try to get it into their head to understand defense before anything really. You have to like the most important thing to practice is learning how to avoid being hit and how to.

Speaker 1:          02:36:15       Yeah. I mean I took like, I took karate as a kid, everything, but you know, my dad was like, you never start a fight. He's like, but if somebody ever tried to hurt you, he's like, Jimmy, I just punched him right in the nose and keep doing it until like, but defend yourself, don't, you know, don't dance around them and talk shit, you know. And I was like, okay, well avoiding fights is always to get in a fight. Don't hit me. I'd be so upset. Why don't you do that? Well just if you didn't avoid it and you got hurt, badly hurt. Yeah. And something you could have avoided it feel so stupid. It would have been forever. Yeah. That you're the one that started it and then you get the shit kicked out of you. Cooler heads. Prevail is always a good thing to focus on. It's just sad.

Speaker 3:          02:37:02       It's almost always whatever the fuck it is that people fight over, it's almost always going to be worked out. Most of the time. People just want to fight when they're drunk and that's the difference between alcohol and pot. Nobody fought at the Cannabis Cup,

Speaker 2:          02:37:17       those fucking people, and even had a fight that day. I want to just grab it. Let's just slowly answer for say, Hey, slow dance me and you man talk. Come on man. I don't know what to tell you about, but let's talk. Fuck the people come out of a bar to fire it up. It is the worst drug when it comes to that. The worst, the worst job because it narrows your understanding of the danger that you're involved in. Loosens inhibition impedes rational thinking and it's always somebody that's so fucking hammered, but they can't even put one foot in front of the other, but in their mind they're seeing something completely different and they always end up getting the shit knocked out of them. I've seen it, seen it a bunch of times. It's horrible. It's seen. Street fights is always so strange too because sometimes you see street fights with people that are so confident and they literally have no idea how to fight and you're like, why are you so?

Speaker 2:          02:38:11       What are you doing? You don't even. Maybe they beat up somebody that was really scrawny. They're like, it's going to happen to get that good God. Look at that big giant bouncer. I got this and you're. I always want to like if you ever met someone that like they become a different person when they get drunk, they drink and then like a switch goes off. If they're not, they're like, hey, when Jenny go with Jenny, Jenny in there, and those eyes are just like, they get gerbils, hamsters and then you say something, then it's usually the people that get mad really easily. We were just having fun like, well fuck this shit, fuck this fuck of. And was looking at me. Yeah, because your drink's empty. Like what the hell happened to you? Where'd you go? Kind of amazing that. So few fights do take place.

Speaker 2:          02:39:01       When you think about how much alcohol is available and how many people drink, it's kind of amazing when you go out and you don't see a fight, which is more often than not. Right? Depends on where you're at. I think when I was in Austin, so you've got on sixth street and it's a good place. It was. It would be weird to not see a fight on sixth street, but then if you go to a place that's like a nicer, you know, okay, these are adults instead of a bunch of just college kids that are ripped. You don't see as many, but that's true. I saw a lot in Austin. That was pretty, pretty common. Well, college towns and then you got Texas people and then he got booze and you throw it all together. A lot of fucking Johan.

Speaker 2:          02:39:43       It's a great town though. I love great town. A town. It's getting choked up with people though these days. Everybody wants to live there now. Why is that? Don't know. It's cool as shit to do. It's a nice place. That was fun. Like I said, it's a good atmosphere. It's not. I think it's laid back that help traffic. There's insane. No, yeah, that's started becoming like just. Yeah, it's overwhelming. Their infrastructure can't really handle it because it's not designed for that many people and, and everything's consistently under construction that never get, you know, it's just like everything. There's just, you know, they're all going gonna be a new building that's going to be it. Okay. So we have to close that street off and that straight offs. Traffic's now worse.

Speaker 2:          02:40:26       It's a problem. But it is a very unique city in Texas too because it's got its own vibe to it as opposed to. Yeah, I mean this is the capital, but it's got its own vibe to it that's different than any other Texas city. It's so liberal and open minded and sweared. I mean I think that like I worked downtown and where the office, where our station was was right there next to the capital, so it was kinda cool. It was on Congress and you could walk around. It was, you know, I didn't live very far. I mean I was still young so I had a little cool dope ass little high rise, you know, it was fun, but I, I feel like every time I go back it's just thousands more people. Oh yeah. We'll do some nutty number of people move there every day.

Speaker 2:          02:41:10       It was like a thousand people moved there everyday or something like that. Something insane. Something really ridiculous. And it is sprawling because you can go out towards the lakes and all those kind of houses. How many people move to Austin every day? Google that. I bet there's a statistic, but yeah, by the lake will the lakes. They used to be two lakes, right? Lake Austin, Lake Travis and Lake Travis had fucking become nothing but there was town lake and then yeah, like travis is now, like just speed boats. Everybody filled up again. It was down to nothing and it rained so hard. It filled back up again. That was pretty fucked up because nobody could even get in the water due to the bacteria. It's only 110. One hundred and 50. That's it. That's nothing. Oh, when for 2014. So two years ago, how much much difference to that doesn't seem like a lot though because 150 people move in and 40 people move out.

Speaker 2:          02:42:07       So it's 110 net. That doesn't seem that bad. But it is over the course of years. Right? Yeah. Well so much for my fucking outrageous hyperbole, hyperbole. Kinda almost. It is almost. Almost close. Yeah. Close enough. It's sucks. Three hundred 60,000 people a year. No, week 50 2:52 weeks. One of my shitty math again. Boy. Fucking relying on calculators. Oh Man. I have to rely on calculators. So we're almost out of time. Jenny Johnson. High Five. Where people. Where can people see you do stand up next? When are you next? Uh, where am I performing next? I believe that I have anything this week. Maybe next week. Maybe next week. Okay. I'd probably put it up on your twitter and let people know what I'm on my, a gram on my instagram. Cool. I'll let people know. Please do. I will. All right. Jenny Johnson high five me on. Oh, by the way, my cousin Andy next. He's Moraine, major, fly [inaudible], big fan of yours, so thank you andy. I told him I would tell you that. All right, well thanks. This was fun. Appreciate it. Let's do it again. We can be sponsored by Claritin D. we'll do it again when it's not raining. Perfect. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you Johnson. Ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker 8:          02:43:43       Yeah.
