Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hello Freaks, here we go again. This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you buy naturebox. Naturebox is a company that sends healthier snacks to your door. Now I really appreciate my message board because every time anyone claims anything now people fucking crawl up their ass with a microscope and find out what's cracking. And one of the big things about naturebox is people go, this stuff's not healthy. We're not talking about Kale or grapes or, or, or blueberries. It is healthy and quite delicious. Um, I'm, I'll tell you, what are these things? I'm smitten with these things. I may get addicted. They're sweet blueberry almonds. Oh, they're so delicious. I'm not sure what's in there because I don't have my glasses on. I need glasses to read. Fine print. I thought, why? Why the fuck did they put fine print on box unpackages where they know that anyone over 12 can't read that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       All right, that's ridiculous. It puts them print on. I know it's illegal thing they're putting print on so that you know, like you can get away with it, but you should, you should have it on there. Where people can fucking read. So I asked naturebox what is, uh, what's the deal, is it, is it healthy? And their response was very reasonable and they said their products are all natural and containing much higher quality ingredients than the typical vending machine food ingredients which makes them healthier. They have over 100 snacks to choose from and if you're looking for something for certain dietary needs, like wheat free, which I, I, I'm a gluten free person because I'm very trendy, a low sugar content, a gluten free, which is basically the same thing. I don't know why they had to be redundant. Uh, they have it to, whenever possible they also try to use non gmo food as well.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Although that's a thing about gmo. It's not necessarily unhealthy to eat GMO. It's very tricky anyway. Their products are made from wholesome ingredients. And our nutritionist approved. They abide by strict quality standards, no high fructose corn syrup, no partially hydrogenated oils, no trans fats, no artificial sweeteners, no artificial flavors, no artificial colors. All sounds good to me. And like I said, I've been enjoying these snacks. They're very delicious. It's good to have laying around things that you don't feel terrible about eating. And as I said, they do have things like pretzels, okay, which are impossible to make healthy. They're fucking pretzels. Uh, and that was one of the things that was brought up on our message board. But again, I appreciate you guys. You guys are fact checking motherfuckers, but check out naturebox. They have some really delicious stuff. A barbecued kettle corn, which is really good stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       I'm a South Pacific plan team chips, that's one another, one of my favorites. Zero Trans Fats, zero high fructose corn syrup, nothing artificial.

We are also brought to you by squarespace, squarespace, one of my favorite podcast sponsors because I have many friends that have used this, a sponsor to make their own websites and I recently met the people that are responsible for this company in New York.

Speaker 1:          00:03:40       Excellent folks, and the product is really fantastic. For the longest time, if you wanted to have a professional website, you really had to either learn html or you had to hire someone to do it and it was a huge pain in the ass. Squarespace offers you a very simple drag and drop solution that is quite excellent. It also works on everything. It works on ipads, works on android phones, it works on windows, it works on pc. They offer 24 slash seven support and they've even launched a logo creator. If you're thinking about opening up a company and you want a logo, they have a very simple logo creator. We can create a clean and simple logo design yourself in minutes. You can start an online store quite easily. Not Difficult at all. Brian Red Band who's not here today but has made dozens of websites while we've been doing shows during commercials.

Speaker 1:          00:04:34       He's actually constructed. Oh, that's good. Jamie, you learning from Brian said Brian's name. You did just like him. Um, the, the, the, uh, drag and drop interface is super easy to use. You could literally make websites during the time that it takes to do a commercial now, no bullshit. They also have a new health website that will deliver a better customer experience. And for a free child free child, is that a child or as trial?

Another thing I like about squarespace, they allow you to try it out before you enter in your credit card information.

Speaker 1:          00:05:22       So if you're thinking about making a website and like, let me see what the squarespace shit is all about. You can actually enter in, um, you know, all the stuff, build a website and then say I liked it. Then you put in your credit card. It's a beautiful thing. Squarespace.com. Use the code word Joe. Save yourself some money. We're also brought to you by on it.com. O n n I, t on it is a human optimization website. We basically sell things to allow human beings to reach your potential, whether it's physically strength and conditioning equipment, whether it's cognitively, which I don't think is a word through things like Alpha brain or new mood with new moon is a five htp supplement if you've never heard of five htp five HDP is actually a supplement that allows your brain to build more Serotonin, actually can enhance your mood.

Speaker 1:          00:06:16       So much so that people who are on Ssri eyes, which is a serotonin uptake inhibitor, people are on antidepressants essentially. Um, they tell you not to take things like new mood because new mood and the antidepressant together might actually give you too much. There are Tonin, which is not good, but if you're interested, go all the science behind all the supplements are available at [inaudible] dot com, whether it's Alpha brain, whether it's new mood, any of the supplements are explained with science. And also with the research has posted with references. Uh, we recently completed a clinical test. The first of a, another. We were in the process of doing another one right now. A much larger one. The first one was a pilot test. It was 20 people a couple dropped out, so I think we were left with 17 or 16, but we had excellent results and the results are published at [inaudible] dot com.

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       It's o, n n I t these are all very expensive to do. And the, um, the process of selling supplements is a very controversial thing because there's a lot of bullshit out there. I personally believe in supplements. I've been taking supplements my whole life, not my whole life. When I was a baby, I took nothing. How about that took mom's milk, I guess as a supplement. But since I knew about vitamins and supplementation, I've always been interested in optimizing my health, optimizing my fitness, optimizing the way my brain functions. And uh, I've been a big fan of nootropics. I got turned onto them by, um, by neuro one, which is bill Roman [inaudible] company built Roman house if you don't know who he is, he's a former pro football player who was experiencing a lot of what we're hearing about today in the news about pro football players.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       A lot of these guys get busted up from football, develop a lot of cognitive problems, and he wanted to combat that with nutrition. So he developed a product called [inaudible]. That was my introduction to the world of nootropics from um, uh, Alice from Sarah and no name in San Francisco. I got into that and then started researching all the various supplements before we ever created Alpha brain. I'm Alpha brain is what I believe is the best combination of all of the known ingredients that can increase cognitive function. And again, if you go to [inaudible] dot com, all of the science behind all the various ingredients individually is referenced. And then on top of that, all of the, uh, the, all the research that we've done and the study that was just recently completed is also referenced. We also have a 100 percent 30 pill, 90 day money back guarantee it on it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:49       We're not trying to sell any bullshit. And we, the last thing I personally want is anybody feeling ripped off. That is also the last thing Aubrey wants. Who is my partner in this? We sell you the best shit we can find and we try to sell it to you at a reasonable rate. That includes strength and conditioning equipment like kettle bells and battle ropes. And that includes health and nutrition things. Supplements like a hemp protein powder or hemp force bars. All of it is available on a.com. It's o, n n I t go there. Enjoy it. Get your freak on. All Right, ladies and gentlemen, Louis Theroux is here and I'm very excited to talk to him. So let's just get cracking

Speaker 2:          00:09:32       experience. Joe Rogan podcasts all day. Can you not hear that?

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       The headphones? Is that what's going on there? Just too loud. Too loud. Jamie. Wants you hook them up. This is probably something that we should do before the podcast starts. Doo Doo do. Is that better? Is that better? Is that beautiful? Louis? First of all, thank you very much for doing this. I'm a huge fan. I've enjoyed your work over the years. You have had probably one of the most unique views of Americans as an outsider. I think possibly ever, you know, your shows are all about. I mean, if I wanted to think if I was like a conspiracy nut and I wanted to thank like me, man, this guy is probably like an, an anti American propaganda is what he's done is found the wackiest Americans ever known and, and put them on television and shown just how fucked up we really can be. But uh, your shows are really excellent. Thank you very much. I don't remember which one I got turned onto was many, many years ago, but, uh, I've watched. I went on a marathon last night. Last night I watched the wrestling one, I watched the African hunting one. I watched the Indian Gurus, one are watched the born again Christian one. I went on like a five hour Louis Marathon last night. I lived to tell the tale. That's a lot. What, what got you started in exploring all these bizarre human beings?

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       Oh Man. I've always, I've always had a kind of fascination with the dark side of human nature and with lifestyle outsiders and you know, it goes so deep with me that I don't remember ever formulating a conscious decision to explore weirdness. For me, it just came naturally from, you know, from when I was very, very young. I was, I remember my dad having a things about the Ku Klux Klan laying around the house and, and reading them and thinking like, wow, it's so weird. And it just sort of. And then I used to subscribe to a magazine called the unexplained that was all about a conspiracy theories and use bows and esp. And I remember I subscribe to that. And so it's always been part of my natural environment. And then, uh, my dad's American. So it felt very natural for me to come to America at a certain point after the fact, after I left university. And then once I was here I just felt like I was tuning into something different and strange.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       Well, you're a perfect guy for what you've done because you're so friendly and so amiable, like when you're around these bizarre fucking freaks, you, you put them at ease to a certain extent.

Speaker 3:          00:12:07       Right? Right. And I, and, and again, it wasn't something I sought out to do consciously. I just, my natural mode is to try and be ingratiating. I mean, I'm not a confrontational person, have quite a cowardly person. I, you know, and I, and I, I try and avoid conflict and so I have a natural strategy in life, you know, it's not something I just do on my programs in life. I try to, um, get along with people and put people at their ease if possible. At the same time, I also have a kind of inquisitive side. And so sometimes I get my questions answered by asking a difficult question politely. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       I don't think you're a coward at all. I mean, I think you're being very self deprecating right now because you might avoid conflict if you could, and, and I do as well, but you're also very brave and the situations that you've put yourself in, you know, you, you've thrust yourself into some very bizarre circumstances.

Speaker 3:          00:13:04       Well, you know, um, you know, maybe I'm more, I am county, but I'm more afraid of the consequences of I'm somehow not delivering on a creative idea than I am of the danger that fulfilling it involves, if that makes sense. So sometimes you're in a spot where the story, you know, people say you must be afraid when you're out on location, you know, what I'm afraid of is going home without a story. Like that's what keeps me awake at night. Like are we actually going to get any usable material? So I was in Johannesburg doing a story on crime in Joburg where the police are hugely under resourced. And so a private security agencies go around policing the streets. They're heavily armed, they're accountable to no one. And yet after. So we went out to do this story and after about two weeks of being there, we hadn't really seen any violent crime and I was getting to the point of we got to go and cause some crimes ourself if we have to, like we got to get the story. And so there was a, I, I tended to thrust myself into dangerous situations just out of a sense of panic, you know, that we weren't kind of doing what we were supposed to do.

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       That's hilarious. So essentially what's going on in South Africa is like a lot of what happened where was criticized the American military started using mercenaries that we're accountable to no one black water and the like. And that was a huge, huge issue because these folks were, we're doing a lot of things that if soldiers had done them, they would be responsible for war crimes, but they fell into this very strange and gray area because they were mercenaries because it was. Yeah, that's

Speaker 3:          00:14:42       a great story. And in fact we spent a long time looking at trying to do that story and getting into blackwater. They rebranded themselves as something else now, but um, and the fact that these private citizens essentially, because they weren't servants of the state, they were, um, the citizens of private companies, but they were still in Iraq, but accountable to no government because they could commit crimes more or less in Iraq, but be a go and arrested and unprosecuted because they were in this legal gray area.

Speaker 1:          00:15:13       They changed their name twice. Actually. Black water was x e dot a dot and then they changed the name to academy with an I at the end of it. So they just very strange. Yeah. Well I think they don't understand the internet, so they probably did

Speaker 3:          00:15:27       figures that may work for people.

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       Sure. For a little bit, for a bit. For anybody who doesn't use google. Yeah. Sort of work.

Speaker 3:          00:15:34       That's what, that's why con artists changed their name.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       Yes. Yes. I mean, it's interesting that, I mean, but this is how beautiful the Internet is. I didn't remember what the name was. I found out while you were in the middle of a sentence and then by the time you were done, I had the answer, which is pretty incredible. We live in strange times. I have a friend who went to blackwater. He was a, uh, he was in the marines. He was a sniper and then he got a job with blackwater and he didn't like to talk about any of this stuff that he did, but he did it for money and he went over and made a tremendous amount of money over. They did more than one tour with blackwater, but it's very disturbing that that is, uh, this, this gray area and these words that we use like in surgeon and contractor. Those are also disturbing. Like contractor, you know, like, Oh, you're a contractor. You're, you're a mercenary. No, no, no. Contractor contractor to me is the guy who fixes your house, you know, a contract to me as a guy that you hire and he, you know, he builds a, an addition onto your home. It's not a fucking sniper,

Speaker 3:          00:16:37       but it's across the board as well because, you know, I've done several stories on, on prisons and there is a, um, there are private prisons as well. And, and if I could make a general observation, it's that what I found in the course of making documentaries is that nine times out of 10 you get more access and more accountability from a public agency from, I mean I've been inside and spent weeks inside San Quentin prison and Miami jail and a maximum security mental hospital for pdf files here in California. And all of those open their doors to us and I just wonder around and document what was going on in a way that I thought was very laudable. I didn't agree with all the practices that were going on. And yet if they're private prisons, they, they don't feel like opening up their doors they've got, they don't feel the same sense of public trust. And that's, that's just a personal observation.

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       Well, they also, they're a business and that's a real issue. And anything that you say that's negative could negatively impact their bottom line. They can make less money because of you and so there's no benefit in having you there. Whereas the public outrage in a, in a public institution is to have a real impact. You know, the public can actually vote to get people out of positions that are causing certain rules to be in effect.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       You can't really do that with private prisons. Private prisons are, in my opinion, one of the most disturbing aspects of the current situation that we're in right now because so few people are actually aware of what's going on. Most folks who have nine to five jobs plus whatever commute time and family, they don't have the time to research any of this stuff and they're really unaware of what's going on that we have this good percentage of our prisons in this country, in this country are actually businesses. They're making money and even more disturbing. They're lobbying to make sure that certain laws are in place so that they can ensure that they have more people in their prisons and make more money. It's very creepy. Scary stuff. It really is. You. You've been to the public prisons. Yes, and didn't know private prisons. They wouldn't be here. No, no, no. Yeah, we've never. I mean it's, it's. If you can just talk into the alternate towards you, like it's a story. I'd be. Oh, that's better. Yeah, much better. It's a story I'd be interested in telling, but uh, we, you know, very Hong King. I'm a, I'm a victim of, of, of access, you know, I can only really tell the stories that, um, that I get inside, you know, I, I sort of like, well maybe I should. I'm like a vampire. I have to be invited in.

Speaker 4:          00:19:13       That's only so many a horror movies though. That's my, my issue with the recent trend of vampires that they just fuck around with the rules. Like blade was the first word the vampires could wear sunscreen that go outside. I remember I wanted a piece of paper up and threw it at my tv. When I saw that, I was like, yeah, I'll fight. You can't fucking wear sunscreen. You changed the rules. Well, Wesley snipes was a vampire, right? He was half vampire, but he was a day walker. He was allowed. You have to wear sunscreen as well. He did not. He was allowed because he was half vampire. It'd be a good guest for your show. Yes, he would. Yes, I would enjoy having. Is he at? Is he at liberty now? He was, he was doing time for tax evasion. Um, I wonder what he can say or what he would say if I was him, I'd probably keep my mouth shut.

Speaker 4:          00:19:59       They locked him in a cage for several years and not only that, they didn't allow him to just pay the money back. They imprisoned him, which is really disturbing to me because if someone owes you money, you should just have to pay that money back. And the government is different when you owe money to the government, they decide that we're going to put you in a cage. And he had gotten a, I don't know his full story. I've never met Wesley, but he had gotten some really shitty advice from someone. And if you're, I think he was part of a religious group. Do you know that side of the story called the New Orleans? And it was, there was some kind of Egypt to logical dimension to it and there's a, I think there is a pyramid somewhere outside Atlanta and Georgia where they wish it. Does this ring any bells with you?

Speaker 4:          00:20:46       Well, I know that his is a secessionist idea that we don't really belong to the US state, that we are our own sovereign in a weird way. It kind of aligns with certain aspects of the sovereign citizen movement where you see yourself as not beholden to the federal government and an independent entity. Why? No, he's his, his production company was like almond raw productions. I believe it would make sense. Yeah. He's got a big thing with, uh, with Egypt and, but I believe his thing was constitutional. His argument against taxes, you know, there's, there's a bunch of people in this country that state that federal income tax is actually unconstitutional. Exactly. Yeah. So it was for him, it was a philosophical position. I don't know if it was or was not. I think it was, but it was a ridiculous position. He just can't fucking not pay taxes in this country, this couch.

Speaker 4:          00:21:39       Neat. Without a doubt, this country is run by by money, without a doubt. They need money and anyone who comes along and fucks up that system and says, Hey, you know, we don't have to give money. What, what, how, what percentage of the United States runs on taxes? A pretty large percentage. If someone comes along and fucks with that, they're just going to throw you in a cage when it doesn't work on kind of ethical grounds because, well, if you're driving on the roads, you're using tax dollars and on pragmatic grounds it doesn't work because they will send you to jail. A pragmatic grounds of the most important, the, the ethical grounds about the roads. There's a, there's a large argument for that for sure. But then there's also weirdness like in New York where it used to be that they set up the toll systems on the bridges and the tunnels and what was going to happen is once the bridges were paid off, then the tolls would stop.

Speaker 4:          00:22:30       But the state and the city obviously got addicted to all that money that keeps coming in from those tolls. So even though the bridges are long since paid for, they still, it still costs like nine bucks every time you go across whatever the fuck. It's really ridiculous. Now when I was living there it was much less, but it's, you know, it's a substantial amount of revenue that they're just not willing to give up. So it doesn't matter if it's paid for, the money has to keep coming in. And then of course the money funds is bloated bureaucracy that keeps expanding in order to keep itself alive. Like any other organism that continues to expand and just gets more and more ridiculous and needs tax money to stay open. So a guy like Wesley snipes, it comes along and says, I'm not paying taxes. You know, it's hard for everybody to be sympathetic to that because here's a guy that makes millions of dollars, doesn't want to pay taxes. And the regular folks that have to pay taxes and make a fraction of that, like they don't have any sympathy for a guy like that. Plus he's half vampire indeed. Yeah, indeed. So I don't, I don't know what, uh, with his current situations, I may have a chance to meet him in Dallas. Apparently there's a martial arts thing that is going on in Dallas. There's a UFC event, ultimate fighting championship event and there's

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       also like a, something that he may attend a, I'm, I get a chance to meet him. If I get to talk to him, I would definitely bring them on here. I was supposed to fight him at one point in time, get off how we're supposed to have a mixed martial arts fight. Several years ago before he went into jail, he, um, he owed a lot of money in taxes and a promoter, one of the original promoters for the ultimate fighting championship. Uh, apparently he contacted them and wanted to have a mixed martial arts fight in order to make some money. And they contacted me and offered me some ridiculous amount of money and I said, yeah, I'll fight that guy. Fuck that guy for that much money. But, uh, he changed his mind after a time went on and I'm sure he was embroiled in legal battles and there might've been some chemicals involved in his decision making.

Speaker 1:          00:24:31       So have you bought a, I mean, is that something you used to be a taekwondo champion before I was ever a standup comedian. And uh, I've done martial arts pretty much my whole life. I've got a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu, black belt in taekwondo of kickbox. I fought probably a hundred taekwondo matches somewhere around there from age 15 to 21. That's pretty much all I did. Since you've been a, you know, an older man, have, you know. No, it's not, it's not advisable to do unless it's absolutely necessary. And I wouldn't do it now if I was given the same offer, but back then it was like five or six years ago. It was a tremendous amount of money. And he, he's not a, he doesn't know Jujitsu, you know, he doesn't have a background in that he's experienced and striking. And if you've never experienced, if you don't have an experience in, in grappling, a person who does have experience in grappling can pretty much have their way with you.

Speaker 1:          00:25:31       It's very disturbing. I found that out firsthand when I first started taking Jujitsu in 1996. I thought I knew martial arts, I was going to take Jujitsu and I'll get fucking awesome at this too. And I just got strangled and manhandled over and over again for years. It was a long, brutal, painful, humiliating process of learning. And that's one of the things that was sort of exposed in the very first ultimate fighting championships. If you don't understand grappling, if you don't understand Jujitsu and submissions, you're almost helpless. And uh, that's Kinda what I was banking on. I was banking on just kind of grabbing him, choking him and I, my background was standup martial arts was striking to. I mean I competed and I knew he had never competed. He was a trained martial artist who is apparently really good, like in the gym. But I thought it was probably a good idea to do. Sounds like he got off lightly. Who knows, I mean anything can happen when people are throwing punches and kicks out each other. It's a crazy business. You know, as I've been doing commentary for the UFC since I started, I did a post fight interviews in [inaudible] 97 and I've done commentary since 2002. So how

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       many, many, many years. And I've learned along the way that crazy shit can happen. People are throwing bombs at each other. It's a. have you ever done a show on mixed martial arts? It's, it's an interesting question because we, it's one of the few times when knowing that we approach a story because it feels like it should be right for us and then it doesn't pan out for whatever reason. So I'm well aware of your work with the UFC and about three years ago we spent a couple of months really trying to crack it as a story and then what happened was we didn't get what we were trying to do, mma and we and we didn't get access to the UFC or not good enough access. So we will look at the second tier, but it's quite a big drop off from the UFC down to the smaller leagues.

Speaker 3:          00:27:29       There was a guy we were dealing with, cold terry, triple cork. I know him, you know him. He's King of the cage. I always liked that name. So that was why I remembered it. Yeah. Trouble cocs coc, you know, I wonder if we should get together with Jean tripplehorn ha. But, but I, uh, he, he ran it. I don't remember what his league was called. Do you know what you're thinking of the cage? King of the cage. So we spent a bit of time with them. They were doing a series of fights up in northern Michigan. Uh, and it was kind of interesting, but there was another one we would, and part of the same shoot we looked to a, an outfit that I want to say it was cops versus cons or does that ring a bell? Wow. No, I'm sure. I'm sure it's out there though.

Speaker 3:          00:28:12       And they did. They did felony fights as well. You're aware of them, but they'd sort of cleaned up since felony fights was very brutal, very hardcore ex felons, a really wailing on each other in in a way that was hard to watch teeth literally popping out. And have you seen any of those videos? I saw one where a guy bid a guy's face, held the man down and bit his face. It's hard. Some of this horrible, horrible, really horrible. The full range, you know, that's if you have a spectrum of fights, that's probably the darkest, but the guy in charge of it had got religion and he had. He'd started a new outfit and he sort of. He was. He was in the awkward maneuver of trying to edge away from the brutal super brutal, horrible stuff into a, into a lighter mode, more acceptable, fair but without, but still kind of trying to keep his brand viable.

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       And, and his new thing was called something like cops versus cons. And the concept was it was law enforcement personnel fighting representatives of the criminal fraternity. Does that not ring a bell is going to help him with Jesus. That was his. Because it was like he wants to show how a, there was some rationale, like he wants to show how we can all be on the same team and kind of fight and then shake hands at the end of the day and there's not a big difference between cops and the street street brawlers oh, that sounds like a spin them. It was a kind of a spin, but when it got down to it, it was. It was nowhere near as brutal as what he'd doing with felony fights. And the reason we didn't pursue the story was it became clear that it was actually a sport like it. And if anything to my mind, and correct me if you think I'm wrong, but less brutal than boxing, that you take more punishment because the. Because boxing bouts for so long and possibly because of the gloves as well, you're getting more brain injuries through boxing and that compared with boxing and even maybe you know, nfl football and stuff. That was like, it wasn't that questionable what the UFC or the or the mma guys were doing. They were just going out there fighting and then shaking hands, hands

Speaker 1:          00:30:19       while there are certainly less animosity between fighters and much more comradery. In fact, two men who were probably two of the best in the world, Leo Machida and Chris Weidman who are going to fight for the UFC. Middleweight title Weidman is the current champion they met recently at a seminar or some some convention and there's a photo of them together, smiling, holding like arm and arm. I mean these guys are in a couple months, they're going to try to kill each other, but yet they're smiling and very friendly. It's very common for people to be friendly both before and after the fights and there's. With martial arts, the true martial art mentality is not one of thuggish nature. It's not one of it's. There's a photo of those two guys. Those are the Weidman. The guy on the left with the monster milk shirt on is the current champion and the other Guy Leo Machida.

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       The one on the right is the number one contender who's two amazing fighters are gonna fight and you see them hugging and smiling before they're about to fight. The Weidman, who is a wrestler, which I consider one of the very best martial arts and Machida is a karate master, a true martial artists. Machida, he really embodies what you expect from a martial artist in the bowing he practices Cada. He's very disciplined, meditates, and really is, um, what you would expect in a sort of a movie version of a martial arts competitor, a martial arts master, except he really truly is a real deal. But I think that that attitude, the martial arts attitude is, is one of the more appealing aspects of fighting where it's not like a Mike Tyson, you know, the sort of a thuggish, you know, insulting. There's some of that in mma as well, but it's very rare and boxing that you get someone who has the martial arts ideals or an ethics that sort of competes.

Speaker 1:          00:32:16       But when it comes down to whether or not it's more or less dangerous, it really depends upon the bouts. And it depends upon the style that a person fights in. Um, if you look at like a floyd mayweather fight, floyd mayweather is probably like the least hit boxer of all time. If you wanted to argue that boxing is a super safe sport, watch a floyd mayweather fight. Watch how he fights, rarely gets hit and he gets hit and hurt much less than mixed martial arts fighters. I would think that his style of fighting is probably arguably one of the safest styles ever. But would martial arts in mixed martial arts provide is more options when a boxer gets hurt, they're not even allowed to hold on and clinch. Whereas with MMA, that's the number one strategy. If you get hit and you get stunned, you grab a hold of your opponent and try to take them to the ground and fight on the ground and having all these different options, it definitely gives you less a head impacts, but not really much less, you know? I mean there's still a lot of standup fighting involved. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:33:19       Is there any evidence of degenerative brain injury stemming from mma?

Speaker 1:          00:33:24       Most certainly. Yeah. Most certainly from long careers and from a lot of training, hard training, there's also, um, there's a bit of evolution going on right now. I'm in mixed martial arts as far as like how they train, how fighters train and there was a lack of knowledge and understanding about the proper way to go about training. In the old old days when it was first starting out were people would just try to be as rough and tough as possible so they would spar in the gym at 100 percent. They would basically have fights in the gym. They weren't just sparring matches, they were like full on fights. Your uh, your mic is on. So when you do that click is making noise, um, the full on fights where they don't do that anymore. Now it's very wise to rarely spar at 100 percent, most of the time spar at a lighter, lighter impact rate and a much more, much more on technique and much more on strategy and positioning and preserve yourself inside, uh, inside the gym.

Speaker 3:          00:34:27       And uh, so as I say, we abandoned it almost because of it's sense of feeling like there's the, it seemed healthy and normal in a non, you know, like kind of in a masculine. So you would only go after it if it was a freak show, you know, with that story we needed some extra dimension. I know and I think that possibly if we'd got to the top tier like with the UFC then that would, that would have been sufficient sort of show business gloss to it to fee or, or just a sense of stakes. But the guys we will, we were meeting, we're all part timers. They were guys who worked during the week, it's mechanic's teacher's personal trainers and every couple of weekends they would fight a few bouts. So it felt like a, I mean I don't, I'm not disrespecting them, but they were, they were not full time fighters and there was this, there was missing some kind of sense of scale or something. That's interesting. So you decided to not pursue the story left that one. We spent a few days on it and we thought, well, you know, it might be that there's a way of coming back to it at some point, like I said, the UFC side of it seemed more interesting, the sense of the personalities, the ways in which intersected

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       with this multimillion dollar business that they were running, that felt maybe more. Um, and we will look at, we're trying to find back yard backyard bounce as well, which if you remember a guy called, there was a guy called data something. Yes. Data five thousand five thousand, so $3,000. Mother fucker's name was. There was a scene in Florida have backyard mountain. So we were going to fit into it, but it was. And then they call him smokers. Yes. Do they still have smokers? Yes. They still do like a true smoker, which is going to be a what? No, no gloves. What kind of, what is a classic smoker? Kickboxing and boxing is where smokers really came from. And what it is, is essentially fights that would take place in the gym. And what they would do is wear head gear, boxing gloves, like sparring gloves, Shin Pads, which you don't see in a regular kickboxing.

Speaker 4:          00:36:29       And they would go at it essentially full clip in front of family and friends and it would be unsanctioned amateur bouts. The problem with a lot of these smokers is there was oftentimes no medical care whatsoever and they were just, you know, hoping that no one got badly injured and regulatory commissions frowned upon them because they were really competitions, but they were being labeled as non competitive sparring, you know, they were there were calling them sparring bouts. So I've also had smokers where they had full mma rules with little gloves and, and no pads at all. You know, they've done those and I'm sure they've had smokers where they had bare knuckle fights as well, especially during the, the formative days, like from 93 on. There was a lot of evolution in mixed martial arts. There's a lot of things going on and there was a lot of ways to skirt around the rules.

Speaker 4:          00:37:23       Like for the longest time it was illegal in California. And that's one of the ways king of the cage shine, just because king of the cage would put on bouts in Indian reservations when they would go to these native American reservations. The native American tribes could form their own rules. And so, uh, I went to see a lot of the king of the cage bouts in the nineties and when we would go see them, they were all on native American reservations. Then they also started doing a thing called pancrase fights and what pancreas fights where there was this strange rule, a loophole where you allowed to fight, but you could, you could slap, you couldn't close your fists and punch to the face, but you could pull your hands back and hit with the palms to the face and then kick full blast to the face, kick full blast to the body.

Speaker 4:          00:38:09       So there was a lot of those fights going on in the United States as well when there was no regulatory body for that. It just sort of fit into some strange loophole. But King of the cage is still one of those places right now where young fighters, when they're looking to get experience that they'll start to come up through that and that's still going. And is it? Yes. Yeah. I mean I just, I don't know how many bouts that guys had. Terry triple cock used to my, my friend Bud Brotzmann is a good buddy of mine, was also one of the original owners of that. And he got out and um, he became part of shark fights for awhile. It was another organization, but I don't think he does anything with them. I may now, but triple cox still going strong.

Speaker 3:          00:38:49       Um, another one that we never quite figured out was um, bare knuckle gypsy fighting it and we, I don't know if you have a sort of documentary cold, not cold. Yes. It's one of my favorite documentaries about Irish traveler families and the foods that go on between these families spending generations is the Joyce family and another family. Can't remember the name, but um, and the strange dynamic, it's just really weird. Like the family, they're very traditional that they got no money. They were very close to the soil kind of families and um, that they issue these like fight videos, like calling each other out into the fight saying like, you come and see me and tell you, you never instruct me access.

Speaker 3:          00:39:40       You have no courage. Yeah. And they. And they're very secretive and we spent about three or four months trying to get into that world. I always found it fascinating and the code of honor and that and the defending your name and the strangeness of the rules whereby there was all these, this whole code of have rules about if you were called out, you had to fight. If they insulted your dad, you have to fight. And then the kids getting groomed into it very young and, and we could never build trust with the families. But the guy who made knuckle, do you remember how he gets in with the families? No, no. He shoot. He gets invited to film one of their weddings as a videographer and so he films the wedding. He's like, this is really interesting. These families, they are wild. They can of drinking and fighting and getting married and having done one wedding, he, maybe there's another wedding and then he builds trust through, through the access, through the wedding videos. He parlays that into shooting the fight videos. And so, I mean, I was glad someone did it, you know, uh, it's really worth if listeners who haven't seen that, we should, should check out.

Speaker 4:          00:40:46       Yeah, it's a fascinating, fascinating documentary and there's so many of those call out videos that are available now. They put them up on Youtube now to really embarrass the person that they're calling out instead of just a video where you hand that cassette off to somebody else, like in the olden days, now they put these videos up on youtube and they're their damn hilarious. They're beautiful,

Speaker 3:          00:41:08       amazing stuff. I don't want them to stop. Does that exist in, in the states, in this, in the same way

Speaker 4:          00:41:12       as far as you know? Well, I'm sure there's probably a few people that have called people out to fights over the Internet, like travel, uh, fights gypsy fight. No, it's very different. It's very different. That's a uniquely European thing. I love it, just the language they use, it's just so unique and unusual. Ansys I also feel like that culture, the Gypsy

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       culture, it's, it's probably a culture that's not going to be around too many more generations.

Speaker 3:          00:41:39       It's very odd. Like people sometimes ask me what the strangest or the most difficult story have ever done and one of them was definitely a this gypsy one and it wasn't for lack of a story being at the story was there, but we just couldn't figure out how to get to it. And, and, and there was just no sense of you'd be having these conversations with the guy, you know, there was a guy who was um, very high up in the Gypsy community and he had a number of sons and he was big in the fighting world and he was, he was just connected in various ways, both legal and probably not legal and, and, but you will have conversations with them and just, you couldn't figure out what, what was real and what wasn't real. And there was a slight sense of, you know, they call non Gypsies Gorgeous.

Speaker 3:          00:42:24       That's a phrase they use scorcher gorgeous. I think it's Geo. Our Gis or maybe I'm in the spellings could vary, but we were gorgeous and I always felt that because we were gorgeous, you know, non Gypsies that he, that he is a gypsy, just felt like no, no real, uh, sense of needing to tell the truth to us a lot of the time, you know, I don't, I'm not trying to generalize. That will be, you're say that's true for all Gypsies are travelers, but, but for him it was like, because we were gorgeous if felt like, you know, we, we just didn't count.

Speaker 1:          00:42:55       Wow. Well it makes sense. I mean, what a tight knit culture. I mean these people are living in these caravans. Is these a, what do they call those? The, they don't call them trailers that they call them something else. Oh, well, caravans would be, it would be really cool. They call them caravans and they uh, what was that movie? Snatch? Sort of highlighted it with Brad Pitt. But these people, they travel, you know, and they, they set up shop in places and I have some friends from England and they have friends that live in this wealthy community, the suburban community outside of London. And these people apparently just moved into the area, set up their caravans, set up shop, and just started destroying the area. They started putting garbage everywhere. They started robbing people. They, I mean, and they can't do anything about it. Apparently. There's like massive protection of these people in, in England and they're trying to be polite about it and the way they, uh, they go about dealing with the situation and these folks that lived in these, you know, multimillion dollar estates are really kind of fucked.

Speaker 3:          00:44:02       Well, it's one of these situations where, um, it's, it's very hard to find the right line because on the one hand we're talking about a community that is heavily discriminated against, is deeply poor, has massive dislocation in various respects, very high rates of illiteracy, of Cha children not going to school, the children's health not being good. Um, and you know, having a massively out of work. And then at the, so, you know, by all normal, so barometers you'd think that's a community that needs help, but also there's various social, um, vices that go along with that. And um, so then it's, I think it's fair to say many of the, uh, the traveling folk are not well liked in, in rural areas and they are. And as a cultural thing too where they say like, it's not in our culture to I'm a stay in one place, we have to rove around and we have to be allowed to build a house in a field where you're not supposed to build houses.

Speaker 3:          00:45:03       So it's one of the, it's like one of these, you know, they can sort of make a cultural argument, say like, you, we're culturally, you can't. Our tradition is, it's like, you know, it's like a native American saying like we have to be allowed to kill whales, you know, like, you know, there's these debates and there's a spectrum of. And there's a point where you say like, well, it's your culture to mutilate female genitalia, but it's still illegal and you can't do it right. Or we say it's your culture to hunt whales. Well, we really want you to do that, but maybe you can hunt deer instead. It's our culture to, you know, so you've got to try and find. It's a trick.

Speaker 4:          00:45:36       Yeah, it's very tricky. The, the, the area about the hunting whales is a very unique one because I believe there's certain inuit tribes that are still allowed to hunt. Certain animals, like sealed are allowed to hunt seals and whales. I think on nails. I don't know, maybe some type of Wales. Um, I think in Alaska they allow certain inuits to hunt certain type of Wales. I think it's a very weird area though, where it, for anyone else, it's very illegal. Frowned upon endangered species. The fact that they're intelligent mammals, dolphins, you can't, but these people that have this long history of doing that somehow or another, it's preserved as a cultural artifact and it gets very tricky in the female genitalia. Mutilation is a very good example of that. But my friends who are from England, it's a horror story of these people that live in this community that is besieged by these gypsies. It's allowed to say Gypsies, Gypsies, like a sort of a negative term.

Speaker 3:          00:46:39       I think it's again, like I not, I'm not sure there's a show big show in Britain called my big fat gypsy wedding. So that made me think maybe it was, maybe it's not. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:46:48       Some of them have a problem. Well, the Eskimos one that apparently inuits don't like the term Eskimo, but yet they call themselves eskimos sometimes. It's very tricky. Um, but the, the, the people that I know that have friends that live in England, I mean to them it's like this, this horror story they lived in this beautiful, peaceful countryside is these elegant manners, beautiful states and multimillion dollar properties and these people just sort of destroyed it and now people are moving out and selling their homes and it's a pretty devastating according to my friend.

Speaker 3:          00:47:24       Yeah. So that's, I mean, you've got to have a law, you know, laws. We do need a few tools. We certainly do.

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       But the, you know, what is, you know, culture. That's where things get strange. Now what do we accept a clearly, you know, we moved, we meaning North Americans, whoever team here from Europe and wherever when they migrated here, encroached on native American land and sort of changed the whole rules. So what are the rules the remaining and that's where this whole Indian reservation thing comes into play here. We allowed them to set up shop and these areas usually that sucked places that the, you know, the new people didn't want it all. They allow, these native Americans have these areas and then they allowed them to sort of establish their own rules in these areas. So then that was fine for the longest time and they just sort of lived in poverty until they started making casinos. Then it got really strange because then non native Americans were allowed to invest in these casinos and then they established these crazy businesses where they make millions and millions and millions of dollars and they allow gambling, which is frowned upon everywhere else.

Speaker 3:          00:48:33       Again, it's very strange. Very strange. That's another one that I'd like to do a story on. It didn't, didn't figure out a way of doing, but you know, in talking about this, I think what was the realization I had was in the end of the stories I do on about wackiness in my view or even stuff that's kind of ethically dubious, although I sometimes go into those areas, it's more what I'm interested in is, is it's an angst and the and the deepest kinds of, of human angst where you are facing issues the emotionally take you to the core of your, of your, of your being and your soul. And in some cases it's, you know, it could be stuff that seems kind of dubious like the world. I've done a story on brothels or I did a story about porn performers and it's the strangest of taking the intimacy of the sex act and putting it on TV.

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       And then in, in other cases, it's stories where the angst is something where you're presented with a choice that is, um, is, is really through no fault of yours. Like you've got a parent who's got dementia, so a serious Alzheimer's and you or a loved one, let's say your husband who you been married to for 50 years, doesn't recognize you anymore and is having sex at his old people's home with some of the other women there are. You still married to him? And we did the story about dementia. And again, so that's not really about a choice.

Speaker 4:          00:49:58       Old people homes, they get down. What happens is we're in the post Viagara era. Ah, so they can get Viagra and the old people and some of the homes,

Speaker 3:          00:50:08       as I understand it there, I mean we didn't actually film, you know, elderly people having sex. But it was clear when one of the women are spending time with, uh, with visiting her husband of 30 years, whenever she visited him, he would take one of his new girlfriend's out. They'd go out for a meal and they went out as a threesome because he didn't remember that he was married to his wife. He thought he had a new girlfriend. And so, I mean, but I'm just taking that as an. So when I come to this question of why didn't the story about the, um, about, about the mixed martial arts workout, I think it was to do with like, there wasn't a great deal of angst there. It was kind of healthy and people just venting a little bit of male aggression. Hm. Does that make sense?

Speaker 3:          00:50:59       Yes. So I'm trying to give you the DNA of. We started out by talking about wackiness American culture, but the DNA for what I do is, is much more about the fundamental existential kind of the eras irresolvable Oh, my word. I don't know. Let's let it be a word like those sort of like those deep complex that we have as human beings from which are just bundled into the whole package of being human. Do you find it limiting in that you have to have conflict in order to have a story? Can you have a story where you're pursuing conflict and there no either. Like, to me the conflict, that's what I live for. I kinda thrive on, on experiencing conflict. I'm vicariously through the medium of reporting on the stories. Like I couldn't see a story like, did you see this film her? No, I did not, but I heard about it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:55       So a lot of people love that film. I got a lot of respect for Spike Jones, but I didn't get that film at all because there was no conflict in it. Uh, it, it was just like a love story, like a man falls in love with his, his operating system and then she, she kind of evolves to a higher consciousness and a breakup, but they're just having a lot of cozy. I sort of ruined it for fucking spoiled it man, but they kind of have a little cozy chats and I'm watching things like, okay, well I'm not getting, I don't. When's this going to start? And I think like, it maybe I'm programmed in a different way for some people because I could not watch that film and get white people what people were getting out of it. So you require conflict in order to be engaged? Yes. You must have it now. Well, I found one of the things that I've found really fascinating about your show was the episode on Indian Gurus. Yes. That was my favorite. Really. It's just so fucking bizarre. The American physicist was the most bizarre to me. There was a mike that was a long time, I guess Mike from California. Um, there, there was a Guy Swami, Swami Satchidananda, Swamiji love those names. Yeah. The Indians have fantastic language. Their names are amazing, but there was this character who is this a yoga master, spiritual

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       leader, whatever he is without judging. And there's this guy named Mike who was a Divo Tay who lived in this guy's Ostrom, I guess, and he believed that this man could materialize jewelry and objects and the story of him stomping his foot down and a 50 pound note appeared in his hand. Like, this guy's a fucking physicist. That's right. It's just so strange. That was a good one. It was my favorite, but my, one of my favorite moments was you sitting on the edge of the bed talking to him and you asked him whether or not you said try not to take this the wrong way, but did you have sadness in your life before you, before you met the sky?

Speaker 3:          00:54:13       And He, um, and he, he took it a myths and he didn't like that question. And um, he said something like, he said something like, uh, what I, are you asking me? I'm like, am I a burnout and burnout? And this quote was fascinating because it was about fundamentalism. Yeah. He says like, I always say that, uh, having a breakdown is the, is like the precursor to fundamentalism when I thought he was going to say that he had a break. Yeah. So I sort of went with the question, like what he said, I thought like he was setting me up for that, but he didn't see himself as a fundamentalist and I'm. It was a really, it was a misunderstanding. I normally try and get into the difficult questions a little more gracefully and because I've misunderstood what he was saying. I don't think you did.

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       I slid into it a bit. I really don't think you did. I think he changed gears, you think? Yeah, I think he was sort of happened. Like the deep story there is that I spent. That was weird weekends, days, which was about 10 years ago and I used to try and spend. It was like a little rule of thumb. I'd find a contributor who I could relate to the most. Like you take something that seemed really out of whack. Something that on the face of it you think that how could people really think it's cool to move to Idaho and not pay taxes and think the UN is going to invade. How could people really think that an Indian guru is going to manifest rolex watches? They call them cities by meditating and cure cancer by jamming on a keyboard. Right, and an old bon tempe keyboard and so.

Speaker 3:          00:55:45       But the. The. The technique we used was to try and find the most likable, reasonable seeming person who exemplified that belief system. So you was, you take a weird subject but cost it normal, like cast it a person who's likable and relatable and Mike was the guy we thought and when you found that guy and say, and I'll move it, I'll spend the night with them. It was like, it was like supposed to signal my commitment to the story as well. So in that story I spent the night at Mike's Ashram and um, but I, I, I, they had very thin mattresses, although I later found out there were different thicknesses depending on how committed you were, you would choose a thinner mattress so you can choose a thick when buying real. I just found a thin one so I put it on and I had one of the worst nights of sleep in my life and I woke up the next morning kind of groggy. And as you are offering night's sleep, not just going to have bad tempered, but also just my ci wasn't flowing right now. Wasn't in tune with what was going on around me. And so when he asked, he said something about if you're, you know, uh, if you fundamentalists because you've had a breakdown. And I think, oh, he's saying he had a breakdown. I think so did you have some sadness in your life? And then he, he, he,

Speaker 4:          00:56:54       let's play that and you can find that. You can find that Jamie, it's that video that you just showed if you back up about three or four minutes before that find it is, is you'll see louis getting out of bed and he looks very groggy and then he communicates with this guy and they have this

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       sort of a weird breakdown. It's also the one where I try and call because then the guru says he's a big fan of siegfried and Roy or David Copperfield. He says he went to Vegas and I took that as a kind of slightly very subtle coded possible admission that he takes an interest in magic and therefore what he does is it kind of conjuring. So I sort of, I was trying to edge towards getting him to admit that, you know, like we, we know that you can't make a Rolex watch appear out of thin air. Right. And so why not just, let's just get that out there and admit that you know, that's what you do. But he's a guru so he couldn't really admit it. Yeah. This is a

Speaker 5:          00:57:51       no, no, he doesn't. He's working on a cosmic level. Don't take this. Don't take this the wrong way. Mine who was there any sadness in your life before you came to see the Swami and committed to him? I've always have a little saying fundamentalism is the aftermath of a nervous breakdown when, you know, it's a little bit of course, but no. Did you ever break come up with that please? Yeah, no, I don't know. I like um, you know, the, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:58:39       she pauses all this, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, then he goes down. But I think these are all tells. I think he changed gears on you. I really think his statement, his initial statement, fundamentalism and, and you know about nervous breakdowns, I think that's what he's really saying. Yeah, I really do. And then when you confront him on it, he realizes he's on camera. That's why the all the, you know, you know, you know, he's thinking too much. He's trying to come up with a way to spin that story in a, in a better light. He's not just free flowing, what's going on in his mind. He's dancing around the subject trying to wrestle it into a more acceptable, palatable. I think

Speaker 3:          00:59:18       I created it, but I think what I see my take it is he, he's emotionally, you know, close to the surface and probably has been through a lot of difficult things. I, I mean, I mean I getting dangerously close to kind of diagnosing him, uh, in absentia. But uh, I, I, and I think, but I also think he's trying to step outside it. He's trying to say like, I agree with you like, but I'm not one of them. Like I don't think he thinks that he did have a breakdown. Well, it could be bought. He's trying to play it off. Yeah, I mean, I think maybe he was a lovely guy though. Uh, it was from the bay area. I hope he's doing okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:55       Okay. It seemed like a very nice guy, which is one of the interesting aspects of it. He also seemed fairly intelligent, but he also claimed to be a total complete scan

Speaker 3:          01:00:04       dick. But look, you know, Isaac, I mean I don't want to go on a little lecture, but Isaac Newton believed in Alchemy. Right? Did he? Yeah. And spent the last 20 years of his life having made probably the most important scientific breakthroughs of all time, the last 20 years of his life, kind of calculating the dimensions of Noah's Ark based on biblical information. I mean, just Wacko stuff and, and believed in the philosopher's stone and the idea of. I mean, so the, I, I'm constantly surprised and the ways in which your rationality or what we can choose to think of is rationality can coexist with rationality.

Speaker 1:          01:00:41       Sir Isaac Newton. Didn't he also have an issue with sexuality? I believe? I believe he was asexual.

Speaker 3:          01:00:48       The light that he was pretty weird. He was a pretty weird dude and then at the same time it may have taken someone with a certain credulity or, or like a willingness to believe in, you know, occult forces to come up with the notion of, of gravitational pull through a vacuum at a distance. You know, when, until then, you know, they'd been grappling with science as mechanistic, you know, in other words, don't say gravity. Nothing explains why gravity exists. Right. You know, why do objects attract one another at a distance through, through a vacuum. They just do like, there's no prior cause before that. So in a strange way, I'm, his mind may have been predisposed. Am I going to it?

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       No, no, you're not. And I don't think there's anything. I mean, obviously he's not, I don't believe he's correct about Alchemy, but I think you're dealing with a time when information was so limited that he might have thought that he was onto something the same way he was on the gravity. He might have thought that there was some sort of a scientific basis to alchemy that he just couldn't hunt down.

Speaker 3:          01:01:56       Well, exactly. And I think that's what I'm trying to say, and at that time, the paradigm of science in the 17th century was that I'm all that nonsense that they used to believe in the Middle Ages was nonsense, that you didn't have an even Aristotelian ideas of things going up and everything could be explained mechanistically. It was a mechanistic that objects banged into each other and that's why things moved. So

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       it took a leap of faith to say, you know what, maybe objects move each other are through forces that are invisible and can't really be explained well. It's also important to note that most scientists were religious back then, guess most scientists were Christians. It was a, there was a or Islamic, um, it was very common to be a Christian. Very, very uncommon to be an atheist. Yeah. In fact, anyone espousing atheistic ideas was thought to be a fucking nut. Which is really interesting today where you look at the vast majority of scientists, you know, huge percentage of them either are agnostic or claim to be atheists. You know, I think it would be comparable to saying nowadays saying I'm a pedophile, you know, I think actually being an atheist in the 17th century was so outside the norm of what people considered acceptable or it was. I mean, I think that's the only way we could get our brains around thinking you would be shunned. People would look at you and think like, what is wrong with you? You know, because it was just taken for granted, uh, in, in, in all levels of acceptable society. Well, I,

Speaker 1:          01:03:28       it's really interesting just going back into our past just recent past, so we have with recordings and television and watching how different our culture is from today, say from the 19 twenties and 19 thirties. Even films from the, you know, the 19 forties and fifties, they're, they very. So there's so much of a difference. I'm a standup comedian and when I go back and I listened to the standup Comedians of the 19 fifties in the 19 sixties, I mean, it's incredible how much different culture is between now and then. The greatest, probably the most important comedian ever is lenny. Bruce, in my opinion, but if you try to listen to Lenny Bruce today, it's really not funny. No, it's not. It's not funny and it's almost blast for me to say, but it's, it's true because our culture has changed so much since then that it's just not relevant anymore. The things that he's saying and the way he sang them, the, the, the humor, the shockingness of it. Then it's so normal today.

Speaker 4:          01:04:29       Do you find any old, like do you find the Marx brothers funny or chaplain or there's some physical comedy that's still pretty funny. Okay. But if it was new it would suck. You know what I mean? If it was released today, if someone tried to release a three stooges movie today, be like, what a piece of shit and that's a person, you know, I have great respect for the three stooges. Sounds crazy

Speaker 1:          01:04:52       decide, but I, I think that it's, it's, it's an evidence of the references. Our culture is just extremely different now and I think that's one of the more challenging aspects of trying to look back on the 16 hundreds and trying to imagine what life was like trying to go back to the days when they used to have to put skirts on table legs because were thinking that people are going to be sexually attracted to a table, legs and piano and it's hard for people to imagine that that was a real thing.

Speaker 3:          01:05:25       What about thinking of 100 years in the future and what will look back on now as a culturally weird that we take for granted? Oh, there'll be so much. There'll be so much. What would it be? Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:05:38       massive amounts of contradictions that we have in our society. I mean, I think first of all, the way people dress, be bizarre. Women's high heels will be laughed at women's high heels. Like when you see women walk around with spikes, you know, and when women love wearing stilettos and pumps and all these really bizarre feet distorting shoewear or footwear, I mean, I think that's one of the things it's going to be looked back upon ties. People look back on ties the way they looked at powdered wigs from the, uh, you know, George Washington era.

Speaker 3:          01:06:11       So strange. I mean, uh, and racism was normal in the 19th century. And even someone like Lincoln who we think of as being a hero of the civil rights struggle, you know, freeing the slaves, the emancipation proclamation made a number of deeply racist statements, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:06:28       Yeah. The world was different. The way they looked at the world was very, very, very different.

Speaker 3:          01:06:34       And have you followed the whole story in Britain about show business celebrities being a accused of sex crimes based on behavior in the 19 seventies?

Speaker 1:          01:06:46       Did I followed that whole thing about that one guy who was that famous talk show host Jimmy Savile? Yes. Wow. That is fucking crazy. That guy was a pedophile and apparently for decades and it was covered up much like the Jerry Sandusky case in America for a lot of folks are aware of that. The Pennsylvania State, uh, the guy who is a coach football coach who was just a massive pedophile and they covered it up, they covered it up so much, so I don't know if you're familiar with that case, but the DA, the guy who was the prosecutor was trying to try to find out information. He turned up missing. He turned up missing and they found his laptop and a river with no hard drive. They killed that fucking guy. They killed the guy that is investigating Jerry Sandusky. Someone did. And he would go, well, why would someone do that when you're talking about a pedophile? But then you find out how much money the school makes and the school makes from their football program the school makes from people who went to that school who donate to the school. And it's an insane amount of money. It's hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.

Speaker 3:          01:07:51       But did you know that I was the only person who, uh, who lived with Jimmy savile on it's on and off for two weeks and made a documentary about him? No, in 2000 you could find that on, on Youtube. What was that like? Well, let's see. It's been a, it's been a matter of a lot of soul searching for me because of the, um, because of the strangeness of them discovering that he had track record of, of apparently sexually abusing where you that keen and excited. I'm like, goodness, just, he's talking and it just appears. Wow. So go ahead place on the difference between us. We should be able to do something. When Louis met Jimmy, so you, you spent two weeks with that guy? More or less? Yeah, off and on over the, over about three, three or four months of miserable Americans who were not aware of the story at all.

Speaker 3:          01:08:44       It's not a very popular story. Explain who he is. So he, there's no exact cultural figure in America to compare him with. But he was mainly known as, as a DJ and from the late sixties, right through to the nineties, he was a, he was just on the radio a lot and then he got a TV show on the back of his Dj career where it was called Jibo fix it and people would call in with requests for special fixits, which were dreams that he would make come true for them. So kids would say I've always wanted to a box with a big bulk, you know, meet Mohammed Ali or, or drive a Ferrari or um, whatever it was, a dance with shorty know, like just, and they would come on and he would fix it for them to do the things that was a very popular mainstream TV show for 20 years.

Speaker 3:          01:09:34       And I'm all to. Everyone in Britain knew who he was and he was very, very in his appearance was very odd. You know, you could see him there, but even more so in his younger years, he had this helmet of hair. And so you, you always looked at him and thought cottage, he looks really hard, like something not right about him. But at the same time he became a knight, he was very well as a, the establishment. He, uh, became a night. Yeah, he was knighted for any raised millions and millions of dollars for a pounds for charity. So he like this unique cultural figure. And then after he died, it turned out that he had sexually assaulted a number of, of women and um, many of them were under age. So it was a women thing. I thought it was boys as well. Well, there's that that's been alleged and I don't know, you know, with all this stuff, the truth is, it's not kind of been completely established because he hasn't been know he's dead.

Speaker 3:          01:10:30       He can't be tried in court. But some men have stepped forward and said that they were abused by him when they were children. So it was all children, boys and girls. When you say it was some of them, some of the people who who said they were assaulted, they said it happened when they were in their thirties, twenties. And then if he had a victim profile, it seems to have been younger teens. Oh Wow. Anyway, so that's a whole other can of worms, but I just, since you mentioned it, I, I felt I should, I should say you, I mentioned that had a connection. So what was your experience when you were with them for two weeks? Well, there was a scene in the scene. We should play this bit of today.

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       I, uh, you, you don't bother with anybody else, et cetera. No, never,

Speaker 3:          01:11:22       never know. Even for like a week.

Speaker 4:          01:11:25       Nope, not even probation. So he's saying he never had a girlfriend go me meaning he wants to fuck other people and he says don't bother with anybody else

Speaker 3:          01:11:34       basically. That's what he's saying. He's saying that I've never had a girlfriend. I've only, I've only kind of flitted from girl to go. He says friends that are girls, thousands of them, but girlfriend. No. And he's like 70 there. Yeah. But. So I didn't really even at that time I didn't. I mean, you, you decoded that straight away. At the time I wasn't really sure exactly what he was saying. Really? Yeah. Because I think because like he'd been so confusing and he said so many different things about the nature, I mean he'd been so evasive on the subject and if, uh, but yeah, absolutely. He's saying now that he had lots of different girls who he would sleep with,

Speaker 4:          01:12:17       so this, but this line of conversation leads me to believe that you were suspicious about him that

Speaker 3:          01:12:23       knew that it was well known that, um, let's say it was well known that it, that his interests were unclear. Like in other words, it was well known. There was a mystery. I would say that no one ever. If people always say like, what are his interest? I don't understand. He's never had a girlfriend or a wife or you know, maybe he's gay or maybe he is. Maybe he celebrate. Maybe he's a sexual. And I'm. So I knew that there was a blank spot, like a gray area space where, you know, his, his, he kept his sexuality kind of. Um, and if you questioned him on it, it was, it was clear there was a secret. And I didn't quite know what. I didn't know what the secret was and there were rumors of him being attracted to underage, underage girls. Was one of the rumors.

Speaker 4:          01:13:10       Wow. So this is not something that just dropped after he died. This was something that was, was it because of the fact that he did so much charitable work? Was it difficult to question him because the fact that he was knighted that

Speaker 3:          01:13:24       for me, like I never felt inhibited from, from asking tough questions.

Speaker 4:          01:13:28       Well, you wouldn't know that's your nature was culture where they. I'll

Speaker 3:          01:13:33       truly, I think, um, what's emerging now is that there was an atmosphere of, of protection. I don't think there was, there wasn't like a memo that went out saying don't touch him. He does a lot of work for charity. But there was a, there was an atmosphere of a feeling that he was um, uh, doing good works for charity and he was a vip. And you know, I think abuse victims, even when it's not a celebrity, there's a lot of pressure on them not to come forward due to embarrassment and a misplaced sense of guilt. And when it's a

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       prominent member of, of, of the celebrity world who's viewed as a kind of, um, uh, you know, a benevolent, a philanthropist, you know, even more so, yeah, that was the issue with Sandusky as well, that he worked in charities, charitable organizations that helped a lot of young kids that were orphans and he took a lot of these young kids on trips and this was apparently when he had sexually molested them, allegedly. What have you. I don't know if he's ever admitted to any of this, but of course he's obviously he's guilty of something. Um, but that was his thing that he had helped all these kids and he was involved in all these charitable organizations, but there was suspicions about him and there was stories about him for a long time and someone had protected him. And the idea is the reason why they had protected him was because it would take down penn state this enormous, a money making machine.

Speaker 4:          01:15:10       This huge cultural. Uh, it was, it was a huge business. And it was also like a big part of the community. I mean, Penn State is this institution, this, this established institution that would be brought down by this and victims had come forward. Yes. And gone to the police or, or, or gone to the university authorities authority. It's a good question. Um, my friend Dom I rera is actually friends with the prosecutor, the, the one who chased him down at the end, not the guy that turned up missing, but one of the ones who was involved at the very end when he did wind up getting prosecuted. That guy, he's amazing. He's in jail now, right? Who Sent Dusky? Yeah, he's in jail. Yeah. The whole thing is very disgusting, but it's, it's so disturbing to think that they protected him. Like that was the whole thing about this joe paternal character who was the, the much was the legendary coach, legendary coach who knew what was going on.

Speaker 4:          01:16:11       Allegedly. Yes. Yeah. Allegedly knew, know, and he took early retirement. He died very quickly afterwards too. Yeah. I mean, I think the news was just absolutely devastating. And when he was, I don't think he took early retirement. I believe he was removed. I believe he was removed as a coach and that's when everybody went crazy. I mean, there was like riots when they removed him as the coach and then the news came out and then when the news came out everybody was like, oh fuck. And then he died shortly afterwards and I, I would probably safely say that a good reason why he died was not just old age. That devastating effect of this all becoming public was probably just unbelievably hard to deal with. Of course, you know, not minimizing what happened to those kids is much more difficult for them to deal with it. It's the whole thing is just totally disgusting, but fascinating in some sort of a strange, bizarre way that human beings are capable of doing something like that, that they're capable of shielding this monster.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       It is. Yeah. It really is. And so, uh, uh, but I'm curious about the fact that you enjoyed the, the guru story. Uh, I, I, because I look back at that and it's not one that I would feel is kind of one of my finest moments. I loved it.

Speaker 4:          01:17:29       I love the part where you met the woman who is this guy or this female guru, and she hugged me

Speaker 3:          01:17:35       right? And I had a sort of transcendental experience. What happened there? What was that? Um, it's hard to explain, but I, you know, sometimes I think, you know, in a male way, I'm not that connected to like the deepest sources of my, of my emotion, so I don't really know what it was, but I do think that being hogged is a very simple and it's a physical act, but it's, uh, it, it, it creates all kinds of emotions inside of you. And it just sort of welled up from nowhere. It was just really odd. I don't really know exactly what happened.

Speaker 4:          01:18:10       Um, I thought about that quite a bit after I watched it. And one of the things that I took from it was the emotions and just the whole group of people waiting in line to hug someone. The anticipation of it and the love that's in the air. There's sort of this group minded thing that's going on

Speaker 3:          01:18:27       and there's a lot of music, loud music. There's a lot of people around, there's a, there's a, there's a very heightened atmosphere and then she gave me a sort of turbo hug too, like she gave me the executive platinum card hug and I think they whispered to her like, give this guy the works. And um, so she hugged me for longer and she was actually muttering things into my ear. What was she saying? Not Words that I recognize, but it was like, it was sort of like, um, so it was, is it comforting noises? That's the word. Poon job is the word for their language, right? Well, there's several languages spoken Hindi or I'm this or there's a few others, too many to mention.

Speaker 4:          01:19:16       I would think that just the experience itself of being around all those people that were in this sort of dancing joyous state in this long line to get to this woman and she probably had some sincere loving gesture towards everyone as well. I mean, you imagine what it would be like to be adored by so many people in such a large group of people that are established there to come see you and get in line to hug you or then you did it and. But you are really like movies.

Speaker 3:          01:19:45       I was, yeah. I mean I think as well I was under a lot of pressure when I'm doing those stories. I feel very pent up and I'm aware that I have one chance to kind of get the thing that I'm trying to get and we. It was one of those classic things where I was supposed to hug her the day before and then we took a crew break and went for an Indian meal and then when arrived at the hugging tent that packed up and left and I was like, Oh my God, we missed the hug and then it turned out she was doing two nights. She was doing like two dates in that city because she was on tour, like hugging her way around India. So I was like, oh, we're fucked out. We can get the hug now just because like our crew wanted a nice meal and, and, um, uh, and so I got to here another night, so it was, it was this long lead up to getting the hug. It's always a tightly wound coil of, of anxiety. So when I finally got there and had the hug, it was a several levels on which I felt just sort of relieved.

Speaker 1:          01:20:44       Wow, that's fascinating. That's fascinating.

Speaker 3:          01:20:47       But you know, religions, you know, it's one of life's life's mysteries and um, I'm trying to do a thing on scientology at the moment and that's proven quite, quite a difficult road.

Speaker 1:          01:21:00       Well, religion is certainly, it certainly is one of life's great mysteries, but I think there, there's also group states have like mindedness that I find quite fascinating and you could get them when the people. I was at a military base once it was a UFC fight for the troops and uh, they sang the national anthem. It's in the middle of the Iraq war. And um, the, the, the, when they sang the national anthem, the intensity and the feeling in the air, the patriotism, the, the, just the emotions involved in you're dealing with thousands of people in the audience who have lost loved ones, lost friends, maybe been wounded themselves, may be taken lives themselves. Many of them have shore taken lives themselves. And the, the, the palpable, the patriotism and the emotion and the environment. I am a person who was absolutely against all of these wars, whether it's the Iraq invasion, the Afghanistan war.

Speaker 1:          01:22:01       I thought the whole thing was about money. And the whole thing was ill advised. I thought that the idea of going in for these supposed weapons of mass destruction was incredibly transparent. And then I thought that the government and the military industrial complex was capitalizing on a horrible event in September 11th. And using that as an impetus to go and invade these countries and, and take over, you know, resources. But that moment when that thing was happening and that person was singing the national anthem was a soldier that was singing the national anthem and everyone was standing there proud. And the energy in the air and they cheer when it was over ready to go to war. I mean, you are ready to support the troops. You're ready to not just support the troops but support the war. You're ready to, to back them. I mean, there's this weird thing that happens. These group minded sort of states that.

Speaker 3:          01:22:57       So did you get into a kind of altered consciousness in that moment? I felt something for sure. Did you feel I could have easily if I, if I

Speaker 4:          01:23:05       coached myself into it or if I entertain those thoughts, let it go. If you'd gone with the feeling. I mean, I was working at the time I was, it was, you know, I was there for the ultimate fighting championship and um, but the state of mind, the, the group state was fucking intense and it was, it was palpable. It was tangible. It was in the air. And you know, this is coming from a person who I believe that it's very important to have military. I believe that there are bad people in the world. I believe that there's sometimes no other solutions mean I don't believe in pacifism when you're dealing with thugs and evil people in the world. I believe that, but I also believe that there's good people that are sent into bad situations for all the wrong reasons, by people that are trying to make money in that state, in that state, with being there with all those soldiers, being there with those people. Man, you got swept away by it. He just carried away by this, this intense feeling of patriotism. It's an indescribable because you could feel the emotions of those people that are in that room and I wonder if that's similar to what you were experiencing when you were there.

Speaker 6:          01:24:22       I'm sure. I'm sure we're very close and, and, and it's not the only time when. I mean if the only time I think I felt that exact sort of emotion of sort of whatever that was as a religious transcendence, but I've, you know, there's plenty of times when you are around people. I mean, in a way, a lot of the stories I do are about the altered consciousness of being exposed to people who believe things passionately and the slight sense of Stockholm Syndrome that sets in when you were there for prolonged periods, you know, and, and, and the weird, um, change the, the change in consciousness that takes place. You know, I, I did a story where I was with the Phelps clan, the Westboro Baptist Church, and uh, I was spent three weeks with them if I did two different things, but for the first one, I was there for three, which was called the most hated family in America. And it was really odd because when you're inside there, the little compound in their, in their castle imbibing they're at and their doctrine round the clock, stuff that seems really weird and hateful on the outside starts to seem mundane. You know, you're still able to step outside of their life. I'm here to do a job and this is wrong, but you, you get a nice sized, your mind, your mind starts to get influenced. It's really strange.

Speaker 4:          01:25:40       I would imagine it is. Um, I've found the Phelps won very fascinating because of the one guy that came there to film a documentary on them and then became one of them.

Speaker 6:          01:25:51       He joined up. Steve. Yeah, he's very high up there now. Steve. He's and his daughter left, um, a couple of years ago we went back and did a followup because a couple, the people we featured in the first one then left. But Steve almost you could argue by dint of having been born outside the church was compensating by being even more hardcore because he was the fiercest and the most, um, in conversation. He was the hardest and the most, um, the most abusive, I guess most verbally

Speaker 4:          01:26:27       full of bile. And he also, when you questioned anything that he was saying, what starting salting you. Yeah. Yeah. And aggressively insulting you. And I found that fascinating as well. Wasn't just that you could have questions. It was, what are you fucking idiot? It was immediately this aggressive sort of

Speaker 6:          01:26:45       told me I was the most. I can't remember the phrase that it sounds like the most iniquitous or the most evil man in the history of the earth or one of the three most evil men. He said, you're right up there with punches pilot like I was one of the three most evil men of all time, like way beyond Hitler. And the reason was the reason was because I'd been exposed to the teaching, so like I'd been given a special opportunity like I was blessed beyond measure because I had been exposed for three weeks to the pure teachings of the only people preaching salvation on earth and having seen that and still rejected it, then that put me way beyond the Pale.

Speaker 4:          01:27:31       I found it incredibly fascinating. How effective of a guy who sucks at speaking is at running a call, like he's a terrible orator. He's not like this really charismatic

Speaker 6:          01:27:43       gramps. The main guy. He's very old now. He's in his time. He could. He could do it. I thought he was. I think you're being a little unfair real. You remember the bit where he says, I'm going to eat. You're going to eat your babies. Like he, he still, he's very old and decrepit, but he still cranks it up and he goes, you're gonna, eat your babies.

Speaker 4:          01:28:04       See, I don't agree. I felt it was so one note, it was like death metal. You can eat your baby. I mean, it was just so obvious. It's just there. There's. Who Do you like, you like Billy Graham? Like what preaching style do you prefer? A Sam Kennison. It's my favorite. Um, I just think that there are people who are better at it than Phelps. Phelps is so negative and so abrasive. I think there's almost his. He's so evil.

Speaker 6:          01:28:35       Bill, he starts dearly beloved. He has a slow bill and then he ramps it up and then he get, he hits his, his kind of power chorus. If you can eat your babies,

Speaker 4:          01:28:46       I think there's something when someone's unbelievably evil and aggressive where you don't want them to be angry at you, so you're willing to sort of like bend your mind to what they're saying and accept it and allow it in. And that's what I felt watching that guy. And I've seen that in him before and in his speeches, I've tried to sort of rationalize or understand what's going on when, when he talks, why would anybody gets sucked into all this evil, hateful talk and not question it, but I think it's, he's so over the top and so aggressive that he's frightening to people, like when you sat down with them. And

Speaker 6:          01:29:21       here's the thing, they, I mean by and large, they don't really make converts. They make a few, but he's not trying to recruit new personnel. If anything, it's the opposite. They re, they view it as a, um, as a confirmation of the holy status of their salvation that they rejected because there's some verse somewhere in the Bible saying, you will be hated of men and people will throw things at you. It's somewhere in the Bible. And so every time someone says, you're full of it, you're scum. We hate you. That what they hear is, yes, we are. We're saved. So, and so when he, um, and so, like 90 percent of the people in there were born into it and a family members. And in fact, they lose, they hemorrhage membership constantly. They kicked people out. So when he's preaching, he's not thinking, how do I get new new followers?

Speaker 6:          01:30:15       While I'm not saying that he's thinking that, I'm wondering the effectiveness of retaining anyone. I don't think it's even there. I guess there is a, the, the main effectiveness is that, um, I don't know what it. Well, you would know obviously much more than I, you were there for three weeks deeply embedded into that organization. He hated me. GRANDPA did. And he was one of the few times where you try and do an interview with someone who clearly can't stand you. And I did an. I said something like, how can you really believe that there's no. Like, even if you accept that what you say is true, you know that position is, there's no other church in the world that is preaching the doctrine. I said, how would you even know? Like there could be some tiny church in Nigeria that's preaching the exact same message. How would you, you wouldn't even know. He goes and he says, I didn't know about them. And I asked another question you guys asked and answered and I also have another because asked an answer and he just kept saying Austin answered, which is a legal term and you know, what do you do what you do then? Well there's nothing you could chuck. He's the epitome of a close minded person. He is

Speaker 4:          01:31:25       closed minded. Not just that, but this arrogant assumption that he's the man with the word of God and that it comes out of this angry old fuckheads face. You know, it's, it's a, it's an amazing thing that this guy is able to put together this group. I mean I just. This is the moment where you sat down and talked to this guy. You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:31:45       How long have you been with him by then? I think this was, I'm trying to think. It was the end of it. We made three trips each of a week. This was the second trip last day.

Speaker 4:          01:31:56       Just a little knowledge of what you just said is stupidity

Speaker 5:          01:32:01       in Spanish. I don't know how to deal with questions like that. Just you just took dom. Sorry, W you're, you've got the duty to know the Bible as well as I can. Why? Because you are a human being because God Almighty major and got all my is going to send you to hell. Is it accurate to say that you regard the Westboro Baptist church is the only biblical preaching? Just three minutes of answering your question is yes. No, it was five minutes. Well, but I already talked to them. So there's three left. He even had a laugh. Their fucking shitty math preaching that is according to the word of God. It's been asked and answered my next question as far as your concerned.

Speaker 6:          01:32:48       We got it. Yeah. I mean this is angry old shitty man who's able to get a bunch of people to listen to him. I finally gets his kids, his kids and his grandkids know how many people were there. It seems like there was 20 or 30 or 90. That's good. Yeah, he had 11 year. I think I want to get this right. I think it was like 12 kids, but for them had left the church and um, and each of them had, had quite a few kids, but I think, um, I think if you're an EGOMANIAC number one, number two, if whatever reason you cleave to a certain kind of dogmatic religious outlook, it's probably not that difficult to, to, to run, to have a cult. It's unfortunate, but I think you're right, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:33:37       shocking. But I think you're right, I've, I've often said that all you have to do is speak confidently and clearly and most people will be like, I can't.

Speaker 6:          01:33:44       Yeah. And, and have no compunction about saying that you speak the word of God or whatever it is. It's really all you have to

Speaker 1:          01:33:50       do, right? You have to be the guy with the answers. You have to be the guy that absolutely not just the is like as a human, but the answer is from above.

Speaker 6:          01:33:57       Have you read the new medicine book than you Charles Manson Book by Jeff Gwinnett came out last year? No, I try not to read anything that comes out about Manson A. Oh, well I'll ask you why in a second, but when you read it, it's like, Oh my word. You just have to be kind of come out with a few kind of riddles that you've learned from St Pimps and people fall into your lap or so it would seem.

Speaker 1:          01:34:20       You made me hate your garbage, man. You people made me. I'm your product. All that fucking shit. I think that that guy's the Bob hope of serial killers, you know, because Bob hope was a comedian that never really made anybody that in my generation laugh. Like we always knew him as a comedian, but it's just really wasn't funny. Manson's never scary to me. Like there's some real serial killers that we're fucking terrifying. But when you think of serial killers, it's always Manson Manson Manson is the guy, the crazy guy, the wild guy because he carved fucking swastika on his head. But if you mean Henry Lee Lucas, the guy from that, they made that movie about him. Henry Portrait of a serial killer allegedly killed somewhere around 60 people. You know, and I, I,

Speaker 6:          01:35:09       with Manson, the. I think the reason people are fascinated with medicine is because he didn't kill,

Speaker 1:          01:35:14       right? He got other people too because he got the children that he, uh, he sent them out. Tex Watson was as big killer, right? Become a born again Christian and I think he writes children's books or something fucking creepy

Speaker 6:          01:35:28       that. And you know, a number of them still believe, you know, that trial is that Charlie's still.

Speaker 1:          01:35:34       Yeah, of course. Otherwise they're idiots. Then they're fucked up and you know, well, what he did, what they did do to Sharon tate, tate labianca murders, fucking unbelievably horrific and caught a baby out of her body and a lot all over the walls. And it was all really, really terrifying shit. I mean, don't get me wrong, but there's been a series of really, really evil people that almost no one knows about and it's bizarre what becomes popular, what becomes famous in the world of evil people you know. And sometimes it's just a name, you know, Manson, you know, and everybody remembers that name. They, they're too lazy to kind of investigate and find out about other names. But there's been a, you know, so many God damn serial killers in this country or have been. It's bizarre that that one guy gets so much ink.

Speaker 6:          01:36:28       Yeah. Well Geraldo can take his share of responsibility because for all those fault. Well he did a number of landmark interviews in the, I guess in the seventies or the early eighties. You can see them on youtube where he sort of turned him into a celebrity. I mean, I guess the, the, the cases were big at the time, but then he, Geraldo did some shows. I think Diane Sawyer might've done an interview and then they passed laws to say that you couldn't basically, you couldn't interview Charles Manson anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:36:58       It's fascinating to see what Geraldo has become. Did you know that Geraldo was like a counterculture figure at one time Geraldo was the guy who introduced the world to the Zapruder film. He had Dick Gregory on his television show and he showed the world as uproot or film essentially establishing the idea that it was more than one person or someone else other than Lee Harvey Oswald that killed Kennedy. Now he's on Fox News. And what happened to Dick Gregory? Dick Gregory is still around. He's, you know, he's not really a comedian anymore. I think he does some shows, but he's more of an activist and he's a very, very old now. But I saw something recently with Dick Gregory sitting down with Paul Mooney who is a, um, a great old comedian from Los Angeles who was a writer for Richard Pryor and just a great comedian. And the two of them were sitting around talking about racism and culture.

Speaker 6:          01:37:51       Some of his jokes back in the day were pretty good.

Speaker 1:          01:37:53       Very good. Dick Gregory was very good, but he was

Speaker 4:          01:37:55       also not just a comedian, you know, he was an activist. He was the guy who somehow or another got ahold of the Zapruder film. The zapruder film was made obviously in 1963 when Kennedy was assassinated, but it was put on. It was bought by time life magazine, I believe, by whoever owns life magazine or time at the time. And they just put it on shelf for, for years. And 19 seventies is when Geraldo had it on a show. So before that it had never been ed never. They just made a TV show about it. I think about the router family. Yeah. I think. Look at this, look at the way they're dressed.

Speaker 7:          01:38:35       Right. Straight out that if you 75. So think about that. Eight years later, a crazy little queasy then don't watch this film. Just put on the uh, the late night movie, uh, because this is a very heavy. It's the film shot by the Dallas dress manufacturer. 70 five Zapruder and it's the execution of President Kennedy Way. Geraldo has a mustache. What we're seeing as we show this film bruter film. Okay. So the cars are coming along now into dealey plaza. Yes. These are the lead motorcycles in the motorcade. All right. Now with the president and Mrs Kennedy is also governor connally right now. Before he goes behind the sign, the president is waving to the crowd when it comes out from behind the sign, he is shot. Then governor connally, his shot. He's already been hit. He's already been hit. And now at the bottom of the screen, the head shot, that's the shot that blew off his head. It's the most horrifying thing I've ever seen in the movies. Now the Warren Commission said that all of the shots were fired from behind by Lee Harvey Oswald alone, assassin firing at the president. And then she could see clearly the head is thrown violently backwards, can completely consistent with the shot from the front. Right now, this is an extreme blob of just the president from the film coming out behind the sign. He shot his head from the sit here in the front from the front. Now Jackie doesn't realize what's happened yet. She goes to his aid

Speaker 8:          01:40:07       and now

Speaker 7:          01:40:12       he's said again, the violent backward motion.

Speaker 4:          01:40:15       I've never seen that before with really never seen this uprooted from a, just like the bits they showed in jfk, you know, the Oliver Stone Film. Uh, I'd never, I'd never seen. I don't think they showed that bit. I don't know. I mean, it's, it's pretty common. It's, it's available. I mean, they've broken it down. It's been enhanced. There's a variety that you believe in. The, uh, there were two gunman. I think there was probably more than two. Garmin. Yeah, I think, but I don't think. I don't think it's an either or was one of the Woody Harrelson's dad. It very well could have been. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that fascinating? Well, I don't think it was an either or because everybody wants to say that he was either

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       Lee Harvey Oswald or it was other people. It could have been Lee Harvey Oswald and other people, and that's. I don't understand why people have to have everything black and white and everyone's Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Like, why do you think that? Why do you think that? Like why would anybody think that he acted alone? If you look at all the injuries that Kennedy was Bonnie, first of all, the shot in the neck. It's an entry wound in Bethesda, Maryland. They called it a tracheotomy, but in Dallas, fort worth when he was first administered by taking care of my doctors, they said it was an entry wound. They changed what the wound in his neck was in order to fit with the established narrative of Lee Harvey Oswald being the lone shooter. That's one reason to think that there was more than one person. The other reason to think there was more than one person was the single bullet theory, and I've heard a lot of people say that the single bullet theory could have happened.

Speaker 1:          01:41:45       That bullets can act very weird when they go through and they absolutely can't. People have shot people and bullets shot someone from the front and the bullet has ricocheted inside their head and come out there. I and landed in front. I mean that has happened, but let's take very strange past when they ricochet off bones. That's not what's weird about the bullet passing through to people. What's weird about the bullet passing through to people is first of all, why did they think that one bullet did that and the reason for that is because a bullet hit, the underpass ricocheted off a curb stone and hurt some person that was standing in the underpass. So they had to attribute one of the shots. One of the three shots to that bullet, they knew that Kennedy and connally had both been hit and then they knew that there was a headshot, so those are three bullets, one boat that hit the curb stone, the other boat that passed through two bodies, and then the headshot.

Speaker 1:          01:42:35       That's the reason why they had to make the entry wound of the neck a tracheotomy and that's the reason why they had to say that one bullet had caused these wounds on two different people. They found the bullet on the Gurney in Connolly's hospital, Gurney when he was administered in the hospital. Oh look, we found a bullet in pristine condition if you've ever shot a bullet, and that bullets hit bone. When bullets hit bone, they distort the idea that that bullet came out like that. After going through two people's bodies and hitting bone. It's ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense. That's the reason why I think that more than one person was involved and that's the reason why there's a book called best evidence by a guy named David Lifton who goes into great detail. He was a. He was a bookkeeper and an accountant and uh, he, he had some assignment revolving involving the Warren Commission and he was such a meticulous guy that he actually read the entire Warren Commission, which is some insane number of pages, but he read it and he wrote a book called best evidence all about all the contradictions in the Warren Commission report and why he thought that the entire thing was established to make a, a, a predetermined conclusion and to establish that with the American public.

Speaker 1:          01:43:49       And he thought it was all horse shit. So I don't think so. I think more than one person was involved, but it could have been Lee Harvey Oswald to. That's what people don't understand. Why people have to have either Lee Harvey Oswald killed them or there was other people like it has to be there alone. Assassin or other people. I think the Harvey Oswald clearly was a fucked up guy who had some sort of a connection to the government. He went to Russia, lived in Russia, and then came back to the United States, got a passport until he was living in Russia and then was readmitted back into the United States and had some dubious connections to the, uh, to, to the, to the world of, of, of government. It was a very strange, strange story that in this day and age, you know, all these years later, we're most likely never going to get the full.

Speaker 6:          01:44:36       How many impacts do you see in that video?

Speaker 1:          01:44:39       It's hard to say. You know, when Kennedy is holding his body like this, most likely he's. He had been hit, but they're saying that it was from the front. How do you know it was from the front? It was from the, behind the sign. He could've been hit from the back. It's hard to tell what happened. Me, he's going like this. You're assuming that that's because he was hit, but it might not have been. I mean, he might've dropped his fucking pen. I mean, he might've been like, where's my shit? And then got hit in the head. I don't know. I don't know. It's very difficult to tell from that video how many times he's been hit, but the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone seems the least likely of those of the scenarios, and then the photos of the Howard hunt who was arrested allegedly along with a bunch of people that were quote Unquote Hobos, that they ended up arrested behind the behind the grassy knoll, but then they were all released.

Speaker 1:          01:45:33       Their hobos were, they were dressed normal, their address, like, you know, regular people. And then you know, Woody Harrelson, his dad who was a known murderer who supposedly has some sort of a connection to it. I don't know. You know, I don't know, but you know, there's a guy who wanted to get rid of the Federal Reserve. There was a guy who wanted to get rid of the CIA. He wanted to pull out of Vietnam. I mean, there's a lot of shit that Kennedy wanted. He wanted to put us. He put us out of Vietnam. He wanted to disrupt the military industrial complex. He wanted to do a lot of things that were very unpopular.

Speaker 6:          01:46:07       I mean, in a way you could pose the question is not why would he have been assassinated, but why aren't more president's assassinated? We'll look at a guy like Obama who, it's amazing to me that given the level of vitriol that's directed at him from quarters, you know, in the far right that someone. But I think every day there are threats and probably some of them are credible threats against him. Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:46:31       I'm sure that CIA or the rather the secret service does a great job of stopping a lot of assassination attempts. I mean, if we lived in a time like, you know, during the Lincoln administration, whether there's. Everything was very just, you know, they just didn't have the type of security that they have today. They didn't have this sort of technology. The ability to track people, the ability to keep an eye on questionable

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       folks

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       did. Uh, did you follow one of the guys they questioned in connection with threats to the president was Ted Nugent, did you know that question with? He was actually for statements that he'd made about Obama. He got a, he got a visit from the secret service.

Speaker 4:          01:47:05       Yeah. He said that he would wind up in jail if, if Obama was elected again, you know, that he would wind up in jail.

Speaker 6:          01:47:12       Well, and that was construed as a threat to them because I made a program about. Here's another guy. I did it when I started out working in TV with Michael Moore. Uh, he gave me my break on tv and I worked on a show called TV nation and one of the early segments was with Ted nugent. I've always had a sort of fascination with the far right.

Speaker 4:          01:47:32       Yeah. He's a very fascinating guy. And the FARC row on the far right because there's been so much bizarre shit in his past. He had adopted some 17 year old girl or became a legal custody. Took legal custody of her so we could have sex with her. Is that rights as parents allowed it or her parents maybe or 11? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:47:52       It said in a recent New York Times story that he had admitted to having, um, I guess unlawful, a relationship. Sexual relations with underage girls. Underage girl. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:48:03       Goals. Does that ring a bell? There was something that Courtney love said that she gave him a blowjob and she was 12. Really am. Yeah. Apparently allegedly A. Yeah. He's a fascinating character. You know, he's a radical far right, sort of a guy, but what he said about Obama was clearly a joke, but you can't have jokes about Obama. Like we had a guy on

Speaker 6:          01:48:27       that was a joke as much as just A. I'm a racist, insult, racist. When he said, well, this was a different occasion. This was when he called him a subhuman Mongrel.

Speaker 4:          01:48:39       Oh, okay. Yeah. Well that's not what we're talking about. I don't think that was the reason why he got up with the visit. Yeah. I'm sorry, I switched the subject. It was more recently in the news because of this comment. Yeah. The visit was before the reelection instead of Obama got in office again. He would wind up being arrested. That was, I'm sure that was a CIA visited him and I think he was just talking shit, you know, I think he just talks a lot. He does an incredible amount of media. I'm pretty fascinated by that guy. He said, when I was with him,

Speaker 6:          01:49:09       she said that I said something about the Oklahoma City bombing. I said, why is your flag at half mast? He said, because of the Oklahoma City bombing. It was at the time when I, I, uh, it had just come out that Terry Nichols had, had some relationship with, um, uh, the Timothy Mcveigh. And, um, I said, well, it seems as though the suspects that they have in custody, it was pretrial have the same sort of profile as you, ted, they're, they're, they're pro gun rights members of the Michigan militia who you say you support. Which was kind of a cheeky question. Like, I, I, if I was asking you

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       now, I'd asked it in a different way, but he, he kind of went nuts and, and, and started shouting abuse at me. He said, um, he, he became logarithmic. Like he became incapable as he was so angry. He didn't hit me or he just read it. You see that this is what, this is what the media does and why did I mention you could kiss my ass. Like he said something like Ted nugent impression by the way you even touch the, took the tone row, he said, and then he said, um, I said, what do you think about Janet Reno? He said, she's worse than Hitler, and I was like, worse than Hitler, like even if you hate Janet Reno, she's not rounding people up and sending them to their death in, you know, in, in the millions. And then, and then he had a mony said, well no one's worse than Hitler I suppose.

Speaker 4:          01:50:38       And he kinda climbed down from it. I think there's a thing that he does where he just talks a lot and I think when you talk a lot you just need to keep talking. He's also very, he talks a lot and he's very angry. He's just very keyed up sometimes, but he's watching them, a lighting guy, like he's actually quite and he can be quite. I went on a little hunting excursion with them as part of the show as well. And he's capable of being kind of a mellow, interesting dude as well. Yes. Yes. And that's what I was going to say. Like you watch them, I was hunting show. He seems very happy, like I hunt and I've watched his hunting show many times and it's, his hunting in quotes is very odd too. And this leads us to another subject that I wanted to cover with you.

Speaker 4:          01:51:19       Um, he, he hunts in his yard, right? He's got a compound of 300 acres and in Texas and he's got one in Michigan as well. And you know, he leaves out food and weight and a tree and shoots these animals. It's, it's a. So it would be caught, it would be considered canned hunting there 100 percent. Yes. But he's using a bow and Arrow, which to me, mate, I've got more time for bow and Arrow hunters in the sense that it's so much more difficult unless you're leaving food out and the animals are eating food 10 feet away from you and you're hiding in a tree. And that helps. It helps a lot. It's a very controversial method of hunting and there's two types of people in. When it comes to the hunting community, there's people that are fair chase hunters and people that believe in high fence operations and sometimes they're, they're interchangeable.

Speaker 4:          01:52:14       Sometimes people support both. Um, and I, I would. This is the way I feel about it. I think that it's a great way of acquiring meet. That's probably way more ethical than being a farmer. You know, if you're going to look at it that way, you're going to say, well, this is how I acquire my meat. I leave food out for them and then I shoot them. Okay, I see that and I agree with that. It think it's better than farming in that sense, but it's to call it hunting the same way you would call hunting, like climbing up to the Alps and looking for a mountain goat that lives in the wild or

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       going through the rockies and chasing down a moose, you know, that lives in the wild. It's a two completely different sort of endeavors. When you've got these animals fenced in, you have an account of how many are there? There's 300 a year. I need to kill one of them. You know, and that's not really hunting and one of your shows, which I found very fascinating that I watched last night was about canned hunts and Africa. Right. And that was really fascinating what a contradictory and complex subject because for folks who don't know, Africa was on the verge of a lot of the animals that are now being hunted. We're on the verge of extinction now. They have extremely high numbers all in these high fence operations and these people go over there and hunt them. And that guy that you had that own, that operation that got crazy with you and put his hand on the camera and hold it down was very emotional.

Speaker 6:          01:53:48       Where was the. I was making the exact same point you just made and I think the phrase I said, you know, if you've got a fence up and the animal knows it's going to be fed and you just hide in your little a bunker until you know the wart hog or the lion shows up knowing that the foods out and then you take a puppet. I said it's like it's like tennis without a net. Yes. And that was what he took exception to. You said it's very artificial. Something very. Any. He agreed to it. Yeah. But then what was fascinating to me, he was like, had, don't understand Africa. Africa's fucked. Yeah. Africa is fucked. I hate fucking elephants. They don't eat the shitty push. They always eat the tall trees.

Speaker 6:          01:54:32       And he goes on a rant about Africa is fucked because we eat everything and we kill everything. And he sort of A. I mean, it's a great moment because he, he in, in the act of asking, I don't think the question was that cheeky was, it was a fair question if he'd said similar things to me about, you know, it's not, is it real hunting? Not Hunting, but some people don't want a big flash cards. They wanted little shitty car, you know, that was his analogy. And I said, so when I say tends without net, he would agree. But he was, he was kind of a little tweet. Um, I think his point though, and his point was well taken and it's set him up to go to deliver a very impassioned monologue on many of the problems that are very real. You know, in Africa. Yeah, most certainly.

Speaker 1:          01:55:14       I also found it incredibly fascinating when you guys were feeding the lions because I saw both sides. They're on one side I saw like this is so strange. There's this in enclosed fenced in small area where these lines are being bred and they're hurling these calves, these dead calves over the top of the fence and these lions are eating these calves. And you were talking about how clean they. And he's like, yeah, they don't fight, they have food. Here it is right here. I mean, but the other thing he, where he was saying it was like, you think these things are your friend. Like if I, if I put you over there, if you went through they would tear you apart. Like instantly, like play with your clouds. Yeah. And play with your clothes. I was fucking dark reminders. The top part of your skull and the roots. They will eat everything and they will play with your clothes. Oh, oh, that's so fucked up

Speaker 6:          01:56:14       because it's so true. When you're close to them, it's like, just to get close to that fence like I probably 2015, 20 feet away. But just to get it was something in you that almost prevents you. You're, you know, you're safe. Like there's a fence. He's not going to not defensive, but you just physically, there's something really embedded in the psyche that tells you don't get any closer like lines when you're up close with them. Then put that video back again a little bit earlier.

Speaker 1:          01:56:40       When you see the, uh, when you throw in the, um, the cabs over the fence and you get to see the looks in their eyes when they're staring at you, they're fucking so terrifying. You don't need to put the volume on it just to show the, uh, the images of it. It's so terrifying. That such an unbelievable. And it's very different than the zoo. The zoo is a different experience and I don't know if it's because the animals get that food slid to them underneath. I mean, it's a plate of food. It's not an actual animal that they're tearing apart.

Speaker 6:          01:57:12       I, you know, I don't know. I think, I don't know, maybe they, I think he kept his lines a bit hungrier than the ones you find at the zoo. I think maybe the zoo's get handled. So they used to. Human contact is part of that as well and get handled. Ever. Zoos? Yeah. Well they can't, you can't handle lions. I'm mean you can, if you train them. I, I did a story about, um, I mean, uh, you know, siegfried and Roy, I mean, illustrates both sides of the equation. I did another story. There was a tigers, right? Targets, but same thing face. I think tigers are a little easier to train them. Lions, I don't know about that, but I know that I did a story called America's most dangerous pets and it was about people. I don't know if this is true now, but at the time it was true that there are more tigers in captivity in Texas than there are in the wild in India. I mean, there's thousands and thousands of targets in America and um, kept as pets in people's back yards and, and, and what I heard again and again was like I will get into the cage and stroke my tiger, all my lion and cuddle it and that's fine, but I am not getting coast to my monkeys. The big fear was if you have a, uh, especially chimpanzees, like they are, don't go near the chimpanzees will fuck you up. They will rip your nose off, rip your balls off and eat your face. Yeah. There's really

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       creepy about chimpanzee attacks too. Is there to aware there they're too intelligent. Like they go after they can plan and they know that you at some level they know you are the one keeping them in there. But also I think they're intelligent enough to become seriously neurotic and, and dysfunctional from confinement. Yes. Yes. Whereas a tiger I think can, I don't say it's a good life for a tiger, but a tiger doesn't necessarily become dysfunctional from being pent up, but a, um, a chimpanzee and is like a person in need stimulation. And not only that, they also know to go cut the video, they'll they also know to, to go after your fingers that go off to your balls. Like they know what you want when you want to keep your fingers. So they bite your fingers off. Like there's, there's a certain intelligence to their attack that's very disturbing as opposed to like a tiger that just wants to kill you.

Speaker 4:          01:59:36       Tiger will bite your. I read a thing about a chimpanzee attack at a zoo. Like before I went out to do the story, I was reading up on chimpanzee attacks because I knew for the story to work, I'd probably at some point have to cuddle a chimpanzee or something like that. No, it was making me nervous. Like it was making me more nervous than the idea of going into a prison cell or a jail cell where you know, you know, there's enough rationality on the part of the prisoner that he's not going to attack me and bite my balls. I mean he's not gonna shift me. He, he doesn't. There's nothing in it for him. You know? Why would a inmate attack a journalist? It doesn't make any sense, but the chimpanzee is not going to think like that. And I read an account of a, of a, of an attack at a pr at a zoo, a chimpanzee, and the news local news turned up and the chimpanzee ran over and bit the cameraman's balls off.

Speaker 4:          02:00:21       Fuck. And so then with that filming on my, I just don't want to get in the cage with a chimpanzee. Was Jesus Christ. Yeah. No desire, no desire and almost or fucking terrifying if they're a violent man, you know, really crazy. I it, that was a small one. I was like, okay, I'll cuddle this one. We had a small one on news radio wants. I'm a sitcom that I was on. Oh yeah. I remember news radio and he was a, he was only two years old, uh, or, excuse me, less than two years old, I believe he was a baby. He was small. He's got a little Zapper on him that they give him electric shocks if he, if he gets out of line. The one I had a hold of was a little smaller than that one and he climbed on my back and fucking slap me on the back.

Speaker 4:          02:01:03       Just so strong. He's so strong. It was so small. It was a small chimp, a baby chimp, but it was. It's hard as a reference because we look at a human that size and we look at a chimp that size and we're going, how fucking strong could it be like a person, like a full grown man on your back? It was a baby, but it had the strength of a man like the way it moved me around. That would make sense because the cliche and it may be true. That gets passed around. Is that a full grown chimp? It has the strength of seven men. A 500 pound man is what I've heard. Really? Yeah. See that I would pay to see like a UFC guy. It gets to full grown chimp will. You would have to take the chimps main weapon away, which is its mouth, you know, put a mouth guard on it or something that you would have to, you know, maybe men would, would, are they guys that would do that.

Speaker 4:          02:01:55       I'm sure there's an idiot out there that would do almost anything that you came with. Those guys that you interviewed that were progressors, that are beaten each other with a fucking barbwire. I'm sure if you put a mask on one of those dummies, they would, uh, they would get in there and scrap with a chimpanzee. What. But my point that I wanted to get back to was the, the, the, the complex contradictory aspect of those canned hunts and Africa. You had a draw on a warthog you were thinking about shooting it and you're like, I can't do this.

Speaker 3:          02:02:26       Yeah. It didn't make. It was, didn't make any sense. It wouldn't make any sense. I mean, I, I, it was just the whole situation, the idea that I'm going to take the life of this animal just to indulge my own sense of either what I think I need for this program to work or my sense of like, oh, I'm going to experience a experience this to see what it feels like to take. It didn't feel. I just didn't feel an urge to do it. Like I could have forced myself if you'd put a gun to my head and said, do it. I would have done it of course course. Or if you were starving to death if I was starving, but just to do it. Oh, I want to see what this feels like. It didn't feel right.

Speaker 4:          02:03:04       You had, you captured some of the more disturbing aspects of hunting on that show because those people were not doing it to acquire meat at all and you see they're trophy hunters. They're trophy hunters and they weren't doing it to acquire, meet these people were doing it to to have this to kill things and the video of them being all joyful and happy when they all got together and compared notes after their individual hunts, like several individual hunting parties had went out,

Speaker 3:          02:03:38       came out like after the second day, the first full day of hunting and then we do an inventory of that. Got like three zippers to Kudu, a gazelle and it was an inventory of kind and and you can sort of pick them out like they're on a shopping list and they know it's like 5,000 for a Kudu and it's 3000 for a Zipper and it's $20,000 for a giraffe and $50,000 for a rhino and stuff I thought was endangered is you can actually I guess not endangered and you can pay enough. I said, I thought rhinos were endangered. The guy who reinforced loop, who, who ran the place. He said if you want one, I can get you 20.

Speaker 4:          02:04:19       Yeah. How fucking crazy is that? Well, there were $100,000 American, which, well, that was what was going on in America. There was a big issue recently all over the news where there was a safari club that had auction. It was in Dallas and they'd auction off a hunt for an endangered rhino and the idea was that all this that they had auctioned off would go. There was a controversy about it that's really nice and it was also controversial because they were going to have to do something with that rhino because it was an old rhino and the old rhinos will kill the young males. They don't breed anymore, but they're still. They're very aggressive and territorial and they'll destroy the breeding male population. They'll actually kill some of them and so they had to remove them. They had to remove this rhino in order to keep the herd healthy.

Speaker 3:          02:05:05       Well, this is the thing like if you want to see the most grisly way more grizzly end up studying than any kind of UFC a show is, what's your nature program with the elephants getting lost in the mist and getting attacked by like the level of Gore. It's like the like snuff films in a sense. Sure. And so, and I think one thing that Ted nugent used to say when I was filming with him was he objected to the disneyfication of our experience of the natural world.

Speaker 4:          02:05:34       I think he's got an excellent point there. I mean, he, he's got an excellent point. I mean, think about the animals that we, we take this, this weird approach with like polar bears or a, the grizzly bears like Yogi. We turned them into our friends. You know, polar bears are the weirdest ones. You know, polar bears are like Klondike bars. What would you do for a Klondike Bar? Or they're, you know, they're fucking drinking coke. It's like, it's this weird thing that we do with the anthropomorph Promar, phising, these, these really violent, dangerous animals and some of the more violent and more dangerous animals are the ones that we, we may come cuddly and cute and bizarrely twist their nature up and that's sometimes the only exposure that people have to these animals for a long time. Like my children, my children. Uh, I have a five year old and a three year old that are just starting to understand that the animals that they see in cartoons are not real animals and that real animals don't talk.

Speaker 4:          02:06:36       Real animals are very different. I mean they, they obviously see the five-year-old especially sees that. But I'm starting to explain to her that if you ever see a bear like bears are not to be approached and they're not cuddly. They're not your friends. And there's a real big difference between a bear that's trained like a bear in a movie and a bear that you see in the wild. And so then like while their dogs in the wild will not necessarily. Sometimes there are. And if you see a wild dog, they are dangerous as well because the only thing that's not dangerous about dogs is that they are pets and that we train them, we get them used to people. So there's this weird relationship with animals that I have to sort of relate to my children. Then in doing so, I start to review this bizarre thing that we have this weird relationship that we have to certain animals.

Speaker 3:          02:07:24       Absolutely. I mean, I don't think we really know how we feel about a lot of animals and if we gave half as much thought to the conditions in industrial, in factory farms in the way our chickens and pigs are raised as we do to, um, you know, endangered species. I mean, I'm more concerned about that in a way, like the conditions of how our food is created, you know, that um, that pigs get fed their own minced up piglets, you know, and, and, uh, all kinds of hideous practices.

Speaker 1:          02:08:02       Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, it's very hideous. There's a great deal of disgusting, um, practices that, that are involved in agriculture and farming and taking care of livestock. And mad cow disease, which, you know, England had a huge issue with which, because they were being fed their own their own offspring. Yeah. And brain tissue. When an animal eats brain tissue, that's the same disease that cannibals developed. Jacob fell disease, which I think so, yeah. That's, that is the way to say it. Um, I mean that is exactly what it is. It's you, you have these animals that are eating brain tissue. The same thing as humans that cannibalize your, like it's fucked. It's fucking crazy. It's really crazy. It's a weird, weird thing, you know, that we, we, we de-humanize and we also allow ourselves to put money above humanity about above ethics and morality. And when it comes to animals, it's more profitable to stuff them into containers and where they can barely move and just feed them their own bodies, you know, and fatten them up and then sell them to otherwise that body, you know, the, the, the dead babies or whatever the fuck they feed them goes to waste the parts that we don't use for hamburger.

Speaker 1:          02:09:21       And what have you goes to waste.

Speaker 3:          02:09:23       And did you know, I mean probably everyone knows this, but you know, in the, in the world of egg raising chickens for eggs, uh, all a male hatchlings get mashed up within a couple of days of being born. Yeah. Did you know that? And then, so this is about, I don't know what the figure was like 10 million baby chicks every year I went straight into meat grinders. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:09:46       it's fucking crazy. It's crazy. It's really weird and hard to deal with. It's hard to wrap your head around the fact that people can detach so much from what they're doing to do something like that. It's uh, it's just, uh, to, to take a person who knows what's. I mean we have, if you, if you did that in front of someone who you cared about, you valued their opinion and you know, you started feeding these, these chickens a torn up chickens. He started giving a cow, a cow brains and cow meat, you know, and, and, and mashing them up and feeding them to each other. Like someone will go, what the fuck are you doing, man? Why are you doing that? Cows don't eat cows like, what are you doing, man? Ah, make us more money. Oh Man. He really. That's how you. That's how you're going to be. You're going to maximize your bottom line. They're going to feed them cow brains and they see the cows all shaky and fucked up because their neurological system is rejecting this. This notion there, they're rejecting the this practice and they're, you know, the nature actually has a whole system set in place to, to sort of discouraged cannibalism and that's really what it is mean. You cannibalize in nature fucks your immune, your nervous system. It's crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:11:03       Did you read about. Anyway, what I wanted to ask you about news radio though, because you may not know this, but when I started out in a trying to break into TV, my f, my first objective before I had my own show was to write for news radio and actually wrote a spec script and sent it to Paul Simms. Ha Ha, that's no kidding. That's amazing. You've got a meeting on the back of the script and it was sunset gower lot. Ah, yeah. You remember where we were taping that and um, in the end I went off to do my own thing. Um, but, uh, I just thought it was funny, like all that was my dream was to back in the Phil Hartman days.

Speaker 1:          02:11:44       Wow. That's incredible, man. That's incredible.

Speaker 3:          02:11:47       Do you keep up with those guys at all?

Speaker 1:          02:11:50       Occasionally, or just, uh, just to see. He was communicating with someone who worked on the crew last night. We were emailing each other back and forth. Do you know what Sims is up to? I don't know. I think he's working on boardwalk empire. That's why I had her as a writer, is writing on boardwalk empire. He's such a fascinating guy. He's brilliant, brilliant guy. But just curiosity. He was a real eccentric.

Speaker 3:          02:12:11       He'd come off. So He'd worked at spy where I'd worked the magazine and, and people kept saying that I looked like him and I and I, I fixated on it and I thought, wow. He and everyone said, oh, he was so funny and he didn't stay very long, but he was so talented and he went on to do letterman and then from letterman he went to Larry Sanders and uh, Larry Sanders at that time was viewed as sort of the pinnacle of kind of smart, funny TV. And I thought, wow, if I could get on Larry Sanders, that would be amazing as a writer. And then he went and started his own show, which was news radio. And I thought so, well maybe that'll be a smart, funny show as well. That's what I should do. So I wrote a script to winter, but I remember going along there and, and all the windows were blacked out with, with a tin foil, with aluminum exit.

Speaker 3:          02:12:53       Come along for a meeting. I said, what time? He said, well normally I get in around six in the evening. I thought, Whoa, CCS time, people go home, isn't it? So I went along and he was hanging out with a, a, like a, there was a, I'm a runner or pa or something called spider, spider, spider. And he's like, what kind of music do you like? And I'm like, if this is this, the interview, like he's asking me what kind of music and then I just, I thought it was just weird, like there was. So there was no sense of night or day. No natural light windows all blocked out. He's hanging with spider. I just thought this is kind of the spider. I was getting kind of slight, very faint cult vibes.

Speaker 9:          02:13:31       I was like, there's a little lag going on. But in a good

Speaker 3:          02:13:35       they um, they would work all night. And those were his hours. I. Yeah. Well he knew everyone had to fit in around that. Yes. If you had a family or something like that, you were fucked because they would do a writing. But that didn't affect you, right? No, it didn't affect us at all. The actors. Well there's sort of union rules for actors. They couldn't make us start work at 2:00 in the morning feed to be like, you were a writer. Then you turn on. He's like, yeah, the, that we work from six in the evening till four in the morning. And we, uh, we like to hang out with spider and we basically, we all play Yahtzee for a couple of hours and then we worked for half. I mean, it wasn't literally that, but it was Kinda like, oh my God, it's like that episode of the twilight zone where the kid is in charge of the family

Speaker 9:          02:14:15       and they're all like, oh, well he had a method,

Speaker 4:          02:14:19       his madness and the message of Bhutan this, you're very talented. But the method to his madness was that you get silly when you are a sleep deficit mode when you're really, you're really late and tired. And oftentimes that's when the most preposterous ideas are allowed to come.

Speaker 3:          02:14:33       That was his theory. Well that was the practice. I mean it really did work. He didn't, but it was that way. In other words, did he articulate that or was that he oftenly articulated it. Yeah. So it was. But it's Kinda like Vanna earhart saying like, after you stayed awake for 48 hours in, peed your pants, then you have an enlightenment experience. Well, sort of. But maybe there's another way of doing it. They were definitely, in a lot of ways, there were definitely lazy. Can I tell you, my theory is that like if you haven't made a creative breakthrough by 6:00 in the evening, then hey, why don't you go home and have a good night's sleep and try again the next morning? Well, I think they liked the idea of working under the

Speaker 4:          02:15:13       wire as well. I think they would oftentimes deliver the script for the run through, like we had to run through in the morning or a table read. Um, so if the table. It was Monday morning, Sunday night, they would still be working. If we had to be at the table read at 9:00 AM, they will be writing at 8:00 AM. Like sometimes we would get, we would, we'd go to rehearse, we'd have no table read and we would wind up rehearsing the first, uh, the first, like five pages. That's all they had. I mean, we wouldn't have a full script. We'd have five pages. And then while we were rehearsing, you know, Josh Lee would come stumbling down barefoot. His hair would be all fucked up, be smoking a cigarette. Uh, here's, um, here's the next 20 pages and you know, the next x amount of pages and we would go over that and then the next day they would. But it always came together as a really solid

Speaker 3:          02:16:02       theory. Like Michael Moore was a little like that too. It was the feeling that unless your guts are on the floor, you know, then there's a chance you might have been able to improve it with more work. Do you know what I mean? Like stay late and worry and worry and worry and stay late and work on the weekends until you just despair and you just think I can't give anything more to the process. Well, everybody has their own method, you know, as far as the creative process. And I'm

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       not saying that their method was the best, but it was fun for them and part of what the young family, they're all single. There's a few guys that were family guys that had real issues and wound up leaving, but they were, they were having fun and that having fun led them to be funnier. And I think whether or not it was a consequence of their laziness, that it was so good, or whether it was a, there was a method to their madness. I mean you would really have to take that up with Paul and he would have to really soul search to find the actual correct answer. But it worked. It really worked. And it was an amazing cost as well. Like it was you, Stephen Root, who I always thought was super back to very, very awesome actor, Dave Foley, to one of the secret producers of that show.

Speaker 4:          02:17:15       I mean, I've had dave on the podcast before and I'd love that guy to death. He's so fucking talented. And if you ever want to hear one of the worst divorce stories of all time, listen to the podcast with him on and just what kind of a nightmare divorce can be ruined his life. Wow. I'm doing. I'm researching a story at the moment about divorce. Oh God. Listen to the podcast with Dave Foley because Canada has some wacky laws. Oh, well, I want to do it in La. That does it. Well. He lives in La now, but when he got divorced in Canada or here? Yes, Canada. Really? Yeah. I was married in Canada and Canada has some crazy laws where the wife has access to the bank account for a full year, a while you're getting divorced, you're not allowed to get divorced until you're separated for a year or at the time this was the and they also have like insane laws as far as like the amount of child support you're supposed to pay.

Speaker 4:          02:18:05       His child support was based on the highest income he had ever made in his life and unbelievably unrealistic. Some. It was the height of his career when he was on news radio, so he's making an extraordinary amount of money and that that was what his child support was based on, so he had to pay that for the 18 years. His children were alive and it was all going to his wife and his wife was redecorating the fucking house and begin to hate her. Oh yeah. Oh God. Yeah. So don't you like that? I just love that whole dynamic is very strange. Love someone. You love them so much. You're willing to sign a legal contract with them and then they become your sworn enemy, and of course obviously I've dealt with that with Phil Hartman in his wife or his wife, shot him in his sleep and then there was still together though they had when they were getting broken up, but they were living together but separated.

Speaker 4:          02:18:50       They were living together, but he was leaving. He was breakup. He, they had gone through some. They had broken up and you know, he had, he had a boat and slept in his boat for a while and then came back to her and wanted to keep the family together and was trying hard to kids. Yes, yes. Very. So, you know, when people just are committed in that sort of a situation where they have to stay or if they do stay, it's devastating to their lifestyle, devastating to their emotional state. You know, it's, it's very troubling and very scary when they started attacking each other as well. When they know they go after each

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       other to try to hurt that person.

Speaker 3:          02:19:29       Did you get on with Andy Dick?

Speaker 1:          02:19:31       I got on occasionally with Andy. We had a love hate sort of a situation. He to this day maintains. It was all my fault. He was so angry. You're always angry. White Guy was pulling his dick out in front of me and jerking off my trailer. When my girlfriend was in there, he would show up, so fucked up. He couldn't read the script and he would forget his kid and leave them on set, but on the other hand, incredibly talented. Very funny, funny. I had more laughs like rehearsing scenes with that guy and doing scenes in fact guy than anybody in my life. He's an unbelievably talented guy. Deep down inside. He's a sweet guy, but he's very troubled. He doesn't even remember his childhood, like he's missing like up until like, like before, like age seven or something like that. He literally doesn't remember it. He was adopted.

Speaker 1:          02:20:21       Locked it out. Yes. He's had some. He had some hard times, you know, I mean, you don't create a guy like Andy Dick because everything turns out perfect. You know, he's the product of a lot of angst and a lot of issues and a lot of what have you. But the, you know, looking at the glass half full, he's a brilliant guy, brilliant, brilliant comedic actor and it disturbs me when I see him go off and, you know, he was sober when he did my podcast, we talked about it and you know, but then six months later he was arrested for doing this and that and getting crazy and doing drugs and you know, he's just a real, constantly troubled guy for a variety of reasons, but at his best, one of the most brilliant comic actors ever. I think it was fucking hilarious. So funny in that that show news radio just really figured out how to utilize him. Very much so. And we were very different people back there. I was very different. I was much younger, stupider, angry or version of who I am now. And I wasn't very tolerant of people like Andy. It's easier for me to snap at. Um, and you know, I, I, I'm sure I would handle him much different now if we ever did, if we will, you know, if I was thrusted in that same situation with my current personality. But that said, you know, brilliant. Brilliant.

Speaker 3:          02:21:37       Is that show still on in syndication? Does that still.

Speaker 1:          02:21:40       Oh, you just don't get money from it. I'm not sure. It's not much. I'm sure it was one of those things, the initial payment, you get a chunk and then it gets less over time. It's one of those things.

Speaker 3:          02:21:51       Um, I reached out a little bit too, Andy Dick last year because we were, we were trying to make a bunch of shows that we'll all set in la since I was living here. The idea was, you know, let's do sort of La stories and one of them was going to be standup comedians and, and we were trying to find intriguing guys, your guys who sort of represented something about. I couldn't quite figure out what it was, but I thought it was something to do with the pressure on someone who's who's their own producer, their own writer, their own performer and whose, whose performance is the performance of themselves or a version of themselves that and that that entailed a certain kind of vulnerability and a kind of high stakes professional maneuver that you go on stage and it's just you and a crowd of people and whether you might face heckling and whatnot. So that was how I formulated it in my head and also that you might be cannibalizing your own life to some extent to a material and whether that imposed a certain set of strains and whether being funny itself came from some angst or something in your background. Anyway, so that was how I forgot, but it was very hard for us to kind of find the right people. So it's sort of. We reached out to Andy and a few other people and he always said like, I really want to film with you.

Speaker 4:          02:23:06       Oh yeah, that's perfect. I'd love to do something. Light that out. You can meet me after the show and then he'd never show up or we were just not the best example. You would want to get a guy that's actually a writer. It actually does write a lot and perform a lot, but he doesn't build burger would be good. But Andy does his own material, right? Yeah, I'm sure. But you know, you want to call it comedy, right? That was the thing like it wasn't. Is it, is it, is it actually comedy? That's the mean. It's funny sometimes, but it's also out there and kind of what just sort of blurts well sometimes and sometimes he prepares things and you know, I mean, but I think he's a very, what I'm trying to say without. I'm not trying to dis him, I'm just saying that his style, if you were on it to find a standup comedian, you wouldn't necessarily categorize him as a standup comedian. You would categorize him as a performer who occasionally works in standup comedy clubs.

Speaker 3:          02:23:59       So that's a good way of, of looking at it. And that may have been one of the. But you know, in the, in our sort of a keenness to eagerness to get intriguing people, w we perhaps stretched the categories a bit in a way that wasn't helpful and that may have been a clue that it wasn't quite the right story. Or do you think there is a good documentary to be made? It felt like when I was doing it, it felt like the world was not. Dis, was too close to my own world in an odd way.

Speaker 4:          02:24:27       Um, well there's certainly something to describing standup comedy mean it's sort of kind of has been done in a way, in some ways I guess has it. I am comic. I did, I watched them all now they didn't get it. I mean, they're all, they've all got their moments, but it's almost like, um, what about Jerry Seinfeld's documented that best one? Yeah, that was a really good one. He was really open about the creative process showed well, I think one was kind of used there to make Jerry look a lot more likable. I mean, there's a reason why they chose Origami in the middle of like his struggle and angst. You know, one, I know very little, very little, you know him from that and I've had a few, hi, how are you doing in real life? But I almost felt like he was kind of thrust into that situation.

Speaker 4:          02:25:16       He seems like quite troubled in that documentary and it's almost like they're putting them in there to make Jerry look, you know, like in comparison to, to Jerry, you know, he's fucking crazy and it makes Gerry, Luke, luke, this really likable, affable, sort of together do right. Well not, not that I don't think Jerry is, but I think I just found it weird that they would choose that guy. Like why would they choose that guy out of all the comedians in New York City who was like, he liked a certain level of self knowledge. Yes. Which I think made him a spectacle. Yes. A spectacles and excellent way of putting it. Yeah. He, uh, yeah, he's fucked in that documentary least. I don't know, you know, but it's just, you know, comedy is a tricky thing, man. You know, it's um, a very bizarre art form where you, there's so many different types of comedy.

Speaker 4:          02:26:10       There's so many different styles of comedy, there's so many different ways you can go about it and you're the only one who really knows your best way and you have to find it. And the only way you find it, it's in front of an audience, one of the few art forms that you require other people's input. You require them to be there while you're creating it. You write on your own. I write all my stuff on either I write, either I have an idea and I write down notes or actually physically sit in front of the keyboard and I write long form and then cherry pick ideas out of those long forms and introduce it. But they don't. It doesn't really come alive unless you do it in front of an audience. If I approached you, I don't think we did because I'd remember, but if I had approached you to be in the documentary, what, what would've been your thought process?

Speaker 4:          02:26:54       That it would probably be intrusive? That didn't really. I probably wouldn't be interested. I would be the plus side of it wouldn't, it would seem like I would have to pay attention to all this and there's something about observing something and filming something and recording something which changes the nature of the thing itself. And I think that, uh, in standup comedy, what's really important to me when I'm creating it especially is just getting it right is like working on it and getting it right. I wouldn't want cameras there and observing the whole process of it. Then I would have to think about that as me. And where do you write when you write? I write at home. So if it's on the road, which I know it sounds like we're not going to, but if I was saying like, Joe, where do you write this is your room?

Speaker 4:          02:27:41       Can we see a notebook, a re read? Can you read out some of the. I wouldn't do that. No, I'm just sort of tell you about what my processes. But I wouldn't want and I don't even like people like filming things at my shows and I'm working on shit because I don't want to getting on Youtube or whatever. It's not done. It's like, you know, it's a sketch and then if, if that gets on youtube and then someone sees it like three months later and it's better, they still know where it's going. Like part of comedy is you want new stuff. When you go to see a band, you go to see the rolling stones. Do you want to hear new rollingstone songs? Fuck No. You want to hear the classics? You want to hear sympathy for the devil. You want to hear satisfaction. You want to hear the songs you already know that you can relate to.

Speaker 4:          02:28:28       Comedy is the exact opposite. You want to always hear new stuff. Like I have a standup comedy special that premiered on comedy central Friday night and one of the points that I've made in advertising, all these current shows that I'm doing is it's all new material. Like if you saw the thing from Saturday to Saturday night or Friday night that aired. If you go see me live next week, you're not gonna see any of that material. The materials done, it's gone, throw it away. It's filmed, it's out there and the Internet and the ether and comedy central and it's there forever. But what I do on stage now, Amanda, new stuff. So I don't, I don't want my process to be a part of what's like record because it's not done like get it, you know, and that's why we didn't do it in the end because I, that's a very understandable reaction.

Speaker 4:          02:29:15       I don't know, don't see, we would have got that across the board, but I think you could describe the process of. I would describe it, but it's boring. That's not, that's not a TV. It's not something I could, I could document and know. And then. So we figured it's too much work. Like why? Um, it takes away from the finished product. Yeah. I think when you know the whole process behind it, it's, I mean, for someone who's like a comedy nerd or a Dork or. But I say that in all loving terms, like there's comedy nerds that like come to like dozens and dozens and dozens of shows every month and they'll, they'll have seen me three or four times in a period of three or four months. I've had people come up to me and say, I love watching the material grow. I think it's amazing watching you add new bits to it or come up with new things.

Speaker 4:          02:29:59       And I'm always uncomfortable about that because then the last thing you want to do is see someone in the front row two nights in a row like that happens. Like you'll see someone like you'll be in Portland for the weekend and you see a person in the front row Friday and then their Saturday to you like, shit, this guy knows all my fucking jokes that you know they know all the set. So you feel artificial when you're setting up the bits. You would like people to see your bits when there is close to done as possible. When there close to the finished form as possible. That way you're going to get. They're going to get the best show. You have the best economy of words, you have the best manipulation of language, the best setup segues, all that stuff has been fleshed out. It's been worked out on stage, countless hours, examining notes, listening to recordings, and then performing.

Speaker 4:          02:30:48       That's what you want. You want people to get the show at its best, you know, and which is why when someone releases a special like right after the release of special, it's oftentimes not the best time to go see them because the material is like fucking scattered and they're trying to put it all together and then you see the same person six months later and it's just fucking just boom, boom, boom. It all comes together, you know, so it's a long sort of a brutal process but exciting, you know, it's challenging and you know, and it's got a lot of downs to it, but the ops are awesome when it's done

Speaker 10:         02:31:23       in a nutshell,

Speaker 4:          02:31:25       I feel like we've made the documentary. That was great. I want to talk to you about scientology. Okay. What is the, the issue that you're having in trying to pursue this and what, what exactly is the reaction to people in the scientology community now? Because it seems like the Internet has sort of exposed that religion in a way that it before it was always like, what scientology me, what is this? But now the internet is sort of all the tom cruise recruitment videos have been released and all the craziness is out and the people like that have wrote going clear that book. I'm reading that right now. I'm Lawrence Wright's book. Uh, the, the whole religion would call it a religion. Where the fuck it is. The whole movement seems to be in a very state of flux right now.

Speaker 3:          02:32:17       Uh, I think that's probably true at the same time, I think for the, for, for students of a, I guess religious, a oddity or, or, you know, new religions or whatever, whatever you want to call it, you know, it's known and it's out there in your reading Lawrence, right? I read that Lawrence. Right. But there's a vast, you know, there's a vast, massive kind of main street people for whom they still all they know is, it's that thing that Tom Cruise is involved in it, it's kind of weird, you know, and they. And so they don't know. So I think there's a huge. So I think step one for a lot of people are like, what is it, you know, it's something to do with Ufo shows and Tom Cruise and John Travolta and maybe his sexuality, but beyond that, they don't know. So, so part of it is, is trying to convey what it actually is.

Speaker 3:          02:33:03       I mean, I've been studying in the area for, you know, like reading all the books for about 15, 20 years before Lawrence Wright's. There was one by Janet reitman called inside scientology. There's a whole laundry list of books about scientology. I still don't quite get what it is to you. Well, I do in a sense, what is it, what's it called? Unquestionably. But they don't, that's fine. But it was created by a science fiction writer. Okay. But say, say that's true still, like there's lots of cults out there. Uh, what, what, beyond that, what is it, what do they, how do they practice, how they practice? Meaning what, like what do they like? We know with Catholics, they go to church, they kept confession, they eat crackers and, and it's the, the body of, of, of, of Jesus Christ rise and um, and, and they believe in the pope and, and you know, we know roughly what their sacrament is and they read the Bible and they believe in Jesus and, and so and so. So, so what is it with scientology?

Speaker 4:          02:34:04       Um, that's a good question. Um, I don't know, like if they have ceremonies, if they, I think when you look at that Tom cruise recruitment video, which is fucking fantastic, you know, when he's standing there, if you've

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       seen the one where they give them a metal. Yes, which is fucking, just so rich. It's a giant metal, many times larger than an Olympic gold medal. Uh, uh, he's wearing this metal and he's standing there in front of a fucking. It's called the freedom middle of valor.

Speaker 11:         02:34:35       Hm.

Speaker 1:          02:34:38       And um, he's standing in front of all those people and he's such a charismatic person. There it is right there. Oh, Jesus Louisa's. We'll look at that fucking thing. Come on. Just the, the lack of like understanding how you come across that would allow you to wear that, the lack of objectivity that it will allow you to put that on and, and, and be able to do this fingertips down thing on the, uh, on the desk. Like you're making a very important point while you're wearing a fucking Frisbee, a gold frisbee around your neck. It's almost like he's trying to convince himself by tricking all these people. I think there's something to that. There's something to, if you can get a thousand people to cheer at these words that you're saying and you know, no matter how fucking crazy they are, if you can get all these people to believe you and listen to you, it sort of validates that maybe you're not fucked up because you're in with all these other people that have agreed in fetuses and fucking, you know, all the other wacky shit that they believe. There's something to that where he's putting on this massive performance, not just for them but for himself as well.

Speaker 3:          02:36:02       I mean, to me it, it, it's a bit like the Oscars, like that's when I was watching the Oscars last night. I was like, wow, it's like a scientology event, you know, it's that level of, um, I think that's, that's the, that's the kind of the, the performance or the or the light. That's the semiotics of it, you know, the signifier they're trying to send a message of grand, big golden. Yeah. Important. You know, like both Oscars and the freedom, you know, he's wearing around his neck, but like is it any more silly than having a little gold man?

Speaker 1:          02:36:35       No. My friend Greg Fitzsimmons put posted something on twitter and I retweeted it. He said, I hope the Oscars get beamed to the troops so they could see all the people get rewarded for brave and courageous work. This year was such a great tweet and especially if you know, Greg is a brilliant comedian himself, but it's such a great tweet because it's so fucking right on. It's so pompous and self rewarding and self aggrandizing and so ridiculous or wearing suits with fucking special ties and you know, a formal attire and it's

Speaker 3:          02:37:14       it and, and you know, not

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       to say they shouldn't be. I mean but, but, but, but my, my point is though is that so like with Tom Cruise, okay. He's got his fingers down but in the end, so why pick on, on TC and scientology but, but, but we're letting the Oscars know. We'll say that we'll give that a pass but we can't have guys wearing golden little golden ones around their neck that they have to be little men. You know what I mean? Oh sure. Well, and also why is it okay? Why is it okay to pick on Tom Cruise? But it's not okay to pick on Jewish people with curls and there bobbing up and down. And that's their religion. That's their, their traditions. This is just a tradition where it's not a real religion in our eyes. We know the guy who wrote it. Right. Good point. That's the thing that people have

Speaker 3:          02:38:09       part of I think, and I think what I would try and do in making a documentary about is to try and see past a lot of the things that people find weird or ludicrous about it, you know, which is, you know, the fact that they have big glitzy scientology events and get to the core of what it is.

Speaker 4:          02:38:27       Well it is craziness is what it is, is nothing. You can't get to the core of it. The core of it is established sort of pattern of thoughts that allow people who are not normal to feel normal, allow people that are troubled, allow people that are searching for some sort of a structure. TC is normal. I do not think he's doing based on what. Well, based on the fact that he's so fucking famous. It's impossible to be. But he was in it before he was famous. Yes. And, and it helps the company know about that. I believe he got in at when he was still running

Speaker 3:          02:39:01       pretty early on and I think, I think jt got in it,

Speaker 4:          02:39:05       Shane in the Carter years maybe, I don't know, but very early. There's also the ambiguous sexuality aspect of it. There's the, the rumors of homosexuality that are attached to a famous male scientologists that they shield them, you know, and especially the, the, the John Travolta thing. Do you got to get out of here pretty soon where it's almost 3:00. We're almost wrapped up anyway. I think there's, there's a lot of weirdness going on and there's also the people that have you talked to people that have done expositions on scientology and what they say is that during the auditing process, when they audit you, meaning when you go over past life experiences that are quite troubling. You repeat them over and over again until they lose their meaning. Like the same thing as like if you say fuck around someone who never says fuck that, like Oh say fuck around a priest or you know, act like it's some horrible thing that you've done. We say fuck around your friends. You don't even, it doesn't even register. It's like, oh, this fucking thing. It's another word. It just, it has no power because it's so used so much, and I think maybe that's a bad analogy, but in a sense it works because what

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       they're doing is repeating the stories over and over and over and over and over again until they lose their meaning. But in the process, they're recording all this shit. So they have all this dirt on you. They have all these crazy stories. If you're going through the process earnestly, you're telling them all the secrets of your life, all the crazy gay orgies, you'd been a part of all the, the, the, the nutty fucking cocaine binges, whatever the fuck you've done that you're ashamed of

Speaker 3:          02:40:39       and you think that, that. Does that get released? The point you decide to leave? You think

Speaker 1:          02:40:45       it's a good question. I don't know. Um, I know

Speaker 3:          02:40:48       they, they, they, uh, uh, they are adamant that, that is held under a priest, penitent bond of confidentiality.

Speaker 1:          02:40:57       Of course they are, but I mean the, no, what's the mother of all rumors? The greatest rumor of all time. Yes, thank you. Richard Gere. Do you know when that rumor was released?

Speaker 3:          02:41:09       Oh,

Speaker 1:          02:41:09       when Richard Gere left scientology. I didn't know he was in scientology. He dabbled. Are you? Are you, are you serious? Yes. He dabbled in scientology and that, that rumor was released when the Tom Cruise or the John Travolta massage therapy stories were released. Allegedly that's when John Travolta was having issues with scientology. So way to keep you under wraps. This is the rumors, obviously completely unsubstantiated. I'm talking out of my ass 100 percent, but that makes sense, doesn't it? I mean if you, if you have a powerful organization that gets a certain percentage of the amount of money that you make every year and they have a lot of crazy shit on you, you'd like to go and get massages and talk these guys into Latin. You fuck them. I mean that would think that would be something that, you know, maybe if you were going to leave and take all that money away, they might, uh, they might bring, you know, assuming they have an organization

Speaker 3:          02:42:07       it any damaging. Um, confidence is about Leah Remini as far as I know.

Speaker 1:          02:42:16       Well, Leah Remini had that situation where she was saying that the leader of scientology, his wife was missing Shelly miscavige. Yeah. What's the story there?

Speaker 3:          02:42:25       Well, a lear. Is it pronounced remedy? Remedy. She alleged that David Miscavige, his wife, who hasn't been publicly photographed allegedly for a number of years, maybe even five or 10 years, uh, was being held captive or had been disappeared in some way. And, and that she'd had, she'd been at Tom Cruise's wedding to, um, who would it have been at that point? Katie Holmes in Italy, I think and said, Here's David miscavige with shelly. Why aren't you here with your wife? And it became a scandal within scientology. People felt it was disrespectful to the head Honcho David miscavige to be asking where his wife was so that she got into trouble. And then she left. And then after she left, initiated a police inquiries. She made it. She filed a missing persons report. But then the police after a couple of days said, no, she's not missing. So I guess she's not missing. The fact is she must be in a retreat somewhere somewhere. I think there's people who know know where she is, like scientology watchers, say there's a certain church headquarters up in the hills. I can't read it somewhere in southern California and that's where she's living. She, maybe she just doesn't want to be published or maybe she just wants to live on her own. Like without going public, you know, I think that's more likely than the idea that she's being held against her will.

Speaker 1:          02:43:51       Yeah. Um, could be. I don't know, but I think this kind of goes back to the, a Swami g's I what his name was that the guy who was the supposed physicist who's living with Swami Gee. Yeah. I think people love being a part of a group. Whether the group makes sense or doesn't make sense. I think people, they find comfort in that and they also get addicted to being a part of a group. And then when you're a part of something as powerful scientology, especially when you look at all the examples of people who are scientologists who are greatly successful. My old neighbor was a scientologist and we had this really weird revelation when it came out where he and I were talking, he was talking about buying a piece of land in our neighborhood and said he couldn't buy it right now because his wife was going clear and I said, uh, what are you talking about?

Speaker 1:          02:44:40       Like, what does that mean, you know? And he said, well, we're scientologist and uh, my wife is going to go clear and it cost $50,000. And I was like, this is a guy who was a contractor. He builds buildings, you know, he's not a wealthy man, you know, he does. He does fairly well, but I mean $50,000 is a giant chunk of his income. And he was talking about how his wife is going to be no longer affected by outside influence and they buy going clear. It eliminates all the negative impact of people talking shit about you or you know, fucking traffic, anything, nothing was going to get in anymore. She was clear of all that stuff that she was going to be removed from. And I was like, are you clear?

Speaker 3:          02:45:23       It's like the reactive mind is removed so you can make decisions without any interference from your reactive mind.

Speaker 1:          02:45:33       Yeah. What the fuck, I guess. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, but this poor guy was going to spend $50,000 on this and he had this sort of glassy eyed thing about, um, this sort of last thing. I think being a part of a group, we have these ancestral instincts that I think are passed down from the time where it was very important to be a part of a tribe to stay alive if you're by yourself and the hunter and gatherer times is very difficult to get enough food to stay alive. It was very hard and I think we have this bond with being a part of a group, whether it's fucking Mac users, man. I mean people that love Mac, they hate pc users. People that hate that loved pc. They hate Mac. They get in these groups, the Protestants versus the Catholics, you know, there's Chevy versus Ford.

Speaker 1:          02:46:25       People are weird that we have these weird desires to be a part of groups. And I think someone like the Westboro Baptist Church, or someone likes Swami g's disciples or someone like scientology, part of the appeal of that is being in a group and then when you have scientology, I'm not too familiar with what scientology does do. That's beneficial, but you look at a guy like Tom Cruise, sexual stuff aside, he's talking about a tremendously successful person who looks great. He's fucking 50 and he looks amazing. I mean, he's in great health. He seems like really optimistic all the time and very, very charismatic, very appealing to be a part of a group that that guy is in. If he is benefiting from scientology and from the principles of scientology, surely it can't all be wrong. Surely it can't all be bad. Let's say Louis, you're awesome, man. You got to get out of here and this is.

Speaker 1:          02:47:22       I think we're done anyway. This is. We're running a three hours in. We turn into a Pumpkin is three hours the normal length? Yes. Oh my goodness. Crazy, right? Yeah. I don't know. Get edited. Nope. Not only that, it's live and people listened to the whole thing. Sometimes. Sometimes they listened to five minutes and then go fucking bullshit liberal nonsense park these people. There's that too. Thank you for having me on. It was really fun. I would love to do it again. If you ever have anything that you're promoting, please don't hesitate. We have you in an,

Speaker 3:          02:47:48       you know, one of the reasons I came with. Well, there were two reasons, but, uh, hundreds of reasons, but one was, I was saying before I came on, there was a couple of guys outside trader Joe's and they were, they were like, you've got your own cult. They were brainwashed, Mooney's, uh, advocating on your behalf saying, I gotta go, I love your stuff. I said, how have you seen it on Youtube? I said, how did you find out about Joe Rogan was talking about it. I said, oh, really? You listen to the show Joe Rogan podcast. I hear how it's so awesome you said there's so much information. So I, I, um, I was like, well he's obviously got a lot of pull out there and um, and, and just more generally like it's just, I love getting feedback from people who've seen me on youtube button, so I'm trying to kind of put the word out that, you know, I think it's illegal actually.

Speaker 3:          02:48:32       I don't think people are supposed to have it up there, but I've, I'm okay with it. Why is it illegal? Because I think it's ABC. Technically, BBC also they get it though. They'll be like, that's the whole thing. I don't think they could get it otherwise it on Netflix or only in the UK. It's on Netflix and on different around the world on different channels, but the BBC is trying to monetize it so they want to, they want to retain rights and keep selling it. But as far as I'm concerned, it gets a lot of hits on Youtube, but it's nice to go for you for people to see it. Yeah. I mean it puts no money in my pocket, but I'm fine with it.

Speaker 1:          02:49:03       Well you've done some brilliant work, really fascinating stuff. I've enjoyed it. I've gotten countless hours of entertainment out of your programming I think so. I really appreciate having you on. It was really enjoyable. Thank you very much. See you next. What do you got coming up that people could say? Is there anything that

Speaker 3:          02:49:18       three shows going out in Britain, new ones going up the end of March and so they'll probably be put up quite soon and it's the thing I was telling about La Stories. There's the first one is about strain, abandoned dogs and our attempts to rehabilitate them using a controversial dog therapy, you know, it's like turning criminal dogs and bringing them, rescuing them, bringing him into middle class homes and then sometimes they attack the new owners and then thousands of them are killed every year in the shelters in La as a huge stray and neglected dog problem in La. Second one is about the, the hospitals where people are sort of under pressure to keep trying new, like they're close to possibly dying, but there's a new experimental therapy and they have the insurance to pay for it and it's this weird 21st century conundrum of when do I stop and say like, I just want to have a peaceful death.

Speaker 3:          02:50:08       When am I allowed to say like, I don't want to try any more chemo or these on BBC America? Uh, no, they're on the UK, BBC, normal BBC and the third one is about sex offenders living down in south la, especially around torrance who live in these hostels with a electronic bracelets, heavily monitored lives and the whole, the strangeness of having done something so terrible, you know, they've abused their own children or some of them are rapists and so on. And then they've done, you know, whatever. We're 10 years in prison and they've come out and they're on parole. And to what extent, if any, you know, do we give people a second chance? I give her. They're out. We're going to live. We are living alongside them, you know, more or less with certain restrictions. What do we, how do we relate to those guys?

Speaker 1:          02:50:53       Well, those are three fascinating subjects, so I'm just saying that I can't wait to watch those shows. Really big fan man. Really appreciate you coming on.
