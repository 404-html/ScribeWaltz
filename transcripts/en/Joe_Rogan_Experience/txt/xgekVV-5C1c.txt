Speaker 1:          00:00:11       This is my granddad's plan alone. You don't want her job to, this is you're making me very, very uncomfortable. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by [inaudible] dot com and that's o n n I t, makers of Alpha Brain shroom tech shroom tech sport. Had to take my alpha. Right. I already took it once broke. Fuck it. It was a late night podcast. My Man Duncan Trussell hello friends. Had to, uh, we had to do another podcast today. Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't just leave well enough alone. He wants one of these probably. I would love some. Here we go. Can you snort these? I guess you probably could. Probably wouldn't. We were right by the door. Huh? Um, what are, what are nootropics? It's all, all the information is available on [inaudible] dot com and that's what I'm Alpha brain is. It's a nootropic. So essentially it's a blend of nutrients that's been designed to enhance the way your brain functions.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       Go to [inaudible] dot com for all the details. It's o, n, n, I, T and nick. And explain to you what are the findings behind each ingredient. That is a bin, you know, designed to give you like a nice boost. It's not like, um, anything that it's going to change you and make you a smart person, but it's going to make your brain function at a good level. But we guarantee you will raise your Iq by 20 points. No Dunkin and you're just making that up. You can't do that in the middle of a commercial on the Internet. He just fucked everything up buddy. Finish this fucked up the whole world. You know, you don't have to finish the sentence. It's written somewhere. I tell you, he's going to need some of these fucking Alpha brands. Who the people living in Dallas, Texas right now getting dusted.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       I with the poison. They're spraying over at the Kel does mosquitoes, the West Nile up camp there publicly. Kim Trailing Dallas with some kind of insecticide because these uh, uh, mosquitoes there have West Nile virus. Nine people have died so far. Oh Shit. That's no fun. And there's people were just writing about it. Somebody just wrote, Hey, let's do it. Let's get through with this then we'll talk about that. Let's get through this commercial for, sorry, Ladies and gentlemen. The Alpha brain has got him speaking crazy. He wants to get to this subject before the commercials even over. He's insane. Gotta go Duncan Trussell so there's a lot to cover. We have so much to cover. I'm new to [inaudible] dot com we have this a hemp protein powder called hemp force, which is a amazing naturally sweetened with Stevia, Maca and raw cocoa or also in it. And raw cocoa is a great antioxidant. It's really delicious too. It's the best tasting protein over had an though the easiest to digest because it's a hemp protein doesn't make you feel bloated

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       at all. Your body has like a really easy time digesting it. So I like it. If I have to work out in like an hour or something like that, I can get away with it where I couldn't. If like it's a whey protein, I might get a little bit more farty up in this cheese. It's way it's way is like, forget it. It's like living inside a coffin in my office. Yeah. Well, your body's not really supposed to be processing that kind of milk because it's milk without all the digestive enzymes. You, you're supposed to drink milk only from your mother, right? That's it. But if you're going to drink milk from an animal, cow's milk is the way to go. Raw route, make sure they have an organic diet of grass. They just eat grass. And then that milk is actually really nutritious for you and it has built in like there's, there's enzymes in it and all this stuff that gets killed when you pasteurize it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:49       And that stuff is what makes it easier for you to tolerate. So people who are lactose intolerant, oftentimes if you get them to drink natural milk, they have no problem with it. This is like, you know how like you think of videos that you'd like to see, like if you got five videos that you can see from any point in time, you could go anywhere in time and see like youtube clips. I would give anything to see the first man to drink milk from a cow. That first person who figured out that you can fucking do that. Like I have so much to talk about. Dude, just get through this commercial so that cause we're, we're going to miss all the people that listen to us on serious. They're not going to get that part. Oops. They get, they come in complaining with long ass fucking commercials.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       I'm not that good at this. This part. I'm not good at all. i.com go get yourself some kettlebells. Become a fucking manly man. All right.

Um, it was really uncomfortable because it's like they, the guys like, Hey, yeah, can I walk into your car? Right. Like it was like the end of the workout. Like no one's asked ever in my life to walk me to my car. It's so crazy the hunted, but my mind tried to process it for us. It was like, well, can you know my car? Is it like, oh, you're trying to fuck. Oh God, you want a quick little sweaty fuck in your car? Oh Jesus. That's ball

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       bacteria that bombing. Oh, back here. Have you seen, did you see that reddit and the guy had dipped his balls in a petri dish to grow to see what Schick rue on it. And it just flourished with bacteria cause there's just a sea of bacteria on every man's right.

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       Oh my God. Anyway, go to [inaudible] Dot com o n n I t use a code name, Rogan and save 10% off all supplements. That's right. Alpha brain, shroom tech, all that shit. Code name, Rogan, save yourself 10%. Um, and uh, the kettlebells and the battle ropes, the 10% does not work on those. Those are being sold that literally as chief as as humanly possible. They're fucking awesome. Heavy ropes. So like big thick, like, like Siemens ropes. Ah, you know, like one of those sure that you used to fucking nautical ropes and shit. Yes. Giant end.

Oh my God. It's ruthless to it. It's amazing. It's incredible workout. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:07:02       You guys are like bioengineering, some army or something happening. You're like selling smart pills and bound to give people

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       smarter, stronger, more aware with a big quarter. It'd be no order. There's also a no end of this commercial because I don't have a fucking musical player thing. I don't have one. So let's fake it. [inaudible] beginning battle ropes now starts battle ropes, Daca Trussell the fuck is going down. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:07:36       You know I, I just, speaking of going down, what's going on down is going on. What's going on? I saw a, I really, he's being in battle ropes. I saw this very disturbing video today. Have you seen the thing about all dudes with broad sorts chat chopping the heads off pigs? Whoa. No Way. It's fucking weird dude. Cause they're like, oh my God. You know like warriors, they're just older guys that may be a knife convention or something. I'm not sure what it is. They have a broad sword and they're just lopping off the heads of pigs. Oh my God. Like hanging upside down. Just lopping them off and the fucking sword. It really does demonstrate bloody battles he used to be because they just, it's like they just slide right through the neck of that fucking pig. Just slide through like a knife through butter and the sound is so gross. This flake foolish and these weird old dudes just swinging these sores. It's fucking strange, man. Jesus Christ. So glad that we got past that phase of human history that got some of the events in a gun. Yeah. And that funny. I hate if I got to choose, I'll take a gun, I think. Yeah. Yeah, I'll take it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:46       I'm sure there's far less violence today than there ever was when they were swinging swords around. I'm sure it's like no comparison.

Speaker 3:          00:08:52       Well, yeah, I mean you could just think how easy it was. If you are a bad mood to kill

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       somebody. Back then there was no DNA finger up. There's no fingerprints. If you're just wandering through a town, you just see a, a particularly plump young child dragged that thing into the woods. So why don't, why isn't it weird? There's no amber alert. That was not that long ago in human history, you know? Oh no man, we were just thinking of all humanity is the, the humanity that preys upon. It's young. It's like they're young, they're youth was ruined and so now they want to ruin you youths. It's almost always the same story. So it was a scary, frightening aspect of humanity. You're talking about people that want to, you know, abduct kids. Oh yeah, yeah. But it's a, it's almost always comes from something being done horrible to them. Well, yeah man, that's the opposite of this thing called the disipling succession, which is this idea that people get super, super smart from time to time by meditating or drugs or something happens to them.

Speaker 2:          00:09:53       And then those people like transmit that to the closest friends, which gets transmitted down, uh, until it ends up in the present moment. It's called the [inaudible] succession. Um, you know how like you get it right. It's like one thing to hear someone from someone happy, but when you get around someone who's really advanced and really happy, you walk away with this kind of like extra thing, like get something into you know it like they give you something from being around him so that the idea is that certain times people have like a massive burst of that, you know, like the monkey that came out of the tree or the monkey, the first used a certain tool or certain people have that exact same kind of like blast and the people in the close proximity to them, they get it and it transforms them and then they give it to the next person that goes through time.

Speaker 2:          00:10:42       The simplex succession in the same way. There's an opposite of that. There's like a, an an anti uh, enlightenment, anti happiness, just a foul poison that started way, way, way back when and gets transmitted from one person at the next to the next and this endless chain of shit that ends up with like people doing monsters things. It's quite curious. It's almost like a race between those two. It's weird how pliable the human consciousnesses, you know, it's weird how the human consciousness, depending upon how you're raised can be thrust in so many different directions. You know, it's so weird. Like we are so not like in an easy thing to develop now. We're like, we really were super duper complicated. We have all sorts of crazy emotions, irrational ideas of the past, irrational views of our own memory. You know, and we're all going through this whole weird thing together trying to feel our way through it. Well he's completed. We're so irrational. We're so, it's such a strange animal. Well it sucks man. And we've got these sedimentary layers of of of times in history where you,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       you are just being ravaged by famine and disease and yeah, it's fuck, it was rough man. I mean if we think about that, like even now people aren't safe and you can call nine one one and a half, cops come to your house within 30 minutes, you know, depending on where you're at. Sometimes faster. If something catches on fire dial nine one one little red trucks come and put it out. They just trucks with water inside of them. If there's no water around, think about that. But not very long ago Manson that catches on fire. It's like that's shit's going down. You know, if somebody, if your friend hurts himself, you're not calling nine one one you're going to wrap him and like 30 bandages and just hope for the best. It's like, so that means that people, there's a lot of fear embedded into us genetically from those times.

Speaker 3:          00:12:43       You know, there's an angry little eight man living inside everybody you can see anytime you get mad you can. Yeah, that's him howling out in the depths of your being. You know, and yeah, there are differences. Some people still listen to that howling eight freak who's like terrified and screaming out of the universe and believe that that's them and they become that crazy primal scared of being in. Some people have started to realize are completely realize that that's just one old sort of a almost outdated appendage, a psychic appendage stuck inside humans and you don't have to listen to the screaming fucking ape. Every time something bad happens, you can operate from another place.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       Yeah. Yeah. You can. And mean we're moving towards that. As long as we can keep this whole society thing together, keep giving people food and purpose, we can, we can slowly but surely make these leaps into the next stage of consciousness yet. So we got to keep everybody fed. You know, he'd riots from breaking out. It's really hard to keep rights from breaking out when you're blatantly lying to people, you know? Yeah. That's a problem. This fucking Julian Assange thing is really good. It gives me the spooks man, because it's like you will explain to the folks who don't know what the fuck's going on, what's happening. So Julian Assan yeah. Launches

Speaker 3:          00:14:00       this. A guy created a website card, wiki leaks and uh, he was kind of the face behind this a website that people send secrets, government secrets. People sent him a shit load of files that showed a helicopter gunning down reporters among other fuck that fangs. And, um, so he, uh, he got in a lot of trouble with the military industrial complex, essentially just pissed off the military industrial complex. He, um, he, uh, and ended up, cause it's something happened in Sweden. No one really knows exactly what it is, but the UK is treating it like whatever he did in Sweden, like he just went around fisting nuns and setting fucking buildings on fire. Like they are doing everything to get them back to Sweden for what I think is a relatively small charge. That's the party line. I think it's called surprise, surprise. Sachs. A very odd thing, man.

Speaker 3:          00:14:56       Like, yeah. And, and, and also men, I'm not to be a complete fucking conspiratorial Weirdo, but a lot of people say that there are some basic things. If you want to get somebody, uh, that you can do. And one of them is you set them up with some kind of sex crime. You know what I mean? You can, you can entrap somebody. I'm not saying he's, I don't know what happened, honestly. But you know, in society now, if you were running an empire and you had an enemy and a really public enemy, it goes past the point where you can just assassinate him. Like in the good old days, like in the good old days, if someone had some information, you just fucking Sinan is one of your assassins to come through their window and give them a quick snip on the throat, leave your fucking Sigil or whatever your sign was.

Speaker 3:          00:15:39       Because sometimes you want people to know that your enemies die and that was it. Now assassination is a little more complex. You know, you've got to like if someone gets in the public eye, they can't just suddenly hang themselves. You know, if suddenly a song just dangling in the, in the embassy there, they came into the, in the, in the bathroom and assign just hanging by a fucking rope wearing women's panties, right during women's panties with maybe some caulking, kitty porn scattered around. We don't know. He just freaked out in there from the stress and he tried to do auto erotic, a fixation cut to CNN, CNN, barely a peep about the libor scandal. Boom pervert, pedophile asage found dangling in the embassy wearing women's underwear, pink with Mickey mouse pictures on them. You know what I mean? It's like that, that's a way that they try to defame you and make you seem like you were, um, not valid that you are, no one should have been listening to you in the first place.

Speaker 3:          00:16:36       That's one way to assassinate somebody in this libor scandal. What exactly is behind them? They were adjusting the fucking interest rates. They were like fucking with interest rates, not not based on real reality, but based on the urgings of the government from my complete low level understanding of this shit. But basically it somehow is just, uh, one of the indications of the things that we hear all the time from some like really hardcore can, you know, as conspiracy theorists who were saying that the, the, uh, you know, world economies are just being controlled by bankers who are shifting numbers to benefit themselves. You know, and this is like of course the military industrial complex or war quite often as benefiting someone in a massive way, you know, so it's just part of that idea that the way things are happening on the planet right now are based on some form form of humanistic logic but are based on uh, economic, um, the economic drives a very, a very small amount of people and make a shit load of money when bad shit goes down.

Speaker 3:          00:17:40       You know, like whenever there's a fucking war, there are people who make so much fucking money, man. I mean it's nice, you know, like the way I, if like I fucking was the bucket, like get my own TV show. Like if I, if I was able to sell a show, right, that would be a big deal for me. That'd be awesome. That'd be an incredible moment. My life. And that same way that I'm excited about that. There's people who are like, oh, come on, I ran say one more antisemitic thing. Come on. If we just get one more sign that you want to attack Israel, we can fucking get in there. And if we get in there, they're going to need a lot of mine knew XP 49 double double edged fucking missiles and I'm going to make a ton of money. You know, and those people have lobbyists that talked to senators and congressmen and their point is, the reason isn't for, um, the reason isn't because it's like, you know, I imagine it's like when you're fucking a whore, you know the reason she's fucking you as for money, she's not fucking you cause she likes you.

Speaker 3:          00:18:43       She's fucking you. Cause she wants money from you in the same way. These are, these are powerful. Uh, uh, conglomerates are making moves that are based on their own economic gain. I this doesn't obvious. I don't mean to be so fucking obvious. Right. But you know, the idea was that, I mean,

Speaker 1:          00:19:00       we were supposed to be shielded from that. That was the idea. Yeah. It wasn't supposed to be possible. Yeah. When that became possible and an obvious and policy, that's when the real problems began as far, I mean, as far as like my own personal awareness, when I started seeing it, it became a much more blatant, it seemed like later on in life and this most recent supreme court ruling about it where they said that corporations can act as individuals. Right. It's just insanity. This is if she could just give as much money as they want to give, like you guys can work out a deal. I'm going to be president it. Well, how much do you want to give to my campaign? How about 1 million bucks? How would I love you? All right. I love you too. And I work together. All right. Give me some motivation.

Speaker 3:          00:19:41       Yeah. It's quite sad. It's a, um, it's a sad situation. Uh, and, and um, it's a strange situation. It's a strange situation and uh, it's a, it's a situation that up until this point, I mean, it was pretty easy to hide this shit. Yeah. You could really control information. Yeah. You can. People can just look in their phone and fucking Google anything. Yeah. It's almost like everybody's waking up going, wait, what, what, what, what, you know with what the effect reminds me of Joe. I just fucking bought a TV. I'm an American. I haven't had a TV in so long. I went to fucking, um, best buy and bought it. God Damn One of those nights, logins. You try to be like Mr Bohemia and I don't need a TV. It was, um, I don't know. Since I've been in that fucking house, I am nine months.

Speaker 1:          00:20:27       The TV is awesome. Anybody who tells you the TV's not awesome is an asshole.

Speaker 3:          00:20:31       No TVS. Awesome. No, I wasn't, I didn't have a TV out of some hate for TV. I didn't have a TV because I understand my composure and a plug that Xbox and pop in Skyrim and just vanish from society for four years. Yeah, that's my problem. But the thing about new fucking TV

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       is, um, the pictures too good. It's too clear. It's like you watched the x men and it's like seeing like people just walked out of like a, uh, I don't know, a fucking West Hollywood aerobics class. They just look too real. It looks silly. It's too real. It something about the pictures too. Good. Yeah. There's a different quality to it where it makes old movies look like shit. Yes. It's too good. It looks silly. No one looked really bad, man. I saw aliens to the other day. The, the movies still holds up. It's still a great movie, but there's some background scenes where they had a painted spaceship. Yeah, and it was so bad because it's so obvious and not with the incubator with Hd. So in the same way, it's weird because it's like that technology is imitating I think what's happening to people's perception of things.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       Somehow when a president starts doing the presidential talk or when you see a like what's happening in fucking the UK where they're saying where the [inaudible] no, no, no, no. Listen, we have a right to what we have to enforce this. This is the deportation of a sauna to Sweden. It is has nothing to do with a thing where he leaked terabytes of information about the military industrial complex. Nothing to do without that. That's just a coincidence. We've got to get him out to Sweden because he did a surprise rate. Now surprise sucks and pride. It's a pride sex. I guess it's kind of the same thing, but what happened was they had had sex and then he was in bed with her and then he had no condom. Can I stop you for a second? Supposedly, I want to apologize to everyone that I just used the word Rape Dan, so sorry. I said that word. I will never use it again. The words done. I will never use that word. I've taken that word and I have tied it to a fucking bad. It's the new faggot rapist. The new failure. I don't even mind neuro. My neurological system cannot process that word.

Speaker 2:          00:22:46       I don't even hear that word. I don't hear any bad words. I've got a new, I've got an, I've been taking a, an a new fucking arm, no tropic and makes it so that I can't hear offensive words really can enjoy a comedy show cause nothing ruins a comedy show more than when it comedians that something unethical or immoral. Ooh, I hate it. I'm just trying to have a good fucking time. You, I don't want to be lectured on what you throwing your lefty beliefs my way. Oh my lefty beliefs. No, no, no. I'm saying to the comedian, what's our hypothetical comedian that we're just making out? Yeah, I don't I, yeah, you comedian person blogger, swamp toad helping.

Speaker 2:          00:23:29       We got our sold the mouth shut. We got so the sinner's mouth shuts. We can't let them speak. We can't let them talk about the things that happen in the world. We don't like. What is so weird about people that they're so easy to program? Like they're going to be programmed so many ways and you gotta look at like people in North Korea like all crying for real in the street. When they did their dictated died. I mean they were like for real legit crime on the street and then look at people in America and seeing how much different we aren't. Then you know, the people in China, people in India, it's so we're, we're so adaptable and we're so fucking variable. We're so different. It's such as we have the strangest fucking animal ever. We are a strange, we are strange fucking creature man. We went from background to foreground.

Speaker 2:          00:24:14       It's like all the, it's like animals are so absorbed in the nature when you watch a fucking squirrel running around and you see how like in nature that thing is just part of the earth, almost just the earth. Humans are like a few steps past that. So it's like we came out of a picture, we like came from the background into the foreground. This is the, this is the idea that uh, they tried to metaphorically talk about in the story of the garden of Eden, which is, you know, eat before they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They were unaware that they were naked. It was like there more, more animals. And then this represents a, I think Mckenna has said, you know, this is the representation of the, uh, expansion to the neo cortex. This is the beginning of human brain development is suddenly becoming aware of ourselves, of our bodies, of the fact that we have a fucking body.

Speaker 2:          00:25:09       Cause you know, animals they don't think about they're buttholes, you know, like dogs aren't thinking about like what their balls look like when they're running. They're not thinking about their, their fucking hair. If it's messed up, that doesn't cross their mind at dogs. Never worried about its hair being messed up. But humans like we fixate on that shit. Like we spend so much time thinking about how ashamed or ridiculously we proud we are of our bodies. It's fucking hilarious how much time you really consider how much time you fixate on your body one way or the other. We're, we're just into our bodies, so yeah, man, that's this. Um, that's one of the weird, bizarre aspects of human being human. As you're aware, you're aware of all the stuff you like. You know, you're aware of why you love, you like you. It's a puzzle to you.

Speaker 2:          00:26:01       You see a woman with a thin waist and then a big ass and big breasts and you're like, you don't even know why there's like, triggers are going off evolutions. Like that's the shape you're looking for. That's the shape you're looking for. Calves, calves from being accentuated by the high heels and little fucking weird. How weird is it that every woman shaves her legs? Like you have to like, that's not really what their legs look like. Especially girls with dark hair, you know, any, anything like really, uh, w will it be the word spicy? You know, and he like Greeks or something along those lines. Italians love those girls. If they didn't shave their legs, oh my God. Do you know what kind of you'd be looking at was the longest. See? Have you ever let your, your whole pubic area grow before he trimmed it?

Speaker 2:          00:26:50       Yeah. Do you have a trim it? Yeah, I trim it. But there have been long, long periods where I'm sure the thing is just, if you look at it, but it's just ridiculous. It's like all over the place. It's just a cabinet chaos. Chaos. Chaos. Yeah. But, and then you imagine that covering your entire body. And that's what we used to be. Just like a lot of people still are Bush. Never see, was it George George the Animal Steele? Is that what's his name was so wrestler, I think it was George, the animal steel something, the animal Steele. And he was, he looked like a fucking gorilla. He's the Harris human being ever. And he was huge. He just as big giant fucking, you know, superhuman muscles and hair covering his whole body. Robin Williams. Uh, this guy was more freaky. Robin ones is pretty fucking Harry's.

Speaker 2:          00:27:34       Yeah. But this guy is built like a gorilla to though, I mean it's like, it's like, it's real close. I mean, he was, he was in, um, one of those movies. Um, one movie was, I feel like he was in a movie. I'm not remembering it right. Well man, the thing, I think he did, I think he had a career in like horror movies or something. We're very close to something that just, it's no longer here anymore, but people's minds are still, some people are still functioning at that level. Uh, and, and in some people know that some people are still functioning at that level and understand how the nervous system works and are really good at tricking people. You know, cause once you're like, just like if you still identify with the howling screaming animal inside of you, yeah. You're really easy to manipulate.

Speaker 2:          00:28:23       You know, it's not that hard to fucking trick a monkey and going for a banana. It's like legendarily easy to get a monkey to go for a banana. I want you to come over here and just look at what George Steel looks like. So you see what, what, what kind of ridiculousness I'm talking about. Ha. Can you imagine? It doesn't look real huge dude covered in hair and he's, he's bent over looking at you like he's about to charge like a solar back. Looks like a stop motion character from clash of the titans or sounds hilarious. That's weird. And he did some acting think it was in like, yeah, he was in ed wood I believe with Johnny Depp. Yeah. And he it on a fucking crazy looking and do, but he used to like eat the corner like you live, whatever. I'll turn buckle. He would grab it and bite it and start eating it and ripping it apart. He was fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:29:21       What a weird life that must have been. Huh? We had a professional wrestler. Yeah. That's a really weird life. That's one of the weirdest aspects of our culture ever. Professional wrestling. You mean like worldwide wrestling, world wrestling, entertainment. I haven't watched while wrestling since the great Kabuki man. People still love it, dude. I was the only, well it does really well. It's, it's fucking crazy. What is it man? It's like a form of fucking dance basically. Isn't it? Like it's like choreographed fights. Yeah, they, you know, are fake but it's fucking hard to pull off to it. And those guys getting beat up, those guys are always throwing each other down. Right. The Shit. But it's not, it's not real fighting. It's like a form of gymnastics. Tumbling. What's a work? You know? It is what it is. It's a hard, they do what you call it would call hard work or they really, they slap each other occasionally they'll fucking, they'll close online, each other.

Speaker 2:          00:30:11       They really slam each other to the ground and you could really get fucked up doing it. They all have like, you know, back problems and shoulder problems. And the cool thing about it is not just the fact that they're fake fighting, it's that there is a narrative. Yeah. Weird ruin a rudimentary narrative that runs through the fucking thing where they, everyone's has rivalries. Yeah. And, and there's, uh, there's always a villainous guy has g like generally like supernatural undertones. Like maybe he's come from hell or something. Right. There's like always that the taker, yeah. These mysterious men who've emerged from like the darkest parts of the world, the slap each other's backs really hard. When I was in high school, it was Bob Backlund, he was the champion and the big one was that everybody wants to see fight for the title was Jimmy The superfly snuck a Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And it was a big deal. Matt and he would put up his three fingers like this and he would go, I love you. Those what he was telling everybody when he had his fingers up, I love you. And they fly through the air. He would fall, lie through the air dude inland on guys. And what a beating his body must've taken doing that, man. I do. Do you ever did some ridiculous shit? I remember when I was a kid. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:31:33       Getting into some fairly serious arguments with people over whether or not wrestling was real. Oh, hook is you, it'd be like, no, no, no. This is fucking real dude. Do you think this is fake? You fucking think the great Kabuki, like a guy could just blow steam out of his mouth and poison a man. He's real. You are getting these like deep, oh yeah. Before they had to admit it was fake for like, right. But you see that tax purposes, you see it's still happening. See, this is the funny thing. It's still fucking happening. Yeah. Only now when you tell somebody, you know, um, our Congress is bought by corporations and it's not really representing the people anymore and you can, you cannot, you, uh, you know, that's, um, that's, that's real. It's pretty obvious by now. You tell that to people and they'll be like, no, it's real.

Speaker 4:          00:32:20       It's real. It's real. It's the realest thing there is. How could you say that's not real? These men, these fine men, not the high seats of power. They're not getting bribed by corporations. No, never. They have integrity yet again. And again, time and time again, we see that people have been supported by lobbyists to the point where I saw someone, um, uh, put like on one of the, I think one of the presidents or I don't remember which it was. Maybe he's, I don't remember who it was. Maybe Baner the guy looks like howdy duty. I can't remember who it was, but put all their main corporate sponsors like a NASCAR outfit. You know, like they said like senators and congressmen should start having to wear, I think Robin Williams had that in a special, oh it dead. Is that what he said? I saw a picture of it on the Internet, but, but the, the, the, the, the, it's the truth.

Speaker 4:          00:33:11       But there's still people who want, who don't want to believe to believe that's the truth. And this is the fucking problem man. Cause it's not just politics, it's religion. You, you, there's people. I just have you seen this fucking I, it keeps popping up on the Internet, but it's like this idea that evolution has had that the way some an or the creation creationist believed that the way some animals got from one continent, the next is from graphs of the forest sup rooted by the great flood. So like bears and rabbits and squirrels were just like floating across the ocean on logs. Like they, people believe that stuck creation is at. Dude, imagine that just labs covered in rabbits and puppies and eagles. It's this craziest thing fucking ever. But, but, but people believe that right now.

Speaker 5:          00:34:02       Well, there have been guys who have invested money to try to design and recreate the arc. How did thank you. If could have worked. It's just been dudes have done that. Like there's some rich dude, I think he's in Holland and these uh, recreating uh, an art right based on cubits and what are the flood could ever fucking crazy measurement they use back in when the Lord's work.

Speaker 4:          00:34:23       How many fucking lunatics right now? How many crazy people right now in neighborhoods and trailer parks across America are in their backyard constructing an art cause they think God told him to build an Ark. I bet there's at least 400 people right now hammering in their backyard on a fucking arc because they had a weird dream. Our God told them to build an Ark.

Speaker 5:          00:34:44       There's definitely more than one. I've definitely heard of more than one person. Talk about grandiose. Imagine you thinking you're really Noah, but that's like, you know if your cuckoo for cocoa puffs, that's a, that's a, that's an entertaining one. You think you think you're Noah? Oh my God. I mean, but dude, imagine if like your fucking brain speaking to me. Wait, what? Hope what Joe?

Speaker 4:          00:35:05       It is high the Lord. I'm going to flood the planet because I'm pissed.

Speaker 5:          00:35:09       That's why I always thought it's hilarious when you see like a fake seance or a seance. It looks like obviously full of Shit. Hold on, I'm getting a signal. He saying he's saying there's a hole or his heart used to be. What does that mean? Does anyone know what that means is speaking to me.

Speaker 4:          00:35:28       I just fucking saw on Trinity Broadcasting Network. If you ever watched TBN. Yes. So I just saw some remedy broadcasting network. This fucking televangelists say, do you want that new house? Do you want that new condo? That $2,000 isn't going to get you a condo or a new house. Plant that seed money in my ministry and it will come back to you 10 fold. A hundred fold. So this guy is on Tbn, compelling people who've been saving up their money to buy a house, to send that money to his fucking ministry. He's tricking dumb asses and just funneling money to him in the idea that they're going to send $2,000 and because he says it, it's so terrible what he does. He's like Trump. He's aiming it though. If people like, uh, illegal immigrants, one of the things he said is, ah, you know, won whoever since $2,000 to me, his green card had already been denied, but he went to the mailbox and you got a letter underneath his bills and he opened that letter and it said he had been accepted, his green card had been accepted. So you're like trying to hit these like the most desperate humans who are like as a combination, desperate and dumb, watching TV late at night and they just have a little bit of money left, but maybe they're a little drunk. Oh, you're like, yeah, this is it. This is what I need to do. This is what I fucking need to do on giving money to the Ministry of father fuck face and it's going to come back. It's crazy

Speaker 5:          00:37:08       doing that. That's seeding. That's pretty recent. That used to be just a donation thing, but then someone came up with the brilliant idea of saying that you're planting seeds and that you get it back. Well let's see the pause and just a donation anymore. It became like, you know what I mean? Like it wasn't like that for a while, for a while,

Speaker 4:          00:37:26       donations, but the problem is, man, with all this stuff, this is where religion gets confusing. It's a lot of the metaphysical principles these people were throwing out there. They're real. If you put good energy out into the world, it does come back to you. It is true. If you put, if you put good things out in the world, it's like throwing a fishing line out and it was a really good chance you're going to reel back something awesome that you didn't expect to get, but it's like these sons of bitches, they're like making it as though there's an actual spiritual economy in the universe where if you did, there's some kind of new quantifiable bank account balance where if you send 2000 you'll get 20,000 based on some specific crazy laws. That's, that's where it gets odd and that's where it's kind of fucked up because

Speaker 5:          00:38:11       it isn't. It isn't because the wounded antelopes have always been jacked by the waterholes. That's just the way it always been. Have. You're so fucking dumb that you think that that guy's really going to be able to do that with your mind. It's almost like you're, you have to exist as an example of folly. You have to exist as a, as an example of like when anybody gets scammed by one of those Nigerians. Yes. One of them, I watched this one thing were talking about, it was a dude who was really sad, man. The guy just didn't have any companionship. He didn't, didn't, didn't have a girlfriend, really wanted a girlfriend and it just spent all his retirement money sending it to this Nigerian scammer, went to Europe to meet this chick twice,

Speaker 4:          00:38:49       twice, twice. You kind of broke down during the shower. Brutal because

Speaker 5:          00:38:54       he, his Pr, his daughter or someone had to tell him that the woman wasn't real. Someone close to him who was trying to explain to him at the moment wasn't real, but he just wanted to believe he went to Europe twice to meet her, do it twice and like she said, she couldn't find him. Oh my God. I'm getting called back by my family. Right. And this poor fucking guy bid it, but it hook, line and sinker. And everybody spoke to her and just kept sending money.

Speaker 4:          00:39:18       See, it's really cool mag because we keep going back to talking about believing in bullshit and the effect that it has on your life. The immediate detrimental effect it has on your life to believe bullshit. No matter what the fucking thing is, it always fucks up your life. Whatever the fuck it is. If you believe in something that's crap, you end up making decisions based on crap. And so you've just summon more and more negativity into your life from believing in bullshit now where it gets fucking weird man. And where like there's a part of me that is always combating what the apparent violent and brutal merciless aspect of nature with my own instinct to want everybody to be okay. And, and like, those two things are really fucking confusing for me because you look out into the world, you know, and you, you see any on the nature channel just, you know, watch a fucking hyena taking a bath and the carcass of a fucking elephant or watch fucking, uh, those, those tigers in the Russian circus.

Speaker 4:          00:40:18       You just attack. Those dudes are look at the fucking, um, uh, in China though, the monstrous way that they're, you know, slice the skin off of living dogs. Or you can go on and on with examples of this kind of brutal, the slaughter houses everywhere, you know? Right. The brutality of nature, you know, and, and, and, and, and you can go into this Nietzschean mind state where you're like, you know, yes, that is, that is as much a part of the universe as anything else. And then there's another part of you that if you start thinking that way can become a bit, uh, a bit nihilistic where you start thinking like, oh, well, if there's a wounded antelopes, then why help them, you know what I mean? But let let them suffer for their own good. Let them come to understand life through their own transgressions that they can grow on their own and become powerful by their own volition. And that's fucking cool, man. There's part of me that really loves that idea. And then there's another part that's like, yeah, but what if, you know, there's an actual concerted effort at work right now, a concerted effort by a kind of a combination of many different conglomerates who have recognized the psychological makeup of most human beings in and figured out very intelligent ways to intentionally manipulate those human beings to become consumeristic so that they can gain at, uh, from, from these people's lack of education and understanding.

Speaker 6:          00:41:47       I think you're very educated. People are often consumeristic as well. I think consumerism is a byproduct of work and doing a lot of work that you don't really want to do. It makes, it makes you want to buy things when you go enjoy buying things when they work.

Speaker 4:          00:42:01       That's part of it. But this is like from this, I think we've talked about this before, the century of the south, about the, uh, what's called black psychology or the, uh, the, um, uh, using psychology been to manipulate people into buying shit or giving them

Speaker 6:          00:42:16       ration that they need something, right? So it's like, but it's an art form that they've almost got down to us

Speaker 4:          00:42:21       and it's a necessity. If you're going to have a successful economy in a capitalist country, you got to keep selling shit, right? You don't want to make something that's going to last forever,

Speaker 6:          00:42:30       but how do we regulate it? Do we do, we do, we just let it happen so that you can have preachers that you can have like those crazy guys on TV saying that if you send any money, I'll give you 10 times. Do we just let that happen? I mean, what, what if you were a, a few, we're inclined to decide, you know, if you had to cast your vote one way or another, what, how much do we limit? Well, no. Yeah. All right. I'm sorry. I just want to say like, because if that guy's not legitimate, okay, what if something comes along that is legitimate? What if there's some sort of sustainable new, a environment that's being built and they want everybody to throw some money in and become a part of it and uh, you know, and, and the offer you like a tangible deal and it's based on the same sort of spiritual concepts, you're going to automatically connect it with those other assholes. Well, no, I know. This is the prop man. I mean, this is, I can't stop it. You know what I'm saying? It's like you couldn't stop it because it, you would limit stopping it for a real pool. Going to

Speaker 4:          00:43:25       stop it too. Yeah. He was going to make the decisions. Who is going to say, no, no, no. This is the right thing and that's the wrong thing and this is good and that's bad. It's like, it's almost, uh, uh, I only an EGOMANIAC, whatever even consider the notion of trying to take charge, you know? And so it is this, you know, we, we ended up in this curious predicament of trying to determine, okay, well then how much do we let happen? For example, what's happening in Syria right now? How much do we let happen? How many more people get fucking bombed in this weird war between an oppressive regime and the people who are rising up? And it is an oppressive regime. The guy's been at, like, the guy's been around too long. The elections are fucked. It's, Siri has always been notoriously, it kind of fucked up place.

Speaker 4:          00:44:06       It's like now there's a civil war happening. So how much do we, who's it, who takes the side of, you know, right? Who takes the side of Assad? That's his name, right? Assad. What? Who takes his side? Who's really going to stand up for that fucking guy? You know what I mean? And, and, and I'll tell you one person who is Russia, you know what I mean? So Russia is standing up for this guy. Now we're in a weird situation. I don't know how much they're supporting, but the, that's where things get fucked up because it's like, okay, I guess we just back off and let a bunch of people get slaughtered because that's the way of the world. This is like, you know, the hardcore libertarians believe this. I think Ron Paul's like, this isn't our business.

Speaker 5:          00:44:44       Well, his, his also, his contention is that we've created a lot of business that we shouldn't have created. We've made things our business and things we've had blow back because of things that we've done that we shouldn't have been doing in the first place. The idea of a policing the world.

Speaker 4:          00:44:58       Yes, that's a problem. And we definitely split, put our fucking dicks and a great many Hornet's nest, but it's like the, the, the, uh, but if you look at it from like a perspective of just you, you're, you're getting your apartment, right? You're in your apartment and two doors away, someone starts screaming bloody murder, right?

Speaker 7:          00:45:15       He's fucking,

Speaker 4:          00:45:22       oh, Jesus. What do you do? What do you do? Are you going to fucking call nine one one? Of course you're going to try to help. To, maybe you're maybe going to go over there and see if you can fucking help this person. Right? So now all of a sudden there, let's spread the radius out, you know, two buildings down that's happening to someone. Now, let's spread it out more, you know, two miles away at a certain time, someone's going to get fucking hurt. How, when do you stop helping? Yeah. And right now it appears that when you stop helping [inaudible] is when it's outside the fucking, uh, boundaries of your country. At that point you're like, no, no, no, no, no, no. It is the way of the world that people are slaughtered by mortars in guns and executions and dragged into secret prisons. It's the way of the world.

Speaker 4:          00:46:04       And then it's a really weird fucking situation because it's like, well, it's also the way of the world to get people out of fucking secret prisons and to help people who are in trouble. You know, it's the story of our fucking, you know, our history, the damn the French helped us, you know, it's like sometimes people need help. When do you help? It's a real fucking question. It's a real, it's one of the big questions facing us right now. It's like when do you do something, you know, like if a in the UK, if they fucking storm into the equity, the embassy that Eh, the Ecuadorian embassy. Do you say? What does the Ecuadorian, yeah, they storm into that fucking thing. Breaking the sovereignty of Ecuador, which is essentially invading Ecuador if you go into a fucking awesome. Yeah. So in that case, obviously when they, if they just fucking start throwing out the whole game, yeah. Or that it's gotten where they're like, you know, we're just going to do what we want and what will for as long as it suits this will make it seem like there's laws in place here, right? Well, no, it comes down to it. We're going to fucking do what we want.

Speaker 5:          00:47:10       Isn't that kind of crazy that you got it like a whole building that's different country and that building has sovereignty in this cat can go there and say, can I get asylum? And they're like, yes. Good, cool. I'm staying here and now you're still like, wait, hold up and wait. He came mentioned with the stress of being in asylum.

Speaker 4:          00:47:27       Can you imagine the stress of being Julian? Uh,

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       it's a must be unbearable. I mean the guy, he's crazy, but he has a giant Paul's giant, giant, giant

Speaker 4:          00:47:37       dude. That guy's going to be remembered as one of the great heroes, man. That son of a bitch, that poor fucking bastard. Nobody. That guy made a real goddamn sacrifice cause like, I don't care how much money he was making from wikileaks. I don't care if he was making a fuck load of money for Wiki leaks, man. He knew when he wait, leak those documents. Do you realize like when you get that much fucking information that shows that some fucked up shit is going on. The moral responsibility to ethical you are responsibility you have at that moment. Because you know that the moment you wet this shit out, you're fucked. Right? Forget it. Forget it. Game over. You've made the decision like, all right, I'm going to fucking throw myself on the fire in this incarnation just because it feels better than sitting back and festering with the knowledge that there's fucking innocent people getting gunned down for no goddamn reason.

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       And that's being kept away from the people who are funding the fucking bullets blowing up their heads. You're like, God damn it, I've got to fucking do it. And you do it and you're a bad ass. And then you end up fucking hold up and the guy, a God damn embassy and you know that even if you do get out of that embassy, even if 50,000 Guy Fawkes mask wearing anonymous vigilantes, the send on that embassy all wearing the same outfit, swarm the fucking embassy and give you the outfit to wear so that you just mix in with all of them and vanish into the fucking, into the darkness and then end up in fucking Ecuador. You know, at one point there's going to be a moment when you wake up and there's the guy sitting next to your bad and he's like, hey man, I'm sorry but I got to fucking kill your ass. Or maybe it doesn't say anything or maybe they poison you or maybe there's a fucking moment when you walked down the street and you feel a strange prick in the bottom of your leg. And the next thing you know, you get a weird sickness, a form of fucking swine flu or some odd bacterial infection. You just fucking die.

Speaker 6:          00:49:23       So tell me more about what's going on in in Dallas. I, it's a West Nile outbreak, apparently nine people dive now there. When did this happen?

Speaker 4:          00:49:30       I don't know when the outbreak happened and I kind of like keep my eyes peeled for any kind of like end of the world style plague reports. But yeah, it seemed to pop out of nowhere. Just eight people in Dallas came down with West Nile

Speaker 6:          00:49:43       really recently. Yeah. Really recently. I dusted there. I think they're dusting today. Jesus Christ just spraying out that fucking poison, you know, because they don't want the West Nile virus to spread. Yeah. The Texas gets fucking funky hot man. And apparently I'm Aubrey said that they've had a record amount of days. They're, they're cruising on the, the, the current record, which is like some crazy number, like 50 something days of over 100 degrees, hottest fucking summer in history, man. It's weird, man. It's weird. You know, we were talking about, um, like lakes drying up and rivers are drying up and shit like that. Yeah. That's a, that's a disturbing thought, man. That, that the climate can shift

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       like really radically. Yeah. And it always has, always had, always had us, our ideas that we're going to be able to stay in this one spot that we so choose to set up shop in. That might be silly. There might be a silly thing to do. Yeah. It's like, as a species, we do this thing, same thing people do as an individual, like as a species, we make the silly, uh, like we have this crazy idea that everything's gonna stay the same. Yeah. The planet's gonna always be hospitable to our former life. And uh, we've just live with that. And the same way that from, you know, individuals go around like they're going to lift fucking forever. They go around treating people like shit, not returning phone calls, you know, they'd go around like being like complete conscious. Those, there's going to be something fun to treat people shit. Fucking, I don't return phone calls. No funny that is pissing my brother. Uh, all, all the horrible shit you could have said someone does like, yeah, people are fucking dog shit. I love returned. My brother is like, I love him very much. He's like one of my best friends on a fucking planet, but he's found somebody that he really loves and it's great.

Speaker 8:          00:51:32       It's really so he's like, he's like absorbed into this, this

Speaker 4:          00:51:39       beautiful thing that I'm very happy for him for it. But it's like that classic thing on one of your best friends gets a girlfriend. You're like, fuck, I understand. I've done it. God knows I've done it. I've been the king of that Shit, man. It's horrible. But the point is, people treat their lives, and I've tried, tried to do this last. Now sometimes people get caught up in like the, this, the minutia and they ended up, they end up, uh, uh, discounting their existence is though there's going to be some point 10 years from now, a lot of people think, okay, you know, I'm just going to fucking party through my twenties and then your 20s paths and then 30 seconds I got stills, got some juice in mistake, I'm going to just fucking do it through my thirties and then your thirties pass and now you're feeling a little tired and fucked up a little bit in your forties comment and you're like, under the forties, I'm going to settle down and I'm going to really become a man.

Speaker 4:          00:52:33       And then you just Keel over and die and that's it. You never fucking did you not, you never actualize yourself. You never jumped into the, you never jumped into the fucking fray. You know what I mean? So in the same way as a species, it's like we're, we're in that situation where we've, we think, yeah, well it'll be fine, man. There's infinite fucking resources. Woo. Come out. And it's, you know, and now, now we're kind of like in that part where you look in there, you flip the fucking hotel mirror a little bit and take a look at that pink moon sprout. And in you're in the back of your fucking head. What the fuck? There's a patch of pink. They're in the same way. There's like nice big thick, black, oily patches, a death sprouting up all over the planet from people logging and Dumping Chemicals in there.

Speaker 4:          00:53:16       And like, no, it'll come around that little fucking radioactive patch called Chernobyl. We'll come around. It'll be fine in a couple thousand years. You know what I mean? It's like I'm not even no Fukashima. We'll be fine. It'll be fine. That's not getting, that won't affect the rest of the planet. Why was it so crazy? Yeah, it's fucking crazy. So, so this is where we have this fucking problem, man, because we've got a group of people who believe that rabbits floated on rafts from one continent to the next. We've got a group of people who really fucking believe in some very archaic, primitive bullshit and we're really letting them run with it. Man. We're really letting them run with that. You're, you're supposed to, if you're polite, to allow them whenever craziness they believe without ever arguing it, ever discussing it or ever disagreeing with it. Yeah. And it's fun.

Speaker 4:          00:54:08       It's like, it's fine. Okay man. Fucking believe that shit. I don't care. I really don't care. And if it makes you happy, I really do mean God bless you and I'm happy. You're happy, that's fucking awesome. But if you're making political decisions based on these belief systems, well we got a fucking problem, man. We got a big fucking problem. Cause you're making political decisions based on an imaginary voice in your fucking head that thinks that a floating man's going to come down from space and this is a problem. This is a problem because the decisions need to be made on a more realistic human level, which is like, hey, there's a lot of people on this fucking planet. We, um, we, uh, we, we need to start working together and uh, and stop blowing each other up as crazy an idea is that may be, it's pretty much time to put down the Bible.

Speaker 4:          00:54:57       Let's put down the fucking Koran. Let's put down the, let's put down the old crusty old fucking scrolls and just treat it like we're living in a neighborhood. And let's see if we can fucking, um, let's see if we can just stop blowing each other up for a second. Iran, you don't need nuclear missiles. Iran, let's not make nuclear missiles and Israel, let's not fucking attack Iran right now. No, none of the people want to fight. None of the people want war. We don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want anybody to get fucking blown up. None of us want that man. Well, maybe like, maybe there's 3000 of us who want that. Maybe there's 3000 people who really are into it. And that's it. And there's a lot more of us than there are of them, you know. So at some point, something has to happen where a shift takes place, where people start, uh, prioritizing what's actually happening over what people dressed in funny outfits are telling us.

Speaker 4:          00:55:49       An invisible man is saying, we should do, you know, it's like so obvious. For example, if like you're in the woods and you get to choose between two guides, there's a guy wearing camouflage, he's like, got to fucking go Rambo knife and uh, uh, some fucking awesome tattoos. And then there's the guy who comes out dressed in a black fucking cloak holding a book and he's like, this is a magic book. This is my magic force book. And this book will give you all the answers you need in this giant, massive, deadly dangerous snake filled bear, written, forced. Do. Are you going to pick the guy with a magic book or the fucking the, um, the, yeah, we go with, okay, you go with the Kmo fucking guy. You go with the fucking Cammo guy. Maybe you take down the guy and the funny robe and steal his rubbed, make a Hammock, but you don't fucking, you don't fuck it up. You don't follow the guy with a funny book.

Speaker 6:          00:56:37       Well unless your brain doesn't work that good man, that's a problem. I think that one of the things that religion can do for people that really helps is it gives you an operating system and I think intelligent people use it that way and I think some really dumb people use it that way and if they didn't have it, they wouldn't know what to do and they might actually be a problem. I think it gives people an operating system and all though I don't agree with it. I think it's like I've described it as like religion being like scaffolding that it's like scaffolding for expanding consciousness. It allows you to have like some real solid shit that you don't have to think or worry about. Yes. And then concentrate on being positive, helping your brother being, you know, being a generous person. It's a vehicle, a vehicle for. And if you know you need stories or you know, scripture or whatever it is that you need to get you into that frame of mind that puts you on that good scaffolding,

Speaker 4:          00:57:33       this shit's encode it, man. It's, it's a fractal. There's deep information and all the scriptures. I certainly, um, I, when I,

Speaker 6:          00:57:41       they are all so different and the rules are so different, you know? That's true, man. I know some of them are just not into being happy, right?

Speaker 4:          00:57:49       Well, no, no. Well, yeah, we'll see what it is, is, it seems to be a, a problem of literalism, you know, it's like people are reading things and taking them literally and so, and not looking into the deeper levels of things. This is happening, um, uh, in every single aspect of our society, it seems that people are becoming more and more literal. They, they, they, the, the, their understanding of symbolism parody, that kind of stuff becomes a, it seems to be a little muddied right now. For example, the most recent thing that happened is, uh, as you know, I know, you know Daniel Tosh and the fucking rape fiasco for example, right? Yeah. Now Daniel Tosh, and I know this has been chewed gum on this show, but just the third podcast, oh, comedienne Chabay talking about it. These bastards. What a steal. I wired's the, the, um, the, uh, the, the, so the, so someone, when you make, when you deal with things on the surface level and you don't look deeper, well then you get into stupid wrestling, semantic wrestling matches with comedians over the most ridiculous ideas ever.

Speaker 4:          00:58:54       Instead of just like, yeah, he was like throwing something out there. He's not a rapist. He doesn't want to rape. Uh, he, he's just threw something out there. It's no problem. You know, the Depo, just a little, just three inches under the surface of that fucking thing. And it's a yawn. It's a yawn, mostly just like whatever. But like, um, on the surface it's fucking so important, so very fucking serious. So in the same way people take these very powerful scriptures, they interpret them on the on the level and they start arguing about the fucking surface level. So now when people are talking about the fucking garden of Eden, they're arguing over like who? Who was the bad guy? Was it eve or was it ad and well it was Eve's fuck cause she listed that darn old snake first. People really think that. They're like yeah it's the woman's fault.

Speaker 4:          00:59:41       That's what she got cursed with a painful child birth. And there's some of that in there, but it's like come on fuck heads, come on. Like if you say so then when you look at like when you get into the fucking Kabbalah and you look at the cobblistic tree of life and you see something that's taking the fucking idea of the tree of life in the garden of Eden and deepening it to like that, it really much deeper part of the fucking fractal where it's an expression of the expansion of nothingness into something that's in the universe and it's a cool metaphysical grid that shows the thing becoming aware of itself. Or a thing waking up and then becoming aware of itself, creating a triangle which flips over because it reflects itself into the universe and these are our, it's deep. It's heavy shit and you can, it's fucking awesome because this Kabbalah, that's the good, the cobblistic

Speaker 5:          01:00:29       tree of life and then assist the stuff that you're not supposed to even read until you hit like 36 or some shit like, yeah, that's what they say. I mean, I don't know. I don't go to the Kabbalah Center or anything. I just remember reading Alice to Crawley and he's got like some fucking snake sound to confirm your allegiance with Satan. You're a grown man. Oh, let me tell you I, I've used it as son. I found myself his name from time to time, just for the fuck of it and hang out and feel good. Hang over. You go hang over. You feel like a vampire vampire is look like right? They look at, they're hung over. Like when the sun comes up, they do. They look fucking what a weird idea is that sometimes you can have vampires that fall all the vampire rules. Until real recently people got so fucking arrogant.

Speaker 5:          01:01:16       They were like, well, no, no, no. Now Vampires are actually your friend and they only eat deer and they don't burn. When it's sunny out. They just glisten and they don't want to be glistening. They sparkle Joe. They don't glisten. They sparkle. Just vampires all of a sudden became cool and you could fuck them. Oh yeah. Well that's Andrew Rice's fault. Right? And rise or fall. Oh my God. The fucking interview with a vampire. I don't think so man. Because even before interview with the Vampire, Dracula was very sexual. The Dracula was a hypnotic. Yeah, he was a very sexual and like a lot of the older movies, you know, there was a few of the Gary Oldman. What came first? Gary Oldman or Anne Rice? Probably in rise, right? I don't want Gary Oldman Dracula. I think Anne Rice, I'm always positive actually. Well,

Speaker 4:          01:02:01       no, the fucking old Dracula, I think the, the Brahms Stoker Dracula. Oh that was so long that some traps and the castle didn't he have like there was a room you went into and there are all these female vampire is running hot. Is there a car? Yeah and like they were seductive and would like, you know,

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       they would know how riffle Dracula, that's the good part of that where everyone is hating on Dracula. It's got these hard pitches that want to suck blood. They're ready to throw it out. It just gets the bone him. He never bound them in front of you buddy though. It was just, I guess once you start drinking people's blood that's like way cool with him. The one in checks just completely give up on bowling. I mean in the world of vampires it's that is boning the best track though of all time. Unquestionably. It was Gary Oldman. Did you see that one? I don't. Bram stoker I got so it's so good that Keanu Reeves can't fuck it up. I got it like I don't know cause I haven't seen it, but I'll tell you my favorite fucking vampire by the way. I do like Keanu Reeves. It's just as cheap joke. I like canneries. It's cheating. It's the Joe. I love you can, I love God. I love you. Didn't pay attention to my joke. He just went in and say, what are you going to say?

Speaker 6:          01:03:09       Here's where my mind started wandering is you said the greatest vampire and then I thought, no, no, no. The greatest vampire of all time, the spookiest vampire of all time is fucking Nosferatu. Oh, the original. Yeah, you're right. Fuck that thing. We'll also, that was like really original. I mean, and think about that guy did that. It was like, wow, this is a silent movie. No Man, that thing was a scary son of a bitch was like, that's what a vampires like the long fingers kind of gobbling, just as creepy thing pops out of the shadows that talks. I do keep talking. I love it. Sorry my, my yapping too much. Oh, I love it. Oh you do? Really? Yeah, man. Yeah, man. That guy's fucking scary. But you know, the Salem's lot vampires are pretty fucking spooky to 1922 brother 1922 and I'm looking at the images of it right now.

Speaker 6:          01:04:05       Oh my God. It's, it's fucking incredible. It is legitimately frightening. Legitimately frightening. And it was in the fucking early 19 hundreds, dude rentable. And they find fucking coffin stilted. You know, they found coffins out there where people have hammered stakes into the Oh yeah. Well there's probably, I'm sure people that were fucking assholes and they just wanted to make sure that really never came back. But this motherfucker was creepy. You're right, man. You know, he might be the scariest one ever. Yes. Especially when you consider it was 90 fucking years ago. Yeah. Man, that was fucking spit. Well, I mean, that was based on the real thing. Whatever was wandering around out in the fucking woods of Germany. That's what was out there. What a crazy people. Do you remember? Uh, it was, uh, it was based on a real man. The, Oh my God, look this fucking photo of it, dude.

Speaker 6:          01:04:55       It's a really good God damn image that they're really fucking scary looking. Yeah, that's a scary vampire. 1922 because if you go wash like King Kong, King Kong is not really scary. And that's a little from like the 30s. Nope, not scary at all. And that's scary. It can con can, cannot fuck with Nosferatu. No, not, I mean, I guess if I had to pick who I wanted to run from, it's going to be a fucking Nosferatu though. But I weird. Is it that they just hijacked the whole vampire thing? Vancouver is used to be the worst shit that could ever happen to you and now he's a hunky guy. Well, I'll tell you why they fucking did that ship. Rather we in it. Yeah. You got to sell it to teenagers. It's women, men, lot of women Wa people that want that want romance. The A, the thing about the twilight books, so I've been told by Mrs Rogan, uh, is that the very romantic, unrealistically romantic because he's a vampire and it's like he's got all the super power and everything like that.

Speaker 6:          01:05:53       It's like he, like he's giving it all up, but just to be with her, you know what I mean? And it's this weird sort of like, he, he needs her so much and women love that shit. It's just a natural sort of a thing for though. So like when you see like women that would be waiting in line to go to those movies, that just, it just hits a chord that we don't, we don't have, we don't know that court, but the who wrote that shit and I was their cord so she nailed it. Love. I'm talking about the court of affection and admiration. Like I think all women want to be, you know, they want to be worshiped, you know, they think that that's like the most romantic thing for a guy who would do anything for you. So he would do anything for that girl in, in, in those books he would do anything for, I mean, he, he didn't even want to bite her.

Speaker 6:          01:06:41       He wanted, uh, you know, he wanted to protect her from everybody who was in love with her. Meanwhile, he was like a thousand years old and she's in high school. Like, it's really fucking creepy if you stop and think about it. He's a thousand years old or whatever the fuck it is. I tell area she's in high school, man. You're fucking crazy kind of conversations you're having with her. Jesus Christ. I mean, it'd be hard enough if you were 30, you were 30 and you're dating a girl in high school, you'd be like, I got to kill myself. I can't take it. I can't talk to her. She's fucking just shows. All she wants to talk about is Instagram thousand old. You fucking creeper. He's a total creeper. She could be as Greg Greg. It's not like he just was frozen for all those years. Like captain America. No, this asshole's been alive the whole time and uh, pretended he's in high school.

Speaker 6:          01:07:29       It might be one of the dumbest ideas ever. It's not fair. He's got magical powers. He can fly. He's flying a fucking high school kid through the trees. Jesus Christ. Did they fuck yes. Eventually. Yeah. Later in the boiler spoiler. Yes. Allegedly. How about that? I don't know. It was, it already happened. It might have already happened. I only saw like two of them. I think there's been three of them. Put it in her asshole. I don't think vampires a lot to do that. It's a sin. Even for Vampires. I think we've vampires. No, no, no female that go cut the shirt. Just stop it. They don't even shit anymore, so probably drives up nice, don't shit. When you're eating blood, they probably barely a urinal dude. You probably get the exact amount you need. You don't know that. I would imagine you would get to the exact amount you need now, man of vampires.

Speaker 6:          01:08:23       Asshole is swollen. Broken a scene where you walk down into a New York City subway and you saw some crazy looking vampire dude, you're shitting blood. Just blood squirting out of his ass. Chunky cottage cheese blood. That's what a vampire he looks like a tunnel, a subway title, just shitting blood, looking at you and thinking about sucking your blood next. It's weird that they're like, that's that. That's as far as they go. Like vampires, suck your blood. That's the worst thing I do. But there's never been like a supernatural creature that walked that like mouth fucks you. You know what I mean? Some we talked about that before. You know, he really, as ridiculous as it is, I think we actually did talk about this before. It must be on my fucking mind, man. There's no fucking bat or some creepy for rapes people. That was mouth rape and dudes.

Speaker 6:          01:09:15       I don't use that word. A fucking horrifying, horrifying being. It doesn't have to be a vampire. It could just be some bug, some insect or something that came out of the earth and that's how it does it. It just fucking, it leaves off of the, it lives off of like people gagging. That's it absorbs the energy of gagging. It gets power for the trip. The twitching of your body when you're trying to throw up, it's a gag. Pyre pipe is clogged by a fat cock and you can't even throw up. You're trying to throw up and he's just holding the back of your head was Scaly Paul.

Speaker 6:          01:09:53       That's what they came to do. They just came to get head. They have like really tough dicks, like you really cannot even pierce the skin. You can bite it as hard as you want. It doesn't matter when alien's face fuck you. They just did. It just goes in. You accept it and it, it just fucks your throat when you try and throw up. But he can't get past the fat alien cock that's stretching your insides out, pumping oxygen. And by the way, it's keeping you alive in your life. It changes your whole, it blows your lungs out and actually eats them and uh, converts it to a type of glue that keeps the cock attached to your body to keep you alive. Cause now you no longer have lungs. You get all your oxygen through his cock.

Speaker 6:          01:10:43       Oh my God. Could you imagine? That would be the word. And some people would say, you know what? I don't care. I love aliens anyway. There's still all Sarah teaching us. Listen, if for him might be really awesome. Maybe he loves the fact that he's getting the oxygen to that cock. You stay alive, your body where there's a way I can't really move. Your arms are flailing and like in paled, you just look like a skeleton with a fucking Gildo in its mouth and every year it just goes deeper in your body, keeps debt growing. Eventually it turns into the age is turning it like a Cactus, like cactus Dick thing. Yeah. If you look at sugar, Barb shish Kebab, Dick Kebab, every year the, the, the s the dick slowly grows inside your body and starts cracking open Oregon's and pushing ribs to the side, popping them and snapping them as it eventually goes through your body.

Speaker 6:          01:11:34       But it does it so slowly that you never actually die, especially since the, uh, the deck is providing with oxygen, but then when it gets to the head, to the end, the deck pops out of your asshole and you deflate like a balloon. And that, and that sound is that sound is known as fumbling. Like it's like the sound of a man's final. Fom there's no words sound. It's like a cute, I mean, that's not any weirder than a lot of shit that's real. It's not any weirder than those aquatic worms that just stayed inside of grasshoppers and committing, get them to commit suicide so they can be born. That's an and that's enough. No, man, this is this. I know. It's not that fucking weird and not weird at all. Right? But it's like we don't, the closest to harder movement course. It's weird, but it's the weirdest thing. But it's not any more weird than like cordyceps mushrooms that grow inside ants heads and then explode and spray the air and affect all these other ants to become zombies.

Speaker 4:          01:12:28       Fucking Nah, I god Damn my bane. Ling's God bless you. Starcraft two our is, I love you. Um, it turns, it turns him into bombs, right? It turns into fucking, uh, bombs. That's a fungal bomb. Yeah, it's crazy. Um, uh, yeah dude, fucking the, the nature is insane man. And like I sometimes I think about that notion of the fungal consciousness and factor, the thing that like, uh, you know, the, I know, we know this is chewed gum, cause I know we've talked about toxoplasmosis for example. I had to describe that today to Everlast. I'd explained to him about cats. But Dude, if you take this the next level, you know, this is where we get into the realm, the metaphysical realm that, um, a lot of people believe that, you know, you can get fucking possessed by a spirit, right? And this is not just fucking Christians.

Speaker 4:          01:13:17       This is like an, almost every religion has this notion that uh, I think you can get into you and start fucking controlling you. And it's like, man, if it's, if there's fuck, you know, maybe there's this embodied beings that really can like get inside you, you know, maybe, maybe just certain ideas. Is it maybe like certain ideas? I think, um, what's his name? Stein or someone was just telling me he believed the ideas were alive. Right? And so, ah, what if there are certain ideas that someone can implant into your head? That's the exact same thing as being possessed. You know what I mean? So you get this fucking idea and it just grows inside of you. Much like our legendary Dick Alien. It grows inside of you and turns you into a fucking different person. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:14:04       Is it hard? There are certain people that are so susceptible to ideas and words that they can get them in their head and obsess on them. The point of almost

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       like madness. Yes. I had a friend who had a, a nervous breakdown while he was hosting a show where there was a, a a black gentleman who was the actor in the show, very famous guy. And as he's, um, he's warming up the crown Brody Stevens style, he gets this thought in his head that he can't get out and the thought is don't say nigger, don't say, Nigga, whatever you do, don't say that he could, he would never say it. He's not a racist by any stretch of the imagination. It was just madness. Yeah. So we had a complete nervous breakdown while he was doing stand up, while he was warming up on some Hollywood sound stage and he just had a nervous breakdown. He just, he couldn't not think of not saying that word, so it would just completely fucking freaked them out to the point where he froze and he couldn't get any words on. People were concerned about him. They were looking at him like, is he okay? Like he just stopped in mid sentence and everyone's listening to him. He's got a microphone. He just locked the fuck up with. And I was like, wow. Oh. It was like, what is that like

Speaker 4:          01:15:14       possessed by an idea. The idea possessed them and took over his body and there's other versions of this idea, you know, whatever the fucking idea is that gets in someone's head and makes them think that a solution to a problem is the wrap explosives around their body and go wandering into a fucking cafe. That person's got a bad idea. That's a bad idea inside their head. That's a bad thing. Living inside their head. Yeah, it's a bad idea. And it's like, there's a lot of fucking people on the planet. You've got some bad ideas and their fucking heads, man. Yeah. You know, but you know, they're just, I suppose whether they're living or not, it's just a device to like help understand the spread of the thing. And this spreads more like a virus. Ideas spread more like a virus than they do anything else.

Speaker 4:          01:15:55       Right. They fucking take over a person. They get into its subjective DNA. They transform its thought patterns and then not being begins to infect those around it with the similar ideas. And then that spreads the fucking thought disease out through it through the world. Do you know? Right. And that that's like going on right fucking now. Right. God Damn Chick-Filet I'm going to go around at chick filet and eat some fucking chicken sandwiches to show my love for Jesus. Yeah. Right. You know, and, and, and like that's a Vr, you know, that's the, a flower growing from the tree of an idea that's been planted in the minds of many people. Um, you know, the fundamentalists and it's like, fuck man, what if it is a living thing? What if they're actually possessed by a living force that is not that great? It's just like that fungal things in, in the answer the tree.

Speaker 5:          01:16:47       That's interesting. That's an interesting way of looking at it that these ideas are actually living things. Yeah. I mean it, it might be, who knows? I mean it's, it is very strange when you think about the direction that our society goes and, and then it does seem to be led to and fro by like really saying shit upon occasion and Saint Saint Saint Shit. And you're like, wait a minute,

Speaker 6:          01:17:09       what are you doing? Because she did what she danced. What, what? This is your, this is your belief. You know, you get a line, a woman up in the middle of the street and throw rocks at her because someone caught her dating a member of the wrong Muslim tribe. Yes. Oh my goodness. It gets, it gets weird man. Really scary. Weird. Well, it gets fucking weird because I mean goddamn the first fucking when, when, when the first monkey decided to come down out of the tree and wander out and start fucking hunting, you know, I don't know. I don't know. But I, I'm pretty sure that the other fucking monkeys that decided to stay in the fucking tree and in this situation, I'm not saying one group is a monkey and one group's not. I'm saying we're, I'll fucking monkeys. But the ones that decided to stay up in the Goddamn tree didn't have nuclear weapons.

Speaker 6:          01:17:52       You know that's about the nuclear sub that was sneaking around off the coast of Mexico. Shared Ed right down near San Diego. Russian, right? Yeah. Having a little fun Russian nuclear sub gut right up next to us. Just a slight, you know, bitch, Holla and sneak up on you. Armed with warheads. Sure. Easy. It was a real legitimate nuclear submarine. Check it out. What the fuck? That wasn't a message. Oh my dear. I guess they're there for awhile. We didn't know they were there. I guess my gps was off. I ended up off the coast of San Diego. Most of the symmetrical, most of the bullies are onstar malfunction. Malfunction gps. Yeah. How crazy is that? There was a war ship. The other superpower that wants to get bigger and better. What's he? He's run by criminals. Here's where we come to the fucking, you know the, the, the, the thing that mechanic kept talking about, he's like, look, we don't have time to teach people and meditate anymore.

Speaker 6:          01:18:57       People are possessed by this fucking idea. We can teach people to meditate, but first they need to get super high on a psychedelic. You know what I mean? Like there needs to be this, there's like this imperative to transform those fucking crazy thoughts, structures that are floating around in people's heads, um, because they've got fucking nuclear weapons. Thanks Fran. You can't just climb out of the Goddamn tree. Now, you know, if you climb out of the fucking treat, people are going to say you're a goddamn heretic. You know, they're your, you're a Goddamn anti American heritage. Listen to me say there's no fucking Jesus Christ and the God damn rabbits got across the fucking ocean in some way that didn't involve floating on logs. You're obsessed with this rabbit and the ocean thing. Well, they didn't say rabbits, but I just picture that I just said animals. I don't know. I don't know that spread of rabbit throughout the planet. I'm not floating around on logs. Oh yeah. But some of those four, you know what else is apparently everywhere on the planet? Sasquatch.

Speaker 6:          01:19:54       Yeah. Well, yeah, you fucking laugh, dude. But I'm going to squash. You're getting known as a a Sasquatch believer that's happening to you. I'm down, I'm steady squatch and look man, if you ever watched the show finding bigfoot? No, I just got a TV. I had bobo from finding big foot on the podcast was awesome. He gave me a, uh, a cast is a cast over there. I'll show it to ya. Foot giant foot hat. Does he believe it? Oh fuck yeah. He believes it. He said he's seen it. He said he's seen it, man. You know, it's really creepy though. Really? Northern California, that whole area, it's called like Ape Canyon, Ape River Monkey Canyon. It's like all these like weird fucking names and involve primates, but it's not a place where there's any apes. It's really strange. There's a lot of sightings in one area, a lot of sightings for the last couple of hundred years and it's a really densely wooded area.

Speaker 6:          01:20:47       It doesn't mean that they're not bears and people aren't on mushrooms. It's totally possible that it also could have been just an idea that one person had and they ran with it and it fucking carried on as almost a tradition. Okay. Not to take this idea too far, but fucking mechanic talked about the idea that the Ufo is some kind of projection of the Mystere of the mystery of novelty, of the something within humans or something in fucking hyperspace. I think that was young. Yeah. Carl Young. Carl Young, maybe Makino has quoting young. Yeah. It's um, aliens and Ufos and archetypes. I forgot I forgot the book, but he wrote a whole book on that concept that the, uh, the Ufo was almost like a, a ghost of our imagination. So maybe this is probably a terrible way of describing it. Maybe this is a ghost of our imagination. It's a kind of specter that rises up out of the deepest parts of ourselves or our potential and manifest is like, this is what we could be, or this is me. Have you ever seen a real UFO footage or real photo that you were like, yes, I'm, I'm, I, I have seen pictures, but every single picture is always fucked up. They had a new Saas coach picture and all they got is his back. Crystal clear and focus is bad.

Speaker 6:          01:22:05       Yeah. One shot man, you sons of bitches. All right. But it's not saying that there's not a real animal and the reason why I say that as Jane Goodall, Jane Goodall, so she was 100% convinced. All the people should talk to that at the same story and all the same side of things. If there was an undiscovered primate in the Pacific northwest, I have no problem. I mean, it's never, it's not anything that fucking wood. I think it'd be really awesome if somebody finally like caught one of those things, but it wouldn't, like, it's not going to make me fucking any happier when I wake up in the balloon would make me happier. I love it. I'm like a little kid. I'd be so happy, but I think what the fuck do I know about primates? A lot of what I know about primates came, they learned from Jane Goodall.

Speaker 6:          01:22:46       So for me to like pretend that I know more about primaries and Jane Goodall just seems ridiculous. So Jane Goodall says there's a climbed without doing too much research, I'm inclined to believe it. You know, I mean Jane Goodall is, she's a bad ass bad ass lady. The lady scholarly lady. Thank you. But she's um, may I ask you a question for show me good off. Sean. You think she ever humped one of those for sure. Yeah. Fuck the shit out of at least one. Just to see what was up. Maybe that's what kept her all those years. I think a lot of those ladies that they want it, fucking chimps. Chimps have big dicks. You know, it has that big Dicks, gorillas, gorilla girls, a little tiny decks. You know why no one is trying to fuck their girls. Look at the size of them. Jesus Christ, the gorillas, the back's the smart ones.

Speaker 6:          01:23:34       You think about what they are. They're these giant, enormous but peaceful vegetarian gorillas. It's like nature just made them so big. So you leave them the fuck alone and it works so good that they can have a Harem. So they have a heroin. There's no need to grow a big deck. He's not about the size of your Dick. You don't have to impress these chicks. They're yours. Go ahead and get that one. So they have like these little tiny dicks. I'm like an inch long. They're always fallen out. The grill is a terrible fucking Christopher Ryan, the author of sex at dawn talks about this. He was telling me about this. I really, how gorillas have a fucking tiny little dicks because they have a hair. Yeah, it's exact. There's no like competition to grow like big cocks. It's one thing else. All chimps have huge balls too.

Speaker 6:          01:24:17       It's all chimps. Chimps have sluts, female chimps just taking dick all over the place. So the mail chimps, their ball swell disproportionately with sperm, depending upon how much, uh, promiscuity is in their clan. So if everybody's fucking, everybody that balls are giant and they're just ready to shoot loads on a drop of a hat. You got to be ready to fuck one of these crazy bitches whenever we can hold them down, that is banging each other left and right. Especially like Benobos. They're the craziest animal ever. They have sex to, to uh, get over arguments. They like men and men that this is the women and women. One of the premises in this book, which is the Banabos are closer to us than champs, are equally distant and you can ask them genetically. So it's like, and, and they fuck missionary position. They look in each other's eyes when they're humping. Yeah. I think there's some odd lesbians shit that happens out there and there and just sexually promiscuous. They, yeah, it's a social, it's a way to solidify social bonds through humping. They do everything except the mother does it. Fuck the sun. That's it. That's where they draw the line. But other than that, that's how they resolve issues. Father Fox, daughter, father fucks daughter, uh, brothers fuck sisters. Oh, but the mom does not fuck the sons. Nope. Yeah, it's strange. Or they got something right.

Speaker 6:          01:25:39       That's step one, bitches. Next try shoes that never going to evolve because they have the fucking thumbs on their feet and they want to fly around the trees. They're not going to lose that. Why would you lose that? That's the most awesome thing ever. Flying around in the trees is way better than any cool shit that we can do on the ground, you know? So for them to like develop cars and all that other shit, you gonna have to spend a lot of time just walking around with shoes on. Well no man, this is where we get into the IBM. First of all, man, I love the fucking idea. A monkey starting to wear shoes that would, that would make me wake up happy to start off with catcher's Mitts. How cute would that be? Like you see film of like monkeys, like in the cute little sandals that they've made at a Bush baby who can't.

Speaker 6:          01:26:17       Do you think it would work? I wonder if it would work. Sure. I wonder if I could wear a men walk around all catcher's Mitts on. Sure. They could wear anything he could wear. Fucking does tee shirts, helmets. And God damn boxing gloves, it'd be the best. What would, what do you think we would do if we walked in and chimps in the jungle and they were making shoes and we're tying their shoes on? No, no, not even weapons to shoes. We'd we shoot them. No, we'd weep with joy because it would be the cutest thing anyone ever saw. And also you'd be on the front page of Reddit. Like yes, it would be totally on the front page or when it would explode. And also it'd be like, you know, it'd be kind of like, um, uh, really spooky thing. Like, which is this idea that maybe evolution itself is accelerating and all beings, not just in fucking technol technology, but like, it's like hitting everything.

Speaker 6:          01:27:12       It's starting to speed up everywhere where those gorillas popping those fucking poacher traps. You know what I mean? Like maybe shit's happening everywhere is speeding up and speeding up and all think where things are suddenly going to just start like talking, wearing fucking shoes, talking and cute English accents. For people who don't know, the girls are figured out a way to disarm traps. They know, they figured out the mechanism behind the trap. So that triggered the trout to working together. It's really fascinating. Really fascinating. They figured out a way to communicate their idea and they uh, they took out some traps. Yeah. I mean, what would we do? What would we do if they started evolving? What would they do with, they started developing weapons, you know, if you came into the jungle, then you found chimps and they were holding on to spears with Flint tips.

Speaker 6:          01:27:55       What the fuck do you do? You know, what do you do that gets crazy? And what if they're just using it to hunt? They just use it at the hunt within one day. One tells a dog, you know, steals a dog in Africa or somewhere and the next thing you know, it's on the war. Could you imagine if they actually did evolve? What if chimpanzees, this is a fucking stupid idea, strap in, but if you listen to Mckenna's idea, Mckenna's idea of the stoned ape theory was that there was a period of human history that scientists are a little bit confused about it. And that period is over 2 million years. The human brain doubled and they don't know why. They really don't know. There's all sorts of thoughts, you know, like the throwing arm like that. We figured out how throw shit and kill things that accelerated our use of tools and the rain just kept up with what, you know, what we needed. And then the other, the craziest one is Mckenna's idea. Mckinnis idea was that it was because of mushrooms, is that we had, uh, started coming down off the trees because the climate was changing and that the rain forests were receding in the Glock grasslands and that these animals flipped over these cow patties looking worms and shit

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       that they would eat. And then they found the mushrooms on the top and they started eating the mushrooms and then they started experiencing enlightenment. They started having creative ideas. They started developing language. I want, why hasn't someone just taking some champs and giving them some mushrooms? Why? Why don't they try that? Why don't they, I mean, if you're willing to try lipstick on them and let's see if this perfume is fucking toxic. When we Turkey shoot it up your ass. Yeah. You know, they'll do all that to champs. They do testing on chimps from medicine and they die. They, it's, they do hard shit to them. They cut their heads off and see if they can keep on fat allegedly. Um, but why I get the mushrooms. Could you imagine what if they could show we've been doing this for 45 years. We'd go to some fucking bunker in Nevada right out and groom lake like these, these are the chimps that we have developed through our mushroom program and they look like cave men. Yeah. Could you imagine we've had him for 36 years. This is where the, and they look like,

Speaker 4:          01:29:55       man, that's, if that's the, I mean if, if only we could have whatever that fucking beam that they had and I star Trek that genesis ray or whatever, that makes shit of all faster because to me makin his idea of the Proto Hominids chomping on those mushrooms was that, um, it happened of course over a long, long time, 2 million years, 2 million years. Cause it create and, and, and like, it's like mushrooms at low doses. This is the other thing he mentioned in his theory, his mushrooms at low doses, man, they're great for fucking dude. They're great for having sex. They're like, they really like, it's if you take the right dose it's real. It's an aphrodisiac. Yes. So like his idea was um, yeah, so there's, it's like, it also improves visual acuity and the peripheral, which so you can see a goddamn wine sneaking up on your ass

Speaker 5:          01:30:47       peripheral. But they said that they've done tests on where they have two parallel lines and a one parallel line will move very slightly offline. And when we you, you can recognize it quicker on psilocybin than when you're, when you're straight. Weird. Yeah. Um, I forget who, what the scientist was. Who did that? I should know. I should remember that. What it was, uh, one of the, uh, the things that Terence had as a part of his theory, but nobody ever took his theory seriously after everybody got completely mocked and made fun of it. Because mushrooms are like an inherently silly thing. Have you say you've done them, where you think they're important year immediately. An idiot. Silly

Speaker 4:          01:31:27       sub. And what'd you, what'd you go to? A grateful dead concert and dance on a tapestry. God Damn Hippie. But what's amazing, it's like, it can be responsible for one of the most powerful reconsiderations of your life ever. Like a real true religious experience. Yeah. And we're all holding back on all this shit. None of those were trapped in this wonky culture. We're all sort of at least partially got the brakes on when it comes to that stuff. No, they got the brakes on us. We don't have the brakes. The brakes aren't on that. We got conditioned. The Reagans put a lot of fucking money into that Shit, man. Like this wasn't like, uh, the administration, of course, not the family, but this was like the, you know, this is the pharmacological inquisition as they say. Yeah. And uh, it all stems back to the, uh, distribution of LSD through the United States.

Speaker 4:          01:32:15       Starting with the CIA's experiments does eve, they had a truth serum serum. And um, the, you know, the ways I get it, what psychedelic is due to society is that they fucking meltdown the boundaries. And when boundaries meltdown, it causes a shift. And that shift is not work very well for the way we've run our society for a very long time. And so they recognize that and they stop that shift because it, um, it's not, but it's important to realize that these brakes are being put on by people outside of us. I mean, if you look at shamonic cultures and the Amazon, you know, these are, this is a indogenous part of their daily life. It's embedded into their culture. It's as normal as having fucking telephones. You know, it's a way to communicate with nature. So this is like, you know, a very essential aspect of being a human being is taking a psychedelic, um, um, has been for a very long time. Uh, and you know, whether or not Mckenna's right about the neo cortex expanding and when Proto Hominids chomp mushrooms, one thing is for certain,

Speaker 5:          01:33:26       once we found out about it, we indulged. What do you mean? I mean that's for certain, yeah. Once we found out about it, people have been using them forever. Bingo. Yes, yes, yes, exactly.

Speaker 4:          01:33:36       Glee. And we know from our own personal experience with him that the effect is not some kind of like, um, ridiculous, uh, a frat party giggle fast. It's like if you take the right dose and you do it with the right people and you do it with the right intention, then there will be a massive shift in your consciousness. It can do a form of ego death, which allows you to heal and allows you to reacquaint yourself with kind of a living, connective energy that isn't all things. And um, that's an eight. That's a very important experience to have.

Speaker 5:          01:34:09       But it's amazing how all the propaganda worth considering how substantial the effect of the product is, that it's suppressed. This incredible, you know it, I mean you would say that in an open market, eventually the cream rise to the top, but it doesn't get a chance because it's cut off and because it's illegal and demonized this incredible, I dunno whatever you would call it, experience that's called, that it's incredible experience is kept away from you. It's kept away from what is essentially a natural experience by eating some things that people have eaten since the beginning of time and it's kept from you and it's, it's a shame. It's a shame that you can live your whole life without understanding that there might be some other aspects to this life that we also need to take into our body in order for us to get a better grasp on things. And they might have aided getting us to here and we might be in a sick, sick

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       time where we're not using these things. And that's what's responsible for this whole chaotic community. That we have this whole chaotic thing or we're polluting the skies and polluting the ocean and you know, we, we will do anything for profit, including invade other countries were doing all sorts of really insane twisted things that are the types of things that would be happening if we were sick. If there was something wrong with us, if we weren't getting our medicine, if we weren't getting, we were weren't getting what got us to the dance. Right? Yeah man. If that's true, if that's true, if the human consciousness really did develop through psychedelics, it only makes sense that we fucking need that shit. Just like we need meat. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:35:41       It's a vibe. It's almost like a vitamin or it's like it's not a psychic vitamin. And in the same way that way back when, during right after the agrarian revolution, when people are getting less nutritional value because of droughts and they became amazing, aided and small, and you can look at skeletons of people back then, they're much smaller, right? Cause they weren't getting the nutrition in the same way. We are amazing. [inaudible] but in a, in a psychic way. So you end up with these people or these, it was just broken fucking psychic egos.

Speaker 6:          01:36:09       Pro Wrestling fans. Hey, he fucking pro wrestling. No Bro. I fucking love pro wrestling and I love your show too. I love you too. I'm just kidding. Is this a joke? Yeah, I got nothing. It's progressing, man.

Speaker 4:          01:36:20       Take it. I'll take 700 fucking stadiums of pro wrestling fans over one Phelps family. You know what I mean? Let's talk about that.

Speaker 6:          01:36:27       That was Fox man. You know crazy. God hates fags guy. They're insane. When you say fell up, so you have to be careful cause it's right after the Olympics. You know, people would say, what the fuck did Michael Phelps to? Oh, you know, you might have fucking pig felt. Jesus Christ, that guy. How does your race swim so fast? He's not even like a human man breaks the laws. Did you see the onion headline that Michael Phelps returned to as aquarium in New York? Like he lives in acquirement and sea world. I mean, or when he goes to the beach, he was like, no fucking way. I'm getting in that water and he's like, I've been in water so much, I am not fucking swimming. Like he doesn't ever swim in the ocean. He's like, I'm just sitting in the sand. Chelan I don't blame. I mean fuck dude.

Speaker 6:          01:37:07       That guy's like, how many gold medals did that guy won more than anybody ever. It's like in 20 or some shit. Something nuts. He moves so well. It's incredible. I mean it's just like from an aesthetic point of view or a, you know, from an, even in an artistic part of you, you, you're, you're looking at it and it looks like art. It looks like he's like, it looks like a dance in, there's so much flow to it. Yeah. As he's like fucking hurling through the water. Yeah. It's so the, they move so fast that it's hard to believe, but it is almost, I mean if dance, I mean if it really, if dance is impressive, isn't that impressive? Just as well. I think it's an impressive physical feat in to a rhythm. The way they can swim to a rhythm and then they'd go under and then they show underwater flight this long period before they bust open and start whipping it again. What a crazy fucking sport man.

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       Wild to watch. Wild to watch people do some shit that you just cannot fucking do. To know that. That's like the capabilities of the human frame. Yeah. If it's that long and that strong and that young and that dedicated and it puts in this many hours every week, look what the fuck this thing.

Speaker 4:          01:38:10       Yeah. It's pretty amazing. Ooh, it's pretty amazing. All this stuff, they can happen and, and, and physically, mentally what you can learn, the things that you can figure out. It's amazing the, uh, the amount that you can send your consciousness out into the universe and understand things. It's a fucking incredible, you know, th th this, yeah. This, this space suit that we're in. It's like, it's got all these like a parts to it that we forgotten how to use. You know, almost like some survivor of a spaceship crash has amnesia and isn't this super advanced spacesuit and only uses like parts of it, you know, little parts of it to like amble around. Right, right. And it's like, no man, there's like crazy fucking circuit boards that you can access in this fucking thing. But you know, you need help. There's certain fuels that you need to like make that connection and those fuels are fucking, if you're an athlete, you got to eat the right food.

Speaker 4:          01:39:05       You know, you can't just chomp on guide. Damn Froot loops and Cheetos and ended up like being a professional, a Olympic swimmer. They've got their feeding. Those people like crazy. We don't even know. Probably glows smells like calm cause is special nutritional like blast that they just spray into their mouths like fog roghey's there's fucking like, you know, God only knows what these fuckers have in their bodies. And in the same way for your intelligence, you know, for your, for your spiritual growth, you need to take into your fucking being certain at certain things. Great scriptures, incredible writing. And on occasion, a nice fucking mushroom trip, you know, but you gotta be careful, you know, you gotta be careful not to like, I feel guilty saying this stuff because some people are, aren't, you're not supposed to take it. You shouldn't take it. You're in a bad part in your life right now. You're fucking balls smell like at the bottom of a God damn fucking the bottom of a, a donkey's ass. You know, you got to clean your balls and clean yourself and your life up before you take the experience. You know, some people shouldn't do it, but some people definitely should. You definitely should. It's very important. God Damn. Just one on a hippie rent and my friend Steve Jobs though, I mean, come on, like you said, that fucking LSD was like one of the biggest, uh, one big part of his understanding of the universe.

Speaker 5:          01:40:31       Yeah. I think we had a world filled with people of all had breakthrough psychedelic experiences and they were running this, this country. It'll be a lot easier as long as they got enough pussy to keep them satisfied. Yes, we just had robot concubines or whatever. People would think it would be morally acceptable, keep them sexually satisfied so they don't go tweak in and they don't do stupid shit and undermine our world just based on their need for pussy.

Speaker 4:          01:40:56       Dude, by the way, you don't need robot concubines you send out into the world. Hey Joe, it could be a form of the military like a suck his cock and especially with the troops satisfy the geniuses sexually like some branch. What if that was our fucking military like troops train, just a suck off geniuses and make them fucking happy. What if that was like how we like that's how we went to wars. We just sent troops of fucking blow job masters into the homes of geniuses and a complex just sucking them off of their habit.

Speaker 5:          01:41:26       Yeah. That's where they would take, they should take like all like super geniuses. Just bringing some sub place. Fuck getting pussy. Fuck having this ruin your life. We're just going to bring you constant Betches we're gonna pay you well, we just want you to be really creative time machines. It's crazy. And you want a family and you want to start to have children. We can see. We can arrange that as well. Yeah. The mastery simulators they do, but then they want all the money. They want to take it. They want to take all the money, like a bad record deal. Yeah. And anybody who's, you know, when you're creating things for companies,

Speaker 4:          01:41:53       well the here's, but here's the thing man. One thing you never hear when a kid's like, I want to be an inventor is another giving. Like you're going to get a lot of pussy. You know what I mean? If that, if that happened, we would be, we'd probably be floating right now. We'd be floating on a magnetic field, sending like our fucking thought patterns out into the world instead of talking into microphones. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:42:16       There was this guy that I remember who was like this famous hacker who had like a cartoon that he did online. I don't remember what his name was, but it was a big portly guy and he's like from Germany or some shit like that. And he Kimber, that's what his name was. I think pretty superiors Kimber and uh, he had co co cartoons of themself. Like we would go out and kill like evil dictators and uh, he would take pictures of himself. That dude made fuckloads of money. He was like a hacker and then he went from being a hacker to being an internet security expert that would help corporations. And um, he's like always driving around this crazy ya. Oh, he's got this crazy hooked up Mercedes. Here we are in my private jet. Here we are in Japan. Here we are. You know what Louis just landed in Brazil. I mean that dude was like on an international style baller and he uh, he just would put these pictures and videos of him just balling all over the world.

Speaker 4:          01:43:13       Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure that fucking like a lot of those guys are definitely getting like some crazy experiences. You know, they just probably have like refined desires, you know, they have different ideas of what they want, you know, I'm sure that, you know, is what they fucking do. Wazniak yes. Wazniak married. I don't know. I think so. He's a super g. We don't know what he does. You'll know and knows what he does. I'm pretty sure that guy could walk through walls, man. He's like really fascinating and smart and kind of like a, um, he was only involved with apple for a while, right? And then he left. Yeah. But now he's like, he's this fucking crazy son of a bitch man. He's like loon. Yeah. He's like a real like anti authority kind of person who likes to break rules and he's got fucking like a wallet full of like professional fake.

Speaker 4:          01:44:00       I see. He's with like really holographically printed. He was, it's like, it's on youtube. There's a video of him showing his fucking awesome fake ids that he oh yeah. He loves to like use technology to be a aunt to, you know, to break little rules and laws and stuff. It's kind of cool. It's really cool. In fact, you know, but you don't want a lot of those guys, right. You don't want to fuck and you need to see one or two of those guys have some fun, but you don't want 50,000 of those guys. What happens if we got 50,000 Steve Jobs? You know, cause it's like right now the thing that is driving so many of us, not me, I'm driven by my love of humanity and I want the world to be a better place. But I've heard that many men are driven by the desire to fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:44:43       And a lot of, I, I know this is probably shocking to you getting this. I've read, I read it, I read it on the back of a cereal box, but I'm not, could you imagine caution girls, men are driven by a secret desire to fuck. Why do they wear those crazy ties to let you know? Yeah man, but we no shenanigans here. Why? I am a gentleman with a tie on, but a lot of fucking professions. It's very strange. Some professions or fuck professions. Some professions are not fucking a fireman, a fire docstars or fuck profession. That's 100% rock stars a fuck. Perfect. Jagger, David Lee Roth. What do you think? Are you thinking of just getting mad pussy all over the planet? Yeah. I mean they've gotten so much pussy that they've like withered into jerky strips when you see him now. Well, they're also, you know the long in the tooth, man, it's just life.

Speaker 4:          01:45:38       Oh, I'm in the tooth, but no, no, no. It's not. No, that's not a normal senior citizen. These people are like, somebody made a stick figure out a beef jerky. They're fucking goddamn crazy looking from all the fucking, and they're still fucking, they're like, they're, they're still fucking to this day, if I, Agora is like runs in their veins, the spice there fucking all the time, dude. Still that's a different old man. What do you think like Mick Jagger on a regular week, how much young pussy does it yet? I think he's got her fucking rotation of probably 25 young, 25 coming book coming in and out and he's coming. Women with women would be like, why would you want that? Let's pretend that you, we have a girl on the podcast with us that is like probably, maybe secretly attracted to you, but really upset that you're talking about this openly.

Speaker 4:          01:46:27       Why would you want that? Why would you want, what would you want 20 different girls? Why would you want that? You're attracted to me. Why would you want that? Well, look, um, I guess I don't because I want to fuck you. I don't want that stuff. It's ridiculous. I don't know, man. I don't know why, why we want that. Why, why girls might not understand that that's something guys want. But this is, here's the thing though, man. Um, uh, this is why I love this book. Sex at dawn, who, who are we just saying would have a 20 girls? I believe it was Mick Jagger. Mick Jagger. I'm sorry. Oh, all right, good. Okay. So the idea is like, is this is one of the premises of this book is it's not a fucking genetic quality of being a woman that you don't want to fuck all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:47:10       That it's more of a culturally conditioned a thing that's happened from a, your upbringing. Cause we're in a very sexually repressed society and ladies liked to fuck. Now this app, what does that have to do with the sexually suppress part? But they want to fuck more because we're sexually suppressed. They want to fuck more than they let on they bit cause it's like, you know, I mean this is what they let on. Yeah. Cause when you're, when you're a guy, what's the number one first thing you got to fucking do once you grow pubic hair, what's the number one first thing you got to get fucking laid, man. You don't want to be a virgin. Oh I'm 23 and I'm a virgin still. It's like a mark of shame. Meanwhile I'm like a hot girl is like, yeah, you know I'm still a virgin. I'm saving myself from man. Oh. So they must, you know that if she's 23 and she's a virgin, she's probably a really good at head. Oh yeah, no shit. She's figured out a way to get guys on with her mouth. Yes. That's for sure. Or maybe her asshole.

Speaker 9:          01:48:05       Oh this guy over the puppet though. I love you won't bring up up in. No fucking say on

Speaker 4:          01:48:16       Yah. High point of my fucking commy comedy career is getting a Goddamn massive from people saying, Andrew Dice Clay says that he likes part of my fucking hat. Dude, that's intense from it's hot as fuck in here. Isn't it? Fucking hot? Hey, I'm going to turn the air conditioning on, so why don't you just talk to the people about your life. Be by myself and rambled. One second. One second. Okay. Don't be scared. Well, friends, you're going to do a mini, um, oh, mini rant here. You're going to just leave me here. This is some kind of fucking prank, okay? There's no need for you to feel alone in the world. My friends open your heart up to the eternal spirit of life and you will find that you will draw into your orbit many beautiful things, including delightful, wet, pussies that comes happy moments, happier moments. You just have to stop hating. Let go of the pain. Let go of your anger. Open your third eye and allow yourself to embrace the idea that God is love.

Speaker 10:         01:49:23       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:49:23       Visit Duncan trussell.com www.duncantrussell.com and join my Minecraft server. We have a Minecraft server. I play Minecraft. It's one of the loneliest, creepiest what the fuck are you doing? You transplant? No, I'm telling, telling the Internet to go to my Minecraft server and that's what I'm spending my time doing.

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       Are you really, have you ever played Minecraft? No, I just rambled for a long time. Sorry about that. You guys. I was disjointed. Rambling Dunkin. We do what we've been doing for two hours. But it's genuine. Your own, when you're alone in their room, everything changes. Yeah. One thing that you and I have both been backing around, um, or a a battering brother around is this idea of the simulation theory idea. We keep bringing it up, man. It's a point where it's like, I wonder if, you know, if you really want to get hardcore crazy with the idea of manifesting reality with your ideas. You know, I wonder, I wonder if you could manifest at the whole thing really is some sort of a simulation. I wonder if you could manifest that. I wonder if it literally can morph that far around dude. Um, it sounds so hippy and stupid. It sounds so stoner stupid. It sounds so that dude or just smoked a joint man is the first time at a bad day, man. It doesn't, it doesn't stop it from, from being possible.

Speaker 4:          01:50:52       Well man, I mean when you like, there's a lot of fucking crazy shit when you start playing around with simulation theory and I'm so glad you brought it up because we get this archetype and many of the world are religions that involves the uh, man, God, that God being eaten by man, the God that gets sacrificed for the sake of humans, the God that merges in with human beings. The fucking shit movie. Promethium tried to address this and aren't really crap way, but like the, um, the notion of the, the creators or whatever. But what's really fascinating about the idea of being in a simulation, like if we are in a simulation now, is that we are a mortal and the sense that we are computer code that's being run through of, uh, um, some form of operating system. And because we're just computer code, we can be as that.

Speaker 4:          01:51:39       There's actually this guy from the tech singularity institute. I can't remember his name. No, I think he's from Oxford. It's on youtube and he's talking about this idea of vivisected the human brain scanning the neurosystem, plopping that shit into a computer after you scan the synapses and the exact structure as close as you can, as accurately as you can. You run, you run this through a simulator and now you haven't been with consciousness living inside a computer. Not only do you have a being with consciousness living inside of a computer, but he was said was so awesome as you could. It could then theoretically be rewound. Time could be, it could be sped up, it could be pulsed. You know what I mean? So you could like control the reality of this being in some really bizarre ways. And so what, what, what, where it gets really fascinating is that the person who this neurological scan was based, the first the living being the meat body whose brain was put on some kind of futuristic combination, Deli slicer slash neurology scanner.

Speaker 4:          01:52:41       That fucking being died had to so that the being inside the simulator could live. And so then you get into this. Those are the only way to make this thing as a slice it up. All type of crazy world. I'll tell you this, the only way to make a computer right now is by fucking putting the pieces of the computer together. It's not through slicing it up. The point is, if this is a simulation, the implication is that it was created by a living being, you know, and that living being theoretically is mortal, you know, and so that mortal being has died. That mortal being may have died eons ago depending on who knows. Cause time is, uh, is based on the, uh, simulation know, nutty idea. The literally the universe began right as you were born. There was nothing before that. Yeah. There was nothing existed before that.

Speaker 4:          01:53:36       It was born. Yeah. Right when you were born and everything that you, you think of is complete utter horse shit. Everything you think I was just a simulation of the universe being born when you were born. It's just because that's when they plugged you in. That's the moment they plugged you into the simulation. Well, fucking, yeah, it's, it's a mine. Melter and here's where it gets even more mind fucking melty because everybody's talking about this idea of the singularity. The moment that our computers wake up, our machines wake up and become aware that they exist as a thing. But where it gets really trippy as the idea that we're inside the simulation and we're the machine waking up. We literally are the thing waking up to an awareness of itself and gaining consciousness of itself in a true way. That's what humans are. They the, the, the fucking, I almost want to rewrite the, uh, the garden, the garden of Eden story, replacing the word God with programmer because it gets so fucking cool and like the programmer made man in his own image.

Speaker 4:          01:54:40       You know, what's, what's really getting really crazy craziest when you get to these scientists who are saying that they found computer code concealed in superstring equations, not just fucking ones and zeroes, but what this guy calls dual error correction code, which is some form of weird fucking shit that's already in our web browsers. And based on the technology or the invention of a programmer in the 1940s, I mean, this is some lost shit here. This is some La Shit, but it's been dismissed, man. I mean, I've been raving about it on my podcast and some people like said that it's a real fringy theory and you know, who knows. But it started, I thought it was a thought. It was um, proven the, it's coming from a respected, a theoretical physicist at the University of Maryland. I can't remember his name, but it's definitely not like a Kook. It's coming from a respected scientist who has found this shit and he's a equations. They're using the represents supersymmetry and string theory, string theory, these weird symbols. These used to try to represent it. But yeah, man, it's still like, it's a pretty eerie thing, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:55:49       Tried to explain it to 'em Neil degrasse Tyson in a video. Yeah. And uh, it's, it's thoughts, the whole premise of it is very hard to wrap your head around. But this guy, his name was doctor s James Gates Jr. Yeah. And he's a theoretical physicist and with a crazy haircut. Yeah. Yeah. The John s toll professor of physics at the University of Maryland and the director of the Center for string and particle theory is reporting that certain string theory, super symmetrical equations, which described the fundamental nature of the universe and reality contain embedded computer codes. These codes are digital data in the form of ones and Zeros. Not only that, these codes are the same as what makes web browsers work and our error correction codes, Gates says we have no idea what these things are doing here.

Speaker 4:          01:56:47       Wow. So, so that's where it gets crazy. Our first contact with a fucking alien is going to be with the, uh, you know, the programmer. But it gets, it gets where it gets really weird. Joe, here's where it gets really fucking weird is the idea that the city that we're running in a simulation inside a simulation and the same way that we're trying to simulate reality through video games, Sim city, various fucking weather pattern, supercomputers and all the various ways we try to articulate reality through machines. This has already been done in a previous machine that's articulating itself like some kind of mirror flack refracting off itself, infinitely going into itself, always inventing itself again and again and again. And again.

Speaker 5:          01:57:31       If that is the case, what a trip it is. The idea of gang venting video games while inside a simulation.

Speaker 4:          01:57:37       Yeah, but see this is where it gets cool because maybe the simulation itself as a novelty Generac generator, maybe the simulation, what it's here for is to generate, you know, a novelty which is like, look man, let's see what happens if we put an entire planet full of people who quantum, you know, Nano bots have done neurological scans of their brain to come do like kind of like neurological thumbprints, which we then animate within the machine. Let's see what they do. I mean, what we did was we invented some crazy shit. Let's see if they invent some new shit inside the simulator. And all of a sudden the simulators inventing new technologies that are going up through the God damn, uh, the different via levels of the machine until finally it pops out and the programmers desk and he's like, oh, fucking awesome. Look at this. One of these beings invented time travel. Let's make a time machine and machine invented time travel. Who knows? But it's like a really great computer. Like right now we put into like, what's it called? A Wolfram alpha. You can throw in some pretty awesome equations and I'll spit out like you can do a lot of crazy shit, but how great would it be if you had just a machine where you just seed it

Speaker 6:          01:58:42       with living beings and it starts regurgitating inventions that these beings are creating? How fucking awesome would that be? You know, you know what I've found the other day, man, it's laying around here somewhere. It's a, a camera on apple camera from a long fucking time ago, man. And it looks like such a piece of shit now. It's so funny. This was like one of the first digital cameras. It's like a dinosaur and it's only for my tiny amount of years ago. What is 15 years in the greater spectrum of the university or just even of human history. It ain't shit. 15 years ain't shit. But this 15 year old camera was fucking useless. Just useless. Stupid looking cameras. They always, that's another component of technological advancement is each um, each earlier phase always seems stupid stupid. But when it comes out it seems awesome. Awesome. Well try driving like an old car.

Speaker 6:          01:59:39       You know, old cars look great, but if you try driving like a a 19, 69 Chevelle, the really hard to handle. There's a lot of slack in the steering. They're this crazy power steering where it's really numb. It feels real strange that they slide all over the place. He hit the brakes, they lock up and go sideways. I mean, they're really dangerous death traps. Yeah. And then go from that to what you drive that many. The thing is like a little go karts go karts. Bay Ship had there you, it ain't no go card. That's my, I mean it's the way it's low to the ground like that. That thing is, it's light. And when you get a light car that has like a really good drive train in a good transmission and tight steering, it's like, you know, no that wasn't even on possible. What your mini, you know, people would consider, you know, a sporty like sort of economy car.

Speaker 6:          02:00:28       Yeah. That was a race car just a few decades ago. Dude, what about this? If I take my fucking phone, I guess you know that you've been dealing with this for years, but like I've been driving an 89 Volvo that could barely get me to the fucking grocery store for a very long time, but to, so for me being on the phone and then I get into the mini Cooper and it goes in the system. It's amazing. That's crazy. It just does it, it knows the phone just shifts into the speakers of the car. That's insane, man. It's incredible if you really stop and think about it, and if you think about the fact that we're driving around like that, you know, just talking in the air and it's transmitted to someone else who's driving around doing the same thing. How about the fucking what the quantum teleportation shit they're doing where they're blasting photons across lakes.

Speaker 6:          02:01:13       So what the fuck is that? And they're saying like the articles that I've read and I didn't research them deeply, but the articles I read it, they're saying, well this isn't teleportation, but it's a nice step in that direction. Like what did you just say? You actually made a step in the direction of teleportation. Like think of the effect that has on society. Teleport fucking station man. Where like instead of having to go through a security line at a god Damn airport, you just Zap Zap from your home teleporter to fucking Asia in a millisecond. Where do you want to eat tonight? France or China? I don't know. You decide. You always make me fucking decide. What about that nice little kaboshed place in Egypt? Let's go there. Now you're just deciding anywhere on the planet that you want to go. Good. More like people showing up and then kicking you in the balls. What's a Kebab? I don't know. What is it? Kaboshed I just made it up. So it's that thing. It's a stone food. It's something, it's a mythical stone stone or food. The exist in mine. Simulator. A Cup. Bosh never heard of it, dude. I think I wanted to say like something between a Kabbalah and a squash or something. I don't know.

Speaker 6:          02:02:20       It's a combination of the tree of life. Mixed them with like buttered squash, the Kabbalah. The Kabbalah was like the thing that like Roseanne was into for a while and Madonna I believe was into it for a while too, right? Well, yeah man. And before them and it's been around much longer than that. It's like, you know, a Taro cards are based on it. It's a, it's a crazy son of a bitch, man. It's just, uh, it's trying to like map energy flows from nothingness into somethingness and it's a, a very strange esoteric thing, which I don't understand. I keep wanting to study it more when I, when I got strep throat and was fucking blasted on Cody and for five days I spent a good two days just fucking reading the Kabbalah and I had fucking and Tarot cards and I was putting them on the floor to try to understand the way they connect to the Kabbalah.

Speaker 6:          02:03:07       And, and I, I don't remember anything that I got out of that, but it was like a little bit of it because it's very complicated. I keep like peep. Some people have emailed me and said they understand it and um, I think I might get Rosanna my podcast and then I could ask her directly do that would be incredible. Roseanne Barr's a real fucking, she was a real legend man. She was a firebrand. Yeah. I mean, isn't she trying to run for president as was just too, yeah, she's running for fucking president, man. She's going forward. It's a good way to get info out there, you know? Wow. It gets, you know, it gets some exposure and she does not give a fuck. I know what it's also a fun thing, I'm sure. No, but you can't really think she's going to be president. She doesn't think she's going to be president, but she's got like shit that she's trying to get out into the world.

Speaker 6:          02:03:52       I mean if you follow her fucking Twitter stream, man, she blasts and crazy shit out there and Ron Paul couldn't fucking make it through. That was, that was a disappointing one, man. That was almost like, wow, let's see. Maybe this is real. This is real. But there's like so much evidence with them trying to suppress his victories. If you want to go bliss. States kept that shit on the routes. God, we always fall for the trick. I fought for every fucking year, man. I thought every election I leave while I'm certainly wanting to believe with Obama, I felt like he was the closest guy to us. You know who's like in his forties young guy, black guy is single mom, you know the whole deal. Like you figured this is a guy they would, he's going to set us, right, dude, I was on fucking sunset boulevard and silver lake drunk howling at cars with a group of hipsters when Obama got elected.

Speaker 6:          02:04:42       I was so fucking happy. I voted. I voted for him. I fucking man. I was like, this is it. This is it. And you know, he has done some pretty not look before I get as fucking assailed by a million tweets about the fucking drone attacks guys. I unders. I fucking understand. I do know that the, the, there's some fucking, his DEA is busted more God damn dispensary than George W. Bush fucking DEA. You know, like there's some fucked up shit going on, but he, you know, there are some other things that he's, you know, he's big thing was the social thing to me. It was like, why don't we have accepted a guy who's half black from a single mom, you know, who admits he smoked marijuana, you know, did he say he did a little cocoa? But this is the problem. He fucking jokes about smoking dope and it's God Damn d A's tossing farmers in prison.

Speaker 6:          02:05:34       Yeah. And not only that, you know, we're selling this hemp force protein powder. We can't even grow this hemp in America. We have to get it from Canada because although in, and thank you for informing me and all this folks, people tweeted me that it was legal in Vermont. So, uh, we looked into it and it is, but the, the federal government is not letting people do it. They're still saying it's illegal federally and this is just growing the plant hemp, which isn't psychoactive at all because it's related to marijuana. They've decided that there's no way people should be able to grow it. Just hilarious. So you can, you can have it, but you've got to buy it from Canada. So we have this wacky deal when you have to import that shit, even though it's, it's not even psychoactive, they're just telling you that a useful plant is illegal to, it's really weird.

Speaker 6:          02:06:21       I mean it's, it's one of the weirdest aspects of the drug war and you know, the, the, the, the war for marijuana legalization is the, the, the actual like hemp, hemp fiber, they actually hemp as a, uh, as a resource, you know? Oh yeah. It was a commodity. Hemp as a commodity is very, very valuable. It's very valuable, yet illegal to grow and harvest in this country. I was just stunned by the colonies and people don't have any idea that it's, that's what rope used to be made up. That's what canvas is made out of when you paint. All is like ancient paintings. Like, like the Mona Lisa, those are made on cannabis. It's canvas. It's the, it's the, it's comes from the word cannabis because it's a stronger fiber. Cotton is weakest Shit and compared to him like we get used to cotton, we're just, we just assumed that that's just what it is. It is what it is. But the cotton is nothing compared to him. Hemp papers, better hand papers, like really hard to ramp. It's like fucking super strong. It's weird. It's kind of like an alien plant man. The stock is really light but it gets real dense and hard. Dude, don't get me going on the fucking on that plant man. Cause I guess it's insane when you get around a nice flourishing marijuana.

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       You know like when you get around a fucking monkey and it's like dog plus marijuana plants. Maybe I'm just projecting but they seem like plants plus like they seem like is a little bit more going on in the sons of bitches. They've got a weird fucking energy field around him. It's just different dispensers grow room once and you, you walk into their backroom, they had a grow room and the grow room was like Tingley and there's all these plants that are like super healthy and super moist. They're getting spray. They have like a little spray thing. It's timed soprano. I'm certain times during the day and they have, they live under these lamps and you know the lamps are on for a certain amount of time off for a certain amount of time and you watched it and it's like these are like intelligent creatures. They feel like they're, they're, they're feeling, they're greeting you with their energy and strange around one of the dentists even creepier that you chop them up.

Speaker 4:          02:08:29       Like, what the fuck? Bad. You don't even let them grow. He grows and grows a certain point. And then I'm like, all right, time to dive edge. Yeah, chop them and then you light them on fire, dude. And that's the relationship. It's the fucking fire sacrifice, man. It's like this isn't, you know, this is like an every single religion there is a reference to burning incense. There's Bush burning the burning Bush. It's an everything dude. And it's like the fact that the component has been removed from the equation, the variable, it's, they're trying to take the variable out of the fucking equation. It's like when I, sometimes when you go to certain churches, it's like a bunch of people. How many churches are you going to? Oh Dude, you gotta go to fucking churches from time to time. He kidding. Fuck yeah, man, there's so psychedelic and cool and interesting phenomena.

Speaker 4:          02:09:18       It's like I don't, I mean, I will, I'll, I'll go to a church over a zoo. Really? I'll go to a church over a laser light show. So how often are you going to churches? I've been, I went on for a little tear of going to a gnostic Christian Church because of this book that I read. Yeah, I would, yeah. You eat some edible marijuana and go to the GNOSTIC Christian Church to watch the GNOSTIC mass, which is this beautiful ancient ceremony, which is like basically a, an, it's an [inaudible]. It is. It's an a cult ritual. It's like you're doing something called the transubstantiation, which is transforming matter into like the flesh of infinity. But the gnostics don't look, take things literally. It's a different fucking thing all together and it's quite beautiful. I'm not a gnostic Christian, but man, chomp on some fucking marijuana. Go to a GNOSTIC Christian Church respectfully.

Speaker 4:          02:10:10       Don't go there like some asshole. Go there respectfully and fucking report back. You'll find that the experience is rather moving and beautiful and it's um, uh, when you can see how that component and a religion is very important. The psychedelic. See we do psychedelics now, right? Generally we do. Psychedelics would, we don't have ceremony. We have a kind of rudimentary ceremony, the passing of the joint, certain rules based around the, the, the consumption of the substance. But there's no real like ceremony after that. I think some people do it, but it's mostly you get high and you watch them, you know, you're hanging out with your friends. Maybe you work out, go jogging, draw. Right. There's like rudimentary, low levels, their monies. But no, like chanting candles, incense.

Speaker 5:          02:10:55       What's the benefit of the, of the, uh, ceremony?

Speaker 4:          02:10:59       Well, one, one thing that, the first thing to remove from, uh, when it comes to like spiritual staff is the term is benefit. You know what I mean? Because it's like, it's, it's a weird thing that plays against a lot of the way we understand shit is it's like, no, there isn't. It's not like you're not going for it for like so much a benefit though. It is entertaining and you are getting some instant kind of benefit from like, just like being in a beautiful space, listening. People chant when you're super baked. There's some immediate benefit that comes from that. But the, um, I think there's a lot of, I mean, the, the, the, the, it's a deep, it's, for me, the experience was like, this is a very old thing that I don't understand that well, and the energy in here is fucking cool.

Speaker 4:          02:11:48       That was it. The first, that was the first thing that came out of it. And then, um, I, the priests made a joke about marijuana actually. It was, it was like, really? Yeah, when he was talking, I can't remember, but I remember being like, Whoa, fucking crazy man, because I just been reading in this book, um, magic marijuana in religion that like cannabis was ritualistically consumed and Nasik ceremonies. And so it was like kind of weird and interesting. Anyway, man, it's, it's a, it's a beautiful fucking thing. But when you see rituals that don't have psychoactive components in them, sometimes it feels like you're watching people warming their hands on dry tender that hasn't been set alight and pretending that there's fire coming up out of it, you know, it's like you, you room to remove the psychedelic from ritual. When we see in like so many indigenous cultures, the, it's a component of their spirituality and their religion. It's kind of interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:12:48       Yeah. It was a, a very important aspect of the growth, you know, a very important aspect of the, you know, the, the ceremony itself, the transcending to the next stage, the going through the experience, the trip, you know, to having the vision quest, you know, the, the, the payoti ritual, whether it was the Iowasca ritual, whether it was mushrooms and, and you know, in South America and Mexico, whatever, whatever it was, it was all about a transformative experience. It was all about, you know, getting closer to Gaia, getting closer to the energy of the, the, the true energy, which we all get off, man. It's, society is very complicated. You know, there are social interactions are so overbearing, the, that

Speaker 6:          02:13:31       there's 300 million of us jammed onto this spot interacting with each other all the time. And it's, it's, it's hard to, it's hard to stay steady. It's hard to stay on track, not freak out, but then this comedy and freaking out tills problem too. The more you freak out and get pissed and things, the funnier it is.

Speaker 4:          02:13:48       Yeah. And you got to let yourself freak too. I mean that's another thing is like people, this fucking thing where people are all about being happy all the time. People have confused, um, you know, happiness is the end goal. Like having this emotional state of just, I'm happy today. Like that's not it. Ideas being you're fully yourself and the entire spectrum of emotional experience, you know what I mean? And it's like to in part of the emotional experience of existing is to having meltdowns from time to time. Like it's good to have a nice meltdown from time to time. It's good to like freak from, don't beat yourself up for fucking losing your shit, right? It's going to happen. Why wouldn't you lose your shit? You're in a goddamn simulator with fucking dual error correcting code at the fundamental layer of the universe. And the thing is more than likely complete.

Speaker 4:          02:14:34       We're too stupid to really understand that more than likely a telescoping simulation where each incremental telescoping moving out becomes more and more in tropic and out of focus. And we're somewhere in this like middle, mid range of this telescoping simulator that keeps getting washed out more and more and more. This is the principle in physics of the universe expanding and running out of energy or the ID and Hinduism of Kali. You get the final age of human beings are the Mayan calendar and all the various per uh, uh, um, eschatological prophecies talking about the end of the world. The fucking simulators going to run out of juice. Someone's getting get called the dinner and have to stop playing the fucking game or go out or

Speaker 6:          02:15:18       Aloma country. Hello God, I love of guns and anybody wants to change that. You've got to come through me. I got to come through me. I love my simulator. I love the programmer and anybody who wants to fuck with the operating system is going to have to go through my firewall. I love the engineer. I took the blue pill. Yeah, right. Well then you know, those guys are nuts. They don't one of those fucking guys get a section. Yeah. Well, you know, the whole, uh, controversy behind the script, there was a woman, a claim that she had written that and given it to them like years before, and they took the idea and made it a movie. But I think she lost, I think she lost in court. It's gotta be hard to try to get money out of the matrix, even if it's true. It's fucking so much money behind that does that machine. But yeah, she sued she, I don't know if she's crazy. I shouldn't even be bringing it up because you never really know. Like sometimes, sometimes people steal ideas, but sometimes people are kind of crazy. And also the idea of the matrix, it sounds like an age old idea. It's like, yeah, but I think the similarities were very extreme. Oh really? Yeah. I'm talking out my ass. Let, let me pull it up real quick. Hey trick. So awesome. What a great movie, man. There's so much

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       information and coded and that son of a bitch SQLs are terrible. I don't remember the sequels, you know? No Man, I really don't. I remember that

Speaker 5:          02:16:40       first. Honestly, they gave them the reins to somebody else. Snopes. There's a Snopes, which means it's a problem, right? Isn't it usually what is, nope. Yeah. When Snopes, it's like they're clearing up a myth isn't an almost all Snopes climbing up myths. Yeah. This is a, it says the claim is that she want a large judgment in a copyright infringement suit over the other ship that film the Matrix. That is false apparently. And she started in okay in October 4th, 2004 ended a six year dispute involving Sophia Stewart. And so for six fucking years of dragged on copyright infringement, racketeering received and acknowledged by the center, um, central district, California, blah, blah, blah, blah, Blah Stewart who has resided in Salt Lake City for the past five years. We'll recover damages from the films. Wait a minute. She will cover damages to Matrix one, two and three as well as the terminator and SQL as Holy Shit. She will soon receive one of the biggest payoffs in the history of Hollywood as well as gross receipts of both films and they're sequels to total of two point $5 billion. Steward for what? I thought it just said, it wasn't route. Yeah, I got confused. I thought they were explaining it. Oh, this is examples. This is examples of the various lies. Oh, I see. Okay. Two point $5 billion. Apparently she generated controversy by claiming in a lawsuit brought against directors, Andy and Larry, which one became a chick.

Speaker 4:          02:18:07       Okay. When can I ask you something? Holla. When you deposit a huge amount of money into a bank and deal your bank account, how long does it take to go through? Like if you deposited like $1 million in your bank?

Speaker 5:          02:18:20       I don't know. Listen to this. Stewart's case was dismissed in June, 2005 when she failed to show up for a preliminary hearing of her case and a 53 page ruling judge Margaret Morrow, the Central District Court of California, dismissed the suit saying Stuart and her attorneys had not entered any evidence to bolster its key claims or demonstrated any striking similarity between her work and she didn't show up. That's crazy. Well, Amanda, what that is, you think they paid her? They pulled her son Cillizza bench.

Speaker 4:          02:18:48       I don't know. I'm maybe why there? Why not? They've got a shitload of money. Who knows? I don't know. Probably not. Wonder One. How close it was close. The case was, I mean, she's a who knows, man, you can do, you can take anyone to court. You know, like you can file suit against people, right. I mean, people when I worked at the comedy store have filed suit against Mitzi for sending negative telepathic vibes into their thoughts. For reals. Yeah. Quitting to go to court for that. Kooks look up the parking meter lady. There's someone suing the city for their new parking meters. You can Google search it. It's like all over the news right now. It freaked her out. So some people just like lawsuits, they just get really good at it.

Speaker 6:          02:19:28       It's like a hobby. Just fuck with the system. Trying to drag things through. Well, I mean of course some people make a lot of money, like some people will actually track down ladies nights and sue the fucking companies cause they can't get in. Yeah, yeah. That's hilarious. Yeah, that's like a way that's some people's bread and butter. This is that people will find places that aren't like equipped for handy if for uh, for people in wheelchairs and they'll fucking sewer man. And you know, in that way, I am very much a feminist and I think women should be allowed to have their own fucking gym and I don't think you should be allowed to protest that. I think if women want to work on a gym, would no drooling. Fucking ape dudes, any guy who tried to go to the gym is an asshole. If you want to go to a gym that's just completely filled with women who don't want to be around men, they know the deal.

Speaker 6:          02:20:18       That's what they agreed to. And you want to claim that your rights are being violated because this gym is closest to you, so you just, by proximity you should be allowed to use it. Like they shouldn't be. What? Ridiculousness. That you shouldn't be allowed to limit your business to only include one gender because the other gender is always trying to fuck that single gender. They'll always make an uncomfortable and feel weird when they're fucking stretching out. Yeah, that is fun. It's fucking gross. It's gross. It's gross than any asphalt would actually try to sue them for that, but that you would want to go but, but you know, but that's weird because like, you know, women's bathrooms are like sovereign nations for women and men. A man can't sue to be allowed to go into a women's bathroom or a woman can't sue to be in a man's man can sue if there's not a woman's bathroom.

Speaker 6:          02:21:02       If you go to a place and there's only a man's bathroom, you could too, right? You have to have both. Yeah, you have to have balls. So they would have to build a gym if they built a gym next to that, Jen, all men and one would be empty and one will be filled with women. Well, all men, Jim gets filled with gay guys. Oh yeah, I forgot about that Gold's gym. Dumb joke. I forgot about that. I, when I first was on news radio, I'd work out there and I had this whole bit about it doing a bench press and dudes would just like spot you wouldn't even ask. They would just literally just dangle their balls right above your head. They were like so cocky, like dudes were like hitting on dudes left and right in this jam. It was crazy because that's what they were there for.

Speaker 6:          02:21:43       I watched these guys just, just fucking grunting through a set. There were uh, doing, um, the guy was doing rose, you know, so he's like bent over and the other guy, his chest to back. Okay. Pressing down on him. And the way he's spotting him is, you know, the guy is holding onto the bar and he's holding onto the top of the bar, chest to back and it's like he's fucking a man. I mean, it's like, it's really physical. Like if I was doing that, I would, you know, if it was a check, if I was doing that to my wife, I'd get a tech. My Dick would get hard. If you were, we're helping our pull and push like that, he would start just put this fucking laid down. What's up? You know, you would immediately want to fuck. Well now mean it's a fucking motion.

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       And these guys were doing that in the gym. No, it's funny how like them

Speaker 4:          02:22:31       funny how the mythical, the mythical world of porn, like an egg is in the porn universe. The physics of porn or not the physics of the material world, the physics of porn. That shit happens, dude. You're at the gym. And some chicks like, Hey, can you spot me for a second? And you're like, sure, I'll by you. And then like, just, she's just starts sucking your Dick. You're like, wow, I can't pull that. Guess I owe you one zip. Yeah, yeah. That's the physics of porn. And then another dude will come over and just start jacking off and stick it into her while she's sucking your day. You don't care. You're like, hey, yeah, what's up? Let's run a train on this bitch porn physics. But in, but it's weird how like in like, you know, like places like what you're talking about, which, uh, I had this guy, uh, very fucking brilliant guy, Conner Habib who also happens to be a gay porn star on my podcast. And he was talking about fucking, um, you are your own actually a great essay on cruising. Uh, and, and, and uh, which will permanently shift your notion of rest areas permanently. But like, you know, he calls those types of gems that you're talking about. I think the term you used was cruisy is the word of it. So, yeah. So like those places, the physics in there are the same as inside porn. If you're a gay dude, you can go to a gym. And like, fuck, you're going to fuck.

Speaker 1:          02:23:53       Yeah, it's a completely different experience because just knowing Yang, it's all just everybody's just, or news. No Yin, I don't know which one is the hard style, but it's just, just fucking it up. That's it. They just, they're just looking to fuck

Speaker 4:          02:24:05       one thing I've never thought on my way to the gym as I'm probably going to get laid in here. Never thought that. I'm like, Oh, I think I'm going to be a fucking party. Get a blow job after my fucking a squats.

Speaker 1:          02:24:18       I told you when Bravo and I used to work out at this gym, we used to work out at um, 24 hour fitness and uh, when we would go there, there was a dude that we got friendly with. It was the manager guy, real friendly guy and he had just transferred over from Santa Monica and he was just so happy. He was so relaxed to be in like the suburbs. And I go, well, what's going on? He goes, I, I was brought in there to clean it up and he was brought in there because they were just fucking everywhere. They had just turned it into a gay gym. It was just not just a gay gym, but it was like, it was a gay pickup joint. It was a, it was a disco so they would a steam room, they'd fucking, the steam room. People would constantly be walking in on guys fucking in the steam room.

Speaker 1:          02:24:55       They'd find loads all over the benches. Shit, he'd have to come in and hose everything down. So they had to like literally like clean up the whole place and tell them they've got to stop fucking and people get mad at them. Like, what do I do? You think there was like one guy who was like straight and just annoyed all the time cause he was always sitting in ges and like, I just want to fucking work out dude. I'm sure there must've been some straight guys there. I though I was straight when I worked out at Gold's gym. I was straight guy back and when I started, before I went

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       queer I was straight and I was there and uh, so the guys I worked with were, were straight and they were there. It was a convenient Jim, it wasn't all gay, but it was at least 50%, maybe more gay. And they were really like, they owned it, they owned it. They owned being gay. They owned that place. They would wear like timberland boots with like fluffy, puffy socks and like shaved legs, very muscular legs with ready, ready, ready? Daisy Duke shorts. Yeah. And guys would work out like that with a tank top on. They were gay as fuck dude at the fucking Gold's gym. I used to work out at Gold's gym and Hollywood and cold. That's what I'm talking about. Gold's on coal. Ah, yeah dude. There was a guy in chaps, fucking black, a black leather chaps. Like he was like, just wandered off of a fucking I ranch filled with, but it's their spot man.

Speaker 2:          02:26:18       You know, like good for them that I've never understood anti gay feelings. They seem like they're having a fun time. I know, I know a lot of gay people and I, I, it seems like they're having a good time. They've got a lot of exposable disposable income, you know, I know this gay couple, they're always driving a new car. I feel like there, what a great thought. Yeah man. And yeah, no, I though these fucking homophobes he's so stupid box right now are really like really? But it's cool man because like what's happening, what's really cool and fascinating, it's like the bigots are the ones who were being driven into the closet. It used to be that like, it's like reversing like gay people are coming out of the closet and bigots are getting pushed into the closet that they came out of, which is great fucking, that's a good balance. That's what it should be like.

Speaker 1:          02:27:03       I've always said that, that, that's my take on everything. That as, as, as a, as a human being that I should be a humanist, you know, and I should, it shouldn't matter whether I'm with the straights or with the gays or the white to the block. We should all just be with the humans. And I resisted any ideas of being a masculinist or any ideas of being a feminist or any ideas of being a nationalist or any ideas of being a peacenik or more ma stop it. He's just like, this is ridiculous. You're a fucking human. We're all human and it should be real simple. We should get in each other's way as little as possible. Help each other out as much as possible. It's really that simple. It's very simple. It's really that simple. And anything else, it's crazy. And that's why, you know, if people got really upset about this whole tosh thing and people got upset at the backlash, but what I think, we can't ever pretend that intent is not important. What can ever pretend that there are buzzwords that you can never use or subjects which you can never cover or you know, or, or you're not allowed to because someone could have possibly had a bad experience. You're going to trigger an event that's not comedy, man. You, you, you can't have those sort of restrictions and have standup comedy. You're, it's not going to work that way.

Speaker 5:          02:28:22       You're going to miss out

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       on a lot of great comedy. Dude. You can't have those fucking restrictions on anything. You can't have it on literature. You can't have it on poetry. You can't have it on.

Speaker 5:          02:28:31       People want to restrict people. Why do these smart people want to come down on it so hard when they know what is really going on?

Speaker 3:          02:28:38       Well, it's a, I think there's a bunch of different answers that question. I think there's a variety of reasons people want to do it from the, uh, from like, I suppose like people who are like Crusaders and, and truly are true believers in what they're doing. Like really have gotten the fucking, um, the, the language virus to the, to, to the nth degree. And for really believe that they have to fucking shoot the abortion doctor in the fucking face, you know, really fucking believe till like all the way to the, the, you know, bottom level where it's just like people are trying to look fucking cool

Speaker 5:          02:29:13       or even worse. How about the guy who goes to the Sikh temple and doesn't even understand the Sikhs are very peaceful people and thinks that they're Muslims and somehow way, and he's got nine 11 tattoos on the spot and he kills a bunch of beer.

Speaker 3:          02:29:22       Yeah, yeah. How about that? No. See this, you want to Alex Jones it up. False flag operations. False flag. Well, look, man, I don't, I don't fucking know man. I, I, but I do think that the complexity of that, that I think that the, uh, that, that greedy, selfish lying people tend to use complexity to their advantage. And, uh, people who seem to be more on the fucking beam as the free masons say, um, have very simple ideas, very simple fucking ideas. Like what Ma, what Gandhi said, do, you know, very simple idea. Find someone who needs help and help them. It's simple and it right away. Some assholes, the Kale, but what does that mean? What does help mean? It's like, I'll tell you what help means. Somebody fucking might need you to loan them some money. Somebody might need you to bring them some soup. Somebody might need a ride to the fucking airport. It's not complicated, man. It's basic. And if everyone starts following the basic principles like that, then there's plenty of resources. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:30:24       The, the real problem is we've got this weird competitive game that's going on and it's a, it's set up not, not an efficient way where we generate just the amount that we need in order to be happy, but in some crazy way where you never think enough is enough and there'd be, the game becomes part of what motivates you. And instead of it just being about happiness, it's sometimes morphs into just being about the numbers, just being about the game, just being about accomplishments and you get nutty and you'd like, you could become a vendor Holyfield when you're living in 110 room mansion that cost $1 million a year to keep the electricity on. I mean that's, people can get like that. Yeah. There's a, I saw a fucking, uh, a piece of real estate online the other day that was a house for 40 fucking million dollars. I was looking at this house. I was like, that is the craziest fucking Shit I've ever seen in my life. There's, but somewhere there's a dude is like a medic

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       to take it to the next level and I'm here with this $10 million house. It's a piece of shit to me and many to move up fucking inkjet national. Want to be at the top monetary gangster type motherfucker. What's your serious shackles? Top of the tree. There's a great website. Check it out. Awesome blog. Rich kids of Instagram.

And they're saying they're going to have to like try to keep their kids from like posting this shit on Instagram cause cause it's a security threats.

Speaker 1:          02:32:09       So it is a website, instagram.com rich kids of instagram.com oh my God, this is awesome. It's amazing. They have a giant bottle of motorway and there were just scroll down more gallons of my way to do, get to the receipt. Just scroll down. There's $103,000 a seat. Wow. The girls chilling in a mansion. She's a little kid. Yeah, I can't, it's funny receipts but they've got some dope ass houses. Yes. It, yeah. Wow. Wow. Those guys live in a fucking castle. Yeah, and they live in castles. It must be really hard to be like, well, yeah, Harry has 107,000 I put the receipt online. What a Douche bag. But cokes are like 10 bucks Central Pa. Yeah. Cappuccinos. $12 Coca Cola is $20 zero $10 to Coco's, $10 each, but it's like crazy wines. Dom Perignon, $4,000 Oh, another dom, $5,000 Oh my God. It's crazy. Hundred seven grand for dinner.

Speaker 1:          02:33:13       What's the tip? Uh, it doesn't show. I know it says 170 ground. It's got to be maybe in central pay. You don't tip. Maybe it's one of those weird places. There's a lot of places where you don't tip. Right? You know? Or you do. You mean you can. I do, but they don't. They don't expect it. I'm sure the waiter gets taken care of at a restaurant that has $107,000 dinners maybe, but when you have 40,000 I said 4,000 I'm sorry, I meant 40,000 the dom Perignon is $40,000 so as the other one that's not 5,000 it's 50,000 that's why it's so hard. That's fucking incredible. You can buy a bottle of something for 50,000 bucks. Sure. We sure it's dollars. It's not. You can buy it. You can sell it. That's the hopeful aspect of it. There's dip shits out. They're going to pay 50 fucking thousand dollars for your goddamned carbonated grape juice. How dumb is that? That's awesome. It's another craziest thing of all time and someone would actually spend that much more. I mean, how good could it be because no way can be. It's probably not even as good as Koolaid Kool aid. It's fucking delicious. Especially if you're really thirsty. It's sweet. It's delicious. Dude,

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       if I'm paying $40,000 for something that should come out of the fucking some frozen vault of Sandoz laboratories in better piece of fucking, they'd better be the acid that Hoffman first generated and stored in a crystal vile somewhere deep under the Pentagon. That and even that maybe that would be worth $50,000 cause it'd be so life changing. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of silly man. It's kind of the, the the weird thing with wine. Wine is such a strange beverage. Those people that get together and work on the tastes of it and they have an educated pallets and some of them like they become, you know, like high level Somalia as they can like to tact like where the grapes are from, but just by taste and a glass of wine. Dude, it's weird. It's fucking weird. But it's, I mean definitely like when I went up to like I want to have to fucking solving wants to like get to drink like wine from the vineyards and it's awesome dude.

Speaker 2:          02:35:12       It's incredible. Then what over the variations in the taste and the like. The beauty of this set of the terrain. It's like a really beautiful thing man. It's like what's it like up there as a different, what's the climate like? I think when we were there it was hot as I recall man and summer was the summer. It was summer and we got this, you get like cars to drive around because you're going to get trashed going to the vineyard, slurp and all that wine and our fucking goddamn driver was like an Aa dude. It's like still our drivers, this sober guy driving us to the vineyards and you felt kind of guilty by the end of the day cause you're just like in the back of the God damn car with like crusty red wine all over Your Lips wanting to pee, come much wine. Did you drink over the course of a day?

Speaker 2:          02:35:54       Oh God, I didn't have to worry about a DUI and I was taking marijuana tincture at the same time. So what did you think? You tried to half a gallon maybe? Oh yeah, he's a half a gallon of wine. But I would imagine it's pretty, people must be fallen down, left and right upon their trashed. And by the end of the day you're like slurring your words, gesturing at fucking being great, great. Like things on the menu. Barely talk. I can't, I can never do that. Just you don't have to get, I can't, I can't get, well I can't get drunk at dinner ever because then I'm going to come home to the kids. I never really be drunk around my kids. And that's why it's good to have kids, man. God Damn it. The older I get, the more than human I feel cause I don't have a sweet little baby. Oh, I'd love a little fucking taught.

Speaker 2:          02:36:46       I'm sure you would. But you were first of all have to have a relationship with a person. What? Deep, deep relationship with a person and know each other very, very, very well. And you enjoy each other very much. And if you don't, you're fucked. And then it's a, becomes a nightmare. But you know, it keeps it from coming home drunk. That's for fucking sure. No, it doesn't. It doesn't keep a lot of people. Well, they're fools. A lot of people. It does not keep them going. I think it's you should not be or on your kid,

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       dude. Have you seen that picture of the baby sleeping under the bar stool? Here's the map picture. I don't want to hear him around it. Fucking dragging the kid to the bar. I don't even want to hear about it. Dude. There's so many people that just, they just fucking get a shit. Roll the dice and they're born into a family full of dummies. Dom. He is doing dumb things. Yeah man. It's a bit of a problem. I wondered if things are really changing Dunkin the way I feel like they're changing. I wonder if it's just my circle of people and a wonder if it's just a, the people that we come in contact with through the podcast and through Twitter that all the, the positive people, I wonder how much the world shares in the sort of the, the vibe that we, that we feel and that we're riding. And I always wonder if that is what, if putting that out there, if, if it's possible that we can get our shit together by using the Internet, by using podcasts, by using, you know, a different ways to communicate to each other that we can somehow another all be reached an all get our shit together in this generation more so than anybody's ever done before.

Speaker 3:          02:38:23       Well, you know, man, I mean, I think that there has to be a, um, you know, everyone has to keep using the technology. It's like, dude, like when I went to fucking Cincinnati might this guy, I met this awesome guy named Izzy you as you started his own podcast from listening to your podcast and listening to my podcast, he started his own podcast called tales from the hard side. And he came inside. Yeah, but he was, no man, he definitely is. It's like a fucking car, like a rip dude. Like he's definitely like had a awesome, a very fascinating life. But you know, the point is he started like, he listened to this and then he started doing, he started his own podcast and, and, and like, he's like, there's like a group of them who hang out together now from like listening to your podcast and from listening to my podcast and they started their own fucking podcasts, which is a kind of cool thing.

Speaker 3:          02:39:12       Fuck it. Because it's spreading. It's spreading it more, you know, it's like, it's like people, the bottom line is you can't get hierarchical with your geography because a lot of people are like, you know, I just live in Pennsylvania. There's no one here to have a good conversation with her. Wherever the fuck they say they live. It's like, I guarantee you're surrounded by people who want to talk about philosophical shit. And when I connect with someone on a level deeper than just what you had for lunch and what the, what will, you know what fucking clothes are cool or movies or whatever you say that. But unless you're in a city, that's probably not the case. Dude. I was just in, well, you know, yeah. That I, I depending on how old your especially, Oh man, all we all I know is that like,

Speaker 1:          02:39:53       I don't want to sound like too, like weirdly

Speaker 3:          02:39:55       having myself on the back, but it's you like when go to these fucking shows, dude, there's thousands of fucking people there. Yeah. And when you talk to them after the show, they're all really fucking cool and they didn't all just come from metropolitan areas. These people are coming from different towns and cities and then they have, but they have access to us. They don't, they might

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       not have access to people near them. That's what I'm saying, that also sharing those interests. It might not be anybody around them like that you might think there is, but unless they're in a, a really, uh, a large area where there's a lot of people to choose from, you might not be correct. It takes a lot of people, a lot of focus to break, to get the group of 2000 people that will come to see one of our shows. You got to go through hundreds of thousands of regular people to find those 2000 disenfranchise people that really want to say fuck. Yet Duncan Trussell to a little Hobo Bitch. You know the people that listen to this podcast, that people that, look, I've had people come up to me, they'd say, I hate the word cunt. And then I loved your podcast. The first time I heard you say con, it bugged me, but now I say it every day.

Speaker 1:          02:40:56       Now everything's a con to everyone's a con. She's a contest is a comp. My Cat's account, my sister's a cunt. And it just becomes a part of your vernacular. And that's I'm nothing I'm proud of. But that's the type of thing that can happen. And if it can happen with something bad or stupid or ridiculous like the word cunt, it can happen with any sort of idea. Any idea can get through because of a podcast like the idea of, you know, treating each other, treating each other really as if we are ourselves living in another life. The idea of recognizing that this really is a temporary situation, Shit, duration, temporary situation and you need to live it, you lead, need to live this bitch up. Okay, because you're not going to feel good unless you do. If you, you hang back and be that guy that you described earlier who was 30 well we jumped forward, you'll get my shit together and then 40 and still have a career.

Speaker 1:          02:41:41       But Hey man, I got a good job. I'm going to keep it for a little while. Maybe I'm going to learn how to be an apprentice. And then one day he's dead and he his ride and Keel over. Then it could be a guy like you, a guy who's kind of peaks and valleys and had dry spots and, and now is riding this new crazy wave where you sort of just figured out how to get on the board. Really fucking travel. Yeah. Yeah. That's a fucking cool thing, man. It's because it's right there and it just requires a kind of like a, um, you just have to fucking, it's really, so the thing is, it's so fucking simple. It's like, and it's not, it's not because to have access to people, it's not simple by any stretch of the imagination to have the right ideas.

Speaker 1:          02:42:20       Sure. But to, in order to get those ideas in front of people, that takes a heroic effort, man. I just like the thing that I'm hesitating to say, cause I don't want it to sound fucking coffee is like, I really do think that people can like organize. I do believe that in wherever you're at, man, there's gotta be something that, there's ways that you can fucking figure out other people who like have that we talk about here. Well, I think through Twitter, that's one way we can find out people that are interested in the same kind of shows that you're interested in and you find out that you're in your job. Hey, where's the cool motherfuckers up in Tallahassee? And you put that up on Twitter and you know, put Tallahassee is a attach Hashtag. Actually now people are doing it back and forth. That's it dude. And it's like that, that it's really fucking important because it's not just good enough to exist in fucking digital space with people you need. It's like something about getting into fucking meat space

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       with people and like exchanging ideas and like being around people. It like it. Uh, it kind of shines a light and the shadowy darkness that can come in to you if you've isolated yourself because you feel like you're a psychotic freak with insane ideas, you know, instead of realizing like, no man, a lot of people are thinking this shit right now. A lot of people are, a lot of people are willing to entertain all sorts of alternative ideas. You'd be amazed and they're around you. You know, like Margo, boy, Matt stags and down and where's the Mississippi or some shit, it's Tennessee. Something like that. Yeah. Which Nashville is in Tennessee, Tennessee as boss response as those Mississippi. But you know, he doesn't want to fucking be there anymore once I get out of there. The Internet, the Internet. Well I think stags is definitely like a on the precipice of some crazy shit happening cause he's like definitely becoming like a conduit for a lot of crazy ideas and he always hooks me up with like some with great guests and he's running the disinfect podcast too.

Speaker 2:          02:44:09       Yeah. So that's happening soon. I have to get with them, but yeah, it's um, we're, we're living in a strange time of transition. Um, I'm, I'm really curious to see, I think there's the whole Terence Mckenna 2012 thing is like I, I always, I always laughed. I always thought it would be really cool if it was true, but I'm way too stupid to really understand any of the science behind it, even if it's real or not. Or the arguments behind it. Like I saw the Watson disagreement or I think it was called, but Watson objection to Watson objection was a a mathematician who deciphered the TimeWave zero novelty theory and had his own objection to it. Fucking they both lost weight within the first paragraph. I was like, Oh fuck. You're saying there's also less complex mathematical reputations. The theory, and I've heard that just like you know, leap year wasn't accounted for since 2012 happened sometime ago.

Speaker 2:          02:45:02       So it's like, you know the, the the again, but this is like people getting caught up in the surface level shit and trying to like no, no, it's not going to happen on December 21st, 2012 and trying to like, but it's like no, look what's happening around you. I wonder if what they, they calculated when the calculated the Mayan calendars besides you know, the moons, the, the, the rather the eclipse of the moon and the eclipse of the sun. I wonder if they could calculate how long it would take for a culture to grow before it imploded. I wonder if there's like just a us, just a set number of like a culture can only last for, it's like you could run and then you fall down. Yeah. And they figured that out a long time ago. They're good for like these 10,000 year pulses or whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 2:          02:45:46       There's a guy, he's a easy, if you, I bet if you googled extinction theorist right now, that's what he's called. He's a, he's a, he's also the guy who's like into simulation theory too. Um, and he's, you know, he's tries to answer that question while we haven't encountered aliens species. And it is this notion that they implode in on themselves. I can't remember if it's on Youtube. I wish I can't remember his fucking name. He's brilliant. I put a clip of him on, of my podcasts when the same podcast that I was talking about. Uh, the guy from the University of Maryland because he was, he was, he was the one who was talking about the idea of vivisected. The human brain are slicing it into, um, fucking a thin, thin layers to scan the neurology. I've done got no extinction theorist. Shit man. I can't remember his fucking name. He's Barilla. There's evolutionary theory of course. But um, last dinosaur extinction theory. No. If you look up simulation theory and theory like studies, this shit, it's a really weird like ways that we can, ways that are a species could blink out. Oh so, so many ways. Anywhere. It's what the fuck is his name and his got him. Brilliant.

Speaker 1:          02:46:59       Have you seen those um, the impact of uh, meteors a meteor shower all over the world. They discovered 12,000 years ago you told me about this shit and the sedimentary layers. Yeah, they've done core samples and it's the same spot all over the globe. And it's the same sort of shit that exists when you have nuclear bombs going off and it makes like a glass so little, the world got pelted by fucking giant chunks of rock gets flowed sound of that ship bursting through breaking. The fucking sound barrier is, it goes rocketing down into the fucking earth. Boom, boom. That must've been fucked up man. I wonder if they had writing back then. Cause, I don't know if we know that they had writing 12,000 years ago. I know it, it all dependent upon whether or not that event, that 12,000 year old event was really the sort of mass extinction event that like Graham Hancock and a lot of people think might've happened to, uh, to human culture or cute humankind rather the human species because they, they, you know, there's a lot of speculation about like when is the oldest civilization?

Speaker 1:          02:48:04       And they pretty much settle on Mesopotamia and they set them on like Sumeria. But the, the, the Sumerian text details along lost civilization and older advanced civilization, like the kind of all, do they all talk about some dudes existed before really had it down. Yeah. And Samira was supposed to be like 6,000 this years ago. So imagine if that's what it was. So 6,000 year track from the time that they got pelted with, we can wrap our heads around how long that is. That's so long ago, but yet nothing, you know, in its greater spectrum of the universe, nothing. But in the, the, the idea of our lifetime, 6,000 years old, long fucking time ago, and they talked about an old civilization and old ancient civilization that existed that was wiped out the epic of Gilgamesh, which is essentially very similar to the Noah's Ark story about, about it.

Speaker 1:          02:48:57       Cataclysmic flood. Yeah. Floods. Yeah. They uh, they probably experienced some fucking nutty shit, man. It probably killed almost everybody. That's probably, that probably explains a of Shit. A lot of shit all over the world. Like gold, Beckley, Tat Bay, all these weird structures that they're finding from pre 12,000 years. There's a beck go Beckley templates 14,000 years ago. That means in Sumeria, the really old shit in Sumeria is like 6,000 plus years ago, 7,000 plus years ago. This is double that. So this is as old to Sumeria as we are to Sumeria as soon Maoris to us, that's the distance, the distance of people writing on clay tablets and scratches and these little scratches up and down and sideways. That was their whole language. And the, the idea that they wrote of something from 7,000 years previous maybe, and that's what go Beckley topic shows. It shows that there was a sophisticated civilization from 7,000 years prior to the, the people in Sumeria and the people in Mesopotamia 7,000 years earlier, they were making these 19 foot tall, gigantic stone columns.

Speaker 1:          02:50:11       They were carved with animals that were carved in a relief so that like they stuck out, which is a really sophisticated method of carving. You're not carving into the stone. You're actually making a relief. It sticks out so you chipped all the rest of the stone away to reveal this frog and to reveal this bird. And this is really sophisticated stuff. It's hard for people to wrap their heads around it. So when they start talking to him about like hunter and gatherers from, you know, wearing skins around their dick, that these are the ones that built this boy, I don't know. I don't know. This is a you, you might have more evidence of the fact that there might've been some really super advanced cultures. They got fucking pelted.

Speaker 1:          02:50:53       Just wiped out everybody. No talking anymore changed languages. No, no fucking written shit. No one knows how to write the fucking road. Like it was like the road nuclear ash falling down. Just fucking, just decimation. Well by studying genetics, I believe that they've found several extinction events in the human genome. Like they've isolated several events. I don't understand the science behind this. I really am talking like extremely deep out of my ass, but I believe they've shown that um, when studying the, the, the DNA from different human beings of all over the world, they've concluded that there've been several times where the human species has gotten very low as low as like a few thousand people and that, you know, we probably had a big number and then a much smaller number and it got as low as a few thousand people and then we had to recover. It's fucking amazing. It's amazing what they found out just by studying genes. You know, you will live in this kind of like that. One of the ideas of like the, the Freemasons are the rosy cruise shins are the secret societies. Is that that information from a very long time ago, it's been kept secret like yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:52:05       they sit but they kind of work signs do each other. They work symbols into the architecture of society. Right. Which is that fucking crazy guy. Damn. If you look at this, the, the street configurations of Washington DC, have you seen that shit where it's like a anatomically correct eyeball looking out over a pyramid? Just like the I and the dollar bill. I mean, come on dude.

Speaker 1:          02:52:31       How do you, how do you, how would you describe that? If I was going to Google that, a masonic symbols and d c I don't know. Washington DC, my sonic Washington DC road roads are guys, I don't know fucking, well it's you stoned to Google. I want to go with masonic symbols in DC. Yup. Here it is. Yeah. The um, they have it laid out. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 3:          02:52:56       I mean that's, that's like you got to really believe you have a Pentagram. Yeah. There's a Pentagram in there. There's a a fucking awesome.

Speaker 1:          02:53:03       So, so strange. Yeah, there's an eye, there's an optic nerve and I, there's a Pentagram. It's real weird when you look at like the money and you see the fucking all seeing eye in a pyramid on the cap of the pyramid is the all seeing eye. Like what are you saying?

Speaker 3:          02:53:19       I mean look man, printing it on money. Okay, but how about putting into the Goddamn geography of the fucking capitol of the country that you made? Trying to embody the ideals that you know, you knew and you encoded into the fucking very patterns. I mean, look man, there's a goddamn monolith. The Washington monument, an obelisk and Egyptian fucking obelisk rising up out of our nation's capitol. Yeah. Remember how the Egyptians helped with the revolutionary war? Cause I know they were there for us. Yeah. They came over and provided us with a,

Speaker 1:          02:53:57       uh, what's, what's even crazier is that Egypt at one point in time was thriving and then it's, this was nothing there. Like they, they, they showed up and the spanx was like covered up to its neck like during the age of Napoleon when they, when they first found that it was like a fucking, everything is abandoned. They'd already alluded all these different tombs. Who knows how much really incredible shit was melted down for gold baubles and shit when they didn't understand historical worth.

Speaker 3:          02:54:23       Well, I mean, dude, that I like one thing that like over time the time has proven again and again and again is that shit doesn't always work out great for the smart people with good ideas. You end up getting thrown into basements by dumb people who are like, what the fuck are you talking about? Galileo, they ended up in prison in you. Sometimes they crucify you, sometimes they embarrass you, sometimes they take away your property. So over time, really smart people were like, you know what, why don't we just fucking keep this shit to ourselves? Well, you know, that's it. The

Speaker 1:          02:55:01       theory behind the mushrooms and the church, that's the theory. Uh, I mean a lot of this was a young Urban's work and, um, another dude who died who turned out to be a child molester, but he did a lot of really good work, uh, with, um, with the, with mushrooms, with the historical, and he was writing a book with Jack Herer when he got arrested for being a child molester. This guy fucked up Jack Herer because of fucked up the research and were really like sort of invalidated and a lot of people's ideas like this work this guy had done. Um, but they have so many images and photos of ancient religious art that involves mushrooms. Symbolism. When you looked at it over and over and over again, you're like, oh my God. Like this is so obvious. Like first of all, the Halos, the Halos did not look like the, the Frisbee thing, the Hula Hoop.

Speaker 1:          02:55:47       They looked like a mushroom cap and they were circular behind the person's head. And the idea was to insinuate that that person that holds the person was under the influence of God under the influence of the mushroom. Yes. And that's totally believable. And that makes a lot of subtly believable. And the images of the doors, they're shaped like mushrooms, doorways are shaped like one is mushroom symbolism and so many different places. And there was so many images of people in bliss, naked in bliss covered in a mushroom. They would be in a transparent mushroom. These are like fucking ancient paintings.

Speaker 2:          02:56:17       I mean, yeah, it's definitely like we, we do know that there are encoded into the fucking a framework of our society and the Goddamn architecture of our society. Or it's a very odd symbols. Like if you look at the um, uh, the cathedrals, you will find gnostic sim symbols, chicken, God's Abraxis. You can see Abraxis in some cathedrals. What does a chicken, God, it's some gnostic fucking God you can Wikipedia praxis. It's, this happens to be the same name of the company doing this goddamn trap wire shit too. Yeah. Look up Abraxis gnostic Abraxas at chicken headache. How do you spell it? A. B. R a. N praxis access Abraxis gnostic Wikipedia.

Speaker 2:          02:57:00       For some reason, the creepiest God damn information gathering surveillance company that's ever climbed out of the shadows or been exposed to happen to name themselves after a gnostic God with a chicken head. What the fuck man? Yeah, go figure a chicken. God. Well this thing is freaky looking. Yeah, it's freaky looking and that's in cathedrals. They like, it's like a lot of the, the um, the, that, you know, a lot of these symbols, they what they think it feeds roles were apparently I read this and I can't remember the name. It's one of Graham Hancock's books that fucking stag sent me cause he's trying to drive me insane. But one of the, but, but, but um, but yeah, like in the, in this fucking book it talks about how the cathedrals were like a nexus where, um, a person's shoulders, a chicken man chose it as a, ma'am, I've seen the one with the chicken. It's definitely a chicken. Oh, that's weird. Because this one, uh, this image is a man. Look, Google Abraxis chicken. Okay. Fast gnostic chicken and fucking Nashville. It's a great

Speaker 1:          02:58:02       name for a fucking chicken for this man. Abraxis chicken. Chicken, God. Chicken. God. Yeah. Just a braxet chicken. It's got chicken.

Speaker 11:         02:58:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:58:16       No, I'm looking at my main for chicken. Abraxis it comes up right away. Let's see. Abraxis it comes up. Do an image search but the chicken doesn't come up. Do you want to name it? Emits emits. Oh yeah. I'm the images is one of them. Where it looks like a chicken. It's a fucking chicken. Well it's crazy though. It's a chicken holding a um, uh, a mallet. Yeah. One of those things. A shield on one side. Wow. What a fucking freak animal. Yeah, it's freaky. Jesus Christ. And what we, what year is this from? I have no idea. So they were high when they came up with that, right? Yeah. There's no other way I chicken with a shield. Chicken. God, how are you going to definitely take different, you're drawing a chicken. This chicken guy. Wow. There's all this crazy images of it where it looked like a, like a heartbeat or something.

Speaker 1:          02:59:03       No read it. Read the Wikipedia entry a little bit. Cause gnostic shits very strange. I just re read like a little passage from there. Cause it's really odd. It's like real mysterious. Oh, praxis Abraxis far more common in the sources than the variant from Abraxis on different boxes. It's all, they're using Greek Greek letters. The word, uh, of mystic, meaning in the system of the gnostic baselines, baselines, B, a, s, I, l. I, d, e s being, they're applied to the great art con and our Crm, our con one of the greatest, see 64 games. It really, uh, NASA cosmology and blah, blah, blah. The seven lower spelling, his name represent each of the seven classic, uh, planets. Wow. The Ne, the words, if it's the letters represent planets, the sun, the moon, mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The word was found in gnostic text.
