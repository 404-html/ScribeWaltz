Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Casting you fuck, you don't know what you're talking about. Your stream is producers, not the, not the best product, but it's free of shit has just as good as like tri quarters like those, those tri castors. So things are expensive as shit. Everything on the Internet. Now I bought a Garmin navigation anymore. You can download wave for free and it's just as good when I yeah, you can get a lot of free shit now. That's just as good. Like this pod cast bitches, we ain't charging the Joe Rogan experience, however, is sponsored by some awesome companies. But I'll tell you what, we're not sponsored by Grillo's pickles. It's past that shit over here. All people say to me, a QP took you to boot. Why is this okay? We've got a problem here because I'm not seeing anything. Let me refresh this and see if it shows where broadcasting, but I'm not seeing it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Oh, there's the image. Okay. Um, Grillo's pickles is not a sponsor. They're just nice guys. We met them when I was doing a zookeeper with Kevin James. We were, we were in the Commons and they had this cart where they were selling pickles. I'm like, who the fuck is selling pickles? Like what a weird thing to sell and I thought they were going to be like those seven 11 pickles. You know you get them in a bag of pickle juice and they're mildly good. These things are fucking ridiculously good. Yeah, they're fresh or hot. They got car lucky. They have garlic in them that you see like they have like, look at this. Can you see this online folks? This is like fucking swamp grass in here. See we, these mother fuckers are doing Voodoo with these pickles. This is big ass slices of garlic and as big as slices of Haba narrows and Jalapenos in there and then there's fresh pickles and these mother fuckers are ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       No one's paying me for this. This is 100% for bonanza for them. It must be great. Josh Joel fucking glove. I ate a whole container of these. I panic when I get low and they send them to you from Boston to me from Boston. They ship them to me. Are panic when I get low, I fucking panic. They're the best fucking snack ever. Guilt free. 100% guilt-free. Yeah. Cause they're eating cucumbers. The vegetables. I sit in front of the TV, I fucking smack the fuck out on these things and I don't, I don't feel bad. Yeah. Cause I'll fucking, I'll down a whole bag of popcorn kettle corn or I'll fuck up a whole bag of uh, like cheesy popcorn, popcorn with cheese on it or potato chips with vinegar and salt. I'll fuck up a whole bag and then I'll feel like a loser and I'll wait an hour and a half and I'll lift weights.

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       I will, I'm like, I can't be a pussy. I can't just go to bed on that. Like a fat slob cause that's step one to death. So I'll make sure I do dead lifts and an hour and a half when the potato chips of have dropped down. Good for you. But I eat these. I don't feel guilty if you're in Boston, you're first of all you're fucked because it gets too cold there in the winter and that Shit's ridiculous. And the women are to kind of tell it to high school up there, man, it's not the place. It's not the place. It's beautiful place. I loved it, but you know what? It made me me. I'm a wrestling and suck and weight in that winter. Yeah. Oh, it was good times. I did that as well. Walking around like a rail in that, you know the zero. Yeah. Excuse me. I'm in the middle of a podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       My kids, ladies and gentleman, this is why I have to get a studio. This is why my kids are crazy. The shine the children in the background is fantastic. There's always like a new home or just say, this is not really an emergency. My dollies, I fell off. We're going to have to glue it back on. Is it going to be okay? I'm pretty sure we can glue. It becomes a huge issue. I have. I have fake tea every, every morning now. Tea Parties or parties yesterday with both of them. My daughter's got to milk the cow to actually drink it too. You have to do it. I have to blow on it first. I'm like, God, I gotta go. She's like, wait, you have to blow my, come on. Yeah, but it's important to play with the man. I enjoy. Well, let's get to it through the fucking podcast first.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       This is not a commercial. Okay. We'll put this as a commercial. The Grillo's pickles things. This is 100% for free just because I love them and their pickles are fucking fantastic and the nice people. Anyway, the Joe Rogan experience podcast is actually sponsored. Where's that phone? Give me that phone man. Oh, Samsung Galaxy three. I got a galaxy three from teen and this is going to be one of our new sponsors. They, uh, they run 10 runs on the Verizon or the sprint network rather. So they have excellent service and there's no contracts and, and they have some dope phones, including the Samsung Galaxy three. So what does ting ting is out a new mobile company. It's like there's alternative routes. They rent space on a sprint. The way, I don't, I don't want to speak out of school because I haven't read their literature. But essentially what it is is they run on the sprint network, they rent the sprint network, but they take a different wrist in sprint does.

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       They, they rent a service and they say, listen, you know, we'll charge you by what you use. You can quit when you want and you're, you have no contract. So it's a way like better deal for someone who doesn't, you know, you might try this and go, you know, when a fuck droids I need an iPhone, I've got to get to at t and t I got to quit. If you quit, you don't have to worry about like losing, you know, like a ton of money or having to pay some contract breaking fee. And if you use less on one month, you actually get credit for it on the next month. So yeah, it's, it's a really good company. It's a good deal. And you know, cause they're on sprint, it'll be good service, but that they're not an official sponsor yet. So this is another non commercial commercial.

Speaker 1:          00:05:29       But I finally got ahold of one of these Samsung Galaxy threes. I had that there. There was good as it gets. Yeah, it's supposed to be like a giant iPhone. I need to find out. You know what, the operating system, just like, I need to read band hates these fucking things, but does he, he doesn't like droids there's and believe in him, but to me it's just computer people are really into that. They fall into different camps. Apples, you only way they get crazy. Well you want to get an apple, get a piece of shit. I stick with Dell. You're like, God, I'm not in your ward dude. I have no dog in that fight.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       He says blankety weird statements. He like, okay, I'm into guys fucking dummy dumped dumb. We are actually legitimately sponsored, only buy on it. That's o n n I t and a on as a company that provides me with a alpha brain. And um, I uh, I'm a part owner in the company when, so when you support on it, you actually support this podcast and support me. Why did I become a part owner? Because I 100% believe in what they're doing. The ethics are absolutely perfect. What they're trying to do is sell you the best shit possible for the lowest price point and make it as clean as possible so that no one feels ripped off. So when you buy 30 pills, there is a 100% money back guarantee. You don't even have to return the product. You just go, this isn't for me. I've read things online by intelligent people that are claiming that it's a placebo.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       I don't know how everybody's body works. Everybody's different. Everybody's body has a different reaction to caffeine and alcohol and cigarettes and vitamins. I don't know. Yeah, we'd for sure. I don't know how your body reacts to things, but what I do know is that all of the nutrients inside of Alpha brain have been proven to have a positive effect on human cognitive function. And there are studies behind that, and we're actually putting together our own study. It's about to go live. We've established a protocol and it will be a double blind placebo study at a legitimate university to show everyone that there is a, uh, a noticeable measurable benefit and taking nutrients. I 100% believe this. I've been a big fan of vitamins for a long time. I'm very sensitive to my body, especially when apples touch yourself. Very sensitive to my body. Um, I know when I smell, I know when I feel good.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       I know the difference. When I take fish oil and I don't fish. Take Vishal, I always talk about this for Jujitsu, if you take Jujitsu, there's two things that are musts, acid office and fish oil, acidophilus, healthy bacteria, very important case staff away. So important ringworm everything and colds as well because when you come in contact with colds, a lot of it is through your hands touching things. Well, what as a dot Phyllis is, is this yeast and milk culture is a very aggressive culture and it's, it's a mutually compatible with your body so you can take it and you're fine and it's all over your skin. Well when it comes in contact with some, some bugs, it just gangs up on, it beats the fuck out of the disease. It's like having an army. It's like having a healthy army. That Kombucha that you grab from my fridge, I, you never find my fridge unless it's got combustion.

Speaker 1:          00:08:36       It's never not stocked with. It's got great. It's got a mushroom bacteria. Yes. It's, it's got healthy things that you take in your body. Well, we have to realize that our bodies are not just your body. It's not just, you know, hey, I'm Brian Kelly and this is in my blood and my wall. Yeah. There's a lot of stuff in there. And the other thing that they are finding is that essentially your body is, is like almost like an ecosystem in its own with, it's made up mostly of organisms, most microbes and good bacteria and bad bacteria. And when you keep the balance of bad bacteria in relation to the good versus the bad, that's how you maintain good health. Absolutely. And Science and a lot of scientists now are working on cultivating the bacteria in your body so that you have, you know, only good bacteria or you manage it accordingly and that's the future in some circles of, of, of how you're going to be even healthier in the future.

Speaker 1:          00:09:27       What we're trying to provide it on it is all things that have a positive effect on the human body. All of our supplements like Alpha brain, shroom tech is another one. Shroom tech is based on the quarter subs mushroom and which has been shown to have a positive effect on your ability to simulate oxygen. And this was actually discovered by high altitude herders. They found that there, yeah, that their animals were eating these mushrooms and they were having more energy, that we're moving around more and there was a noticeable difference. So they started eating them. Yeah. And their, the way they grow them, it's fucking crazy. It's a fungus. They actually have to grow it on caterpillars. It's insane. It's insane. It's a, it's weird and it's really hard to cultivate and it's really fucking expensive. But if you use a code name, Rogan, you get 10% off any and all the supplements, everything we sell you is the best shit you can buy everything.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       It might not be the cheapest, but it's the cheapest we can sell it and it's the best shit possible. Like hemp force protein, hemp protein is the easiest protein for your body to digest. It's much easier than whey protein. I like way, you know, I love like muscle milk and stuff like that, but it fucking lights my asshole up like a canon. It's got a lot. I, I, it's hard to digest. Sometimes way is a, it's, it's not as nearly as easy as hemp. And there's some good hemp, there's like Manitoba Harvest. I've used that stuff before that's like a chocolate ham, but it cannot fuck with him. Force him. Force tastes so much better. And one of the reasons is because we use the best quality hemp hearts. We use hemp hearts. The best quality you can get. It's so hard to get that you can only buy 50 pounds of it a day.

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       So we have to put a new order in every day because he's hemp hearts. We can't grow them in America because of this contin government. And even though Vermont and two other states have passed laws, allowing them to grow the non psychoactive at all, I won't allow, the federal government said they would come in and arrest people and ignore unequivocal terms. We'll know what clearly they said clearly. They said they would put people in jail. It's fucking horrible. It's horrible to think about that. The you would arrest someone for growing as a client to be involved in enforcing. Exactly. So the marijuana laws have nothing to do with hemp, which is really crazy because you literally can't get high off him. That's another thing that people get up. Keep asking me. If you eat this, a hemp force, am I going to test positive for THC at work?

Speaker 1:          00:11:45       No. No, you absolutely will not. However, if you eat a poppy seed Bagel, you'll test positive for heroin something a lot of times, I don't know. Oh, 100% and that's what I tell about Olympic athletes and stuff. Yeah, well that's happened to people that have had a heroin tests at work. This happened to people who eat a lot of poppy seed bangles. You test positive for the same metabolite. Um, so you don't have to worry about that with hemp force, which is so crazy. We have to buy this shit in another country. We would on it would be willing to grow it in America, hire American farmers to grow it and, and give people jobs and help the American economy. But no, this and government with its horrible corruption and deep rooted ties to pharmaceutical companies literally won't even let anything close to marijuana. And if you want to read it, how closely tied they are to the pharmaceutical companies.

Speaker 1:          00:12:33       Pick up a book called the China study by t Colin Campbell, a phd who was on the inside of, of, of all this stuff and was on the national board of scientists. And it is a, he's a nutritional scientist out of Cornell University. It is a fascinating book, an expo say on how industry has hijacked skus than how you eat. Why the school lunch program? 28 million counting children. Uh, eat what the dairy industry, the meat industry and the sugar lobby wants them to eat cause it's big business and why children are suffering from diabetes and a host of other chronic illnesses. Don't take my word for it. Look at a credible scientist and real data to support what I'm saying. It is fascinating. This is a guy on the inside who knows all the scientists in the academics who've been, who've been, who, who can take money from the same corporation they're doing research for.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       The point is we're on a fucking pirate ship. So that's why hemp is expensive. It's the really the only reason it's a, it's a high quality food that we should be able to grow and grow in this country. We also sell, we just started selling exercise equipment. Oh, hemp. Hemp force also has maca in it and raw cocoa. Raw Cocoa is a very powerful antioxidant and Maca is a stimulates testosterone growth son gets that libido on kid just tossed around as a band. Yeah, it's going to be banned eventually. They're gonna want, they're gonna want the world filled with pussy. Do you really want horny men running through your neighborhood? You've never worked on a little dude. We're going to have to be talk about this as soon as this commercial's over kettlebells. That's what I'm all about, ladies and gentlemen. And we sell a host of kettlebells in packages at [inaudible] dot com and again, these bitches aren't cheap, but they're the best quality.

Speaker 1:          00:14:11       You can get as cheap as we can sell them. They are essentially canon balls with handles on them. They're fucking fantastic there. Troy. Kettle bells, they're the best we could buy. They have the perfect dimensions there. They're fucking so durable. You buy them once you have exercise equipment for life, they literally are a lifelong tool. They will never break their fucking iron cannon ball with a handle on it. Where is it? It's nice to get a kettle ball exercises online. Youtube is the best free. Youtube is free. We're going to, we're making a Kettlebell DVD that you could work out along with me with Steve Maxwell Cause uh, Steve Maxwell who was a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu, uh, as well as a, um, uh, like world renowned Kettle Bell Instructor and fitness instructor and just a brilliant guy. I love having conversations with them about fitness because I always learned something new.

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       I've been working with him for years and we make little videos on my cell phone. I can show me the exercise and we'll do a video. Like he, he, he got me through, he's got like a bunch of exercises that he's programmed for me. One of them was just a full body weight exercise routine where I did nothing but body weight. It's something I could do in a hotel with a towel over a door. Like he's really into like that. You can, you can do a full workout and it's a brutal bodyweight workout. It's fucking, you know, one legged squats and shit like that and one arm pushups and crazy shit. Oh, Hindu pushups, Hindu squats. And it's a ruthless, ruthless workout that you could do in a little room, you know, push, push a chair to the side and you've got a gym in your hotel room to kill yourself actually. So we're going to make d DVDs and a and have them also for sale and on it. So Steve Maxwell's in which I'm very excited about because I wanted to make sure that if I'm doing a video, I don't want to fuck anything. Buddies backup. I want us to shut up, fucking do everything wrong, my monkey ass and then have you do it, you know, so, uh, we'll have that soon. All right. And I'm going to record the, uh, the Joe Rogan a soundtrack in the backlog.

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       What's the soundtrack?

Now you use the code name Brogan, get 10% off any and all supplements at [inaudible] dot com including the hemp force and the kettle bells in the battle ropes.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       You sing that song? I was like, yeah, I was a while. When I woke up the morning I was like, I'm bored. And I was like, in June he goes, mom, friend, his name was Joe Rogan and I started breaking down your body. You might have like the worst sense of beat and rhythm ever do it. I'm the terrible thing is you're talking about, I have no words. I am the police. How many police put that to music so I can, so I can just revel in, play it on a loop in my car. I would be a terrible musician, dude. Why are we thinking about my body when you by yourself. That's crazy. I was soaking myself down. Yeah. And I was touching myself. I don't know. It makes me feel weird. Mixed feeling. I was feeling I wanted to be as thick. And why didn't you know?

Speaker 3:          00:18:25       Really? How about it? He stuck in why I can't go north to south. So I go east to west here thing. I'm meant to be carrying bricks and pills. You were always, yeah. Yeah. This is thinking about you. Even when I'm back in the day, you were always working out and you had just, you had big hands, big hands, long. Your arms are long. Legs are short, arms are long. Well, my legs aren't short. My upper body short. Oh, that's okay. It's actually, yeah, very weird. Yeah. It's built to bear to Harry rocks. Up Hills. Sicilian stone masons have to say, and what happened to me, I'm built for dance. Some of these trucks, all the rocks and I'm built for dance fucking employees. I'm built to gesture and emote. Well, that's one of the things I think I like about kettle bells. I feel like I'm working hard.

Speaker 3:          00:19:12       I just put in a fucking hard kettlebell workout, man. It's like you're, you know, you're really going to war. You're fighting something. It's not just like doing a bench. I've never done a really hard kettlebell work, but maybe you'll take me through. How dare you. You're in my house. Yeah. Maybe I'll take before I feed you the grass fed steaks that I got some grass fed steaks. You to a high right now, but we'll do it after a little too high to workout. It's the best time to work out. Fuck yeah, I don't smoke. You don't smoke enough wheat. That's the problem. You've got to get comfortable with the waves. It's like if you don't know how to surf and you get on a board in the wave hits you, you're going to fall on your ass. Why? And you're like, no, no, no. You just don't know how to handle the wave yet.

Speaker 3:          00:19:51       You've got to learn how to ride the weed waves the whole life. Someone's, when someone's high all the time, they can just handle being high. They can handle being hot, talking to a cop and then he ended up being high buying tickets at the movie theater. They're used to the boat they used to the front of the waves. Man, these that experience, I like that you lift weights when you're high, you feel your muscles may fuel your tissue. You do feel way more intense. Everything pops stretches better. It feels great when you stretch high stretching highs. It's like when you were all high two letters. Oh yeah. I do Jujitsu high all the time. Whenever you gave me, I feel I have good energy right now. Sativa. It's called sage cities sativa, Sativa. It's uh, it's all um, positive and energetic. It's not like a, I've never done standup.

Speaker 3:          00:20:36       Highlight this. Yes, you have. We got your high ones before I show. That's true. Oh, that's right. That was fucking, that's right. That was at the Ice House and I started talking about saving a baby that was trapped under a smart car show, Shanghai before every show. Man. For real fuck around. Why fuck around lately on stage, I've been, I don't know if this ever happens to you, but I'll get up like just a winkling have an idea and I just start following it on stage and sometimes it just starts forming itself. Other times you're like, where am I going? What are you doing this weekend? You got gigs? Yeah. I'm going to be in a, actually, I'm glad you remind me. I'll be in Vegas at the Paris at the Paris was a great new room and I'll be there Thursday, Friday, Saturday come out, it's court court, Mcfarland's Corp and gallons place and quarter Paris and it's great. And the court will be middling for me and I can't wait man. I had a great time in Schaumburg. Thanks everybody is Schomburg and thanks to Joe Rogan because a lot of people came out because they listen to this and um, it was, it was, it was amazing, man. I love, I love those crowds. I love that room is great room. I love Chicago. There's so nice. Yeah, they're great. They're just polite people. They're better. They're better than us.

Speaker 3:          00:21:44       I love the way you said that you looked down. Now they're better than us. They are better than us. They're real people. They have to deal with this all winter, which soft, softer on the belly. There's something to be said about, about having to deal with the winter. They, they say that the, the, the people in the north developed faster and, and technologically because they had to get ready for the winter because they, the winner was something you had to develop a sense of time. You have to figure out how to harvest store food and all the things that come with that. And it required a higher level of technology and a higher level of sort of planning and, and, and in some ways, uh, uh, uh, discipline because criminals are way smarter on the East Coast. Yeah. Well they're organized. It's called the mafia because those aren't the smart ones.

Speaker 3:          00:22:25       The Russians are the smart ones. The Russians, Chinese, you don't know. Yeah. The Russians and the Chinese keep their fucking miles calls. The Italians start reality shows like mob wives. You imagine if a Russian chick tried to start a mob, wives show they would kill that bitch. But these weak ass guineas are letting these fucking dumb broads go on TV and spelled all their nonsense, basically indicting them when an entire life of crime. You know what you're getting into when you entering this life. Oh really? So you're admitting your husband's a fucking criminal on TV. You dumb cunt. Is that what you're doing? What you're doing? I don't want to you if you are in a criminal empire, okay. If you're involved in something like that, you can't go on a reality show and just make light of it. Like it's no big deal to be fucking mob wife because I guarantee you there's some shit in that guy's past that he's denied and then he would say, none of them.

Speaker 3:          00:23:13       I'm not a lifetime criminal and this, you got a wife on TV to your real guy. You're a real mafia guy. Your wife doesn't know a damn thing. They found, they found the Chinese, the head of the Chinese triads, they said in New York and you know what he'd been doing for 15 years selling, uh, so that at one of those pushcarts Jesus Christ, that was his cover. She's squaring off that they're willing to take it to the sodas. Not fucking, it's warm. Gimme Your fucking mic. Cold Soda. Let's go. He's the head of a try and he was dealing with that everyday. That's hilarious. Ran The triad when they had that whole Gadi thing going on in New York. I remember going, what is going on? They can't arrest the mafia guy. Like this main montage, the Teflon. Don, where's this? I remember thinking like met and spent a lot of time with his lawyer.

Speaker 3:          00:23:58       Really? What's his name? Can't remember his name now. It's make this buffer, buffer counselor, counselor, counselor, something like Katar. No, what other Bruce Cutler. Cutler maybe. Anyway, he looks like a big gorilla. I thought he was an Italian guy. He was Jewish. I'm Jewish. I'm from Brooklyn. I don't believe in violence, but I was a wrestler. He was a wrestler and he never lost, he said, but he was at really great guy and Oh, what is his name? What is his name? We got to Google. Okay. Um, but he was such a good guy and we had so much fun and I'm really it. Bruce Cutler or Bruce? I don't remember. Uh, yeah, he's a great guy. He's got a great sense of humor. Um, and, uh, and he was just talking about how defending somebody, you know, is that they're going to send you with for a thousand years.

Speaker 3:          00:24:42       I'm, I'm going to defend you. I'm going to do everything I can. And uh, you know, but he says it. He said, yeah, Bruce Cutler, we said about God, he said, he said, I've, I've, I've, uh, I have defended some very formidable men and that is the one guy who really lived what he spoke, what he said. You know, I was into ever tell you the story about being in little Italy in 91, let's call it, and uh, it might even be, yeah, something like that. It was, I think it was even met 90, and it was early and I was at, and he had a, I can't remember the name of his social club, but it was right near a restaurant called Cafe Sorrento. And we used to go there and right next door was the social club. Oh, come on, what's called mall. And I'll never forget, and that's where God, he and his boys used to hang out.

Speaker 3:          00:25:25       And you'd see these just rough looking dudes with earpieces and, and they'd stayed, the car would pull up and stuff. And I remember I was eating and the outdoor cafe was with this girl and I saw these two dudes in suits with open shirts, raven, Raven night shows and, and Catholics went to was right next door. And I remember seeing, um, these two just giant men walking out on their way clearly to do, I could smell it, I could see it clearly to do something bad, clearly do something like, you know, and I remember looking at how big and formidable they were and how they were basically professional knuckle knuckle breakers. And I thought to myself that that would put the fear of God in you, that that's, you better be ready for guys who are going to, you know, because the cops are gonna come and then they're going to grow and those guys are going to wait.

Speaker 3:          00:26:14       They're going to come back. That's right. That's what their job is to get that done. That's right. They go like this, they go, hello and I say, have a good evening. And then they come back and the whole place is burned down. See you soon. Fuckface Susan Saturday and mother for me. Right. Yeah. It's a very scary thing to have. Uh, organized crime. Well corporations in technology actually actually um, took a big bite out of organized crime. Couldn't shake down local businesses anymore cause they weren't, they were all cs and things. It's interesting, the Raven Night Social Club is now a shoe store. Oh Wow. Yep. Wow. It's shoes and purse and the, and the way they brought down, brought down, got it. Ever hear the story. The guy who used to run the Raven night social club managed it and he was the guy who took care of cleaning the tables.

Speaker 3:          00:26:54       Everything else. They send a cop in there. This beautiful woman, she was a cop. She banged them on the table and as he was having, as he was banging on the table, she put a mic under the table and that's how, and that, that is how she took one. She took one for the team, took some fos guy, took some cock bang, put it under there and grouper brought the whole thing down. I wonder if she came. That's a good question. One of she was like so like turned on by the fucking scandal. She was a sexual patriot. Wow. And absent she'll, patriot is a new distinction there it is. I've never heard of a sexual patriot before. Oh by the way everybody, thank you for making man thoughts with Brian Cowen number nine yesterday. Thanks to the Joe Rogan podcast. Cause I know a lot of you guys are just going over from here to there.

Speaker 3:          00:27:39       I mean that's Kinda crazy but love you. I started talking about the 10 minute podcasts. I started talking about my podcast the next day, the next day. He's like, dude, my, my, my, my buddy was like, you're number 13 dude on iTunes. I was like, have you ever seen the youtube comments whenever we request people to go look at a video? No. It's hilariously whatever. Like, I've recommended like an Allman brothers song the other day, and you go to the song now and for the first three pages, it's just says like powerful Joe Rogan, uh, all of garden butthole. That's awesome. Yeah, it's hilarious. Joe Rogan sent me. Yeah, it's ridiculous. What, what do you think is the, well, I mean, your podcast is to become a bit of a phenomenon and you know, as long as I've known you, the one thing I know about you is that you've never ever lied.

Speaker 3:          00:28:28       You're just an authentic dude and you, for better, for worse, for better, for worse, you were always the guy. And when you were young, it was so inconvenient. If you didn't like somebody at that, in that circle, you'd be like, I don't know if I'm like, you, I like it. So there it is. I mean, it was basically that, are they figured out real quick that you just had a problem with you? We're willing to tolerate some really ridiculous people in your life. And, uh, I loved you and I'd be hanging around with you and I'd see all these problems in your life. And it drove me crazy because it wasn't just that I didn't like this guy. I was mad that this guy was wasting your time with nonsense, these idiots and liars and frauds and dummies and you didn't want to hurt their feelings.

Speaker 3:          00:29:08       So you accommodated them. It's right and I was offended. I was offended by them. I was offended by them for being so weak. The run this week game and then you were accepting this week game so they didn't grow. Do you know, do you know a lot of young people listen to this and one of we know what I figured out after a while and why don't, why don't do that anymore? Why don't suffer fools anymore is because when you, when you suffer fools like that, what you're doing is actually taking your time away from and from real people. People's do design at the time. Exactly. You know who are not imposters. It's not good for them either. The fools. If you let a fool before they have to be a four by saying that you know the, the, that's who they are and you just accept that they're never going to grow.

Speaker 3:          00:29:47       And I don't know if they can grow. I don't know what their potential for growth is, but we're not going to fucking find out if you tolerate them. You can't do it because you lose all your energy. It takes, it's actually a form of high tech procrastination. If I think back on it, I think a lot of it was just pie tech procrastination. We do as human beings, astonishing things to ensure our own failure or to at least ensure that we don't realize our potential tension. And we do crazy things like have a family with three kids that we, and with a woman we don't like or, or, or take a job that we have to take because we got a hold down this massive nut we create for ourselves when what we should be doing. And actually it's turning pro. He talks about this a lot.

Speaker 3:          00:30:30       Pressfield, Pressfield, you know, and the war of art and the war of art. It was so we do these things, it's very hard and I always tell people, I say, if you really want to try an exercise, just, just it. Ask yourself if you couldn't fail, if you couldn't fail, you can get anything you want. Just make a list of what you really want in technicolor and, and see what it does to you. It's hard to face up to it. You know, a lot of people have like competing like notions in their own mind about money. You know, they, there was psychiatry talking about how you have all these weird things like money, money buys. You can't buy you happiness. It's the root of all evil, right? But we all want money. So we within our own mind, we had these major conflicts of interest.

Speaker 3:          00:31:09       Whenever you bring up the word money because it ha it conjures up both negative and positive images in us. That's interesting to me because you and I know that if you make enough money, you can do a lot of good with it. You can make a difference with it. So everybody should be trying in some way to be, it's not just about money, but trying to be the best they can be. Cause you'll make a difference. But I think within ourselves, part of the human problem and something you have to face it, but as you get older is the fact that there are a lot of contradictions within your own mind because they'd been given to you. You know? Um, it's, it's really hard sometimes to just have because you have to actually think you deserve it. And most of us are conditioned to be guilty about having too much, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:31:53       Yeah. Well there's a lot of people in this country that feel like it's okay to be angry you because you're successful. There's a lot of people that will sell it go fucking rouge as lots less in this country than other countries. And I'll tell you why. And one of the strengths of our country is this. And George will has a great, he gave a great speech about this. Um, the, the, the great thing about America is that all of us out there, no, and I hope we're not losing side of this because in some ways you can get cynical about the way this world is wired now. But at the bottom line is a lot of Americans know, I may be poor today, but if I do the right thing, I might be rich tomorrow. And that sense of potential in the American character is what drives this economy. It's why we're so innovative. That's all well and good as an ideal. But the real problem has nothing to do with America. An ideal. The real

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       problem has to do with weakness of character and people not liking people who were successful. Yes. You know, I had a friend who will remain nameless, but he's a very nice guy and he's a comedian. He's a sort of a, a bit of the self hating nebbishy type. And he said, good, it's you. You're always doing this with your body. Like why? You know why, why? Why have your why have all these muscles? Why, why being shaped like, why are you so concentrated on that? Like for real, I go, if I gave you a pill and that pill, all you could do, you could take this pill and you all of a sudden you're, you're a super athlete. You're a person who's unlike 99.9% of the people who run the street. You're a martial arts expert. You could choke people. You could kick the shit out of them if you wanted to.

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       You can defend yourself. Wouldn't you take that pill? And he goes, yeah, I would. I go, well, that pill is just hard work, right? If you do hard work, you'd become that. And See, I did it without a pill. Consistency. So it's the same thing. It's like there's nothing wrong with being in shape. The only thing that's wrong with being a chain, because if you're not in shape and you see a guys in shape and you see a woman react to that guy and shape in a very sexually attracted way, it makes you feel uncomfortable. So you want to pull the goal back. You want to make the game easier. You want, you don't want to compete with this guy. You know, and, and it starts with like I always tell people, you know, but first, first ask yourself, be honest with yourself man. Sit there alone and ask yourself what you really want.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       I mean ask you some detail then don't go. Don't like if you have to get your phd or something ridiculous. Don't, don't look at the top of the mountain. Just take an action every day. I don't care what it is, one little action and, and that's what I do like just take, just keep taking. It's like working out. Show up. I don't give a shit if you start with five minutes, when you show up to you develop momentum, that's it. When you start to develop a momentum, the human being relies a lot on momentum. It's a weird habit. We're obese of habit and momentum. And when you that have a habit of working out all the time, if I don't work out for a few days, I feel super uncomfortable. I don't feel good. You have to, you have to exercise on a regular, regular basis. And when you do that, you develop momentum.

Speaker 1:          00:34:47       When I write a lot, I'm writing, I get on a momentous sort of a wave and I, I feel good about it and it becomes a part of my habit. That's Ya. You'll have to do is make, give yourself positive habits, positive habits. These accesses the habit, by the way. You're right. Yeah. Be Proud. Be Proud of, of getting work done. Be happy that you're getting work done. I mean that, that is what you do. You know a lot of people also remember you surround yourself with a lot of people who don't want happy for you. Then I actually your friends, but what they are is their comfort. They're creatures of comfort and not actually your friends. And I think it's important. Sometimes you got to change your fucking gang change. We're one of the reasons why you and I were such good friends when I met you.

Speaker 1:          00:35:25       It's like you, first of all, you were the, for the closest guy to me I've ever met in my life. I was like, Holy Shit. Here's this guy who's like exactly like me and you required nothing. You like you, you had no like what? Man, you're not going to come to my birthday party and you weren't. There was not no creepy dummy shit in there. And I had just gotten out of a friendship where I had to kick a guy out of my life because I was friends with them when I was broke. And then once I got on television he got really fucking jealous and he said a lot of dumb shit. I asked him not to give away my phone number. I said I have two phone numbers because I've always had like a media phone and in the regular phone because when you do media like you, like you do radio shows, they have to call you back.

Speaker 1:          00:36:09       And I want to have a phone where if I pull it out of the wall I don't give a fuck who calls, you know, so I have that phone. So I said, just do me a favor. Your friend who by the way just cut out of a mental institution, would you do me a favor? And just give him my other phone. He doesn't fucking care about you, man. Just cause you, you're on TV. Your friend just got out of a mental institution. He's fucking crazy. All I'm asking is if you're going to bring this crazy guy into my life by connection given the media phone and he went in the school, you think you're such a fucking bad ass cause you're on TV. I'm like, what is this? What are you even talking about man? I'm asking you not to give your crazy friend like number.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       That's it. Yeah, that's it. And all of a sudden it has to become some attack on, you know, and I'm on my success. And it was a, it wasn't even a big success, it was just part on a sitcom. But you remind them of what they're not doing. And a lot of people go into this notion of scarcity, this idea that there's only a certain amount of the pie. And if my somebody else is doing well, I'm not going to do with, I'm not even thinking that all they're thinking about is themselves and not looking at us as giant picture of resources. All they're doing is just like being a baby. All of a sudden is what about me? I had a friend who got apart and as he got a part, you've got a part in a sitcom. His girlfriend started crying. I'm never gonna get anything. What about me? Like this guy just got a part on a sitcom. He was so happy. He was like, I can't believe I got it. I nailed the audition. I got it. I worked my ass. Man.

Speaker 4:          00:37:37       Woo.

Speaker 1:          00:37:40       Don't date actresses, actresses. It's part of the song. Very strict. No head shots, policies. It's very always steal that. Cause I, I uh, I went through my head shots phase and I, uh, I just stopped doing it. Yeah. You, uh, you learn, you know, you don't want to date anybody. It's just fucked up as you are. That's very bottom line. I don't want to do it. I can manage my fucked up in this. I don't want to introduce yours and the other, the downstage. I was talking about my daughter and I was like, I just don't want her to date a guy like me. That sounds so I got to play a character for the next 15 years. So she imprints on and that's somebody different. Yeah. Well my friends had a of good do if the start date and girls or started dating boys.

Speaker 1:          00:38:18       I'm like, guess what? Girls like boys. That's it. Boys like girls too. The only thing you can do is this. Here's my philosophy. It's good. It's, they're supposed to like girls and girls are supposed to like boys tell them with the right values and a good mind, they're gonna make their mistakes. That's, that's all you can it afraid of their child. Make sure if they're, if they're looking up to a yogurt like Kim Kardashian and just give an alternative, they're not going to look up to that dummy. It's real. If you don't fuck your kids up, if you raised them like they're friends and you talk to them and communicate with them, they're not going to be attracted to something as stupid as a life of Kim Dash watching you. I'm watching you with your first daughter and you were, you would talk to her like an adult and when I would talk to him and like this, cause I didn't, I didn't know anything about play.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       I play with my kids but I talked to them and I think kids know a lot more than you think. They know. You know, I mean I, I'm, I'm down to play princess. I'm down to pretend Santa Claus is real. I'm down for pretend. But when it comes to emotions, one of the first things I do whenever I catch them doing something wrong, like they hit each other or yell at each other, I always tell them that I did the same thing always like one of them bit her sister the other day I go a bit, a little girl when I was five I got in trouble. But some girl in her hand, she was sticking her hand on my mouse. I'm like, fuck you bitch. I better. Yeah. So I told her after first, after the first three times you put your hand in your mouth on my mouth and watching her little four year old eyes like look at me and realized that I used to be dumb and did a lot of like, it wasn't just her daddy and wasn't just an adult.

Speaker 1:          00:39:52       At one point in time I was a little child as well, just like her. And I was telling her like, I very remember biting this girl and it was very traumatic. I shouldn't have done it. And the girl was mad at her mom was mad and I felt like an idiot, you know? And her mom's like, why didn't you just slugger? You didn't have to bite her. And I'm like, I'm sorry. It was just felt like fuck. I mean it didn't even break skin or anything. It was just so dark. The worst thing from me, the worst times in my life, I can realize, remember, was when I was embarrassed. Do you tell your kids this? Really, I haven't told my daughter that it was old enough now to understand anytime there's any sort of an issue. I think that's one of the most important things.

Speaker 1:          00:40:31       The same with my stepdaughter was an old, older boy. He's done the same thing with her. Um, she's not, I mean say stepdaughter, she's my daughter. And um, and when, well that's why I communicate what, but what I communicate, whether it's the same thing, it's always gotta be that the human beings, you're giving them the benefit of the doubt actually they have the same mind is we do, they don't have context. That's exactly what children, and when you bring them into your world like that and you communicate with them their, then they'll bring you into their thoughts as well. It's amazing how much my four year old just opens up and talks to me about how she feels about things. What bothers her. And do you think that you have a, I was just talking about this with the, I just recorded something with Jay Moore on my podcast and I asked him if he had a primary cra question that runs through his mind every day.

Speaker 1:          00:41:17       Do you think you wake up with a primary question? No. You don't have, you don't have one overriding question. No. Join Myself. That's, I don't know. I think this is a journey. I just think this is a ride. Absolutely. Look, it is, it's temporary. It's not going to last. I just want to enjoy myself. I want to be, uh, uh, amongst friends and have a good time. Have a good time doing my standup, doing my work. I have a good time doing Jujitsu, hanging out with my boys at 10th planet and John John Machado's having a good time driving around, listening to music, being nice to people. Yeah. I feel like, you know, we're all a little too small and this giant universe to take ourselves too serious. There's no benefit in it. There's no benefit and self, grand jury. There's the, the benefit is in friendship. The benefit is in fun.

Speaker 1:          00:42:02       Laughter. Can I, I'm so psyched about you coming over here. Like we talked about this, our families are together. Uh, Brian's wife's here. Um, we have, uh, the kids here. I've got steaks. We're going to play some music, listen to some music and drink some wine. That's what life's about. That's what life is about. Having fun. I say that to you. I said, we are going to mark our lives by the number of times we laughed at each other and we're silly and, and we're, we're, we're just surprising and shocking each other stats, but it's about Stan Ho. Ba and I were on the phone the other day and he was drunk and, uh, and he's like, you know, I could quit standup but I couldn't quit standups. He goes, I can't. He goes, I don't need to do comedy anymore. He goes by that. I never want to stop hanging out with comics cause you know, he and I were just on the phone.

Speaker 1:          00:42:42       We're just laughing and talking shit and laughing and laughing. He called me. He was listening to the Jamie podcast, Jamie Kilstein podcast. In a, in a, in a van filled with other people, like it was on, on tour and he called me, it sounded like a comedy club. He goes, I just want to tell you, we're listening to you right now and everybody has something to say. And then new, like he holds up the phone and all the comics and the vantage screaming and cheering and applauding. Jamie Kilstein had said some crazy shit about tosh shouldn't have said that. Rape Joke. And it was like he went captain feminist on people, so standup call and then I called them back and we're just laughing and he's, he feels like he's self so fun. That's the kind of human beings you're supposed to be in contact with. Joey D is every time I'm hanging out with their original, what a stamp on life.

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       That guys, he's just great. I mean he just, he looks over at UFC and I'm, I'm sitting like literally like six, 10 chairs away and he goes, he just leaves him in. There's no drama, no drama. And everybody's like, what the fuck is that guy saying? I was like, no drama, no drama. We would do it at the end of the world show with Joey Diaz, Doug, Stan, hope me and god, and a band called honey honey.

I would've come after that. I met Stan Health and I'm a big, yeah, I'd love to meet him. He's a great guy. He's the best. I don't important.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       He's so important to me. He's like, he's a real guy really doing it. He's refreshing and he's 100% legit. He's a 100% legit, hilarious headliner comedian who's just really into continuing to do that. I'll be occasionally, reluctantly, he's, he's, he's a little real deal man. I was talking about Jay more today and uh, and he, I said, yeah. I said, what's your, what's your definition of heaven? And I said, to be honest with you, man, I think it's just being on stage and doing stand up. I don't think I'll ever take time off away from me. He's like, what are you going, when are you gonna Retire? I don't think, I think I want to be don Rickles. I'll be 85 years old. The one fucking standup because we're not just so much fun and what else could I be doing finally? Something else that's really fun.

Speaker 3:          00:45:16       You want to go skydiving when it, Nah, I got, if people still want to listen, I'll still be doing it. And when they don't want to listen anymore, when you're doing like half filled shows and the people are barely, then you're like, well maybe it sounded packet in. But then again, maybe it's time to go back to the drawing board and come out with new stuff. Well, it could be. Yeah, for sure. I mean, it could be that it could be a lapse, but for some people it's the end. You know, there's a lot of people that get fat, get fat in the brain. They have to, got to keep feeding. I always tell like young comics, I'm like, feed your brain. It's important to read everything if you can or as much as you can you you, and keep asking yourself the next question.

Speaker 3:          00:45:51       It's how you stay dynamic. It's how your material will grow and it's how you will grow as a person. You know, one of the things I've been getting, nothing but great feedback about this podcast I did with my dad. Well, my dad's 72 what my dad continues to do and what I respect about him so much as he continues to grow. I watched the 72 year old guy taking Italian and going to Italy for three weeks and throwing himself into a town. When the fuck is he going to use it? Talions yet he doesn't care. He takes it reading these obscure things on quantum physics and stuff. He's just always so because he enjoys it. I think what people have to really, the reason why that's shocking to people is most people feel like there's a destination. Well, I'm going to reach retirement and when I reach retirement then I'm going to change.

Speaker 3:          00:46:33       There is no, there is just now there is just life and you should think about the future, but your primary concern should be now it should be a life and what do you enjoy doing? Do you enjoy learning things? Do enjoy reading? Do you enjoy isolation? Tanks are fucking hikes or workout that stuff. And by the way, here's something for people to say, well I can't do that cause I got to put money on food on the table for my kids. You'll set a very, very good example to your children. If you're following your dream and what you're supposed to be doing that children pick up on, that they can pick up on whether you're you're doing drudgery or you're doing something inspiring for yourself and it'll make your household better. In my opinion. That's easy for me to say, by the way, cause I'm not having to pay bills all the time so I don't want to, I don't want to be too disrespectful that people who were actually trying to just make some money and figure their shit out, but just keeping in the back of your mind that you know, just just find some people get an easy ride in this life.

Speaker 3:          00:47:26       We all know that. Some people get really lucky and they get an easy ride in this life, but that doesn't usually last. Most of the people would get an easy ride. If they don't earn it, they wind up fucking it up. That's true. Almost always true and your ride is different than anybody else's ride as my ride is different from anybody else's ride, but you gotta except that instead of being mad at other people's rides, you got to only look at what you're dealt. What is the hand your dealt moved from there? Don't worry about this guy who's fucking rich prick. He's born in new floor. Could Richo said it's nothing to judge [inaudible] he's got all this money. Could think she's or that is not your concern. Okay, that guy's got his own problems. If you concentrate on him and hate on him, that is wasted resources.

Speaker 3:          00:48:12       When you should be concentrating on is what hand where you dealt, you know, well, I'm not so good at math, but you know why and I think I want to be a rapper. Be a rapper. What? Concentrate on yourself. Concentrate on one hand, please remember also, this is so important as I get older, this is, there's no doubt about this. Anybody who you admire who's really good at something, whether it's to drums, Jujitsu, math, whatever, please know this. They've put in at least 10 years of really hard work at, not always. Not always. You know what I'm saying? Some people are prodigies, but quick, but anything, anything that you, anything that you want to get good at, you're going to have to put daily practice into and should always do it for the sake of the practice, not the result you get. You get just as much like somebody, somebody said, well I don't know about the time I get my psychology degree.

Speaker 3:          00:48:57       I don't know if I get, look, you're going to be, while you're trying to get your psychology degree, you're going to be meeting people. You want to be around who are dynamic and interesting cause they're gonna be doing the same thing you're doing. So it's the fun starts almost right away. Well it's, people just get scared about longterm goals and longterm commitments. It's like, just keep working. You're going to keep working anyway on something. Right. Are you just going to stop moving? You're going to work on feeding yourself. You're going to fucking move forward. Tim Ferriss said something interesting in his book. He goes, my goals, I don't set these 10 year goals. I set three month goals, six month goals, nine month goals, 12 months goals that that's a good way to do it. You can get a lot done in three months. So you know, just something simple.

Speaker 3:          00:49:36       I don't set any goals, you know, never, never set goals. I set objectives like as far as like what I want to get done in days during the day, but I, my goal is to be doing what I wanted to do and I'm already doing that. Oh yeah. You've always thought I don't have any, but you've always had very clear notions. I'm talking to you, you'll go, I remember you going on to start my own TV show, my own TV channel. I remember you saying that before the podcast. Then you were like, Duh, I'm going to do a podcast. So you get these ideas and the difference between you is that once you get an idea like that, like once you're into something, whether it's a video game or a sport, you're a, you're a co Ku Cooper about it. Fucking cuckoo. Like, I'm like, what are you doing? He goes, I just finished practicing quake for 15 hours. I fainted. I'm like, well, how about I'll do it for an hour and 15 minutes, 59 hours. I fainted. I didn't get any water.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       That's you. Well, I grew up completely obsessed with martial arts and that mindset of, uh, the, the practice of martial arts, which was defining for me, let's look made me a human being. It was the first thing I was ever really good at. That became the, the way I live my whole life and live life like you're about to, you're about to do the most dangerous thing you could ever possibly imagine. So you have to be obsessed with it to get really good at it. I can't, not again, like half ass something. I get crazy. But why do you think you would be good at standup? Will you a class towns? I didn't think I was kidding. I didn't either. I had a very specific idea that the only people that laughed at me with the people that were these sick fucks that I trained with because those are the people that taught my friend Ed shorter and my friend Steve Graham, Steve Graham is still one of my best friends to this day.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       When I was a little kid, I used to make everybody laugh at the top of my middle school. I would do these impressions of my instructor having sex with one of the students. I never did any of that. I would do it like, you know, in their, you know, in the voice and with their accent shit and it would be like one of our friends was your intro. You're currently what? The bluebells Korean. Your instructor? Yeah. Well it wasn't, that guy was another guy that actually make fun of who is like more of an assistant. My instructor was Korean and he, we really respected him. He's an amazing, still an amazing guy, one of the most influential people in my life. But I used to call fellow students as him as a, as a chore. You know, my friends would freak it. They'd be like, Hi sir, how are you?

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       Like why is he calling me? He never called anybody. We definitely have that in common that we used to do impressions of people that we knew. Yeah. That's what's like the first kind of humor. You recognize something goofy that someone does and so you repeat it and I'm putting my ridiculous scenarios, but my first comedy came from high school when I was in high school. I was not a funny kid. I was a much more troubled kid then I was funny, but when, no, but I was an artist and when no one was around, I would go into Mr Homans class. Mr. Holman was this really wacky science teacher. He's really fucking crazy and I knew how to draw them all and I had a character choice. Forget that. You're really good drawer. I always forget that. Oh yeah. I wanted to be a cartoon art.

Speaker 1:          00:52:40       I mean I'm a comic book artist. I dedicated a lot of time and it was one high school teacher that's sucked that completely turned me off to it. I was like, I can't do thank God for him. Yeah. I think thank God for that. Could be not, I mean, I wouldn't have enjoyed being an artist. A maybe I wouldn't have had to, you know, be so, uh, I can't see you in a sitting in a, at a drafting table all day. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know. I enjoyed it though. I really enjoyed, uh, illustrations. Um, uh, what was my point? The, by the way, illustrations are hypnotic, aren't they? I mean, you can paint all day. Like I know painters who set this guy, I can't remember. Damson ain't going to make me go off traffic, Mr. Holman. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I just have to remember this. So what I would do, my first stab of humor was I would draw pictures of this dude on

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       the board, like pictures of him, but fuck. And other students or, and then there's a guy named Mr. White who's this really short dude who just got back from Vietnam and he was fucking crazy. And Mr. White, I always drew him standing on a chair or standing on a stool, always drew him standing on top of something. And it was always screaming about nom, you know, and uh, people would fucking how, and I would put it on the chalkboard. I got suspended because I drew the Spanish teachers, Penta teacher wore like a ton of, make unbelievable amounts of makeup, like, like a clown. And then I drew her like her face with all the makeup and then I drew a werewolf. This is her without makeup and fucking food was really good, like fangs and slobbers I knew you were really funny before I'd even seen you to stand up.

Speaker 3:          00:54:07       We were at the EOC and, and you were sitting there and we were on a bus. We were going, we were going back being shuttled back something. And this is like back in the day when Randy couture, like had his first fight. And I remember somebody goes, well, Joe, what are you going to do tonight? And he goes, and you were like, ah, I think I'm going to get in a horse stance, pushed my balls into my body and read Nietzsche with a Bandanna around my head. I was like, yes, that's my favorite. Kind of tends to wash downs. There's a lot of dudes who thought they could do that. They don't think it pulled her balls into their body too. And I used to try. What are you talking about? Just nobody was more obsessed. The only person more obsessed with martial arts. Then you want me to put your balls anywhere?

Speaker 3:          00:54:46       I can't do any movement with my balls. You have to push him in. Have you ever tried Tantra? You ever tried like squeezing your, you're, you're strengthening your core muscles so you don't let any come out. Does that work? Could you make it stronger? They look, it's what every guy does. Who doesn't come right away. Okay. That's what the fuck it's called maturity. It's learning how to, I remember being younger and just fucking say I, the minute I smelled a girl, I'd come. I'd be like, oh fucking God, don't move out until late. Isn't there some sort of a physiological benefit to not orgasming and letting your body like assimilate the commonwell the essay, the idea is that fighters, the Samurai and the idea is that you can boost your testosterone and apparently the semen goes up your spine. Not True at all. Not True at all.

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       But believe me, I believed it and used to say it for years. I remember one time going, no, we used to not, we'd go with like two weeks without jerking off or her getting late and would just make you really feel a really aggressive, I wouldn't do that. I try to cook two district science on fight science. John Brenkus that that show, they had guys not have sex for like a week or something and they measured their testosterone and then they had him like calm and stuff and and there was no difference. They actually, they actually have tested different scientific fight sciences. Not the fuck they're talking. They don't have shown there's a physiological difference, but it only lasts for seven days. After seven days it normalizes, but for seven days you get a higher level of testosterone. It's like your body is like, come on last chance to not be a pussy. Let's go get some, c'mon, c'mon, let's go get some. I would think that your buddies crews more testosterone to develop, build sperm, but then again I'm not a fucking doctor. I think it's also

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       to increase your competitive drive in order to get some more pussy. It's like your body recognizes like that you haven't scored, you haven't tried to reproduce so because you haven't tried to reproduce it buys like listen, let's fucking amp this gorilla up, get them fired up, ready to fight in case another male comes along. Yeah, yeah. Cause Cause Pussy scarce like in Alaska or Boston. We're, hopefully you and I will be. Yeah, we're going to go, you're going to stop coming. I'm coming. I'm coming hunting with you and I and let's, let's, let's, let's move this conversation over to, to a little show called pig man. Holy Shit. Talk about that weaponry. By the way, 40 of them I've talked to Rinella about an IA. Fucking hates that show. Steven Ella, who's the guy who's the host of meat eater, he helicopters, dude. But he's a fair chase hunter.

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       I mean he's, what he does is everything he does is like stalking. He stalks his prey. He doesn't wait and tree stand with a pile of food lane this and then blow them. Yeah. Oh, that's what we're going, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Oh, he's an animal. You got to go. He's, he's a great guy to a very intelligent guy. He's not like you ship a girl, you know, just look hood and you know, he's a, he's a guy who, it's very sacred to him. The whole, the whole, like he went to a ranch once, they put him in a tree stand and then he said, well at 6:00 AM the deer come around. Cause that's when we, that's when the feeders opened up and he realized there was electronic feeders and it's like, I can't do this. He wouldn't do it. Whereas like Ted Nugent just fucking launches arrows to those pitchy.

Speaker 1:          00:57:50       I mean, he literally target practice. It's basically pigs. It's actually domesticated pigs that became feral. Well, the pig man shows different. I mean, they're actually reading the diary of a pastor. Yeah. They have a real problem to like poor people. Yes, yes, yes. They give the meat, the needy families and it's good. Neat. It's good. Well, it's wild pork. It's delicious. But the, uh, the pigs are a huge problem. They destroy crops. They, uh, they run, they spread disease and when they plant the seeds, they go in, they route and they pull the seeds out of the ground and eat the seeds. Pigs will eat anything and they're fucking huge. So they have to radically cut them. So in Texas it's legal to hunt them from God. Does cons are, I don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, they just taken these fucking pigs out while the pigs are running.

Speaker 1:          00:58:40       They're blowing their brains out and the pigs do flips. They killed 200 pigs plus and 10 coyotes on one show. I don't like, I like coyotes. Why would you like ladies good cause you imagine if your baby was outside by itself and the coyote came along. How do you think, how do you think that would work? I don't even know. Eat your baby every coyote near your baby. Fuck himself. Every Kyler that ever lived, I will put a bullet in his fucking brand on, I have great pack structures there. Cons could fuck good hunters. They beat and cock suckers. Each and every one of them.

Speaker 1:          00:59:17       He make up anything to fucking kill, to kill something like they babies. I have proved leave a baby alone. Coyote, coyote shovel. We kill guy was called baby killing baby killers. That would be a satisfying show if you just left a baby in a pen in the middle of a street and the coyote is just come around and you pick them off a sniper rifles like, hey, deserves it. This motherfuck was going to eat the baby. The baby. He was coming from the baby. That's good. I'm not in the coyotes. I when your dog gets eaten by a mountain lion, it's, you have a different perspective to me and hit you. Oh, well I haven't had those before. Yeah, pimples are great. How about when you come home and one of them killed the other one? Yeah, that was a lot of fun. Living Room was a puddle of blood.

Speaker 1:          01:00:00       The dog I told you to adopt, she was actually the coffee table. She was with Taylor, a coffee table with tea. She was a crocodile with a wood foot, long legs. She was actually a crocodile. She, she had a crocodile head and she was clearly half crocodile, sweetest dog about. I called. He's like, Oh hey, this is one. We were completely retarded. I was like, Hey, get down here now. I knew cause I couldn't adopt him cause I had, I had a female, she was so sweet and you're like, I'm taking her there. Talk loved me. There was a problem. She loved me and she didn't want the other dogs around because they would get some of my loans. It's devastating to, and I want you to fight. She would fight to the death. She was ready to fight to the death over you petting. Did she ever do frank?

Speaker 1:          01:00:39       Only pimples to find other man like male females. They fronted. Yeah, it's bad. It was bad. I had to, I had to put them both down. Put Frank down to you get tired of that shit. Right. They both tried to kill each other. It was horrible. I couldn't trust him. Frank was like devastated after it was over. She won. She beat the mail. She did. Yup. Yeah, I left him for dead. He was all fucked up. He was in the hospital for weeks. Yeah. Yeah. I never, never thought that they would fight and never thought the mail and a few, I would separate the females, but I never thought the mayor would fight with a female and they fought. You know what, they fought over the pool guy. The Pool Guy came over to, to clean the pool. They started heading there pending the poor guy pet one of them.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       And she would fight frank if, if uh, if she wasn't getting pet. Yeah. Well she got fucked up man. When she was in that pen or in the pound for awhile, she was fucked up cause it was one of those shelters where they didn't kill the animal, they'd kept the animal around and she was a fighting dog before that. So she was a fighting dog and then all of a sudden she's in the pound and then all of a sudden she's at this house and this guy is super sweet to her and loves her and pet her and feed her food. And she said, these other dogs you got get the fuck away. I don't want to lose this. And it was, should have been a great pet on by our own but with the dog to on yours. That's my experience. I've always had, I had two pit bulls for years and I've had different sets of them and they just, they just try to kill each other. So good. So good at getting like choking them out off each other. But I just, I they'd be fighting. And one time I was on a date and piggy and my, my, my uh, my fucking German German Shepard, this working dog, this bad ass fucking dog. Okay. That I like found this candidate and he was like a long line of just nothing but IPO and shuts on sport dogs. This dog was a fucking wolf and by the way had knock out drag out fights

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       with my dog piggy who is a pure pit bull and a fight and dog and this dog held her own no problem. Meanwhile, I'm on a day me, why would you let them find out how and how do you know the day, but there were two females. I want you there when it happened. Oh, did, what would happen was I'd come home and it looked like Vietnam. There'd be from everywhere blood everywhere and they both be like, and basically half dead. I'd rush him to the vet, they'd be like, that'll be $5,000. I was like literally. And so Nate fight sometimes I was on a date, this girl is beautiful. I remember and all of a sudden I just here and I come running out and all, I think his vet bills and they just gotten out of their cones. They used to walk around, they looked like like Nixon and a baseball combined.

Speaker 3:          01:03:01       They literally just looked through jowls and like stitches heal because what you're saying is the role of swell up. They had to shave him and then they'd had these crazy stitches on the shaved heads and necks and just swollen with these jowls. It was awful. The Giles because fees, I'd have to train it. They had the fucking pills and they were in these cones and knocking everything over and and so they get in a fight and I was, I was in the front yard for 20 minutes trying to break them up cause I choke one off. Then that one would lose consciousness and then the other one would get, get a hold of it and then I have to choke that one. I'm dealing when we're getting kind of 20 minutes and my hands after and my buddy came home, Bob, my buddy came home and actually helped me break them up.

Speaker 3:          01:03:40       20 minutes later we're all fucked up. My hands were so I, I've been trying to like fight him so badly. I was literally fun for my lift. My hands couldn't, didn't work for for a week. Go well, you're a pussy garden hose. Uh, what to separate some readily tried it many times with my dogs and they were like, ah, this is just cooling us down in their mouth in their mouth. Guess what? I talked to the trainer. He goes, yeah, sometimes when you do that, some dogs think that's the other dog is doing it to them and so they fucking go harder. Yeah. I had both of those don't stick. It does matter because they'd be, hold on. Remember when we went to that guy's house who was a he? He raised fighting. Pitbull's got one of his puppies. The advertisement said, this is how returning to an hour, the advertisement said pit bulls.

Speaker 3:          01:04:26       There's no bullet. Our pit bread right out of the box to Joe and I were like, fighting dogs were in your stupid like Reem, possibly fast, accurate or some shit. And we're just, we drive forever out there. This guy's clearly a dog fighter slash criminal slash whatever serial killer. And I buy this dog even as a puppy, wouldn't let go of your shoe laces. And it really looked like a beagle. It was really weird. It was a small dog. So anyway, Brian can't take this dog. He has a dog for a little while, but it's just too much work. He's really irresponsible. He doesn't. So he gives a dog to his friend on the farm and the, what does the dog do? Oh, my friend called me and goes, hey bro, your dog's no longer with us. I go, what? He goes, yeah, I had to shoot it.

Speaker 3:          01:05:09       I said, why? He goes, oh, I don't know. Well, let's see. Got Ahold of the baby cow. Um, and then, uh, well no, I'm sorry. Let me start again. It killed one goat, then another goat and that go, got caught up in, it's in, it's a rope. And then started bleeding as it died and then the cows started moving, so the dog was like, oh baby cow grabbed on that. Then the de the neighbor did German shepherd came out to protect the cow and your dog broke both his legs. Okay, it's pine legs and he said, and I had a 55 pound dog that looked like it was a hundred pounds. It was so full of blood. It was just, it was just so swollen with blood lust. And he said, I'd never seen anything like it. It couldn't get it off then. Then after the German shepard goes back to the cow, the baby cow.

Speaker 3:          01:05:51       So my buddy is trying to get it off the baby cow and you have to, you have a real responsibility when you have a dog white though, those dogs, they have too, too much of a history of blood lust. It's too hard for them to break. Pray with people to hell on wheels with four, four legs, great with people. You just, if you have a dog like that, you have to have it in a secure yard and you have to be with it all the time because otherwise you've got a monster. You used them to hunt boar or fight other dogs. That's what pimples or the way that's also pigman either see when they have them that way they hold them down with the dogs and then they cut the things. It's not as crazy as the watching the helicopter shit. The helicopter thing was insane.

Speaker 3:          01:06:29       The whole show too. It's a whole half hour show. Those are military style weapons. It was like he was talking about this before with a fully automatic, when they hit the pigs and the pigs are running and then they would do the somersaults when they would like brain. Um, and then the pigs, pigs would go face down into the mud flip. It's pretty fucking nuts, man. One pig, they get to this one pig, this giant boar and he fucking turns, stops running and faces the helicopter, like face down the helicopter. Look at this motherfucker. No Way. They opened up on them and then you see twitching kickin and shit. They got him in the water. Some of them went in the water nice. And as her in the water, don't, I don't talk to them. You see their heads explode in the water. Like this is the most carnage I have ever seen on television and Mrs fucking crazy to watch.

Speaker 3:          01:07:18       You know, and they're, they're fucking redneck. So they're hooting and hollering while pay 10 Nigga was like, people think you should be illegal. It should be illegal not to do it. He's not exactly a middle of the road guy. You don't kill a hundred pigs before breakfast. You're a communist. Just fucking shooting, shooting at them out of this. He was having a great time. Yeah. He was like, if I always too many bullets, Mrs Nugent will divorce me. I was in Portugal and I saw a bull fight and I was surprised at my own reaction. I got really mad at how they were treating that bull. It made me feel really bad for the bull and I was fucking actively rooting for it to kill one of those guys. Will they do and every now and then they do the last one when the guy had to kill it to shoot it, you know, don't hurt it.

Speaker 3:          01:08:00       You've seen the horn with the horn goes through the guys. It's the crazy shit I've ever seen in my life by the way. He, I think, I believe he came back and fought like, couldn't find any more, but he fought a symbolic thing and they were all cheering for him. That's a bad ass. And you want to read the definitive book on bullfighting and it's really worth it. It's called death in the afternoon by um, by Ernest timing the way it's an amazing book. One guy had it through his mouth, through his lower jaw and coming out of this mouth. Yup. That those guys, that's a bad ass. That's a bad ass sport. I will. It's not a sport, it's a crazy custom that you custom vent to customers. It's one of those things where you could invent it today. Do you know that the law in Spain, you can, you're not allowed to approach a fighting bull on foot as a human being.

Speaker 3:          01:08:45       You have to approach it either on bicycle or in a car or in a motorcycle. Why? Because those fighting bulls are smart enough. They can, they watch, they watch how you move and they learned very quickly. They learned very quickly how so the first time at Bullen inner ring sees a man. It's the first time he's ever seen a man on, on two feet. So he's not, he does not know her moves. And a, there's a whole thing that they do with that, you know, that's important. You don't want to have that uneven fight. Did you know, you know, they used to pit lions and also bears on with both the short and bear baiting. Guess, guess, guess who won every one of those fights? Now the bowls, I mean the bullets when they'd have bulls against the lion or bulls against a bear. Oh, bowls, bowls won every time.

Speaker 3:          01:09:25       Every time. Jesus. Every fucking time. That's what Hemingway says. And the things they, they, they, they, they, you're, you're not, you're not fucking with, uh, with, uh, they can lift the horse. Speaking of which, speaking of which, did you see the youtube video of the bull elephant that took the Mack truck got under it with his tasks cause he was mad at the Mack truck cause he fell out of it and, and flip that shit over. He fell out of the truck. Yeah, they were trying to load them on the truck, I guess any fell out of it and was like fuck this. And he got under that Mack truck and it's a real Mack truck and flipped it. So turn to right over on its side. So do you have any question of how strong, and by the way, they weighed 10,000 pounds. A bull elephant weighs 10,000 pounds.

Speaker 3:          01:10:10       Ladies and Gentlemen, Jesus Christ, that's big enough for you. I wonder who would win an elephant or a bull and they're really smart and you can train and do all kinds of crazy shit. Well what's really smart about them as the memory there, they can see another elephant which all looks the same to us, but they don't see it for 10 years and then they run into it. They run towards each other and hug each other humans too. That's crazy man. They know who you are and they don't like certain people. And I was in the San Diego Zoo and I was watching them. We paid extra to go and see them, how they clean them and how they, you know, teach them to bring, give them your, have to say you can check them and stuff. So they always have a barrier and they're no joke. There's no a video. Is there a um, it's gotta be yeah, there's no, uh, it's not elephant. I think flipping Mack truck or something. Yeah, just put it on or flipping drunk. Elephant versus drunk elephant.

Speaker 3:          01:11:01       I had to do it for a, I did it for a true TV. They sent it to me. Oh really? Well what is it like, I'm assuming the DVD, what is a true TV? Like a show or something? I just thing called world's dumbest. Like world's dumbest. Oh, like one of those things where you make fun of people, comments, like make comments and stuff. That stuff's on the way out. I think so, yeah. TV something way out. It's doing well though. All those silly shows were on the way out. Well, what do you think is going to replace the Internet? Yeah, yeah. What's that mean for us? It means that a podcast man, thoughts at Brian Callan I got to come up with, that's what you're calling it now, man. Man. Thoughts change it from the council to, ma'am, I can label it now. Oh, we couldn't label it the Brian [inaudible] show before.

Speaker 3:          01:11:46       This is more specific and it's kind of what I think about I and I, and I'm, you know, a man thoughts can comprise a lot of different things, but I'm trying to think of what I'm going to, I've got to make some tee shirts that I would wear because I, you know, I don't know. And not that I didn't want to sell them, I just, I'm just gonna like I'm particular about my tee shirts. How about just a little tiny Cox over tiny ones? Let's see. How about an image and the image? Really cool image and image of Ronald Reagan, but it's all made out of Cox. No, I should've called my podcast Cox. Cox, Dick. Fuck, that's a funny name for a company called epic but doesn't, um, someone has deke house or something like that. That's a Knoxville. Yeah. Yeah. My Buddy, my buddy is doing a movie with them.

Speaker 3:          01:12:33       You can get away with that. It's weird. Like I watched a CNN the other day and there was a, there's a band in Russia called Pussy riot plus your ride and pussy riot broken to a church. They got arrested, they got arrested two years and yeah, they got, they got sentenced to like two years in jail and so everybody was having a demonstration and they have these giant signs that say free pussy riot and here CNN, it's showing this on CNN and I'm sitting in front of the TV and these giant signs say free pussy riot. And I'm like, wow, that's hilarious. Like what a weird loophole by the way they, because they called it pussy riot. Yeah, they have to, they have to show what these guys, that's blatantly obscene, but it's on the news. You know, I was on a plane one time and the guy started having an argument with the stewardess before we took off.

Speaker 3:          01:13:27       All of a sudden he's just saying he's not being a dick. He's just saying some things like, well, I'm not trying to cause a problem here. You know, as I'm like, oh there's a guy, I'm going to cause a riot, whatever. And so next thing you know, Marshall's or on the plane, they take them off the plant and what's going on? Well, you're not allowed to use the word riot on their certain, we have certain trigger words that we have to report. Uh, because you could have been a terrorist. We were trying to incite violence and this is the kind of fucking bureaucratic shit we deal with Jesus. That's what happens when you had these blanket laws and these absolute rules. It's like fucking laws. It's too, too much ridiculous how many pages the, and I'm reading a book about it and I think it's not a bad, not such a bad law.

Speaker 3:          01:14:05       There's a lot to like about it. But you know how many pages the Obamacare act as you know, how many pages in the bill? 2,420 now who reads it? Nobody. Thank you. That's a good and especially you don't read. You also don't read the clauses you put in there. Who reads it? Uh, the, the uh, handful of reporters from the New York Post who put out a book called landmark that I'm reading now that really explains what the Obamacare bill does and what it means for us. Listen that the thing about bills or the, they'll sneak shit in that has almost nothing to do with the name of the bill just so that they can get it in and stuff they've been trying to get in before. My father said, the best thing about it, my father said Washington, he spent a lot of time on Capitol Hill and he said, and this is a podcast.

Speaker 3:          01:14:47       He goes, Lushington isn't the business of intent. What that means is that you have a bill. You want to create universal healthcare or do you want to do whatever? You know, these are good ideas. That is the intention. Whatever. What happens with a Goliath of Goliath, like Waa, like the federal government, is that there are so many vested interests that find their way into that law. So if you want me to vote for it, that's fine. You got to do something for my constituency, which means I've got to put this clause in page 500 no one's gonna read it anyway, don't worry about it. And before you know it, that law that passed, just like the marijuana laws, there was a cottage industry that grows up around those laws that have a vested interest in keeping that law, no matter whether it makes sense or not.

Speaker 3:          01:15:33       And that's what happens. That's all of a sudden everybody's drinking out of the government trough. It comes down to very simple questions, not Republican or Democrat. This is why you say, do you want the majority of our resources in Washington under this massive roof? Or does it make sense to spread the resources somewhere else? That's the big question, and I happen to believe it's better to keep resources out of Washington because something that big can't help but create. The real problem is you can't untangle it. Now. It's so far. Everybody's got their hand in. Do you think, do you, how do you, do you know the kind of tax breaks at pharmaceutical companies get because they own the FDA. Nobody else can break into the drug business. You know why? Because they own the scientist basically that say Yay or nay. It takes, what, 12 or 13 years to get a drug patent?

Speaker 3:          01:16:23       You've got to go through all the tests and they're, they're scientists. Go, wait a minute, I've gotta be very careful. They all take money from Pfizer, et Cetera. Of course. Well, that's what we were talking about before the podcast. When it comes to our hump force, a protein, it's, we have to buy all of our hemp Canada because the pharmaceutical companies have bribed these fucking corrupt politicians and made sure that it's illegal. The federal federal government, the state government voted for it and the whole thing is supposed to be that states are allowed to make their own laws. The federal government is not supposed to interfere with things along these lines and they don't give a fuck. They'll put you in jail if you just grow hemp, which is a cousin of marijuana. So let, let me tell you another story that's really interesting. A friend of mine unfortunately has pancreatic cancer.

Speaker 3:          01:17:08       I lost my other friend to it, um, about three months ago, but suddenly my friend's mom, step mom has it and, and she went to a doctor, doctor gave her up chemo protocol. Uh, just like with my friend was given a chemo protocol and these are very good doctors at a very well renowned hospital. Um, and the drugs costs a fortune. They fight. It wasn't working that well. They finally get into this, the most famous, the most famous doctor in the world for pancreatic cancer at Ucla, who's chemo protocol is a, extends a lot of lives, way beyond what you're supposed to pancreatic cancer. He said, basically, he said, why are you on this? He said, he said, he said, oh, I'm going to change your chemo, um, and it's going to be a lot cheaper. And they said, what do you mean? He said, well, Eli Whitney put out a, uh, something that costs $30,000 a year, but it was the exact same thing as the generic drug or whatever the, the other chemo is that was $300 a year.

Speaker 3:          01:18:03       But Eli Whitney cleaned it was better. So every doctor to this day, I'm going to just follow me. Every doctor to this day, um, prescribes the Eli Whitney drug, which is 30 times more expensive now ready that Eli Whitney was challenged in court. This doctor was one of the people that say, it's, it's bullshit. It is actually not as effective or not. It's this one, which is much cheaper. It's been around much longer. It's just as effective. Eli Whitney paid a fine for it. It was worth it to Eli Whitney to pay that fine and be dishonest because people still stay. They're not following all the tort laws. And then I follow him. All the cases, doctors, all of the countries still prescribed the Eli Whitney drug, even though, even though it is not as good as the one they could because they don't know anybody better because they thought, because Eli Whitney hired this huge marketing campaign, they thought that's the drug to do now is the real problem is that nobody calls him on it.

Speaker 3:          01:18:57       That's right. Well even if you do, it costs them $20 million when they make billions of dollars. So, so again, these are massive companies that, that don't really, that have, you know, have basically hired who they want to defend them and behave inappropriately. I'm being, I'm not saying all big farmers bad, I'm not saying everybody's there. I think anytime you have four major players and nobody can get in your fucking industry, it's not good for capitalism. It's not capitalism. It's not a free market and it's not good for our health and it's not good for humanity as a whole. So there the, the, that's what it is. A real problem is how do you untangle it? I mean, there's so much money invested in keeping Gov's only one way. There's only one way. You've got to starve government now. That's, that's where the libertarian notion of the Cato Institute basically says there's responsible tax while you have to have some taxes.

Speaker 3:          01:19:47       Uh, but, but you, the only way, the only way we're ever going to get out of this and not become western Europe or worse is by, by starving that that massive Leviathan of resources. Yeah. It is a problem when you create a bunch of different government jobs, like, you know, there's a lot of people that rallied to keep drugs illegal and one of them is the unions that control guards, prison guards, prison guard unions, and they spend a lot of money from their dues that they get from their workers in order to keep drug laws the same. Yeah. Because that's what keeps them working and what's not a philosophy. It is self-interest. Yes, absolutely. Self interest. And it's scary. That works. It's scary that that would be allowed. It's scary that that doesn't prompt. I mean if you were an insider trading guy knew, just knew that some company was about to go under and you got rid of your stock, you'd go to fucking jail for that.

Speaker 3:          01:20:41       How come you can't go to jail for that? How come you can't go to jail? Because you are, you're, you're, we are working to keep drug drug laws, which everybody has shown a ridiculous and most people believe are completely ridiculous despite the massive amount of propaganda that you do, the way you do it. You, you, you get yourself informed, get yourself informed, get yourself organized. And what happens is it takes a long time. But pretty soon more and more people start to say even about don't smoke weed. This is a ridiculous law that's puts so many people in jail for a long, long time. Not only a taxpayer stance, it's ruined families and everything else. And, uh, when are we going to come to our senses and realize that this should not be illegal? And, and if you get enough people behind the politician, things start to change.

Speaker 3:          01:21:31       The way you do it though is through information. And also I, I, my biggest problem with government now is I feel, I don't feel like I'm represented. I just feel like, well, you're not, yeah, the no one is anymore. I mean, Obama's not even represented. That's where special interests are. That's, that's the problem. They're supposed to cancel each other out and they're not him as a human. He's not represented. I don't, I don't think that guy has any say in what the fuck happens. I really don't. I think at the whole thing is completely ridiculous. Without Congress. I mean, you know, that's not necessarily a bad, I mean, but you don't necessarily want a president to have too much power. But the president sets the agenda and the upper, the president's responsibilities always to do a, set the agenda. But also also at the end of the day, there are a lot of decisions where he's presented with six different options from six different interest groups and he's got to make a decision and piss off the other five.

Speaker 3:          01:22:18       Yeah. But he's don't, don't show in front of the camera, Bro. That's disgusting. I know I got, I got, I looked at that pickle and I was like, I've got to have one. You can't do that. You can't chew it. A microphone. I know it's a little bit about the United States won't, they won't tell you that. It's probably Nsh redact this. Uh, this William Binney is, this guy was the NSA mathematician that I was telling you about earlier. Um, I've been obsessed with this guy since we have had David Seaman on, on Monday who was a congressional candidate in Florida and this former NSA director after nine 11. It, this guy is a mathematician, you know, um, one of the world's renowned math mathematicians. And what he did was create a method for the government to, uh, track dangerous individuals and track people and, and, and, and book.

Speaker 3:          01:23:09       It turned out that the government just used it openly on everyone. And so he had to leave. What a surprise. They just decided to just literally every phone call that you make this guy's correct. And he is the guy who fucking coated this shit. If at every phone call that you make, every text message you make, every email you make goes into a database and the government is in Utah building a gigantic structure that will literally house everything you do, say, watch online, all your Internet history, all that shit will be stored. So if they ever want to just anything they want to know about you, anything, all they have to do is just pull that. Shut up guys, if you want, if you want to see somebody who really sat around and thought about this stuff and made the argument for why that's not good, just youtube.

Speaker 3:          01:23:53       Milton Friedman. Well let's before that, before that, let's not get people confused. Let's let's have people just check out this story and the guy's name is Benny, B, I n n, e y, and just go and read up on this because just this alone, it's going to fuck with your head and what are they doing on some important chopping wood? No, you hear that banging. That's like someone's going to drum fucking lives. They think they could keep the kids from banging on a drum in the hallway. No, that's passive aggressive shit right there buddy. That's what that is. They don't, they don't like the fact that we're in here having fun while they were out there with the kid screaming. No. My mother used to do to get my father to get back to my dad for years. The household I grew up and my dad would always travel and pain in the ass.

Speaker 3:          01:24:36       A lot of pressure and everything else. My mother would, uh, she'd always have part of the house being worked on by man. She just have part of the house always not in repair and love that shit. And my father basically in a bad mood, it wouldn't know what it's like, oh, I'm just having the kitchen redone for the second time. They didn't know. They love doing that. They love it. They love like changing things change. It's different. Like you could, you could live in a log cabin. Easy. Right. Me Too. I was in college. It was three guys. Okay. We didn't do the dishes for one month. We had, we had sprouts growing out of the train for real. Okay. Finally did. My girlfriend came over and she was like so appalled. She goes, I have to clean this. I can't take it. I can't be around here.

Speaker 3:          01:25:17       And it smells like a greenhouse. You know, guys are guys are pigs folks. So this binny guy, you gotta, you gotta there's, there's youtube videos. If you don't want to, uh, to sit and read something. National Security Agency, whistleblower William Binney look into that because this is, uh, we, we, we've turned a corner in our society where this is a, it's an us against them. Shit. It shouldn't be. And remember also that every, every totalitarian state and every state that took control and power over people used, used national security and, and domestic security and the threat of terrorism, et Cetera, as an excuse to take away your liberty. It's so old schools. You would think they've always been done. I would think that that generation had already moved out of business. You know, I hate to think that the generation coming up is going to go business as usual because in my mind, this generation, the generation that's of age of adult age now grew up with the Internet and that generation is a different group of human beings, vastly, vastly different than anybody that grew up in the sixties or seventies, two completely different animals.

Speaker 3:          01:26:32       Thomas Jefferson said that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. And part of, part of that, what he's trying to say, I think in a lot of ways is that you, you may have your freedom, but just know that it can be taken away from you, uh, a lot faster than you think. So you've gotta be very aware of the signs read. That's why you read history, cause you perspective and you're real and you can, you can recognize patterns and destructive patterns and destructive. But nobody saw this coming. Nobody saw the ability to do this because my mother saw it coming and there lots of them monitoring their, the NSA had mathematicians. There are a lot of people that saw this company I talked to about the fact that it's already going on and let's, William Binney had stepped out and put his book by the way.

Speaker 3:          01:27:13       They broke into his house and stuck a fucking gun in his face to the FBI, came into his house and it, and he never did anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. The whole thing is crazy. We have a that just to really fucking creepy, corrupt, corrupt government being in control of that which governs you, which is what our country is based on, has always been a very tenuous, fragile arrangement and it's gotta be defended every minute of the day and they just need to stop. It just needs, we need to, we need to have new people in government and with this new, the new transparency that exists because of the Internet, you're going to be able to still run things, but you can't run things as corrupt as they had been running forever and everybody just wants to keep doing it. Just like we were talking about circumcision or bull fighting or anything.

Speaker 3:          01:27:59       That's ridiculous. It's old. It's in nature. It's government. It's not people. It's the bigger it becomes, the bigger it becomes. Government needs a job. And what does that job to either tax or pass laws, both of them. Of course the measures you, you, you are going to have them. The bigger government grows, the more history shows you, the bigger government grows, the more, the more you know, the more power they get over you as an individual. And that if just pick up a history book, man. Yeah. But is there a way to pull it back? That's the question. That's, that's the biggest question. That's the biggest way to run things. There's a way where people pay a fair amount. There's a way where we keep a real military that keeps us from ever being at the mercy of an evil dictator or an evil country. Is there a way to do that and still be a good country and still not be completely and totally corrupt? Yes. Or is educate yourself and you and you get informed, educate yourself. That's not going to stop them from running over. You have to make you have that much power. You've gotta

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       vote you gotta you gotta make noise. Is Voting real well? If it is, why did Ron Paul, I mean, why did he lose two states that he clearly won? Do you know that there's a, there's plenty of evidence online and this plenty of videos and show that show in Maine and there was one other state were Ron Paul should have one and they, they, they hit it, they covered it. I think that is that our voting process is fairly, it's actually compared to most parts of the world compared to most parts of the world. Did you see hacking democracy? No. Hacking democracy makes it very strong argument that the Bush Kerry election was bought that if you watched the video, it's a documentary on Hbo when they show that they engineered in a third party entrant into these voting machines and the guy on the show Diebold had to change their name and I'm Diebold anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:29:47       There's something else. The guy on the show showed how he can alter the results of, of any electric. Doesn't surprise me. Yeah. So what do we do? That's a good question. The Internet. That's what I think. I think the only thing that's gonna save us is the young people coming up know that this is a different world. Know that this is a world that if you're going to be a politician, you're going to be completely, you've got to be transparent, everything's going to be transparent. Every move you make and you can't get away with doing things that we've done for for decades and decades before. It's a totally new game. Yeah. That's the only thing that's, it makes sense to me. You know, the idea of overthrowing the government like that, is that a really fucking necessarily like everybody's getting bonkers about that. Throw the government, first of all, it's, it's not a whole other thing.

Speaker 1:          01:30:27       There are ways to overthrow or change the power structure or make it smaller. What's also people recognize in this country, especially that we are the cops. We are the military. It's not the actual elite is these creepy bankers and there's only a fuck on small handful of them. And if the military doesn't listen, and if the government doesn't listen, there's, then it does take your phone away from the table, please take your phone. Yeah. It's making that [inaudible] if that's, if we do that. Yeah. So the phones, um, especially a CDMA phones or a GSM phones, there's a signal that picks up, it's good. It does it in your car. Sometimes they were doing your car and you're staring up. He goes, oh, that's my problem. That's your phone, your phone. It's, it's, it's at and t phones if you, yeah. If you had Verizon and wouldn't do it as easily.

Speaker 1:          01:31:17       So it's sort of a different frequency apparently. You know, CDMA is a, an older frequency. The frequency of the Verizon uses, but apparently it, uh, it's different in that, uh, it's, um, it's more robust. It goes deeper into buildings. But more countries have GSM. Like my iPhone has both. So if I go on the roads, Verizon phones, so if I go on the road, if I'm an England, it'll work in England because they only have GSM. They gave up on our stupid CDMA. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Um, but just, I just, uh, when, when it comes to these, these fucking conversations, they always seem so circular. Like they never really go anywhere because they're frustrating because you don't, you don't really know what the hell to do about this problem. That that's, that's what's scary about

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       it. And that's, that's the biggest threat is the growth of the state. The real question is, does, does voting really work anymore? And it voting. Those are good questions. We've got a real fucking problem. Really good question. Because what you start to realize there's not a major difference between candidates. Is there, I mean, did they, all of a sudden you go, well, there's not a big difference. People are disenfranchised. I mean, people aren't voting, uh, young people aren't as angry or in the streets because there's not a, you can't really necessarily make a difference. Maybe that's how people have always felt. I do think people felt that way in the 60s, actually, which is why they gotten to the streets and they tried to make a lot of noise, but that either I have the amount of movement that we have today. They didn't have the ability to do things.

Speaker 3:          01:32:40       And I's governments were taken down with Facebook. I mean, Facebook took down governments, Twitter took down. Different ones are, a lot of people are arguing and making very good arguments like the Cato Institute, this Libertarian think tank about what, that's why sometimes you just say philosophically, philosophically nobody wants people to go hungry. And so philosophically though, as government gets bigger, more and more people will start manipulating and getting their hands into the cookie jar. It doesn't do anybody any good man. There's no way. There's no way to stop that. Once it gets to a certain size, manageable governments should be treated like a necessary evil, not this massive socially social, uh, machine that engineer's equality artificially. It can't tell that never has been able to do that. And it's not, it shouldn't do that. Oh, gross was at Obama's statement. If you have a small business, you didn't build up by herself.

Speaker 3:          01:33:34       Well, exactly. You know why? Because he's never run a business and themselves that, that's my, my knock on that guy. Don't think he's a bad guy. Don't think he's not a smart guy. I don't think that guys, I've lived in the real fucking world. He was a community organizer and an academic. I don't want that guy running running shit, you know? And if, and if Romney wasn't so crazy with his religion and stuff, I, I would be like, well, he was kind of a stud businessman, but I don't even know what he stands for. He hadn't come clean with the tax returns. He's a fucking Mormon. He's a Mormon. He's an old creep. He's a creep. His wife was made out of plastic. His whole family lives in the dark. They're crazy and he's just going to do whatever the fuck they tell them. I always tell people, if you want to know about Mitt Romney, there's a video online where he gets confronted by a guy in a wheelchair who needs medical marijuana and Mitt Romney shrugs this guy off like he does.

Speaker 3:          01:34:22       Lisa, of course, I don't believe in medical marijuana and he just gets away from the Jesus' robe. But I will say that in, in Massachusetts, the guy actually spent a lot of time on the other side of the aisle and got a lot of shit done, including universal healthcare and balancing the budget. You can't take that away from him. And by the way he was a stud. But you know, Bain capital good and maybe create a lot of jobs. I don't think that, but I don't want to let the federal level, I don't think you get them that kind of, maybe not. I think you can really be a real governor. I don't think he can be a real president. Uh, I think when it gets to that level, when it comes to, especially with things

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       like war government, some have to do state governments don't have to worry about war. When you get to a federal level and you're dealing with multibillion dollar contracts and dealing with, you know, the pullout of the truck from Afghanistan. When I was telling you I talked to this, my buddy who's a real CIA guy and, and I had him do my podcasts and I called him Mr Pink cause he just was like, you know, it was really weird. He's so smart and he's, he's really the real deal. And I said, what do you get? Gimme gimme some stuff about the Iraq war. And then we went in there because of this and that. And he goes, man, he was like this. He was like, yeah, I mean I guess you could say that, but really, you know what I think it is. I go, what? He goes, I think it's just a bunch of interests that get together and it snowballs.

Speaker 1:          01:35:34       And before, you know what a lot of people are gonna make a lot of money on this notion and a lot of people get an idea and somebody picks up on it and they just assume it's true. And before you know it, you got this fucking machine that ain't going to stop for anybody. And he was really kind of matter of fact about it. And I was like, Geez, this is an inside guy who spent seven years there and here he is telling me this. He goes, he goes, listen dude. He goes, it, they spent $100,000 importing sand in so that they could play volleyball in the desert. You're like, Oh yeah, we talked about this once before. How much corruption, how much waste there is. And you know, we've all heard of the $500 hammers and all the stupid shit that you know were, it was unknown accountability, man.

Speaker 1:          01:36:14       No accountability. What's government? You know, the idea that it's all tax money. And what I saw with the banking industry, I mean, investment banks used to have to gamble with their own money and then they became public and all of a sudden they're using your money to experiment. And you had these cowboys who were like, let's fucking leverage it 40 times. I'm being simplistic. But that's kind of what happened. Well, Benny was talking the mathematician who, uh, the NSA guy was talking about other things that the NSA had funded to try to do the same thing. That didn't work, that they spent billions of dollars, billions of dollars, dollars of your dollars, by the way that they don't. That's the craziest thing about your taxes. You pay whatever you pay. 20% of [inaudible] goes. You don't even fucking get, you can't even request it. You can't say, hey, I would like to know, you know what?

Speaker 1:          01:37:02       How much of my money you're spending? Is there a website I could go to? Like maybe then I'll send it to you, but you could go, oh, hey mister Callan. Yeah. Well you paid $70,000 in taxes last year and your money went to [inaudible], you know? No, yeah, go fuck yourself. They don't even make it up for you. There's like, there's it. Just take it youtube again. Besides it's Beeni guy, also youtube, Milton Friedman, who wouldn't want to know about prize for economics and just just youtube and listen to his debates. Just listen to those debates. It's really easy to follow and all. He talks about his personal liberty. They go, you're a conservative, cause I don't like that word. I'm, I'm, I believe in liberty. So whatever I am, I'm very liberal. It's weird when you, when you go conservative or liberal because people like to attach themselves to ideologies and they will find a, like an area where they can operate in. They feel more comfortable being a liberal. Then you feel more comfortable with being a conservative and they just the, they're there. They don't have no openmindedness

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       and it just seems they're on a team. Exactly, exactly. They just lock on to team Mac. I'm on team Pc. I like android phones. I'm a windows man. Marcel, we've got a windows phone. Whereas whereas if you talk about liberty, you're talking about a philosophy and an idea that, that, that that's, that's what I like to talk about. I like having discussions based on the ideas and philosophies, the underpinnings. Not, not, don't, don't label me Republican, Democrat, even a libertarian. I want to talk about ideas and, and, and develop a philosophy that's that fucking shit works there. Can the conservative Liberal Shit works? Look in works by the way, with liberals just as bad. It's what conservatives are. Nothing drives me fucking nutty. More than hypocritical liberals who talk about Republicans being prejudice and then they're completely prejudice. He lost his mind. Anybody who has any ideas remotely different from there.

Speaker 3:          01:38:50       It's so weird. That whole like artificial sensitivity. You know like you, you've, you've, you've adopted what is like a chic style, a cool style of thinking. You know, this is the, this is aggressive style people. We also, my father was talking about tyranny of language. There's a tyranny of language in this country where, where one side will garner a sort of a patent on. We are the progressive's. We are, well, I haven't, I believe I happen to believe we should legalize gay marriage and drugs and a lot of other things. That makes me pretty progressive, but at the same time I want a small government so that I can be considered a conservative as well because I want, I don't want, I don't want all these vested interests in my flat, but that's the question is how do you, and if I start talking about, if I start, if I start talking about small government people go, you're a republican.

Speaker 3:          01:39:42       Well, no, I'm not actually because I'm pro choice and you know a lot of other things, so don't call me and I'm not a Christian, so let's relax with this stuff. You know? So, so there is a tyranny of language in this country and and there always has been in political, in political culture. You, you, you did a really good book called don't think of an elephant that I ever tell you about this book. No, it's written by David Frum who talks about, I think his name is David Fromm. Forgive me if it's not, but he talks about how, how effective it is when you, when you say this is the Patriot Act, how do you vote against, against the Patriot Act for example, you're not going to vote him. Get Dot. You're not a patriot if you vote against the Patriot Act, and there are a lot of things you can do as a, as a political force to hijack your position by making it very inconvenient and sound bad. When you vote against, you can't vote against the page. How do you change it, Joe? How do you change it? I don't know, I'm still trying to figure it out. Uh, the only thing that I can think is you got to change young people and you've got to have the people that are going into it. Like this guy that we had, David Seaman who was on a Monday, June his twenties, 26 years old. Wow, that's, that's the noise. I'm not congress, the kind of guy and very

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       articulate, very bright. That's the kind of guys you need. You need young kids that are coming out of college and that they understand the way the world works a million times better than some fucking dummy who grew up in the land of books and crayons. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:41:08       Amos Oz is a famous Israeli writer was saying, um, he said the way you will beat, they were talking about Hamas and I'm as a terrorist organization and they said, he said, well I, he had a problem with Israel going in and assassinating Hamas leaders and he said the way you, you, you beat Hamas is not with guns. Cause Hamas is an idea. And they said, what are we doing? He said, the way you beat a bad idea like Hamas is with a better idea, and that's a really powerful statement. It is power come up and remember that this country, this country is an idea. This eye is an ideal. And, and in a lot of ways those men in those founding fathers solve the political problem. The constitution is an amazing thing and it's being jacked less than a reject, but remember that it's a very powerful idea and keep fighting for it.

Speaker 1:          01:41:50       Obama has done more to harm the constitution than any president before him. What he's done by pass the National Defense Authorization Act is nothing short of what you should have considered as treasonous w w w with someone in the past we consider as treasonous the ability to detain people with no warrant to the ability to hold them with no recourse whatsoever. They don't have the right to a trial. They don't have anything that we're supposed to be standing for it. America for foreign enemies. Oh No, no, no, no, no, no. It's for anyone that they deem to be an enemy of the state. Wow. National. We were allowed to use that. He has now rather allowed to use the military to quell any, did any dissent inside our brochure? Yes. Posse comitatus done. He's trying to get through it. Oh, it's past national defense authorization act. Everybody passed it. Obama said he was going to veto. It didn't be taught. No one vetoed it. No one pass it. I don't think they get a say. I really don't. I think when you've got a company like Halliburton and then has fucking billions of dollars and they're, they're profiting in in mad crazy ways from his fucking war. I don't think anybody gets a say. I think that influence the influence of that money is so strong and so sharp. They can't avoid it. I hope you're wrong. I'm not wrong. I'm not wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:43:15       You may not be wrong and and so in that case it's hard not to be sent. How do you not know about this? We talked about this before. I mean reading, reading, reading this, this movie. Just talking about reading this book. I just keep talking to you. Call that called the China study is a classic example. This guy does such an amazing job of off Tang, what you're saying, how we are no longer all of a sudden your kid at school is, is being fed all different kinds of food that is not only making them sick but fat.

Speaker 1:          01:43:41       How did you, but listen man, you can give your kid food. Okay, that's, that's a terrible thing and everything. When your kids phone to school, you can bring a lunch. That's not as bad as what the fuck is happening. The ability to have people arrested with no recourse, man. We are literally literally in a Soviet, did I talk to you about this a while ago? Man, National Defense Authorization Act. It's a terrifying thing that was passed. Terrifying. All this shit that's going on with wikileaks where they're trying to pull this guy out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London. They're, they're letting everybody know that the rules are fake. Like, well, that rule the world. He's actually wanting for sexual assault and Sweden. Sweden's just wanted for sexual assault. Don't say that he's wanted for sexual incident cries sex surprise sex is a bitch. Shut it off.

Speaker 1:          01:44:30       You can't turn on a junkie kind of look up. No, I was trying to look at that act. Oh, surprise sex is what he's wanted for. What do you mean surprise sex? What's that? Nearly had sex with a chick with a condom on and they were sleeping in bed together and with no condom he slipped it in and there's photos of her hanging out with him two days later, like all palling around. Look what he did was kind of creepy, but guess what? You're not supposed to sleep naked with a guy if you don't want him to stick. It was or, and that's just what dudes do were gross rose, creepy animals. Of course he's wanting to dive well, it's not even that. I don't know how many times back when I'm back in the day, I'd be like, well, I don't have any diseases. And what about not just the tip, all the dies? Well that's what he did. He's a scumbag sex gambler, but a lot of guys are, there's a video of him dancing. Scott, myself. Yeah, guy. Just regular guy is a video of him dancing by himself. It's just him on the dance floor getting his groove on and it's so dorky and creepy. You Watch and it's just like, oh Jeez, look at this guy. He's so weird.

Speaker 1:          01:45:30       He's American, isn't the American, how did he, Swedish massage. Yeah. I don't think it's a man or a fucking agent of this information. You work for Fox and I'm just saying, I think, I don't know. Well it's, I want to see positive. He's debates. John O'reilly, Bill O'reilly, and he does such a great job. He fucking made fun of a Fox. I'm such a good way though. He just exposed and I read to a bill O'Reilly. Oh he's Australian. That's a stress. I knew he had something going on. I might as well be American. I was truly in Australia. You do? Yeah. When went to Sydney. They're fucking, they have the, Australia is a, they're like a little more relaxed than us. A little more down to party little, you know, this is fun people and they're just different. I like Australia. I've actually never met an Australian who is a deck. I had two friends that are really famous in Australia and not famous here. Orange Barker who's like Kinda does well here. Eddie, if Eddie F yeah, and both of them are fucking year, especially orange are just gigantic in Australia. Yeah man. He's like fucking Justin Bieber over there. I can't walk down the street in Australia. Yeah, and they love him in Australia, but in America it's like barely hanging on. You know, he comes over here and just fucking half fold crowds and doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 3:          01:46:49       He goes over there, he fills out auditoriums every night. Really? Yeah. He's sold out some crazy shit like 18 nights in a row in a theater there at least it might be more than a million, by the way. 18 nights Australia, I'm coming, it's like two months and offered a couple of times and it's just like, I'm always like, we're going to fly first class. Well we don't have in the budget. I'm like, fuck you. That budget, that's a $25,000 fucking ticket in first class. That's why they put you on one of those 83 eighties and you get like a little apartment. That's what FirstClass says. But if you don't do that then you're stuck in a cramped spot for 16 hours and it sucks. Business class business, cause I flew first class to Thailand and I was doing a hangover too and that was, that was that I got off the plane, I was a year older and I was so fucking long.

Speaker 3:          01:47:36       It took me and I was sitting in first class and it was like luxurious and everything else. I had all tie Taiwanese airline or whatever it was. It was unbelievable, but you know what? Too long and you feel like shit for, you know, they say that the radiation from those planes when you're flying and high altitude, the radiation is way worse than the radiation you're getting when you're going through the metal detector. Air is also shitty too. Shit air and you've got to drink a lot of water. I do that. A lot of the hangover feeling the people get dehydration, drink a lot of water, eat something very nutritious. Alpha brain helps a lot. It's fantastic for jetlag. Yeah. Fantastic for jet lag and fantastic for when you don't get enough sleep because it's one of the, one of the main reasons that you have that sort of like a foggy misfiring sort of a brain when you're hung over or when you're jet lagged.

Speaker 3:          01:48:28       So your neurotransmission, Mike Young said he goes, you and Rogan, I've been with you guys on the road. You guys don't need any sleep on the how you doing? I was like, I need sleep, but if I'm having a good time I can go. I can go. Cause I was in Afghanistan and I, I didn't sleep for probably a week, like, like just very little. I was still working out. I was just so pumped and afraid at the same time. So my adrenaline was just literally pumping for a week, so I didn't even need any say I'd wake up two hours, I'd be like, all right, we got sold out shows and you're going to do a big giant fucking crowd's waiting to see you. You get fired up, man. I don't care if you're tired and you have to, I felt sick with a fever. I got on stage an hour and a half later I come off and I'm like, I'm 100% right.

Speaker 3:          01:49:12       You feel better. Yeah. It's a, no one is ever going to understand that feeling unless they've actually done it. But there's a giant responsibility that you have after a while when people are coming to see you. You remember when you would go to a comedy club and it was just like, you happen to be headlining, but nobody knew who the fuck you and I went out on that stage in front of your fans in Denver. It was so loud at her. My face feel that I could feel the sound waves on my face. That was 2000 ravenous fans, ravenous fans. And the minute I walked out there, they thought it was Joe Rogan. They were on their feet, literally like, like

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       I was like, oh, okay. This is a, this is a whole different level. Yeah. We tell people what we're talking about. We, uh, we, we pumped the crowd and Brian went on, we said Lazy and Joey Diaz brought me up, but Brian went on stage instead. So it was, it was, uh, I have recorded it actually. Yeah. It was really funny though. It was a, it was hilarious because it like, they went on for a little while, but then they were like, Hey, wait, what the fuck is going on here?

Speaker 3:          01:50:14       Hold on, let me see if I go find it. You guys, don't forget about the 10 minute podcast. We're number 15. You're number 15 now. Yeah. 10 minute podcasts number. I think [inaudible] 15 and [inaudible] last time I checked I was number 14. Oh, you said that was mine. That was mine yesterday. So it's pretty exciting. Are you excited? I love it. Yeah. This is you ready?

Speaker 5:          01:50:37       Brian's going to go out there. Ask me. You see how long it takes for the realize to not me? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:50:43       Just come walking out and this is Joey d is about to bring me on what's going on? Gonna fucking Frank's since what? I said, they still think I'm you crazy or you mean only people in the front row where I'm like, what the fuck's going on? They were like, we lose a lot of weight. Does Joe have rickets? There's still, see he's still on stage. And now I got onstage and then I was like, okay.

Speaker 1:          01:51:31       Right. So your fans are great too. They were literally all they, they all, I couldn't get out of the foyer. You hadn't seen it before. And I told her, I remember telling you, I'm like, wait till joy get Joey Diaz goes on stage. I go, you're going to see something that you've never seen before. And I remember the look on your face. You were like, Holy Shit, this is crazy. It's, it's a, it's on. Uh, it's on a completely different level when you see, did you ever think, why do you think you're a podcast is so insanely,

Speaker 1:          01:52:00       I dunno, um, people are connecting with it. What are they connected with? I am being as honest as humanly possible and uh, I have, uh, I got a lot of interests. I'm fascinated by things. And I think people get to be fascinated and along with me on this podcast and they know that if I'm telling you something, whether I'm right or wrong, it's because I truly honestly believe it. Cause I looked at it, I studied it. Even if it doesn't make any sense, like, yeah, like big foot, like big foot talk, I'm, I'm not willing to say the big foot's not real. Yeah. You know, and that's for a lot of people, like as soon as you start saying shit like that, you become an idiot. You know, students, you, as soon as you start saying things like, you know, you think maybe there might be a intelligent life that's visited this planet thousands of years ago and made people

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       out of monkeys, like, get the fuck Outta here. Yeah. I don't know. You don't know. You're really, don't just fact it. People exist alone is bizarre enough to me to, to leave open a billion different possibilities for how life is seated throughout the universe, including life on. But I'm not afraid of looking like a retard, you know? I'm just, I think it's good. I think, yeah, I think that's one of the reasons that I also think that I'm really impressed with. I think a lot of people, young man especially want to learn something. Well, a lot of young men are demonized and we've got a real parking problem in this country where we're suppressing masculinity. We're not accepting the fact that men like manly shit. We hundred percent like VHS. We like steaks. We'd like Leonard Skinner was like hunting and fishing and MMA. And guess what you being prejudice about that is just as bad as a man being sexist.

Speaker 3:          01:53:37       It's just as bad as a person being racist. It's you're judging and making people, you know, many times I've felt bad for what I look like or who I am or what I like. When I was a young man, especially women, intellectuals, always different people would like look down on you as if there was something wrong with you, that you legitimately enjoyed what you enjoy without hurting anybody. I always felt inappropriate and it's still a lot of circles while come and I go, man, I think in such a different way than these fucking people. And I, I dunno. It's just, I always, you feel like you're like, you feel like you're doing something wrong when you're younger you're like, yeah, I just like rolling around in a matter. I like, you know, well we're not represented. We're not represented because men, when they reach a certain point in time, they have to put on a fucking tie and some stupid shoes would slippery bottoms and go to some job.

Speaker 3:          01:54:19       That sucks. That's the majority of men. And so they're not really represented. You know, when a guy gets buck wild and lives like Mike Tyson, he's not celebrated. Oh that's good. He's got a crash. Well it's interesting because people want to send to you right away cause I think you're a threat. I that that's almost like there was a psychiatrist talking about male female dynamics a lot of times and a lot of women will be really attracted to an Alpha male. And then what happens is, and it's very, very common and it's a big problem in a relationship. What they'll do is, and this guy's a couple's counselor who works with a lot of different couples, say what they'll do is women will then be afraid that that aggression is going to be turned on them and their children. So they'll, they'll, they'll take it out of the man when they finally take it out of the man of man.

Speaker 3:          01:54:58       Cause I was like, fuck this. I don't want to deal with all of these things are not attracted to him. And I talked to him anymore. Yeah, it's a, it's a grand game. So the point is don't lose sight of who you are and what you're trying to do. There's, there's a great deal to learn and accomplish by embracing your masculinity. You learn just as much trying to get your black belt in Jujitsu as you do. Getting a phd in, in certain ways about yourself. I'm talking about you learn more, you learn more. Listen, it's all relative. But what's important in this life is embrace what you enjoy. And most men are not taught that. Most are most men or they're made to feel terrible about liking certain things. And it's taught by the way, it's just as masculine and play the flute. If you play it really well and no, but, but

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       I mean, you know, he's not there. There are different, there are different forms of and expressions of masculinity. It's not, doesn't even have to be hitting the bag and shit, you know? Well, I just think he, not even masculinity, that's not even the word. It's really honesty because I get a lot of positive messages from women. It's like you're allowed to be yourself. Women should be in the group. Like my wife's in all kinds of girly shit. I don't even try to understand it. I don't understand. I don't pretend, but I don't judge her. I mean, she's well, but she's, she genuinely likes it. There's people who genuinely like country music, they genuinely like it. They love it, they want to hear it. There's nothing wrong with that man. And the problem with a lot of people and a lot of liberals especially, is that they will mock what you love if you don't like what they like.

Speaker 1:          01:56:26       They will try to marginalize your opinion, you know? And you know, they'll talk about calling you hyper masculine that that's really interesting why they marginalize your opinion and they marginalize you and they do it through criticism. And sometimes it can be effective criticism, big, very kind of glossy criticism where they're using big words and, and they're, they're comparing you to something and you don't really have necessarily the ammunition to fight back because you're not as good with language. And all of a sudden you feel kind of without ammo might not even be that. It might be that you haven't even thought about it. And they've been working on this argument against who you are as a human being or most of their life because you are the type of person who's always rejected them. You're the type of person that didn't think they were sexually attractive.

Speaker 1:          01:57:08       So it made them feel bad. So now they've decided that these hype, hyper masculine men who are not attracted to me or assholes ruining this earth. Meanwhile, if that guy thought you were sexy and you know he liked to fuck you and you would like to fuck him and you were into like this hyper masculine guy sticking his big cock inside of you, then it went out, you'd have a different thing. It's like, well we think differently, but as long as you respect my space, I'll suck his cock. But no, he doesn't want to fuck you. So he's an enemy because he gives to you a bad feeling of feeling of you not being attractive, a feeling of you being rejected. It's the same thing with ugly men who become woman haters their whole life. They've been rejected by women over and over and over again.

Speaker 1:          01:57:50       So they develop this, fuck these bitches, fuck these hoes. They have this, this attitude towards women fucking lesbian, that fucking that. That attitude is not much different than the really homely, ultra, you know, aggressive feminist woman who wants to attack everything that men are into. Hypermasculine rape supporters, rape culture. It's really a lot of the same thing. It's finding someone who's different than you and conveniently putting them in a box. So that anything that they enjoy, whether you enjoy it or not, anything that they enjoy becomes fodder and anything that they enjoy, it becomes something that does, that you can use to dismiss. That kind of criticism becomes habitual and it makes it impossible to actually achieve anything in yourself. When you, when you walk around and like such a good critic and you're a good critic, that same could, it comes back to criticize you when you really try try to do something, but you have to be able to look at yourself and your own nonsense

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       and you also have to be able to look at how other people are going to view your own nonsense. And just because you don't like something doesn't mean something is bad, you know, it just means it's not for you and do, you can't marginalize someone based on what they like and what they don't like. There's some brilliant people that like fucking pop music, they are brilliant, but they like to get in their car and listen as stupid ass fucking songs and sing along. It's fun for them and it doesn't make them less of a human. That's right. We've got a real fucking problem in this country of looking for fault in other folks instead of first doing our own goddamn personal inventory first, get that shit out of the way. First, concentrate on all your own issues because a lot of times the issues that you have and other people really are a reflection of how you view yourself when you're around them.

Speaker 3:          01:59:28       Let me piggy back what you just said. Cause a lot of times if somebody said, um, we live in a culture doesn't make you feel good about yourself and, and one of the things that um, that this culture also does advertising things, whatever it might be, but we live in a culture that at that gets you to think that there's something you have to add, you have to add to yourself when in fact it's probably something you'd have to delete. You have to take something away from yourself that doesn't, isn't really you and just get back to who you really are. It's a kind of a neat way of looking at kind of development and growth. I a lot of times I really think that stand up and all the things I do are just bringing me, bringing me back to who I've always been in a way.

Speaker 3:          02:00:03       Like it's a process of sort of, um, uh, distilling. Like I, what I love about writing and stand up is that as I do it, I started to realize in some ways I've always been writing about the same thing over and over again. But in a way I'm distilling who I really am. I'm getting to the core essence of who I really am. So now what I do, it's really, you know, at 45 now what I'm able to do is just sit and let things come to me a little bit more. I don't have to reach as much or, or I can just be and trust what's inside of me to do the job well. You also get to a point where you stop trying to be someone else. That's huge. That's so huge. It takes a while, man. And be easy on yourself. You know, don't be easy on yourself.

Speaker 3:          02:00:49       Why? What I mean by that is don't, don't be too critical of yourself. Just know it's a process. It's a process. It's going to keep doing it. Don't listen when it, it's going to be painful. It's fuck. Be Very critical of yourself or you're not going to get anywhere. It's like you're going to be honest with yourself. You want I us, you and I were never critical of each other. We were, we were honest with each other. Remember, very important all the way, and we still are. We were, we would call each other and we're like, we have conversations where we're not critical cause we love each other. We're like, hey dude, let me bring your attention to something. You may not be seen, but you know what? In both of our credit, you, whatever you've done it to me whenever I've done a deal, you're, oh, you're always like, Yep, you're right. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. I love it. When you do that are important. It's huge. Let you look. I welcome that, man. That's when you know, you have a real friend. When someone you calls and says, hey dude, you can do better and this is why. Or you know, you're not living up to the dude at first. You

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       don't. You don't want to hear it and maybe it will bug you for a couple of days. It's beautiful. Learn to learn to love that shit. Don't take criticism from somebody who does know what they're doing and don't fucking just take blind cords and or, or, or people who want to humiliate you or get better and be better than you with their stupid words. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about somebody who can, who's on your side, who wants to give you constructive criticism. Embrace that Shit, man. Embrace it. Yeah. It's just hard to find likeminded folks. It's hard to find people that also have their shit together or want to get their shit together. It's hard to find people who are also like on the right track and not trying to sabotage themselves all the time. But I said before, sometimes you might have to change your gang magic changes people you work run with.

Speaker 1:          02:02:21       Well. That's why when you and I first met, I would get, I would get mad at these fucking idiots you were hanging out with and there was a difference between you and I say you would suffer all these fools and I would come along, especially when I was young, when I was, I mean we met when we were in our 20s I was a savage. You were a ball, were a ball of hate and energy. I just wasn't into no one's nonsense if you are trying to loose nonsense on me. Nope. Sorry Dude. And you'd see it like this guy's a problem. It's goes is nonsense. Just talking nonsense. He wants too much tension. You're going to hang out with him cause I'm getting Outta here and that's the only way to live. You were so good at removing yourself from any kind of suppressive energy.

Speaker 1:          02:02:57       Dude. You had guys around you that were straight conmen. It was really unfortunate to see imposters yeah, I would be around you and you would bring these guys over like a party at your house or something like that. Yeah. Cause I have to look at cost manning. It was fun. Look at this male hustler he has hanging out at his house. Like this guy could be doing anything. You'll be a fake psychic Kiki's fucking completely full of shit. He's just decided that this is going to be his thing, man. It's La La so far that she's so full of broken people who does that? Who said, who said somebody took the continental United States, turn it on its side and everything. Loose role to California. Well, you think about what California is. It's two things that are weird about it. One, it's people that weren't satisfied with the east coast.

Speaker 1:          02:03:41       Everybody landed on the east coast and then here to reinvent themselves. They can't, they kept going. They were willing to cross the fucking rocky mountains. So just that the beginning is just crazy. The fact that anybody knew that it was anything cool over here. It's crazy to begin with that, you know, the 20s they started doing. I might just send a letter though, man. I can, I'll take it. I don't want it anymore. I want some rain. I think, uh, I like the winter here the best because the winter, it rains all the time. It rains like once a week. And that's what we fucking need, man. It's not natural to be living in a place where it doesn't rain. And, and when you really realize that it's when there's fires. I mean, there's all these fucking brush fires in California every, every couple of years or so. There's a brush fire. Well, you're not talking about moving to Colorado. Dude, I'm down. But Colorado just had massive fires as well. We had a big plot of land and built some fucking credit. Credit village, grow our own food, have pigs, we can shoot from a chopper. That's very important. Well, the pig's really could get

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       out of hand when they're feral. We've got to have a gym, Jujitsu Gym. Yes. Rifle ranch, my pip podcast. The tomorrow or the next day, I'm going to be interviewing Nate, Mark Court, uh, Strikeforce champion. I'm looking forward to that in Colorado. Yeah, no, I'll be in Vegas this weekend at the Paris. Ladies and gentlemen. What's he's doing standing on and is he training in Vegas? Uh, he's, he's a coach on the ultimate fighter. He is. So I'm going to go in there and meet the guys. Oh, he's one of the assistant coaches the country. Yeah, I think so. Shane car when of course. Right? Yeah. Oh, that makes sense. Yeah. Colin and big country are eventually gonna fight. Colin's got 'em man, the poor guys had a lot of bad luck. He just keeps getting these operations. I was getting injured. He had yeah, back operation is how to get his nose reconstructed and then he broke it in the next fight.

Speaker 3:          02:05:28       Fucked it up again. It's such a hard job and that's what kills me about a lot of these guys don't make enough money and they know it's tough. Need to. What, what is, um, uh, who do you think is the toughest heavyweight in the world? Is a junior. Junior is the champ and the, until anybody beats junior, you look at what junior did to Cain Velasquez, we'll get junior did to frank mir juniors, a bad motherfucker. He's, he's, he's a better boxer and a really good boxer. He's really hard to take down and he's a really good MMA boxer. And the difference between MMA, boxing and boxing with big gloves is that you can't, you can't protect yourself the same way with just like a high guard and blocking things cause the gloves are small and they can slip through openings and catch her chin or catch her temple.

Speaker 3:          02:06:09       Whereas like you have the big gloves on and you could pick off a lot more shots and also an MMA boxing of course you have to realize it with the smaller gloves they can, they can, they can hit you and do more damage as well. There's less padding on the glove so you can't take a shot that you might be able to take with a, a bigger glove margin for error is way slimmer. You make one mistake and get clipped. Right. You're done. So Juniors, the best MMA boxer, you know, he's the best at MMA boxing where it's like, you know, Bladimir Klitschko would probably fuck him up. It's regular boxer. It's a different style. And also, you know, dealing with his, his footwork is unbelievable. Oh yeah. And that guy is always moving and hitting the sand. You think you won that fight? Um, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          02:06:53       I watched it and I lost it. I can't make that call. I think that at the end of the day, what's his name was the champion. You've got to take the belt away from the chant. They sent designation decisively taken away. You know, he mean Frankie lost to him before that do close fight. He's the toughest small man on the planet. And I think that, uh, I mean Ben hadn't been Henderson's since a lot bigger than he is physically, you know. Um, but, but that's par for the course for Frankie Edgar. So I, I don't know, man. I don't know enough about fighting honestly to be able to say, I don't know. He's going to go to one 45 now, apparently. But Frankie is, he's got all that to contend with. Then that scares me. Oh, hold on. All those

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       scary as fuck. I don't know what you do with those leg kicks. It should be. And his knees to his knees. He knocked Chad Mendez. I would have named. He's a, he's a fucking bad money cars. Everyone in these weight class, it's like the 55 45 and the 70 they're just killers man for that matter. 85 yeah. Well that's what the, the whole sport is now. What it's getting to be now is like all these guys who have no weaknesses, they have great take down the fence. They have great stand up. They have great, I mean all those worldclass in Jujitsu, that's, that's a word that gets tossed around a lot. He's world class. He's a very high, he, I think he be called Cabrina. He's beaten like really big name Jujitsu guys in straight Jujitsu competitions and his, his fucking standup game. This was everybody's scared of, I mean it's, it's amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:08:22       Like when he got Mike Brown, he got Mike Brown. When he won the title, he got Mike Brown on the, on the ground and got us back in a heartbeat and just battered him from that position. But the way he got his back, I was like, that is some high level shit. Mike Brown is good. Mike Brown is Mike Brown is also still a strong shit that was telling me and I know Mike, you know, and Mike came out to my stand up actually in West Palm beach is great. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. And, and Mike, Mike, I've talked to guys who've rolled with might, they go, he's gorilla strong dude. He goes, when you get on you, you're not getting off. You're not, you're not moving. That guy is just a gorilla. He's strong as fuck. And although took his back like, like a ghost. Yeah. Although he told me about that fight.

Speaker 1:          02:09:03       It goes, he said his hips were just so good cause I tried to do shit in his hips were like fucking, you know. Well the thing there were, um, a lot of people are concentrating on his soccer players that there's uh, another facet of a, of, of like everyone has always said, well wrestlers, it's supportive. You know, wrestlers is a great base. And you know, some people's like kickboxing, that's a great base. But lately soccer players, a lot of people are looking at soccer players that eventually get into Jujitsu. And kickboxing because they have so much better movement. Their movement like forward and backward, they're there. Their whole game is about jumping through the air and running across a field and dodging to the left and dodging to the right and kicking a ball before anybody else can kick it. By the way, they also learn how to kick because if you've ever tried, try some time, get her d one soccer player, try to stop that ball and watch how fast it comes from.

Speaker 1:          02:09:53       It's crazy and they know how to place it, so they developed this leg dexterity. That's why although has that wicked leg kick, his leg kick is so powerful, man. He just whips it around and slams that fucking shin bone in your legs. Your I favor about that. He was like, I thought I was going to faint when he kicked me, so I thought I was going to literally faint. He said it was crazy. Yeah, that's a, that's another new sort of a an entry point into MMA. It was professional level soccer players, which although was although was like ready to go professional, but there's that good. Seems like MMA is more and more gravitating toward those that can be that our master strikers, because in a way, you've got two really good wrestlers, they can kind of cancel each other out after awhile. Like all the more you wrestled in MMA, it, it doesn't necessarily pay off the way.

Speaker 1:          02:10:45       Spending time, being an excellent striker, understanding angles and all that speed and all that seems to be, because you can end the fight so quickly. Yeah. But you also have to have ticked on defense. Yeah. You have to have, if you don't have to take down defense, the striking doesn't mean anything. But it seems like if you have two really good NCAA wrestlers or Olympic rusks, they're gonna, they're gonna, it's gonna be hard to take either one of them down. So that's why they're going to stand up now and see how well, you know, a lot of the wrestlers they develop, develop, uh, you know, in St punching power too because they learn how to throw themselves into a punch to where they would throw themselves into power double, you know, like look at Dan Henderson like Dan Henderson who was more of a Greco wrestler or King Mo King Mo is a good example how a motherfucker can punch and one of the reasons why I could punch, cause he knows how to throw his body into things.

Speaker 1:          02:11:29       Yeah. You know, he's used to like putting the, some serious horsepower into his double legs and he puts that into his right hand. Now I'm Bob drops that shit on. That's why when you see guys like John Jones and Anderson and how they separate themselves and GSP, there are really extraordinary people. There's just something about him. First of all, John's very physically gifted. Yeah. The distance of his limbs. How tall is he? Six. Three. But his limbs are, he's got longer arms, maybe six, four, but he's got longer arms than semi Schulte. Who's a heavyweight. It was the k one heavyweight, uh, Grand Prix, multiple time champion because no one could get in on semi semi. His arms and legs are so long that everybody got fucked up trying to get you on me, including guys like Badr Hari. And he dropped them with like front kicks to the body and shit is semi seven feet tall.

Speaker 1:          02:12:16       Well John has longer arms than him and he's six foot four. Wow. He's got a crazy Lao arms and legs and the reach, when we measure reach in MMA, we only measure from the shoulder to the hands, you know, to like the fingertips, like how far you can touch. But that's not real reach for him. And maybe because you got to factor in the legs and John's legs are so fucking long, he can kick you from a place where you can't even touch it. I want to watch him fight shogun and he looked like it just in a dick completely different weight class. I've got different human being and by the way, he's only been striking for four years. Shogun is, you know, a long time and I may champions is crazy gifted, very gifted. He's a super athlete. He's just one of those guys that he's like, and it's the perfect storm of being a smart guy.

Speaker 1:          02:13:01       Being a guy, works hard, who has good coaching and is a great athlete. All of them together and with, with crazy physical attributes. You know, John, every time you see him is better. You know, you've seen him six months later, he's way better fighter than he was six months. I said, loves what he does. It seems like he's just so enthusiastic. And if that's the truth, he should have taken the Chelsea on and fight next weekend. He passed on that fight on eight days notice, which I, I thought I could see his point of view, but I would've if I was in his corner, I want to say that you eat this, you're going to beat this guy. Like this is a guy who's coming up from 85 you're a way better fighter than him and you gotta make it look like a hero that you, you, you accepted this fight on short notice.

Speaker 1:          02:13:38       And you get to silence Chael Sonnen Moods. He's talking a lot of shit about you. They just shut them down, beat his ass and that's all done. You know, it's uh, and it's an opportunity to make some money, but he didn't, he felt like it was too big of a change to, to change up with eight days. And it could've been also that chail had been taunting him and so he didn't, you know, didn't want to like, um, also also there's, if, if it's also, if you lose is if you win a big deal, you know, he was supposed to, if he loses, it's a big deal. Yeah. But if he wins, it's still big. You just still establishes himself as a bad motherfucker and a scary dude. This is what he is, you know, the way he shut down rampaged the way he shut down were shod.

Speaker 1:          02:14:15       The, we choked out. Machida. I mean, I just don't see that Chels son and being able to deal with that skillset, I think chill. If you had a full camp and really got a chance to really bulk up to two oh five for legit where he's, you know, then it would be a different story that you know, and I may, I may though, I'm just saying that anything can happen in this sport, right? So as a fighter you're aware of that, you know and you have to contend with that directly and and emotionally and all those rematch clause. So you have a rematch clause so chill submits them or something like that. It's got a rematch clause and the rematch is even bigger. It'd be fucking gigantic. I also think maybe maybe that card in UFC seems to be very aggressive about putting on a lot more events than they used to and maybe they could, maybe they could scale it back a little bit and I don't think they can.

Speaker 1:          02:15:01       I think with fuel TV, with responsibility for Fx, yeah there's more demand. There's is there though or is there, is there more demand or is there just more obligation because of their contracts? That's that's good point. Good point. But there is more, there's not just obligations because of the contract is obligations for the amount of fighters that are under contract for the UFC that you have to keep working. You can't have a guy on the contract and not having worked, but once a year, fuck, how's he going to survive? Fighters have to fight at least two, three times a year. I mean, and you don't, you can't do that unless you put it on a lot of events. The UFC has more than 250 fighters under contract, and I think it's more than that. And that's a lot. That's a big responsibility. People knocked in a white and stuff like that, but that's a big responsibility.

Speaker 1:          02:15:46       He has to all those fighters and now the WEC doesn't exist anymore. So because the WEC doesn't exist anymore, now we have all the 30 fives. All the 45 to 50 fives had already been assimilated a while back. Why not? Because they couldn't stay in business. The WEC. No, they just figured it didn't make any sense to keep the two of them together. When you have guys like, uh, like Donald Serone, you have guys like Benson Henderson, he's great fighters that were fighting the WEC. Now look pencillins since the UFC champion now, I mean obviously there's guys weren't getting a shot at the top. Can you see what Penson did when he got there? He Won. Won The whole thing. So the Benson being the WEC champion and now and now being the UFC champion really lends credence to the fact that, you know, it was a good move to bring those guys in to incorporate them in those other, it's actually, there's some really good fighters over there.

Speaker 1:          02:16:34       Mike Chandler, it's really good. He's the lightweight fighter. He's a, he beat any Alvarez. There's also really fucking good. Those two guys are both world class and uh, and then there's, um, what are you expecting more from the 85 or about Torah came over. Yeah. Yeah. Hector Lombard. He was, apparently he was hurt. Apparently he had a cracked sternum. Oh Wow. Yeah. And he fought anyway. He just, he just didn't have anything about that. So we had, it wasn't much he could do. Yeah. Apparently he just didn't have anything in the gas tank. I'll tell you what though. His fucking takedowns or ridiculous and his take down defense was ridiculous and they say it's five 10 he's five eight he's five eight and down in American top team I made a good study and hand ball of hard rope. I've never seen anything like it. He's, he says he's as much easy.

Speaker 1:          02:17:19       He's an extreme mesomorph that's what he is like. He's this thick and strong. I looked at his legs at American top team who's just training and I just looked at his legs and I was like, he, I mean Tiago others is my boy. He's a thick guy. He walks around at about two oh five and he's about five eight okay. Lombard is a lot bigger than he is. Lumbars so ridiculous. His judo skills are so sick that it's take down the fence or ridiculous. Tim Boetsch grabbed a hold and he's like, nope, I'm in. Bosch is a big guy coming down from two oh five, he's a big one 80 fiver. And you know the, when, when, when lumbar wanted to take him down, he took him down, grabbed him, clamped his arms together, up in the air, boom. It's like, but he just didn't do enough, didn't do enough in lots of decision, but he's still a scary fuck.

Speaker 1:          02:18:08       And I think, uh, his next fight he's going to open up a can on somebody's Anderson's next fight is who knows? There's a, he actually offered to step in and fight before he knew the card was canceled. He heard that they were without a main event. He said he's not an 85 pound shape, but he can make two oh five. So he said, I'll fight any two or five pounder. And he wasn't even in shape, like fighting, fighting shit and talking about fighting him. John Jones, no, he wouldn't have fight Jon Jones because he said he wasn't in shape to fight that guy. But he said, I'll fight any other two oh five pounder. So if they could get an opponent for him, some one 85 you know, some two or five pounder wants to step up, fight Machida, they're out of the same house. They won't find Machida, but there's a lot of other guys at two Oh five they could've put if, if he had called up just to probably a couple of days before they probably would have done that, but they were scrambling for him that we had.

Speaker 1:          02:18:56       That would be interesting. We haven't seen Anderson. Yeah, anybody at two Oh five for sure. There's a lot of good fights at to Forrest Griffin and what he did to a lot of tools. I would like to see him against like Glover Glover to share. Glover is a the scariest for Jon Jones at two Oh five and nobody even knows who Glover is. Glover's on monster. Really? Oh, he's a monster. Yeah, he's scary. He's big. He's about to 30 it cuts down to two oh five but he doesn't have any weaknesses. He's punching power is ridiculous. It's got an iron chin. He's a black belt in. Apparently he was training with Leo Machida and rag doll in them. That's the word. Yeah, but it's a question also of his standup is not, it's not just about punching power, it's about angles and folk lover is a killer. He is the one guy that is worldclass that wasn't in the UFC until really recently because he had a visa problem.

Speaker 1:          02:19:45       He couldn't fight in America six years from Brazil and he finally got a fight in the UFC and fuck Kyle Kingsbury and just blew them out of the water. I mean it was, it was scary fight to watch, but he's beaten a lot of high level guys. He was the first guy to beat Soca. Julie Knox. So could you out? He's, he's beating the fuck out of a lot of guys. You fucked up. Marvin Eastman in Brazil. He's a beast man. He's a scary, scary dude. That fight is a fight that shogun turned down show that they offered shogun Glover to share and he said didn't think it made any sense to them. It's like this guy's like world class and nobody knows who he is and Shogun didn't want to find them. Shogun one up fighting Brandon Vera instead, you know, which was a great fight. What a fucking crazy fight that was.

Speaker 1:          02:20:25       Hold on that incident. Oh shogun did. But he had some tough times. It was Brandon. Brandon put up a great fight. Brandon was there. I think he was at the, uh, I think he's taking pictures of people. I think he was at the good looking kid. Yeah, big guy. He was there. Yeah, he was at the Denver. He's really a nice guy taking pictures. He's a great guy. He's a Greg. He got a bad rap for a while. He's a great dude. I love Brandon. But that was a credible, incredible fight. But it's interesting that shogun was like, you know, one of those Glover to share a guy. Fuck that. So you need to set up that fight. That's like, that's a fight where people need to know who Glover is first. Cause this is like gotta be worth a lot of money. This is a risky ass fight.

Speaker 1:          02:21:00       Glover is like the most unknown guy at two oh five that's, that's super top level and scary. I would love to see him versus Jon Jones. I think that be very interesting cause Glover's is really seasoned. Stryker really seasoned and tough as fucking nails, but he's got to do it soon. I think he's 32 now. You know John is John's fucking sky. You got, you got to handle it at 41 right? He's fucked up though. His knees torn up now. It's going to, it's going to be a while for him before he heals up. I've talked to other wrestlers about Henderson. They say there's, there's wrestling strong and then there's Dan Henderson strong. Oh, he's an animal. They say it's the strongest guy in the planet. Well, his massage guy that used to work on him said he's never massage degree. He said he's made out of wood.

Speaker 1:          02:21:40       So there's never a massage like that. A dentist, you know his massage therapist now and she said the same thing. She said she looks, she goes, what did it, I think she said to his father, he goes, what do you, what did you feed him? He goes, I didn't feed him. Just gave him a gun and talking about, I'm on his own phone. There it is. Yeah. He's always like, why don't we eat and the stakes. I want to know I'm hungry. Yeah, we will. The podcast is two hours and 22 minutes old. We just do a little more podcasting and then we'll cut it loose. What? I'm getting hungry. You're going to go to Alaska. You gotta come on. Come on with you. 100% how can I say no to that? You can't say no. I'm supposed to shoot out a TV show my TV show my, I'll find my opening and I'm coming. It's five days. Yeah. You gotta go? Yeah. Fuck. Whatever. It's stupid TV show. It is. I'll come and see. Do you still doing that? Death Valley thing got canceled on a bummer. So fun. So act six people saw it, but I loved it.

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       I was 16 I heard was 1616 people good. Was it good? Was it a good idea? I had one of the best times I've ever had. I played, I played a perverted police chief and it was, and I, they let me just improvise and do my own. It was all like werewolves and, and it was so much fun. You called me up. I remember you told me how it was and I would, I would hold a meeting about our current werewolf or a vampire problem. I just let it happen that we got obsessed with vampires and werewolves Zeitgeisty I know what it is. What is that? There was a theory. I don't know. Well, I think in those kinds of things, a lot of times technology starts moving so quickly and we just, you know, it's all technical and stuff and we just want something.

Speaker 3:          02:23:04       We want resets. We want magic. We wanted, we, I think being afraid though. Well first of all, I think what happened with, with vampires was there really sexy, I mean, Brahms Stoker wrote Dracula in response to the repressive Victorian age. It was essentially a metaphor for how repressive we were on the surface. Yet how perverted we were underneath and along comes as handsome as shit. Guy Who comes in sucks your blood and guess what? You you have an orgasm. That's what those girls were doing. He'd come in hand some shit with a Cape and suck your blood. Suck your neck. Do you remember the Gary and it would be like, oh yeah, the diversity was super sexual. Yes, it was sexual. It always was. It was a response to that repressive Victorian age where everybody was terrified as syphilis and going to hell and at the end of the day they were all fucking each other.

Speaker 3:          02:23:55       They'd be Yang and then dresses up and just rail each as, I shouldn't be doing this. I swear to God. I go to church tomorrow. Well, back then they used to put dresses on legs of tables. They didn't want people being sexually excited by piano lay eggs. They used to dress table legs. I believe. You don't have to. It's a truth. It's not a belief thing. It's fucking craziness. People were nuts. People have always been in a lot of societies, always been obsessed with the sexual problem. That's why men and women everywhere are allowed to work together because no matter what, when you get Pete men and women together, if shit happens the fuck. That's why it's fascinating. I've always been actually most society so that history, I've always been concerned and centered around figuring out a way to to keep that wall up. It's really interesting to anyone.

Speaker 3:          02:24:44       They do it with guilt work. I do it with guilt. They make women feel like slots if they're, if they have sex, they make men feel guilty and a lot of it had to do with, a lot of times you get a bad disease man that you before penicillin and now they got none. They got gonorrhea, a strain gunnery in Japan. That is a antibiotic resistant. Aye Yai, Yai, Yai, Yai. Fucking Japan. Oh, fucking Japan man. Not yet. Wait until the cure. Yeah, exactly. What don't need to come up with another. What is it about today though that the vampires don't have vampire characteristics? It's like I was talking about that movie Bourne legacy. Did you see it? No. It's good fun moving, but there's these is engineered super killer who is constantly saving this hot chick through this movie. Constantly saving her. Yeah, just carrying or jumping and throwing over his shoulder, jumping of fucking Chaz.

Speaker 3:          02:25:33       Him with her never fucks her. And I'm like, what is this nonsense? She is weeping. She's holding onto him vault alone. They're alone in a house. They're sleeping in the same room, sailing a male fantasy. It's the nonsense. You want to save a woman. It's a girl fantasy, but it's the girl fantasy because he doesn't fucker. If it was a male fantasy B double o seven he saves her Vinnie Foxer, but this guy just saves, doesn't know, doesn't even kiss her at the end of the movie after they've been through so much together, they're looking at each other eye to eye and smiling. That's ads. No fucking, she doesn't pose cock couches and starts talking to, what am I doing? I shouldn't do this. I want them to love and respect me, but I was cocky my mouth. Now there's none of that. It's, but that's the same thing with vampires.

Speaker 3:          02:26:16       He's vampires. They can go out in the sun now and they just sparkle. They just want to be with you. They didn't want to kill you like they eat deer blurb like what the fuck man, that was. But that was the whole, the reason twilight was so big, he was an outsider. He was a leper and, and, and you know, he, she could only see him at night. It was Romeo and Juliet. That's what it was. But it wasn't Romeo and Juliet because Romeo was 14 to this motherfucker's a thousand years old. Okay. He, she has a dilemma. He writes several hundred years old. Should I get turned in? Be with them forever. But she's a fucking high school kid. What is wrong with him? He's a creepy cocksucker I'll listen. She was fucking cute. It's all under clinical with that. And he was in high school? No he wasn't. No, he wasn't. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:26:58       was in high school and the 18 hundreds no, he goes taking science class. He didn't, he like is everyone died from like the Spanish flu or something like that. It was lines out, there was like the early 19 hundreds that guy was old as fuck. That's ridiculous. And manual. The, again, it's like top Herrera Dahmer was saying dominoes that we were all hanging out one time long time ago and never these girls there. And Doug goes, those girls good looking. And I go, yeah, they're fucking 21 yeah. And they look pretty good from here. And he goes, no, because at that age, you know, a girl could have a goat head. I wouldn't really give a fuck 21 with a goat head. I'd be like, bad gut check with it. God has got a really nice body. It's fine for me. She's 21 you know. Well, it's funny that the thing comparing the way gay men look at men as compared to the way women look at men and with women, what's important is the guy's eyes smile on his jaw line with men, with gay men, they've gives, Jews don't even have to have heads.

Speaker 3:          02:27:55       They just look at a body. If you could find like a hot guy who was headless, just stuck his fucking hairy ass up in the air. Guys would just be stroke and had to be like, Yay. My Buddy, my buddy, Kate's got a boyfriend, his name is Stan and he wears his hair. Everyone I did I tell you this wrong. No, he didn't. Filipinos really good look and he's got this bubble ass and big tits and spoons heads. Yeah, just, he does a lot of bench, you know, he's like, oh, he's got a full mouth. And my buddy Keith is really my buddy Keith, really macho and he makes millions of dollars in a week. He was like staring at him one time when he was like, look at him and then I'll fucking beautiful this. And I go, I was like, oh yeah. And he goes, you know my, I put up with all this bullshit.

Speaker 3:          02:28:30       I go, why? He goes, look at that. And I was like, but I get it. I was like, you're not even, you're not really even gay. You're just a dude who fox guys, I'm not even sure that's like, you're just so hyper mail that you got to, you know. Oh, that's still, he's gay guys are just guys, the guys sitting here. Listen guy. All right guys smile. A lot of guys are into the Asian guys. That's where Asian guys are like cherished. Whereas like Asian guys have a hard time when it comes to white women or white women or like the flight went and saw. I went with some of the cast from the hangover. I went to the fucking lady boy show in Thailand. Let me explain something to you. One day I'd last a day in jail before I was banging the shit. Those fucking dudes. One day I'd last. I'd be like, you know what? You look up. Fuck it. And the butter. The mouth. Boop kids. Well, yes. What if his gun cock? You'd be able to look down. Look Dude, just put a Napkin over or something. They're tiny. Anyway, push. What have you felt your bull as you're fucking him in the ass. Who felt his cock slapping against your butthole? How many drinks?

Speaker 3:          02:29:39       Two drinks. I got to have at least three do know. Otherwise it's gay. She got to tell him, I said, you got to hold onto your cargo. I fucking the slapping me and he look up bro Bro. Gimme some masking tape. I'll tape it right to your belly button and, and don't, don't fucking look me in the eye and we'll go to, well how feminine did they look? There's some of the best looking women I've ever seen in my, so the answer your fucking question. Did they show their car? Cause like what does it show? They know they tape them down. It's lady boys and let them have had the operation already. So then what are they then look Brody Stevens, ask him, he was being liquor at his face was being stroked and I looked at Brody, I go, listen broadly, if you, if you take that girl slash guy home and fuck her tonight, you're not gay and I'll defend you to the fucking day you die.

Speaker 3:          02:30:23       Cause that's one of the best looking chicks I've ever seen in my life. And he was like, no, I care. But she wears, look at it. I can't do that. But they were fucking beautiful. I a couple of months like, that's a girl. There's no way that's a guy. It's impossible at that a guy. And they were like, that's a guy. Go, we had one on the man show that was so pretty that uh, we were hanging out at the comedy store and she was pulling up or he, whatever you want to call her, was pulling up in a car in Eddie Bravo was like, whoa, check out this chick. That girl's so pretty. I go, dude, that's a guy. I was in Cheetahs. I was a cheetahs in Vegas. Okay. And that's a big strip club. And I, there was a girl there with the cowboy hat who had a line of men trying to bring her into the room to have a dance.

Speaker 3:          02:31:11       The reason I knew that that was a guy was because on mad TV, one of our makeup women, what used to be a guy and, and she was friends with this, this person would become a woman. So I knew that that was a transsexual and she was also, she was Vietnamese. She was fucking gorgeous. Then she later got married to a very wealthy, um, well I think I can say it, I don't want to say it, but he, he was a very, very well known rocker. I'm a guitarist and a rockstar. Oh, rockstar. But he was a very, well, he made a lot of money in a band, very popular band. And he married, he married her and which only gave me more respect for him. Okay. Who is it? Come on. I was, I don't want to say, cause I actually know, I know, but I don't want, I don't want to, I don't want to say because I don't want, I don't want them to know that this person was stripping. I, there's a lot of shit that goes on with it. You know what I mean? I don't want to,

Speaker 1:          02:32:09       well, this guy, this guy that had become a girl that Eddie Bravo had seen in the car, we had her on the man show and the man show was, uh, the band show and they see that sign behind is it said, make me hard to see that this sign right here, that was the game. The game was making me hard. And what it was was we had an electronic box over a dude's Dick. And we would decide when the light would go off as a red light on it and the light would indicate that he has an erection. So we would have like different things in front of him, like a midget eating a banana, you know, like all these different things that would give him a boner. Yeah, it was a fun Gig. Um, when we, when we did it, we did one of them with a transsexual and she was fucking hot, man.

Speaker 1:          02:32:50       I'm telling you, you would not be able to tell. So she's on this guy's lap. Okay. And the guy's going to woo. They, uh, she's got whipped cream. She puts whip cream on her tits. He sucks. The whipped cream offered tits. Everybody's going fucking crazy. The audience is going Shit House. Then she pulls out her panties and unveils this, this dick that looks like it had been poisoned because she Jameel hormones. So Dick was like black and sick. It was like, it had been like it would've been atrophying was, yeah. Oh yeah, for sure. Not just atrophying. It was like it was completely cut off from the process, like withered away and see now I have a boner. Is that weird black? It was a black Dick and she wasn't black. She was like a Latina something another. Yeah, but her dick was, but the dark, it was tired.

Speaker 1:          02:33:41       It was rotting. It was like it was running away and she pulls it out in front of everybody in front of the crowd and the collective of everyone and the real, the look of repulsion in the guy's eyes. Oh my God. This tied to this chair with this box over his dick with, by the way, the red lights flashing like crazy now cause because we control the red light, it wasn't really when you're in Florida, so the lights, everyone's going, Oh and here's a Dick Right in front of his face and this crazy bitch that he had just sucked. Whipped cream offered tits. Yeah. And now she's got this cock in front of them. Yeah. By the way, they had no problem with that. Comedy central had no problem with that. But they did have a problem with hard. The reason why that sign is here is because we had to use another sign because he couldn't be make me hard cause making me hard was they wanted to make me stiff.

Speaker 1:          02:34:32       Right. That's what they said. That was one of the things they argue. Those are arbitrary things that they, standards and practices guys like decide on Sunday the standards and practices. It's the fucking, it's the network and the advertisers. It's not even that. It's just a bunch of dummies who want to have their say on things. Right. And that's why doing something on the Internet, it's so beautiful. Like if we had one of those same executives in this room and we were talking about things, they would probably tell us not to talk about it, right. They would tell us a change of subject. If someone had a sit down with us and give us like a list of shit that we couldn't take. Personal responsibility. It gives you your own sovereignty and it's what all human beings want and should have. If I don't pee right now, I'm going to die.

Speaker 1:          02:35:07       Don't die. Silver, come to Vegas. Two hours to 45 minutes. Let's wrap this bitch up was bringing this bitch into the, into the harbor checkout.
