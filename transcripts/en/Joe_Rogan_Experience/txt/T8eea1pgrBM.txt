Speaker 1:          00:00:03       How do I pronounce your name? Calling on the war. Colianni. Okay. Yeah. Now there's a conspiracy out there. Okay. I made this name up. We'll talk about that. We're talking about that. We're live already. How'd you do that so quickly? Oh, you're a wizard. What's the conspiracy about your. Your name is on noir. What's the conspiracy about your name? That I made it up to hide who I really was. Oh, type shit. Like I'm like, everybody gets to have pseudonyms except for me when you're talking about guns, you don't get to have pseudonyms. Did you have a different name? Yeah, my name is collins. Oh, okay. So you did change the name? Yeah, I did. But there's a conspiracy behind you changed your name, but that's not real. You just decided you wanted a different name. I got into guns and I wanted to start watching gun videos and so I wanted to make a youtube channel and I didn't want to use my real name because I thought that wasn't cool enough. And so I said your name wasn't cooling to know I didn't want to, uh, African American thing. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, I mean I know comedians had changed their names, like earthquake.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       Earthquake is fucking hilarious. Convenient man. He's hilarious. But a white dude couldn't call them self or earthquake. Hey, good. Nah You could. But nobody would wrestler. That was a restaurant name earthquake. But that's different. That's different. That's a big giant guy. Right. So what's your original name? What's your actual full original name? I'll give you my first name. I'll just, I just don't want to make it easy for people to show the um, Collins Collins and around it. Yeah, it's a fine name. Something wrong with that. What's wrong with it? Why that name bother you to the point where you didn't want to have it on? No, I just thought it'd be more fun to just come up with a pseudonym for my youtube channel. I didn't start my youtube channel thinking, all right, I'm going to start this channel and I'm going to build this whole brand behind that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       No, it was just for fun. Yeah. My friends call me. One of my friends, he called me killer corleone. Right. That was kind of a little nickname that I had. And so I was like, okay, well just use going on and then I'm like, I'm always in black. Why did he call you killer cold? No idea. When I talked to him to this day, I still don't know why he called me that. Yeah, there's nicknames, man. That just happens sometimes there is a rapper and Houston by that name. Killer corleone. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Um, so I don't know if maybe he listened to him and then my name Collins and then called me on and so forth and so on. Yeah. So, so how did you get wrapped up with the NRA? So we should, we should cover a couple of things here. The origin story.

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       Yeah. So you're kind of like a spokesperson for the NRA, not official spokesperson, not official. Unofficial. Today. You are a member of the NRA. Do they recognize you? Do they appreciate you? Like how does that work? Okay. So the way it started, I mean, I'm going to start from the beginning. Okay. Alright. So, um, my had a friend of mine, a good friend of mine who called me up one day and was like, do you want to go shooting? And I was like, because at the time I really wasn't pro gun and this was about, I was around 24, I'm 34, so this is 10 years ago and I hesitate a little bit because my background growing up, like I didn't grow up with guns in the house, um, no one in my family had a gun and for me the idea and the notion of being a young black male with a gun, it's always, I only saw three exactly through the lens of, you know, Gang Banger, drug dealer, so forth and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:03:28       So that's the mindset I had when with respect to firearms, I'm unconsciously, right. I didn't even realize it wasn't even conscious of it until I started getting into this very heavy and realized, okay, wow. I was thinking like that didn't realize it. And so, but at the same time I told myself, why am I afraid of essentially what is an inanimate object? Right. So I think to myself, I'm like, all right, I really don't want to go, I'm a little terrified, but you know what, I'm going to go ahead and do it. And so I remember getting to the range, we get to the range and we walk them through the door and then I hear the door for where the actual bays are and I heard a pop pop, pop go off and I'm like, holy crap, this is actually happening. And so I kind of had this nervousness but I'm with my friend, right?

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       And so I don't want my friend to feel like, okay, you're acting kind of like a bitch. Right. So I kind of kept it to myself. You get to the counter, we do all the paperwork that, you know, represent paperwork, like billy phones all that. Um, and he has his gun, we get to Malmo, we go to the lane, I remember it was the very last lane, it was a, maybe the range was top gun in Houston and so we go to very last range. It gives me kind of like a brief instruction about how to shoot the gun. How to load it, so forth and so on. And so at that point, remember picking up the gun, terrified not knowing what to expect, not knowing what was gonna happen. So I remember picking it up. It was a little tourist ptsd, 11 1:11 millennium in 40 caliber. And this was a subcompact probably not the best first time shooting the fucking gun. Well, the gun itself was small caliber example. Lot of kick you. Exactly. So my experience, anybody who watched that as a gun person would be like, oh, this is not gonna end. Well.

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       So I remember standing at the bay and then taking a gun and pointing it and shooting it. And I remember just the concussive force, the explosion, the gun dancing in my hand. And I was like, holy crap. That was terrifying. They're to shout it again. I was like, I liked this shit. And the weird thing is it not in a way that most people think the nerdy aspect of my brain kicked in, right? I'm like, holy crap. Like I'm taking this project down. I'm launching it right several feet. Um, and I just, the second shot allowed me to realize what just happened. I just contained an explosion in my hand. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       I'm like, if you don't find that amazing, you don't have a pulse. It's amazing. The thing that people are bothered by is what comes with it and how people use it. And I think an analogy that's a fair analogy, but people reject is driving cars and a lot of these fucking psychos that have been running over people in the street. I mean, it just happened again, Perlin somewhere somewhere in Germany. Some guy ran a bunch of people over and then blew his brains out. It's, it's an object, right? It's a thing that you use. And I'm a huge car guy to Sam as well. Yeah. Yeah. I love cars. I mean if someone said we have to ban cars because people started running people over with cars, they'd be like, well, okay, I think we're dealing with a whole bunch of problems. And there's, there's a bunch of things that I think we will probably agree on.

Speaker 2:          00:06:48       One of the things we can agree on is all these mass shootings are horrific. Absolutely. They're terrifying. It's. It's an evil, terrible thing that here's another thing. No NRA members are doing that. That's one of the things that's really kind of fucked up about people getting angry at the NRA. Yeah. We've never had a mass shooting ever that, that I can recall that was done by an NRA member. I looked. I tried to find one. I can't find a mass shooting that was perpetrated by an MRI NRA member and I think it's. So the biggest problem that a lot of gun owners, especially NRA members have, is like the conversation that's being had is basically coloring or actually forgetting the human element behind those three letters. Like the NRA isn't like this demigod that just sits in the cloud of Olympia and it is just one big guy that just orchestrating this entire thing.

Speaker 2:          00:07:40       Yeah. It's, you're talking 5 million people, you know? Right. Like I'm a, I'm, I'm a member, I am a gun owner. Right. That that's who I am along with 5 million other people who were that way and then there were a ton of other people who think they're in our members in art and then a ton of other people who probably don't mind being an Ra members, they just haven't gotten around with doing it and getting the membership and the vast majority of those people. And I'm saying that just to be safe. They're good people. I think there's quite a few good people, um, the people that are perpetrated, all these mass shootings are definitely not good people. But what's wrong with them? Well, I'll tell you what's wrong with them. Guns not guns that are wrong with them. They use the guns to express what's wrong with them.

Speaker 2:          00:08:24       You know, and everybody wants to look at the object, which I get what's easier? Well, it is easier and it's something that everyone's pointing to. Like, why do you need an Ar 15? Why do you need to do this? Why didn't you do that? These are good questions. Why do you need these things? Why do I need that Fucking Samurai sword over there? I don't know, it's like what do you need? And that's another thing too though, and I've said it before, I think we are a victim of our own success in this country, right? I do think this is the greatest country in the world, but the problem with that is is

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       this country was built on an ideological foundation that I think it aids in that our ability to be as great as we are, but we live in a world now where people don't see the necessity for something that was never, that was never supposed to be seen through the lens of necessity in the first place. The Second Amendment doesn't give me a right. It preserves something that already existed, but what happens is we have a culture of people who don't, who look at the second amendment as a privilege, not a right there, look at it as a privilege. So that's why they say, well, why do you need that? Why do you need more than 10 rounds? Why do you need this? Why do you need that? And I'm like, first of all, reframing the entire conversation underneath when that's not what the second amendment is about. It's a right that I've already had. It's a natural right that I had the moment that I stepped foot on this earth as a person. The right to self defense is, is universal.

Speaker 2:          00:09:44       Yeah. And the people say, okay, it's a right, but obviously there's a problem so we have to do something about it. So you're going to have to give up your guns. This is, this is the common conversation and it's very flippant and it's not well thought out and there's no, no consideration whatsoever to mental health issues. I think because I think this is. I think that's the primary problem that's. I've been saying this from the get go. I think it's the primary problem. I think it's a mental health issue and people say, oh, that's simplifying it. I don't think it is. I think it's the opposite. I think it's, it's ignored it. Look, it's there's something wrong when you have this many people on mental health medication. And then when you look at the number of mass shooters, it's almost universal. Almost every single one of them is on some sort of psychiatric medication.

Speaker 2:          00:10:33       But that's not a part of the narrative. That's not a part of the conversation. The conversation is always get rid of guns. Now I don't want crazy people to have guns. I don't think you do either. No, don't. So outside of taking away the rights to have guns from normal law abiding people like yourself and myself, I have guns. What, what do we do? Okay. So first of all, I think we need to frame the conversation and into specifics, right? You're a lawyer, right? I am. Okay. Yeah. So you understand bills and amendments and law. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       And so I think one word lumping the entire conversation in one category, right? If we're going to talk about school shootings, let's talk about school shootings, right? So the first thing I say is, because for one thing, a lot of people in it, so I'd like to say is, well you guys just don't want any

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       gun laws and you say no to everything, but you have no true. But to stand up for that, it's because all they want to do is take away the guns. Yeah. They're saying, let's take away the guns. You're saying we're not going to take away the guns. You guys just don't want to get your guns taken away. Yes, you're right. You're right. No one wants to get their guns take away. And then I get labeled a monster as a result of saying exactly. You want kids to die and it's a fucking real sneaky conversations. Disingenuous. Yes it is. And that's the odd thing about

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       it is it's you see anybody who's paying attention to the discourse in way it's happening. Especially on social media. Right. Anybody who follows my twitter, my twitter account knows this multiple occasions I've tried to have a rational conversation with people who are on the complete opposite side of my spectrum of, of this issue. Is there any of this online or like debates or anything like that? Well, no, I mean it's just on twitter. Tweets going back and forth. Didn't do anything rational. You can occasionally, you got the American people being friendly. You wouldn't see me flustered, respond to me rationally because I'm always, you know, had this right of course, and I actually have to check myself about that a little bit because how am I any better than the people on the other side if I had the same at the same energy that they have towards me.

Speaker 1:          00:12:44       That's a very good point. And so I've started, you know what, let me, because I can be incredibly snarky like I can and it's partly due because of my friends. They're all assholes, just like all the friends I grew up with. I grew up arguing with a group of guys who when they were losing it logically, they went to jokes. Right? And it's like a man pretty much, right? It took me a second to realize it because I was the one in law school, right? I was the one that was going to law school, law, all that stuff. So everything I did was focused and center through the idea of logic, logic, logic. You're not making any sense and you crack a joke and everyone's laughing and I realized there's some power to that. Right. You know, humor, I mean you should know something about that. Just a little for sure. Yeah, and so I took on some of those qualities in the way that I advocate for firearms, you know, because it can be a little disarming, but the disarming aspect of it can be beneficial because it causes people to drop their guard a little bit and then when you drop your guard you can take in information more objectively, more so than waiting or looking for confirmation bias or in instigating your cognitive dissonance because you just don't want to hear the thing that is contrary to what you already believe.

Speaker 2:          00:13:55       I just think you need a lot of character, like as a person to be able to communicate reasonably on twitter and there's a lot of people that are just lacking that. So it's almost like the ability to steal and no one's looking the ability to shit on someone with no ida, eye contact, no social repercussions. No know you're not feeling anything from that person. You say something rude to them. They're not in front of you, so you don't feel terrible saying that.

Speaker 1:          00:14:19       Yeah. No, it's, I'm not gonna lie, so twitter isn't dirty place, it's a dirty place, but it's a great place to. Sometimes it is, it has its benefits, right.

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       There's some really good conversations to be had on twitter and I've had a really interesting moments on twitter where I've learned a lot about things where people have sent me links and I've retweeted them and I've, I've learned a lot of things, but it's hard sometimes, man, because there are so many people that are just unreasonable and they're not good at communicating and they're happy. They're not happy people and does a lot of people out there that just aren't happy man. It's, you know, and it'd be honest with you, I didn't realize it until I got to the notoriety that I am now in the space that I'm in. Well, you're in a weird space because you're in the space of defending guns, you know, and I'm black. Yeah. And I'm relatively young. Yeah. There's a lot going on there. And we were a lawyer and I worked well.

Speaker 2:          00:15:13       They tend to disregard that. Well, they should probably pay attention. Well, it doesn't matter because I have, I'm doing, I'm advocating also with certain three letters behind me. They automatically assume as the devil for now. How does the NRA feel about you? Do you know? I mean, do you have conversations with them? Are they saying good job or they. Are they pleased or as far as I can tell, they are. We still have the relationship we have. It's very much a very symbiotic relationship. It's a weird one right now because it's like, this is what I hear from the NRA. I hear colon and then I hear Ted nugent.

Speaker 2:          00:15:47       Those are the two that I hear it. I gotta be honest. I'm not, I'm not the biggest fan of Ted techniques rhetoric. Um, but I do know where it's coming from. But then again, I didn't grow up listening to Ted nugent. Yeah, that's not my demographic, but at the same time to a new job, it's still an individual and people fail to understand that. Like we, like, we may be monolithic on that, on the issue of firearms. We're not monolithic in the way we go about expressing it. Well, he's right about things. Just because someone's outrageous doesn't mean they're not right. Like if you ever seen his, uh, the, the debate that he had in a gun store with the Piers Morgan. Yeah. No, the funny thing is to do just incredibly bright. It is smart guy. Crazy as hell. I don't even think he's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:16:33       I do. You can only. You can only kill so many things for you. Lose your fucking marbles. Ted Lives on a ranch in Texas where it's all fenced in. He's just shooting all animals. He hunts every day. He's a psycho and I don't, with all due respect, I'm a big fan of strangle hold. So what, so how, what's, where's the line of demarcation between becoming and not hurting enough in terms of becoming a crossing over that line into, into sociopath? Well, I'm just joking. I'm a hunter. I mean it really depends entirely upon what he's doing with the meat. And I know he gives it to hunters for the hungry. I know he gives it to neighbors and friends and there's nothing wrong with that. And he asked. He actually has a, he has an obligation to be the steward of his land because he has a lot of exotic and stuff and I'm just totally joking around. Oh No, I know. But when you, um, when you listen to his conversation with Piers Morgan, which Piers Morgan takes that flip in, left wing knee jerk reactionary, you know, regionally paragons. Yeah, he's a cunt. And when, when he's on with Ted, Ted just knew everything about the actual facts. When you start running around with statistics of gun violence, he's like, do you know how many of those people were bad guys that were shot cops? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       Do you know how many of those people were people that were shot when they were breaking the people's homes? Do you know how many of those people were people that were killed in self defense? There's a lot. Yeah, it's not in the, you know, how many of those people, when you say talking about gun violence, how many of the people were suicide? Uh, yeah, there's a lot. Keep in mind that's recent suicide. Well, no. So here's what happened. So when I started getting really deep into the advocacy component of it, the everyone was screaming, 30,000 people die from gun violence, 30,000 people a day. That's what they were running with. And they were scaring all the suburban House moms. Oh my gosh. We got to do something about gun control. We got to do something about guns. So I, I jumped into the pool and I, I, I just like, something doesn't seem right about that figure right now.

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       I'm not saying I'm is wrong about it. It seemed inflated. It seemed inflated. I don't know what it was. It's on a subconscious level as or maybe, or maybe it was me looking for confirmation bias, right? Because I felt the way I did about farms, I'll be honest and say that. And so what I did is I kind of researched a little more than I realize holy shit, over 65 percent of that 30,000 suicides, 65 percent real. He's just Christ. So what does that like 18,000 people a day shoot themselves, man. Something crazy like that. What do we say at the top of the show? And people are miserable, man. That's a fucking crazy number though, man. That's a Kevin Hart concerts pretty much altogether. Goodnight everybody. Well that's really what it is. 18,000 people. That's fucking incredible. So then it. But then it begs the question that you brought up before the mental health aspect.

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       Yeah. How much? How much? How many lives would we actually save if we took the same energy we applied to just making guns evil and trying to ban guns and take that energy and put it towards understanding what it is. Why as a society we have a society that is so eager to really not want to be here anymore. Hm. Expand that a little bit more. Because we have all the guns in the universe here in America, right? Compared to any other country. But yet our suicide rates should be exceedingly higher than all the other countries that don't have as many guns. But it's not the case. Right. You look at the UK, you look at Japan, Japan has double our suicide rate. Does it really? Oh yeah. Double. Yeah. Wow. So 60,000 people a day in Japan or whatever the fuck per year. Smaller.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       Not Everyday. It's every year. Yeah, per annual. One hundred 23. But I said that you go complaint numbers again. I fucked up. Did I say a day earlier or did I say a year? Earlier. A day? Yeah. Yeah. Because you owe $30,000. What did I say? Day $30,000 a year. Doesn't sound that bad because $300. Million people. Oh yeah. So you would, you would think about it predicated on, on a daily basis? No, no, no, no. Annually. Annually. That doesn't make any sense. Why would I think that? I think he might've said on accident too. Oh really? But everyone. Thirty. Yeah. Thirty thousand pounds in a year from gun violence. Call it gun gun fire. But in reality you break those numbers down, makes contact with San Francisco, 65 percent of those are suicides in about five percent of those are, um, are God dammit. I think justified homicides including times when cops shoot someone in self defense and it's justified right in self defense shooting.

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       So forth. And so they count times when cops really shouldn't have shot somebody, but did, I'm pretty sure they do. Yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty sure they do. But even then that number would be exceedingly marginal comparatively. Right? So then you have the remaining number which are. And then you have like three to five. I know, I think it was 15 percent of justified. Three to five percent are accidents. Three to five percent a lot. Yeah. No, it's with 900 people. 900 people a year. Right. So, and I tweeted this, I said again, if we focused on firearm safety education, we could, that number will drop in half. It might be you're not gonna, you're gonna fix the intelligence level of the human. See as fucking around with guns. That's where you underestimate the fact in the nursemaid how those people are dying because accidentally, because there were a lot of people who don't understand basic gun safety, right?

Speaker 1:          00:22:02       Within that 900, it's a lot of them. Um, when you see some of the accidents that happens with firearms, they're easily mitigated by just simply knowing the four rules of firearm ownership. And when you get into the gun community, like as a whole, you follow that rabbit instance like we are, we're crazy about gun safety. You, you, you put your finger on a trigger and a picture. We're slaughtering you. Yeah. Not Literally, but you know what you're saying. Yeah. Like we're going to hold your accountability. I have a friend who has so many guns. He doesn't know how many guns. How many guns you have. I don't know Justin. I know you're listening. He's a legit gun. Nut and great guy. Yeah. And I don't know how many guns I have, either a fucking crazy person. I mean hell, I mean I guess. I mean, but then again I didn't shoot my first gun.

Speaker 1:          00:22:47       Toilet Twenty three, 24. Yeah. So that, did that just become crazy all of a sudden? I think I was about the same age. Yeah. Well, I think I shot one when I was real young and I definitely shot one in camp when I was like, I guess I was probably 12, but at that I didn't count that I've shot my first handgun when I first came to California and I might've been really on it. Well, what's ironic is it's way easier to get a gun here. That is New York. I lived in New York too. Fucking hard to get a handgun in New York. Almost impossible. You legally? You mean? Legally or illegally? Okay. Yeah. No, I mean when I came here it was a 1994 I guess, maybe 93, 94. I bought a gun and I was like, I can't believe I just buy a gun to the check. Yeah, yeah. I bought A. I'm about 38 special about a Walter p, P K, and I bought a glock nine millimeter

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       or made a good taste. I'm a fan. I'm a fan of the PDK as well. Yeah, it's a cute little gun. Well, when I first came to California and her all this crazy shit about drive by shootings and gang violence, I just thought it was just going to be a fucking war zone out here. There's a funny thing about it is it's your natural disposition was I need something to protect myself. It's such a natural thought process. I don't know why we've perverted it to this deal where it's like something has to be wrong with you. If you had that mentality or that there's a lot of people that haven't experienced real violence, you know, and then if you've experienced real violence and you've seen what happens when you have a terrible person around people that aren't terrible, that's for sure. That's a reality that people don't like to face and they don't like to look at the other side of the coin.

Speaker 2:          00:24:32       Like whenever there's an instance where there's a shooter, the shooter gets taken out by someone who's a trained person who's trained with firearms and and knows tactics. Nobody wants to talk about that. That just gets brushed off. They don't. There's not a balanced conversation to be had. There isn't an interesting thing is I have a group to have a group chat when stuff like that does happen, they write it off as just anomalies. Right? How's that an anomaly? That's what exactly what it's supposed to be used for. Again, like I said, confirmation bias and cognitive and distances are, are, is a bitch. We all suffer from it, right? To an extent. For sure. Um, but when you add in the component of fear, right? For a lot of people, they don't necessarily hate guns. The sequences of being shot or someone they love being shot in.

Speaker 2:          00:25:18       One of the thing about it is though, you know, those people never put themselves in a position of being the shooter. They always put themselves in a position of being the victim of a shooting. So that's why you get, well, why do you need that? Because they don't see it as, okay, this allows me to better defend myself. They look at it from the perspective of, well, if you're able to have that, then you might use that against me. And you know, there's also the, the looming specter of the mass shooter. It's just so fucking common these days. It seems like every three or four months there's a new instance, how many times per cent happened. Perception is a bitch, but the reality is the absolute reality is they have happened. They are horrific and there's more of them here than anywhere else in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:26:07       That's reality, but here's the good. So when you say that you're talking about the developer world, correct your, because that's usually the caveat they like to play on. There's no mass shootings in the undeveloped world is people don't just go into a fucking mall and shoot people up. What's windshield shade? It's rare. Very rare. Where people take it happens more than people realize. It just doesn't. It just doesn't. A report on how many people die in Chicago in a weekend, over a weekend that doesn't get reported. That's true, but we live in America where we have complete access to information that is true, but it's a different kind of violence because it's people that are actively to get people that are actively trying to get them. It's gang violence. Whereas school shootings are completely innocent. School shootings are the worst, right? Because it's a child and some fucking psycho decides to make the most noise possible by going into a school and shooting it up.

Speaker 2:          00:26:57       That's the scariest and the worst for most people. For most. When you think about gang violence, you say, well, that's violent. It's terrible that people got shot, but it's people that are trying to shoot each other. All right, so then when I tell you that the remaining homicides in this country, right at 30,000 number that I gave you manually, over 80 percent of that is gang violence. That's crazy to think and believe it. I believe you, but it's when you see Sandy Hook, when you see Parkland, when you see any that the shooting in Colorado, Aurora in the movie theater, when you see these mass shootings, these are what terrify people. Yeah. People are not necessarily terrified of the gang violence in Chicago. You know, I'm going to Chicago in a couple of months and not one fucking person has brought up, hey man, it places a warzone. Everybody's like, oh, I love Chicago.

Speaker 2:          00:27:44       You're going to get deep dish pizza like nobody knows your fly. Is that what it is? Yeah. No, I'm not going to the south side. Do. See, that's the thing. I just went to Chicago. It was just in Chicago. I was here and they were like, well, you locked and loaded. Did you wear a vest? Yes, I'm dead serious. I got all those questions, but I said I was going to Chicago. Those are the first things that people told me. Now, granted I did go to south side. I did feel like. Yeah, we did. Would you. Were you nervous? Were you walking around? I wasn't nervous. I'm not superman man. So when you're walking around, he's strapped a not in Chicago because it's illegal for me to be. That's what's crazy is that Chicago has really strict gun laws and that they don't work at all.

Speaker 2:          00:28:19       I was driving down a road where there were like six, seven, eight dudes who jumped in front of the car when we drove in there because we didn't look like we belonged there and I'm positive. Every single one of them had a gun. They jumped in front of the car. Well, they didn't like little lob, their bodies in front of the car. But you know, you, you said Carl, this unfamiliar driving down the side streets. So they tried to stop you. Uh, they didn't try to stop me. I think you're trying to figure out who the hell we were going over. They were just trying to surface. Yeah. So it's kind, Kinda one of those things, right? But then again, when you're driving around, you're driving down the side street and south side Chicago. We go pros on the car. Oh, that's true. Right. So you kind of have that.

Speaker 2:          00:28:56       Um, so we all agree that gun violence, especially in terms of mass shootings is one of the biggest problems that we have in terms of like a horrific public image problem, right? It's uh, it's, it's something that you see in everybody. When I say public image, I should, what I should, I should phrase that what I mean as a public perception problem. Like you, you see it and it's just death and violence and children and innocence. And we as, as people I think consider the death of innocence to be one of the most egregious and horrific deaths. So I think we both agree on. Absolutely. So. So that's 100 percent across the board. I think with any decent person. These mass shootings are horrific. I think in my opinion, the, the, the number one aspect of the argument that's not being discussed is the mental health aspect of it.

Speaker 2:          00:29:50       Are you opposed to more screening of people to get guns? Yes and no. Yes and no. Yes. In that, in an ideal world, if we could minority report it and figure it out. Who you. I mean, minority report. I mean just like check to see if they're on metal, mental health medication. But I mean we, we currently have. We'll see. Here's the thing, this slippery slope with that too. So what would constitute somebody being on mental health medication that's prohibitive, but if I would, if I deal with anxiety, if I'm on Susanne's prescribed, is that prevent me from owning a firearm? That's a good question. In California for the longest time, they were trying to make it. If you had a medical marijuana card, you couldn't have a firearm. I think they were doing that federally. I think that there was a federal thing that if you had a legal medical marijuana card that they were trying to prevent people they were trying to prevent people from.

Speaker 2:          00:30:37       They were trying to be trying to cripple the marijuana industry because they knew that people wanted guns because to be honest, it's intellectually dishonest. If I can, if I can go to the store with a gun on me and buy alcohol, right? Like, and you know me, I'm not, I don't even smoke. Right. But let's just be honest about it. Like alcohol, weed. I mean I think utilizing that as a prohibitive means to own a firearm. I think it's. I think that is true. But if you were under the influence, some of the Shit I got in the studio, I. No, you're super paranoid. I didn't undo a gun and say, I didn't say under the influence. I said if I could all the all the marijuana card. Does this allow you to buy it? No. One hundred percent. But I'm saying that is an issue if you're under the influence and you have a gun, right?

Speaker 2:          00:31:23       Yeah. But I'm allowed to. But I have you go to my house right now. I have all types of whiskeys at home. Right. But if you're under the influence, right? Yeah. But yeah. So I can't, I can't carry a firearm and then drunk. Right. You can't, you shouldn't be drunk with a gun. You shouldn't be high as fuck when the gun. Neither one of those good ideas. And nor should you be driving. Nor should you be driving. So should you be on Xanax with a gun? That's the question I don't know the answer to because I've never had xanax. Exactly. Me Neither. I don't know what it's like, but I do know that there's been people that have killed people when they were on Xanax. And you know that guy in Vegas, this shooter in Vegas, that guy was on anti anxiety medication. I didn't know that Chris Cornell was on anti anxiety medication when he killed themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       Look, it's got a profound effect on some individuals and it's not uniform the way it affects you. It might affect change with different. Totally different. It's a different. I mean I know, I know tons of people who are on it. Yeah, I do. And they respond. Like you said, they respond to it differently. Yeah. And I know tons of people on it will also drink while they're on it, which you're not supposed to. Yeah. And that, that's not good either. Yeah. It's screening with the screening component. Right? You got to be careful because what it then does, it's like, it becomes a de facto way of preventing people to own firearms arbitrarily. Right. So I was like, oh, well you have anxiety or even even somebody who's maybe dealing with PTSD, not everybody's dealing with PTSD is as a potential murderous, ravenous 100 percent person who just want to go out and kill people.

Speaker 2:          00:32:55       Um, so with the screening component, that's why I say yes or no. Right. If you can find a way, if you can find a way to establish a screw, a mental screening bit, even then no, because there's, there's a, there's a due process aspect to it as well. Right? So you can prevent me from owning and you can't prevent me from exercising a right if I haven't done something to absolve myself from being able to do that legally. Right. Okay. So what if they come to your house and you've got, let's say you've got like a cork board up and you've got all these pictures of schools and fucking arrows pointing to the emergency exits and plans of how to block things off. And then pictures of Jodie foster and pictures of serial killers up everywhere. And you're on anti anxiety medications in the cops.

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       Talked to you and your fucking squirrely as hell. You haven't done anything? No. Arrest me. Then if you can arrest me, arrest can't. If you can't arrest me for, for a crime or possibly attempting to because like, like you know, like the legal standard is like taking substantial act to commit a crime even though you don't do it. That's attempted. Did you hear about the kid that got kicked out of school? Um, what was the school? Who was an Asian kid? Died his hair blonde, started collecting bullets, got a semi automatic rifle. His friend started freaking out, they called the cops, cops came to visit him, he bought another rifle and I believe they deported them. They deported him for reasons not having to do with the firearms. They deported him for reasons that he wasn't actually going to anymore is on a green card or visa, I believe.

Speaker 2:          00:34:26       But the way the sheriffs were framing it was they deported because they wanted this fucking psycho out of the country and they think that they might've prevented a crime. They probably did, but they still had. They still had to establish a legal basis for deporting did all they had. Was that, that he didn't go to class. I mean, that's something you've done. I've done. Yeah. Yeah. I mean everybody is. But then again, he wasn't a citizen. Right. So, and that was, that was, that was a requirement for him to continue to be here. But it was really, it was Kinda like Kinda got like Al Capone, you know, they got a component by tax evasion by way of, you know. Right, right, right. But he really had guns and was acting crazy and that's why the kids that were friends with them called and that's why they acted and they just found that loophole.

Speaker 2:          00:35:08       Yeah. So what do you do with someone like that? Other than that, I mean this guy, we had something. What if this kid was still going to school? I mean it be, it'd be pretty bad, pretty bad. But, but then again, we still, we still have our laws for a reason, right? We have, we have our inherent rights for a reason. Have to due process for a reason. Because if we didn't have those right, anyone could just come up and say, man, you know what I saw I saw calling you on the war on instagram the other day. He a picture of a god and he

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       was like cursing people out because they're making fun of him in the water he was drinking and so you know what? Somebody needs to go check on them and make sure he's okay and somebody is going to take his guns away from him. You've got to. There's got to be through process. I appreciate that. And I agree with you and, and it's, it's unfortunate in that some people may slip through the cracks, but, but I can arrest someone for something that they haven't done yet. You just, you just can't. Well I agree. And so that's where we are right now. So then, so then that now we're getting to the complexities the hardest of the hard questions, right? What do we do? How do we put something in place to catch the people who do happen to fall between the cracks? Right. So then you go, okay, well try to keep up. Sorry, I'm moving. I don't know if you saw a hydro.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       The complexities. Yeah, it's, it's a very complex issue, which is why we're not largely not having it and we're having it here because no one wants to have this conversation on the national scene because it's hard and it doesn't make for great sound bite and it doesn't make for good TV. Right? Because if I hate doing cable news hits because I have two minutes to basically reduce a complex issue that we've been debating for decades, almost centuries. It's the worst and it's also people talking over each other and there's one or two boxes, one guy here, one guy there. Usually you're not even in the same room to go there. You're talking to those earpieces. There is a delay. Those things are a disaster or horrible. One of the worst ways to communicate, which is why I try to establish my platform or my show war.

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       I try to have it as a platform that's open to people to come on, hey look, you want to come on and discuss this issue? By all means come to it. Have you had anyone that's the really strict anti-gun on. Yeah. I had A. I had an entire season, so what we did in the season, I think it was two seasons ago, we brought on a young lady and a guy from New Zealand, I can't remember, but he came on the show. They were anti and so what we did was he had a round table discussion at the end of every episode of my show and we will bring up a specific topic and we discuss it and so they basically was like two against one essentially until they would talk to me about what their thoughts on, on what we talked about in the show or a particular gun control issue and we had that conversation had an individual.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       I sit down with her as well when we talked about it and then took her to the shooting range to shoot for the first time, you know, but that's going to be overlooked. Right. They know they ignore it. Well they probably aren't even aware of it because I wasn't aware of it. Another, wherever you think people who need to be aware of it, aware of it because like for instance, I bring this point up and it makes me come across as if like I feel some type of way cause he didn't mention me, but it's not really that. It just speaks volumes to what I've been pointing at for the longest. They ignore rational discourse. John Oliver did a 20 minute monologue on Nra tv about NITV, right? Twenty minutes. You know how long? Twenty minutes long. I guess that's a long time. He didn't me once.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       He didn't mention my shot. I have three shows on NITV, three shows and I had the second longest, longest running show on nitv. He didn't mention me once. The level of detail that they went into within that monologue lets me know. They watched everything on that platform. They watched it all. Why do you think you left? Because they didn't fit the narrative. Right? Also because he is a progressive guy with glasses who's white and you really shouldn't you really sit and say anything negative about black people? How so? He's but he's not white though. He's a minority. Just like me. What is he? He's. I don't know. He's like, I don't want Oliver. He's white. It's not white. What is he doing? If he's not white? I'm not white. What the fuck is he? Irish, Irish. My white. If I'm not, what the fuck is. If I saw you on the street, you are in the olden days. I wasn't. My grandparents weren't white when my grandparents came over. That guy's white over white. He's white. White Paper, isn't it? Yeah. Oh Shit. I'm wrong. Well, there you go. What did you think he was? I don't know. I never thought about him confused with the daily show guy. I probably am Trevor Noah. You know, not trevor. I know, but I know about trevor. Yeah, he's white as fuck. There's a white Englishman. Minimum Racist.

Speaker 2:          00:39:56       But for a guy like that, guys like that have dave. Here's the thing about progressives and I like John Oliver. I'm not. I'm not negative against John. I'm going to start doing a show. I have. I had this perspective up until this point. So I'm going to shut off. I'm going to shut off my belief system and listen to you and listen to what you're about to say because I haven't thought about this because I thought he wasn't white to this entire time. So. So yeah. So now he's white as fuck, right? I mean, it might not even above what. Bye. He did it. He might've found the worst examples and maybe you were too reasonable and it doesn't fit the narrative of being funny. I mean his show, although his show has points and he makes these very clear conclusions and you know, but it's funny. It's a funny show. That's the whole thing behind it is like any girl who's dating me knows like I have enough episodes on, on, on, on that platform. You could find some stuff to make fun of me about Paul. I'm sure they could, but I don't think that's the kind of thing they're trying to make fun of, like individual personalities that say stupid shit. I think what they're trying to do is point out the disingenuous narrative from the NRA while ignoring the disingenuous narrative from the anti gun advocates. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:41:12       I could possibly see that. I'm trying to. I'm trying to be fair and reasonable because my mind wants to go, Nah, he saw he. He realized that by mentioning me. Right. It's going to. It's going to peak curiosity with the audience in which he's trying to. So you think your two reasonable into logical in that since you're not like this redneck, he haw type character that like talk about you. It doesn't fit their narrative salicious ignore him because that's a trade on the dummies. Think about it, but everybody was still real though, right? Don't have domains on all sides. That's true. That's true. But it's pretty easy to find like pro gun dummies. You can find quite a few of them. I can pretty easy to find dummies on the other side as well for sure. But you wouldn't be looking if you were on that side, right?

Speaker 2:          00:41:56       If you're on the anti gun side, you're looking for program dummies. Pro Gun dummies. Yeah. Pro Gun dummies are easy to find. They are right. There's plenty of them right now. You can go fucking find him on instagram and twitter and there's, there's dummies all over the world and say, here's the thing though, the thing about what John Oliver does, and that's the thing. This is the kind of disingenuous nature of satire and political satire. It, I call it the, the, uh, the comedian plausible deniability card. Right. Okay. So you can make a joke about something and then say, oh, it has no influence because it's just a joke. It's not. But he's not saying that as he. He's not saying it doesn't have any influence. What exactly he understands the influence at wields, but he's. But he's saying, but he can. He can always swipe the plausible deniability card and say, well no, I wasn't making an actual political statement like I know that there reasonable people on the other side.

Speaker 2:          00:42:45       No, you're pushing a narrative that has been pushed for decades about an organization that fights for the second amendment, the same, the same, the same narrative that's being pushed by groups of people who say the only thing standing in their way of more gun control is the NRA. So what do you do? So where does it to make it as power from? Because they, they, they talk out of both sides of their mouth. They don't get the power from there. I'm sorry. They don't get power by their membership. Right? Right. So what do you do? You do your best to stifle that membership. You make it seem as unattractive as possible and then you also, your audience has already largely uneducated on the issue. Right, and he was already this perceived notion at the Nras, just a bunch of racist white rednecks. Right? So then what?

Speaker 2:          00:43:30       Then what do you do to further that narrative? You talk about their platform and then you pull out all of those things that further drive that narrative while ignoring the most popular figure on the platform, which is, which is me, and so who so happens to be black. So what does that say? It tells me that this, that it was deliberate. I really do want to agree with you and say, you know what? He's white. He didn't want to be seen as attacking the black guy. So forth and so on. I think there's a little of that, but I think there's also. He's doing a show and let. Let me, let me explain how the show works. He's got a team of writers. There's a ton of people back there. They are just trying to be funny. They're trying to make points for sure, but they're trying to find stupid shit that they can mock and why would they concentrate on the guy that makes sense if they're looking for stupid shit that they come up, they're not trying to make a balanced reasonable argument like maybe we would do right here.

Speaker 2:          00:44:19       Right now. What they're doing is doing a condensed, edited down, very smooth, polished television show with that rent has been dissected and gone over by a team of writers and they have video that corresponds it and photographs that they shoot go to and they have clips that they show them. They mock the clips. It's a comedy show. They do have a point, but it's a comedy show. Absolutely agree with. That's why they didn't go after you is because maybe you're a lawyer. Maybe you're articulate. Maybe you is because you're young and black and they just don't feel like it's a smart thing to do, but it's because they're making a show. I agree with you. Now. Let me tell you why my panties on a ruffle about it just because I understand the influence of that show. When people make political decisions, but don't you think it's preaching to the choir that show?

Speaker 2:          00:45:02       What do you mean? That one, that show? Yeah, John Oliver show. I think if I had to guess how many people who are watching the show are left wing leaning, democratic leaning, liberal leaning. I would say it's a giant percentage. Here's the problem though. The number of people who come to me and say, I don't. I don't deal with the NRA because they're racist and there are a bunch of white rednecks who says that? Oh God, I get it all the time. The evidence that they point to, they just assume that they're racist. They, that's, that's just it. Because in their, in their attempts to just make a show. Right, and I agree with you wholeheartedly. I absolutely agree with you, but we can't undermine how influential that show is at crafting people's thoughts about particular issues and ideologies within this country. Right? And so I stand back and I'm like, man, this is dangerous because to meet the second amendment is incredibly important.

Speaker 2:          00:45:55       Right. I don't know what the funny thing is. I thought the monologue was hilarious. Funny Dude. Mama monologue is hilarious. I'll give. I'll give him the model I'm arguing with. My log was funny then. Isn't even funny dude, because he said that funny. He was a funny dude during that 20 minute mile. Sometimes he's not to demonstrate you got. No. You got to demonstrate consistency. Consistency. You give me some consistency. I'll let you drop the ball a couple times here and there. That's fine. But as far as consistency, it's tough job. Know John Oliver Guy. He's got a tough job. I think it's. I think it's incredibly tough. I think. I think comedians don't get enough credit. I make sure it's even a real comedian. Stand up. This John Oliver, is that. Is that. Is that the barometer for being a comedian? Stand up for us. It's a big.

Speaker 2:          00:46:39       There's a big difference. I stand up to me, terrifies me, but the thought of ever having to keep them on. I'll get in front of a million people and talk all day long, but the thought of Standup, see I get to quote some of my humor and seriousness. Right? So it's easier, right? I can do stuff here and there, like, oh, he's kind of funny. Well, no, it's only because it's contrasting against something that's serious and you don't expect to humor. Do you remember the way you felt before you walked into that shooting range and those guns were going off and you're like, holy shit, it's really happening now. Think about how you feel now when you walk into the range. Like I go to the range. Yeah. I go to the range all the time. You know, especially when I was rifle hunting, I would go to the range least once a month.

Speaker 2:          00:47:16       Yeah. And you know, got used to it. You Go, you hear the bang, Bang, Bang, put your headphones on. He just walk up and say hi to everybody that you see there all the time. Everybody's super polite at the range. That's one thing, man. People polite as fuck at the range because everybody around you has the ability to kill you. They're just not everybody around you. Especially when. I mean I was in the rifle section, I've got a 300 win mag. I'll blow a fucking door outdoors, outdoors, outdoors, Jesus. That's the God damn cannon, you know, and everybody around you got one of these things to. Everybody can kill everybody and everybody's like, hey man, how you doing? What's up? How's everybody doing? Everybody super friendly but shaking hands. There's a mutual respect there, but it's interesting. That's an interesting. I mean that's a weird statement that gets thrown about a lot of times that, oh well armed society is a polite society.

Speaker 2:          00:48:07       Let me. There were two times in my life where I felt vehemently insecure the first time I carried a gun out of my house and my first mma class. Oh yeah, that makes sense. But what I was going to say is when you go to the gun range a bunch of times, then it becomes normal comes life. That's what standup is. Gotcha. Same thing. I mean you still can eat plates, a Dick's on stage on occasion to go south and it's terrible. It's the worst feeling good about Texas. Fucking dead on and hilarious. Oh, were you there? No, I just thought which, which bit? Which bit where you were basically about bikinis or all the Lions and tigers, people that keep the Tigers. That shit's true. Basically talking about we need these people without fighting wars and people who have Santa Monica. That is true, man, that people who've never been to Texas do not understand.

Speaker 2:          00:49:03       That is the America of American don't play. No, we. Texas doesn't play. We are the most arrogant some bitches on the planet. It's also like what? When people think of America overseas, they think of like these fucking crazy people with guns that have jacked up trucks that are driving too fast. The girls have big tits. The guy's a fucking crazy. That's what we think of. That's Texas like this, not American now as a whole. It's Texas is the most exaggerated form of it. Texas houses the most exaggerated form of that. Yes. There's a lot of cool people in Texas. Texas is way more diverse. People in Austin, which is like super left on the Austin is like California and Texas a little bit, but I think it's a little cooler. It's smaller, but it's the. The thing I said about about Texas that's true is there's more tigers in captivity in Texas than there are in all of the wild of the world.

Speaker 2:          00:49:56       More Tigers in private collections. That's fucking true, and when I read that, I was like, oh my God, I have to figure out a way to make this funny, craziest fucking statistic I've ever heard in my life, in people's yards. Not gonna lie to you. I grew up. I grew up my entire life in Texas wanting to Cheetah Cheetah and they're beautiful man. Beautiful, beautiful man. And just watching. The funny thing is I get a cheetah and put it in and put it in the yard. No bigger than this room and inspect to see the beauty of it running. Well, you know, it's also fucked up. I don't think you're allowed to like just feed them animals. I don't think you're allowed to just let loose a goat and have a. have the Cheetah tackle the goat and fuck it up. I think you have to feed them meat.

Speaker 2:          00:50:39       You know, like, like already curing process. You're allowed to have some wild kingdom shit. Go down in your yard. I don't think they allow them. Oh No, you did say we only have three pages of law. So if it's not to say, you know what I'm saying? Shit about tigers ordered enough new, order it up. You know, the funny thing about it is when I got into firearms, I lived in Texas my whole life and I went 23 years without ever shooting gun, touching the gun. And when I got into it, I started the first thing I wanted to do with shoe competition. Right? And so you should competition do this competition. It's like John Wick style where you go to bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. Three gun, they call it three guns, three guns. So basically three gun consists of three different, three different platforms or rifle, shotgun and a handgun.

Speaker 2:          00:51:26       So how does this competition work? So basically they just set up basic set up various courses where you have to utilize one of those three platforms. Some of the courses you utilize all three. And so it's just, it's just in there, you're set to a timer. You got to clear the courses as fast as possible. Uh, yeah. In the clearing the choruses are you, is there like walls that you have to look behind you? You're only limited by your imagination. Do you ever see that shit with Keanu reeves was preparing for John Wick Two? Yeah. Oh, you were there. I wasn't. Okay. So I was there not for that particular video that went viral, but I was there one day when he was training and so I met him after the fact. How is he different?

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       Is He, he's, um, a spacey. Spacey. Yeah. Interesting. But not in a bad way. It's a very, very calm energy. Um, you know, why, why that's how he handles being that famous. Gotcha. And I just shut up. I picked up on it immediately. Then it wasn't, it wasn't bad. It was, it wasn't a bad thing. It's a good thing. You got to realize he's the matrix guy. That's some over the top fame. He hit that Johnny Depp or Tom Cruise level of fame and then just became this super chill, mellow guy that can just like go through crowds that kind of goes and sits on the subway by himself. No, like freaking awesome. Yeah. But there's no obvious outward displays of wealth from him and he's insanely wealthy. When you see him. He's dressed like me. He's got like a regular watch on and sneakers. He's normal as fuck man.

Speaker 2:          00:53:02       It's, it's real weird. Like he's, he's figured out a way to avoid like there is right there on the fucking subway, just chilling, you know, and he looks like a totally normal dude. Yeah. Well, and people freak out. They're like, is that no, I can't be like, people ignore him because he's figured out a way to just sort of just layer in plain sight. And then even if you talk to him, he's just normal. Like everybody that I know that's met him. I said the dudes like totally look at it. He lets his chicks it down, you know? He said, do you want to sit down? Go ahead. Boom. And he just stands up. Look at it, I mean even the ways he's not, no body guards,

Speaker 1:          00:53:37       you know, what's interesting about his demeanor and how he doesn't have this sense of entitlement and I'm bringing it back, bringing it back to the gun thing a little bit. The first time I carried a gun. Um, remember I told you those are the two most, the times where I felt more insecure was my first day in mma and carrying a gun for the first time. But carrying that gun for the first time made me realize, Oh shit, I'm not the only one. Right? So it actually humbled me and from the standpoint that knowing that you don't know who you're dealing with and when you carry a firearm on you, you have the ability to go from zero to 100 like that. And so you develop a respect for that. Also, you start to develop a respect for life as well because you understand how fragile you start to realize how fragile it is.

Speaker 1:          00:54:23       And so for me, I actually became more docile. Like I don't get road rage because I understand and because I live in Texas, we don't do that. No, it's not. But I also know that like there's so much responsibility that comes with carrying a firearm. It's an unreal. Um, and so for people who go out of the means to learn to do it and be able to do it, like there's a certain level of respect you have to have for it because it comes with a lot. There's certain places you can't go. Certain things you can't do things you have to be cognizant of. Like, so I started, I actually started staying away from certain places because I knew I had a gun on me and I never wanted to have to be put in a situation, actually have to go for it. Did you wear a gun all the time? What if I can do it legally? I have

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       really? Yeah. And what is the idea behind that? Is that like it's better to have it not to need it than to need it not to have it? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       Yeah, it's, it's an, it's no different. It's literally just a part of my routine. Watch, watch keys, phones, wallet, Gun, one of the chamber or no one in the chamber. Oh and yeah, safety on chambered the gun. I usually carry doesn't, they don't have external safeties. It's just I, I carry in the holster. So if you carry the holster it shouldn't be an issue. Wow. Yeah. That's interesting. So you just want to be really, really ready. Yeah. Well see he don't want to have to know and see. Here's the thing. That's that. That's progressive. I wasn't always like that. I started off not caring with one in the chamber. Why wouldn't you just start putting one in the chamber? When I started understanding and trusting the mechanics of a firearm, because when I started caring I knew about guns. I didn't trust the mechanics. Right, right. So you, that extra step, you don't feel like it's necessary of like. No. What do you mean? In terms of like having A. Well, I understand that. I understand. So I started doing training, right? And started training with the guns in self defense and stuff like that. And I started realizing, you know, so the gun isn't, isn't an end all, be all right. It's just a tool that I carry with me that could possibly save my life. I still dog with a gun

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       on me for sure. All right. Um, but I'd started weighing the disadvantages and the advantages of having one in the chamber. Right. I might find myself in a situation where, you know, what I have time to, okay, I'm behind here and I have time to rack it and do what I need to do. There may be other times where I won't, but if I already have a round in the chamber, those times where I will have the time and not have the time won't make a difference because there's already one of the chamber ready to go. Yeah. So from that perspective, um, as I got more comfortable with the gun and realize, holy crap, the gun never just went off on its own because it was an inherent fear there. Right. It's like, you don't want the gun to go off while I was in your pants.

Speaker 2:          00:57:02       You have like one of them Chi decks holsters. It's form fitted gun. Yeah. I have tons of holes. I have a box for the holster show you because I reviewed guns and review and gear and stuff, so I'm constantly switching, which is a gift and a curse because you know I never perfect any platform, but I can you put any pretty much any gun in my hand I can use decently now when things happen, whenever there's a mass shooting or something, immediately people want to blame gun owners or people that want to protect gun owners and specifically NRA members. This comes down on you. Sometimes it's always a problem. It comes down to people that want guns and the people that don't want regulations and don't want additional screening. We. Yeah, because you've got to think about it. So like the figureheads when you, when you started talking about Wayne and there people go after them clearly, but then also you have the personalities of the brand, which is me, Dana and Dana.

Speaker 2:          00:58:01       Dana, Dana last, right. She's an official spokesperson. Right. It's a very nice lady. I met her. Exactly. And then you have mentorship, Cam Edwards, it shows. Well, exactly, and so what tends to happen is I get it a lot via social because that's how I built my brand. I built my brand through social and so most people will when they can't descend, like I don't think Wayne Lapierre has a twitter page, you know what I mean? He doesn't have an instagram account so it was probably in a bunker somewhere. He's not counting ammo. More noble than I believe you. Well you're. What you are is an interesting version of the NRA is like, oh this is the NRA too. Like there's a kind of a new thing. It's multifaceted. I dare anyone to go to the NRA annual meetings and then if you can, I don't know how secluded is.

Speaker 2:          00:58:52       Go to the board meeting. You have a dinner meetings. You'll be surprised they'll have I every race you can think of different sexualities. You name it. Oh, I believe it was in the NRA forever. I just admired, let my membership lapse like a year and a half ago, but I was in the NRA because I just felt like I know people that are just like, we've got to get rid of the guns. I'm like, man, I don't think that's going to do it and I don't think that's going to stop anything. And I ask people this all the time. I've done it on my show. I call it the big red button question, right?

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       So he put a big red button. I'd asked him if I put a big red button in the middle of table, if you push this button, all the guns on the planet disappear. What'd you do it? And then I'll get various answers, but I wouldn't do it. And people are like, why? Like why would you not be the end of violence?

Speaker 2:          00:59:36       Not really. It's also the end of defense. Exactly. Especially when you're talking about military. I mean if you can't, if you don't have guns, like what are we going to fight with swords and bows and arrows and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       Do you know the interesting thing about that too is a lot of people are either side will say they were like, why? The same people will say, well why do you need an Ar 15? And then in an inverse when I say the Second Amendment is actually not about hunting, it's about defending ourselves from a tyrannical government, domestic or foreign. They're like, oh, you think you little stupid guns are going to be able to defend against the, against the government. And I'm like, well then why don't you give me the guns that the government has done? And then they get quiet because they realized the contradiction in what they're stating.

Speaker 2:          01:00:13       Well, it's also the government. When you say the government, like protect us against the government, we are the government. The government's filled with people like the cops are us. The problem is, is this separation of us. If you gave me a red button, said would I, could I end all senseless violence by hitting that button? I would say yes. And then when people say it's a gun's problem, I said, do you know that London Past New York City for the first time since 1800 in homicides, and they did it with fucking nice with knives to the point where that goofball mayor of London, that Dork on his twitter page said, there's no reason to carry a knife. If you get caught carrying a knife, you will be prosecuted under the fullest extent of the law. This is the fucking knife. But I've got a knife.

Speaker 2:          01:00:57       Oh I don't have it on me right now, but I have a knife on me all the time. It's the same country that the utilizes the shining example of what we should be doing in America. Exactly. And they have more murders in London from knives. And here's the funny thing about that too, you know like in. So they have an uptake and acid attacks. Sorry, I think I'd rather be shot. Yeah, that acid. Well that's a, that's a thing that people are doing to ex wives and shit too. Yeah, that's ducks. I mean is that is dark. That is some human shit. But it's also will all of this stuff, it comes down to like what makes a fully developed person instead of looking at what's available to a fully developed person and what would allow fully developed person to commit horrific crimes. What turns a person into that we should be looking at it from the root to the fully grown. Like what is the process that allow someone to become a mass shooter? What's the process that allow them to throw acid in someone's face?

Speaker 1:          01:01:53       Because I have, you know, I clearly have to frame everything to my perspective because I know what the best. But like even for me, like I said it in video before, if I ever had to pull my gun and shoot someone to take a life, I'm going to. I'm going to need therapy. Yeah, I am. Because because I value life that much. I value it.

Speaker 2:          01:02:10       Great. Do you have children? No, I don't. Let me tell you something, man. If he had kids and some guy was trying to hurt your daughter and he shot him, I think he'd sleep like a baby. But you know what? That's interesting you say that because when I talked to women about firearm ownership, right, like none of the girls know girls I've ever been in a relationship with were like pro gun. Right? But over time, you know, dealing with me, I mean when you walk into my house and there's five rifles on the table, you kind of just have to get acclimated. But in dealing with women who started off initially as anti, a lot of them talk about not wanting guns because they can't see themselves taking the life. But the moment I asked them would they take a life to protect a child?

Speaker 2:          01:02:47       Oh yeah, I'm blowing that sucker away, you know? And it's interesting how that works. How we. And I, I felt like I agree with you, I'd be the same way to a child and you know that whatever it is that turns a child into some monster there, Katrina, but school, I think that's what needs to be examined. I mean this is not a part of the narrative. It's not a part of the discussions. No one's bringing it up. All people bring up is the event themselves, the gun violence, and we need to keep. Keep the tools away from people. I just think the tools are one part of the problem. I definitely think that you should. If there was a way we should figure out a way to keep psychopaths from owning guns, but how do you determine whether or not someone's a psychopath so they do something psychopathic?

Speaker 2:          01:03:30       Yeah, and then someone will talk about, well, you know Australia, they had one mass shooting in the 19 nineties. They took all the guns. There's 18 people in Australia. It's as big as the United States. There's less people. Not to mention crime went up after they did that, did it. Bottling crime went up when they did that. That's what people don't want to talk about. And in your right, like people forget context. They're like two people in Australia. What do you know? What about this one town in Georgia were firearm ownership is mandatory. I do remember hearing it and they made it mandatory and violent crime and everything dropped radically. Break Ins dropped radically. They made it mandatory. Everybody has to have a gun, and everybody was like, fuck a crime. I think about it. I need to find a new way to make a living because most dudes like, look, most dudes who engaged in crime, right?

Speaker 2:          01:04:15       Like of course you have your Sickos who just loved the violence, right? Most of them just crimes of opportunity. So they're looking for victims. They're looking for easy victims, easy targets. If you're going to deal with someone who possibly is going to kill you, they don't want to die. Which is why you've seen a lot of these videos with these home invasions where you watch when the actual homeowner has a firearm. Once the shot start, once the bullets start flying, they're gone. They're taken off. Nobody wants to get shot. So and so. It always boggles my mind when people are like, Whoa, you don't need a gun for this, or you don't need to go. I'm like, no, I do. And they're like, well, the chances of you ever needing it or using it, that's a stupid idea. It's an incredibly moronic. Sure this. Chances are you've gone through life right now, however old you are, when I'm talking to you, you haven't been shot.

Speaker 2:          01:05:01       So the chances are 100 percent that you didn't need it. Right? But that doesn't mean you won't need any crazy conversation. I don't think the conversation should be about the tools. I really think the conversation should be about what makes a person capable of doing that. I mean, if the conversation is what makes a person's such a fucking nut, that they have so many guns that they don't know what to do with that. I mean, you have so many guns you don't even know how many have is that bad? I don't know. Seemed like a reasonable guy. I'm worried about you, but even then I can only use one gonna come. I only have two hands. I get that. But the idea is like, what if someone breaks in your house and steals your guns? I'm sure you haven't been a safe, but if somebody breaks in your house and steals your gun, it's like, what?

Speaker 2:          01:05:37       So that's my fault. Now that somebody wants to break the law and breaking into my house. No. The idea is like access. Now you're giving access. Yeah. But you eliminate limited. It's a very different argument. You're very different. Yeah, exactly. But you still live. But that fundamentally goes back to the idea that people want to undervalue this is a constitutional right, right? Yeah. Um, and so what we ended up, we find ourselves doing is finding ways to limit that ripe because of the few bad people in our country, you know, and I just think that's the wrong way to go about it because we're basically evolving ourselves down to a point where we're not going to have any rights left because there are a couple of bad people here who might do something bad with the rights that you have. I think it's the wrong way to go about it too.

Speaker 2:          01:06:16       Um, but if you, if we had no violence in this country, if something happened, human beings evolved. If our switch changed and there's no more violence, would you still want to have guns? Yes. You want to happen for recreation because you enjoy them. Yeah. Yeah. That's something people don't want to hear. Yeah. Like I always tell people, if you've never shot a gun, if you've ever gone to a gun range, you should probably should because it is actually fun. It's fun. Now if you do that activity and you're not thinking about hurting someone and all you're thinking about is focusing on the target, trigger control, all that stuff. Is that bad? I mean, we do it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:58       Do anything on my show. We call it athletic shooting. Right? So my background before I got into guns was sports. I was in the basketball, football. I ran cross country track, you name it. So when I got a gun, so my, my dream was to go to the Mba when I was younger. Right. I'm clearly that didn't happen and it wasn't going to. But you know, there was at that athleticism still in me. So what we did on the show when we were talking about coming up with a different shooting competition was how do I incorporate. I thought it, well, how do I incorporate some of the athletic athleticism into shooting, right? Um, which is essentially by and large a lot of running and just shooting a different position and so forth and so on. And so when we're doing that, I know thinking about shooting a person that's not the type of shooting them doing, doing target, you doing target shooting with some athleticism involved in it. And so, and people undervalue that, like it's kind of like how can you not see that these are other ways that firearms are used it, which is why I started my brand new pew, Pew Life, right? People. Life is, is

Speaker 2:          01:08:00       predicated around the EWP, Ewp for people who don't understand that people who use guns like exact firearm lifestyle. Yeah. Hashtag Po Po. Because mean, think about it when we were kids was also simple, right? It's like cops and robbers with gun pew, Pew, Pew, Pew, we do that. And so,

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       but then so I, I, I want to capture the, the recreation involved in playing cops and robbers as a kid, but then also understanding the very definitive and distinction between the good guys and bad guys, right? People who live this lifestyle are good people. They enjoy guns for recreation, they also understand that we live in a world where not everybody is good, right? So we also own guns for our own self defense and so it's this culmination of this lifestyle that comes together and we appreciate guns in a way that some people think is perverse, but, but, but how is it any less? How is it any different than me obsessing over the Aston Martin DB? Yes. For the last 20 years. That is that perverse. It's still, it's still a mechanical item. Yes. The potential for violence is what, what scares people and if they mean when the guy kills 86 people nice with the truck right now.

Speaker 1:          01:09:08       It's a good point. I mean it is a very good point and no one's trying out outlaw trucks. No, but it's this thing that we have in this country where we have more guns than we have human beings and that's, that disturbs people yet because they inherently vilify the firearm, which is why I have another Hashtag that I call still waiting, still waiting for what? Still waiting for my gun to jump up on his own and kill somebody. Um, it's, it's, it is relatively tongue in cheek, but at the same time what it does is it transfers to focus. And then I say, when a drunk driver gets behind, gets behind the wheel and kill someone, we don't blame the vehicle for it. We blame the driver. Right? So when somebody goes out and commits violence with the firearm, why aren't we focusing on the people who were doing good instead of focusing on the firearm?

Speaker 1:          01:09:53       Well, I think we should certainly be focusing on the people as we said, we should certainly be focused on focusing on what happens to a person that makes them develop into the type of person that can go into a movie theater and shoot it up like the rural Colorado. Let's talk about that a little bit because that conversation and we don't have honestly, and I'm not going, I don't have the answers. I can think of several things. You know, the easy answer for me is to say is it's our culture, right? We maybe have a culture that facilitates this or you know, we have situation where there are people who do flip between the cracks. No one pays attention to them. There's certainly some of that. And I do think there is a lack of hand, right? Pay attention to everybody you can't. But then also I think there's, like I was raised by a single parent mother, right.

Speaker 1:          01:10:38       And My mother over compensated when raising me because she understood the limitations of her being a woman raising a young man. Right? So she was unnecessarily hard on me. My mom has zero tolerance for my emotions, absolutely zero. So what she taught me growing up was how to deal with adversity, taught me how to deal with failure, how to get past those things, taught me how to be self assured. And so what I think we're lacking to a degree in this country is people not having the coping mechanisms to deal with failure or to deal with rejection, you know? Um, so I'm getting worse than others. I agree. It

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       was definitely that. There's definitely people that feel like they're outsiders and they want to flip the board over there losing the game and they just want to flip the board over and that seems like that Parkland kid mean there were kids that were worried about him before this ever happened and that his whole thing was that his life was shit and he wanted other people to experience that. Yeah, and the thing is is like the hard thing about it too is not a realizing that just came to my mind. I think sometimes I don't even want to talk about the mental health aspect of it in this particular case with the parking street because I just want to relegate them to evil. Right? Right. Because it pisses me off like you're, you're taking innocent lives because you feel bad. Go in a corner and shoot yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:11:57       If that's the case, there's a romanticized version of that too, where people just want to take everybody out, take all the people out that you saw that were doing well while you were struggling. There's that, put them in, but the world always flips and flips if you've got a good attitude and you're a healthy person like yourself, but if you're mentally ill and your life has been just tormented and abuse and mental health issues and you're all fucked up, it's. I don't know what the answer is, know what the answer is, but I do know that the problem lies in the individuals that are capable of committing that and how did they become that? Because you've got to make a great point cause you got the mindset that you have to be in a walk down the school hall and just shoot people, shoot kids to shoot him.

Speaker 2:          01:12:42       It just innocently just. It's fucking. It's fucking gross. Yeah. Whether it's sandy hook or whatever. Any one of these things like you have to be fucked up to do that. Like as and how many people are running around that are like three quarters fucked up. You only need a few bad things to go wrong in relatively speaking. When you think about the fact that there's 300 plus million people in this country, these are relatively relatively few people that they are capable and that actually act on such terrific have a act, but what do you think can be done to stop this stuff? Have you thought about it? Yeah, I think about it all the time. It's, it's, it's a harder question for me to ask them to come up with ways of why we don't need gun control. Right. You know, because that's, that's, you know, it's hard.

Speaker 2:          01:13:27       Especially when I'm taking gun control off the table because people are always saying, you know, you guys don't, you guys don't want to move one inch. When I was like, yeah, because we'd been moving in Itch for the last 20, 30 years. The problem is it's a, it's a fucked up argument because the people that are holding the guns are not necessarily the people that are doing these things. You're, you're, you're trying to attack the, the vast majority of gun owners are not committing crimes with guns. They're not. So when I think about what can we do to stop, it's different types of shooting. For instance, let's talk. Let's start with the. Let's start with what types of shootings that happened the most gang violence, right? So if you look at the statistics, you think, oh my gosh, Americans' war zone, right? 30,000

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       people a year die in an eight, and in the vast majority of it that is remaining is actual homicides is gang violence. So then we have a gang problem. We'd have a gang problem in this country. We have a socioeconomic problem in very specific areas in this country, right? Because I just came from south side Chicago where I started in high park where Obama used to live and enjoy a few minutes into an area that looked like a bomb went off. They don't have the violence in high park that they had in that area. Why they had the same access to illegal guns. They don't have the same problem because there's a difference in economics and no one wants to do well. No one wants to address that, right? If I'm a kid growing up in that neighborhood and I'm going to a school that Shitty, right?

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       They don't give, they don't give a damn about me. I looked up and was able to go to good schools, right? I went to schools where my teachers cared. I went to schools where teachers pushed me when I was slacking off. You know, I had the ability to take out loans to go to a good law school. You know, I had those abilities. If I'm a kid growing up in this environment and I can't find refuge in my school, I can't find refuge at home because my mom's working three or four or five jobs, so she's never there. Where am I going to go find parents? I'm going to, where am I going to find that parental influence? I'm gonna find on the streets. So now I'm on the streets being led by people who grew up in the exact conditions that I grew up in and so now I'm like, okay, well I have to make money.

Speaker 1:          01:15:35       What am I going to do for money? Well, then there's the Naco economy. Very conveniently right there for me, right? So drugs. So now I'm selling. Now I'm saying on the corner selling drugs, I got to protect my product, right? If I don't, someone's gonna take it from me. So what do I do? I get a gun, I carry a gun. Now I'm stuck in the true. Now I'm just stuck in this violent loop, right? If that feeds on itself, and so now I'm stuck defending myself against the guy who shooting at me, trying to take my stuff and I'm shooting back at him. Maybe not because I'm trying to take your stuff, but because he's trying to take them out, right? So that's where you get that violence that comes from that, from those particular areas. Now, if we would have sat back and said, okay, we have hyper concentrated areas in this country, this is a widespread.

Speaker 1:          01:16:20       It's hyper concentrated communities in this country that are dealing with this, that are also the result of the vast majority of our gun violence. If we sat back and thought about it from a socioeconomic standpoint, how do we fix this? What do we do? How do we present opportunity, I'm not saying go there and just hand out stuff, but how do we fix this from the standpoint of improving our schools? How is that can drive five minutes, one direction and have a school that has everything you can name and then driving into driving the opposite direction. The school has can barely have textbooks to give to the kids. Think about that. So why? Why aren't we focusing our energy on building data up versus talking about, oh, we need to get the guns off the streets. You did that. You had that in Chicago. You have every gun law imaginable in Chicago, but just outside Chicago still looks the way that it does still as a violence that it does. Right? So if we would, if we provide,

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       when you give people something lose or the lift for they don't throw away life so easily. Plain and simple. So if my social economic status is in the dirt, I don't have a problem looking at another kid down the street and shooting at him and taking his life. I don't have anything. I don't have anything to lose. But if we were to focus our attention and fixing that same way we talk about the mental health issue with respect to mass shootings and school shootings, we wouldn't have to worry about the guns because we don't have people wanting to do those things or have the capability to do those things. Right. So then that deals with that vast majority of the violence that we had. They're focusing that energy in fixing those communities. I agree with you 100 percent, and we've talked about this many, many times in the show that I think that if you wanted to make America a better place, one of the best ways to do it is to make it easier for someone to succeed.

Speaker 2:          01:18:03       Make it easy and, and stop pretending that it's a level playing field. Because I didn't grow up in a level playing field and I got lucky. I got lucky. A lot of people did. And if you go to somewhere like the south side of Chicago and you don't realize that you got lucky, you, you're, you're blind. Yeah, there's, we want them. What's the best way to make America stronger? Less losers. Less people who lose their how did, how has that will give them more of a chance, give them more of an opportunity and give them guidance, ship community centers, clean up the streets, fixed buildings, but that's a lot of fucking money that we're spending right now in Afghanistan and Iraq and missiles and all kinds of crazy shit that we're not putting any money into that. But then who do we hold accountable? We.

Speaker 2:          01:18:44       So for instance, do we like when we talk about the inner cities, for instance, [inaudible], they had been democratically run for ages. Now the local leadership, there's democratic, right? But there's no money there. The problem is there's the money's going somewhere. I me look at Chicago, just not enough. I mean the, the, the money's going into the areas where people are wealthy and that's what they're supporting. They're not supporting these impoverished areas. And then you know what? You're absolutely right. So if that's the case and we all understand that and you know that stop selling this bullshit about gun control there, but let's just tell you, that's just one, one aspect to the next one. Yeah, I agree with you there. So in that sense, in when it comes to gun violence, it's very complex when it comes to gang violence, it's very complex and I agree with you that they need.

Speaker 2:          01:19:29       There's no other way to stop that then to fix the inner cities where people are just in that cycle of constant poverty and crime and that's all they see around them. So it becomes normalized. Yeah, absolutely. So, so now let's talk about mass shootings. Mass shootings, right? So get rid of gun free zones. No one wants to hear that. Get rid of gun free zones. If you're not going to establish a perimeter outside of a building where I can go, don't tell me I can't bring my gun in there. A sign on the window is not stopping somebody from coming into the building. We've seen it time and time and time and time again. If the guns were the problems, we would have mass shooting at every gun show every single day. What we don't. Why the same reason you pointed out why that one, that one place in Georgia when they said everybody had to have a gun, crime went down.

Speaker 2:          01:20:21       People don't want to hear that though. They don't want to hear that. The answer to gun violence is everyone has a gun. Now, not such a convenient answer for a guy like you as very convenient. So many guns can't count. But here, let's look at the alternative. We've been living in it, right? Right. And we know that there's a problem. So why are we entertaining in the fact that maybe that is the case, right? But do you think that like school shootings for example, do you think that these teachers being armed would be the answer? All right, so what do you think there should be armed security on the campus? I say it should be multilayered, right? Because if you, if you really want to put things into perspective and the NRA didn't add about this and people got pissed off, but it's the truth.

Speaker 2:          01:21:06       Wherever whatever school the president's kids go to, they are guarded by guns, right? At school was protected by guns. Right. Anything we hold valuable in this country is protected with guns. No one is more anti gun than Hollywood. When you hear about any sort of crime or gun violence, the left wing people in Hollywood are the most vocal, the most virtue signaling the quickest to jump on their pedestal. Meanwhile, what percentage of their fucking movies involve gun violence? And if you look at the Academy Awards, did you see the security at the Academy Awards? You see all these left leaning liberal actors being protected by people of flak jackets on carrying guns with fingers outside the triggers. I mean dogs, but yeah, it's crazy. You know what it is though. It's a loss of touch with reality. Well, there are also insulated and protected. That's part of it because in their mind their mindset goes like this. Well, I have security guards. I mean, Kim Kardashians, the biggest.

Speaker 2:          01:22:17       I did a video on that, so I did. That was the first thing that came to vegas. What she biggest hypocrite on that, right? Because she's a dumb dumb of course, but she's. She also influences a ton of people. That's unfortunate. But exactly. Steve Harvey hat or on family feud, they were on family feud that Kardashians the whether we're talking about how fucking stupid kid was, but we know this though. That's the crazy thing. There's no incentive for her to be intelligent. There isn't. I mean she's good at making money. Just show. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. And I don't fault her for that. Hey, make you money. But we're. But, but at the end of the day, you still, she still has access to scores of young influential rides. I understand that. That's unfortunate, but there's nothing we can do about that, but other than you point out the fact that she's

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       a dumb dumb. Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not terrible person. I don't think it's been. I don't know. I don't know the one. I just don't know. I've heard her talk. I just don't think she's really interested in expanding your mind. I just don't think that that's something that's not benefits booklets her. Here's the thing though. The mindset though is there are people who we paid to carry guns, right? I don't need to carry them. Therefore you don't either. So what you're saying about her is that she is anti gun, she talks about being anti gun, yet she's constantly surrounded by people who have guns. That's a fact. Absolute fact. So you cancel this fact so then you can't turn around and tell me that. No, you don't need a firearm. Of course you don't pitch seven foot tall dudes strapped to the fucking gills all around you.

Speaker 1:          01:23:54       So it's, it's, it, it, it's, it's man. It's frustrating because it's like, I get it. I would love to have eight dudes standing out here with Ar, 15 slung over their shoulders ready to protect me at have given notice where I could afford it. I pay for it, not do it. The funny thing is I still carry a gun on me because I can't always be exactly where I am. Right. You know what I mean? That's a paranoid way to live though, isn't it? What difference does it make you think about it? How much does it affect me? I wake up everyday, put a gun on my hip and go out and do the exact same thing I would do if I didn't have it. But you don't think about it. So in the. In a sense, you feel like you're not paranoid. I'm not paranoid.

Speaker 1:          01:24:28       No, there's no. No, no, no more paranoid than any than any person that has a fire extinguisher in their house. Think about it. It's a. it's like I don't walk around like, Oh my God, my God, who's, who's coming to get me? That's paranoia. What? What? All I'm doing is being prepared right now. There could be levels of preparedness. You start to get hit diminishing returns. Where starts to be in like it starts to take away from your quality of life, but me putting a gun on my hip and just going about my business that doesn't interfere with my life enough to say, you know what? It's not quite worth it. You know? It's funny what you said about humility and that you like more calm and relaxed since you've been involved with guns. The same thing happens with Jujitsu. Martial arts training in particular, but Jujitsu in particular because you get strangled so much.

Speaker 1:          01:25:12       My neck hurts right now because I was rolling with a guy just before I came up like last week. And um, it, it man, it's such a beautiful sport. It's beautiful, but it also lets you know your place in the food chain, especially when you first start out, you start to realize you really honestly can't call out an elite human until it's too late. What do you mean? So when I started, before I started really kind of getting into mma, so forth and so on, I thought I could spot out the guy you don't want to mess with. Oh, right. You know what I mean? Yeah. And then I went to class and then he knew my coach started pairing me with different people and I'm like, holy crap. Like if I was seeing this dude was just walking down the sidewalk, I'm like, yeah, I can handle him. And now I'm rolled up. The Pretzel was nuts in my face. Narrowed assassins assassins? Yeah man. At Tenth Planet we've

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       got a whole army of him. He would still a computer dorks, no kill you with their legs. Yup. The wrap their legs around your neck and choke you to sleep, but you can't even stop it from happening. That's crazy. Nothing man. And then my. Now I always get stuck and I'm going to overpower him and I'm like, Nah, you better off being week. Believe it or not, the best Jujitsu is weak man's Jujitsu. I always say, if you're going to learn Jiu Jitsu learning from a small guy because you learn from a small guy, they. They've never been able to cheat, meaning they never been able to. I've always had to have perfect technique, techniques, everything. When it comes to Jitsu, literally you have to have some strength for sure and strength with technique is the ultimate but perfect technique is where it's at and you get that from like little guys like Barrett Yoshida, Eddie Bravo, heuler grace of the smaller guys are the ones that you want to learn from because they've never been the big guy.

Speaker 2:          01:26:53       The big guys are like top game guys. Smash past guys. Those guys were just relying on horsepower and leg strength and shit. Those, that's not the way to learn, you know, the way to learn is to go around things. Gotcha. And you know, the funny thing about that is it, do you know why I started doing it? Why someone said would if there took your gun away, Bro? No one said that. I said it to myself. Oh right. So to myself, because I didn't, I almost thought I was over dependent on it because when remember the gun is a tool. She carried a knife too. I used to. She's like that's bitch I used to but I, I float, I float. I'm in this weird space where like, my jeans are kind of sorted a little too tight and not so they're not quite skinny jeans, but it's Kinda like after a certain point I have too much stuff going on in.

Speaker 2:          01:27:36       I got the answer for you. My friend, let's call called a fanny pack. Uh, you know, they're not gonna let me get away with that. Fuck you talking about higher primate.com. You go buy one right now. I'll give you one. Do we have some here? You would. You never wear this. You would never wear this. I'm down to try anything. Come on man. Tactically, tactical wallet. Some of them, but they have ones that are tactical ones. They rip them open. Do you have a tactical and I'm all for it. No, this is just a regular one. So this should keep the shit on you so you don't have your pockets all filled with shit to here's my life. Here's my favorite part. This is what I consider fairly pack. Oh, that's a little big. Yeah, I know. But then again, I'm the guy who carried it, but I'm the guy who runs around with Mac book, Ipad, you know, because I have carried when everywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:28:21       Pretty much if I can pay you back because I'm constantly working. Writing, working? Yeah. What do you. Would you like, what kind of stuff do you write? Script? Pretty much 80 to 90 percent of my show. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh no kidding. Yeah, I, I write all, all the videos I do. I write them. Do you write them in? They put them on a teleprompter or do you practice it? Sometimes it straight off the tops and, and teleprompter. It just depends what we feel is going to give the communicate the best to what you're trying to achieve. Oh, that's cool. Well that's, it shows work ethic for sure. I mean, I don't, I don't have a life, you know, I really don't. All I do is work, work out and eat. So is this, these videos? Is this your tired life now? For the most part, yeah. And in terms of your occupation? So you don't work as a lawyer? Um, I do a little bit. I still have things with a small firm in Houston. Um, and then so other than that, just other investments and things that have gone on, that's about it. So you're able to make a living off of these videos.

Speaker 2:          01:29:15       There was a time when you could do it on youtube anymore? Yeah, it's real recent. Within the last six or seven months. Well actually a gun guy started noticing that drop a long time ago. Like I'm talking about. We went from like to like half. Yeah. And then now it's like 70 percent. So in that happened, that happened like a couple of years ago. And how does that work in terms of like, did they pick certain videos that are just not eligible for monetizations? I would have known before it was just a drop in organic reach. It just started like it wasn't, it wasn't anything formal.

Speaker 2:          01:29:52       At least that's what I picked up on because I started noticing. I'm like, wait a minute. Like, I mean I wasn't living off the youtube stuff, but I was like, this is like, I just kept my income cut in half. It's weird. Yeah. Well there's, there's been some people that have investigated this and there's been some inside sources have told people that they actively target conservatives, gun owners, redneck. They do it on twitter. They do it a lot, a lot of different places. I don't doubt it. I don't know. One hundred percent. Where's that guy? American provider Guy that did those undercover investigative reports. He sent a bunch of people into like bars and talk to twitter engineers. Um, you know what I'm talking about. Yeah. Now I will say this though, there are so like there are certain people in these places that are actually, they may not even agree with my stance, but I've talked to them and they'll help me out the best that they can.

Speaker 2:          01:30:49       You know, some people on facebook, some people youtube so and so on because they're all those individuals, you know, the column column go support is in a sense because you know they can be more explicit about the, you know, yeah. You're not going to have just a complete uniform, left wing ideology at any of these organizations are going to be some people that, but they get stuck in these group think environments like Google or wherever the fuck it is and they can't speak out. Which is unfortunate because I'm like, isn't this country? This country was founded on the idea of having having a release, undercover footage of twitter employees and employees, engineers and employees, admitting that twitter employees view everything you post on their servers, including private sex messages and Dick pics because that's why. That's why I don't send them. I've never seen engineers also admit that twitter analyzes this information to create a virtual profile of you, which they sell to advertisers. James O'keefe has completed the book about the series entitled American provider, my fight for the truth in the era of fake news. Yeah. So this guy has sent a bunch of people to talk to like engineers and I've seen the videos where they're explaining how

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       they a dog a rhythm and how they make it so that these people don't even know that people can't see their, their tweets or give it all the time. People to send it to me all the time like, hey, you know, um, for some reason youtube is forcing me to unfollow you. Like thought I followed you, but then I'm not following you. And I think some of that's paranoia and I do. Some of it is, some of it isn't. Um, but it still begs the question because the numbers don't lie. Right? So like, I know with facebook there was times I was reaching millions of people but just to post. But then that got cut in half. But largely that was due to monetization, that was before facebook was monetizing itself. So they wanted to cotton now there they want you to pay to get access to your audience.

Speaker 1:          01:32:40       You get what I'm saying so that I don't like it, but it isn't, it isn't like some deep secret kind of like, oh, I want to stifle your reach because you believe in it's now there may be some of that going on. Right? So I had, for instance, like I buy ads for my merchandise, sell on facebook, right? Because if I just post a picture of it, my entire artist doesn't see it. Right. And so somebody went through facebook and just deleted all of our ads, like especially toward money on ads and they just delete, disapproved them out of nowhere. And so then I called the contact and then it was like, no, that should've happened. And then it went back and put it back up. So sometimes it's even individualized, you know what I mean? It's just an individual who disagrees with everything you stand for.

Speaker 1:          01:33:22       Who has the power to do it. When you remember when that guy did that with trump is disabled, is twitter really did it for a couple of days? You know, there's definitely people that have that kind of power and they abuse it. I mean, you see that everywhere. You see that with moderators on message boards. You see that with every time people have more power than you and they go, I don't like this fucking guy, this guy talking about his guns. Fuck his ass, and they just yank them. The weird thing is though, like I don't complain about it on my platform at all because no one cares. Yeah. Because I remember the first time youtube started taking off taking like demonetizing my videos for ads. I mentioned it and a lot of people were like, good, I don't like those ads anyway. You do realize I have to pay to get this stuff done.

Speaker 1:          01:34:08       Right. You know? Well no one seems to care until it comes and affects them because they don't realize that essentially what they're doing is they're, they're censoring you by diminishing the amount of money that you can make. Yeah. You know, you could, you could say it's not real censorship, but it is censorship. I mean it's, it's, it's pretty much what I'm dealing with right now. So for instance, right now my videos don't come out as consistently. Like I do good reviews. I'm known for my gun reviews. Right. And I liked my grandmother used to be very cinematic voiceover. I put thought into them. I write scripts out from my videos. The problem is too now before where I could afford to hire someone to edit them, I can't write and I need that now more than ever because now on the political front of the things I'm running around, I'm traveling. That's why I was having my Mac book with me. I have to try to find places where I can try to edit a little bit and get things done. But then the same people who were like, we don't care about

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       the ads on your videos and you make your money from your, from your videos are saint people like why aren't you making videos as much as you used to? Well, I'm like, well, I don't have the money to pay someone to edit the videos in order to keep pumping them out the way I was doing it before and I'm not going to give you some sub quality crap. Right. I could just toss a video together and just throw it out there. It's just too much noise. You can't listen to all those people that are complaining and asking for things, which is true, but I really. I really do think that twitter or youtube rather is fucking up because they're opening up the door to a competitor that is really invested in free speech. I disagree. Really? How so? It's the advertisers. They are at the. They are at the mercy of the advertisers.

Speaker 2:          01:35:37       They are, but I know people over at Youtube, they are deciding what they want said and not Sacha, and this is how I know. I brought up Jordan Peterson, this woman that worked at huge fan of and she said he's a troublemaker, and I said, how is he a troublemaker? She had no answer. She radical left wing but not thoughtful, not, not thoughtful. Like she. She'd just have a good argument for this and when you did, when you pushed back, she's used to being the boss at work. She's used to just dismissing you and when I was pushing back with her like, why? Why is that? Why? Why is he a troublemaker? Like you're telling me what's problematic, but what he says, no answer to that, but yet able to dismissively say someone's a troublemaker when they're a very highly respected intellectual that has amazing points about a lot of different things that resonates with a lot of very, very smart people.

Speaker 2:          01:36:23       I think he's the nature of our time. He's a very bright guy in a, in a really good human. When you meet him, he's a really good person. So for someone just say he's a troublemaker, like okay, no because he doesn't agree with you and he's causing trouble with your organization because you're censoring people's views and viewpoints and it's so convenient to read the label. Someone all right or you know, this is, this is what we're dealing with today. There's these hate identity politics. It drives me insane. It's crazy. It's crazy how many people flocked to it too because it's intellectually easier varies. It's very easy. You can sit there and then you just re just regurgitate all of the talking points that you have. This is why I don't do well on cable news hits because what ends up happening is like on this issue, I intellectualize it, right?

Speaker 2:          01:37:13       Like the conversation we're having now, like I get the benefit. I love this because we could sit here if we need to think about something. You know? That's a good point. Yeah. Let me think about that for a little like on cable news and you can't do that. You can't do that. I just did this kind of platforms, the best platform because the conversation is never interrupted. He never stopped for ads and no one can tell someone to. I'm about to go to the bathroom. Here you go ahead, man. Sorry we could wrap this up soon, but I wanted to. I really wanted to get to other than not having gun free zones. Yeah. I mean not having everyone armed to the teeth and. Well, no. Here's, here's the thing. Here's the thing. I was saying if you're going to have gun free zones, make them real gun gun free zones. Don't just put a sticker on the

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       window and then say you can't bring your gun in here and then not have physical measures in place to prevent it because otherwise I'm allowed to prevent it to have like some movie theater or something. If you have a movie theater, have them. If you're gonna, make it a gun free zone. Have a metal detector and the metal detector goes off. You're still fucking guns in the room. And what are you gonna do you have armed guards to keep people from? So then. So then don't make it a gun free zone. Right? Okay. But even if you don't mean, okay, say if you have a gun free zone and you have a movie theater and you put the metal detectors on, the only way to enforce that is to have guns. Okay? Yeah. But you know what I'm saying? So if you want to hire, if you want to hire, if you want to hire armed guard to stand there, right?

Speaker 1:          01:38:37       With the metal detectors, because of the metal detectors are only as good as the person being able to enforce it. Right. So we need to. We need the executive. Right. So that would be an armed guard. Right? Right. So we think about it though. We do it at the airport. Yes. You know what I'm saying? We do it at certain nightclubs when I go, I'm not admitting to go into strip clubs where I am. When I go to strip club, I get patted down. There's a guard there. There's usually three, three guys there with guns. I mean, and I don't. Besides the people they let in who shouldn't have them anyway, she just. There's always going to be cracks. Right? Right. But at at least if you're going to make it a gun free zone, put up the physical preventative measures to reinforce that. You can't just.

Speaker 1:          01:39:17       A lot of people just don't sticker on the window and say this is a gun free zone. The only people who are going to obey that or the people you're not even worried about anyway. Well, the thing about movie theaters, there's movie theaters don't even say this is a gun free zone. When do they say there's some movie theaters? Is it state to state? So for instance, like in Dallas, right where um, there are some movie theaters where I can bring my gun in. No problem. There are other movie theaters that have these signs that say you're not allowed to carry a gun in here. Right? And so it is state to state. Some states they just require you to put up a sign, like it's business to business to it is, it absolutely is. So from that perspective, it's like, it's like even the courthouse, right when I go to the courthouse courthouse was a gun free zone minus the fact if you were a cop.

Speaker 1:          01:40:00       But what do you have to do when you go to the courthouse? You go through metal detectors. There were cops, there were people there with guns. So what do you do about schools? Same thing, but it's like these guys that are showing up, they're not even, they're not even students to that school. Like Mr Glenn Hug. Think about it like this though it. This is where the argument gets really disingenuous because it's like, oh, we want to save our kids lives in schools. Right, so the inner cities have more violence than we can think of. Right? There's tons of shootings that go on outside of the schools in their cities. Was the last time you heard a mass shooting in the inner city? Very, very rarely. Very rarely. If not ever. What's the one thing that they all have? Metal detectors. Huh? What's the one thing that Parkland didn't have?

Speaker 1:          01:40:48       Metal detectors. What's the one thing that a lot of these suburban schools that get shot up don't have metal detectors? Well, you know, it's one of the things that they've found too, is that it's a very strange sort of situation, but when you deal with places that have a lot of violence, when you deal with places that have gun violence and crime, which you don't have in those places, is the random mass shootings. You have one on one crime, one arm, but the tangible reality of actual gun violence for whatever reason, sort of eliminates these mass shootings. The mass shootings tend to occur in places where people think they're safe. Yeah, right. Like schools, movie theaters. I think there's just, there's a different dynamic involved. You know what I mean? It's um, it's gonna become more of an unknown because if you compare the violence in the inner city to volunteer the suburbs which present themselves and by way of mass shootings, if you compare the numbers as a whole mass shootings account for statistics for about one to two percent of all gun violence, right?

Speaker 1:          01:41:53       And so, but does exceedingly higher number of percentage of gun violence in inner cities. Right? And it all really goes back down to what I said before, it's by the economics. So you have a situation in the suburb, suburban areas where economically speaking, they're good, right? Right. So there's not really an incentive to just engage in random violence. You know, there isn't a narco economy there that that feeds on itself, that requires you to engage in a certain level of violence in order to survive. Whereas on the other hand, in the inner cities, you do have that dynamic. So from that perspective, what ends up happening though, even though there was an money, isn't everything, money doesn't care it all, so you're still gonna have instances of people who slipped through the cracks because money doesn't cure everything and so when it does happen to manifest itself in these random acts of mass shootings, right?

Speaker 1:          01:42:39       Whereas here there isn't. If I know I'm going to school and I'm going to have to deal with, I'm going to have to inevitably deal with the violence outside of the school anyway. It almost, it almost makes it unnecessary to engage in random acts of mass shootings. It's almost, it's almost kind of like this perverted distraction from, from wanting to shoot a place up when you have to deal with violence on an ongoing basis every single day of your life. You know what I mean? I think that's what their point was. The point was that when violence is real and it's around you all the time. Yeah, it's, it doesn't become this attractive. Blow up the game. Why don't you go take a leak and then we'll wrap this up and I'll get back. Cool. I'm young. James is going to show me his collection of guns while you're gone. Carries one in his pants at all times. Strapped right next to his deck. Do you think you'd ever carry a gun? Carry. Oh, like what if like what if someone came in here and got us licensed for concealed carry and said young Jamie, you need to be strapped. All you have to do is fill out this paperwork and I'm going to make it happen, man. I just don't personally feel. I mean, I, I, I feel like it's also naivety or whatever that I don't feel the need

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       to do it. Well, most of the time you wouldn't have the need to do it. Right? Right. The question is, if you were at a place like, you know, fill in the blank, whenever one of these things has gone down a nightclub, let's say that gay nightclub in Orlando, maybe you're curious and you're walking around with the theater. I love about Batman the night it came out. Yeah. How about the Batman one or there wasn't a one, an Amy Schumer movie? There was, yeah, there was a mass shooting, you know, I think it was an amy schumer movie, one of our movies because she became like this big anti-gun advocate afterwards. Um, what do you think that you would ever find yourself in a situation where you'd want a gun? I mean, after that happened, I just, I was, I've gone to movies and pictured it happening and I don't know, you just think about what you would do and I don't know that pulling out a gun and firing back is even in my conscious thoughts.

Speaker 2:          01:44:44       It's definitely in the cards. If the guy has a gun and he's in the room and you see one guy shooting people and you're there and he's not shot you yet, it's definitely in the option. I suppose so, yeah. I mean it depends on how long you're in there too. If it's also whether or not you can keep your shit together while someone shooting, you know. I mean keeping your shit together while while guns are going off and. But that is. That is not a normal thing for you and the amount of adrenaline will be pumping through your body. We're talking about if you were in a situation where a mass shooting was going down, the people that think they can just pull out their gun and shoot that person. You might fucking hit random people. You might hit the wall. You might hit the ceiling.

Speaker 2:          01:45:22       Like, here's the thing about. I'll tell you, I have a lot of experience in archery and one of the things that happens with people when they're shooting a live animals, they panic. A big fucking moose walks in and you, you might hit that moves in the Dick. You might not even, even things as big as a building and you might miss it. Totally. I mean, it happens all the time. Twenty yards away. People missed the entire animal. They're just. And that's something that's not even going to fight back. That's just a Moose for the vegas shooting thing. I any, any, uh, witness reports and anything. It's so hard. I feel like anything, even video reports, there's such a chaotic situation. Sunday night. Everybody's wasted. Yup. So wasted. Yup. What are you going to do? You have no idea? Well, it's also one of those things too, whereas it's real problem with the conspiracy theories because one of the things that happen out of the Vegas situation was people would show up at all these different casinos and say someone's shooting.

Speaker 2:          01:46:17       So they would say were the security. We go, there's an active shooter at circus circus. There's an active shooter. So the conspiracy theories were like, look, they're shooters everywhere. There were shootings everywhere. I know there was people everywhere that were freaking out because this fucking guy was just gunning people down from a hotel room when they haven't learned about being a lawyer. Eye witness testimony is not reliable. Eye witness testimony is dog shit, man. I've had people tell me about situations where I was there. I was there. I'm like, dude, that is not what fucking happened, and then you have to go over it with them and they're like, oh yeah, maybe you're right. I will. This though. People stopping mass shootings with firearms happens more than people realize it does happen, but it's just what happens is it's very disingenuous to deny it happens.

Speaker 2:          01:47:00       There's a lot of stories out there where it's happened and people don't know about it because they're not. They're not going to push it. So you think the elimination of gun free zones would be the way to protect people? I say, no, I'm going to clear it. I'm. I'm cleaned up a little bit. If you're going to have a gun free zone, have physical preventative measures in order to enrich, to enforce it. If you're not going to do that, eliminate them. I think they're. I think first and foremost, this will be the first thing that we should do. There should be some sort of a public hearing on the use of Ssri antidepressants, psych medications and their corresponding instances like the, the, the, the amount of instances where these shooters are on these things. I don't think people are aware. I'll say this much. To piggyback off what you're saying, if I was diagnosed with a mental disorder, I first thing I would do is I would go to a bookstore or go online and figure out every possible way that I can tell, help my way through it because I won't touch the stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:48:01       Well. One of the things that's just as effective if not more effective. I think Google this cardio, I think exercise and running is more effective to treat depression than ssrs. I am almost certain that's that, that that's the case. I don't doubt it at all. I mean, I think or you think so many people are addicted to marathons? Yeah. Oh, believe me, I wanted to get high. Yeah. There's something to it, man. I get high when I run for sure. Is there anything in there? Every time I go to the official site that says it's not a real thing whose blood official sense? CBI Dot. Where's the NCBI? The like where they did a study on it. Is exercise a viable treatment for depression or they want to say no, get pilled up, but there. There are studies that have been done that show because I know Rhonda, Patrick was discussing it.

Speaker 2:          01:48:48       I have to be freaking. I hate taking medicine like I have to be on the floor before take prescribing exercise before medication. A real big activity is shown to be effective treatment for many forms of depression. So why are so many people still on antidepressants? Well, here's one reason, and this is not to dismiss the people that are depressed because I know people that are depressed and it's a horrible thing and I know people that have been helped by antidepressants. I know people that have my good friend Ray. He was suicidal. He got on antidepressants. He's happiest. Fuck. Now he's off of them. It helped him. My friend Brian, it was the same thing, not the Brian that we know another Brian, he was a Jujitsu guy that I knew. He had a real fucking problem, got on Ssri, turned his life around, found a good woman, got got an a great relationship. It started his own business, weaned himself off of him. Now he's happy. There's sometimes people find ruts in their life. We had a podcast with a guy wrote a book on it, a Guy Johann Hari, who wrote a book on depression, Ssri for depression,

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       heart failure patients not so fast. This study should put to rest the practice of starting ssrs and depressed patients with heart failure in an attempt to affect cvd outcomes would a cvd. Cardiovascular disease. Oh, okay. Oh, well that's with people with heart problems typically, but it's also a depression. People with depression and heart failure. Yeah. Fucking exercise I think is is not. It's a requirement of the human body. I really agree with that. Something even my darkest times, so I'm never at my. I'm more. I'm never more at my best. Then actually when I'm down, when I'm going through things because. Because my, my response to it is what it is to tighten up. It forces you to folk. Exactly. Yeah. And so one of those things that I do is like, I've been to the gym everyday for the last two weeks, right? Um, it forces me to one of those things that happened that one of the things that happens is I start working out more because of the clarity of mind I get after the fact, right. And then the sense of accomplishment and then it Kinda starts me off in a way where it's like, okay, now what's next? It's like I'm chasing, I'm chasing the next thing to conquer. Um, but. But yeah, I, I agree with you wholeheartedly. I think. I think focusing on focusing on means outside of just prescribing pills, right? I don't like taking pills. I don't like things that alter my mind. I don't, I don't like it. Maybe because I'm a control freak in that sense. I'm the guy with 100 guns is a control freak.

Speaker 1:          01:51:23       I have something to say about. It was just thinking about. I had thought while I was using your super toilet, crazy toilet, right? You gotta take a shit. That's the where to go. Um, I was thinking, I was like, man, yeah, I should get Joe Rogan, one of my guns. And then I realized you can't even notice it here. I can't. Nope. What can I own? What do you have that I can own? A was the first gun I ever. The first couldn't. I've done. So this one just so happens to be one that you can see. You have a company that makes him. Is that what it is? Yeah, I have. Um, what I did was I came out with a signature series, a line of handguns. Well, the first one because it's not allowed to California. What's, what's wrong with it? Um, y'all have a list of guns that you're allowed to own it.

Speaker 1:          01:52:05       It's not on. And then like you would have to. There's this micro stamping that's required for any gun that's not on the list and it's so prohibitive. Yeah, it's weird. So what is different, what kind of guns are they? What is the other? Prohibited the one that you have that I can have. Oh, I can have him pull it up. Sorry if you want. You mean that particular gun? What's about it? Like what is this Spec state? Just it just. It just is like it's just a list of guns. I don't really know exactly the caliber, the semiautomatic capabilities because there some automatic guns on the list that you're allowed to own. There are other. It was just arbitrary. That's what it seemed like to me. What kind of gun is it, Jamie? He'll look it up.

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       If you want to pull it up. A full up tiered of t y r e d e f e n s e t or defense.com. Here we go. Dump, dump, dump, dump. Yeah. There's some weird shit. I mean we've got Jerry Brown's, our fucking governor. That goofball. Let's see. Firearms transfers, work order, phone gallery contact with tier one, tier one. It'd be t, t y r e t y r a. There we go. Bam. Tyree,

Speaker 2:          01:53:31       you haven't certainly today coming up that people are paying attention to. Usually it comes up when I'm typing this stuff, so this is why people can't shoot Benton Lincoln mass shooting. Going on pressure. Actually, no. You see one where it says the advocate. Yeah, that's it. Alright. What's the name of the gun? Is the advocate someone might've been no service unavailable. Oh, the hackers. They got to it already. It's the fucking Russians, Bro. Cassie problems. Go back and get a pass. City problems. I don't know if everyone we've already killed it. Killed it. He kind of take a couple hundred people at it by the, by the time that it hits youtube though, isn't it a blender to latest seconds. Twenty seconds to type in, type in the advocate and then calling on the war and then see what that does. And in like erase tier defense though.

Speaker 3:          01:54:22       Here we go.

Speaker 2:          01:54:23       Um, click on the top 10. We killed that website. Go to images. Killed that website. That's the gun. Okay. And why? That seems like a normal handgun. It is. So what the fuck is wrong with it? Why can't I have it? I know. I want to ask the folks that make leaders in California, but what are they saying is wrong with it? Like specifically, I don't know why they make the decisions they make in California to be honest with what. What is the specs of this gun? What it is a nine millimeter handgun, semiautomatic. Is it because it's semiautomatic or. No? No, I don't think so. No, no, just I don't. I don't think that's the basis. Like I don't. I don't know the, the complete basis and reasons for why certain guns are allowed. Handgun wines of California and others. I'm pretty sure they're going to be tons of people who tell me this because I have a huge audience in California.

Speaker 2:          01:55:12       I think it's actually my, one of my biggest audience, there's a lot of gun owners in California. People people aren't, you know the idea that guns in California or somehow or another rare you want. The funny thing is the birthplace of they are 15, wasn't California now? Well that's a weird gun. It's a gun that people just have demonized. It's not the most powerful gun. It's not the scariest gun nut but military. But they don't even use it in the military. They don't use it in the military. But to be honest with you, if they did, I'd want that gun.

Speaker 3:          01:55:43       Why?

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       Because it's the most effective means to protect myself, right? Like I don't. I don't understand this idea of neutering guns to the point where I'm too new to and get to the point of irrelevance or ineffectiveness. It's people that don't use guns that have this idea, and this is. This is where we're at now. I think one of the things that I'm getting out of this conversation with you is that there's not really a clean answer. There's not a clean answer. And if there was, people would have figured it out. It's almost like society has to continue to evolve and one of the ways society evolves is having these conversations. You and I having this conversation where a few million people are going to listen to it and then millions of people on their own having conversations and people looking at the reality and that's in that way.

Speaker 2:          01:56:26       I think what you're doing is important and what a lot of people are doing is important where they're talking about the actual numbers and the actual statistics and letting us get a look at it, and that's the one thing that I try to convey with my videos. I don't care where you stand on the issue. I just will have a shit ton of more respect for your position if it's from a position of education, if you actually have some knowledge. I'm not saying you have to be a Jedi. Master firearms. Just understand the very basics, the fundamentals. We have politicians pushing policy based on things that make no sense like it. It actually exposes the fact that they don't know anything about firearms and so it was like you're going to push policy on something that you don't know anything about and so it. It's disingenuous and an inherently dishonest, so that's the biggest frustration I have.

Speaker 2:          01:57:17       I might look it up. I'm going to educate you and give you the information that you need so that you can make an informed opinion about it. If at the end of the day I take you shooting, I tell you the stats I tell you about how guns functioned and how they work. If you still are anti-gun, I can respect that now. That doesn't mean you get to then push your anti gun agenda onto me and limit my rights because of it, but I can respect that. At least we can walk away and say, hey look, well I think we probably got it from a different perspective. I appreciate that and I think we're also faced with the reality of this. The sheer number of guns that we have in this country. It's a staggering number, so you're not going to just take those away. What are you going to put them?

Speaker 2:          01:57:54       And that's just now there's some people were like, well, we can devolve the number over time, right? We can just put these laws and they can get bad for a little bit, but then overtime doing that weird voice. When you do wear all the time, just anti gun, would you be interested in sitting down like maybe on this show if I had an antique gun advocate? I beg for it. Okay. Not, not to say not, not reasonable. Here's the thing. I'm not trying to get up here in and crush this person and, and all that stuff. I've done that to death. Right. But I do want to have the conversation, right. You and I've done it on my show. The only problem is, is it's too easy to ignore it because of the platform that you had someone on your show that made reasonable points, like if somebody wanted to watch you with, uh, in some sort of a debate with an gun person, is there a show that you could recommend that people would go watch right now?

Speaker 2:          01:58:47       That was on? Yes. On your show. On my show. A. We'll see. Here's the thing though. So the, one of the biggest flaws of the people that were on my show that we had that conversation with is you could instantly see it was more of an education process because you could tell they didn't know much. So what would happen is that they make a point about why they believe this. Then I would give them information and then it'd be like, oh, okay, okay. You see what I'm saying? I'm sure there's someone out there that is educated and in kids anti-gun. We'll, we'll have someone find them. Well, I have this. I have a publicist will have him love Matt stags on. Please let me know because I'd be all for it. Yeah, I really would. There's probably someone out there that's reasonable that has good points and has a well thought out sound argument.

Speaker 2:          01:59:35       It would be interesting to listen to you talk to that person. Absolutely. But I think one of the things we can take away from this is that this is a, it's a messy situation. It's not clean. It's not like, hey, we're putting poison in the water, stopped putting poison in the water, clean up the water. It is not that simple. It's not super complicated. Uh, deals with mental health. It deals with freedom and it deals with law abiding. People aren't doing anything wrong where people are trying to take away their rights. They're enthusiasts. They love guns. And I don't think there's any like, look, here's a perfect example. You are sitting here with a gun on your shirt. What kind of gun is at ar? 15. You have an ar 15. Actually selfies I have. I have an archery shirt on. I could walk anywhere with this.

Speaker 2:          02:00:20       No one would feel threatened. No, I'll kill the fuck out of you. Right? But no one would feel threatened. But if you walk around with that, people will, you know, you are one of those gun guy. Are you telling people you have that on you? Is that what you're saying? You warning people. You're a dangerous person, you know? Oh, you're an archery enthusiasts. Oh, so I did archery at camp. When I was in the boy scouts, we shot bows. I'm going to start opening girls at the bar with that. Yeah, I shoot archery. A bad movie, man. It's not a bad move. So listen, I appreciate the conversation. I don't think we got anywhere, but I don't think you can. I think we talked about it. I mean, to be honest with you, it's a conversation that needs. So here's what happens. Things happen in our, in our reality that forced a specific focus on the part of the conversation.

Speaker 2:          02:01:07       Right? And so, um, of course we weren't going to say, I don't know how long we been here, how long we've been. Two hours, two hours, right? We've been having this gun debate for how long now in this country for years. Um, but I think for a lot of people, especially the people who follow me, they wanted me to come on your show, not because you and I were going to come to an answer, but to educate, right? Well also to have what we have on the show where I try to have on the show just discussions, just talk. Exactly. And let people talk. Let people express themselves. And I think you definitely did that today. You Express yourself, you're very reasonable guy. Anybody looks at you and says you're a maniacal gun nut. You pulling that out of your own head, you know, um, but I would love to do that and we'll try to find somebody will try to find somebody if you're open to that. Absolutely. Trying to find somebody that could, could argue the point, but thank you brother. Thanks for having. Great pleasure. All right folks. We'll be back very shortly. We have a second round two today with Sam Harris and Majid Nawaz. See you soon. That was great. That was fun.
