Speaker 1:          01:56          Hello. Do you mind? We love you too, man. Thank you. He came in and just dropped a bomb right there. He's the greatest. Joey Diaz. The greatest. What we need is a food emancipation proclamation. We need a food emancipation proclamation to free the food system from the enslavement of bureaucratic orthodoxy so that consenting adults, and I'm choosing my words very carefully here so that consenting adults could make a voluntary choice of food choice, the type that they want from the source that they want. And if we allowed however many in our society, 5% 10% 20% whoever didn't come, whoever wanted to opt out of government sanctioned orthodoxy and say, hmm, is there something better out here? Can I choose something different? If anybody who wanted to opt out of the of the current industrial government orthodoxy could do so, voluntary consenting adults here, you know we're talking about the right of private contract.

Speaker 1:          03:16          If I want to, if I want to come to your farm voluntarily, no extortion here, okay, voluntarily look around, smell around, ask around and I want what you're producing. I should be able to get it. When the government gets between my lips and my throat, I call that an invasion of privacy. And yes, I do also believe that we should legalize all drugs, all of them. Because the government that can tell you you can't smoke dope can also tell you you can't drink raw milk or, or, or, or refuse to vaccinate your children or you know, go down the line. The fact is that the orthodoxy is so convoluted now that it's perfectly safe and fine to feed your kids. Coca Cola, mountain dew count Chocula cheerios and pop tarts, but not homemade charcuterie, pickles, raw milk and backyard butcher chickens. Not Crazy. It's absolutely crazy.

Speaker 1:          04:19          And if we would free up, I mean I travel a lot. I talked to thousands and thousands of farmers. I just talked to 200 farmers up in San Jose this weekend. You know, and what's the limiting factor? Why is local food cheap? Why is our kind of food, I mean cheap, more expensive, uh, that it has to be. Why are we perceived as elitist? Why isn't it more available? Why is it so hard to find integrity food? This is the issue. And if we would free up those of us in the system that are ready to access our neighbors with quiche and noodles and charcuterie and you know a name, your name, it to free us up, it would, it would completely invert the entire food system in a year.

Speaker 2:          05:10          That's what's weird about like bill o'reilly or the Big Bang theory or any of those shows, is they have this perfect opportunity at any moment to blow people's minds by just making 180 degree turn just turning in some complete opposite direction. Imagine if bill had me direct an episode of Big Bang theory with no notes. Yes, there's going to be a lot of active, but you'd have to write it to you couldn't know I can I, if I, if I have creative liberties with the script, yes, I can get as many gay teens is. I want God, that'd be so fun. That'd be so fun. If like they had to do that at once a year. They had to let underground artists edit and direct their shows just to see what it would turn into. Why that would be a terrible idea. Be Fun. Yeah, it'd be fun for you, but just low stakes shows, sitcoms, you know it's not low stakes because imagine if it was your show and then some fucking dj doug pound comes along and he's like, I'd like to direct your show for a week and be like, fuck you man.

Speaker 2:          06:07          We're going to kill your whole cast. No, you're not man. No. Who wants to watch that shit? Listen man, trust me. Seven 18 it's going to be awesome. They wake up and it's all a dream though. That's the, that's the caveat. Blossom becomes a demon. They all start eating babies. Baby Salad every day, but we'll just use like rubber baby dolls. Don't worry. But if bill o'reilly came out for one show in drag and just it's like this is who I am now. It doesn't really explain it. Same Guy and he's the same guy. It's just like, this is who I am. This is how I've changed deal with it. That would be as big as Geeth. I'd be as big as Jesus. That is how Jesus will come back. It will be below right now. Wilamena we'll Amena o'reilly and he starts slowly beginning of a transformation to the female gender.

Speaker 2:          06:53          Yeah. Yeah. That would be incredibly, it just tells you like the reason why he was like that. It's just she was scared, scared all the time that people find out that he identifies with being a woman and that's where all the hate came from, the homophobia, all the Jesus' love, all that craziness that was, he was into. It was really just, I wanted to be a woman and then he just starts putting pictures of his news, surgical crusty below or ile pussy up on it and people just, it causes waves of suicide. But here's what's crazy. People still spot him out at night, like dress like a man and he looks perfectly normal and they realize it's just a fucking scam. Like everything else he does. He's not really becoming a woman. It's just a bullshit artist. That would be one of the salvage. No, it's what happens is you realize someone's blackmailing him.

Speaker 2:          07:39          You realize somebody has something worse than that and they're like, listen, bill, that's like a house of cards move. Here's what I want you to do on your show. What do you think? Oh my God. You know, I've got these pictures of you fisting chimpanzees, chimps, water. I was doing it for Jesus. So it goes in and tide goes out. You don't know why it fits chimps who could explain it? God moves in mysterious ways while their fist and I to wear a dress. You fucking Cock sucker. I'm not wanting to go out. That's my deal, my personal life.

Speaker 6:          08:21          Eh?
