Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello

Speaker 2:          00:01          Freak bitches. Because I think the ability to communicate and open debate is why we've advanced to the point we're at in the first place. The suppressing of that is almost always someone who has a bad idea and they're trying to shelter. So when you see people that are chasing after someone because they're trying to communicate about something like you were just doing it super d respectfully, what, when when you see that what you have is a bunch of people that are trying to defend a bad idea and defend it with aggression,

Speaker 3:          00:31          you're right. And, and, but if the more you kind of become a mirror image of whatever, whatever they're projecting, you reinforce them in their position as well as from doing other stories about extreme religious beliefs like the Westboro Baptist church. I know from people who I met who were in the church when I made my documentary and then subsequently left that, uh, what short circuits their beliefs, what allows them to see something bigger than what they're in is when you treat them with kindness and instead of shouting back at them or hurling abuse back, which just reinforces their view of you as an enemy of God or suppressive or however they characterize it, if you actually behave decently and attempt to robustly present your position but in a respectful way and with a kind of coming from a place of caring and empathy as opposed to, um, so since soria so hostile attitude that actually, um, it can be a much more effective. Absolutely knows what it's being humane.

Speaker 1:          01:32          I saw this pregnant woman on the l train in New York, but she was one season. One of those was she didn't, she just looked like her stomach was bigger. It, nothing else affect like perfect makeup, just dressed nice in a nice dress. She didn't have a wedding ring on. I wanted to, I just wanted to ask her if everything was okay. If she was with the dope, like she was so beautiful at cab looking at it. I know she felt me looking at it. I probably waited her out. She was so beautiful. I started picturing myself arguing with the real thing. Father, five years from now,

Speaker 4:          02:16          Huh?

Speaker 1:          02:17          I started pitching myself on the train.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Holding hands are there. I started pitching myself five years from now at the yelling at this dude outside the house in Jersey. Hey Dude, you had your chance. Yeah. You like your county uses a sperm donor. You're looking at her beautiful real. Dot. I'm the real dad. You calculating the potential for future joy, being with that person with perfect bone structure, you will let me to take a chance and put your whole life into it. How was this the errands? Just like, oh my God, look at it was you okay? Huh? Hey Baby. You okay? That's what I was saying. Okay. Who He'd say I'm her here. Go. If I'm looking down, I'm just shaking my head. I'm just like, every now and then I just go like this one hands. You want to try it? Oh, come on. The train. Hey, it good though, Dude. I know, I look good. See, this is the thing, I wouldn't even if you go ahead and me on a train, on a train, if I don't have anything organic, I was, I, something crazy happened. Oh Dude, I'm not asking for real life. This isn't law and order. I know. This is like, come on. All right. Okay. I'm the girl ready to go.

Speaker 5:          03:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Sorry. I just accidentally put my face in your pussy. Oh, who's baby is that in there? Cause he in the baby's life. Do you put your long life? Hi, I'm financially stable. Not quite a Mosley, but I'm getting there. And on that note, ladies and gentlemen, this podcast is a wrap. Yet I've got family members, uh, and again, this is not my family of my wife or kids, but the family that I was born into that have never apologized about anything because they come from a cultural landscape where to apologize to your child, to somebody younger is to lose face. A parent is always right. And, I mean, that might work when you're too, but when you're both now adults, I think you could sort of have to get out of that and realize that we all make mistakes and we all have to own up to them.

Speaker 1:          04:22          We all have to apologize honestly, when we make a mistake. And yet some people it's super unhealthy and it's unhealthy for the person who doesn't admit they make the mistake too. Because then it puts you in this position of being in denial of what you know to be the truth, right? You're going to run around pretending that you were right all along when you know in your head that you weren't wrong. So it diminishes your own personal opinions about yourself. Right? I'm sorry you're not sorry. Ready on, on this exact point. Okay. So I'm having a chat with a family member, an older family member of my, for my family as the problem person. This is, this is one of the key problem for people in my family. And, uh, he said something to the effect of, Oh, you know, those ancient Greeks, uh, those Christians were really, uh, antisemetic where I come up with the exact details.

Speaker 1:          05:08          I said, oh, well, you know, I'm, I'm sorry, I don't mean to correct you, but, uh, those ancient Greeks were not Christian. As a matter of fact, the way we mark that, as we say, bce, before common era or BC before Christ. So by definition, those guys were marked as not being Christian. So when he's now faced with sort of historical evidence that suggests that he was wrong. What'd you think? He does it? It's so grotesque that I'm not even sure you can guess what he did. I don't want to guess. So he basically says no, that's right. That's what I said. I said that they weren't Christian. You said that they were Christian, so he looks at you in the face. That's, that's called, if, if you'd allow me saying on air, that's mind fucking right. Yeah. He looks at you in the face. He knows that, you know, but he has enough in Arabic. You say what? Huh? It's the, it's this kind of pathological pride. Right.

Speaker 3:          05:58          Fuck you right. I'm going to look at you. Right. So rather than saying, Oh gee, I didn't know that. Thanks for correcting me. He flips what our original points of this agreements was there. You can talk to that dude. You've got to cut that guy loose. Well, maybe I have, oh, maybe you have, I like how you said that. Long story short for listeners, uh, Joe was kind enough to, I was interviewing Sam Harris for my podcast and Sam was like, we really should just do more than just a one on one because ordinarily my podcast is about as a panel of people, a bunch of people sitting around and talking about the news. And so I texted Joe and I was like, is there any chance of doing it at your studio? And being the gentleman that he is, he was like, sure, just come on by and we'll just type it, even though he had to show his yesterday.

Speaker 3:          06:41          So after those shows, late at night, Sam Harris comes over and Hannibal buress is still here. So send me, it was about to call an uber and I said, why don't you stick around? Yeah, we were drunk. We drink so much whiskey. The best decision you ever made, inviting him to stay. So Hannibal buress and Sam Harris and Joe Rogan and I have an interesting episode of my podcast, which will come up. So if you're listening to this now or watching this now, subscribe to a way that people live. Just switch for we the people space live. You need the live and then when it drops you will, you will see it. It was dining epic, our long argument between Hannibal Burr a drunk Hannibal burress and Sam Harris regarding a statistics. We'll just leave it at that. Yeah, you don't want to give him more statistics that may or may not involve black lives matter and police shootings, police shootings, and just the reality of police violence versus the perceived reality of police violence.

Speaker 3:          07:41          So arguing about the statistics rather than the emotional. That's right. Connection and the difference. And I mean what was interesting is how we have conversations about things that are so touchy, right? I mean, part of the reason why I want to talk to Sam and you on my podcast is because I think it's important for us to find ways to have the sorts of conversations that you have in that Sam has and that hopefully I have where there's not a lot of, uh, kind of opinionated bloviating it's more about actually trying to understand each other, actually trying to take each other at face value, not sticking, you know, what a sword in the sand and saying like, I can't believe that you offended me. Or you know, having tripwires that if someone transgressed as that or says a certain thing, then all of a sudden you're going to crank up the outrage machine.

Speaker 3:          08:22          So much of that, so much of that. So I wanted to talk to Sam and knew about what, how do we have conversations that are, that are more reasonable. But of course you don't necessarily have a conversation that reasonable when you're drunk and emotionally sensitive. A drunk Hannibal burress and says that he's smarter than Sam Harris and smarter than I think anyone. Didn't he say anyone? Ah, he debates that he was smarter than Sam Harris. I mean, Annabelle's a smart guy. He must be successful and he's, he's a compelling and good comic. Just not smart enough to know that he shouldn't say smart Sam Harris.

Speaker 3:          08:56          He was drunk, really drunk, and we kept drinking too. You hit it. Well, you hold it like, well, I bounced back quick. I'm healthy. Yeah. So I stopped drinking also. So what you're implying exactly what I said. You heard me and, uh, about an hour before the end of our potty of me and Hannibal, I realize I was drunk. So I backed off and he didn't play out that he was pouring himself. Huh? How like half a half a wine glass of whiskey? Yup. Yup. Yeah, it was deep. We went deep. So, uh, he can't be held responsible folks.

Speaker 6:          09:39          Okay.
