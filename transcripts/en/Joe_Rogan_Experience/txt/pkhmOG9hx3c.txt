Speaker 1:          00:00:05       We might be too hard to talk pretty high. This is a bad way to start a podcast, but yet we do it this way. Every time you guys talk about that stuff, sometimes it takes about 15 minutes to recover. Like once, once the first wave hits you, you know what she wants from this wall. And that explained that commercial. It's kind of explains, yeah, explains why they ramble. Uh, this, this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you as always by ANA [inaudible] dot com. I'll just leave this brief.

And, uh, we're big fans of Ting Ting became uh, one of the few podcast sponsors that we have.

Speaker 2:          00:01:21       You know what somebody did somebody, you know what I was joking around when

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       day about suck my cock fatty.com somebody took that and registered it and made a mirror of my website. So now if you go to suck my cock fatty.com it's my website, which is hilarious, but all that could have been done through hover, hover a offers a lot of a cool software to use and they offer a lot of cool things that are free like a who is privacy protection, um, sub domains, a URL forwarding, all that stuff that should be included with the domain name management. They include that for, it's all that's all free. And uh, I think that's just indicative of how they are with Ting and just how they are period.

Speaker 3:          00:03:34       Wilson experience try by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. It's not official

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       until the music starts that who did that song? Brian did it. Oh, I'm sorry. That garage band. This is a fucking master. He's a garage band master. It sucks because I hear it all the time and like stupid TV shows and commercials now. Like, like, like one of the rifts in that song. Oh really? Yeah. And it's like, ah, it's what the cause it's a garage band riff. Yeah. Like there's parts of it that are just straight up from garage band. I tweak that a little bit. Yoshi male, our friend Yoshi is here. Hey Joe, what's up? Yosh and brought his friend David Cho, who insists on relentless asleep. Relentlessly torturing Yoshi about, uh, it's pretty fucking good at it. His nickname, this is a strange nickname, Yoshi. Yoshi male? Yes. Why? Why would that, why would they call you that? Is there a story to go with this? Well, for people who do know Yoshi, they know that he used to work in the porn business and his currency was porn. Like if, if you needed to get tickets to something, like Yoshi knows a lot of athletes and, and a rock stars and whatever, and he's like, hey, you guys want some porn? He's just, he's always there with the box of porn. And if you've gotten a box of porn from Yoshi, you know that sometimes he hide some.

Speaker 3:          00:05:03       That's true. Do you hide it in there? Is it like

Speaker 2:          00:05:05       your way of just like letting people get Ahold of it? So like, people who wouldn't ordinarily watch it, we're like, well, fuck it. I got the DVD. No one's here but me. Let's just throw this on right now. What are you trying to do? I'm trying to figure out what they're into. And uh, he likes, you know, he likes it. He likes to make people uncomfortable. No, but you know what? Sometimes even when they're angry, I could tell it's a fake ingredient. They really liked it. Ooh, really? It'd be interesting to, if you could have a cap camera set up to see how long they watched it before they turned it off. You know, they're like, this is disgusting. Get the lube out. And there's still did a study a while back where they took men who are homophobic and they showed them, uh, image, heard about this, guys having sex and they showed arousal.

Speaker 2:          00:05:48       Oh, I'm really the opposite. I heard that they got, uh, like, like if a flight or fight response, like they get really like aggressive and angry. Really? Yeah. What I read was that it was penile arousal was the word that they, there was a, uh, a recognized arousal in the males that were especially homophobic, like especially angry about gay people as much more common for them to actually like Yoshi fighting off gay thoughts like Yoshi gets aroused. Thinking about a straight male watching. What did that come from? Oh, by the way, don't believe everything you says. All right. You told me if I'm laying there. So I, so Yoshi,

Speaker 4:          00:06:30       you know, like everyone in here watches porn, you watch, you jerk off to it. But this, this was this guy's life. So what, what gets this guy hard? A guy who like a nine to five job watches porn from morning till night, right? Just asses Dicks, penises and pussy just smashing together, like over and over, over again. And a lot of the times when I used to call him, I'm like, Hey, Yo, you want to go get dinner or something? He'd be like, no, I gotta finish the tranny porn. And it was a, I always thought it was like he was just fucking with me. Right. But then he's like, it's not this like niche thing. It's like huge. It's our number one seller. And it always has been. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, wow. That's what I said. Okay. This is something that people weren't, they love this shit. Black trainee porn. It's the hottest thing. Oh wait, is this like any huge, the biggest underground and it's huge. And untalked about, that's crazy. The number one seller. Even when I work at the retail sale or in Seattle, um, we have booth and at the end of the month we do Talia, which movies sold the most? Top 10. It's always combination gay or trainings. Whoa, that's fucking crazy. Female. Is there, um, a lack of that? Well, there's not a lack of that stuff on the Internet. It's not like they would have to purchase it. Like why are they purchasing that more than anything else? Is that what the demand is? The Ma did. It's like a man is Madison ever trainee love and dudes are there. What do you think

Speaker 4:          00:07:57       it is? Because this is what I think it is. It's so easy,

Speaker 2:          00:08:02       by the way. I did. It's really shocked me that we started that whole podcast with training sites. Oh, it's shocking to you. All right, go ahead. Why not? Why is it shocking to me, Yoshi male? Not Though we've been talking about, you know, let's talk about, you were talking about you don't worry about it. Alright. So what is your, my thing is, it's just,

Speaker 4:          00:08:20       you know, if you think of the things that we used to have to jack off to, you know, we're a bit older, like the Sears catalog and it was just, you know, if there was someone at your school that had got a blowjob, like they were like the hero, you know, it's like, like now like eight year old kids are giving each other blowjobs it's just talking about Jim Norton. All right, go ahead. No, I'm, I'm like, Yo, she's a grown up adult male that watches porn all day. But think about like a regular kid who just discovered the internet and his first boner. Like he can already watch anal and everything. So I think, I think you do anal,

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       you get blowjobs, you have sex with your girlfriend and you're like 16 and you've already seen and done everything. You're like, what's the next thing? You know? That's what I think. I Dunno, I might be wrong on that, but you know, once,

Speaker 3:          00:09:08       okay,

Speaker 5:          00:09:08       I dunno, you're in that business. What do you think? Why do you think it's such a huge thing? I have a friend in Boston, professor of evolutionary biology, but he, he did like a research, like full, very popular body parts and internet search. This is according to 100 million research, um, obvious one, tit ass feet and penis according to 100 million research by men. And according to my friend it, it's because we're interested in all the different sexual cues. It's doesn't make you a gay person. I think it's part of our competitiveness like guides, urinating, bathroom, kind of look over the guy's penis. You know, it's not a gay thing, I don't think.

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       Well, the, I think part of the idea is also that a lot of people have these sexual thoughts about men because they were imprinted with some sort of sexual experience by a man when they were young, whether it was molestation or something like that. Whatever it is, they had some weirdness that happened with another boy. And because of that they have, even though they don't have homosexual thoughts, they're not homosexual. They stay can still get aroused by the idea of men or by the idea of doing something you're not supposed to do. Looking at a guy's cock. If you fucking shemale is that gay? Yes. Check this one out. Charities not as gay jerk off to it. Is that gay? Check this out. Uh, no, no, no, but it's questionable. What does that, what do you show him?

Speaker 6:          00:10:33       Avn. There was a ton of these guys or they look like a normal guy, but they had the nicest tits in the whole entire world. And so like they would pull up their tits up for girls. They could just suck on them. It looks like it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:44       God, the totally looks like, yeah. Can that looks like like a, like an older actor guy. Like a regular looking dude with huge titties. Yeah. So,

Speaker 6:          00:10:53       but they were everywhere. It just normal looking blogging here. Kevin Mcdermott. It's like Dylan Mcdermott with giant tits. That was amazing. Kathy's been naming. What is that? Is that a new look? Yeah. There's another one like Danny, I forget his name is. Uh, do you know who I'm talking about? Yoshi? He's a short blond hair. I don't remember the last day. And he's something, he was another one. Short blonde hair. Oh, that reminds me. Do you? I got you a present when I was in navy and I brought it for you. It's, it kind of fits this conversation to you, son of a bitch. What did have, you can frame it maybe hanging out,

Speaker 3:          00:11:31       scared, openness. It's, what is this?

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       It's dudes with the hard Dick's in their pants. Oh, let me see if you think you're funny. Is that what it supposed to be? Funny or underwear? Why you paid money for this? You really wanted that. This is one of those things.

Speaker 6:          00:11:48       Oh, well, if you don't want it, I'll take it. I bought it for you drunk the next day.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       I was like, why did I buy this roadshow is silly bitch. That was why, but it's good artwork. He was aroused by it. Yeah. He was around, I guess he was. I got a little tingle right in. They're looking at, if you're not, he really wanted it for himself, but while he was purchasing, he's like, this is from my friend Joe, so it takes the gayness away from him. Yeah. If you're gay and you saw that, you'd be psyched. Yeah. That's how I thought it was funny. I thought it was like that gangster fag shit back in the day. Got Joe will think this is hilarious. Do you remember that there was a wrap

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       burned named Gangsta fag and he had like, uh, all these uh, Gangsta rap songs about having sex with dude.

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       This shit's huge too. Yeah. In New York. Have you seen it? Like, no, like homo now? Yeah. Like it's like super hardcore gangsters, but then they like look like gangsters, but they like wear pink and I forgot what the movement is called, but it's in, you see it a lot in New York. Wow. It's like they're on the subway just like making out and they're like, what the fuck you looking at? And they're like, Holy Shit. Gangster gay people. I like it. I'm into it. Yeah. We need another wrinkle in this society. There it is. Yeah. What we're looking at for the folks listening on Itunes, this is two,

Speaker 1:          00:13:07       it's a famous photo of to look, they'd look Latino gentlemen was tape Fletcher and gang tattoos and they're in the tub together. Naked. No, no biggie. Just totally not gay, just alive today. Apparently that's in the Latino community. In prison. It's a big thing. It's gay for the stay for this day that a lot of dudes gay when they're inside and then when they get outside it's like just shut up about it. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:35       Well I want to ask you about that because you, you do all the UFC stuff like sometimes, you know. Okay, so UFC starts right. And it was like tank Abbott. There was like, it was more like street fighter back then there was like a sumo guy with like a boxer and then at some point it all went straight to like grappling. Right. So on any given UFC fight, if you just walk into the room, all the fights playing, most of the fights end up on the floor. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       A lot of them do. Yeah. Less now I think then then more,

Speaker 2:          00:14:04       right. And then they're wearing the, uh, you know, the tight short shorts with a bone or bulges and there is a lot of 69 going on. There's a lot of like head to crotch grinding. It looks very homoerotic. You could if you were in and

Speaker 1:          00:14:18       two gay dudes and viewer in to dudes, especially if you were an athletic dudes, I would totally see how you could see, uh, two men grappling, especially bare chest to bare chest as being a homoerotic and just as you there, I mean people, but it's really based upon your sexual preference. If you're into that. Yeah, you would think that's homoerotic, but if you're not, it's not, you know what I'm saying? If you're not gay, it's just two dudes fighting. Right. If you are gay, you'd be psyched. Maybe you can enjoy it on another level. Like you, it would be like, not just fighting, but fighting with like too hot dudes that you're like really getting excited by it. So you're getting excited by the fight itself and you get excited by the fact that you would like to suck both their cocks after it's over.

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       Thank them for the show. Yeah. I mean, you know, sometimes you know this move at the Strip club when you go and the girl like gives you a simulated blowjob, like she's blowing your budget using the top of her head. Yeah, I seen that in the UFC move, like the guys like grinding his forehead on the guy's crotch it. I'm like, Oh fuck a stripper just did that to me. Yeah, the head job, you wouldn't want that if you had a big heart cup on though. It doesn't feel as good. You want like sweat pants. That's true. I knew it dude. Who used to take a those nylon sweat pants and you know the nylon sweatpants. That dude's used to wear the joggers back in the nineties remember those blue nylon sweatpants people used to wear? He took those and he sanded it with thousand grit sandpaper and the crotch.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       Who would get it? Like he could hold it up to the light and see his fingers and then he would squirt lube. He's shaved his cock and ball. Complete complete shave or like where the store is going to score it. Lube all over himself, put his sweatpants on and then he would go to the Strip club and it was called shooting. Who goes shooting. Oh. And the girls would sit down and we give him a lap dance and essentially he's wearing a condom. Wow. How can advance, I said, that's pretty clever. You know, he's a very smart guy. I used to live at the Strip club pretty much in Vegas and nobody figured that out there. Like me and my friend Harry, when we'd go, we'd take our genes off and like put on sweatpants. Right. Someone new to our group would be like, what are you guys doing?

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       We're like, dude, we're about to get lap dances, but this, this takes that to the whole other level. Dude brought out grinding down. That's fucking awesome. Without sandpaper to the point where the shit was like almost transparent. He was using like 1500 grit, which is like what you would use to gently clean off the shaft of a pool cue. You know what, I'm that kind of dust, just a slight level of dust every [inaudible] basis. This is so amazing. He, uh, he wore that shit down where he could get his fingers so he could see his fingers in the light. That's when he knew, like he was technically still close with was this guy, this guy's name happened to be Yoshi [inaudible] clever. This guy was a very smart dude. I won't give his name, but uh, he, uh, it's like, and it's imperative that you shave the cock and balls.

Speaker 1:          00:17:18       She goes, you want to have no hair, no hair anywhere. Yeah. Like an old technique to everything. It's fantastic. And then he's like, then you go Astroglide but then one time, I guess he put on too much Astroglide and a girl got on his lap, but she goes, what the fuck the fuck is this? And he was like, Oh yeah, I'm sorry. She was, what are you doing? What are you doing? I couldn't believe that just, and I said, he got caught. He was horrified. Please. Well, you know, he basically took it too far. He wasn't, he just wearing the nylon and you got the lube on underneath and she really probably can't tell at first, but he like had a puddle in his pants. He tried to get crafty, but he's tried to make a monument to this guy every strip club. Well for a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:18:03       Like he goes when he had his own business and he was really dedicated to his business, very hard on paper business. He was selling shooting pants. He uh, he, he had this business and so he didn't have any time for, for dating. So what he would do is he would go and work all fucking day on his own business. Then he would eat dinner, he would order, take out, then he would go to the Strip club and his shooting pants and he would have the ritual get one off and then he'd go back home. And that's what he would do every day, whenever you want, whenever you want it. And that was how he avoided relationships. For the longest time. I would just go, he would go shoot it cause he was just, he had a few bad relationships and he got fucked over. What does it checks?

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       He was in his 30s smart guy and he just was like, he was very logical to his approach to solving problems. Where's he at now? I haven't talked to him in a long time. I don't know. Can I ask you a question? Sure. So I just walked in here and you guys have all these sex at dawn books and like I read that too, cause I'm interested in human sexuality and all that stuff, especially the shemale stuff. So when I look at you, I see like the last of a dying breed of man, like sort of like the intellectual jock. Like you're like, you're like a pretty big guy that can beat the shit out of people, but you're also like, well read intelligent. So what is your whole take on all this? Like do you, are you married? Do you have a girlfriend? I'm married.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       Oh you are? I'm married. I have kids and everything. I have the whole deal. That's, you know, it is crazy. And we are for a long time. I've been married for quite a few years now. But for me, um, the, the difference that happens when you, uh, when you have kids, right, is so hard to wrap your head around. Like for anybody that's not married and doesn't have kids. Once you have like a little, you a great day running around like the love that you have for them is so it's really, you could never imagine that it would even be possible. So it's a real mind fuck went. How old are your kids? I have a 16 year old stepdaughter. I have a four year old and a two year old. Well the fours, almost five the two songs, three pretty major. Unbelievably fascinating. And cupcake over here.

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       Who's about 30 Oh, so when I hear, when I hear it, you're like, okay, here's like the married path with like kids. And then here's the other path with the shooting pants. Like I aimed more towards the shirt and pants. You know what man? Shooting pants. If the whole deal is finding a compatible person, right? If you don't find a compatible person, you find somebody wants to fight all the time, find someone to test you, find someone who's not at peace themselves, you're going to have fucking problems. Can always find something wrong with people. Yeah. But as a, you know, a man who probably gets hit on by chicks, the time those fucking

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       ring girls are super smoking hot. Like I mean, how do you deal with that? Jerk off, keep it together, do your best. I know a great guy that has immense collection of shemale porn that I could hook you up

Speaker 1:          00:21:02       with. The idea of caring hard porn is so ridiculous these days with the, all the websites. It does the industry frown upon the websites. They look at it. Other people look at, do you know he's told me laying,

Speaker 4:          00:21:16       do you know what the uh, that there's still, they still print video cassettes and like the VHS, like I don't know anyone who buys porn except stuff for myself. But for in general, I don't know one person who ever buys pornography, like DVDs even has like a porn pass or any of that stuff. And so Yoshi educated me that he said that the last, the thing that keeps this business alive is people like 50 and over. All pervert. Yeah. They're scared to use computers. So they still go to the store and they buy DVDs and VHS tapes and then once their debt

Speaker 1:          00:21:52       dead, then this business will be dead. So the old perverts who just stuck with their ways, they have this way, they liked the remote control to liked to be able to sit there on the bed.

Speaker 4:          00:22:02       There are also prayed the government might get them, they're probably right. You know, because there's no, you know, there's nothing of it on their computer. So

Speaker 1:          00:22:13       cause you're, you're trusting the companies that every one of those girls are 18 and older. It's a funny thing man. But if someone who is in a high position of power, like say a political person and they found that they had tranny porn at their house, even though it's totally legal. Right. And even know you're saying it's the biggest market. So it represents a lot of human beings that are into that stuff. You'd be done, right? Yeah, for sure. How weird is that? Why, why is, how weird is it that we give a fuck about, like Jimmy Norton is a very good friend of mine. I love that. I love that guy. I don't care that he jerks off to trainings at all. It doesn't bother me that he's had training experiences. It's Hilarious when he tells you about it, like the, the fact that you would judge what tweaks someone sexually wants, what the heart wants.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       But it's complete like that. It's a weird sort of homophobia that still accepted. It's, it's a weird sort of prejudice that's still accepted that your sexual preference and even if you're a nice person, even though you're nice and you know you're intelligent, we'll, we'll judge you based on whether or not you jerk off to dudes with dicks or dudes or looks like chicks with dicks. I remember even lady the late eighties that stolen or didn't want to have interracial tapes, thinking most of the customer in Seattle, we hate it. But the reaction once we've got the interracial stuff is opposite. It's always the white doctors, white lawyers. Why Cpa? Yeah. You know, so well, the disproportionate amount of interracial porn, it's sold in the deep south. Oh, utilize like number one poor market. It's white dudes, white dudes watching black guys. Fuck white girls. Yeah. That couple films him, it, yeah, those are weird.

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       But that's something I didn't see comment. The, the cold market. If folks, if you're normal and you're listening to this and you're not all fucked up in the head like us, where we can just say caught cold and no one has to worry whether or not anybody understands what it means. Apparently there's a group of dudes who like watching other guys fuck their women. Yeah, yeah. And they like, especially like big black guys. So what is it called? The Mandingo clove or something. There's a lot to bring like seven men dingoes it's like, like, it's like just this black crew of like guys with dicks like you know, over 12 inches. Whoa. And they just come and be like, fuck the sure. 12 inches. Just stop and think about that. It's not just one dude. There's like many guys with dicks over 12 inches out.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       That's like a horse race. I think the vice guys made an awesome documentary about it shortly. It's do is a big Dick. It's just specifically about the cook hold stuff. It's cold from Mandingo goes Oh. Like it's a mandate ago. I didn't, I didn't even know that was a, I thought man didn't go was just the name of a porn star. But I guess it's a whole movement. I think. I thought, I thought, I think the slave owners had a one prize black guy in each farm and did I think they call them Mandingo. I think that's where it started. It real. Yeah. So you can go to this and get your wife man didn't go, oh my God, that's fucking insane thinking about it. No, I don't think Mrs Rog and I appreciate that. Um, yeah, we should probably wouldn't. I don't want to know. That's really what it's about.

Speaker 1:          00:25:26       I see Joe going to one of those parties where you are wearing masks, you know, but I wear a Batman mask, white porcelain bullshit. If you make me marijuana mask and it'd be Batman. But the, when I did Dave show, we were talking about David tells a porn show. Thanks for doing it. But that was fine. It was a lot of fun. Yoshi works on that show. But when I did it and we were looking at John Home, so like his dick ain't even big by today's standards. Like it's Kinda crazy. Like he was the guy who had the big giant cock. Now there's so many black guys with Dick's way bigger than John Holmes. Well, they weren't allowed. They weren't allowed in the porn back then. That's why. Is that what it is? I think so. Yeah. I'm, I'm matching. So people had to get tired of white people, fucking white women where they're like, listen, we've got a million videos of white girls getting fucked by white guys with three quarter heart deck.

Speaker 1:          00:26:14       Okay. Can we bring in some brothers? And then they're like, okay, we'll just try this out and see how it works. Boom. Smash hit big black dudes with giant Dicks, fucking white girls and just changes. And for girls, like that's like part of their currency, right? That they haven't had interracially like that's like that. That helps them sell at a lot of markets, right? Yeah. Full a full lot of their stars. They, that their manager would tell them, don't do it. Well you could charge more money. I've talked to extensively just started in my podcast

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       with also a carer who just won 2012 what is it podcast called? All right, so just like for the same audience out there that doesn't know what cook hold is. The name of the podcast is DVD, a s a n. It's all the podcasts or a DVD, a s a.com. But basically this is a pretty much all I talked to us about because I was like, is that true? When you fuck a black dude then your rate goes down. And that was actually sort of a myth. But the shit now, so DVD, asa stands for double Vatche, double anal, a sensitive artist.

Speaker 7:          00:27:19       So

Speaker 4:          00:27:21       also always gets pissed cause she's like Dave get it straight. I didn't do DVD cause if you do DVD a then it's for Dick's at the same time. She said I did DV break and then at another time I did da. Yeah. So that's two dicks in your ass at once. And it's like, you know, it's medically dangerous. I mean she can't sit for like a week after that. I mean, it's like really? Yeah. It's like we were, we were, we just grilled her about this. It's, and the thing is, why does she do that? She's a little, you know, she's five feet two. Yeah. There's like, there's like the, Yoshi knows more about porn than I do, but for what I know, most of the girls that do this are usually like ugly and Noni and porn stars. So for someone like asa who has a huge name to do it, it's like, it's like, whoa.

Speaker 4:          00:28:06       Like, and she's tiny, you know? Why is she doing it? Because it's, well, check out insatiable to Joe. You'll, I'll explain it to you. I went, I went, I went with her to the porn awards. Insatiable. I went with her to the porn awards last year and she won best anal, best double penetration to two years in a row. So I was like, you know, after the thing, you know, it was a, it's a weird thing to celebrate, you know? Right. Cause this is like, you're the best, but fucky right. You're the, you got, but fuck the best out of anyone this year. You're right, you got penetrated. Oh my God, I'm so happy for you. Oh my God, you won the award. That's amazing. Yeah. But you know, I love her. So I'm like sitting there and, um, I think I'm just like, there's not a huge success rate for porn stars after porn.

Speaker 4:          00:28:56       Right. Like, it's like you either got a bag of rich dude or you got to get out before it just completely destroys your soul and it's too late. I mean, yeah, no, you're absolutely right. And I saw a documentary about it. [inaudible] porn. Yeah. How was that? I just saw the first 20 minutes and it was like super sad and I was like, oh yeah, I know. And I was like, you're at the top right now. You won the fucking, she was walking out of here like this with like all the awards. I was like, you want everything this year and last year. Right. And like you fucking dis like for, I'm trying to tell her to quit. I'm not trying to totally equipment like start like, like if a porn star one performer of the year, like 10 years ago. Right. That means she was like really sexy and like did sexy shit. Like if win performer of the year now in 2012 2013 that means you took dicks like brutally, like you're like slang, like like a fucking bag of dicks. Like just giving them

Speaker 6:          00:29:51       wars and saying good job and so these girls are working towards these, you watch these. They don't, they look like snuff films. Yeah, they all like getting dragged across the ground and throwing against the wall and like, it's like Caveman Shit. Hearst Hearst. If he checked out insatiable, which I know is not going to do any more insatiables as an example in Saint Paul, she's getting dragged by her hair down there and just pretty much gagged and it does. It looks like a snake. It looks like rape or something horrible. Why are people into that? That's what people want. There's two things people want now, like shit like that. It's a parody. It's a thing.

Speaker 4:          00:30:23       The the, the shemale stuff. It's like they've already seen everything. What's the next thing? And it's funny you said, what is next? Are you going to have to fucking animals. You can get your head chopped off in the next one. Yeah. You know, what is she saying? I she, she's one of the, one of the girls that genuinely loves porn. Like she loves being, she's like, and that's why a lot of the fans like her, cause she's not like, oh I'm just going to do this until I get my real estate license. Like she loves it. So she sent a rough sex. She loves fucking, she loves it now. So she's amazing. She is. She is amazing. I love her. I love her too.

Speaker 1:          00:30:55       It's a funny thing that people would like, you know, the natural instinct is to go, Oh God, what the fuck are you guys talking about? She's amazing. She's taking two dicks in her house. Oh my God. He's amazing. But the reality is porn is something that a fucking lot of people watch, but nobody gives anybody credit for being good at it.

Speaker 4:          00:31:13       Oh, I mean, that's the other thing too is like, he's right about that

Speaker 1:          00:31:16       because you look, we've all had bad sexual experiences where someone wasn't into it. That girl was like, oh, you know, and you're like, and you know you're losing your erection, right? She's like, what's wrong? I'm like, what the Fuck's wrong with you? Like I'm kind of a confrontation that we have in here. This is nuts. So you, what you see like on a, in a scene when a girl is like really into getting fucked or the reality of it like gets you excited. Right? But if someone's sucks at it, it's not good. Or if all seen bad porn, I mean, there's a lot of porn out there. It's not all good.

Speaker 4:          00:31:49       And usually the hot chicks, you know, they don't fuck like, Ugh, ugly fat girls, you know? So when you have a hot chick that does fuck like, you know, fat, ugly chick, then it's like amazing. You know? And she's amazing because she's done scenes where gang bangs, bunch of guys, and I know half of those guys didn't take a bath. Oh. And she'll smile. And just do it like professionally random strangers. That's the other thing. [inaudible] porn. So these guys are hoping they doing that. You don't want that to Mike to be that close to his mouth. Cause that's the other thing we figured out. The podcast is pretty much me, Yoshi and asa and all this dude does is eat acid out of hookers and Austin, she, she eats a lot of acid. Like no, she said a lot of those guys don't shower and stuff. So I'm like, I'm on a show with two people that he'd asked and all day, don't get pink eye from this mic are you probably have a good immune system of that.

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       Your immune system is doing battle all. Yo, she's aids. I'm glad. I'm glad you said that. It about me. Well Yoshi and Brian's aids in the same room. What they are is like two competing beehives and they're fucking, they're hovering in the middle of the room trying to work the situation out. Yeah. Your shorts tells guy who's aids dominates this room. You can only get it once. Right now you get twice. We had this guy on and uh, I have to tell people, listen to this podcast, we have found a molecular biologist to debate Dr Peter Duesberg. We had this guy on the podcast and a lot of people got really angry at me. He's a professor of biology at the University of California Berkeley and he's got this crazy theory about HIV and aids and he doesn't believe that HIV causes AIDS. He believes that the drugs that people give people for Hiv there what really is going on with these people's, they have a compromised immune system from drug use and you're giving them a drug that's designed to kill a disease that they don't even, it's not even the cause of their illness.

Speaker 1:          00:33:39       He's saying that caused the illness is the fact that they're taking all these drugs and the people that are in HIV research, they think he's fucking crazy. And a lot of people got mad at us for having them on [inaudible] and it's a controversial situation because obviously he's smarter than me. I don't, I'm not a professor of biology and he's got tenure and he does like peer reviewed stuff on, on, on cancer. That's very well respected like to this day. But he's got this wacky opinion on, on an HIV and you know, he insists that no one wants to debate them. So we got this guy who was finally willing to debate them and I'll announce all of it when everything gets signed away and we figured out what day they're going to both fly in. But we're going to bring him in here and we're going to have them debate as long as it takes on the podcast and either, you know, either Duesberg is fucking crazy or do's Burges at genius and we have a real problem with the way people perceive this one particular disease.

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       I don't fucking know. I'm just hoping that I can figure out how to navigate through the waters cause I'm basically going to be like a referee in a contest that I don't understand. Right. But, uh, you know, with aids besides Brian and Yoshi, well they have the most days, but uh, yeah, I know a guy was HIV. I know at least one guy. The only, the only time in my life that I've ever seen anyone with aids and it was like a lot, a lot of aids was when I was in Africa. Like that's like that was part of Duisburg problem with it. And he said that what you're seeing in Africa is not people that have HIV. It's people that have no, no nutrition. He's like, you're seeing compromised immune systems because they're, they're starving and they're, they're in horrible climates. Where there's a lot of waste around a lot is you're seeing a lot of different things.

Speaker 1:          00:35:18       He's like, they're not testing these people for HIV. He goes, and the, the amount of people that they have tested that, that do have HIV in Africa, he said the number hasn't increased, but the population has tripled the population of Africa. They were saying it's going to be decimated by AIDS. And he was like, well, if that's the truth, why the population increased by three preparation was like, he said, it was like, this is all Duesberg, I'm paraphrasing, but he said, I believe it was like 500 million and now it's over a billion. So he was like, the population tripled. They got 12 inch dicks. They look the fuck. Yeah. Well the idea is that if aids was a communicable disease, like people are describing it, it would have swept through Africa and decimated the population. And he's saying because it didn't, not even by any stretch of the imagination, he said it's, it backs up his idea that it's something that's brought a bond and in Africa by poor nutrition in America, by drug use.

Speaker 1:          00:36:13       I don't know man. I know gay dudes love to party and that's something that can't be ignored. They fucking love to party. And it could be a combination of them. Loving to party makes them more susceptible to certain diseases and illnesses. But we all know that I have, I have a friend who they, they, you know, they're married and they're, you know, they're, they're gay folks and they have a total normal married life, but they also have friends who are gay that they talk about their, their buddies that they party with. And these guys are fucking savages. When you get a direct line into how gays and these are gay professional men. I mean one guy, yeah, one guy owns a clothing company and he's really rich. And another guy, he owned some other business and he, uh, he actually pays a straight guy and had sex with him.

Speaker 1:          00:37:04       He's like got the straight Russian guy that, uh, that he paid. Like the guy was like broke working at a bar and so for paying him for sex and he fucks has got a regular button up. So now it bought this guy car, puts a guy up in an apartment and just goes and bangs them and they go out and they fucking party hard party hard man. And it might be just be this guy's buddies, but you know, when I meet these dudes and they start telling me stories about the fucking, the throw downs that they all have together, wow, they fucking go out and do crazy drugs. You know, they're in this dance culture all the time and they love to take ecstasy and they get together and you know, snorting coke, that's a part of what they're doing. That's fun. And that shit will decimate your immune system.

Speaker 1:          00:37:50       Whether or not dues Berg's correct about all of his assumptions about aids that outside of, let's set that aside for a minute and just look at the fact that there's so many of these dudes taking those drugs and that those drugs will fuck you up. That is a fact. Whether or not HIV causes AIDS, the majority of scientists say it does. So I have to go with them. I mean the majority support, the idea that it's this ever altering and changing disease, it's very hard to figure out. And then it decimates immune system if they, I don't imagine that you could keep something like that a secret if it wasn't true. So having him on was, um, it was a tricky thing because I can't debate him. And I had my friend Brian Callin on, he tried to debate him but he got smushed. Right. Cause you gotta have another genius. Yeah. You're going to have another gene. Yeah. So we're doing that. So that's, that's coming up. I'm going to keep hope alive that there's a cure for you buddy. No, Yoshi is AIDS isn't curable. It's and get his own. Yeah, it's its own thing. It's like a fingerprint. Sorry Bro. And that's like fucking with my aides, it'd be like King Kong versus Godzilla.

Speaker 1:          00:38:56       You could get a film camera in there and make a cartoon reenactment of what they say. He would just see aids doing battle with aids. The dressed up like gladiators from a scene of Lord of the rings, just just ogre aids and on the other side of troll aids and they have fucking shields on, on their chest and battering rams and they're going to war inside. Yo, she's asked somebody make that cartoon but you just got to throw that mic out after this feels though. Yo should, we will spray it. I'm going to let you know fill this. Don't feel sad. We're going to spray it because I saw a few of those spittles they flew off your mouth. Why you got really particularly excited about things and that's like Panspermia. That's how like asteroids hit other planets and that's how life gets to earth. I see. So your aids leap frogging onto that, you know, very moist sponge microphone cover. That's like perfect habitat for super aids. I just want to make sure they were just joking. I don't have a cause I'm just, I can't believe I have to tone down your fucking professional comedian. Jesus Christ. Guess what? Brian doesn't have aids either. Wink, wink.

Speaker 4:          00:40:04       That's the other shit is like, are you guys are on iTunes? Yeah. Yeah. We're on iTunes. But see like we just started our shit and we talk about like aids and rape like every like how the fuck are you

Speaker 1:          00:40:13       all right? Did you start talking about poop? Well, there's nothing wrong with it. You know w what, what, what we're saying, we didn't say we didn't advocate rape, we didn't advocate anybody getting dragged away by their hair or mouth fucked. We're just like, it's a real, it's educational podcast. It's very much an educational part. I'm surprised where in comedy and the comedy section.

Speaker 4:          00:40:32       Well see that's what like we didn't write in our description like it's DVD a asa, but we didn't, right. It's double vaginal, double anal, whatever. And so, you know, my manager is like, dude, you could have a porn star on there and you have this fucking guy. Like do you want ever to have non porn star guests? Like real guests on? Really you'll have normal guests. Well we have this currency now. Like for me, I haven't painted in a while and like my paintings have gone like, you know, like ridiculously expensive. So I could paint yes. To bribe them to come on. And then also said last May and she said she'll blow anyone who comes on our show. Really? Yeah. And she was, and she said, it's like, so like not joking, like whatever,

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       can I come? That's, that's, see, that's what keeps hope alive. It's good currency to have you here and things like that. That is excellent current. So, you know, people would go on your show anyway, period. You know, why would they not want to go on? I don't know. They don't want their career destroyed. So silly in this day and age, people are silly. Gotta they gotta relax. Just be who the fuck you are. You know? And especially in a podcast form is the best place for that because you get a chance to express yourself for hours. Definitely. It's not like if you said something fucked up and then like, remember when Hugh grant got blown by that hooker and got arrested and went on the tonight show and Jay Atlanta goes, what the hell were you thinking? Right, right. Jay Leno does his famous line that brought the tonight show back and you know when they have those shows and they talk about, you know, the, the history of the war between the tonight show and the David Letterman show, that was the show that turned the tide.

Speaker 1:          00:42:05       Or Jay Leno looked at Hugh grant and said, what the hell were you thinking? Right. Well, when he did that, you know, and that was like this tiny little conversation then only took place over a couple of minutes. When you love to sit Hugh grant down, give him a glass of wine and give him some weed and talked to him for hours and go like, how many, how many hookers did you can? You can tell me. Yeah. I mean you and Elizabeth, whatever the fuck her name was, he broken up. She was super hot and she was super like one of the hottest chicks ever. And like even with that, do you have to go out and get this strange new pussy? He got dirty street. Needed that nasty. Yeah. He's a rich, famous man. If he wanted to, he could. This is before the Internet, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:42:43       He could've gone to get a like la weekly and gotten a prostitute. Right. They always had that 30 he wanted, he wanted it. He wanted to go street girlfriend, but she's still beautiful. But my early, early, yes. Hurley, my reaction was, I don't think she's nasty and bed. Oh, you just can probably lazy. Listen. Probably Lazy. Maybe lazy with Hugh Grant. Oh, I bet with the right dude gets a hold of her. She'll fuck the life outta here. Okay. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. It's just, you've got to impress a girl like that. You got to fuck the shit out of her. Right. That girl's so pretty and she's famous. You've got to do a lot of work. So he's probably tired of doing all that work. You want to pull over and just get his dick sucking bitch. Get in the car. So here's your money.

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       That's what he wanted. He wanted some crazy moment, like the exact opposite of what it is at home or at home. He probably has to work for it, man. She probably turns him down all the time. It's probably argues with them. She's probably challenges. That's why I don't understand why you got married, cause you're, you're like a free dude. You're like, I'm going to do comedy, I'm going to do UFC shit. I'm gonna have my own podcast. It's like that part of your life is so free. And then like, I've done like everything I can to like be married, you know, to not be mad, to not be married and like, that's why a little bit, well, it's, it's, it's all about finding the right person. If you find the right person and you have starting to having children, having a child. To me it's way more of a commitment.

Speaker 1:          00:44:07       The kid first. Okay. Having a child's Wayne warm got pulling out. I suck at pulling out. Yeah. The whole bit about it. The first one wasn't planned, the second one was planning. Oh, okay. But uh, yeah man, I just preposterous. The idea is ridiculous. The idea that you're gonna write some shit down and that someone is going to be legally entangled with you and then you're going to have to sit in front of a bunch of other people when you want to break up her, they have to decide how your money gets distributed. Yeah. It was crazy. And in your situation, it's a terrible idea because you've got a lot of money. That's before I had a lot of money that I never was into the idea of it. Of course it's stupid. It's a stupid idea. My, my wife likes it, so I did it because we have to make her up and it makes her happy and I'm not going anywhere, man.

Speaker 1:          00:44:51       I'm not going to be that guy. I mean, history, hookers, none of that shit. I want to make a robot dirty streets. So it's not a real close person or they're getting closer to making that you were at the Avn awards, right? Yeah, they had a, they had fucked up people. Again, I think the adult video news awards, they had a lot of, uh, like kind of real doll technology there. And then they have one that like talks to you and still, it's still kind of just like, you're fucking a dead person. Oh, well they had a Japanese, they had a Japanese robot that was fairly realistic. It wasn't a sexual robot, but it was a robot that will like talk to you and for companionship. The lips moved fairly. Realistically. We're going to get to a blade runner day. It's going to have, we're getting there.

Speaker 1:          00:45:35       It's 100% I mean if you look at the fact that the, the, the super computers that they had in the 1960s filled entire rooms and they didn't have the power that your iPhone has. Just think about that and think about these robots now and what we're going to have a hundred years from now or a thousand years from now, but the blade runner thing is 100% inevitable. You're invited to the wedding with the first robot. You're going to marry a robot dude. They'll kill you, they'll kill you when they find out that you, you, you have an explanation data on them. Can I just, if you bought super hot robot hookers and they have this implanted memory or if their life with you, this perfect life with you and how deeply, deeply, deeply in love with you they are, and then they realize that at line on year five they die because that's when you get tired of chicks and you want to bring in another one and program a new life into her brain. This saifai portrait total real. Here's the thing

Speaker 4:          00:46:31       thing is like when you go to like a sex store or a porn convention like that and you see like the dildos that they have like this advance a dildo technology, they teledildonics or whatever. It's like there's not a human dick that could do what these dildos do. They vibrate, they rotate and they go like this. So I think last year, right last year was like the first year I went and I'm walking out and there's like a hard drive that looks like that and the guy's like, come over here. And I'm like, no, he's like,

Speaker 7:          00:46:56       come over. He's like, he's like, he's like stickers

Speaker 4:          00:47:00       finger in that in the computer right there. And I'm like, no, I don't want to. And he's like, dude, there was no one else around. He was like, just stick your finger in that hard drive. And I was like, all right. And I stuck it in and it was wet and it was warm and it was doing things a human vagina can never do. It was like, and I was like, I'm about to come out of my face.

Speaker 7:          00:47:20       And I was like, just the same way girls

Speaker 4:          00:47:23       who use a lot of builders, they're pussies become desensitized. I was like, if I buy this thing right now, I'll never fucking

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       leave the house again. I'll fuck this little computer box. And if they put it into one of these android things, I mean there won't be a, a woman who has a vagina like tighter than that.

Speaker 1:          00:47:40       There was a science fiction comic book that I read when I was a kid. I'll never forget it was a heavy metal stuff or it was something along those lines. It was, um, it was, uh, well, whatever it was was a black and white one. I don't remember. It was a robot that started, um, the guy had a robot as a, you know, like a slave or whatever. But the robot was like very humanlike and like very muscular and big. And the robot started fucking his wife and then he went to stop the robot from fucking, his wife from the robot broke his arm. And like, it's really scary thing. It's rubber. It had this big giant cock and like it was in the, you know, the thing that he was going to continue fighting. The robot was like laughing as he was fucking his wife while the guys like thinking what did I do like holding his broken arm, which soft fucked up all this robot fucks his wife. But that image like really stuck into my head. Cause I, it if we really do develop,

Speaker 2:          00:48:31       uh, artificial human being that thinks it's a human being, right. And especially if we make them ridiculously strong or they're going to fuck your wife and they're going to break your arm. If you tried to stop him here, get it. We're not going to, they're not read that website. Brian, the robot robot. Robot robot.

Speaker 1:          00:48:51       Oh yeah. We're so desensitized. We need conch holding. We need mouth gagged. Can Double Anal double vag.

Speaker 2:          00:49:00       I mean, it's crazy. They already to do that in Japan. These guys aren't ya? Oh, Taco. Like there's crazy fan of a educators subject like porn or whatever right there during the ceremonial marriage thing with the robots and shit like that in Japan. Oh really? In Japan? Yes, yes. My home parish. It's weird. I get it. But yeah, they're doing that. It's, it's really interesting. I, like I said, I'm happy, but I wouldn't recommend it. I wouldn't recommend it on the right one. Yeah. But it's not, it's not a commander is I don't like to talk to. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:32       The um, um, the odds of finding somebody, the odds of finding somebody that you get along with as good as I get along with her, they're pretty slim. I haven't found that many people in my whole life that I get along with like that. Right. You just, you get, it's a compatibility thing cause I'm not the right dude for a lot of chicks. Right. You know, and you're not the right dude for a lot of chicks. It's like you got to find the one who's like, that's what I've been looking for and, and Eh, well, I'm happy to hear that, man. That's cool, man.

Speaker 1:          00:50:02       It's good to be happy. And it's the, um, the idea of being able to raise kids. It was always, I guess a real scary thing for me when I was younger. Like it wasn't on when I was in my twenties. I thought of it as like a burden. That's all I thought of it as like, oh my God, imagine if I had a kid right now, I'd be fucked. Right. I don't even like feeding my cat if I had a kid like Jesus Christ. Right. But once you go through the experience and you'd become an adult, you kind of have a different perspective on the idea of a finite lifetime. Right. And the idea of the, the concept of being able to raise a human from the very beginning and like educate them and expose them to different things along the way to communicate with them. How old were you when you had your first kid?

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       The first biological kid? I was 40. Uh, see it's totally different. So guys like you and boarding and give me hope because I think Bordain had his first kid or I think it was 50. I think when he had his first game or it's, um, it's easier to understand what's going on right? When the, when, if I was 21 if I got my girlfriend pregnant and I would, I buried her back, then I might get so overwhelmed by the responsibility of it all and not being a Co. The other thing is that I'm in a comfortable place in my life where I don't have to worry about shit or worry about my job or I've been working for the UFC for like 12 years now and then even more before like 11 year it's been 11 years, but even more back in the day it's like another two years from another owner may have been doing this for so long. It's not something I worry about losing.

Speaker 4:          00:51:32       So out of all this, like out of all the things that you do and you do, you used to do the fear factor, you do the UFC, you do your podcast, you can do standup comedy like out of all these things like which is your passion that you, is it all like I love everything or

Speaker 1:          00:51:47       I really do love everything, but it's like all except fear factor. I just, I loved the money from fear factor. Right? That was it. Every now and then. I loved it. You know, every now and then. It was fun. It was fun when they were cool people, you know, look, it could be cool, but I wouldn't do it for free. Right, right. And I would do all the other shit for free because you love it. Yeah. It's all the other shit. I don't think, oh, I'm just doing this for my, for the money. Right. It's a and and doing something that you like. The difference between say the UFC seen fear factor was sometimes I would enjoy fear factor. When I worked for the UFC, I always enjoy it. I mean I like some people might think is a boring fight I enjoy because anything can happen. It might be boring for a couple seconds and it dude gets cracked and it becomes the most exciting shit at me. Right, right. You know, I'm ready. I enjoy it. So the differences dif you, if you're doing something you're only doing for the money, right? You're always going to have this, this feeling like, all right, just plow through this and do it for the money. But when you're doing something that you love, you'll eliminate that bad feeling.

Speaker 4:          00:52:47       Well, that's the thing is when I watched those, I'm like, well, like when I hear you doing the announcing for UFC, I'm like, this guy sounds like he's super, super pumped right now. Like, you know, it sounds like you're into it. So, and like you're like, oh, when you were like referring back to fights from like 10 years earlier, I'm like, is there something in front of you showing those things you remember?

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       No, that's not only that. I don't even do any research. You just love the sport. Yeah. My, uh, my research can do some trivia with you. Sure. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:53:12       All right. So the first time Bj Penn fought George St Pierre was like in Vegas 10 years ago or eight?

Speaker 1:          00:53:20       No, no, it was that long ago. It was probably 2006 I would, I would gas, I'm not, I mean, I, I can't tell you the exact numbers, but I can tell you what happened in the fight. So who won that fight? Uh, well, George won the fight, but who really? I thought Bj did more damage. And all George did was take him down a couple of times in the later rounds. But BJ thumb, George and the eye is a very interesting fight. He thumb thumb George in the eye in the first round and the right eye and he had a cut and that really fucked with them. And that was the first time George had faced like real serious adversity inside the cage. It's because it wasn't a thumb on purpose. It's like people have to realize that, um, because the fact that thumbs aren't exposed even with a legitimate punch, a total, which pj's was completely legitimate punch, oftentimes a thumb can go right, right.

Speaker 1:          00:54:05       Or any of the eyeball. Right. And uh, you could really fuck up a Guy's vision from that. And you know, it was just because Bj had cleaner striking back then. I mean, he fucking won the fight. I think you want to fight too because uh, I believe he won. He did more damage and I think ultimately the Japanese had a better way of judging fights then. Then the standard 10 point must system that we use, which is really like a boxing system. This is unbelievable. This is fucking crime at Joe's. The real deal. I mean, you watch how many fights, the fact that you remember that from the, well, I've called at least a thousand. Jesus Christ. At least

Speaker 4:          00:54:39       you wanna hear a funny story about that fight. Yeah, sure. So I just, I was in the Congo.

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       How many stories begin with that?

Speaker 4:          00:54:50       I was there, I was there for vice and I, and I just came back to La and, um, I have a bit of a gambling problem and the way my gambling, uh, career, I guess is set up is, um, basically, yeah, 2006 or around that time, like six, seven years ago when I was going there, I was going there every week and winning about a thousand dollars. And then I would stop. That's, I could, I could for sure go to Vegas and when, you know, between 800 and a thousand dollars, you know, and that, that was what I was doing for money. And then I would be painting on the side or whatever. And I would do that every week. So I came back from Africa and I was going to go on, you know, I was going to fly to go or drive to go see my parents.

Speaker 4:          00:55:33       I hadn't seen them in a few months. And um, Bj was being sponsored by their clothing company. Ruca do you know RVC sure. Yeah, I know those guys. So pat the owner is one of my best friends and he goes, Dave, you've got to take a BJ's. The fight was the next day with George Saint Pierre. And he said, uh, something with the logo was not big enough or something. So he still had the pants. He's like, these pants need to get to, to, to, uh, to Bj in Vegas. And I said, all right, so sense of why, why do I got to go? He's like, cause you fucking Love Vegas. And I'm like, dude, I, I'm still wearing the same clothes that I was wearing in Congo for like two months. Like I need to go shower, I need to go see my parents. He's like, he's like Dave. And then he passes me $40,000, which was the most amount of cash I'd ever seen in my life.

Speaker 4:          00:56:20       And he goes, you need to go put this on Bj to win. And I, Whoa, dude. He's like, you love to gamble. I trust you. He goes, go give Bj his pants and you know, go give Bj's pants and go put this money on Bj Darwin. And I was like, are you sure dude? And he's like, I was like, so he gives me, um, he gives me a clean shirt. It was just like a Bj Penn security shirt. You know what I said, Bj Penn and, and security on the back. So I take the red eye into Vegas and sitting next to me in a safe way. Plastic bag is Bj Penn's pants and in my pocket is $40,000. And he goes, when you get to Vegas, go to go up to the penthouse Bj, it was at Mandalay Bay, I think. He goes, go, go to Mandalay bay.

Speaker 4:          00:57:08       And at this point I knew Bj. I wasn't as pretty good friends with them now, but I didn't know him that well back then. So I get there and I go upstairs to his room and he travels with his whole family. Then they, you know, they're usually like loud and fun and I get up to the room and uh, I have, I have his pants ago. Pat told me to bring you your parents and he's like, okay, thanks. And his brother, Reagan's like, it's just, it was like a weird vibe in the room. And I was like, what the fuck is going on dude? He's like, come over here. He's like the guy in the next room over brought home a 20 year old, 21 year old hooker. Fucked her and strangled her and then just dropped her in the hallway and until her and killed her, she's dead.

Speaker 4:          00:57:51       And because she was dead in the hallway right in front of Bj's room, they took beach even though they knew he didn't do it. Like they took him in for questioning. Yeah. So I'm like freaking out and he's like, dude, Bj's at the, been at the police station all day answering questions and he's, he has his fight tomorrow night. So I'm like, whoa. So I run downstairs. I called Pat Pat. This was the day of the wins or the day of the fight? The day before. The day before, day before the wedding. So he wasn't cutting any wait for that day right before the fight. The day right before the fight. So Day of the wedding. Yeah. So I, I don't know exactly cause I just got there at midnight. So I go downstairs, I go, Pat, are you sure you want me to put this money on him? Because he just came back from the police station.

Speaker 4:          00:58:37       He might not, he might have a little fuck dude. BJ's a champ. He doesn't, he's going to fucking smoke this guy. And for a guy who's been the Vegas like every week, I go there every week for like the last 20 years, I had never been to Vegas. It felt like this before. More Hawaiians that had never left Hawaiian. We're it, you know, this was like, they weren't even like the main fight, right? But like George Saint Pierre is the hero of Canada, so there was all these fucking Canadians in, in Vegas. And then there was all these Hawaiians in Vegas and it was just like a fuck fuck Canada and like fucking Hawaii. Like it was like I was playing cards and people would see my Bj pincher and they go, fuck Bj Penn, Fuck Hawaii. And then there are all these people will be like, it was like electric.

Speaker 4:          00:59:19       Like it was like crazy. And I was like, wow, pat, you want, are you sure rude? And then this is where I found out that, uh, a sports book is not actually part of the casino. It's a separate entity that's like rinse out. So I went and I said 40 grand on Bj Penn when, after I talked to Pat, I was like, Hey, are you sure you want me to put this money? He's like, Bj is going to kill this guy. It doesn't matter. He's, he's, he's got the heart of a champion. And I was like, all right. And I go in there and the odds, if you don't remember, everyone already thought Bj was going to win. So if I put 40 grand on Bj to win, I would only got back like 30 grand I think. And if I put 40 on St Pier, I would've got back like 70,000 I think.

Speaker 4:          00:59:57       So the odds are way in Bj Penn's favor so they wouldn't even take a bet that big. So I was like, Oh shit. So he's like, and they were, all the sports works were closing so they were like, you have to do it the next day. So I was like, all right, I'm going to, I'll just go to a strip club I guess. So I go to a strip club and as soon as I walk in or get out of the car, a security guard sees me and he goes right this way sir. And then he takes me to like this giant private room and I'm like, still smell like shit from Africa. And I'm like, they just bring over the hottest strippers. And then I'm like, what the fuck's going on? And I realized I'm wearing a Bj Penn security shirt. So they think Bj's coming.

Speaker 4:          01:00:34       They're like, they're like, when's Bj gonna come here? And all the security guards are like sucking my dick, just like Bj's is the best. He's going to win the fight tomorrow. And I was like, I was like, oh. So I'm like, I'm going to take advantage of the situation. I'm like, I'm like sitting there with my friend Harry. We were like getting lap dances, all this shit. And then I was like, fuck, they're going to at some point expect media to come here. So I sneak out the side and then, uh, I don't think I slept that night. And then the first, you know, I was, I was, I was, it was one of those nights where I stay at the Strip club till like the sun comes up and then the next day I start putting the money down on Bj to win. But it was like seven grand at like the, you know, the Venetian and then like eight grand over here and had to split it up a little bit.

Speaker 4:          01:01:16       So I, I, I was like running around and I couldn't get the money spread out so I was only able to bet like 32 grand and I still had eight grand in cash on me. And then the fight starts and like you said, like it was just like you said, like everyone, the place is going nuts. Like it's going fucking insane. Like everyone's like fuck, like getting off, Fuck Hawaii. And it's like, and then the fight happens. I'm like, Oh fuck St Pier, it looks bloody first round. I'm like, this fights done like Bj, Bj one and then saint peers, a smart fighter. So he liked deflected a lot or whatever. And then when decision time came around, they gave it to St pier by one point decision and the place goes whoa. And they started like screaming like I couldn't believe it. Like I'm like, oh my God, cause I had my own money on the fight too.

Speaker 4:          01:02:08       He walks offstage, his brothers like get them drunk right away. And then, I don't know if you go out at all after the fights or whatever, but I've never seen Vegas this violent before in my life. Like there was like street brawls inside casinos. There was Canadians beating up Hawaiians, Hawaiians beating up. Like, it was crazy. I knew Hawaiian guy that put his house up for the whole thing. And yeah, I mean, it was insane. People were going crazy. I've never, in all the years I've been in Vegas, I've never seen a situation like this where people had his house on Bj. Yeah. I mean it was fucking crazy. So what do you win when you bet your house? I don't know. I think in another house, I think you've just put the value of it up. I don't know. I don't know. The details are there.

Speaker 4:          01:02:50       So he lost his house. Yeah. So he lost his house and, and yeah. You saw the fight. I mean, I was looking at that guy's an idiot move. I mean, especially when you know that the judging and MMA judging and then my man, so sketchy. Yeah. I mean it was, it was fucking crazy. So then, um, just as a side thing, the girl that I was with were seven years then we had just broken up, happened to be in Vegas. So I was having dinner with her after and I was telling her what's happening. I was like, dude, I just lost $32,000 off my friends money on this thing. And she was like, oh. And I was calling him and I was saying, Hey pat, I still have eight grand of your money. Do you want me to gamble with it? And when you're 32 grand back and he's like, get your fucking ass back over here.

Speaker 4:          01:03:34       Like he was so pissed off and so I was just having dinner with her and then he calls me back and he goes, you know what I was, I was planning on winning the money or losing it. So go for it. And I was like, you want, I can do this. And remember I've only won a thousand dollars. That was like the most money I've ever won. I never even had like 8,000 or 40,000. So I was like, shit, I'm going to walk into that high limit room for the first time in my life. So, but I'm talking with her and you know, like right after a long break, you've been together with someone for a long time and you break up. There's like that maybe we're still going to get together. So like I'm like, fuck, I'm going to go gamble right now. And then in this situation, uh, the fuck was that guy, the rush hour guy, Chris, Chris Tucker.

Speaker 4:          01:04:19       So Chris Tucker and like, you know, a posse of like 40 people like walk in. Then they start hitting on her right away, right when I got up. So I was like, fuck, I got to go win this money. But like Chris Tucker, it looks like he's gonna. I was like sorta stuck. I was like, fuck, this mother fucker is hitting on my ex girlfriend. And I was like, all right, I'm just going to run and do it. So I walked into the Venetian high limit room for the first time and then eight grand in like thousand dollars chips. It's like, you know, it's like a little stack. And I split it up and I started playing like my system, the way I play, and I won about 36 grand within like 15 minutes. Whoa. And that fucked me up. It's like smoking weed your whole life and then doing cocaine, you know?

Speaker 4:          01:04:58       So then I called him, I was like, Hey pat, I, I'm up to 36. You want me to win the last? He said, get your fucking ass back to Costa Mesa right now. I was like, all right. All right. All right. I was like, I really think I could win the whole 40. He's like, stop, stop right now. So I stopped. And then, uh, yeah, I mean, I sort of blame basically Bj for my gambling problem because after that, after that moment, I could never go to Vegas again and just win a thousand. I had to like win at least 20 grand because of the rush. You can't go backwards, you know? Like, I'm like, I just want 36 grand with this guy's money. Why can't I win it with my own money? Right. So, and I didn't have that kind of money to gamble with, so I, you know, I like took a loan out to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:05:40       Like it was, he took a loan out. I was like started, I was very confident that I could do it, you know, so. Wow. Yeah. And how did that work out? I made a small fortune doing that. I can't, yeah, I can't, I can't play it. Most of the casinos in Vegas, I don't know. What do you play? I play every table game play poker. I don't really play so much. I played for fun and like now like sometimes they invite me to like celebrity poker things. I beat actually all the UFC guys. That'd be truck Ladell I beat uh, uh, um, fuck. I can't think of the guy's name right now. What is it about, why are you so good at this? Why are you still get a card games? I think to answer your question, I think it's because I'm really good at also pulling out, you know, like, no, I'm not even joking.

Speaker 4:          01:06:26       I'm really awesome at it. Like people were like the amount of funding you do, the fact that you haven't got a girl pregnant right now. Right. I'm like, because I'm extremely disciplined, you know? And um, I knew that I would like gambling sex, like drink and anything that is enjoyable is, becomes an addiction, right? Because if you're an addict, you want to keep doing it and you can't stop and then you're like in like an AA thing going, I don't know. I just went into the bar to have one drink and the next thing you know, and that's everyone in poker, that's everyone's biggest story. Right. Right there. Like I was up and then like that's why Vegas is there because no one ever saw the type of person that I actually can stop. I know that I can't stop. So I hire someone to come with me to physically make me stop real.

Speaker 4:          01:07:14       Yeah. And I've been doing that since I was 15. You've hired someone to come gamble with you since I have no, not from 15 to 23. I consistently lost every paycheck that you know, and I would be going back from Vegas with that. I don't understand. Like I worked at Toysrus for two months and made a couple hundred dollars and I was like, I went to Vegas and I doubled it, but now I'm leaving with nothing. Like it was that like I had it right, but why didn't I leave with it? Nobody leaves with it and it was just baffling. I was like, you can come to Vegas and when people win money here but nobody ever leaves with it. What is that? What the fuck is that? And it's like the same thing as an alcoholic who like I had a nice buzz going, why did I have to take it to the point where like blacked out and was puking?

Speaker 4:          01:08:04       It's like, cause you can't stop. So I was like, if I can pinpoint if I can know about myself and be honest with myself that I definitely cannot stop. Why don't I just hire someone to stop me? I tell them, look, when I get to this number stopped me and if I keep going, grab me by my throat, picked me up. And so I developed this whole system of like, you know, pulling out and it's uh, it worked for a long time and it actually, it helped like in every aspect of my life. Like, so do you have this guy with you everywhere you go? Well, I did for a long time. You know, he's like, hold on, let me check your balls. You're not ready to come yet. Now. He was awesome. He's a Harry Kim. He was like my partner. We hitchhiked around the whole world together.

Speaker 4:          01:08:51       We did a show on vice where we hitchhiked from like La to Miami, Tijuana to Alaska, Beijing, the Hong Kong. Holy Shit. So I filmed a show doing it. We filmed the show doing it and it's called thumbs up and yeah. I mean, what year did you do this? This was years ago. We probably did the first one seven years ago. Wow. Yeah. So yeah, to answer your question, yeah, I did bring him everywhere with me and, uh, doing that allowed the both of us to like actually never grow up, you know, cause we're like, hey, let's keep fucking, let's keep the party going. And was like, okay, let's just go to Vegas and when 20 grand and we would do it. And you know, that's, that's around the time we met you. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:09:31       And Jill Harris Great. He's like catty, wouldn't you say like, Hey, let me help you. Right. And I'll be watching him gamble and I don't have a stomach for it. Like there's Times David Lucy and thousand 5,000, 10,000. Like I, I just had to walk away by Harry sell discipline and um, he gives them good advice and they worked as a team. So I leave a couple of hours later, they'll come back, they're just pull hundreds of, you know, just bills on the bed.

Speaker 4:          01:09:56       How does that work? They'd tell you can't come and play in the casino anymore. It's not like a, your band. But there they definitely let you know you're not welcome anymore. Like they, they make all kinds of things uncomfortable for you to cow, like a casino that is welcoming to me. Like, and I'm not like some weird like math genius or anything. My, my method like I could explain to you right now how to pull out. Right. Okay. Like you fuck a girl and when it feels good you just pull out like way before you're going to come, you know. So I could sit here and like the shit with me, gambling is a super simple and I actually haven't gambled in the long time cause I don't need to anymore. But basically, um, it's, I could explain it to you, but to actually do it, it's like almost impossible.

Speaker 4:          01:10:41       And I know that too. That's why I have Harry with me. And it's like if you go to Vegas right now because of card counting, because of all these like math nerds and shit blackjack, the most Max maximum bet you could ever bet on black jacket is 25,000. So that's that. That's the end. Yeah. That's the restrict you from going crazy from playing progressive, you know, like basically progressive is if you bet and you lose, you just double it each time so you can just keep doubling forever. Right. If have the bank roll and you'll never lose, right, right. I bet $10 I lose it then. And then once you get it back, you're out. Ben, you start over at $10 a year. Right. You know, and they, they get, they have a, they have a cap at 25 you're always ahead. But I got to a point, I mean Vegas, the Vegas stories I got, I could, you know, there are just like unreal. Like I got to a point where they got rid of that for me. They would let me bet whatever I want. I was betting like a quarter million, a hand on blackjack. So Jesus fucking Christ. What does that feel like in your hands and your feet and your, your spinal cord. The shemale of gambling.

Speaker 1:          01:11:50       It's like, it's like you've done everything,

Speaker 4:          01:11:53       you've done everything and nothing works anymore. Like, you know, you get, you're like, you've done everything, you've done anal and you've gotten the blow job, you know, asked to mouth. You don't ask them about if you've got the aids, you've got everything you need to play it a shit and now you're like, I have like I'm going to have to eat shit. And it's been, and it was progressive. It was like, you know, every time I went to Vegas I would win $1,000 then every time I went to Vegas I won 20 grand and then saw your brain goes, well why couldn't you do it with the same style but with more money? And as long as the casinos kept letting me raise the Max bet, I could keep pushing it harder and harder.

Speaker 1:          01:12:31       And then who you are right now are creating gambling addicts. They're listening to this. Like this guy is smart. I'm smart too. I'm going to go out and make a living gambling. Fuck, walk in here.

Speaker 4:          01:12:42       You have to risk everything. You have to risk everything. Like you're ready. Like you might have to risk like everything you worked for like your whole life. So that you can, when you're, you don't, you can't pussy out. Like if you're going to go for it, then you have to pull the trigger. So how do you change the odds? The odds are that the casino wins 51% of the time. Right? More plus. Plus is it? Plus? What is it? You're not going to, you're not going to take down Vegas. You don't. You're going to just stick the tip in and get a little bit and then it's like bail and then do, it's like, it's like Vegas is Goliath and your list, tiny little speck and you're just taking little nicks out of it. You're not trying to take the house down. How do you keep doing it though?

Speaker 4:          01:13:21       How do you keep putting it on the positive side? I still don't understand how you overcome the 51% is the 51% of mathematical thing because they're dealing with what is the 51 whatever the number is. If people are in correcting, it's the how, three, something like that. It's always, but it's pretty much 50 50 right. Baccarat is I think the best odds of any game because which ones that which ones? I know buck rod is like, you're trying to get to natural nine a natural night. It's, it's Baccarat is like one of the stupidest games ever. It's what James Wall in place. It's the mother fucker. It's, it's, it's the game where when you walk past, it's always Chinese people writing numbers down and screaming and tearing up the cards. Like, but basically it looks the most complicated, but it's like the same thing as them flipping a coin.

Speaker 4:          01:14:08       Like there's nothing you can do, you can't hit, you can't stay. Whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen. You could bet house or you can bet banker. So it's the closest to like a 50 50 kind of bet you can. You can bet. And so basically, like I said, you bet progressive. Every time you lose you just double it. And the second you win it, you just go upstairs, lock it up. And you just do that a couple times and then you leave and you don't want every time Jesus Christ, you don't sit there and you go, oh, I'm trying to like, and you leave when the feeling is the best, like, like breaking it down a sex again is the best feeling after you come. Cause after you come you just want to go to sleep. The best feeling is like when you're about to come, you're like, you feel it coming. You know? I guess coming actually is, I don't know. Cummings over

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       depends on if someone's rubbing your balls are not, is overrated. I think so. Well it's because you're pulling out all the time. Yeah. That's my shit. Loads and chicks. It's a hundred times better. It is like, that's why everybody, we remember when you were young, you were psyched when your girlfriend was on the pill. You're like, oh yeah, no condos bomb blast inside of our, it's the greatest feeling of all times. I'm so much better than pulling out.

Speaker 4:          01:15:20       Yeah, that's, that's true. It's true. I'm so psyched that you fucking have this like unbelievable recall with these fights.

Speaker 1:          01:15:27       Dj One. That fucking fight man. Yeah, that I, well it was very close though. You know the real problem is in judging, there's a, there's an issue in judging. There's an also an issue in the way they're scoring fights at 10 10 point must system. It's like what's a ten eight round? What's a ten seven round? I mean, does it, is it about damage is about knockdowns is about ground control. I mean I just mentioned it to Canada. That's why I was like, hi, Canada's awesome. Hey, how could you say that? We're both band from Canada. It's fucking amazing. It's so fun. Me and Yoshi both can't go to Canada or Japan. Well, you're both. Fuck. I'll tell you what. Canada is this shit. I'm going to Montreal and mark. What are you talking to? Boot. I love it. They talked a little odd, but they're the nicest people on earth, that's for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:16:12       I love it up there, man. I can't, I'm getting booked. I think I'm doing Vancouver in March, booboo, so hang on, hang [inaudible]. Last night at a show. Yeah. Canadians. The shit man. If I left Camp America, I would move to Canada for sure. I would really move to Vancouver if I was not going to live in America. I need to live in Hawaii or Vancouver. I go to Hawaii. Yeah, because Hawaii, Hawaii's not really America. American might own that shit little shit. That's a why and I mean it's just under the umbrella of protection. That is not America. That's Hawaii. That's why a lot of white people go over there and have real problems cause they started tried to treat it like it's the rest of America. Right, right. Instead of treating it like you're moving to a foreign, I don't know. That's its own nation, man.

Speaker 1:          01:16:53       They've got their own shit going on over there. It should be. It should be. You know, it should be like we have like cousin nations, like Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is like, are you, are you planning a, an exodus out of here? I tried to while ago. Man, where were you going to go? I moved to Colorado. I got a house. I leased it instead of buying it just because the check is this manager's like flesh. He says, please just check it out for a little bit. Save your money kid. Right. Saving for a rainy day. You know, I'm like, let's buy a house in the mountains. So it was a on the top of a mountain and my dog got eaten by Mountain Lion. Whoa. Yeah. That'd became a bit in my act. And if you play in the podcast, drinking game drink, shit, it became a bit in my act, but it really, it was true.

Speaker 1:          01:17:33       I really did see a mountain lion in my yard. I was on a, it was a huge piece of land right on the top of the mountain above boulder. You're going to solve a lot of problems with me right now. This when fault. It was, um, well my daughter, my second daughter was conceived up there, so it was about three years ago because I have that fantasy of like, fuck la, fuck the traffic. Fuck this. I just got to get away. But then I realized I fucking hate nature. I have, I don't know how he is a thing. I don't know. To kill a mountain lion, the nature is not the issue. The issue is you have to understand where you're at. You have to understand your environment and you have to have the resources to make your environment compatible to you. You have those resources.

Speaker 1:          01:18:19       You're not like a regular person living in the mountain riding a donkey to work. Right? Okay. So you've got some cash. You could hire someone, apply your fucking driveway, you could hire someone to put motion detector lights on. So if there's mountain lions creeping in your backyard, the lights hit him and they run away. Right? You could, you could protect yourself. So then what happened with you? Why did you, my wife got pregnant. And uh, when you're up in the mountains, it's an extremely high out too. We were at 8,600 feet above sea level and it's hard walking up a flight of stairs, right? And when you get pregnant, it's actually dangerous. It's dangerous to, the fetus is not good. So you're like, fuck, I got to get it out of there. And yeah, and she's not so good at driving in snow or would you go back now?

Speaker 1:          01:18:57       Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. I would live in maybe the city of boulder a lot. I think the city of Boulder's a better mood or was it right in the foothills? Are you from originally? No, I was born in New Jersey and I grew up most of my life in Boston. Okay, so, so what is it you're just done with la? No, it's just that I'm, I love La. There's a lot of la that I love. Here's what I love about La. I think the coolest fucking human beings I've ever met in my life live here. Right. You know, I mean, I just met you today, but I think it's pretty bad ass. Yo. She's cool as fuck. These two guys are okay. All my friends live here except for Stan hope. Like all my favorite comedians live here. Joey D as an Ra should fear and Duncan Trussell and Greg, Eddie Bravo.

Speaker 1:          01:19:41       It's like I know so many people in La that I love that this is where my family is. It's not just where my family of people that I live with, it's my, my family of humans that I love. They're all in la. However, this is a stupid place to stay. And if we can get all the people that I love and everybody was like, listen, I love you. You love me. Let's get the fuck out of here. Right, right. Why don't we have to play to be in a place in this 20 million people on the fucking highway and there's nothing cool to look at. The beautiful thing about Colorado to me was the natural beauty. And that to me is like, it gives me a feeling that like your artwork is awesome. I love your artwork. Beautiful. You're very talented, you're very expressive and you know, just you talking to you as a human being. I love, I love when I meet someone and they're intelligent. And you could see that intelligence expressed in a form of art. And that's why people love art. You know, people love art because like, I can't play music. I don't, I don't, I don't know anything about how to play any instrument at all. So I love music because it's, to me, it's like something I can't do. So I watched it. I'm like, wow, that's amazing. And it's so inspirational, exciting, and I can take it in and almost has as an infant tile level,

Speaker 4:          01:20:51       what does that say about Yoshi? That he doesn't, he's a master. He doesn't listen to music.

Speaker 1:          01:20:54       Neither does Doug. Stan hope. And I love him to death. I love the weird thing, whatever. It's life. But my point was, but well, let me just finish, go full circle with this, is that in Colorado, the natural beauty is so astounding that everywhere you look you're like, ah, oh. Like there was this place that we used to drive. Um, we would go up to this area called Nederland and you drive through the mountains to get there. And as you're driving through the mountains, like you can't even believe you're allowed to be here. You're just seeing the snow covered peaks in these giant dropoffs and fucking trees everywhere. And it's just majestic. And the clouds float overhead and you realize like this is God's country, right? Like you, you are witnessing the, the impact of your environment is substantial. It's the idea that we should only measure things that you could fuck a put on a scale.

Speaker 1:          01:21:45       That's what you're not counting in is the visual benefit you get from seeing art. That's why people buy art or they love art. They love having it there. There's also art in nature and that's, that's reality. If you live in a place that's boring as fuck to look at, right? It's not inspirational. But when you're in Colorado and you're driving, you're driving up Sunshine Canyon. He loves Colorado's driving around. He's fucking trees and mountains that the same thing can be said about northern California, right? If you go like to Humboldt drive around Humboldt drive around the, where the sequoia national forest is, they have these giant redwood trees and he was like, God damn like Tahoe, go to Tahoe, see the fucking mountains, look at all those trees and the look at the giant lake and just say, you take it in

Speaker 4:          01:22:33       Colorado in every spot you just named. I love it too. Like it's I, yeah, it's fucking breathtaking. It's upset. It's just two weeks,

Speaker 1:          01:22:41       two whites, you know, God damn. There's a lot of white people. If you had a dance contest in Colorado, they would call it off. It's just the middle of the night. They would say, no one wins. It's this. It's this completely like,

Speaker 4:          01:22:53       it just makes me, I guess, a little bit uncomfortable, you know? I could totally understand that. That's why I got to Hawaii. It's got the natural beauty and it's diverse enough where that's a good point, you know, and the, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       that's a good point. I could see that. The only problem with Hawaii's, his land, it's locked. It's just like it's a small piece of land. There's not a lot, dude. The volcanoes are an issue only on the big island. Really. I mean, it could look a volcano. The real volcano issue was Yellowstone, and if that mother fucker goes, you're better off being on Hawaii than you are in California. Right. Yellowstone. And it was essentially the pregnancy that got you out of Colorado. Yes. If she wasn't, then you probably stay, I don't know, man. The loser. No, I see. I grew up in Boston, my formative years from 13 to 24. Right. And I, I had a newspaper route when I was a kid when I had a car. Right. And it was, uh, I was fighting in taekwondo tournament's all I did was delivering newspapers in the morning and then in the afternoon and then compete.

Speaker 1:          01:23:53       So I drove every day. Right. So I drove in a lot of snow. Right. So for me, driving in snow, it's just second nature. I knew how to handle that shit. I knew what it's like to get stuck. I got stuck every year, you know, it didn't freak me out. I've walked miles home. Car was in the ditch, you know, because it's spun out on the highway. I've done it, I did all that shit. Right. And when you grow up in a place like Massachusetts, you, you experienced that fucking ruthless weather and you get just, it, just accept it so that, that 10 plus years of my life is in my brain and I just pull that cartridge out and shove it in there. But my wife is from Texas and when she's never driven in snow before and all of a sudden she's like, she doesn't know what the fuck to do when the ass end goes. Right, right, right. No, I know. You got to spin into that shit. You gotta you gotta I know how to balance a car when it starts to slide. And even then you've got to accept the fact that you can't deal with black eyes. He hit black ice. You're going to crash. Right. I have all these things in my head, but to a person who's never grown up in cold weather, that's a terrifying variable that you've just added to the equation.

Speaker 4:          01:24:59       Well, black freeze to death. The black guys get really angry when you try to hit them. That black hat and a black guy, oh, black ice, black ice [inaudible] you've never driven on a uh, like a a road and it rained and it like black guy. I was like, just try to hit black guys in Colorado. Have you ever driven on black ice? No. It's the most terrifying shit ever. You're driving and then all of a sudden the road goes out from under you and you start spinning. Have you ever driven on like a northern road in the winter? No, fucking day. That's the thing, man. That's why I was saying I have this like fantasy of like fucking la and then these visions of like this post apocalyptic like riots and fires and I'm like just get out and then I realize I don't know shit about wilderness and nature and driving learn, learn, all that. That

Speaker 1:          01:25:58       shit you could learn all that shit. The, the, the driving in the snow is difficult, but people have done, they've moved from cow. A lot of people move from California to boulder right after the 94 earthquake. 93 earthquakes. Yeah, that's about right. Whatever it was that big earth, the Northridge earthquake, when your instinct is to go colder, mountainous and I think mine would be to go South America. I, you know, growing up in Boston does I, there's something that I appreciate about cold weather because it gives you a certain respect for the possibilities that mother nature can throw at you. Right. On a regular basis and it sounds ridiculous to one and put yourself through that. All right. And when I was young I s I was mostly was a person who sought comfort, so I wanted to get out of the snow and get out of the all that as much as possible and find a nice place so I could take a nap or it.

Speaker 1:          01:26:44       As I've got older I realized that that is one that's one of the things that sort of steals you as a human being is overcoming adversity and dealing with difficult situations. I think it's, it's good to know that winter's coming. Do you like traveling overseas? Yeah, I don't mind it. I don't like plane flights. I love, I love going to different cultures or plane flights are just such a motherfucker, but I love being in any new cultures. So it's so interesting to me that people can develop, you know, on the same planet in different areas geographically and have completely different sets of values and ideals. And I love comparing their, their takes on family and politics. It's fascinating to me. Endlessly endlessly fascinating to me that we can all exist in 2013 but be very, very, very different. That's why ensign on the podcast last night was talking a lot about Japan, right? We were talking about Japanese culture and why he loves it so much and the Japanese people and how, how well they responded to the Fukushima incident and all those people orderly in line waiting for, you know, for aid. You know, it's crazy. Japanese are the only ones in all of Asia that will wait in line. So disappointed everyone else's

Speaker 5:          01:28:01       because there's a social contract with everyone, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:28:04       And I'm not saying that our culture is socks and their cultures better. I'm not saying that at all. I mean, and people get real nationalistic and really a lot of people had gotten upset with me about a lot of the things that I've said about America on the podcast. And they say a lot of silly shit. I'm not saying, I'm not saying I'm not, I don't believe I believe in, I believe in human. I believe in the concepts of of nations. And in that sense, I love the concept of America more than any nation in the world other than the military industrial complex. Actually,

Speaker 5:          01:28:33       I don't know, remember that when the earthquake was 93 [inaudible] 94 but people surprise me, they were helping each other out planned. I mean, they were amazing. The people that who usually don't like each other, they sit that shit aside and they were helping each other. I was listening to a lecture on this and there's something funny about the complexities of

Speaker 1:          01:28:50       human behavior and emotions and it's like a, it's like, you know, when people are like, hey, how come is it possible? Are we not? Can we not be happy and sad at the same time? Right. Yeah. So the,

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       the earthquake happened, right? Yeah. And it just shook the shit out of my house. Like my cousin almost got flattened by like this giant dresser. And, um, I lived on a street with a lot of old people, so me and my brother went and we went around the block helping all these old people turn off their gas line so that there, there was an old couple trying to find their gas line with, with a lighter on it. And so we went around the whole block and we with the flashlight and then we made sure everyone had their gas line off so that you know, the neighborhood wouldn't explode. And then after that, then we wouldn't looting.

Speaker 1:          01:29:37       I'm on your fucking, that's insurance is for, I'm on your team. You did the right thing for humanity and you took advantage of a disenfranchised situation you found yourself in because of the inequities of the situation that the different system, this is what we operate under, right? And they're going to make lock down. I didn't know that. Yeah. We want to make sure everyone's all right neighborhoods cool. And then go get some fucking dean equities of the situation. You find yourself in a forced you to drastic actions. There's nothing wrong with what you did. You did the right thing humanly. He humanitarian wise with your friends. Yeah. Good for you man. I was listening to a lecture on this very subject today on the way over here. It just coincidentally completely coincidentally and the guy was saying that the um, one of the issues that we have with modern culture and the attitude of modern society, when you watch like the Kardashians show or you watch like nonsensical bullshit on TV or worse yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:30:32       Yeah. And the, the sort of culture of gossip. The reason for that is because we are in a situation where we have massive abundance of resources where everyone can get gas on every corner and you can go to a store of choice, even if you're poor, you can't afford fatty foods. Right? So that, that, that, that, that lack of need for character and lack of need for any sort of real drastic effort to overcome your environment. Like everybody else all over the world allows us to get really fucking conti and really stupid and soft and lazy because we only have to do as much work as we, you know, we need to survival and survival is easy. Then your brain is left to fucking dwell on stupid shit like the Kardashians or like, you know, who wore this dress better or why, why is this guy have a car like that? And I got this piece of Shit,

Speaker 4:          01:31:25       you know, I call it the toilet paper situation. So going back to the Congo, when I was in the Congo, I realized a lot of places they don't have toilet paper. Like even in like just public restroom and stuff. And for those who don't know, I, I need to shit a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:31:40       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:31:42       Like I need to shit all the time. And especially in a country like that where shit is definitely coming.

Speaker 1:          01:31:47       Aye.

Speaker 4:          01:31:49       Well I went to their version of a supermarket, which was just sparse. They had nothing. And I was like, I need that Congo Brazzaville, the city part before I went into the jungle. So I went in and, and you go to the section and you go, where's the toilet paper? And there's a toilet paper, it's just there. And then you're like, okay, it's just a thing of toilet paper when you buy it. And then reflecting later on when I'm here and I go to Ralph's and I'm standing in the aisle of the toilet paper, there's like 50 different brands is to apply for, apply quilted, sent it unscented. And you're just sitting there and I'm like, which one should I get? Like, which one will be feel the best on my asshole,

Speaker 2:          01:32:30       you know? And then

Speaker 4:          01:32:31       the next thing you realize you're like, I just spent like 10 minutes, you know, thinking about something that most people will never have to like think about and you know, like it's, and then you have all this extra time like, yeah, it makes,

Speaker 1:          01:32:41       well that's why people look down on Americans. They look down in Americans is where supposedly at the peak of the abundance pyramid right now we're the most ridiculous as far as our consumption and our attitude towards consumerism and material possessions that we eclipse. We eclipse the rest of the world and our ridiculousness and then as evidence of that we provide to this reality television culture that is sweeping the nation and it's just more and more ridiculous attention focused on people that are completely undeserving of it and well why is that? Why is that coming from America and well most likely because we're the ones with the most guns were the biggest bullies. Whether they're the ones who control them, the the, the military aspect of the majority of the country, the majority of the world rather. And because of that we the people that sit here in the balls of the Dick, that's fucking the world we are, we're weak or we're soft, we're weak bitches.

Speaker 1:          01:33:34       That's why we appreciate character. We appreciate when someone, we appreciate survivorman which used to be like everyday life a hundred years ago. We appreciate the idea that as well, he goes to the fucking jungle for seven days. People live in the jungle all year round. Okay. That's their life. Like we are so weak that like a day without food is what did you do? But that's most of the world has. There's many days where you're not going to find something to eat and you're going to get desperate and then you're going to get some ingenuity together to find something to fucking eat. Right. And that's how people survive to get this far along the evolutionary food chain in the first place. Right. Yoshi, which your ass eating,

Speaker 2:          01:34:16       the reason why you eating ass, cause you don't have to go out there and fish for a living. I mean Yoshi loves salad. You know if you were out there catching salmon all day to try to feed your family in Alaska Souplantation pasta salad, every all you can eat pass other favorite and personally I watched those shows as in Alaska

Speaker 1:          01:34:36       where they di they build fish wheels. It's the these, this is all these shows where these people live in Alaska and they just live off the land and most of them don't have any jobs. They just hunting, farming and catching fish. And then they huddle in for the winter while they developed this thing called a fish wheel and they make it out of logs and it's huge like net, like thing that just spins with the current. It keeps rolling and as it rolls it just scoops fish out of the water and drown them into a bucket. It's really wild. It's ingenious because they invented this up there independently in Alaska hunting well hundreds of years ago, like who knows when the invention of the fish wheel was. Might've been decades, whatever. What the fuck do I know? Alaskan historian? No, but I'm going there with Ari Shaffir. We're going there. This spread. Check this out. Joe Settled Down Anchorage. We're on our way to figuring out how to do this. We're going to do this on the day where you guys have the most salmon, whatever that part of the year is because Ari and I are going to do one show and then go salmon.

Speaker 4:          01:35:37       Definitely figure out when the, like that fishing season is or when it's close to the end because that trip, the vice showed the thumbs up when I hitchhiked from Tijuana to Alaska. When we got to Alaska. This, do you think that they would have hot strippers and Alaska?

Speaker 1:          01:35:53       I would assume that if I was a stripper and I wanted to make some real money and evolves ambitious, I would fly to where there's no checks and that's where Alaska is. This is what her ex or this is what happens in Alaska. Ruthless bitches, these girls, these ruthless bitches that are smart and ambitious and willing to go to

Speaker 4:          01:36:11       place where you could freeze to death. You know these guys, they go out on the boats were months, right? And then they catch all these like crazy fish and crabs and whatever. And then they come back and they get paid like 20 grand cash or whatever. And then what do they do? They go straight to the Strip club. So these girls, they figure it out to go to, you know, a strip club in anchorage or whatever. And so when I went, the chicks are like the hottest chicks ever and none of them are from Alaska. They just flew in for fishing season. Fucking

Speaker 1:          01:36:37       mercenaries. Mercenaries. Oh, I love it. I love that human ingenuity, man. That's figuring out the fish wheel. They, these bitches invented official wheel. They're like, why are we wasting our time in Bismarck, South Dakota? We can't make a Nicole when you can find out Alaska and these motherfuckers have money and they're horny as shit and you just go, how many of those goes turn tricks? Uh,

Speaker 4:          01:36:58       I have no idea. They probably don't have to. Yeah. I mean these guys are like, they're just, they've just been around fish and other men on a little tiny boat for like months

Speaker 1:          01:37:07       jeans on. They probably shoot, right? Yeah. They got those slickers on and they're shooting pants. They were like thick rubber and whatever. I couldn't imagine what it's like to be on a boat from months with a bunch of dudes unless you were gay because the eye for this day. But the idea of no, no sex at all for months and months at a time. Why am I doing this? Oh, because I'm going to catch crabs can get the fuck outta here. I'm not catching it. I don't have that kind of time.

Speaker 4:          01:37:34       Hey Joe, let me ask you. Um, I, I was watching, uh, the DMT experience on Netflix and you were the DMT, the spirit molecule. Yeah. Yeah. So you've done it before. Oh yeah. Like are you done with it or you keep doing it? Um,

Speaker 1:          01:37:50       the real problem, that discussion, okay. Is that DMT is, I did it for the first last year incredibly illegal. And when you start talking about continuing to do it, then people go, well, where are you getting this? Right, right, right. If anybody finds anybody, it just became illegal. Right now it's been illegal for a, was made illegal in the sweeping act of, I think it was 1970 [inaudible] psychedelic sacked. But what's interesting is that five Meo DMT,

Speaker 4:          01:38:18       which is

Speaker 1:          01:38:20       well, just as powerful. I think gram for gram, it's more potent than n and dimethyl tree DMT is dimethyltryptamine this five meo shit used to be legal. We used to buy it on the Internet. He's feel a biologic up bucket of it for like it was, it wasn't that much and you only need like a pinch of that stuff and you get blasted to the center of the university. So while marijuana was illegal or a good order, DMT online, like the first time I did DMT, I did five meo and I did it with a bunch of friends and one of them ordered it online, he ordered it, he brought her over my house and he had like a fucking container, this shit. And we're like, where'd you get this? He goes, I got it online work,

Speaker 1:          01:39:02       you could just buy it online and is it real? And he smoked it and got blasted to the center of the universe. And I was like, okay, am I next? And we all sat around on my couch and I had a remote control for the lights and we would hit it and then there was like four of us in the room. It would hit it. And then, um, when the guy took a hit, boom, I would hit the lights and the lights would go off. And like 10 minutes later the next dude would hit it. Well, it was pretty intense. It was a really a unique experience. How long does it last? No. More than like 10 minutes. Yeah, five minutes. No, I have not done that, but I'm going with the, well, we made plans to go. Dennis Mckenna wants to take, you should take this.

Speaker 1:          01:39:40       Go with you. I'll take you. I want to go. Yo. Dave did it. Where would you do it, Yoshi? If you go out, we'll do. Okay. Were, were you going to let us film it all? Well, you want to be with us. We'll film it. Yes, please. You'll be a part of it. Fun. I had never done drugs my entire life. I'm 36 I had never done it. Might want to come with us. Were you going to go? I don't know. I think we're going to go to Peru. I went to Columbia to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:40:02       Yeah. The the selling point for me was the guy that was like my therapist at the time. It was like, he's like, I could tell you are like, you will have a very short attention span. You get like, you know, bored with things very easily. Like you know, we could make some progress with you just through like normal therapy and this, these kinds of things over the course of years. Or you can have 10 years of psychotherapy and one night where you experience like all these things. And I was like, yeah, what? What does that, and he's told me it was Iowasca so then I went to do it in the jungle in Columbia with him and it was exactly that. I mean it was like completely like life changing and therapeutic

Speaker 1:          01:40:39       Iowasca is a, an elastic active hours.

Speaker 4:          01:40:42       No, it lasted like, well, I had never done anything so it lasted for me more than any of the other, other people there. But yeah, I mean fuck if you took Yoshi all this fucking

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       darkness inside of him, maybe curious age, you know, I know Yoshi, I think Yoshi is a beautiful person. He is a beautiful person. He had some bad circumstances as a young man and he reacted to those circumstances. But outside of that, he's a great guy. But I, when I see Yoshi, I see a guy who was born into a situation that he had no control over and he reacted accordingly. Right? The, the idea of a Iosco being, um, like a one day fix it, it's kind of tricky, right? Because it might not fix you. It might just freaky the fuck out and bring you back to the drawing board and, and cause psychological state instability. Also. I'm really dumb. Can you explain to me like, I don't know exactly what it is. Okay. Um, DMT is dimethyltryptamine and it's the, it's produced in a bunch of different organs.

Speaker 1:          01:41:48       We know that the liver produces it, the lungs produce it. They believe it's also produced by the brain in a gland called the pineal gland. The evidence for that is disputed. It's kind of more anecdotal than anything, but in eastern mysticism, like all of the images of the third eye or that, that is the pineal gland. Like if you see like all these different like um, uh, like deities with the gland, third eye, the chemical I think they say is produced when you dream and then when you're born and when you die. Well, during heavy rem sleep, they believe your brain produces more of it and they also believe that it might be responsible for alien abductions. There's a lot of theories about that because DMT is produced during rem sleep and most of the alien abduction experiences occur at night. And the idea as well, the will, you're saying these people are dreaming but they know it really happened.

Speaker 1:          01:42:48       No, I'm saying it doesn't mean either or just because they're having these crazy fucked up experiences doesn't mean that crazy fucked up experiences isn't a reality. It just might be an ethereal reality and some alternative dimension and it's only accessible through chemicals and that is a possibility. The possibility that everything you experience, look, even if you experience a dream that's profound, it's still an experience. What is happening in that dream that becomes so profound that you sort of see things in a different way. You're having some sort of an experience, you're, you're taking in information, there's no unique ones and Zeros that are entering into your mind that are allowing you to form a new version of the world. Well, the, when the drug experience under DMT, which is again the, or you know, the, the quicker acting form of viral Alaska, the, they know the act of contents and I osca whatever that is, is a very potent experience. Real or not, it's silly to judge, right. The idea that you can't hit it with a hammer, so it's not real. You can't put it on a scale. So it's not real. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:43:54       Measure it with a ruler to me is why it was life changing because I could have a dream and I'll be like, oh, I felt like I just dreamt that I flew. Right. Yeah. But like Joe saying, this thing makes you actually feel like you had just flown like, like, so I'll ask him, make it's the same thing. Well, you know, it's like people say, well, it wasn't real.

Speaker 1:          01:44:14       It doesn't matter. It's exactly the same as if it was real. Let's be very scientific here. Let's say you were having a hallucination and that hallucination lasted one hour and in that one hour, this chemical perturbed your normal sense of visual stimulation and the input to the mind and it gave you a distorted perception of reality, right? And then let's say, um, so let's say that's option a and then let's say option B is you took a magic fairy dust that brought you to an enchanted land that couldn't have possibly been accessed without it. And in that world you communicated with impossibly intelligent entities that broke down the universe for you in a way that you could understand in your brief time there. And then let's look at those two things and say, regardless of which one is true, they both achieve the exact same result.

Speaker 1:          01:45:12       You have the exact same experience, whether it's, whether it's preturbing your sense of visual input to the mind or whether it's you really go to a magic fairy land and communicate with God, right? The same thing happens. You can make noises with your mouth and use the cultural context of written language and historical reference to sort of like put it in a position where you can explain it to a group of people that are not going to make fun of you. But the reality of it is all culture aside, all language aside, all preconceived notions aside, you're having the same fucking experience. So, so it was it life changing for you though? I got a tattoo and I'm like, Whoa, that's a DMT molecule right there. All right. Aside from the Tattoo was nothing. Oh, changed the way I look at the whole universe. Yeah, me too.

Speaker 1:          01:45:59       I sort of understand. Um, after, I mean, I understand first of all that I don't really understand any of it, right. But I understand after I did it that, um, uh, my whole idea of the world that I had used as a reference that I use is like, this is this and this is that and this is the banking system and this is the government. It became ridiculous. It all became ridiculous. And the idea that this could exist and I couldn't know about it. Right. And that could have been living my life. It became infant tile, the whole, the universe became infant, toddler, everything, sex, money, driving it to all be, I mean you're taking the words right out of my mind. Both.

Speaker 4:          01:46:43       I mean it's, it just shows you the ridiculous, it's, it was completely life changing for me. But here's the danger in it I think is when I start going off on him because I didn't get a tattoo of it. But I'm super passionate about about it now because it did like completely like alter my vision of how I see things is I started sound like a maniac when I started talking about it too much to my where and when you start talking about it and get super passionate about it, you don't sound crazy. But then I'm aware of the perception of like, oh people, Dave sounds fucking like a maniac and crazy. And he was talking about this weird drug and then it, and then the thing about it is I did it in Columbia with like 20 other people who are these 20 other people?

Speaker 4:          01:47:28       You know, it was like this trip arranged trip and it's like, it's exactly who you thought they were like weird hippie type people. You know, the fact that this thing exists and that it only attracts these like we're like dreadlocked white people. Fringy people when if the right people did it, basically I think everyone should do it. But if the right people that, that didn't hear it in all, man, that sounds like fucking crazy, like hippy bullshit, you know, it, it could like literally like change the world. Like we could change the consciousness of the whole plan. Really could.

Speaker 1:          01:48:00       And that's that it sounds stupid, especially coming from me because my credibility is limited me to fear factor. And I do cage fighting commentary and then I do a podcast while under the influence of illegal drug. So it's like, look at all those equation. Only illegal federally. Um, why did you have to go to jungle though? Why can't you just cause it's illegal in the United States. I didn't even know that schedule one. It is one of the most illegal drugs in the world along with marijuana, which by the way, the idea of scheduling one is that it has no medical use, which is hilarious because there is medical marijuana approved in California. It's been proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that it helps in a lot of different areas. It helps people with cancer, helps people going through chemo to get their appetite back.

Speaker 1:          01:48:42       And that was people with glaucoma by reducing interocular pressure, it helps people with add the idea that there's no medical benefits of it just because it's not, I mean, and then they make a pill for it. They make fucking that THC pill that they uh, I don't know. Whatever the fuck it's called. I didn't want to say it cause I don't want anybody to buy it. Right. Cause it's horse shit. You know, they make like a synthetic THC pill, which doesn't have nearly the effects of just edible cannabis. That's something that we were talking about before the show where it's like, brownies, fuck you up. They don't just fuck you up because bus, we'd fucks you up. They fuck you up. Because when you eat it, he produces a completely different chemical in your body. You're, when marijuana, when THC is consumed in an edible form, it produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite, right?

Speaker 1:          01:49:32       Which is like five times more psychoactive than THC. Well, I believe it. Yeah. You know why that weird feeling that you get when you eat a Brownie. But I will never forget this man. My friend Brent had a, Brett rather had a Holla, had, uh, a company when he was trying to do, when the medical marijuana movement first started, he had this company who's doing, was making THC pills. Right? And I don't know what he did to fucking get this stuff into a pill form, but he had, this is my strong one and this is my medium one. Or if you're gonna take the medium one, only take one. Right? Like, well, why do you have a strong one? He goes, I don't know. Eddie Bravo takes both of them. He takes, he takes at least if you took two strong, either took two strong ones or two medium ones, whatever he did, I took one right and maybe an hour and a half later I was the most uncomfortable I have ever been in my entire life where I was so terrified of everything.

Speaker 1:          01:50:27       The eye, well, I was looking at people and they became two dimensional, but that was like seeing their souls like peeking behind while they were talking to me. I mean it became like incredibly psychedelic, like way more psychedelic than weed and I didn't understand about the 11 hydroxy metabolite thing then. But I talked to my friend Todd Mccormick who just medical marijuana activist and a professional natural deodorant user at Brown and I'm a brilliant guy, brilliant, brilliant guy. When it comes to medical marijuana, he's, he actually did time. It was like one of the first guys to do time for medical in California because they wouldn't let him use the term medical marijuana even though he was operating under state law or when they bring you to court. Right. Because it's a federal trial, right? You don't even allow you to use the term medical marijuana that term.

Speaker 1:          01:51:19       You can't say it in court. What do you say you'd go to jail. So what do you say? You got to say I grew marijuana and sold it. Oh. And then they say, well, you're a criminal. And then he goes, uh, he said, well, I was operating in the state lost shut up. You can't bring up state law and a federal court. It's an incredible, and he, and he, um, he wound up doing time, but he's the perfect person. He's like, I can always call him. And He, you know, he's a grower so I can call them up. And I go, well, what does that and why, why the fuck am I getting so high? And it goes, oh, you got this, you got to understand. Do you smoke weed everyday? No, but I don't like to do anything every day. I don't think you should do anything every day.

Speaker 1:          01:51:55       But when you do do smoke, I don't smoke weed or any of that stuff. Even eat every day. I like taking days off of eating fast and stuff. Not even fast. I just drink water and take a day off and eating. I've done that before. You know, it's like the ID. Here's my problem with fasting. My same, the same problem I have with healing. Right? You know, like what are you talking about? I'm a healer. Shut the fuck up. You're not a healer. Stop. You might give good massages or not a fucking healer. You crazy bitch. I have his new firm. I was, I just started getting rolfing done. Know what rolfing done. It's like super painful, deep tissue massage. And I, uh, I read a bunch of different websites. I was looking for someone that does w Rolfing, the La area, and I read this one lady's bio and it was like, I always knew from the moment I was a child that I had natural healing and this is what I'm talking about, Joe, all this shit that like you, like, that's good shit, but only attracts like weird NATO's.

Speaker 1:          01:52:50       Yeah. Well, because you know, there's a lot of fuckery in the world. There's a lot of fuckery psychics. You at least jerk off everyday though, right? Me Or you take days off. I'm taking, I've taken many days off. I never take it no more than 30 in a row, but I'm a hard worker when it comes to that. I did that once for a website project. What, how, how has the longest it took 30 days off. Well, it was ridiculous. We just like leaking everywhere. I was getting bonus from hugs, hugs full on boner. Boner hubs are pretty fantastic. It was amazing. I was like, wow. Am when I first came to La, I uh, I had a girlfriend in New York and uh, we, uh, we were kind of like on the outs when I first moved to La and I was figuring out whether or not I should move her in with me and bring her out here and whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:53:34       And I was out here working on a TV show for like two weeks and with by myself living in the Oak Woods apartment complex and I was on the set and this girl, she said something the girl was working with and we laughed and she said, Oh, give me a hug, and she gave me this big giant hug and you came in through her belly button. Nah, man, I, I got her pregnant. I just, the hug felt so good. I was like, I got, I was like, I was at, I was on empty and I pulled into the gas station and she filled me out. By then I realized like as a human being at that point in my, I was like in my twenties I was still pretty fucking stupid, but I realize as a human being that the human touch is, it's not just a luxury that it's a staple.

Speaker 1:          01:54:19       It's a staple for a mental management and then if you don't have someone in your life, you don't have loving people in your life. It's not a, it's not a I inconvenience. Convenience. It's like it's unhealthy. It's bad for your body. It's, there's a, there was a, there was something going on. And again, and what, you can't measure it in the fucking milligrams of vitamin C or Caffeine or alcohol there, but there was a reaction in my body that was very real. When that girl hugged me, I felt so much better. And I'll never forget that because I'm like, okay, well I have to realize that this is a real, this is something isn't one more thing that we can't measure in conventional terms, but that it actually exists and it's tangible and it's a fact. Well, I mean, I come from a family of huge hookers, like, that's awesome. I parents hug the shit out of me. That's very unusual. My Dad kisses me on my mouth. That's beautiful. Uh, no tongue or tongue, sometimes a little bit of tone, especially after whiskey breath. Right. And then in the time that I met Yoshi, you know, have you ever tried like, you know, I hug all my friends. This is the most awkward guy ever. He's like, Yo, shell the title. But he's like,

Speaker 3:          01:55:29       alright, alright.

Speaker 1:          01:55:40       Jesus, that lazy gentleman was a gas moment in our podcast. Just came in his pants and we've had gay be blond. We had gay people on confirmed. You know what? I don't think we have. You make so much more sense then we need to get a a gay representation. Oh, by the way, we're going to have Melissa Etheridge on the podcast. Whoa. Yeah. Melissa Ashridge actually asked to be on the podcast. Publicists content out. I hope she doesn't yell at me for my cartoonish portrayal of lesbian. That's fine. This isn't punishment. I hope she actually likes it. I like it as beans. She might not be. This might not be a friendly visit. I'm just kidding, but we need more gay representation on this podcast. She's gay. She's a lesbian. It's different.

Speaker 1:          01:56:27       I always trip on the word gay. Anyway, look at all uncomfortable. It looks good. It looks like you just check to see if he has a boner. You guys chose Yo. She's good man. No, he's a great guy. He's just very awkward with human [inaudible]. She had an awkward awkward, just not me, but that's not a very common thing in Japan. You don't talk about Asians don't have your, your reality, your situation like your family, like you don't want to talk about though. I talked to him. Everything you tell everybody in the whole story what you did and why you can't go back to Japan. No, I could go back. I just can't get out. You can't get out once you go back. I would imagine so. There's probably why that there's probably like a criminal record tell. It's a little different because tell everybody what happened if you want it to you. I mean this is an interesting story. The best story ever. Well, if you want to listen, not a problem at all. Okay. That's the only reason why I brought this up is because I know you're pretty adamant about expressing yourself all the time.

Speaker 5:          01:57:23       I will say before I finished, I started the story that uh, Dave, what's the rest are in Japan September of 2003 in the same week I was in jail in La County. So I guess we were meant to meet each other, but they are part of 10 years ago. Set this coming September, we're in jail. Oh, someone sounds like

Speaker 1:          01:57:39       stalker. That's exactly what I would send an email if I was trying to get them to get me pregnant. So what's your, tell us your story.

Speaker 5:          01:57:50       So I got an email in August, 2003 from my cousin. Basically my writing skill in Japanese isn't that good. So he wrote it in English. He basically could roll pop up dead. That's a nice one. Dead. My father was dead, but they didn't know how to write in English. So that's the only thing they will. And I called them and find out my dad supposedly killed himself. So wedding couple of days I flew back to Japan and find out what happened because I saw him six months before, early 2003. Um, I find out that my step mother was cheating on my dad before marriage, during marriage. And they're trying to, they're in process getting divorced, but my dad killed himself later one. We don't know for sure. He commit suicide or my step have something to do with his death. We don't know. But, um, during the funeral I still, my step mother killed.

Speaker 5:          01:58:38       You think she killed? I think so. Why do you think that? The more I hear the story, she sounds like the most, like my cousins, older brother in Korea, she was living in Korea. My stepmother, so my cousins, older brother lives in Korea, their version FBI, they checked the background and my stepmother flew in the day before. The last time they saw my dad alive. Doesn't mean that he killed her, but that she lied. She killed him. Yeah. She said that she was in Japan the whole time and we find out later why she lied. She lied about that. Well, she lied about that. That's that, that kind of guilt lying about where you were very suspicious. Yeah. So it doesn't mean she did it die. How did he die? Um, hanging. So I went to police station, saw the picture, and he was in the hot sun for like two weeks.

Speaker 5:          01:59:25       So he was dark. I mean, he looked like he was hanging outside, inside, but that summertime, Japan is so hot and humid, a decomposing. This is, this is how I met Yoshi told us. What was the joke? It was the darkest joke I've ever heard in my life. What did I say? Hi. I'm a little high. You're a little [inaudible] told the joke. It's so fun. It's not a joke. I just say, you know, he was darker than a nigger or whatever, but oh yo, that is not a dark joke or even a good one. But the racial slurs darker than Bobby Lee's balls. Yes. So Bobby Lehan dark balls, black balls. The, I can't have, I can't approve that. That joke. Do you don't say that on stage do. Yeah, he did. He did. I was like, this guy's crazy. He's like, that's ridiculous. That's how you ended your act or something.

Speaker 5:          02:00:13       That's a good way to get your ass kicked. Not yet. But um, but basically he had been hanging and he turned black, so he was hanging and basically the heat of the house just kind of slowly cooked him. Yeah. I mean, I saw the picture, the cop told me, I highly recommend you don't look at the picture, but I needed to see, you know, because after his death, my family farm, he told me that all the horrible things that we were have. So do you think that she could have possibly driven him to do that? That for sure. 100% yeah. Yeah. She lived hundreds of thousands of dead. And He, she told my dad that she brought one of her cousin from Korea. We laid on find out it was her, her the whole time. So while my dad was working, she was fucking this guy pretending to be her cousin, whatever.

Speaker 5:          02:00:58       Just the whole humiliation debt and all this stuff. And like, was she younger? 10 years younger, but this, are you sure she wasn't just fucking her cousin. This is why a guy like David should be afraid of marriage. Okay. Never ever, never fuck someone where you're confused as to why they're fucking you or never. But then the reality is, and the natural law world, you shouldn't get laid. Brian, you should get your shit together first. But so, so, so that happens when you do that man, people start to resent. You ever see like a famous dude with a trophy wife and the trophy wife fucking hates being there, you know? And you see that, that that's uh, that's a sketchy

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       situation. Yeah. I watched this dude and a watched his wife yelled at him and shit and he's like, uh, like this sort of minuscule famous guy. He's a small guy and the wife was yelling at him, giving him a hard time and he had just, he just absorbed it and dealt with it and it was really, it really fucked me up cause this guy's really famous and I was doing, man, why are you in this prison abuse you, this is fucking shitty person in your life is treating you like that. Why? Because she's not impressed with you. Like what is it? I'll tell you why some people wait a hundred and fucking 30 pounds and she was six foot tall and hot as fuck and she really wanted to get fucked by giant black guy. Mandingo giant Mandingo or cause and maybe like when a guy, when the guy is an old guy and he's got this hot young chippy and there was no washes with them. Yeah. She's fucking stealing from you man. Yeah. So what happened?

Speaker 5:          02:02:37       So I went back to the funeral and um, somehow she was, she didn't know my temperament because my dad's a very kind and nice person. He's never hit me before, but I have temperament from my mother. She was, you know, she was typical Korean women varies, uh, aggressive, you know. So I caught her at the funeral by herself, uh, preparing to funeral thing for my dad. Right. It was like way up a hill. Yeah. Way Up in the hill, rest of the family of down the hill and parking lot. They didn't know what's going on. So basically I went up there with my aunt and my aunt's soul, my stepmother, and she goes, you kill my fucking brother. You fucking bitch. He leaves. It was me and her and everyone knows at this point that she was cheating on him the whole time. Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:03:15       Everybody knows that. She though this all. She even tried to poison my dad. So next thing you know, she tried to poison. They took the sample way in all those Korean dish, Kimchi or whatever she brought from Korea. My Dad kept getting sick so they took all the food from refrigerator at some medical lab. They check and there was a poison in a dish when your stomach is poisoning his Kimchi and hitting on and cheating on him and the whole family knows and she has the fucking balls to go to the funeral. When she was playing this thing, she didn't know anything about me and her older sister has a reputation of Marion, bunch of guy and they all tie in a mysterious circumstances, have a history. They have a history of that. Her older sister does this fucking thing. This sounds like it's crazy.

Speaker 5:          02:03:59       It's fucking insane. So my aunts are, you fucking beg you kill my brother. She left and then 10 seconds later I just started running over and just beating the shit out of her and I grabbed back of her head and start punching their face for a long time and put her in. She's unconscious. No, but she was shocked because she didn't know I had an inmate to do that and I was a little surprised because I didn't plan to do that. I was angry, but I didn't take, she was dumb enough to be separated by the rest of her family, but she was arrest. Gosh, who? She was by herself. You are by herself. No one's anywhere near that. No one near. And instead of grabbing her back of her head and just started beating her face in stop and uh, put on her ground and it's not stumping be turning or legs, eyeball was dumped.

Speaker 5:          02:04:37       Her Pussy. Yeah, stomach and her face, her eyeball is about to come out. I was stamping her face like I have to five or six times. I heard some lady that work at the cemetery scream, that's when I kinda just stomping on this lady and started screaming. So how much damage did you do to her? I think if I did it, like my cousin called me and like week later and he was actually, he was laughing on the phone like, yeah, if you did it for another menu, probably killed her, whatever. She ended up going to hospital for like two and a half, three months, but that's snapped him out of it. The lady screaming. So then he ran back down the hill. That's true. And then like, like everyone's like what the fuck's going on? And he like grabbed his cousin's car keys. No, no, no.

Speaker 5:          02:05:15       Yes. I went down and uh, my stepmother's nephew was walking up the stairs. He didn't know what's going on. So I started coming down and he doesn't know what's going on. And so I figured by then I already beat one person. What difference does it make if I, so his guy goes, people, this funeral was, how long after Japan? Why like when you got off the plane and went straight to the funeral, right? A day after? Yeah. So this guy gets the Japan, goes to a funeral and then just starts punching people and then like, so you attacked him as well? For what reason? Just because I feel related to her, related to her and like what difference does it make if I think everybody at this point? Yeah. It's like porn stars. Like what difference does it make you feel? What? Fuck one hooker or 500 at once you do one. It's really interesting that you're using attempted murder and connecting it to gang bang. Oh, Yoshi kills hookers all the time now and kills him with his aides.

Speaker 5:          02:06:10       So the animal ate at a boy. So I went down the stairs, I saw him, I sucker punch him. He doesn't know what's going on. Oh my God. And there was a little, uh, you feel bad for that? No, not at all. But he, I wish I want to do with it. I know I was just angry with her and her family. Right. But I mean, her family is just people. Yeah. You know, I mean, you don't feel bad fat of poisoning poisonous Pete. Well, you know, I mean maybe they don't know what the fuck the sister and her dad at the time. I didn't, I wasn't really rationale. It was just so I sucker punching. He went down and most of these eight, I'm six foot one. Most of these people are like five one five, two. So even though I'm not a physically imposing in America, I'm pretty big in Japan.

Speaker 5:          02:06:52       You're kicking ass in jail. Um, Anderson Silva when it comes to fighting and beating up old women, but so how old was she when you did this to her? 55 or something. Oh, Holy Shit. She killed his dad, man. Oh, I understand. Listen, there's no [inaudible] I lost my fucking mind. Listen, I would have killed her. I, if I, if I'm stomping on a check for five times, she's dead. I don't know how the fuck your pussy stomps allowed her to live. So he knocks the, knocks the nephew out. I got this little is not something to joke about, by the way, ladies and gentlemen. You're right. If your outrage listening to this, you're like, I can't believe he just got that little mallet where Buddhist scope to water to clean that cemetery. I grabbed that stuff, just beat him one. But they had a couple of times ran down the parking lot and it's so the my stepmother's older sister and her and her husband and then I started s sucker punch him too.

Speaker 5:          02:07:42       It's punching everybody. Yeah. Punchbowl endurance at this point. You're getting winded. Yeah. I wish I would have stretched before that fight, but I didn't plan, it wasn't planning itself. I don't know anything by my short, I don't know any of that stuff. It was unplanned was beat all these people. But how do you get out of the country? Uh, like Syria. My Shit, Mike, my aunt Yoshi, she's the only one when he started finding me back, she's the one, she had a cancer brain cancer actually, but she's the one that, you know, uh, interrupt a fight, sub punching him and just told me to leave. And I told my cousin dragged me out of there and he wasn't sure cause he went to, so you punched them too? No, no, no, no. If I think he hesitated because he doesn't want to a somebody who did criminal acts, but he's smaller than I am.

Speaker 5:          02:08:29       So if you don't think I'm going to beat the shit out of it. Well we got in his car, he's dry me out of there and I went to all second international. He just got to Japan. Yeah, like a day before. And then he went and beat everyone up and then he's hiding. You got right to the airport? I grabbed his cell phone and call the airlines, changed my flight. I'm praying there's another flight within four hours and there just happened to be one in four hours. So I went over there. But that was the longest full hours airport because I figure she'll call the police what happened had they not call the police. It never even occurred to them because they were so worried about her. They went to hospital, whether it probably didn't know where you went. They figured out. They figured out was hiding somebody, one of my cousin's house.

Speaker 5:          02:09:06       Do you think that they knew that she was guilty too, or everybody knows? She said, how did you find out it was your aunt that told you, right? Yeah. It was her trying to poison him. Huh? Yeah. Your aunt told you, what did she say? They have a medical record in this whole time. Yeah, but it doesn't mean she tried to kill him. Oh No. She tried to kill him because of the poisoning though. That's pretty definitive. Yeah. And they had a medical lab. Uh, I don't know how they figured out poisoned, but they took it to lab. Ever Eat Kimchi at Yoshi, his house, he keeps his daddy's Kimchi in general is pretty strong and I love Kimchi, Kimchi at Yoshi cells and it tastes a little weird. Don't eat that shit. Damn Dude. So you escaped Japan? Yeah. And the other criminal charges pressed against you.

Speaker 5:          02:09:48       Here's a weird thing. Mostly comps in Japan doing or be a part of like family dispute with technical. She's still my family. So whenever there's a family at each birthday, rather, there's even a fucking head stomping. Well, generally speaking, but, um, I don't want to go back to Japan to find out. So remember you, and I think Jody's, it does ask me and like the goal, but you're in translate. I would love to do it, but I was little war. Maybe soon as I land, there's a wrecker of it and put me in jail. They could be right. There might be, but most likely I can't get out. Dave cannot get in. Those are two different things. Can you not get in? I went to jail. There are a few years ago. What'd you go to jail, therefore I beat up a undercover security guard. What happened? Well, it's sort of, it's sort of like Yoshi said, I'm not a huge

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       guy over here, but over there, like I'm sort of the Anderson Silva of what happened over there. Uh, you know, it's,

Speaker 4:          02:10:42       I could talk about this for like hours and hours, but basically I, I in much of the same way where I helped, uh, you know, the old people dinner during the earthquake, turn their gas off and then went looting, like have a, you know, I had a troubled past where, you know, beef, this is before I got like seriously into gambling. Like I spent most of my childhood just like, just like fighting and getting into all kinds of trouble and doing like small time criminal kind of activities and stuff. And so when I went to Japan where it was like the society based on like honor and like, you know, the light turns red and then everyone stops walking. And I was like, Whoa, this is fucking crazy. Like they like don't even have locks on their bicycles because who would steal a bike that's not your property? Like it's crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:11:28       Like you could literally go to Japan and just get on someone's biking. Just, I was like, this is fucking nuts. So that's what I did. I'd go to Japan, I'd steal some guy's bike and I'd go out all night, spray painting graffiti on everything cause like, and I would just do it in broad daylight, like no one would stop me, you know? And then at the end of the day I just go bring the bike back. And so, you know, my art was getting a lot of recognition out there at the time. So I was going out there like once a year, twice a year,

Speaker 2:          02:11:53       no stealing bikes, stealing bikes through graffiti, stealing shit. Like just, just causing, you know, damage and chaos in general. Right. So, yeah, I mean

Speaker 6:          02:12:05       is, that's one thing when we were in Japan, uh, some, some guide was telling me about like the same kind of thing. Like you could tell these girls anything, they'll believe you cause more lies to them. So like you can tell him like that you're super famous rock stars and it kind of felt bad about it, you know, like you felt

Speaker 2:          02:12:19       after Brian's fifth stories, I'm not really iron man. Wow. So you got arrested for doing well? Yeah, I mean

Speaker 4:          02:12:31       definitely deserved. I mean it was the best thing that could happened to me. My life in general was getting out of control and going to jail was probably the best thing.

You're not sure. You can't show pornographic images and a video iPod thing. Easily hybrid of all of Yo, she's bought wholesale. It's, yeah, no, don't show yo she's home because it's just too tempting. Again, like his gay porn or it's training and stuff. It might drag you over to the dark side. Yo, she would tempt you with this black hole of butthole.

Speaker 4:          02:14:16       Well, you guys are filming. You guys are filming this whole show, right? On our podcast we have one camera and it's just pointed at Oscars. Pussy. That's hilarious. It's like you want to see how did you, how did you meet her? How did you guys become friends? This guy, he just became my buddy. Well it's, it's like the thing you were saying about the cock hold and like watching black guys, like I've talked about this before, but basically if you're a guy and your Asian, the only place you are in American porn is, is gay and the bottom, there's not one Asian male porn star in straight porn. So just the one now except for one now, which was that movie. So after I got to know Yoshi and you know, knowing what a degenerate he is, he's like, hey Dave, they're filming the first Asian American porn where the whole cast is Asian.

Speaker 4:          02:15:04       And I was like, Whoa, that's pretty like groundbreaking, you know, there's no like, like it's gay to know what I guess when you jerk off to porn, like I've watched so much porn, I could recognize the guy's penis now about that. Yeah. That's pretty North Homo. Exactly. Exactly. And you know, you seen, there's not that many guys, so you start to recognize the guys. Yeah. So can you name a Asian male porn star? Yeah, there isn't any. Right. So Yoshi told me about it and then we went, yeah, we went, I went to the set of the, the first and it was, it was based on a weird Japanese poet or someone, some chick that like cuts off her lover's penis or something. It was very hard. Yeah. Fist to the nuts star and also was the star in that. So we hit it off right away.

Speaker 4:          02:15:50       And uh, yeah, that's how I met also through Yoshi. And that was like the first time that was the first, like she just got married. Yeah. She just got married. Dude, trust me. That's all I kind of a deal is that well, it's to another porn star. Yeah. So, uh, okay. But, uh, you know, she was the, she was one of the first like women that I met that I was like genuinely interested in after my seven year long relationship. So I met her on that set. And then I'm like, this chick is fucking Rad. Like she'll just like talk about anything and how she has to like wash your butthole out and it's just like not in a gross way and it's very to meet

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       someone that's like so open and honest about everything. She's very funny too.

Speaker 1:          02:16:34       Synchronicity and the, the, the word DVD asa when you're doing a show with asa. Akira.

Speaker 2:          02:16:40       Yeah. Well, I mean it sounds like David and asa phonetically, phonetically, but it's actual double, double, double anal census sensitive artists.

Speaker 2:          02:17:14       The story of how you first met, um, Yoshi is one of my favorite stories. I think it was on the first episode of DVD Essay and just your, your how you do his voice isn't first nation, so it makes the story so much better. So we're going to bring you out of this,

Speaker 1:          02:17:28       but prepare for a fucking avalanche of a hate mail from people don't like dude stomp and women a death, especially when they're in their 50 [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:17:36       Honestly, if anyone out there wants to sit here and judge Yoshi, think about if there was a person out there that like did your family wrong and what you would do to them, especially kill your dad. Yeah. I mean you don't know if she did, but at the very least she tried the very least. She tried to poison. But then here's the flip side of that. Are You mad at your dad for like allowing a woman like that? The power, I was really angry with him. Do you think like, yeah, I mean he goes, well, you're doing

They're so fun to do. And it's one of the best comedy environments on the planet Earth. It's a club that's been around since 1960 and it's just like, I can't say enough good things about the staff or the the owner Bob. He's the coolest motherfucker ever. And to me it's really important to support places like this because they're very fragile. It's not a lot of money and owning a comedy club. And I want to help these people that think about bailing out. All right, I've got a desk, squad.tv and you can pick up one of these fucking Badass tee shirts designed by our very own prion and there's two different versions of it.
