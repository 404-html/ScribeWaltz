Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Herbs and they moved shit around and put things in weird places and when you read the translation like what the fuck does this mean? Well they're figuring out how to translate it. Not just both word for word, but figuring out how you would say that same sentence in English structure as well. Yeah. So it's clear what you know, what you're translating. It's fucking fascinating shit man. It's fascinating. And I also

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       wonder after, you know, 50 or so years of everybody using English on the Internet, how many kids are gonna grow up just as English as their, you know, their new language and the original languages, like the old fashioned thing their parents did.

Speaker 1:          00:00:34       Could you imagine if there was only one language, could you imagine how much shit would get done? Can you, you know what's interesting though, when you say that, like imagine languages are going to go away by technology. Very, very, very fast. Old Languages. Well, so what's going to happen? Like translate on motto, like you have to sit there and have something translated to you in pr in real time. You know it's going to be voice detection and everything like that, so it's going to make language. Languages though people are still gonna want a traditionalist, so we'll still be there playing with their whole thing. But what if a few generations go by, right? I think things are going to change. Well, you're a proponent of the isolation tank. You actually have. John Lilly's tank don't do actually is pretty cool. I met John. He gave me his tanks.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       You and my only other friend that ever had one that's having Willie mays is fucking baseball bat, you know, it's cool. I've got to shower shoes to go with it. Oh, I actually get out and walk and issues. Every time I go from my high heels are pretty boring. Brown shower shoes. But imagine when they figure out how to stimulate the mind to create certain states and they do it in conjunction with the tank, which is really the way to do it because it eliminates all the sensory input from this world. If they could figure out how to do that, put some electrodes on your head and set you and that fucking tank and light you up like a Christmas tree and you just go into some other world, then maybe people will stop. I think Dr Lilly did that to me with one CC ketamine injected, you know? Yeah. You told me about that. What a rush. What did he do exactly?

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       Well, when I got there, actually they, I was going to go into the tank just straight and um, when I got to rinse off and everything before you go in the tank and the guy was prepping me and he says, you know, usually when we do it, we go in with one CC, injected in a muscularly, you know, ketamine, you know, would you like some? And I hear part of my brain go, no, no drugs. Thanks. And then I hear my mouth go, oh, absolutely. I'd love some. And then I, I felt like a complete third person in my own reality because he said, no problem, you know, it's injected into muscularly. Is that a problem in my side of my brain went needles? No, my mouth, however went, no problem. That'd be great. You want to friend them and, and you know, and I, and he walked away to go get me this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:02:47       And I stood there for a minute and my brain was saying no way. And my other side of my brain went, look, you're a doctor. Lily's house, man, you've come all this way. There's no way you're saying no. And uh, he walked back in and I felt a little alcohol swab and my muscle and I heard my brand go no. And then I heard my mouth go. Thank you very much. And uh, and then, uh, I made the most naive. Sorry, sorry. How long does it take to kick in? And I will never forget his face when he went, oh, you haven't done it before. Oh, you should lay down about 45 seconds a, any like put me in the deck. And uh, when you do it, what if you do something like that? You have sleep apnea. Do you run the risk of like choking and not.

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       And not breathing, uh, I don't know, I didn't have slept sleep apnea, but the last thing I was thinking about was sleeping when he slipped me into that tank. I thought I was there to watch the entire world coming to an end. And um, I had a ringside seat was pretty interesting. So they shot you up with is ketamine, you lie down on the tank and into the tank and you float. And for me it was the first experience ever float. And then when you first experienced floating was with ketamine, you know, how do you say no to Dr Lilly? You know, I'd watched the movie altered states dozens of times. I'd own the laser disc. That's how it happened. What happened after you? After you, it kicks in 45 seconds. I thought I was freaking out and I'm, the funnier side of this was my good friend was in the, in the other room and I was background noise while all this was going on.

Speaker 2:          00:04:16       And he didn't know about the ketamine entering into the equation. And he was sitting there with Dr Lillian, his assistant at the time, Craig. And um, they had no concern of me like sounding like I'm drowning. And finally he asked, you know, did, is he on Ketamine? And uh, and Craig said yes. And he said, would you go get me some? And my friend was totally blown away. I didn't think that was going to be the answer to the, to the problem. And John put some ketamine into his leg and told my friend to have a nice night. And he went into his bedroom and my friend could see into the bedroom where the tank was next to a bed and he didn't touch the tank. He just went in and laid down next to the bed. And I actually stopped screaming at that point. And my friend was looking in, the bedroom was screaming.

Speaker 2:          00:04:58       I was freaking out, man, I'm losing my mind. So you're in the tank, you pan it, you start screaming, John Lilly says, I'll send me some of what he's having. Yeah. And honestly for me, I felt like a, well when I stopped screaming, I remembered it was conscious. I, I, it felt like somebody came into my trip and just said, Yo, take a deep breath, calm down, and, and I was like, okay, and uh, and you know what? I just channeled the energy and it actually was a really positive experience. John Lilly joined you and your trip. What if he joined you in the actual isolated did it? Me and my girlfriend later on tried to get it. It's like that dentist, not a cool place for to have a friend Sasha here. Let's cuddle. It didn't work, but you know what? In a sense, yes. I feel like he did. I felt like there was a telepathic communication as much as this is going to blow all of the credibility I just had about talking about pot. Yeah. I actually felt like Dr. Liliana communicated on a level that was more telepathic during

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       the time I was under the drug. Do you think like the tank even horror story? Don't want to believe it. I don't even work though. If he took the same amount of pills and just lay down or something. The tank that no, no pill or I wouldn't think that your involvement with the tanks, you know, here's how Mckenna described ketamine. He said that it was like you. He believed that when you did psychedelics, you somehow or another connected to the experience that everybody had had doing those psychedelics before you. That's one of the reasons why the mushroom experience so rich and diverse. It says some thousands and millions of people over the years have done mushrooms and you're connected to this one big gigantic growing experience. He said, doing ketamine. He said Ketamine is so much more rare. That really it gave him the feeling like he was in an abandoned warehouse or an office building with no furniture in it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       That's interesting. Yeah. You said was very alone in my trip initially and then when I felt like there was another energy around me, I, I. It did feel different and it was weird. I had a long conversation with John Lilly after and he really, he was. I really liked the old guy who was really a nice guy and then afterwards when I left, whatever, the next day his assistant showed them, said, you made a real impression on John. He'd like you to have his tank. He just gave it to you. Yeah, that's crazy. You probably felt bad. He probably didn't want you to sue them for fucking whacking them with ketamine and throwing them into a fucking bathtub. He's like, this dude might sue me. It was going to work this. I'm going to work this on the stroke it. I'm going to call them up until Yo, man, you, you are the shit.

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       I don't want to give you my take. You know? Oliver Stone went the night before me and his tank and a 400 vps in the shit over stones. A big pooper. Never really thought about that until just this minute. I would have definitely ended up into those. Yeah, we both did it. Yeah. We got to talk about it. Years later, him and I sit down and chat about a weekend at John's. Wow. What a fucking freaky dude. John blow out with her with a special k and throw him into a fucking pink of water. Do No, this is the guy that the day of the Dolphin was made about. He's the guy that did all of the research books. All of them. He's a bad motherfucker. He was awesome. He's got a great book where he actually shows it's got the deep self, has directions on how to make a tank.

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       Shows you how to make that precursor. The son of Mario Tech. I got, isn't it Santa Maria is somebody's son. Somebody's. Yeah. That's what I had to. I had one of those as well. Now I got a float lab one. The new. A crazy version of or showed you that? Not yet in the basement. The trip. Fucking. It's the craziest thing. I think they're awesome. You know, and I think a lot of people have never really been able to meditate within themselves. And when you get into this tank and there's no resistance on your body and you can actually get really here and you don't really see and you feel the same temperature as the surroundings around you, you really field so boundless and it's, it's truly flying through space. You flying a spaceship, man, that is a portal to another world. It really is. It really is how to relax.

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       Once you learn how to relax and it takes a few times. You have to do it a bunch of times and depending on your personality, how good you are truly letting go. But if you really learn how to let go, man, you go on trips in that thing. I used to, I used to set an alarm at like 4:00 AM. If I went to sleep before midnight and I just walk because I had mine in my bedroom. I've walked right into my tank, back in it and like go back to sleep and like four or five, 6:00, I would always wake up before seven, feeling like, man, I had just slept for so long and I felt great. And night dreams would be so lucid, so incredibly real and tangible in a holy shit. I want to go write them down loose. That's intense. So you only walk a couple steps.

Speaker 1:          00:09:29       Barely woke up. I barely up right back. Right back out. Got It. It's awesome minds too far from our fucking bird and the walking. I'd wake up going, oh, what the fuck you doing with your life Rogan kit number 4:00 in the morning. You fucking were to go meditate. And then I'll go on the internet and check my twitter follows the congress is what's going on here. It will be an hour later. I'd be like, I'm going to get some breakfast, man. I'm fucking hungry. Except in coffee. Did you see that shit that was on CNN? But are these, these uh, all these former US air force and penalties are coming out about Ufo shows around nuclear on nuclear facilities. That's fucking trippy shit man. I wonder if these guys are all just nuts. I wonder if these guys are all kooks or if feel like disinformation guys that work for the government.

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       The government wants us to think there's fucking really ufos thing, just distracted. Meanwhile, Obama's passing on his legislation, making it any easier for people to wire, tap your emails and get into your fucking twitter account, your facebook pages, and they're passing all this legislation right under everybody's nose. I wonder if that's what it is. I wonder if it's still so distraction tactic. I truly believe it is. I mean they appointed the UN, appointed some chick to be the ambassador when the aliens come. Listen Bitch. You don't speak from. Is that real? Okay? Yes. The you can just at points. Just sit around and wait. She is a, I believe she's an astrophysicist and her job is to communicate with the aliens. You don't talk for me. Hooker. Can I just say something? I got a dog. We have been on this planet evolving with dogs for thousands of years and we don't speak Doberman.

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       We don't speak German shepherd and how do we think that they're going to show up and suddenly we're going to be like sit good alien up, up your idea and they want a snack. Is that they're going to be so much more intelligent than us. They're going to be able to understand what our language is. They'll be able to decipher our language. That's the hope and the dream. I think they're going to show up and think, food, man. You look soft and juicy. Well, what we do is if you look these people, if you look at what you look at, what do they appreciate us? We'd be like cows. You know? If you look at what every single intelligent life form on this planet does, they're gonna. Make sure that they explored everything weaker than that. That's the ethic of space. It seems like there's the ethic of life on this earth, on this planet is survival of the fittest. It's

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       and when you're the fitness, you get to fuck the ones who are not as fit. That's just the way it is. Why human beings do to dolphins and sea world and what we do to killer whales. We know the killer whales rescue human beings that fall off boats. We know that there's never been a case in the wild of a killer whale documented case. Killing a human, the only time they've ever done it then see, well, that's the only time I've ever done it is in capital. And we know what dolphins do. Dolphins killed baby dolphin so that they can force the female dolphins. Dolphins are ruthless. Is that true as fuck as true, that they killed the baby hill? The babies, how do they kill them? Kill Them. Their face. Are they kill them? Yeah. And that's one of the reasons. Yeah, the dolphins raped the fuck out of each other too.

Speaker 3:          00:12:32       And one of the reasons why female dolphins are horace is female dolphins are super slutty and the reason being is because they have to fuck as many male dolphins as possible so that when they have babies, those male dolphins won't kill the babies. So the male dolphin will go, I could be mindset, might be mine. Damn the liker because they, they get the Fucker, this documentary. And so the, um, the, uh, the idea being that the mother does not breed while she's with the baby. So it takes like six years or something like that before she's going to breed again. Oh, before she breeds, because before she breeds again, because she has to take care of the baby. How old? How long does it

Speaker 1:          00:13:04       and lift? That's a good question. I don't know. I don't know, but you need to know a lot about sex life, dolphins. The thing about fucking one of those for awhile, if it only had a sheep's pussy, but it was a dolphin, put those two together. You get pocket and if you drag you through the water at the same time, take you on trips, you going 40 miles an hour, it'd be able to hold your breath. Goddamn. There'll be going to need to design some new dolphin. They can. Fuck. That's right. Or maybe you could just climb on the back of a dolphin and just get a flashlight attached to the dolphin. That could be. I heard it already feels good. There's videos on the Internet. People fucking dolphins. Have you seen this? No. No. That can't be right. That's totally real. No one's fucking dolphins do it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       Possible. Huh? The penis comes out and the woman gets underneath it. Or remember it was you making the shop. Now I'm not, now there's videos, kinds of videos that people fucking dog therapy time, actual sex. Brian, I need. I need some clarification on. Okay. We need to. We need to go deep on this one story. We can't just leave people out there thinking that there's not many people are right now going, this is bullshit. I was looking at myself. A lot of people. That's the beautiful thing about the Internet. Now instantly you could find out. You can google and at least get the general consensus. I mean, you can't find out who killed Kennedy. There's some shit that you can't find out, but you can google. Yes. On 19. Yeah. Help us win in California. Thirty short days away. Prop. Yeah, it's. Yes. On [inaudible] dot com. Thirty four days away. And what are the most recent polls? Recent polls show us winning. Oh, it depends on who's pulling. You look at Fox or what have you. And a while they make very human sounds. And Brian, he's looking at.

Speaker 1:          00:14:50       Don't tell them it's not real. It's not real apple. Dolphin uniform. Apple. Is it good to let you look at porn? Yeah, man. How you think you're going to look at that on that? They're going to take no dolphin porn. No good. Yeah, but they can't stop you from going all those, uh, those websites. Now they will go to html fire because of the IPAD. All the porn websites, they, none of them were flat base anymore until like, oh really? You can't get on the IPAD. Oh, let's just change this shit up. So on, change everything in html five. And then that works on your ipad and then you can watch porn on your ipad. Who would have known innovation leading the way? Again, it's porn leading the way. There are a lot of Christians who need their porn. They do you know. How about that new dude?

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       The guy busted. What's his name? Eddie Long. So his name, the new big bangs. Preacher boy. What is his name? Dude, that's double bad because you know, brothers and is supposed to be even thinking like brothers did not get no homo man. That's the proposition. Eight passed in California. A lot of gay people were really pissed off at black folks. Black folks voted some ridiculous number. Hey, this percentage, white folks should be mad at that Christian siblings who brought Christianity to all these poor people, you know, because that's really the problem. Okay, well you're going fake with moral a little bit far with your blame there fella. Whoa. What is this guy's name? Ed Long. What was the guy's name? Busted. I want to read this online due to be added long. That's like as right to to this size of the dolphins. Dick, the best way you can have sex with a male doctor in this.

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       The masturbator Brian male to his name is Eddie Long. It's true. Eddie long right? This fiction, you really couldn't man. It's like you remember when that was a long name. You know it, right? Here's the best part. Homies got a pink tie. Oh, how about that? So he's the one taking it. Yeah. We're watching it. Not necessarily with the pink. Tie this off. Yeah, I'm right here. Everything else is black outfits. Dark and strong. Powerful. He just said, you know, I'm into that boy pussy. Well, bringing the flashlight. This is. This is a big ad. Yeah, they're good at it. Kept it ads. They saying, fuck your Tivo. I know that's like the only time I ever watch as now or what? I'm trying to watch a youtube clip or CNN.com. Hey, you know what man, it's only 30 seconds whenever. Well of my life added up.

Speaker 1:          00:17:16       So this guy, this Ed, Eddie Long, another Christian man in a position of power that it turns out was actually banging boys. Shocking. What if, what if? What if like the Catholic church has been run by gays who were angry at the straight people this whole time, right? And they get to wear their dresses and have their fabulous cars and they drink out of the cold chalices and be covered and all these colors and live in total secrecy. And then pick out the little gay kid right out of the straight audience. Is that dating kate? Madonna. Whoa. What do you mean the church hate Madonna? You know, gay people love Mcdonald's. Mcdonald's. So that's for your analysis does not hold it. I think it's true. That's what you think it is. It's an ancient gay cult salts pope wearing the dress. Yeah, of course. Cow. What's up with that crazy fish head?

Speaker 1:          00:18:07       All of them at the Vatican at. Let me think. I don't want to fuck women. I want to go live with men for the rest of my life. Pretty much. You get and you're not even allowed to masturbate. Why don't just, Oh, nocturnal admissions. Well, you can't even dream about getting off, but how about Saul? Peter? That's shit they give them to keep them from getting horny. That's not true. It's not real. It's an urban myth. Pretty much. It's an urban myth, but they still didn't actually give it to them and stuff. I think. No, I don't think it might be in jail all the time. There's always this. Well, Peter in the food really? I don't know. Whatever. Uh, I can't say I still dream of my girlfriends and wake up feeling a failure. Rousy they're really assault Peter in jail. That's one of those urban legends type things.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       But urban legend, the whole idea is ridiculous. The whole idea that anybody would ask you to not have sex. Like why would God give me a deck if I didn't want to use it? God don't procreate, go, God does. Not only does he not want you to procreate, doesn't want you to feel affection, doesn't want you to love someone that talks about, you know, there's no evolution. There's just creationism. They don't want to talk about incestual relations between Adam and eve and all your kids. Yeah. What the fuck that come from God. Show up and get with the new boat. Hey, I got new. Fresh, fresh. There you go, brother. Sisters fucking like crazy. That would be what it had to be, wouldn't it? If you go with the Christians and then they did all this in 6,000 years. So what's up? You're my brother.

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       What's a Christian brothers? Don't eat that apple watch is bad. You know, and you know, don't listen to a union. That was the first prohibition prohibition of Thou shall not eat from the tree of knowledge. And, and who was the big cop, right? God. How many people to two people he had to police and God, according to Christian mythology couldn't handle prohibition. Yeah. How alertness is a god would make some shit that he didn't want you to eat. You don't eat it. I'm telling you I will fuck your world up. Oh, you ate the apple that I told you not to eat. Well, guess what? You don't ever get a second chance. You're fucked forever. Your whole species is fucked. Joe. Do you ever wonder if that's. Do you wonder if that snake, that one snake, the original snake ever made it? If he made it on Noah's Ark, do you ever think about that?

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       Like no one does. That snake was. The devil wasn't really that much. I know. I was just like, I was hoping that snake made it. Maybe that snake is all around us all the time. Yeah, pretty much. The whole idea that, you know, they'll make fun of fucking Muslims or that they'll make fun of scientologists. They'll make fun of, you know, like, well they've got the wrong thing. You know, we to come to Jesus. Let's see. I argue that everybody's an atheist because a Jew doesn't believe in a Christian God and the Christian God doesn't believe in Buddha and the Buddha doesn't believe in the Jewish God and none of them believe in Mohammed. So it's really, they're all atheists because they don't believe in anything, but they're little fantasy truthfully. So they're all atheists to somebody else's shit to

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       somebody else's shit. They don't believe in their other gods. So Bam, suddenly we're in alignment. I just don't also believe with any of their gods.

Speaker 3:          00:20:54       It's amazing that there are so many different religions. Hundreds. Literally, we were new. We were lost. We needed direction. We need someone to walk up and go where the food is. I know where you'll be warm. I know how to heal you sick when you die and come with me. It's amazing that there's so many different religions, but even though we know that they all say different shit, everyone is willing to die believing that the one they believe is right. Even though there's so many examples of contradicting ideas for whatever fucking reason. We compartmentalize that when we, you know, go down the road of being a mormon or go down the road of being a Catholic or a baptist, we just don't look at it.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       Just don't just say this is my team and screw your a team. And it's a very and 10 fl mentality, you know, Rah Rah, my team. You're a team.

Speaker 3:          00:21:39       It's all the same shit. It is all the same shit. When I was in Indiana, I was in Indiana for UFC. Anybody who fought somebody from Indiana, even if they were American, they would boo them. Realize you're not from Indiana.

Speaker 3:          00:21:52       That's a local boy hoosiers. But think about Indiana is great, don't get me wrong, but at the, the mentality is so fucked up that your. You're booing against other Americans because they're not from a similar place. They're not within a certain distance of where you sleep. So you're there. You don't even like them right now, who's going up against a guy like we need? We don't just have Americans versus the rest of the world will go down to neighborhoods, will break. We'll break it down to neighborhoods. We'll break it down to the hatfields and mccoys.

Speaker 2:          00:22:20       The problem with Indiana is that there's nothing else to fucking do there. And they're not known for much in Indiana. And so that movie hoosiers came out, everyone was like, sports is now our big thing. So now it's like seriously came out because sports is a big thing. Right, right, right. But, but they're so proud of that movie and that because that's all they have kind of living in Indiana to have this thing called the Indianapolis 500. That was kind of rights. Do they have a lot of shit dude? Yeah. So it's fair to bring farming back to the midwest is what we gotta do. We gotta really farming. You bring it back to him. We need him, man. Well I know farm aid right now is in its 25th year in. The problem with it is 25 years and they've gotten were because all these people they're trying to convince, they've built their, their, their farms on corn and cotton are completely wrong and they're not gonna have any economic independence back until they get there.

Speaker 3:          00:23:11       John Cougar Mellencamp came onto the screen and they booed him really? In Indiana from India. He is the cue card. He's a liberal liberal fucking real low. It was crazy. He showed them. I expected everybody to go ape shit.

Speaker 2:          00:23:32       Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:23:33       Move.

Speaker 2:          00:23:35       You know, in Ohio the farms are getting so bad that they're like closing farms left and right, that a lot of the farms are turning into shopping centers where my mom lived just in five years, used to be farms everywhere and now it's like commercial buildings and they're just, they're losing all these farms because there's no money in it or something's not going on. Right, right. At, in the farming industry in Ohio,

Speaker 3:          00:23:55       well there's, it's very difficult to run a farm and make a profit. It's incredibly difficult. It's so fucking

Speaker 2:          00:24:00       hard, especially when you're up against unfair trade practices in fucking fuels that come from 9,000 miles away. How about c?

Speaker 3:          00:24:06       Do you know you don't even own your seeds when you're a farmer, when you

Speaker 2:          00:24:10       big deal and you know what hemp is the one thing that we need to really push that we don't have gml control of. We have to stand up and ask for a, you know, our civil rights back. We have to demand them and back. In fact, I mean, when we.

Speaker 3:          00:24:22       When the seeds thing though, what I was saying is when you buy seeds, if you're a farmer, you buy these seeds that have been made by this company. Monsanto. Yeah. You don't own those seeds. You Go, you got those seeds and when you plant your new plants and you grow, like save you grow peppers, you can't take the seeds out of those peppers and grow more peppers

Speaker 2:          00:24:41       because you don't own that. You don't own that. They'll sue you in copywritten. If it is, it's incredible. Monsanto has actually people that go around and test crops of people that they suspect are using a generation away from their last seat and it's really scary. I mean, and you know crazy is that we take those seeds and like make new new versions of that seed. It can't trace of it. No. Is that medically modified so they know

Speaker 3:          00:25:08       the genome of this particular plant that they've created is. So if you have that shit in your field, you have to pay them every year. Every year you have to pay for new seeds. You can't do the way people always did it. You grew tomatoes, you took the seeds from the tomatoes mode tomatoes, they can't, you can't do that. Now. It's illegal, but data is the nuttiest shit ever, and that's the number one reason for Jimmy genetically modifying food is to control the market. And that's the number one reason. Also why marijuana will always remain illegal to a lot of people there. They'll want to keep it illegal rather is because I can't control it. No,

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       you know, hemp is grown in every industrialized country other than America. It amazing. How crazy is that? Canada right up north, right above us, right? They're growing it. They grow all of the seed products that are in whole foods and all that. Nutrition. So all this is money that farmers could be making this shit. All this shit. They're stealing from them. These cons, the government is stealing from them. Steve Miller, Julie, and it's dealing it by denying them their culture. Fucking best country. There's going to Indiana,

Speaker 3:          00:26:13       they're going to bomb California is what they're gonna. What are they going to do that proposition nine takes over 19, 19, proposition 19 thinking gay. It's running when the, um, when they, when that shit goes into effect, if and when it's going to change the culture, it's kind of, that's the big change is going to be in people's behavior because you can talk all the paper you want, but what was the most fascinating thing to me is what it does to people socially. It changes the fuck out of human beings, right?

Speaker 2:          00:26:42       Well, you know, some of the things people are coming out against prop. Nice 19 to saying is that it's going to lend itself to corporations and it's not true. Corporations are not saying that. Who's saying that? Well, believe it or not, we have a lot of people that are in the medical marijuana industry that don't want to see prop 19 past because they're comfortable right now and they're profiteering and they don't want to see, you know, a status quo change. And it's really sad because these are the people that would benefit the most when they're local communities allow them to start selling to anybody over 21 without a doctor's note. Right? But the doctors who've been making their living for all these years, given away prescriptions and charged 150 bucks a pop, that's the source of income these guys have. That's where historically wealthy and they'll do fine.

Speaker 2:          00:27:21       Actually practicing medicine, I'm sure maybe, but when you're set up for years and years and years, just given out medical marijuana prescriptions and you're comfortable with it, then all sudden something's going to come along to make your business go away. You're going to have to come up with some whole new business, but if you're a selfish douche bag, I could see where you'd be like, man, I don't want this. Isn't that why the alcohol beverage industry is giving to the campaign against us? Isn't that why all these interested self interested companies are stepping up? Some kids, you don't expect it out of the medical marijuana doc. Another lie heard was that big tobacco moneys behind this when it's such bullshit proposition 19. Yes. When you can look up and see where all the money came from, it it realistically, the prop 19 was passed by somebody that has somebody I've known for over 15 years.

Speaker 2:          00:28:03       He's a really good person that really just wanted to do the right thing. He wanted to put forward a more liberal PR initiative, but he had cash and he pulled the initiative and he found that more liberal initiatives. We're not polling well enough to actually pass, so we actually pulled back, pull back, pull back on the verbiage until the gun initiative that polled well enough to pass and what a lot of people don't realize is that this is not the means to the end. This is just. Or this is a means to the end. It's not the end. It's just one small step in the evolution of getting our freedoms back and this prop 19 is going to be one step closer to having our rights back and what a lot of people aren't talking about, which is pissing me off, is that we got meg whitman buying her way into the governorship and we have Steve Cooley who has been the guy down here in la.

Speaker 2:          00:28:46       For those of you who don't live in La, who has been closing down all the Los Angeles pot clubs, and if this guy gets the top cop position in the state of California and prop 19 loses all of these idiots and I'll say you are idiots that are going against prop 19 that are selling medical marijuana, are going to lose your businesses and lose your freedoms and the only thing that's going to protect you right now is if everybody in the state gets the rights that you have been getting for the last 14 years since medical marijuana concentrate on these dildos. Let's concentrate on that. Yeah, let's try and concentrate on that cop. What's the. Yeah, I'm sorry. Steve Cooley is. This is the guy that's running for attorney general and he's basically running it. Somebody that's against the death penalty and in California you might as well be running, get somebody on a post running against someone who's against the death penalty.

Speaker 2:          00:29:32       Yes. Oh, so he's running unopposed in that sense. He is. Absolutely. And when he gets in, his agenda is to do in the state, but he has already done in La. Well why's he want to shut down medical pot stores ideologically and who knows what, who knows what he's invested in, who knows what his reality is from those campaigns, how to his life, you know, who knows who, who, who really he's loyal to in that sense. You know, but there's something, there's some campaign contributions or something. There's something going on. I would love to be able to find it, follow the money forensically and see exactly where it came to these people because in some ways there's got to be strings pulling them, you know, and it's not cheap to run a campaign in the state of California. You need to get on the side to people with a lot of money.

Speaker 2:          00:30:12       That's where don't have a lot of that money that she is very, very rich. And what is she? What was her position in Ebay? She had something to do with Ebay. She, I thought, founded, not founded. She was the one that was brought in and brought them from being a very small company to a very large company. She helped organize them and she rode their growth curve. Okay, so she made a ton of money off Ebay and now she wants to be the governor and she's spending how much money to do this already. Spent over 100 million dollars of her own money to become governor of $100,000,000 for a job that pays 200,000 a year. Google it people much as pay. It's pays nothing. And, and this is the scarier part. It's like, what do you think she's going to accomplish with this hundred million dollar influence? What is she doing this for?

Speaker 2:          00:30:53       A testament to their ego. You know, it's building a big, you know, don't do it too. And you know, this is just turned my volume down. No, this is the part that kind of bothers me is that this is more of what we've had for a long time. It's just that now we're looking at it and were grossed out by it, but don't think before newspapers and Internet carried the word that robber barons weren't running politics going back to the thirties and forties and fifties. And when, when I say they, I don't mean to sound like some conspiracy nut. I mean to sound like somebody that's realistic about the fact that alcohol got together after prohibition and went, Yo, who's our competition? Oh, these kids are smoking this local weed out a psa and then they really should go after talking to this way. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:31:29       This is Meg Whitman woman. She is obviously very wealthy. Um, so it's going to be very difficult to buy a person who's very wealthy. She very wealthy. So why would this very wealthy person want to stop medical marijuana in California? Because that is what she wants to do. What would be her motivation? Because it would not be financial, right? She doesn't need the money. She's spending 100 million dollars. Can I say governor? You don't think that the alcohol companies for sure and not giving her $100, million million, killing. You have that much money, Joe, it isn't sitting in a locker at the edge of your bed. It's sitting in investments and I'd love to know what her portfolio is invested in because she has people that are actually standing there saying, this is what I'll advise you to do, and anybody that's advising somebody that has literally hundreds of millions of dollars vested way is going to say, listen, this initiative is bad for your liquor investments.

Speaker 2:          00:32:14       It's bad for your pharmaceutical investments. It's bad for a financial decision on her part. A lot of why we're dealing with prohibition and why we're dealing with people that are against it is because of the financial connections they have in the more wealthy they are, the more that people lean against them. How? How few? In a sense do we have a view? Because here you are a guy that made it in TV. Five years of Newsradio, five plus years on fear factor. You have a career. You will have advisors around you saying, listen Joe, if you do stupid stuff, it's going to knock it you the big jobs that will pay a lot of money and then I'm not going to make money. So where those Pearson's going to advise you to go be the activist that you've become? Are they going to say, Bro? Really? Because I know that a lot of other actors have to stop and think, man, I won't get hired if, if I start getting all radical and that's what they really believe. So they towed the line. You are so rare because you haven't told the line. He said, fuck it. I'd rather be happy and be myself than be some slave to a corporate, you know, dictation.

Speaker 3:          00:33:09       Yeah, well you don't have to do it that way. Those guys are pussies. A lot of them are. But when you're a nice person, but how few woody Harrelson's and Joe Rogan's do we have speaking up for the right reasons. Um, well, you know what? A lot of people have families and they want to play it safe and they feel conservative and they get paranoid and they don't trust in the greater good of humanity and the people's ability to see what they're saying. They don't. They don't have faith in their ability to express themselves so that people understand the point of view that they have and where they're coming from. I have confidence in my ability to express myself and you do it for us all in the way that's important for everybody. I think everybody should and would do it. If you're. If you're a rational thinking person, why would you live your life pretending to be something other than who you are.

Speaker 3:          00:33:51       You know? Why would you not want people to know about something that's radically changed the way you look at the world? Why would you not want to? Why? Because fucking meg whitman says it's bad. We get that bitch. Get the fuck. Did she quit or get fired from Ebay? I don't know because she's a woman who wants to be in control of things. It's always 75 percent of Ebay's audience stone people in the middle of night buying shit. She shouldn't have her audience. I don't know. She probably pulled this airplane. I got fired. You know she's a slapped away. Far more lucrative. Creepy man. Women don't want to run. Shit creeped me out. No, I know it sounds gross, but it's totally true. Soundwise Hillary Clinton. He doesn't. She doesn't creep you out. She is a creep me the fuck out. Right? But at least a rise of Condoleeza Rice was running things.

Speaker 3:          00:34:35       When you think you'd freak the fuck out. Creepy guys. Dick Cheney came to. I'm not saying I want guys running shit, but at least they've been doing that forever. My older chick wants to hop in there and compete with the men. I'm like, what are you crazy bitch? What are you doing? You're not balanced. You ain't got no fucking Yogi. You're not going to see through the maze. You're. You're fucking just as crazy as the men, if not crazier, because you have to because you're a woman and because they're going to prove that they're tougher than the men they're replacing. That scares me. I there was a moment where Hillary Clinton was running for president when I was thinking, you know what? She's going to win at. What if she wins and she gets a new position where one of these crazy fucks from another country tests her because she's a woman.

Speaker 3:          00:35:14       I mean if that political power is real and that the president really has any say, and then anybody in another country really does pay attention to them, that it's not all this big, gigantic build a burger meeting group. Assuming that a president is real, could you imagine what Putin would do if he sat across from fucking Hillary Clinton or salar Pailin at a. it's some sort of a. it's horrible. He would crush them, isn't a mock them. He would. He would. Most cultures put their most intellectually capable people in power and not their best idiots. It's just, it's not that. It's not that men should be running shit right. It's not. It's the most capable bit of the alpha. The one, the idea of having a leader is fucking ridiculous. I think it's an archaic shit that we have to figure a new way around, so I'm not saying that men should be running shit.

Speaker 3:          00:36:05       Anybody who was a woman that wants to run shit, like that's kinda crazy. Like you don't even have a dick. Why are you trying to control everything? What are you doing? Why are you trying to fucking grab the reins? What do you do it? I don't want to be president. Okay. I'm not. I don't want to be a leader. I'm don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that I am better than a woman who would be doing the job. I'm saying when I see a woman who wants to be a leader, I understand the man wanting to be a leader. It makes sense to me. Even if I don't believe in it or agree with it. I understand it. When I say a woman is wanting to do it, I'm like, look at that crazy bitch. That's what I think. I think you want to be the king of the world and you're a chick.

Speaker 3:          00:36:36       Whoa. You know? But yet, Iceland's not in wars and they had a female froze. I was thinking of all that female leaders around the world. I'm like, there's a lot. I totally sexist. It's totally sexist, don't get me wrong. But I don't think anybody should be a leader. I think the whole idea based on science, it's based on some leftover fucking shit from back when we were a tribe of 200 monkey people and we needed a leader to protect us from the other monkey people wanted to rape our women and take our food. I mean, that's what it is. The idea that one person can represent the whole country, like a president. I don't give a fuck if he has a cabinet. I don't give up the idea that there's a one guy that stands there and gentlemen, the president of the United States, you know, even the figurehead, even if the descendant of royalty, it's shirt and it's an Avatar, that the whole idea is ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          00:37:29       It's, it's, it's so really created our whole structure in America to compete against what they were, what they were fighting. And then they became and they became wayward, right? Wayward. It's beautiful. I love that. I'm going to hear so much shit from my female friends. Well thank you. Don't think women should be running things. Oh, what does that mean? I think men do it better. Maybe. Maybe might have been doing it wrong for so long. Maybe be good for a woman to give it a try. Like you're definitely comfortable in your relationship. That's a worldly thing to say. If she's a woman, meaning like, I know what I mean. I'm not going to be like, yeah, fuck women should be presidents now. I'm like, what was his name to be president? What are you talking about? He's saying he's afraid to get his dick cut off when it goes home.

Speaker 3:          00:38:11       And he's obviously saying you're not. So what he's saying is you misread he's saying is he's trying to pretend to be someone different. So he's attractive female race. It is. I'm not a bashing that females rate. Listen, most females, the women that take that are constant and not bashing the female racers. I'm not bashing them male race. It doesn't want to be president. You know, most of the male race doesn't want to be president. You don't want to be president. It's not a male thing. It's a leader thing, but what I'm saying is I understand the creepy fuck control freak men. I understand that instinct, but when I see a chick that wants a rock that I go, what's going on there? Sarah Pailin. I guess one way. Sarah Palin's just his dummy that got stuck into a nice position that she's trying to make some money. I mean, that's really what it is, but after awhile it's not that anymore. After a while it's like, well, you're the figurehead for the retard movement and you're just like them and you got a microphone on you and there's a spotlight on you and Oh, now you're a fucking problem because you never were supposed to get to this point and send out. You've artificially been inserted into the public consciousness with no merit and now all the retards go.

Speaker 3:          00:39:18       They rise up and start these fucking tea party rallies. Have you watched any of that shit? Crazy God damn thing Glenn Beck is just making gold underwear and gold socks and diamond covered fucking cars from that guy. Must be just scraping it in with raikes. She'll obviously fully shit too. It's like his game only works on the DM. It only put. There's so many dumb people. It's a very effective tactic. Him and her together. Men, they scare the fuck out of double dumb dumb. Glenn Beck and Sarah Pailin. They combined forces with the president. Do they could. They could run for president, man. That's real shit. I hope that

Speaker 2:          00:39:55       presidents of black lady with a list and that's totally a lesbian. I hope it's like every single horrible thing that's wrong with, you know, like banning gay marriage, you know, women presidents. I hope it's all combined into one like super president that just pisses off everybody hope it's an alien, an alien

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       alien winds than disguise of a human being and then tells her buddy, now that we have a deputy that we'd like to know that I'm in place and I'm running shit, but just need to sit the fuck down. We've been thinking about exterminating you. Fucks for about 50 years now. I thought your concept of us being cold was really accurate. Well, it is a giant life form. It's a giant life form on a super organism. That's what the human race is. The human race is on earth. Earth is a life form. It is a super organism. You know? We don't think of planets that support life as a life form, but because it's an environment where life grows, but I'm not so sure about that. If you look at lava and the center and the magnetic core and you look at the magnetosphere and the atmosphere and like this is not just a place where life is. It's almost like a system. It's alive and well. I don't know what's conscious man. We're guessing and we assume that conscious means that it can talk like us and move like Gospel. We don't know. We don't. There's a lot of evidence that there might be something going on inside trees. Some sort of fucking a real reaction that trees and plants have to pee. People

Speaker 2:          00:41:19       will thank US cellular intelligence. Yeah, and that's really where we've always thought, oh, it's in our brain, and then there's this myth that we don't even use our own brain, all of our brain, and it's like, really? Do you know how many of us are you stupid that you believe that your whole body's not actually it all,

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       all marks right now. And I think that our capability of intelligence is really, really deep. That's a metaphor. I think for, um, wasted potential if people have this idea that we're only using 10 percent of our brains. If we just really concentrate like that. No one even knows what that means. What does that mean? You're only using 10 percent of your brain. What's going on with the other 90 percent of useful? Well, you know how we know how the brain works when we blow holes and parts of the brain, we shoot people in parts of their head and then gonna go, oh, I can't see anymore. I guess that's the part where you see out of it. Oh, we drill the hole here on Sundays. Calm. Well, I guess this is the part that makes them aggressive. We'll just drill a hole in that, but that's the law.

Speaker 3:          00:42:10       Bottomy. That's what they did. When people get a little nutty, they go, what do you wanna do you to kill him? We want to drill a fucking hole in his head and see if we can fix something. One flew over the cuckoo's nest. Yeah. They would fix people by drilling holes in their head. Hollaback back. Do you know you ever. There's a whole group of humans that voluntarily put holes in their head and they believe that it alleviates pressure and gives them euphoria and that the pressure of the growing brain trapped inside the skull causes headaches and all sorts of problems, and in Africa there's fucking cultures that have done this where they literally. They caught the entire skull. I posted it on twitter, see if he can find it. I mean, I don't know what you would look under. There's A. There's a term for it.

Speaker 3:          00:42:53       There's a term for it for holes in where they call shit. I'm fucking up here because there's an actual term for it, but people do it on purpose. It's like it's a. it's a. see if you can find that, but people will fall interi holes and panning. Panning. T R e p a n I n g itself, near. You'd sleep pressure beneath the surface. Yeah, and there's, there's a video of these African dudes where they do it with no anesthesia and they do it with these fucking stone tools. They like strip away your fucking scalped and cut out your bone. Oh, they don't just do it once. They do it as many as 20 times they ended. Yeah, and they fucked their brains up. Dudes are not only that though, you'd have to wear it. They have to wear hats from that I'm sure. Because their brain is exposed.

Speaker 3:          00:43:43       There's a like a canoe shape cutout on the top of their fucking skull. Dr John Clark with the first one to do it in 16, 64 and he taught the Africans tend to do it and that's what they're saying to us. I'm sorry, us us American. Hmm. Well he might've. It might've been just like religion. We brought Christianity over to Africa. It just says first fits physician to perform it in the US. And he did it as a alleviating pressure on someone. Whoa. It's like, if you can think about it, someone's out there doing it, man. You've seen those women in Surrey. Is that. Whereas in Africa where they cut their lip and stick a plate in it. Have you seen that shit? You know what I'm talking. You never seen the plates and the lips. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't know the theory to the named.

Speaker 3:          00:44:27       It's the most insane thing. It's not just weird. The bigger the plate, the more cows they're worth when they get married. So like saying if you want to marry my daughter, okay. And she's got a giant ass fucking plate. I'm like, bitch, that was a 50 cal plate. You've got to come strong sign. Right? So dudes would have to give her her. They have to give up a herd because she's willing to carry around this giant plate in her lips. What else? Issue in their teeth out to. They have to bang their lower teeth out because the plate sits there and you can't get a full plate in there if you have the lower teeth. So when the plate starts getting big, they have to smash their teeth out. You might blow jobs filled like probably does Africa suck. People willing to do that? You're willing to put plates in your lips and cut holes in your heading where they stretch the neck out.

Speaker 3:          00:45:15       That's fucking crazy. They must be so freaked out. They got stuck in Africa. They're like, look, we're going to make this interesting. Right? But here we are stuck running from hyenas and getting eaten by crocodiles and shit. We're going to have to stretch our next album, Mike, our next real big. Well, who knows why they do these things well, how about those heads of. They found in Peru where they stretch their head out gigantic, like a big alien head. They did it to like a huge percentage of the population. They put boards in their heads and tied them down and literally extended their head. You know, and people were thinking, well, is this to emulate something, is to emulate the gods. All the Annunaki people like, see this is evidence they were doing this to try to emulate, maybe not. Because look at these Africans that cutting the fucking holes in their lives and stick and plates and they, the dudes cutting the holes in their heads and letting the air out, you know, they're not emulating anything. They're just practicing medicine. They're fucking nuts, man. People are nuts.

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       Well, they're still kind of. Numbers are trolling everyone. He knows freaky. The disease I had as a child I found out in the mid eighties, they stopped treating aggressively that like more when I was in the seventies, I was more a victim of fucking chemotherapy and an elective surgeries are not elective surgeries, but surgeries that weren't needed and radiation than I was of the actual disease because they were practicing. Well, yeah, you know, it's fucked up to is the accent. Histiocytosis x meant that the pathology of the disease was unknown. And when I first asked an adult, you know, where did my disease come from? And they went, we don't know. And I was like, wait, who's we, you and me? Or like, we like. So what exactly is the disease history of an overactive immune system isn't site. It's history. Oh, site history of cytosis x and it's an overactive right, like I would have too many white blood cells and they would like in a sense accumulate, if you will. And uh, usually it was in like bone marrow and areas like that and it creates like blow out. So like my, my spine, it blew out my arm. It blew out my hip. It blew out.

Speaker 3:          00:47:04       Would it get better if you got sick? What do you mean? Sick? Got a cold?

Speaker 2:          00:47:10       No, no, no, no, think no. Don't sees it all the time. But it's funny as I don't really ever get sick either. I either have problems where like obviously it was overgrowing, you know, in marrows and stuff or I'm always healthy. I went through prison five years. I didn't get a cold. Whoa. Yeah. And a crazy place.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       Let me tell you, but start looking toilets. I don't like touching doors and shit though. I'm not a Germaphobe, but I actually, I'm careful. People are gross. Yeah. People nose picking balls, scratching ass. Fucking wipe and just disgusting fucking. Which is why I always recommend you use the tissue from the bathroom when you opened the door to any public restroom. Take mine open like a man. Not if you've got to pull it with a man, you have to twist it and pull it. Usually you do actually use a piece of that. There's ways you can protect yourself. And if we had hemp, we can be using hemp towel. Man, you just have to clean it man. We'll get some hemp flashlights, which is why we have to vote yes on 19 the vote yes on 19. It's very important and if you're one of those people out there that goes, man, you're fucking annoying.

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       Unfortunately, there's a lot of potheads are annoying. You know, most potheads lot of straight people. Yeah. Like most people, a good percentage of people are annoying. And the reason being is because we do not have a direction book on how to properly live a healthy life and healthy, fun, satisfying life. You know, we, we, we live our lives based on myths and Bullshit TV shows and movies and we have this distorted perception of what this fucking world is all about. So most people with, especially with the situation that we have now, the way our world is set up, it's so easy for a moron. Just drift through and be taken care of every step of the way and yet have opinions and yet be able to vote. George Bush Jr. Sarah pailin. Man, that'S way scarier than her, than him. Gary coleman. He was a man. Wow, that's right.

Speaker 1:          00:49:03       I said it. Gary coleman. Gary coleman. We could vote. Yeah. Angry as fuck. I'd been angry too after his whole life. You know, the saddest Part of his life would not have been when he was in the hospital. Dead, dying and is fucking crazy. Ex wife takes a picture and sells it to My over him, like all strapped up with pipes and shit dying in bed and she's right next to him with his dead. She did that yet. Dead fucking rubber face. Just like didn't have any emotion in her eyes. Nothing like up here he is, he's dead and this is me. I'm next to the dead guy. that's horrible. Oh, it's gross. Reprise that shit on like pads. I'm pretty sure. well, I've never seen that. It did not know she did that. yeah, that's pretty darn. I'm learning. I'm learning. Well you got saved even.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       Huh? Finger should usually I'd do. You know, I can't thank you enough for coming out and support prop. Nineteen minutes dude. You know I enjoy the marijuana. So of course I've got to support prop 19. You know a lot of people that have been really confused on what this really does man. And you know that's been a big problem for us because I was talking about what I'm saying. Most people will. You look at pot ads, you think they're annoying, right? Really? I'm finding I'm annoying right now because I can't believe all these people I was working around that we thought I thought was working towards a common goal and now working against it because a lot of people were against prop 19. That's what you're sayinG. a lot of people are against prop 19. Not for the right reasons, either financial reasons, financial reasons or inaccuracy, how muCh most hippies are though. Every time

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       I ever was hanging out with hippies, they were trying to make money like making profits and still now there's a lot of the ideas, a lot of non hippies that are just commercially motivated. THere's a bunch of people that have just been in this industry in the last few years since sb four slash 20 passed and allowed for clubs. They're trying to make money and right now they think, oh no, you're going to change this and we like this, so please don't change this, and that is really what we're up against when it comes from the the enemy within, if you will. There's a lot of people that aren't hippies. They're opportunists. They are. I knoW a bunch of people that are in the business idealism. Oh yeah. The people that own like dispensary's, they're doing a purely for profit. There's a lot of good ones. Berkeley, harborside.

Speaker 2:          00:51:09       They're all good. There's a lot of good ones. ProvIde something that's good. Marijuana is good, but there's a lot of people that you wouldn't expect. They're not like old dudes with gray hair and ponytails right there. They're younG dudes. It looks like they're fucking doing squats. Prop 19 is gonna. Make it so these people aren't having to get away with it. It's they're going to be able to serviCe their neighbors who have a right to have pot and everybody in. The state's going to have a right to grow pot and that's going to be a big, big yeah, so all these people that are selling it, the shit's going to go under because no one's going to need to buy it. You can just grow your own. So easy to see the prices drop. Well thankfully you know radically and profits are going to drop and right now you know it's the liquor companies.

Speaker 2:          00:51:45       It's the biG drug cartels. These are the people that are more than willing to play exaCtly what I'm paying right now. Just keep making it just as good. I'll pay just as you know, there's always going to be thousand dollar bottles of wine, you know, and there's going to be people that do things with the high quality and grandma could grow better than me for instance, and you'll want grandma's pot over mine. I Want to look like cheetos. I wanted to see like, let's see. Hi. Of I just been throwing out my window is that it doesn't. It doesn't really lend itself for quality with quantity because when you have large amounts of it, you don't have in a sense is as good a quality control right now in smaller batches. Now let's talk about one thing for the nonsmoking non marijuana smoking amongst us. This is one of the things that reallY fascinated me the most when I first found out about marijuana.

Speaker 2:          00:52:34       When I first, when I first, when I was a kid, I thought marijuana was bad for you, made you stupid, all these different things. But when I first stArted smoking weed, the thing that fascinated me the most was that there are two completely different strains that have very different effects. Just different string. Okay. Let me break this down. can I say this right now? There's a lot of confusion in this. Before I went to prison, a friend of mine, he wrote marijuana, botany and he later wrote the book has been revised. HIs name's robert carnal clock. He's forgotten more about cannabis and I've had an opportunity to learn. And um, while I was in prison, these scientists actually looked at the specimens of sativa and indica and sativa and indica where questions. So if I walked up to you at seeds, joe, it would actually be.

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       Does this make clothing and paper and all this stuff? Or is it like India? Because there's, if you look up the word endeca, endeca means of. Or like India. Okay. So when you go to India, all of the cannabis that's grown there is endeca because it's in India. But when you go there, you'll find tropical varieties down by goer and northern varieties up by the area that's now Pakistan and hindu kush. That is the entire range of cannabis. And it's all indycar history. Lesson is interesting, but either everyone today who wants pot, there's two different effects in tacoma. Makes you sleepy and it makes you couch weed. It makes you what a lot of people think of as a stoner. Sativa is a totally different experience and it makes you much more introspective and makes you start looking at fucking telescopes and space documentaries. So let me, let me saY strain.

Speaker 2:          00:54:04       What should we call it? Well, it's an equatorial variety. It's from near the equator because. Let me break this down. There's two different effects though. Correct? And this is what I want people not pot smokers to understand this. When you go into these deep historical, it's not but, but definitely in the sixties and seventies, all the pot that was coming into America was acapulco, gold, michu, ican, molly wiley, jamaican. All of these strange were the equator tropical. They made you hoppi, horny, well organized, wanting to do things like protests, and then the hippies went to Afghanistan. They found this short fat leaves plant that they thought was endeca and they started mixing it with all these tropical varieties like maui wowie and thai stick and stuff, and they shortened the time it takes to flower cannabis and they picked varieties that yielded the most amount of pot because it isn't being

Speaker 3:          00:54:52       the ones that were ecuadorian. The ones that were growing on the equator needed a longer cycle of sun

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       because it's right, because they're in a 12, 12 and those are the ones

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       that have the different psychoactive effect. The ones that come in contact more with the sun or the ones that make

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       not so much more with the sun. It's just the varieties that develop near the equator where there was a longer cycle are more innocent psycho and in a sense in America they have to be grown indoors. Yep. And then what happened is the hippies in a sense, started breeding this afghan with all of their tropical varieties and through the eighties we kind of developed this one hit wonder pot that took away all that good energy and took away all that. And now for me, I always smoke haze. I like super silver haze and then a five by what people don't understand what you're saying, haze mean sativa in a sense. It Does in the sense our terminology of sativa, but sativa really means most useful. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:43       The way. Okay, that's true. But what's that's not how it's used in dispensary's, indycar and sativa is how it's used. Sativa is the heady more trippy space. We'd and endeca is

Speaker 2:          00:55:55       couch high energy.

Speaker 3:          00:55:57       My whole point in the beginning was I did not know there was two different types of pot. I thought pat was pot and then all pod had a similar effect. Some pot maybe stronger than other pond, but it's basically all pot. You're going to smoke pot, you leave get really high or what, but it's not the same. It's not even remotely the same. There are two different experiences and almost everyone is used to India because India [inaudible] the easiest shit to grow and because the shit that you're getting, if you're getting it from some dudes are coming down from Canada, growing

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       brick weed that grows the fastest and us the most. And now that we're getting through prohibition will see these varieties that take longer and yield less, but have a profoundly different effect on our energy and our thinking. And so how is it wrong? What I was saying, well it's not sativa, everybody's calling it sativa, but sativa really means hemp. It's indo european hemp derived. Right? But we've decided we haven't named what, what, what, what everyone. Universally, in the pot community, they're looking at two different things into and sativa. That's what they called it, right? That's as universally in the poc community. They're all just annoys you. Make with your mouth. Had described something. Absolutely different noise soon. We're not going to call it sativa and indica once we went. No, no, no. Right now we look, we call reality. California's not that lead and coach.

Speaker 1:          00:57:09       We'd, what do we call it? We'll call it names like, you know, arrowhead or you know, avi on or whatever. We're calling that water at the time. We don't really go get me a bottle of water when we're sitting in a five star restaurant. We say, do you have and to do you have bottled water? What am I a fucking water kind of sore and now I just want water. Okay, now trip on this the same way right now. You walk up to a week counter, it's almost like the same thing because you can't make distinguishes like you do liquor and when you walk up to a bar, you know the difference between wine and whiskey and if somebody you ought to whiskey and they hand you wine, you're going to be like, yo douche bag. This isn't what I asked for. But when I go to the store I say, hey, where's your sativas?

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       Oh, we got jack cleaner. We got train regard. Give me some of that train wreck. I mean that's the way we do, but technically all drug varieties are endeca. What? No, there's two different types that when you go to indicate when you go to India and you get into and it's going to suck my dick. There's two different experiences. We're still good as data people don't know. Look, practical knowledge is very important. What all he's saying is all nonsense. There's two different experiences. There's the couch weed and there's the weed that makes you think about the universe and want to be creative. So that's sativa. That's what they call it. The endeca shit is oji kush, you know, I'm going to take a nap and eat cheetos all day.

Speaker 1:          00:58:22       Oh gee. Grows very much like a sativa just so you know. It's long and leggy and grows tall and a small buds and the different. It's a more version of the event. I know. It's weird. My, my hayes, my sativa you're calling it came back at 23 point seven thc and my oji cushion. Dukkha. It came back at 20 point six. There was a three point one. Differences. There are a bunch of different things canabinoids other than thc that make up the high. It's not just thc. Well actually I think that um, there was a doctorate and by the way, we should point out that todd knows his shit. Where's your book? Like, who is this? God? Well, there was a doctor. What does he know? This is what he knows, bitch. He's got a book how to grow medical marijuana out of europe. Oh, I'm right here. No, I came back. It's on a delay. This is a a book how to grow medical marijuana and it's not. It's not in print right now. Right now to get it. You go to amazon.com and maybe get a used copy. YEs, probably do that right on my next book. Grow. Medicine's going to come out and I'm going to be talking about

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       strain. Specific growing. Yeah. You could write a lot of books on growing wheat. It's very complex, isn't it? It is, and there's a lot of differences when people try to say, oh, generalized is how you grow pot. You can tell they've never grown pot because pot is very different to grow. I mean, go ahead. I was going to say, this is a question I need answered because I do not understand it. Now the there's a female plant and a male plant and you need the female plant is where the medicine comes from. Where we come from, right? they're both right, but. But they become one or the other, like you have to get the males out. Explain what happens, like how it pollinates sales or sex, much like men in in an irony, you'll find fun. Normal with other plants. By the way, some plants are either dioecious or have both sexes on one plant.

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       Cannabis actually can be both because it doesn't matter night and sometimes fuse on it. So you get a mail, you got to get it out of there. Right? Males actually create their pollen sac faster than the females actually develop their butts. And in hemp, for instance, the males pollinate and then die off early. And the roman catholic church miscategorized the male and female plants, even though the female had the seeds and even though the male blue, the pollen, they didn't like that. The male died off early. so they called the male, the female and the female to male. Yeah, they were heavy. They were heavy into their dogma. You know, can't, can't, can't, can't rattle their cage. That's the way cannabis where, how do you tell? So if you grow and see if she'd grown a bunch of weed plants, you have to keep an eye on them bitches because if they all, they're all males just like certain leaves, like little tiny.

Speaker 2:          01:00:50       It's not all these. What they do is they develop these little, they developed these little male pollen sacks, if you will. And what they do is they come off the flower different. They come off the plant and they kinda, they hang like little ball sacs and they open up and then the, then the, then the pollen. This is a male flower open. The pollen is carried to the. If you've ever seen the little red hairs on your pot, those are the sex glands and they are to hire at all what the red. The red hair doesn't get you higher at all. The red hair doesn't have crystals on, you know, they just had these cool though. So you get some weed and you're like that red hair scott. Doesn't matter what you want. Yeah. And it's funny because it's so pretty, but when that male pollen hits those pistols, what it does is it causes that to fertilize in the seed, grows in that little pod and if she doesn't get fertilized, that pod just scoot swells and swells and swells and the resin develops deeper.

Speaker 2:          01:01:40       That's why we grow seedless cannabis because it's like tricking the female into like really producing a lot of residents and a lot of, you know, just she's waiting and waiting and waiting to be fertilized. It never comes. So it makes it more potent. Well, you know, potency I think is an interesting conversation. There was a doctor at the institute of medicine who got up one day and he said, I gave my patients 10 milligrams thc and they had a known effect and then they gave him 10 milligrams thc in one milligram cbn and it doubled the effective dose. And I shot my hand up and I said, hey, would that replicate in nature? And he said, I think it would. And when I put my hand down, my publisher said, what did you two geeks just asking each other? And I said, basically he told me to breed hemp in with my drug varieties because cbn for instances, a chemical that's mostly found in hemp and as we have bread away from the characteristics of these equity, loreal varieties that are more hemp, like, uh, we have actually bred more towards the drug varieties and we've lowered the chemical of cbn down while raising the up with less of an effective rate.

Speaker 2:          01:02:38       So now we have thc levels over 20 percent that wouldn't, that don't hit us as hard as I believe is if we had a little bit of cbn mixed in with it. How many different cannabinoids are there inside a marijuana plant? Um, well, there are over 400 chemicals created by the cannabis plant. And that's the definition of a cannabinoid. And uh, the reality is, is that 60 of them are known to be therapeutic or your shit's vibrate. It's okay. We'll ignore it. It was coming through the microphone. And, uh, and what's going to happen is that as science understands these elements of it more than they'll be able to better direct what the different chemicals. And alSo terpene, because terpenes are these volatile oils that are on the bud and what happens is they're kind of steamed off when it's dried. So if anybody's ever picked up a cannabis flower and it had good body and you squished it and had studied moisture and you could smell it was real strong.

Speaker 2:          01:03:27       Those turpines were intact anD even that has a psychoactive effect. It's very much an a synergistic psychoactive effects. So it's good. It's good. Overdrawing it bad job because likes to take his weed and put it on the heater. I put that shit on a year to make joints. I put that shit on the window sill. Let it dry out. Yeah, perfect. I put it. Sometimes I put it on top of the tv, but the reality is is because a lot of what he's getting is people that are hurrying to market and they sell pot that's not dry and not cured. The best cannabis is actually not just dried but cured and then stored for about three months and then see oil set up and they're the smoothest. Yes. And then there's a window of when those cannabinoids actually keep themselves, which is between three months and nine months.

Speaker 2:          01:04:10       So after nine, after nine months, you, we'd starts to degrade, chemically decompose in a sense. Yes. So old weeds, whack, whatever. What about if you cook different, how about different, what have you cook with it? We feel really good old chocolate bar, an old chocolate bar. How long does that last? If you have an old we chocolate bar older than nine months in the dairy product and it will be moldy and you have other issues with dark chocolate, they're ramped up. Well, not the kind of pain is you have some of those, those, uh, old fucking nestle's quik bars have they made with wheat. Uh, you know, a lot of why I don't eat cannabis that's provided to me by people is because I don't know the conditions in which it's made and they don't trust their, you know, the way they handled it and stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:04:52       And yet not Just measuring because you don't know how strong it's going to be. Interestingly enough, you know in holland I'm like hash bond bonds and brownies are considered a hard drug. Totally verboten. Yeah. You can be 16 and go into a dutch coffee shop, buy hash on your way to high school and you cool. You can't buy brownie that you told me about first. You're the first person to tell me about 11 hydroxy. That eating we're eating. We'd when you eat wheat, it goes through your liver and kidneys and it actually turns a chemical process and it turns

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       the psychoactive chemical thc into another chemical called 11 hydroxy metabolite and that 11 hydroxy is two to five times more psychoactive than the canvas. Actually it's three to five times was the estimate I saw out of the uNiversity of Mississippi and you don't get a thcv. I mean a 11 hydroxy in your bloodstream when you smoke cannabis. It's so. It's such a different experience and you're definitely talking about it. One night, I don't remember what the context of the conversation was, but it was probably. I ate something that was just too fucking strong and you had to explain it. It's so many people have had it and they're like, it's a mama, I'm on acid or something. It does not feel like pot and you're not used to it because when you smoke pot, you're only used to dealing with thc in your bloodstream and that to you and not 11 hydroxy front man, nothing you should fear.

Speaker 1:          01:06:04       We were on a, we were at a plane the other day. We were flying to austin, Texas and a rat ate a cookie in his car on the way to the airport. And then, uh, he got there and you know, it takes an hour and 20 minutes or so to kick in. He got there. We were on the plane, on the tarmac and he was seriously thinking about telling them that they had to let him off the plane because he's that high. Oh no. Until we landed some model, did that. The other day I saw dave chappelle did a to a dave chappelle. Had a panic moment on the plane. I got to get off. It might have been that, you know, that's one of those things that you wonder if you really want to go. I'll go with it though. What if you get off the plane?

Speaker 1:          01:06:37       The plane crashed as you book. Thank you baby. Jesus. I'm not religious. No. It would be a moment. You know, I guess parachutes high flux so it would save george bush's father, his parachute and the first draft of the declaration of independence was drafted. Him know motherfucker integral part of our history men. And this is why I'm trying to convince people that you needed that had no other options. Canvas was the only thing they had. There was no cotton gin when she knitted the first american flag. You know, we, we only need look at our history's time table to realize what we were using before the invention of some of these things. This is all lost information, ladies, gentlemen, and if you want to find out more about this, if you're really fascinated, go pick up this book. The emperor wears no clothes. It's a the one that, as we said, was written bar late friend jack herer harris.

Speaker 1:          01:07:26       How you say right now? I think terror. Yeah. Hara. Like terry used to say, you know, was we'd still available to, you know? Yeah. You can still buy a strain is a strain named after him. He is there a time. Mccormick strain out there. Thank god. No, no. Thank god. No god, no. There's a joe rogan out there. I don't know. I don't know where it is. I was just going to say fuck it. I'll give you permission to me, man. This is an officially sanctioned joe rogan's train will be treated. Were created by todd mccormick. Do you want it or indicus tiva? Fucking dope. We just a sprinkle of endeca. Sprinkle some time. Makes you a little silly little sprinkle. I think that's a great idea. I like to research and see what have you. Tried to put this together. Thank you everybody for tuning into the podcast. Once again, thank you to the flashlight for a sponsored. I don't know why I hold this up. Can't just say it. I can just say it, but I feel like it's right here. I have to show you that. It's really does it light? Is it like, no, there's no light. There's no fucking fuck it. Nobody's fucking smell this rubber. Just shower. Oh, that's fucking weird, reverend man. You good man. What's up with that? I'll tell you what's up better for masturbating. Do you masturbate at all? Don't lie. Of course you do. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       But if you masturbate, why wouldn't you want one of these? Because this is masturbation. I could give you a long list of reasons. It just popped right off my head leaning in. Dealing with. This is how you deal with it, right? You open up the top, right? So you shoot your load in there and then you unscrew the bottom and then you release the dishwasher. That dish shuts your sign. You're not getting that clean. The top of it. You shoot it. Oh, the load on your face. You do whatever you want to shoot on your face. I like to think brian plays out with a song. What's the song? Brian?
