Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Oh Shit. We're live ladies gentlemen. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by on it.com. If you go to o, n n I t you can check out all the different products, the new tropics, the uh, sports exercise shit like shroom tech sport, fascinating stuff. It's based on the quarter subs mushroom, which somehow or another, uh, helps your body process oxygen Benner, it gives you a just a bit more endurance. You can feel it, especially if you take four. That's what I do. I take four before Jujitsu, shroom tech sport, check into that shit. If you're really into working out or if you, you're going to high altitude people have had success with that stuff. If there, uh, if you're, if you're like living at sea level and you go into altitude, you can, it takes your body awhile to deal with that. And that's supposedly is where they found this quarter. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       mushroom. The, the, the story behind it was that cattle were eating these mushrooms and they were, uh, a bit more active. And so the, uh, the cattle range of people said, well, what's in these mushrooms? And they started eating them and apparently it helps your body. When you're at a higher altitude, you have less oxygen. It's just a good endurance supplement. Not, you know, it's nothing crazy, but it gives you a boost so you can feel, um, what does, what is Alpha brain, all this stuff. The information is much more, it's much better described by the people in on it. If you go to the website, check it out, look into it. If you try it and you don't like it, there's a 100% money back guarantee on the first order of 30 pills.

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       My version of on it would be a totally different website if it was me describing it or if you were describing it and mine would be like, Yo, I'm taking new mood. Did a bunch of x this not this weekend. Help you when you did x, did it help you brain? Well, I think if you're, if, if you remember roll on and roll off and all that stuff like that, that that's what you know, it's the, the, it's, it helps, it helps your brain grow back. What it needs to grow back in my website and your website. It gets my brain juice going again.

Speaker 1:          00:02:07       All of them, Alpha brain and new mood, all these nutrients. It's nutrients that that aid in your brain's ability to produce neurotransmitters. And I always say that that coming out of my mouth is just a bunch of noise. I'm just repeating things that smart people have said. I'm not really smart enough to understand the, even the idea of neurotransmitters, what they really are. So I shouldn't even be allowed to use that word. But since that is what scientifically, that's how it's described, I use that word. So just understand it's coming from the mouth of an idiot who's really into vitamins, but it works. Uh, check it out. Use a code name. Rogan, save yourself 10% off. We also have a kettle bells and battle ropes. And, and uh, I've talked about these many times in the podcast. One of the things that I think if you really like lifting weights with one of the things that's cool about lifting weights as you can with your willpower, take your body and turn it into a stronger, better body, like a body that works really well.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       And I said to a friend of mine, we were having this discussion about this and he's, he doesn't work out. And I was like, if you could take a pill that could instantly turn you into like a super athlete and instantly turned you into like a Michael Jordan, you know, would you take that pill? Well you can, like someone can be Michael Jordan. You just have to work out as hard as that guy did. Like it can be accomplished. Like you can transform your body into a body that works better. Like you really can, not with a pill, but with your app, your own will, your own will and exercises. And my favorite way to work out is with kettlebells and that's why we started selling them an on a.com. Um, I think for functional strength, it's one of the best exercises in the world. It's all your, everything that you do with kettlebells pretty much is your use your whole body as one unit to move this cannon ball around.

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       There's hundreds of videos online for free on youtube if you want to buy him. Steve Maxwell has excellent ones, is a guy named Mike Muller. He's got excellent ones. All different videos that can show you how to workout with kettle bells. And it's, in my opinion, one of the best workouts for your body, for anything where if you, if, if it would help you in whatever you do, whether it's a sport, you know, whether it's at work, if you have to pick things up at work a lot, if it would help you to be stronger and to, to have a body that can move things heavier, better than kettlebells are going to aid you. For me and Jujitsu made a huge difference in my endurance, like, uh, the, my ability to, to, to keep going, uh, in like high pressure rolls when you're rolling with somebody who's really good, something like kettlebells makes a big difference and you're focusing on the alien freaking people out.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       And, uh, alienware's not our sponsor, but a sucker punch entertainment hooked us up with these cool Alienware laptops and we uh, we like them because Alienware uh, is a, a big company and they support them and may fighters. So, so we're kissing their butts so we're kind of kissing their ass. Yeah. So that's it. You dirty bitches. Go to [inaudible] dot com get yourself some weights. Get you swole on. You know what I'm saying, son? Get your battle ropes and gear. Justin Helpern is here and we're going to get down to the nitty gritty about the San Diego Los Angeles Commute. And what's the difference between these two mother fuckers? Give me a sec. Oh yeah. Use a Coney Rogan experience trying my day. Joe Rogan podcast. That was probably the worst one ever. Dj Red Bin. No, it was, it was interesting. It was definitely, you definitely threw a curve ball. I need to get more sound effects or something. Yeah, you shoot your fucking awesome. Know what you got buddy. Your Echo, echo and fade that's underneath it. It's perfect. So old school, Justin, what's up man?

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       How you doing? Thanks for having me. I'll please. Thank you. Thanks for on. So you were, you're the dude to created the shit. My Dad says Twitter account, which became a cultural phenomenon as you man. Yeah, no, it's crazy. It was just that I was just, I was a bad mother fucker. I listen, that's me. My Dad is, I dunno. Is it all really stuffy says or do you kind of juice it up a little bit of right now and then,

Speaker 4:          00:06:20       oh, you edit it to get into the 140 characters and Twitter. Cause like he couldn't talk his sentiments. Yay. I definitely, I mean he, he would fucking flip out if I, if I, he cause he checks it like once every two months to make sure it's like stuff that he said. So

Speaker 3:          00:06:37       how does he feel about this man that's gotta be a trip all of a sudden your, your, your, your likeness is being portrayed on television by Captain Kirk.

Speaker 4:          00:06:46       Yeah. That he, that he was like, the show is shitty and I don't, I don't totally disagree, but, uh, he didn't, he honestly didn't give a shit about William Shatner or the TV show it all. He liked the book that I wrote. He was like into that. He's more into reading than he is watching TV. Have you ever thought about putting a camera on him? Does he want to do that? He would hurl it to the ground. Yeah. He's not, he's not into that at all. He's just, he really that guy. Yeah. I mean he weird line though. You've, you've kind of drawn, you know, you've like depicted him. Yeah. Well I was really worried about telling Niggas ain't even tell him at first, you know, first couple of months I didn't think I just, it was for my friends, so I was like, nobody's going to see this, so there's no, we're, I shouldn't bother him with it.

Speaker 4:          00:07:30       And then when it's like blew up and people were like, Hey, are you interested in doing a book? I was like, well, I should tell my dad first. When did you start the Twitter account? It is crazy. I started in August, 2009 and by I think like August 21st I started August 3rd August 21st I had like 300,000 followers. It was nuts. Like it just went viral and then probably like two weeks later, is that a million? Holy Shit. Yeah, it was. It was like right when Twitter was like, you remember that like Ashton Kutcher race to a million? Like that kind of bullshit was going on and and so it was like, it was in the news. Like if it happened now, I don't know. But, but back then it was like perfect timing. Wow. It's amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:08:11       That's incredible. So just out of the word of mouth, basically people just sharing it with themselves. It literally went viral to a million people.

Speaker 4:          00:08:19       Yeah. Yeah, it did. I think like it was at like 10,001 day when I went to, I went to bed, it was at 10,000 and then rob Corddry tweeted it and then he like tweeted a link like I like this. And it was rob Corddry rob, of course, he's like comedian. He, he was like a hot tub time machine and the daily show and stuff. He was just like, uh, I'm sure I know him. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you cross paths with him at some point and he had like a million followers or something. And so when he tweeted it out, then all of a sudden the next day it was like 100,000 is kind of just going faster and faster and people kept sharing it and then it was like, all right, well what am I going to do now? How old were you when this was going on?

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       29. Wow. And was, what is this like, I mean, you're sitting there going, okay, what do I need that, what would it, what do I do with this? Yeah, well I was living at home, so like I was, I was riding for Maxim and I was living at home. I just split up with my a girl or sheets, whatever was made to be more frank. Um, and, uh, and so I just like didn't know what the fuck I was gonna do cause I was just sitting there and I was like living in my childhood bedroom. It was like really depressing. So yeah. And then when all this stuff started happening, you know, I'd been riding for a while and I had been up here riding and waiting tables and doing all that stuff and then been writing for magazines last couple of years before that. And then this guy reached out to me and he's like, maybe you could, you know, is there, maybe there's a book in this.

Speaker 4:          00:09:40       And so then I started to sort of sit down and write some essays about just stories up me and my dad and then sort of submitted them. How many stories do you have? I got a lot of stories. He's crazy. Um, but uh, for the book I wrote like 12 essays. So like if that book was single spaced and in like normal font, it'd be like nine pages. But, but, but uh, yeah, I mean, I, that book was like, yeah, around 12 or 13 essays, maybe like 160, 170 pages. And I kinda just tried to keep ones that didn't feel redundant. So

Speaker 3:          00:10:11       is your dad just like always on about everything? Does he always have something funny to say about everything? Is he just that guy all day?

Speaker 4:          00:10:19       Nah, he, he's not, he's not like, he'll be just like quiet for two hours and then he'll just like explode on you. Um, he just like a lot of Shit pisses him off. Right. You know, and so, and he doesn't have a lot of people to talk to because he doesn't have any friends. So yeah. For my mom, uh, I mean that's the way he wants it though. Like he doesn't, he doesn't want, yeah, he really doesn't. He's like my best. He's like, my best friend lives in Tennessee. I see him once a year. I'm like, that's it. That's not a good, best friend. I think the ball, why has he chosen? That's, that's mean that behavior is a cause. Like Jude not want to have friends. He just would rather be able to not say like say whatever he wanted unfiltered, but he always just tells the truth.

Speaker 4:          00:10:59       So you kind of lose a lot of friends along the way. You would think you would gain him. He the ones he has like two or three and they're super close. Like they're grizzle all guys that say shit like I died for you. You're like, when would that ever come up? But okay. So yeah. But I mean like he, he, he's not, so he's not always on, but yo, he's got really like interesting. He grew up in the south and, but he's a doctor, so like he grew up on a farm. He was in the military. He was like a tobacco farmer until he was like, you know, 1516 so, you know, I think he's got a unique perspective.

Speaker 3:          00:11:33       Wow. Yeah. That's a pretty intense life. But he doesn't want to do anything publicly. He doesn't want to like be, you know, I mean if you ever interviewed him on anything,

Speaker 4:          00:11:43       Yeah. You know, I did for this, for my second book that came out, I did a, I was like, well, I was like, you didn't want like you have a lot of fans, you want to do that? Like nobody gives a shit about me. Like they want to see you, do you want to like, I was like, do you want to do like a video interview or something? That's if you buy the Ebook, you get like, you know, whatever. And he was like, I'll do it if it's you, me and the camera. And I'm like, well what about somebody to run the camera? He's like, fucking, I'm out. Like, all right, fine. I'll run the camera and be inner. Yeah. So I was like me turning on the camera and then running over and sitting in the thing.

Speaker 3:          00:12:13       Wow. What is, he just doesn't want another person in the room. He just doesn't get along with people that well. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:12:20       So he's just a grizzled old dude. Like I feel like maybe that's how they made them back then. I don't know. But, uh, I mean, like the thing, the weird thing is if you came up to him on the street, he'd be like a perfect gentleman. You know? Like he'd be totally, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:12:33       Who would he be keeping it together? He doesn't really want to talk to you. Not really going to be rude to you. He just doesn't really want to. So he picks out a couple of people, like his family and he's like, this is it. This is, these are the people I talked to. Yeah. They're not talking to anybody else. Yeah. That's how my grandfather was also really, my grandfather was really just like one of those like, scream at your wife doors, get over here and just like, not like, I'm not a happy, I grew up with a grandfather who was a, he's a great guy, but him and his wife fought like cats and dogs. It was crazy. My grandparents, you still fucking scream at each other. They would scream at each other that I was like, fallout four, five, you know, it was like this little monkey watching these crazy old Italians don't wash be Zhao, don't you fucking rush Mary screaming at my grandfather. I'm like, whoa. That's what I remember. I remember at a very early age going, Whoa, the relationships can go this far south. Fuck man,

Speaker 4:          00:13:34       dude. I think, I feel like people back then, they used to do like, they love each other. Yeah. It's a little harder life and nobody's getting divorced as much as they are now.

Speaker 3:          00:13:42       Yeah. It's a totally different world, man. It was a dangerous, scary world back then. That was it. That, you know, they lived, they lived through the world wars, the depression, like that kind of shit. My grandparents came over here during the depression, you know, that's like, that's when they arrive. They arrived like right in the middle of the shit. So the fact that they were saying it all, you know, the fact that they made it through and had family and actually have those family like go off and that survive on their own in the wild. It's incredible.

Speaker 4:          00:14:10       Yeah. I feel like it was, I mean, I know it sounds Kinda like cliche to say it, but it was just a way harder existence. Yeah. You had to be way tougher.

Speaker 3:          00:14:17       You had it to be, you had to be someone who dealt with a lot more tragedy, that's for sure. Yeah. For the most part, you know, he just, you know, you, I think the world was just a harsher, more, you know, more animalistic place almost back then. You didn't want to hear any, we didn't want to hear any bullshit. Yeah. It's unfortunate, man. So many people from those really hard errors grew up without much joy. You know, they have like funny shit to say. What is this angry, fucked up funny. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:14:45       Well my dad was a, he grew up on a tobacco farm when he was like 10 he worked the farm, you're like 10 he fell off a wagon and rolled over her arm and it crushed his elbow. When they took him to the doctor, the doctor's told his dad, he was like, I can amputate his arm and he'll live for sure. Or I can give them like these, this medication, and maybe there's only a 30% chance that he lives. And he said his dad was like, let 'em die. There's no, there's no room in the world for one arm farmer.

Speaker 1:          00:15:11       Holy Shit. Holy Shit.

Speaker 4:          00:15:15       Just like how it was back then. The doctor was like, all right, cool. And then just, it gives him the stuff. Wow. Yeah. That was his dad's had let them die. Yeah. He said, let him die. There's no room in the world for one arm farmer.

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       Holy Shit. Imagine thinking that when you're 10 that you, you, you're not even, no one cares about you. Your arm is broken. And then like, let them die

Speaker 4:          00:15:36       as, this is how crazy my dad is. When he told me that story, I was like, that's so fucked up. He's like, what are you talking about? He saved my arm. I'm like, are you insane? Like that's, Oh my God,

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       Jesus Christ. I've been watching all these documentaries recently about neanderthals, you know, and about, uh, you know, this is like people that are talking about not like, they're pretty much pretty sure that most white people have some percentage of neanderthal in us. And imagine if you for some reason had to go back to that time and survive. Imagine how hard that would suck to be making spears with fucking rocks and animals seeing you. I mean, would you just like take your clothes off and just walk into the ocean and drown and would you just give up? I mean, would you even want to get to today?

Speaker 4:          00:16:28       I've actually thought a lot about that cause I was like, I thought about like how far back in time I'd have to go to actually be able to invent anything. That was cool and I don't know how to, anything works. I just used those. I would, if that was the case. Yeah, I would just, Oh, do what you say.

Speaker 1:          00:16:42       Think like, man, do I really, I think your, your survival instincts would kick in, but you know, you wouldn't have this, you know, this esoteric search for happiness is deep search for how like everybody has. Like I just don't know where I'm at at this point in my life. Like, okay, you know why? Because there's no fucking struggle. You're getting through your day hopping in your range rover with your little tiny dog and there's just no real struggle. Okay, so you're confused and you're sad and you might be happier if you were chasing animals with a fucking point. You stick. Yeah. You might be happy if you are running a farm. You might be, might be ma'am.

Speaker 4:          00:17:19       I mean you can even see it today and like really shitty countries. Nobody's like, hmm, should I pursue a law degree? You're like, no, I just want to stay alive.

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       Just fucking stay alive. Yeah, there's a Lotta, there's a lot of weirdness to this life. I know this life is w we, we might not be set up to handle it. You know, we might not be set up to, to deal with all the pressures that technology and society and all this, all this information that's coming at us all the time. Not might not be set up for that shit.

Speaker 4:          00:17:51       Well it's like you were saying before we started like people get crazy when they get online.

Speaker 1:          00:17:56       Yeah. Some people do. It's a, some people it's like thick had finally lash out. They could fuck the world back. Like the world's fucking them, you know, they just feel like the world fucks them. Like everywhere they turn it's like this is not working out. You know, you're, you're looking at television, you know, that's not my life. You know, you're looking at there. The reality is most people out there not doing exactly what they want to do and they want to be angry at somebody and all day the most of them work. And if you're working, most of the time you have to keep your fucking mouth shut. You can't say what you want to say. You can't, you're in an office. So with a bunch of people you could actually get sued for trying to crack jokes. You know, you can't say anything sexual, you know, if you do, you're going to go to court. I ain't going to get sued for sexual harassment. It's like it's really restrictive environment and then they get online, they don't like you fucking suck, fucking kill yourself, drown in aids. And it's like these, it is concentrated attack on like Brittany Spears or you know, or anybody. That's what it is. It's like this just fucking this, this little volcano of hate. It just pops out. It's because he's poor folks live a shit life.

Speaker 4:          00:19:10       I had ones when she might add, says first started getting popular and uh, like I got a, I got a book deal out of it and uh, I was checking at replies the day it did and this guy had filled up, cause you can only have 140 characters per tweet. Right. He had filled up like 15 or 20 tweets just to haul caps. Faggot. This is actually my dad's us. It was just nonstop. Uh, he like, he spent like probably like 10 or 15 minutes just doing nonstop. But there's something funny about that though. Did you laugh laughing? Like I took a screenshot of it and set it all my friends and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:19:47       That's fucking great man. That is great. When it's silly bitch.

Speaker 4:          00:19:52       Is there a, a tweet that you did that it's your favorite one that you still like look back and I'm like, man, that was great. And that's like one in particular? Yeah, I mean there, cause like for me, he's, he said them to me, you know, so I was like, there's context to it and stuff. And this one time he, he, he, he like loves our dog more than like people in and he brought our, he took the dog to the dog park. He walked in one day I'm sitting on the couch and he's like, he's like, well, I guess, uh, were, were banned from the dog park. And I was like, Oh fuck. What happened? He's like, I guess it's okay to Barak and it's okay to hump, but if you do both at the same time, it freaks people out. It's just like the thought of my dog is like angrily raping other dogs like there. And then my dad is somebody having to come to my dad say something about it. Like it wasn't what he said that was so funny on me. It was just like that scenario. We laugh. That's,

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       you were one of the first, uh, uh, Twitter followers that I remember that. Like, what's it like? Cool. Like I found this, this, this, the hilarious Twitter. And then my girlfriend, I told her at her at the time and she was like, oh my God, this is the best thing ever. And she told her, Megan, I just watched it like, like become like something I thought I found myself. And then growing to just being everywhere. You were pretty much being retweeted by every single person. I know at one point, uh, have you, cause I have you,

Speaker 4:          00:21:17       yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:21:17       Like are you over it now? Are you [inaudible] gotten to a point where you're like, I just want to write books now and, or, or is it, do you, are you still in love with Twitter doing the Twitter thing?

Speaker 4:          00:21:27       I mean I gotta be honest like it, it was such a lucky break for me that I sort of just feel, I mean it sounds cheesy, but I feel just like really grateful for everything that's happened. So to me it's never like it didn't wear off and like, ah, I do this, I got this dumb thing here. It's like, well that fucking made my whole career. So yeah, I mean to me I still, I don't do it as much, but I definitely don't have like that same kind of feeling where it's like I'm over this. So like something that I really connect with, I guess he must've been so site. Do you totally hit the lottery? It was exotic. It was exactly like hitting the lottery. There really was.

Speaker 5:          00:22:01       That's amazing. What did you want to do before you did that? Did you always want to be a writer?

Speaker 4:          00:22:05       Yeah, I had worked up here. I'd waited tables in La and I like I had sold a screenplay and like quip stupidly quit my job and then had to go back to it. I have to run out of money, but like I had been, you know, struggling as a, as a screenwriter for a while and then, and uh, so this was exactly what I wanted to do, you know, sort of like gifted to me. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:22:25       Wow. And from there you do, how do you get this TV deal? How's that happen and how do they did William Shatner to play your dad and like where did it all go? A foul? Because it's a, it's, it's a fascinating that they've found a way to make something that's really funny. Not that funny. No, it's true. I mean it's really like, that's exactly

Speaker 4:          00:22:44       wait would happen. It's like find the center and pour water. Um, it, uh, you know, like I wrote the book proposal and I had sent it out just as a book and the book was just like, are rated like the Twitter feed, you know, but with stories. And then as soon as it got out there, then network started calling being like, we want to do this. And I remember saying to my, I have a screenwriting partner. I remember saying to him, I'm like, how could we do this on a network? It, he's says fuck every other word, like we can't do it on a network. And, and then, uh, and then I was like, wait, I need to just shut up and it just like do this, you know, and try and, uh, it just, I remember early on we sat with the standards and practices person at CBS cause we ended up, I pitched it and we sold the CBS and, and uh, when we sold the standards and practices person was like, all right, here's the list of words that you can't say or even like intimate, you know, and uh, intimate and, and uh, it was like everything he says.

Speaker 4:          00:23:41       And I was like, all right, this is, that's ridiculous. This is gonna suck

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       about your conversation with the standards of practices. Person can be mad. Dang. Yeah. Usually like why you can't blind, it's really, it's amazing what you can and can't say. What people don't understand is like cable, you can say anything. Yeah. And the only reason why they don't say everything is just their own discretion. It's the idea that sponsors don't want to be on a show that, you know, says fucking cunt and whatever. So, but the FCC doesn't regulate cable.

Speaker 4:          00:24:13       Yeah, it's crazy. I mean, yeah, it was, I guess. And I also like, because after we did that, when we got Shatner to s to set to star in it, um, I was like, well maybe you know, like he'll, it'll when coming through his mouth it will sound different. But it was just like, my dad's like unintentionally funny. He's not like cracking jokes really in Sitcoms, you know, it's like set up punchline set up punchline and it, and it just didn't fit that format at all.

Speaker 3:          00:24:38       I think with Hbo and Showtime, I think in that works look ridiculous. Tried trying to just only use limited language like, and with movies and like what kind of a fucking stupid anti evolutionary concept does that, oh, we're going to pretend forever that these words are forbidden. Like really, we live in a 2012 of the Internet and we've got forbidden words. You can't broadcast them. And if they, if you do, they can come and take your numbers. Who will take your numbers away? You know what the fuck kind of science fiction movie is this. There's certain sounds you can't make with your mouth. There were illegal. Even though the indistinguishable from, you know, other words that you can get away with saying, I mean everybody knows exactly what the fuck you're talking about, but if you say it with a certain sound, certain sound that comes out of your mouth, I think it's getting better, but it's still the same.

Speaker 3:          00:25:29       You can't say can't on television. Yeah, I bet at capital happened. Can't see she's up can't because sometimes someone's a cunt. You know, you can't say that. You could never say that on television now there there's no substitution. There's no substitution for that word in the right context, the right forum, he should be allowed to use it. Do you think about the right word? Got dammit. Do you think it would happen though? I think it would happen like right before a woman becomes president. That will probably go through whenever we had. It's not legislation where going to pat, you should be able to use all the words so it's so stupid. It should always be about intent. And what is your intent? What are you, what are you trying to say? It shouldn't be about words. Shouldn't be about magic words. That's craziness. You're, you're artificially giving these words power and making them ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          00:26:13       Eliminating them from all discourse during the day. You know, while you're at the business who can't be, you know this fucking hunting coffee machine can't say that. That's why I went to like that old guy that was a selling Winnebagos. You remember that dude? Yes. I or another viral sensation. You ever seen that Brian? Yeah. The guy is awesome, right? Why is it awesome? Because he's a fucking nice guy. Tried to sell it a be on his ass. A fucking shit. I'm fucking can't remember this fucking pizza shit. And of course I fucked my lines up. You know, he gets going crazy. Really Fun to watch because you're looking at this guy, he was like this button down poor fuck. Who can't swear during the day

Speaker 4:          00:26:50       and you get to see like it's, I think it's like real moments. So that's what's enjoyable. So when I see like a bull shitty sanitize thing on narrow TV, you're like, well, that's not how real people talk or

Speaker 3:          00:27:01       how weird must have been for you because you will, this is coming from your dad who's fucking hilarious to you and you know, so it's inspiring to the, you write all his shit down and put it out to people. People respond to his exact words that millions of them we'll do get onto your Twitter and follow you. So it's very obvious at that combination in the exact form works. But they're like, no, no, no. You got to scrub it with bleach. He just couldn't keep scrubbing it with bleach until you have like this dead version of what it could have been. So stupid.

Speaker 4:          00:27:38       I mean, that's the is exactly kind of stupid.

Speaker 3:          00:27:41       So dumb. They're the same people. You dummies. The same people that subscribed on Twitter or this same people that would watch the TV show are the same people that would buy the products that they're, they're pitching in their commercials. It's the same fucking people to pretend it's not and you're just, you got to do something different by not saying fuck. It's just, it's so dumb.

Speaker 4:          00:28:01       Yeah. It was especially frustrating cause like the Twitter feed had done really well and then the book came out in the book did really, really well and I was like, all right, so the two things that stay exactly true to what our have done well and then they're like, I have, well we're going to change it and we're going to largely at fault just like anyone else. I was like, maybe it can work.

Speaker 3:          00:28:19       Yeah, of course. You wanted to believe it works. You, you hit the lottery. All of a sudden you have a TV show. Of course you wanted to believe it would work. I mean I'm talking total Utopian Society obviously, but I just kind of feel like that has to be one of the things that fucks us up. It has to be when when language is restricted and there's certain words that actually have magical powers, like if you say them someone without doing anything physically, if you say them, people get actually lock you up and find you and do all sorts of things to you if you say them and do the, you know, the jurisdiction of the airwaves. That's that's, that's insanity. That's a crazy notion and the fact that we accept that. It's almost like, except that you accept censorship in any form you're going to, except all the other craziness that goes along with being governed as well.

Speaker 3:          00:29:09       It's like it's important to make it all ridiculous. Like this magic word thing might actually be a key component to keeping people close minded. If you can really convince people that there are magic words, it's such a dumb idea. It might be like a mind prison locks you hit. It locks you up in logic to the point where you're, you're, you're unable to analyze the rest of the world. It's like this complex thing of don't say content. You know? It's like this lock idea, this segment in your brain. You're a box which you choose to only operate in.

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       Yeah, it's so crazy. It's funny too cause like on regular basic cable TV, like sometimes there'll be like the, you know, Hispanic station or whatever and they're saying their version of fucking shit and pussy and con. Yeah they are, but it's in Spanish and so it just, just because I, we, you know, most people don't understand that language. Then it's cool. I got to learn Spanish. That's what it is. I got to learn Spanish.

Speaker 3:          00:30:04       Fuck it. It's just so stupid, man. It's like that's why people are so turning to the Internet, not speak well. That's a terrible sentence. But that's why I think the Internet has so much appeal to especially the younger people. It's like if you grow up with it, it's really hard to go sit calm after you go. You know like the style, project.com never been a style project. He was like the original right style. Yeah. Getting them, it was one of the original, like if there was something fucked up out there on the Internet, he would have it on his website. If some new shit went down, you'd go to his website and he would have it, whatever. It was like,

Speaker 4:          00:30:40       like crazy video situation shit. Yeah. It's like naked girls

Speaker 3:          00:30:45       most fucked up things that dude would have it, but it's, you know, it's out there if you want to look, it's,

Speaker 4:          00:30:52       yeah, I mean that's the thing is like I think pretending like it's not out there does no one any favors.

Speaker 3:          00:30:58       So not helping anybody needs these fucking stupid shows where you're not allowed to use all the words like wow. Enough already.

Speaker 4:          00:31:06       Yeah. And the funny thing is is like it just feels like you said it especially dated, it's insulting. It's insulting

Speaker 3:          00:31:13       it where there's, how many wars going on simultaneously and what we want to pretend that like words are bad. This that's so, it's so anti evolution of it. It's so stupid that there was forbidden words. I mean that's, it's such a dumb premise that like if you just accept that and that becomes a major part of your society when you're talking about your ability to communicate, that becomes a major point. And then it's like, well, wait a minute. These words are totally forbid and you can get arrested for him only if you use them in in one certain way if you broadcast them, but you can use them and reach the same amount of people. If you do it on cable or the Internet. That's cool. That's okay. But so it's only censored in one way, but in this one way it's like really bad for you. Like if you get caught like going on the news go, unless you [inaudible] like don't take a lot of money from you, they could find you. You like, you're forcing people to hear that. Like the SOS. There's something to that. The fact that you planned did, it's probably like some first degree type activity. You know, they could probably like find you for a really substantial amount of money for purposely using magic words on, on the radio or on television. That's God. That's maddening.

Speaker 4:          00:32:24       Yeah. It's funny when, uh, uh, I was promoting this book, um, I wanted to s uh, you can send out a tweet that's like promoted so that all of your followers will definitely see it. Cause you know, people log in at different times and you miss tweets and all that kind of stuff. And so I sent out this tweet, it was just a quote, my dad, and then it had like by the book, Blah, blah, blah, after and it had like shit or fucking the quote, I can't remember. And Twitter, it was like, oh, we can't, we can't promote that. We can't show that. And I'm like, but you're showing it to people who already subscribe to my feed. Like Shit. My Dad says in the title, and they're like, yeah, but we can't have, we can't, uh, put something on somebody's feed that has any profanity. I'm like, but it's my fucking, they're already, they're already following me. I'm just making sure they see it. It's like, it's bananas. Like it's, it makes no sense. And that's in there, like worried they're going to get sued. You know?

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       I hope that that's something that the Internet's going to dissolve.

Speaker 5:          00:33:17       Well, it, it's going to, because like that's what NBC is not going to be a television channel in five years. It's going to be nbc.com. It's, it's killing. It's killing the, the live television broadcast, which I know it seems crazy, but it's nbcs not going to have money broadcasting and spending all that money when it's going to be, everyone's going to be on the Internet, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:33:37       Well, you know, some shows I think we'll be successful because it costs a lot of money to make them things like game of Thrones like that, the, you know, that's,

Speaker 5:          00:33:46       that's a really, you need a studio. You need a bunch of bad motherfucker. Yeah. But that's not broad pointing together. Right. Well and that's what's it, that's what's keeping the language. That's what I'm saying. It's that it's the language. It's only because of live free broadcast out like NBC, ABC, CBS. But it's still, I think you're right. I mean even for a network show, if you, if you really want to like it costs a lot of money to do that. Yeah. It was going to say it lost or it's going to say lost. Do you need, you would need like a real studio to make laws. So I ain't mean they're going to have to figure out a way to make money doing it that way. I guess. I mean, what, what do you think is going to happen? No, that's what I'm saying. I'm saying that the only thing that's keeping censorship and, and shit like that off of, of television is the, the those channels.

Speaker 5:          00:34:27       Right. And when you think that they're going to go though, you think there'd be just, they're going to be an HBO work, they're going to become an HBO on a cable, a well your ear or deepen the television industry. You actually like what, what did, what did you executive produced that show or something like that writer and it's like your produce. How does it work? Is it, are we onto that? Is that, I think, I think what's going to end up, I mean, fourth, the fact the line now, but I think it's, uh, to end up being where you can just subscribe to each channel, right? So if you don't have the good shows people want, then fuck you. You Die.

Speaker 1:          00:34:59       You know? For some folks it would be advantageous to, to stick with the way they do it now and like not swear, you know, this is probably a lot of people out there. They'd probably like Dr. Quinn Medicine woman type TV shows and like there's a lot of money in selling those people things. But how do they do that? How they balance that and have like good comedy at the same time. Because if you really want to have good comedy, unless you're some Larry David type genius that can create something like Seinfeld, you know, most of you so straddled down as to what you could have really said and talked about.

Speaker 4:          00:35:35       Here's some good, I mean the fucking radio is one of,

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       I mean there's shows a lucky, crazy experience man. They, they snuck in and we all snuck in and barely got by every year like this show, like never took on, took off at all until it was canceled. And then it did like really good and like repeats. But it was a perfect combination of a really funny show at like a super lucky position to be in. You know, where it's just, but then realizing that that's, that's not even really enough. Like you have to have someone who like, they have to like promote you. You have to get out there too. It's a weird, the world of, uh, creating a sitcom that navigating the waters of where you are at in the lineup and it's a very, very, very tricky situation for success. And they also pump, like I, I was on a show [inaudible] on our show last year that got canceled on CBS after two episodes and there's a fucking terrible shows, a disaster.

Speaker 3:          00:36:31       Some of them are so bad. It's scary. Yeah. This one and this one was, was like that. It wasn't really it, it just was one of the things where it was just a huge cluster fuck. And, and they spent, I mean, this must have spent 5,000 million dollars, like in early promotion for the staff and then two episodes just boom, gone. It's crazy how they do that and it happens all the time. That's why they're so like hands on about shit. Yeah. That's why they're there. You know, it's expensive to make a pilot man. Yeah. That was a part of a super expensive pilot ones where they made a fake jungle set. Wow. It was, yeah, it was a by the same guy who produced a news radio, Paul Simms. It was called overseas or something like that. I think it was called overseas. And uh, it was crazy expensive to make man Leanna, a whole like big fucking studio space.

Speaker 3:          00:37:23       It was trees and they had a pond. They had a fucking pawn. It was so crazy like that. We were going to do this and pretend, I mean, I dunno if it would've worked out all the comedy. Yes. It was common, like lost, but no, no, no. It was like, um, I'm looking at, I don't remember the premise. The premise was something like, I went over there for one reason, but I got stuck because I have a good heart or something like that. And next thing you know, I'm overseas, whatever town, you know, it's just that it's a vehicle to develop comedy. I don't even remember what it was. I don't remember. It was like they were working with orphans. I Dunno what the fuck it was that we were over there doing, but this, this, this idea that they would spend so much money on this pilot, I mean to, to make this fucking set alone.

Speaker 3:          00:38:04       It was ridiculous. It was so big. It was a fucking fake jungle, you know? And like why, how much is this gonna cost? How much it's going to cost all the time. You've got to maintain this fake jungle you have out there. You're going to drain all that water though. I was, the mosquitoes are going to grow in it. The fuck are you doing? But that must mean, you know when it works, it just bucket loads of money. When you find out like what Seinfeld earned, you know, I don't want to blow up his spot, but that dude made some money and you go, whoa, like a real hit, like a Seinfeld. There's, that's like,

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       they're printing money. It's just, whoa. It's like, it's crazy. It's like, what do you like came up to a little boy. How much money do you want? I want $100 billion. Here's $100 billion. Wow. It's so crazy that you can make that kind of money from a sitcom. Yeah. It's funny I was on, I was working at Warner Brothers at the time when Charlie Sheen was going bat shit. Right. Oh that must've been awesome. It was crazy cause you'd sometimes see him and it was like this are, you saw him like come in as whacked one time banging on the studio door. There was no one there though. And I just fucking kept driving. I'm like cough card cause I was like I don't want to, I don't even want to be witnessed to this. Like whatever. But it was making so much money and I remember people were like, is he going to come back?

Speaker 5:          00:39:21       Is it not going to come back? I'm like dude, it's coming back. They'll figure it out. They'll make up fucking CGI Charlie Sheen and no come back cause it's making so much money for people. Well it's interesting. They just moved on to Ashton Kutcher and everybody's like that's cool. We'll take it. I'm like, it's still really fun. And we like it. We don't need to. Charlie is it doing good now? I don't even know where it was doing really good. Yeah. I think it's still, the link's doing great. I think it's doing great. It's weird why Ashton Kutcher's funny. You know, he can act as a handsome fella. Great Bone structure. I think that would be very pleasing to the ladies. You know, I think they like it. I think everything had worked out well. They got, you know Charlie Charlie's a little crazy. It's probably turned a lot of those gals off.

Speaker 5:          00:40:03       You know, like I want to support the show, but that Charlie Sheen and his behavior, it's a conundrum, you know, I don't want to support that. Oh Joe, I'm sorry. I was gonna choose a subject to completely, so when you did your father, you derailed it. We're in the middle of a good God damn Charlie Sheen breakdown Charlie Sheen and figuring out what's really going on. I was thinking, cause you have sheen fever. I just, something popped in my head right now and I was like, oh, I remember we had that conversation of all these people have been telling me they would fuck George Clooney, Clooney, like guys that we know and I couldn't remember who one was Brendan Walsh shirts. I just remembered Sam triple. He said he would fuck Obama if he could. Jesus think you're even supposed to say that. Yeah, you got [inaudible]. You can't see that dude.

Speaker 5:          00:40:51       Don't say that. Well, I was told I didn't say it. I really don't think you can even say that. Like have sex with the president. Yeah. That's one of those things that be you. You're kind of like you. You're not allowed to saying that you, you can, it is illegal to state that you would want to assassinate or do harm to, but I think it's probably rape in the but is probably in there too. No, no. I think you can. I think what Sam means, like if you say that the same umbrella, that's like a terrorist threat dude. I think what Sam was saying is that that Obama would want to have sex with them. Like if he was gonna take up, a lot of it came to them and like came up and was like, oh damn. When we were allowed to imply that. Especially considering the fact that he's married and has children. Well if he probably illegal to imply that it's probably

Speaker 6:          00:41:33       is no salt on [inaudible]. You can't fuck Obama in any way or leave him alone. Man, I didn't know I want to stay for the record that I did not want. I'm not the one that said at Sam Tripoli did. He shouldn't talk like that. It said smart people, they go, there's no need for that guy was like, I around just what is it? What kind of ideal planting out there in society. You don't want to be the list with the under the heading of people who said they'd fuck Obama, Chad. Dude, it's a small list to, you'd be surprised. I bet by the time they get to me, oh, there's only five people that said it. Oh Shit. I bet. One out of every girl, every two girls would want have sex with a mama. They've decided that, well if you put it that way, smoothie, oh I forgot.

Speaker 6:          00:42:22       I was thinking in my head, what would it be like one hour three and I was like, no one do we have to figure out a fake number five. But about 80% of the people would you say no 90 you think 50% of the population of women would want to fuck Obama if they, if no one could find out? Yeah. This would be a lot. It'd be a big number. First of all, if you know, if they both were like on a deserted island or some point though, if you got him into some crazy fantasy situation, a bone might be able to fuck 99% of the women king of the hill though. Yeah, he wins. Yeah. It's like this is probably some gay women who would fuck them. Oh for sure. For sure. Just sort of story. You know, especially the gay women that are gay because like every guy that ever met an asshole, there's those guys too, you know.

Speaker 6:          00:43:10       They was, I called them give up gaze the render. Yeah, girls just meet too many Douche bags and I'm like, I give up, I'm going gay. Cause girls will do that. They can do that man. See I think what, what Sam's thinking is that like Obama would get one room at the w and then he would get the one that's connected to it, you know? And they would just both on lock it in the morning in the middle and then Sam would come in there were like wearing no clothes and just start, you know like going down on Obama, something like that. That's what I, I think that's illegal too. You know you're going to have a drone flying above your head. Stupid. I want you to stop. You really need to stop. I think, well I didn't say it the same for whoever this guy is.

Speaker 6:          00:43:49       He trying to send up the river by talking through his mouth. Maybe what he said then you should have told them. Listen my friend, how about you keep this fucking shit to yourself. Oh, we're all going to wind up in the [inaudible] Bay. Maybe that's journal material. They're going to dress you up in a burka, the dude and stick you in a box. You're just going to disappear. And this is all allegedly, I don't remember what exactly. I don't know what I know that Sam said he wants to have, he would have sex with Obama. Well I think I'd have to be mutual and I think that wrong. Just trying to be funny and I don't think he was successful. That's what I say. I said it's just ridiculous. It's actually the present. How dare you, but it's okay to say having sex with Bill Clinton right now, right? Yes. Yeah. You can say,

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       you could say like if you're a girl, like you'd look to, you do whatever you want to start Clinton's deck. Cause he likes that too. But you don't get in trouble. You don't think so? No. I think it's, everybody just keeps it on the hush hush. Now they know what happens when it gets out. You don't want that. You don't want to be Lewinski skiing nettle. Right? Yeah. That's so crazy. Like, even today, like you say her name and I was like, oh, come on the dress. Boom, Sherlock lock, boom. What a nutty time man.

Speaker 3:          00:45:00       What a strange time in our world where everything got so desensitized that everyone in the world was able to get the information that there was calm on the dress and that she sucked on his cock. Like there was no question. So everybody talked about the whole country, the whole country. So she sucked. His cock can come in the dress. She shucked with God. I mean it was a national dialogue the first time ever that any distinct sexual act between someone of royalty, a president of United States of America was even engaging with some sort of sex. But outside of his marriage and with a 20 year old chicken just works there. Oh my God, he's a look. Stir like this isn't a guy in a band. This is the fucking president United States. And he's going like straight Mick Jagger on this chick. That's, that's incredible, right? If you really stop and think about it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:56       Yeah, I, you know, it's funny, I never thought of it like that, but it really is. It's like that's the basis from Boston has that story.

Speaker 3:          00:46:05       Yeah, exactly. The basis from Basel. It's perfect. That's perfect feed. Yeah, man, we, our whole world changed. It was like, okay, okay, okay, what is really going on? And people don't give a fuck really. Well they didn't because he was doing a good job as a president and they're like, well listen, everybody heard the stories about John F. Kennedy and how about the most of these guys? In order to get to that position, you've got gotta be some kind of a freak. You gotta be some kind of a crazy guy that wants to be at the head and the leader, even if it's for the right reasons. Even if it's like with complete good justice and grace and you're doing all the right way to get to the very top to very activity, too many tippity top, you gotta be a little crazy. You just got to, you got to be to even want to be there to even want to be the guy runs shit. You've got to be to be the guy who says, I know there's 300 million people, but everybody sit the fuck down because I'm going to talk now only me to 300 million and I'm your leader. I'm the leader. I'm the leader of 300 million people. Are you talking about how was that possible? This is a crazy position to be in. You have to be a crazy person to acquire that position. You have to be crazy to chase it.

Speaker 2:          00:47:18       Yeah. I mean if you heard any of your friends be like, I want to lead 300 million people, they'd be like, you're a fucking psychotic narcissist. You'd be out of your fucking mind. Get outta here. Stupid.

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       It just, it's almost like the job only exists for people who are like real live superheroes who are really going to try to change the world and people are completely full of shit. Like that's it. It's the only caught selling room. It's, there's no room for anything else. There is now a lot of middle there. It's like, it's like people who aren't even a real person, they just go in and they, you know, that game that you play, we try to almost touch hands, you know, he tried to like see like back. I would try to see how much you can keep it together. Like how crows close, you can get an anticipate each other's movements. That's what they're doing. But their particular line steppers that's what's going on. Yeah, that's it. It's just takes a huge ego. Yeah. You've got to be crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:48:13       That the idea that you're going to run that whole giant mass of humans, that's nuts. You gotta be fucking crazy to even attempt that because even the dumbest smallest decision you make every day affects tons of people. Will they all go gray like almost instantly, the first couple of weeks they're like, oh, the fucking pressure of, you know, saluting people and you're end up fucking air force one and you're flying around the world and you realize the reality of what's really happening. You know, and you hear the body counts and you, you hear the numbers counts that how much money and the defense contractor budgets and this fucking craziness and that craziness and they're using drones and now you got to go on TV and pretend Osama bin Ladin just got killed.

Speaker 3:          00:49:01       You know, they didn't girls all by law and just shut the fuck up. The guy had been dead forever. That was, that was one of the dumbest things ever drowned him. He really, really, we got no pictures just because we don't want them to know. We really think that, yeah, I don't believe it. I say horse shall you always believed the opposite. I say shitty things, but that one, that one, I say horse shit. The reason why I say horseshit is because there was so many people that were saying that guy was dead already. There were saying that he was under going dialysis. They're saying, right. Yeah, like a big fucking kidney man. And then there's other people that have said this photos, they, they're using that. They say there's a one video of the guy watching television in his apartment and it's like, oh, it looks like it's a song been lawn.

Speaker 3:          00:49:48       They're saying, no, no, no. That's my friend. I know this guy, this guy, he looks like him. Everybody looks like him. When they get to be a certain age, you know, I mean, they all look like Osama bin Ladin at a certain age. We get crazy beers. It's like, you know, that's just a certain look and there's not a lot of distinct features in a fucking giant beard. That's when, when I have my own beard, when I grow my beard out, it covers your whole face. It's like this big crazy mass of hair and everybody with a big crazy massive hair looks pretty fucking similar. You know, just most of it's just crazy hair. So he's like, this is not though some, I've been loving this. She's my friend and not him. It wasn't his house the other day. I don't know if they really did, but I think that would be

Speaker 6:          00:50:28       a story that if I, if I, you know, wanted to release the frack that Osama bin Laden was dead, I would hold onto it for awhile and then I pretend maybe they needed, they needed to shoot one of the people there that were not supposed to be shooting. Maybe that was, that's what was going on. And then they, then they were like, oh, we got him. Maybe, maybe they were just testing out some new fucking ways to Jack People. They went awry, you know, they crashed a helicopter. They were like, look, we've got some good news and bad news. The bad news is we crashed a helicopter. It good as it is. We just killed Osama bin. Ladin me. Well they had that dude on ice. They were waiting like we need, we need a time when we're going to break out this and just use it as I get out of jail free pass.

Speaker 6:          00:51:10       It's got like a special button. He pitches and then they fucking, they open up the freezer, bring out this frozen popsicle, Osama bin Ladin and it takes some pictures with him. Come on man. And then they throw him in the water. All. Okay, cool. Yep. All right. I believe you. You don't have to show me anything. That was the weirdest thing. That was the weirdest thing to me. It was just like they went through this crazy thing of like searching for years and years and years, but then they're like, you know what? We got to get him in the water. Like now what, what was really frightening to me was a, when all the people were cheering like on the streets in like DC near the Capitol and they were going Jew who has hey. And I was walking and I was like, wow, how many of those people are getting paid to do that?

Speaker 6:          00:51:54       First of all, is it a little like professional cheerleaders that they brought in from like the most communist schools? Possibility to accent them in. Got Everybody fired up about you say you say it's ridiculous. It was packed. And the funny thing is like they would, they would, they wanted to show it like on CNN stuff, but then every once in a while it'd be like the most drunk frat dude ever. Like come up and look just like deviled bird. But the camera Justin in your pharmacy, sorry, it becomes a, you know, a cultural event, you know, it's one of those whatever you, yeah, it's like the, you know, the death of our enemy. That's a huge, it's a huge ticket to pull out. We're going to say nothing. Nothing at all. I was just wondering who do you think killed Biggie? I, you know what? I think he's alive and two POCs alive and they live in Sweden. I liked the way you think, dude. Logic reason you putting it all together. Um, you are, you, are you like politically active at all? Like do you look at this Obama and Mitt Romney election and yeah, I mean like, you know, I have like my views on it. I always think like I'm never like informed enough to like engage with like if somebody gets like crazy then I'm like damn, we're always talking about the defense contractor started this situation but 80 follow your mother fucker. What's a sport? The biggest thing I find like creepy is like, uh, a

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       Romney just kind of reminds me of one of those guys who's like, just like son you a mattress that just like, yeah, you'll love it. And I'm like, anything you want to hear, he'll tell you. So I'm always like, ah,

Speaker 3:          00:53:36       he almost has no shot. He almost has no shot because of the fact that it's going to come out when they start the debates and the real rhetoric and hate starts flying when it gets closer and closer to November. His Dad was born on a fucking farm. Like a, like a cult in Mexico.

Speaker 2:          00:53:55       Yeah. Yeah, I know. That's so crazy. Cause I had read that and then I was like, why isn't that out? And I'm like the first one that told us about this, Brian, was it Bolelli Daniel Bell. Ella. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:54:05       Danieli Bolelli Elliot was telling us about doubt that um, it's, they have these places where they decided they wanted to keep polygamy going. So they moved to Mexico, set up shop. They had whole communities in Mexico.

Speaker 2:          00:54:17       Yeah. And that's where Mitt Romney's dad was born. It's crazy. And just the other, the other day he was just like, he was like, listen man, who was talking to this crowd? It's like my dad's from Mexico. Like I understand where you guys are coming from sort of thinking like, I bet your experiences a little different. Yeah. You're out there with fucking Pedro pound and corn into flour tortillas. Fuck Outta here bitch. You live in on a crazy farm where everybody gets to fuck hundred women. Yeah. He wasn't working. I'm fucking Makina Dora. I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       I mean we're not hating man. You know, I think it's a ballsy ass move to move to another country and set up shop. You know, that's what the, the Mormon society to do. That's a ballsy fuckin move. Imagine how much you must like having three wives to be like, fuck it, I'm moving to Mexico. That's fucking bull. That's the old way, the old way, they can't take away the gods way here. It is written just so really it's, it's, that's the one that's so obviously showing it's pimp hand. Whenever you get like the, I won five wives or unlimited about a wise man. Come on man. What's really going on? He shows his pimp

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       ever like I, I've thought about it many times having the mammary love to have like a Harem,

Speaker 3:          00:55:34       you know like the way the, the salt and her Brunei allegedly rocks it. I always found that to be the most fascinating cause he's not married to any of those. No, he has apparently this, you know when you talk about like Forbes 500 or who's like got the most money, I don't even think they include royal families. I think like these guys have like unreported income. I think they're, they're like, they're beyond our calculations of what's possible when it comes to wealth and what I've heard some people do that have like this kind of money. Let's, no, let's not say any names at all. I heard that they will go and pay like the hottest women on the planet. Let girls were like professional models. They just pay them insane amounts of money like any girl, really beautiful girls. And it may be have posed nude somewhere and just he'll find them and to just say offer to them, they offer them crazy money and so they have to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:56:26       They all, they feel like they have to do it. And the next thing you know that go there and they're are part of like a disco. The guy has his own private disco and so it's fucking bad ass too. Cause you're talking about someone with insane amounts of money, like insane wealth. Everything is gold gilded. Perfect craftsman ship the finest food. Yeah, I thought the most battle Ram. Yeah. And he goes down there and it's just him and he's the guy you know is gold underwear on and he's moving through the crowd and he's paid all of these women essentially to have sex with him at his choosing whenever he likes, when he ever, he likes, he just chooses. So you might fly there and never fuck him. Yeah. Yeah. He might not like you. He might not be into that. He just wants a bunch of them there that are unbelievably hot and you know, depending on who you listen to or which different dude who was rocking it this way, you know they would do, would have like 30 women just waiting and they're like Penn House pets.

Speaker 3:          00:57:21       They're like fucking like legit hot models, not the top of the food. I wish a wish that man would write a book. You know, just like you want to talk about being a baller. I mean if that kind of wrote a book, they be like, that's so let me tell you how I rock it has the name of his book. Let me tell you how the discount that chapter one, this is what you would do if you had, you know, a fucking trillion dollars or whatever this guy has. He's like to pay them a half a million dollars a year is nothing. It's nothing. I was reading this thing that said like Vladimir Putin had like, he just collected a bunch of hot chicks and had him play like horse polo naked and he was like, I'll, I wish you all to play horse club, but just naked. He's an animal.

Speaker 3:          00:58:10       You don't get to be a guy like food unless you've been a part of some shit. You been a part of some shit. That's a manly man. He's a scary dude now. He doesn't give a fuck. You Imagine Putin was mad at you for some shit. How fucking tripping. That would be. How terrifying that would be. You have to go to the other side of the world. Yeah, you gotta you gotta move to the Philippines, come a kickboxer or something. He kind of fuck you better run bitch. You don't want to be hanging around with that guy's mad at, you know, he, he probably, I mean he got to where he was just like straight bully power. I don't know what he did, but he scares the shit out of me. I remember Matt Damon had a really interesting interview where he was talking about Sarah Pailin and a Matt Damon.

Speaker 3:          00:58:55       Damon is very astute, politically, very, very well read guy too, like surprisingly intelligent. You know, you see him in movies, you think he's always a really good actor, but then you hear him talk and you're like, this guy's very bright and very well read. And he had this great analogy about Sarah Pailin being like a Disney movie. And then all of the sudden this woman, you know with her, her Moxie is going to, you know, stand up to the evil Russians, you know? And he was like, you know, I need to, and he was saying like, I need to know, does she really think the earth is less than 10,000 years old? I really, I need to know this. I was like, fuck yeah, yeah man. Yeah, you do need to know. We all need to know that

Speaker 4:          00:59:33       that changes some decisions 20,000 years ago. Nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:59:38       There's a lot of people that still think that that's the new earth. I D I mean we're talking about millions of people. I know there's a lot of people that you might be tens of millions that believe that

Speaker 4:          00:59:49       when do you start believing that I wasn't her? Like does it change your decision making on everything?

Speaker 3:          00:59:56       Yeah. Yeah. There's so god it up. It's just such a, it's such an extreme like belief to, to be that God it up. It's one thing to have an idea that, you know, there's some sort of feels like there's a forest to controls the universe. Maybe there's a gold were all attending to, maybe there's, maybe there's a, uh, a next wave of understanding after this is over and just like a psychedelic experience. It'll all make sense. Maybe. Maybe, maybe, maybe, but, but your idea is crazy. Your idea about a fucking dude in the cloud and, and he died and he came back from the dead and what the fuck are you saying, man? Have you seen the, the creation museum out here and uh, and in Pomona? No, I did not know it was, there was one in Pomona. I was going to go to the one that's on the other side of the country. Yeah, like Kentucky. Yes. It's supposed to be amazing, dude.

Speaker 4:          01:00:48       There's one out here. It's not as good as the one over there, but it's like, it's pretty decent size. You gotta write this down. It's there for a decent sized, and it's like a, it's like Jesus riding dinosaur.

Speaker 3:          01:00:58       Oh No. It does not have Jesus. Right. Jesus riding a dinosaur, like a whole sculpture. It's like Jesus Riding, uh, you know, a raptor and it's in Pomona.

Speaker 4:          01:01:09       Yeah. It's like, it's like Audis here. I think it's been promoted. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       How many people are going to see that? Like as a goof? Is it most,

Speaker 4:          01:01:17       you know, when I was there, it did not seem like I was like, me and a couple people were there as a goof and then it seemed like everybody else was like, Kinda into it and it was like, they were like, ah, you know, it was like a nonprofit organization just about like Jesus riding dinosaurs and shit. It was weird. It was a four year. Wow. That's so crazy, man. Yeah, it was people who were into it, man, they were like, fuck yeah. Jesus rode that

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       Jesus rode dinosaurs. How dare you.

Speaker 4:          01:01:46       Yeah, I liked it. They were like, because at first before there was dinosaur bones, they were just like, you know, no pro labor, like Jesus lives, blah, blah, blah. Then the dinosaur bones came and they needed to come up with an answer, so I liked that they went with like, yeah, Jesus just like wrote them so I would have gone with something else, like maybe Jesus was scared of him, kept him over in a pan or something.

Speaker 3:          01:02:06       Then the whole young earth theory so spooky. It's, it just, it's so weird that you can get people to believe something like that. It's so weird that no matter how many scientists who have these elaborate descriptions of how the earth cooled over billions of and matter changed and the atmosphere changed and different forms of life and there were mass extinctions and here's the fossil record. No, not buying it. No Horse Shit, bad science. I have a book written by people who swear that the world is flat and the sun is 17 miles away. I'm going to let that one influenced me.

Speaker 2:          01:02:42       I think it all stems from just people being freaked out about dying.

Speaker 3:          01:02:47       Oh yeah. For sure. That's a big part of it, man. It's, you need something, you know, look, I have a four year old daughter who's just started to ask questions like, what happens when you die? You know, and that's what they, they start thinking and it's a scary idea for a little kid and it's, you know, the idea of a heaven and God is a very comforting one for, for people. It's almost like, even if it doesn't exist, it's a very useful tool because it actually does provide people with a feeling of relief, you know, if you can, it's like, it's almost like if you can suspend disbelief for a movie, you could suspend the little pudge, Jesus, and just kind of go along with it and it'll provide you with like a framework where you can, you know, you can make sense of life.

Speaker 3:          01:03:31       It'll carry you to whatever the fuck it is when it ends. So what are you, what do you tell her that it's a very interesting conversation. Um, I, I tell her that no one knows what happens when we die and that some people believe that you go to heaven. And then we discussed what would heaven B and then I said, you know, no one really knows what happens but people hope that you go somewhere and everything is beautiful and perfect. So my wife has explained this, that there, and as, as she becomes more and more frantic about who's going to die, it becomes more and more ridiculous. Why keep not having you get whatever you want. Yeah. TV You can watch. It starts off as like a rational sort of conversation and then I realized, what am I doing? She's for like, this is like a fucking serious concept to try to digest for four year old. And I'm like, let's go over the potentials for what happened would be, that seems like a better way.

Speaker 2:          01:04:30       Direction. It just said she become a star and then like, you know when you're 13 just go, hey, you know that star Shit. You're not, you gotta wait til they're 13 and by then she'll be pregnant. Brian. Okay. You gotta talk to them before they're 30 Brian's like till like, it's like having a plan. You just water it when it's young and then leave it in the sun for a while and 13 he can't tell a 13 year old. That's fucking crazy shit that I told you it wasn't real. There's no answer. There's no answer. So just say it's a star and let her believe that and they shall become a hippie. That's funny. My Dad, I remember my dad when I asked him that, my dad said I was just a little kid and he was like, ah, it's just darkness

Speaker 3:          01:05:10       forever. Whoa.

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       Yeah. And I was like, whoa. That's what my mom told me. I was like traumatized by it. And I went to, and I remember going into my mom's room and being like, do dads just statute said and it was dark. Right? And she's like, he doesn't know. And she's like, Sam coming in here and tell me it doesn't, you don't know. Nobody knows. He's like, I know that's what it is. It's darkness forever. And then you have the role play. That's hilarious. Yeah. I think my mom said, you just go to sleep and you just don't wake

Speaker 3:          01:05:41       go. My stepfather told me probably nothing. So you probably, you know, he was the one when I was seven years old, when I started asking these questions, I was really religious until my parents got divorced. And uh, I went to Catholic school for a year and Catholics code is wrong. The religion out of me, I had no, I was like, this is crazy. Total 100% horse shit. And then, um, uh, uh, a year later we had the conversation like, what? Well, if that's not real, if this Jesus Moses Shit is something somebody made up, then what happens when you die? And he was like, oh, it's probably nothing. Probably just sentence, dude. I can't remember crying that hard when I was like a little kid, you know, just lying in my bed.

Speaker 2:          01:06:27       Ooh. Just the terrifying notion that somehow, and none of this was going to end and they would just stomp. Yeah. It's so weird. The same with me. I was like, I would get like panic attacks thinking about it. I'd just be like, what do you mean forever? Yeah. What the fuck is forever in the darkness? I know. What the fuck does that mean? It's weird that everybody loves going asleep. You know people love going to sleep because you know you get to wake up, you know, so you're willing to like stop for a while cause you know you'll come back but nobody wants to die. Not that. My buddies, my buddies, a paramedic and he told me that he had this call the other day and it's like 95 year old dude who was like riddled with cancer hat instead of having a do not resuscitate. He was, it was like full, it was like bring me back full code. Like anything that happens pretty man. I'm like dude that bummed me out so much. Cause I'm like, if a 95 year old dude who's like riddled with cancer isn't ready to die, like I want to be so fucking freaked out at all. The bad guy's like, Nah, I don't want to go. Some people are afraid of everything, you know. But death is something that everybody's afraid of them.

Speaker 3:          01:07:34       And if you're not, it's probably life is miserable for you to the point where death is favorable. Yeah, he must be sick. Something's wrong. There's an imbalance, whether it's a behavioral and bounce or a societal and balance, whether you know, somebody did you wrong to the point where you, it broke your brain. I don't know what the fuck it is, but if you really want to end it for yourself and that's it, it's a

Speaker 2:          01:07:55       terrible place to be than that and that like, like I'm not really afraid to die like I, because I have Jesus in my heart and all that. No, but I mean, no, I'm not. I'm not. I think that it's because of mushrooms. I've had so many where I thought I was dying and I, I was like, you know what? This is, this has been good and blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, oh wait, I die. Oh

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       yeah. It would be awesome if there was something that you could believe so wholeheartedly that it calmed you down and you're like, well, I'm not worried about it. If it ends, we're fine. We just go to this. Just like, you're not worried about going to sleep, you're not worried we're going to go on asleep cause you know you're gonna wake up. I know where I'm never worried about going to sleep. I'm like, Oh let me go to sleep problem. It's great. I wake up beautiful. If, if we had the information that we have about coming back like we have about sleep, you know, maybe it's just

Speaker 2:          01:08:46       then people saw the things you think. So I think if people knew like once you died it was like fucking shaking an acid, etch a sketch.

Speaker 6:          01:08:54       People would do really fucked out things. I would hope not. I would hope the opposite. I would hope if they, if that first of all would freak people out just to know that you definitely would come back. That would just be such a trip. It'd be so scared to try again. Yeah, that's true. And also like what if you came back and they fucking terrible situation. What if you were like a spoiled Twat? You know, living on long island, it's just balling out of control in a mansion and then you come back in. You're in new Uganda. Yeah. You're in the jungle and you're gonna. You have aids. You have a big bloated belly like that could be you too. You got just some crazy lucky role. The DNA dice that you're here in America in 2012 just that alone. You want to try this again? You get a, you're going to play fair. You're going to take any spot all over the globe. Like what do you come back [inaudible] come back as you are you doing? You are on the same trip every time trying to get it right. Is that it?

Speaker 2:          01:09:53       Yeah. Like if we're going odds, you're like in some fucking tiny town in China.

Speaker 6:          01:09:57       It's like drinking water, drinking water from like no puddles. Yeah. Warm Brown puddles of water that people step in. That's where you're getting your water. Fuck man. Yeah. There's a lot of spots on the earth that are just shit. Roll the dice to be there, man. Big Time. We're lucky. Southern California. So lucky. It's delusional. It's good. I could live. Weather here is so incredible all the time that no one ever has to deal with nature. There's no storms to stay indoors from, you know, this snow shoveling of the streets, you know, getting the snow out or

Speaker 2:          01:10:32       no, just a giant astronauts asteroid of a, an earthquake that's coming towards that we all know is going to happen. They're going to die. Well, I mean, like, we know that there's a ticking time bomb. I, it could make a big deal because I grew up in San Diego and you don't give a fuck about anything when you grow up in like, the weather's perfect and like, yeah, you get an earthquake every now and then, but like a little bit of shaking. I like every two years. Look at Japan. Just look at the recent tragedies lately that just destroyed. I mean, Tokyo is pretty much gone like that, that I don't know if they would ever recover. They, they, that country as a whole is pretty much fucked and they don't want to talk about it, but it's pretty much these gone, right?

Speaker 6:          01:11:12       Um, I don't eat mean

Speaker 3:          01:11:13       economically. The Fukushima areas. Fuck yeah. The, the area where the meltdown happened, right. They're already seeing mutated animals. Shit. Bonnie's born with no arms or ears or weird shit is going on at red and going just going to San Diego. You go by that naked gun, huge tit reactor and he just like look around there and like, oh shit. You know, it just takes one earthquake and that shit's fucked. Yeah. Didn't you think about that when you went by? Absolutely. Holy thought about that as we went by it. I was doing by it. I looked at that thing. I'm like, what a nutty place to put this right next to the ocean. You fucking crazy insulin assholes. And you know why they put it right next to the ocean. Shit goes wrong. They can flood it with ocean water to cool it off and and awesome and that water goes right back in the ocean.

Speaker 3:          01:11:55       Yeah. That's what they did in Japan. They fucking poured millions of gallons of ocean water on the, the actual inferno of hell and then they pour that water right back in the ocean. It's unbelievably toxic. I mean, it's fucking going to jack everything and they're like, it's too what we gotta do. We gotta do we gotta do it? Tough Shit. So everything gets checked on it there that you need millions of gallons that, oh, she's a son, they made a son. He'll be fine. It's a little baby son. I mean, and do you know what nuclear power is? Did you know that it's just steam. They just did the nuclear heat, you know that melts water, make steam and that powers all these reactors. That's what that's like the, that's that's the mechanism behind it. Producing electricity. No idea about any of that. I have no idea either. I just figured it was somehow or another they take that nuclear energy and they put it on a wire and it goes to in your hairdryer?

Speaker 3:          01:12:46       No, it's like it's the same sort of idea. You know the force behind it. I think in the steam behind it is what, what powers the generators. But it's essentially, it's a nuclear reaction that they can't ever cool off. You can't like can't shut it off. Stupidest idea every if, if the fucking thing meant meltdown, you're done. You just have to get away from it. You can't cool it off. It does. That's like, that's so nuts. Like I, we can have wind power where we have the windmill spinning or we can have this fucking thing that's impossible. The cool this son that if it'd be, apparently they had a backup plan up to like a certain amount of, you know, earthquake and this far exceeded that. This was like a really ridiculously powerful earthquake and they lost their backup generator and so they knew they had like eight hours.

Speaker 3:          01:13:34       We've got eight hours to get the fuck outta here. He can't fix it. Like what are you talking about? How arrogant are human beings that they would make something where that could even possibly ever happen and not have any way you would say, okay, before we build it, do you guys really know how to shut this off? Is there, okay. And what happens if that happens and what happens to the power doesn't come back on then what happens? Oh, then, oh, then it just eats through the earth. We don't know when it stops, it goes through the core and it just keeps going and probably comes out of the other side or something. The fuck they don't know. It's never happened before that and they went, okay, we'll build it. We'll say sounds good. Crazy. Sounds good. Go build that. How many guys want to build?

Speaker 3:          01:14:19       You want to be like a few hundred of them? Just leave them around. Yeah, let's put them near fault lines and shit. So let's add some earthquakes to la. Let's add some earthquakes to all this fucking people that we have here that's added to the nuclear shit. That's attitude. The fact that we don't have any water as less handling. We don't have any elect our electricity. He's fucking gone, dude. We live in the dumbest place in the whole entire roof. No, Vegas is the dumbest. This is the second. Second Dennis. Well at least Vegas. I did a Fresno. Fresno fuck. It sucks. Yeah man. I've seen some spots. It's suck a lot worse than Pasadena. Yeah, well it's tricky, that's for sure. We're, we're certainly susceptible. And the more they find out, like, you know, the archeologists are constantly uncovering these lost cities now. Like they've found a few of them off the coast of Spain and one of them they think might be Atlantis and they found one recently that was like, it was underwater as recently as 8,500 years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:15:13       So this is like crazy old stuff, you know, and it's, you know, old pottery and it's old, different fucking we're finding out that like shit happens and goes wrong all the time on this planet. You know, it's always getting hit by rocks from outer space and there's fucking volcanoes. The blow up every now and again and the earth moves and giant thousand foot high tsunamis wipe out miles in and then pull back. And that shit happens all the time in history. You know, we just, for whatever reason, are willing to gamble that it's not gonna it's not gonna happen on my watch. No. I mean basically that's what it is. Cause it's eventually going to happen. Yeah. I mean it's an avoidable d we, you know, we've harped on it too many times probably by now, but the just the asteroid number alone, when they find out how many hundreds of thousands of asteroids are hovering around inside of our solar system and you're like, what the fuck are you talking about?

Speaker 3:          01:16:06       It's not like, oh, I heard there's like a hundred asteroids. No, there's like thousands of thousands and thousands of these fucking things just flying around and one of them could just call her Ghrelin towards us. We've been hit before many times and most likely that's responsible for the, a bunch of different weird shit where they finally these ancient civilizations and they don't understand how they were sophisticated back then. It's by we've stacked up some progress and been knocked down a few times. The very date of, Oh, I think it's like they're like a 12,500 years ago or something. Right now scientists are a growth is a bunch of people over the country or over the world rather that are agreeing that there was some sort of an impact that happened then because they're doing all their core samples, they find some sort of a glass that's only created in like nuclear blasts or extreme impacts or you know, things along those lines like tongue goose got like that kind of shit has to happen.

Speaker 3:          01:17:03       Like some crazy impact and they're finding a lot of this shit at 12,500 years. So they think it's really possible that we had like a massive meteor shower 12,500 years ago. It might have fucked up, you know, 50% of the cities of the world, you know, but back then think about 12,500 years ago and didn't know how, how does that information get to us if you, if every half the city's did get jacked by these giant rock from space, who, how many people would remember that story? What would that story be? By the time they figured out how to make paper again. You know, I got to feel like if you were alive for that, you got to remember that. It's like, yeah, you remember the one time we got hit with it? Yeah, I remember. I remember that. What do you think they, the people that survived even knew what the fuck happened.

Speaker 3:          01:17:51       Cause maybe it was just like dumb luck. You know, like they probably a bunch of asteroids came down, a meteor shower just fucked up. Boom, boom, boom. Like maybe, maybe some places like it just didn't hit them. And so those are the ones that survive. Then they had to go and look at the rest of the world. That would be equally freaky to know that it could happen to you any day. Do you get, if you lived in a place where you didn't get hit, but you heard all these crazy noises in the background, but you and your tribe, you guys are fucking cool, no problems whatsoever. And then you venture forth and it's like Lord of the rings everywhere. You look as burnt out and smoking and like what the fuck? Everyone's dead. Everywhere you go is just bodies. Just pieces of hands and feet and fucking heads.

Speaker 3:          01:18:36       Cause everybody got hit with giant rocks from the sky and pulverized into but just she would groups of people smashed on the highway with big rocks. Boom. That would be almost freakier than dying to know that disk just happened a few hundred miles from you and you, you know, you get on your horse and find it and you see how nutty it is. You see how none of the damages and know that that could happen at the sky can just all of a sudden be just a swarm of fiery rocks. Yes. Especially like before science or any, anything to explain anything or God, I feel like everything people saw back then, they were like, what the fuck is this? You Imagine? I mean, how weird is it that w when did we become so, so conscious? Like when did we become so aware of all the possibilities in our environment?

Speaker 3:          01:19:24       I mean it was a slow, gradual process where the human brain evolved, right? It's not like we were always this smart right from the get go. Somewhere along the line it must have been, I mean that's probably what religion is really all about. It's probably like some sort of psychic training wheels, you know, it's like you're not quite ready to grasp the polled. None of us are. So it's like let's give you an ideology to believe in that puts you on the right track. Cause you know this, this feeling of God and love and everything that it's totally the right way to do it. It's totally the right way to live. So how, how do you need to get there? Do you need to get there through yoga? Well then you go yoga, you go yoga and find that spot. Could is the baby Jesus more you're liking? Yeah, like singing. I'm really good with groups. Okay, go that way. He just, you know, it's like the psychic training wheels. As we get through this, this weird spot, get through this weird spot, we start to awaken and see how fucking crazy this world is and realize sometimes the sky becomes of a light with flying rocks that are on fire. Fuck. It's like nobody's going to stop that man. If, if all of a sudden we got caught a meteor shower, that's, well, that's just what it is.

Speaker 4:          01:20:38       Yeah. Well, yeah. Imagine you're there and you see the flying rocks flying. First thing you'd be after you run for your life, then you're like, well obviously somebody threw that at me. That's gigantic. Freshly back bends. Yeah. That's how he back then. Oh, we're being attacked by God's Haiti's cause I'm Braga, you know, like you throw your a caveman or whatever you throw shit, throw rocks is under. If that was like where the origins of of Haiti's [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:21:05       hell fire and all that shit came from, I wonder if that was that, you know, you've gotta wonder like when, when did they first figure out the idea of hell? Was it when they first saw volcano? It makes sense. Yeah. If you for, if you were fucking capers and you show a volcano, hell totally makes sense. You're like, you do not want to go there. You will fucking burn forever. I mean, it looks like, yeah, you would burn forever if you could exist and somehow or another not disappear instantly into the lava and just have that feeling of being burned by lava forever. Probably the most terrifying thing a person could ever experience.

Speaker 4:          01:21:40       Well, definitely. Imagine you don't know it's 10,000 years ago. You don't know anything about science. You see a volcano erupt and then some shit comes out of it that's just disintegrates everything in its path. You're like, yeah, that's probably the bad place. Mark W,

Speaker 3:          01:21:54       well, most people don't realize is the Yellowstone volcano. This is one of the biggest volcanoes in the earth. It's a, it's a super volcano. Yellowstone is something called a Caldera volcano, and they didn't even discover this until I think like a decade ago. I think when they started using satellites to map things out, they realize that it's a crater and that Yellowstone, I think it's like 300 kilometers wide or something crazy like that might be 600 kilometer. That'd be 300 miles. Yes. Not only is it active, it's a super volcano, which means it gets up to a peak and then the peak explodes. The whole thing explodes and just leaves behind a whole team. Yeah, it kills like a giant percentage of everything in the continent because it's such a huge volcano. I mean it like, it becomes like almost like a nuclear winter type situation. I think it fills the sky with ash. I mean, I think it's, it's such a massive volcano that you really could call it a continent killer and it happens every six to 800,000 years and the last time it happened was 600,000 years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:22:57       Yeah. So if that did happen and there's not a goddamn thing we can do to stop it. If Yellowstone decided to blow and it went called dare on us and fucking erupted on us. That's a wrap for black. Most of the west coast, a huge chunk of the country. I mean is, it's done, dude. It's a fucking horror movie. It's the road. It's that movie Viggo Mortensen it's that shit. It's that shit. That's the only time it's okay to say you would fuck Obama. Yes. Then you can get away with anything, then you can get away with anything. And Don might have happened in a let, to a lesser extent to our ancestors. It's very possible that might have happened. That might be with, you know, when they find all these crazy structures and shit under the ocean, that might be what happened is people might've got jack. Yeah. You gotta imagine. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:23:42       Because it's also like, you know, if that should happen, like seems like crazy shit happens every like 50,000 years. Like it's got to happen. Like you said, we've, we've probably gone farther in technology then, you know, two steps forward. One step back. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:23:56       Yeah. I agree. Yeah. You know, except for when you look at, uh, uh, buildings, you know, some of the crazy Egyptian buildings and shit. Like, how the fuck did they do that? You know, if there really was an ancient civilization and figured out how to do that, like, well, they, they might've been ahead of us, you know, I dunno. I mean, that seems like in a lot of ways it seems ahead of us. The construction methods that the giant stones they moved like, but it's pretty clear that everybody gets nailed, you know, it's just no way you can avoid it. The little things like, you know, the, the tsunami that killed everyone and Thailand, you know, that was t to us, it was a huge deal. You know, to us humans think about the numbers in the body counts, but to the world population, it's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing. It's, it's weird how many different things like that could happen in mass scale, like frightening scale thousand mile, you know, fucking, uh, I think it's 45,000 mile an hour. Asteroids. That's, that's like what the speed that most of them are travel that, you know. And there could be a mile wide, five miles wide.

Speaker 4:          01:25:00       It's like, it's crazy thing too. Like even if you look at like the plague as reading this, I was reading something, it's like it killed three fifths of the people in Europe. Like what if that happened now? Nice. Like people would go, but like Thailand, you know we go bananas at the Thailand thing. It's such a small percentage. Like three out of five people in Europe. Every three out of five people die. Well what, what happened was it was the plague. Something that was transmitted by rodents. Yeah. Cause the fleas carried all of the plague and then the rodents would get on the boats. They'd run a clock across the ropes that get to the shore and then the fleets would come out and bite people. Oh Jesus Christ. Get everybody. Then they end up at Applebee's. Fucking

Speaker 3:          01:25:41       Gary is the plague. Did you know that a guy in um, uh, where the fuck was it that he got tested? A guy got bitten by an animal and he got tested for the play. I think it was a cat and he tested positive for the plague. It was like it was in the Pacific northwest. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:25:58       I want to say cause that there's been a couple cases of the plague like in California. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       Fuck. You know that's like some old school pirate shit. You hear the plague? Yeah. Yeah. It's connected to boats, right? Like what the fuck man, the plague really must've sucked. Fat Dick live in Baghdad for he fits to the people die from the plague. Everybody's like stinky all the time. Time. Yeah. A lot of rape going on. Probably tons and probably people are assholes who just dying and when people died easier and quicker, they were probably like way more conti. Right. They didn't last that long. They just fucking got all their content and they probably were much more likely to commit violence on each other. They are probably much closer to animals. Oh yeah. How far back do you think you can go and still rocket seventies think you'd be happy in the 70s yeah, that'd be having this, that can be happy. In the 70s I would miss my phone now Matt.

Speaker 6:          01:26:57       A lot. I'd miss being able to call people and we, it never made this interview, man. I never spoke a word to you until we walked in the door and said, hey, what's up? You know, it was all done through, you know, texts and emails and all that jazz. It's kind of fascinating that it couldn't have happened in the 70s even just like, yeah. Have you ever like tried to go pick somebody up at the airport and forgot your phone? Yeah. It's like you might as well just turn around and go, oh yeah. Oh, it's so weird what we accept. It's so weird. I could probably do the 60s but no earlier sixties or interesting. You get some cool cars. You could, you could be driving around in a brand new 1964 Mustang. Holy Shit. And it would be real. You know, like this is a fucking real brand new 64 Mustang.

Speaker 6:          01:27:45       You feel what it was like to have one of those things back then. That might be fun. That might be fine. You would know so much more than them. It would be stealing. You could be able to fuck every chicken meat. All you have to do is keep talking to him, keep talking to him long enough. They'd be like, he's a prophet ahead. I have to go with him. He has the answers that I seek. You could totally start a call to be like, Fuck Charlie Manson. Charlie, sit the fuck down. I'm gonna tell you some shit about the future. This is what's going to happen. There's going to be pills that you can take and you'll be happy even if your life is shit. That would be, I like that. That's the first knowledge you drop on them. That's the first thing he tell him. Tell him you will one day be ruled by pills to control your emotions and then they can lock you in a cage if you say the wrong words.

Speaker 6:          01:28:31       Oh no dude, I would buy into that cold if I was in the 60s yeah, the 60s would be an interesting time to go back to with all the knowledge of today would have the knowledge like imagine if you knew like political shit. Today's the day they killed Kennedy. Cause you imagine how much you want to bet. How much am I bet they kill Kennedy today. You're just as bad as you. Don't try to stop it. Stop it. He does. He just go to Vegas. You go can, I bet they fucking killed the president. You want to bet pitch and they'll, they'll, they'll take your money. Vegas, we'll take your money. But then that's back sixties Vegas where it's all gangsters and shit. Yeah, they kill you for being right. They're like, listen, we know when Kennedy is going to die. We're going to be a part of how stupid. Fuck we're going to, we're going to make the driver go really slow in Dallas.

Speaker 6:          01:29:18       Yeah they did. That's different. You don't want to be part of that part of the 60s that would suck now. Definitely they killed people back then. They had problems with them like JFK, RFK and they just sat and ate them. Sneak up behind them in front of a bunch of people. That's the crazy shit like RFK was. He was, he was running for president who send me just like walked up to him with a gun and shot of, yeah, dude, I was at the place where they did it. We, uh, we filmed some fear factors there. Oh really? Where is that? At? Some hotel in downtown. I think they're, they might be tearing it down. I think bill burr was really upset about it. Wait, that's here in la. Bill Burr was really upset about it. It was, and he's so right. He's so dead on as always.

Speaker 6:          01:30:03       But he was like, ah. He goes, no one he has any, any idea history, you know, if that was back east, you couldn't fucking tear that down and put a fucking parking lot there. He goes, no, it'd be like it. There'll be a plaque there so you could know that this is where the shit went down. It's so true. But in la they were like, yeah, Robert Kennedy was killed here, or whatever. It's, this is, it's a strip club now, but now it's like, yeah, the downtown is that, she said weird here. Your place. Have you been a skid row yet? I have, Whoa, her legs like first, like one of my first weeks up here, I was trying to go to a Laker game and I and I made a wrong turn and all of a sudden they was like fucking 28 days later. Like it's just like so packed with it was, I've never seen just the concentration of the sale.

Speaker 6:          01:30:50       You can't believe it unless you say it. It's, it's really, it's true. Can't believe unless you say it's, it's, it's staggering. You. You think we're exaggerating. You're saying there's no way anybody would it, they've become a tribe. It's a tribe of homeless people and there's maybe thousands of them. So I saw something else. I said, no, no, no. I saw something and said there was 100,000 homeless people living in downtown Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. You know. Crazy. That sounds, that's like an arm 100. That's what I'm talking about, man. Skid row is weird. We filmed some fear factor stuff, a lot of it in downtown La on buildings. We do like things when people out across buildings and shit like that. And, um, we were always like right around the corner and sometimes we had to like do shit. Like that was like right there in the thick of things and so you would go around the corner and like when you leave work, if you went around the corner and took a left and then took another left, you're in a Zombie movie. You really are like, you fucked up. You're, you're on the wrong street and people are asking you for money and they're touching your car and you're like, what is going on? I didn't see any of that in San Diego by the way.

Speaker 6:          01:31:58       And Sue's good. And also the marijuana shit was so much stricter. Yeah. He was like, like even the body guards or the bouncers of every club, we're all ex military or something. Like I said, they were like, Oh, you smoke a bong, you better not be smoke weed. Yeah, they gotta relax. They got to relax on that. Every, that it's good. It's, there's, there's good and bad in military presence. It'd be more good than bad if they let them smoke weed soldiers who smoked. We would be like the best soldiers to have the bill like lesson. Everything's going to work out. We're going to, we obviously fucked up. We're going to slowly back up. By the way, we have a show tonight. If you're listening to this live right now, there's still tickets available so you can still get down here at the ice house.

Speaker 6:          01:32:42       It's a super show. Like we always do these, um, whoever's in town and we got Ari Shaffir, Doug Benson, dom, I rarer dove, Dove David off Jesus fucking Christ. If you've never seen dove, he's very, very funny. He's fucking hilarious. Very unique too. He's um, he's like one of my favorite guys. Watch and dom [inaudible] one of my all time favorites. Course Tivo, Jayson, t bell, Brian red bands going to go up and do my favorite joke. We do my favorite, which Joe, you know the joke came and talk about it cause I don't want anybody to know the joke. That joke. Yeah, yeah. That one. Yeah. I have a new one that I'm in love with and do that too. But I got to hear that other joke. That's, I love that joke. And a, that'd be tonight if it's 15 bucks at the Ice House, 10 o'clock show and uh, and I have a, I'm doing like half hour, 40 minutes, something like that at the end.

Speaker 6:          01:33:31       Who would they not get drunk and I might go long. Who are the comedians that you like would pay to see now? Like the ones your favorites? Ah, I paid to see anybody. Good man. I love comedy. I mean I don't have to pay really, really. Cause I, you know, most guys are going to like ask them and they'll let me come into their show. But I'd still love to go see comedy. Like we just saw dice clay at the Riviera and Vegas. I fucking loved it, man. Me and Brian, we were like little kids. We w how fun was that show? Oh, it was great. So much fun. Exactly what I wanted. Yeah, it was, we all were, uh, were hanging out and um, we were in Vegas for the UFC and it was Friday night and I was free. We didn't have anything to do.

Speaker 6:          01:34:07       And a opie and Anthony, you know, you know those guys. You ever done a show? Jimmy Norton and Anthony Kumiai, we're in town and there, um, one of the guys that works on show, Sam Roberts, he was in town too. And so we all went out to dinner together. So while we're out at dinner we'd go, let's go see dices show. So we text, dice, dice, text back. We'd go there and it was like, like we were like little kids were like, we get to go see a show. Like I got to go see dice at the Riviera. I was so happy. Like I fucking love to go see like a good show. I didn't have to pay for it cause dice hooked me up, but I would be happy to pay to see that. That was really fun. You know? I mean when I was a first start now, before it was successful, it was really hard for me to go see too many comedians because I would like, I'd feel like like God, I Suck and listen to that guy. I don't even want to even want to go on stage now and, and

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       then I would be like weirded out by other people's acts. Like I didn't want to watch people do better than me, I didn't want. But then once you get to a certain little level of comfort, you realize why he became a comedian in the first place. It's because you love watching stuff and laughing at it and so then you get to figure it out again and then be a fan again. So me, it was like the first 10 years of my comedy life, it was like a cycle of like slowly figuring out that you just have to like enjoy it, like and just laugh at everything and it don't just because you're a struggling comedian don't not enjoy comedy because comedy is like the best form of entertainment. That's why you like it in the first place. Right. You know, don't not like it because you suck at it.

Speaker 5:          01:35:38       By the way, Joe, I don't know if you know about this yet or, or, or not, but, uh, Steve, uh, car leasing from OPA and Anthony [inaudible] happen. Uh, you know, I don't know. I got to, I got an email today from Iraq. Uh, and uh, but there, there's a memorial fund for his family. I'm, here's a, I remember last time I talked to him. Oh yeah, yeah. Is the, uh, the address I tweeted if you want to, if you want to Twitter, Twitter it, uh, but tell people that are listening to this on their phone where they could find it. Um, yeah, it is. Let's see. Well, the addresses go fund me.com/v h zero EDW, which makes no sense, but if you go to my Twitter, uh, it's red bin or go to Joe Rogan's Twitter where I'm sure he's gonna tweet it,

Speaker 1:          01:36:25       right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'm going to retweet it right here. When it says on, um, on Brian's is, I'm very sad about this. Steve was a great guy and today's date is, is what

Speaker 5:          01:36:34       is it? The 18th. So if you'd go to Brian's Twitter feed on the 18th and fans of Opie and Anthony know him, he was a really nice guy. He, I remember he had a really cool tattoos and he's a really cool guy. I the socks, I don't know what happens. Terrible News. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, I saw Sam's email. He sent me an email as well and uh, he gave us a URL, I believe, didn't he? Uh, yeah, that's the one I just twittered okay, but can he give it out to people? I just didn't know what I just did it, it makes no sense. It's like back slash and all bunch of numbers and words. So it's one of those, okay, well, it's on my Twitter. I retweeted it. It's on Brian's and we're very sorry to hear that. He was a great guy and hopefully he's in heaven.

Speaker 5:          01:37:16       Yeah. Or darkness. Darkness. Like your dad would say that's, that's fucking disturbing. Heaven's better having Sue's it better. That sucks man. I hate hearing shit like that. How old is he? Oh, I don't think he was very old at all. I don't even think it was 40 was he? No, he was in English. I think it was in the early days. Yeah. That he lost a ton of weight, right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. But that was a while ago. But yeah, but it looks like they've almost reached their goal, so that's great. Um, they're, they're trying to raise 30,000 so I have so many openings for the fans. I guess. That's good. Come through. That's awesome. Thanks

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       everybody. And thank you Brian for bringing,

Speaker 5:          01:37:58       that's frigging the show down to screeching halt. It is a, that is a bummer though, man. So I, I have some, an update of a past episode wherein I smoked moth poop and a little bit of orange fluorescent orange stuff came out of it. I found out that it was actually shit. So like I didn't know for sure. She didn't know if it was eggs or styling something use. He smoked it. This is the problem. The kid did ecstasy two days ago and he hasn't been the same sentence.

Speaker 1:          01:38:25       I don't know whether I should call us mom. I'm thinking I need to call his mom and say, Mrs Red Ban. We got a situation here. Yeah, it's show. Yeah, Brian's friend. Yeah. He's um, it's just, uh, I don't, I think, I think you fucked up. I think he smoked too much. Mark. Thank you. Went over the other side. I don't know what, I didn't tie his ankle and I don't know if we're ever going to get them back.

Speaker 5:          01:38:50       Dude, I did ecstasy once and I couldn't read the next day. I can't believe you do it so often. I don't do it often. I do it every three months. Maybe that's a lot months. It's for me. That's terrifying. Oh, and I don't do x. Do they do, do Molly, which is better. Better wait about it. Huh?

Speaker 1:          01:39:05       Okay. I have a bad, I had a great experience and a bad experience, a great experience, and it felt really good, bad experiences. The next day I was useless. I was dried out. It's like, I felt like I would literally had been dried out like my brain, like a sponge that was out in the sun. That seems like that's the worst part for me. It was. I mean I think everybody's different in how I have bad sleep apnea too. So I think I'm always a little bit depleted, you know, when it comes to a shit like that. If I, back then I wasn't on top of it. I didn't know now where like this mouthpiece that keeps me, I have a big tongue and have fun. No, you don't need to know all this shit about me, dude. Okay. My point was, um, maybe uh, maybe that hindered me from coming back as good cause I wasn't getting very good sleep, but it was hard for me to bounce back mentally. I don't think I was the same for several days. The next day I remember feeling really, really stupid, like think and I went on stage and try to remember my act, but it was, it was not good. It was just a really mediocre show. It wasn't a good show. I remember for like three or four days thinking this is a fucking terrible idea. I learned so much about myself, but I was like, I'm never doing this again. Fuck

Speaker 4:          01:40:16       yeah. I one time I went college, my neighbors, uh, they used to sell weed, coke and everything like that and I played baseball in college and uh, so I could never eat, couldn't do any drag, sees you got drug tested all the time. And then uh, I had this fucked up injury again, I'm telling you too much information. But anyway, they gave me this shit to smoke cause I wasn't getting drug tests anymore and I didn't know, but they had just like, I guess they had sprinkled coke and something else on it. Whoa. Yeah. And I didn't know, I just thought I was smoking weed and so I smoked it and I was just like going out of my fucking mind. Like I knew it wasn't. We'd like 10 minutes into it, I was like, my heart was beating super fast and I was getting, I was sweaty on just one half of my face and

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       the other half was like, it's perfectly dry. The other, I was just like dripping sweat and for the next two days I thought I was retarded. Like I couldn't, I couldn't think through thoughts. Like it was freaking me out. I've never done coke, but the whole coke culture of getting really high and then crashing through the fucking bottom is so unappealing to me. I don't understand. It scares the shit out of me. Yeah. No, that's why I like, cause I like being kinda up. So that's why I, same thing, I've never done coke because I know I'll do it and then I'll really like it. And every, everybody, I, every time I'm with somebody who, who does coke, they're always just like looking for more coke. Oh yeah. Like you have to sit and enjoy it. I liked it that much. I liked it for a month, but after a while that, that feeling of always looking for it.

Speaker 5:          01:41:41       I, at least for me, I was like, yeah, this sucks. Why do I want to keep on doing something that I want to keep on looking for? And I keep on spinning like $100 every couple hours. Yeah. You're an interesting dude, Brian. And that a lot of people don't realize like you go, oh, you know, Brian doesn't have a, it doesn't have a lot of willpower. You actually do. You have a lot of willpower and you lost an insane amount of weight really quickly. You lost like 70 or 80 pounds. Right? How many pounds did you lose? I don't remember. I think it was 75 pounds or 70 pounds. And he did it over a really short period of time, four months. And it was really shocking to watch him just shrink. And I was like, what will you, when you put your mind to shit, you can, you can get things done.

Speaker 5:          01:42:22       But most of the time you just decided not to put your mind to think, oh, I put my mind too much. Too much. Now what did you do to lose all that weight so quick? Uh, I just did white weight watchers, but I did half the points at like a hacked weight watchers. I did half the points and, and then I, I just did a lot of zero point things. Like all vegetables. I just ate vegetables nonstop to, I couldn't eat any more vegetables. Did you feel good worked out when you were really light like that? Did you feel good? Yeah. Um, I don't remember if I felt the same as I do now. I didn't feel any better. I don't remember feeling going like, oh, I feel great. No, you were exercising a lot too though, right? Why don't you, uh, I was exercising five, four days a week, five days a week. It's a lot for you. Like how often you do it now? Uh, once, let's see, I've done it twice in the last six months.

Speaker 5:          01:43:16       That was great delivery, man. I walked a lot of comic con he don't really be funny. You should say that on stage. That was funny. That was really good delivery. Yeah, but like somebody just asked me that exact same question today and I was like, you know what? I walked probably a good five miles this last week and that kind of comic con, but I do a lot of that shit where I'm like, oh no, I mean I do exercise, move your body from one place to another without equipment. Right. I Walk to Starbucks, that's what he gets. It is working out, moving his body unassisted. You will be the first amongst us to give in to having one of those fucking,

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       those uh, those freeway things. What are those things? Segues. That's how you're going to get a ride. I want to, I want to go on a segway. That's what does guilty pleasures that I haven't done yet. You know, like, I just want to treat myself to a segway. You never, you really never done one. They're amazing. Pretty cool. They're super cool. It's a gyroscope. The only issue with those things is, um, they, when they were shut off, they would just shut off and people would just fall on their ass and it's, you know, you really get jacked like old people like, you know, fell and got fucked up. I hear the new ones are just fucking bad. Yeah, the new one's let you know. They like beep and shit. They let you know it's dying. Get off me bitch. I'm going to die. I wonder what they did. The guys created them. He drove off a cliff on one. I think the guy who really need it. Yes. He fell off a cliff on one. Yeah. Um, whoops. What? Fuck that man. Imagine watching that happen in the beginning of a Coen brothers movie.

Speaker 6:          01:44:47       The Guy, he's fucking zipping her alarm on the Pacific highway, waving the people hanging in and he looks down at his phone and check his text messages and write as he types l o l to something that's not even remotely fucking funny. Why the new ones are fucking amazing. I'm hungry. Lol. Boom. Off the cliff and you watch him flip. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't tell dunk. And the coyote's moving to check these new models. Start chewing them apart at night. Yeah, they're dope as fuck duty. Kevin James used one for that. Paul Blart Mall cop movie. And then once he use it for that, he decided to bring them with him when he does any movie. Cause it's like the best way to get around. I got on a big satis specially so he, he had a couple of those on I shown me and him. We used to go around the Boston common with them.

Speaker 6:          01:45:45       It was so fun. How fast are those go? Probably like as fast as you can run Max speed 20 miles an hour or 12 miles an hour. Know they, they have um, ones I think that cops use that go faster. I think I'm thinking of those. Yeah, I've seen those ones. Cause what does, what does a person have fast person run? Like what do they worn? Like 30 miles an hour or something like close to like, like you saying bolt, what does he do? He does like close to 30 miles an hour, right? Isn't that funny person who was a car? They wouldn't be shit. Weak ass fucking bitch. 30 miles an hour. Mr. Segway hard. That's annoying. It's annoying when you have to go 30 miles an hour. Yeah. You're like, I can see if you're on the highway and you can only go 30 miles an hour, you'd be like, oh, this is going to take for it.

Speaker 6:          01:46:29       Well that's you running full lip. The fastest human in the hurling, his body against gravity. That's a, anytime people are like, oh, this guy is such an amazing athlete. I'm like, I can, I just saw a fucking bear run like 35 40. And he's like a fat slow bear, big giant ass fucking animal. You see what those things look like when they lose their hair? Oh, you look amazing. It's their hair. Yeah. There's a bear that has uh, some, some form of Maine's probably and uh, there's pictures of it like with no hair. It looks like some creature in like, like a never ending story or something. It doesn't look real. It like a hobbit type picture say is if you can find that it looks, it looks like dark crystal actually. Yeah. Look at that. Oh my God. Come on, man. How strange is that?

Speaker 6:          01:47:17       That's horrible. I had a dog that had mains like that. Not that bad, but giant patches of her body. When I found her, I rescued her giant patches of her body would like that. That's apparently where the Chupa copper, they think the myth comes from too. It was coyotes. They get that age. Coyotes would have mains. They lose all their hair and they look for Riki. They look really fucking creepy. Have you see if you can find one of those coyotes with no hair man. Ooh, what does that, he's got to pick pink shirt on. Ms Paint for us a frosh. How was that still in use? No wait, what was it called again? Where are we talking about coyote with main change? Eh, you know the, the, the images, one of them was on I think one of those like monster quest type shows.

Speaker 6:          01:48:05       They were trying to say like, someone thought they had a Chupa copper, right? Yeah. And that's what it turned out to be. Turned out to be a coyote. That it had the mange or they lose all the hair on their body and they just look really freaky cause it chipped. It has no hair to have you seen that? Yeah. That's one of them, man. Huh? What are you doing? Are you going the other way? It's um, there's a chip that has no hair to that one is really frightening. Yeah. Pull that up. The chimp with no hair is crazy because you really start to think like how terrifying it would be if this thing was trying to bite your dick off. Like wait. It probably would do if it got alone with you. You're actually, it looks like a girl at like an gross grown bar. Yeah. Look at that. That's horrible late. Do you see the full image? His body is enormous to his muscles are fucking huge. Pull that one up right there. Look at that. Click on that. Gee, he's us. Look at the size of his fucking muscles,

Speaker 4:          01:49:00       dude. That's like, yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:49:01       And that's a chimpanzee. These muscles are way stronger than yours. So that, that creepy looking beast has probably, you know, strength of a 500 600 pound man. Maybe even more if he was like a ripped 500, 600 pound that. Yeah, like a superhuman. I mean there, there's so much stronger than us. They think he can hurl his body through the air, grab ahold of things with one arm and slinging his body to their side. Do you ever seen one of those guys get angry in a cage and hurl themselves around?

Speaker 4:          01:49:29       Dude, I, I uh, I live right by the zoo in San Diego. May go all the time. I got a pass.

Speaker 6:          01:49:34       Oh, that a wild animal park. That's awesome. Zoo.

Speaker 4:          01:49:38       And uh, one time I was at the monkey cage and this guy was just like banging on the glass trying to get the monkeys to pay attention to him. Stupid. And the monkey

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       came up like it was, I was like, I don't know what it was. It was like a Bonobo or something like that and it just, it just fucking rock the glass once and put a crack in it. And then like all of a sudden, like all of the fucking, you know, zookeeper, people came in and ship it. Like it was just, it looked like a monkey that looked like a hundred pound monkey and it was so fucking strong that it put a crack in this class. Yeah, it was a chimp. Oh Wow. Cause we shouldn't really say monkey chimp that people get angry. It's racist. They get angry with me is incorrect for apes, monkeys, hotels is, that's what that's I call called monkeys to the chimp. Then this was a chimp. Chimps are super fucking strong and a hundred pound champ could fuck you up.

Speaker 6:          01:50:28       Oh yeah. Fuck you up man. And imagine like those gorillas, that's just like go. That's one of the greatest movie scenes in any movie ever was when the gorilla comes out and starts running shit on that planet of the apes movie. We're all, the champs were thinking they were bad. I asked, are we going to have a little battles to see who's the most fucking Badass and the smart Shims, like I'm just going to make friends with this gorilla. That was an odd that I was surprised how much I liked that movie and love gorillas, man. When gorillas go crazy, I love it. It's primal, you know? As long as I'm not there, so it's not actually terrifying. I'm totally rooting for that gorilla. The gorilla comes down, just just goes crazy and all the chips are like, oh shit. It's kind of funny when you think about it, man.

Speaker 6:          01:51:10       He's fearless animals. He's fucking super animals that are going to take over downtown Manhattan. They're still terrified of that gorilla. I would love to see it's, I know it's impossible. I would love to see how much a huge gorilla could bench press. I bet they could throw around some insane numbers. If you look at their body structure, it's so ridiculous. Like a big one, like a big mountain gorilla. What do they wait like 600 pounds or something like that? 800 pounds. He imagined how fucking strong that thing was. Being there is so strong that they don't even have to climb in the trees to hide from the cats and shit like that. Cancer aren't going to fuck with gorillas. That is too much work, man. You know, you get in a tussle with a gorilla, you might not win those. They have fangs too. Yeah, it's the offense to it.

Speaker 6:          01:51:57       Really fixed skin and they are so much bigger than you. Man, this is so big and so strong. It's so crazy. It's weird. They have little decks. Super. We humans are the primates with the largest penises and it's all related to how many sexual partners are our females are likely to encounter. Really? Yeah. The gorilla kingdom is a patriarchal set up where he's got a Harem and those girls are all monogamous. There's no sexual competition between him and other rails. He has his own, he's had his Harem, so he has a little Dick. He doesn't have to have big Dick. Where's chips have big dicks? Those chimp bitches are freaks and they freak on, you know, and then with human beings they found that the more promiscuous, and this actually the animal kingdom

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       as well, the more promiscuous the females are, the larger the testicles are of the males. You know, it was even theorize that their specific sperm that go after and kill other sperm, that's their only job duty is to go after and attack the sperm of an but it turns out that that was just kinda of crazy speculation, or at least it's a mostly agreed by smart folks in the know about the subject that that's probably bullshit or most likely bullshit, but fascinating nonetheless to think that your balls grow, which is fact that you develop more sperm when you're around horse. That's real, man.

Speaker 4:          01:53:19       That means that since I went to San Diego state, I should have gigantic fucking really was San Diego state filled with with slutty girls. San Diego state is like, yeah. It's like if you're too dumb to get into like a good school. Oh really? No. You still wanted to party and fuck a bunch of people you were in. You were a girl.

Speaker 1:          01:53:37       Sounds like a movie. How can we pitch it? You write it and I know a dude who knows. What's that dude's name? Justin Timberlake. We could do it, man. We can make this happen.

Speaker 4:          01:53:48       Dude. One time I was at the, I was at the zoo, it's been at the sperm thing and this monkey was in the corner just jacking off in the corner of the zoo, but, and all the other monkeys were in a circle talking and uh, and so he jerks off and he finishes into his hand, no way. Finished it into his hand, but just standing there, he's not doing anything yet. And then he walks over to the group monkeys that's talking and he smears it on this one monkey's face and then he runs away. Right. And so I'm like, oh my God, I saw it. So she doesn't freak out or like go crazy or get upset. She just like calmly wipes or face smells it, and then licks it. And then she walks over to him and puts her ass up and they start fucking,

Speaker 1:          01:54:29       whoa. Yeah. So the way he got her to fuck him wants to come on her face real quick. Oh my God. That is, to me, black cats, those big black cats are the scariest fucking thing I can say. Even for whatever reason, more scary than tigers because tigers you like almost feel like he could never fight back. Right. And if you've got to talk about a Jaguar, it's like man, maybe might be able to live cause they're not that big. Well there there'll be 200 pounds fucking but account. Look at the muscles on that thing. I mean, come on man. If that thing, one of the, fuck you, is that a Jaguar? Fucking a cheetah? No, no, no, no. They're, they're, they're both leopards and the leopards are black too. Like the uh, like what the black ones, what they are is like, he actually has spots on them. They're just, most of his body is a spot I've had. They vary a little bit. I, whenever it sounds like a car alarm, right? They look so bad ass. It's such a freaky co creation. By, by nature, I mean look, look at the, just the physical form of this thing. Just designed only to kill, should really strong, really fast and wants to attack things that move in front of it. Like a ball of yarn. It's got such a kill driving. He rolled a ball

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       in front of it. It jumps on a ball. She's written back getting the Dick and to the, she helped him. Yeah. She's, she's gay marines around reaching down right now, trying to get it in. Oh really? Yeah, she is. Yeah. And uh, he'll get him. He's trying to get this wrong whole pitch. Let me try it again. I got to have, let me help. All right. Got To get back.

Speaker 6:          01:56:06       Look at the size of his fucking arms. Jesus Christ, man. Oh, here we go. He figured out the lounge position that's got a lounge style. He's like sitting back and he's got his hand on her shoulders like, bitch, you ain't going nowhere. Just let me hold on. You're right here. The size of his fucking body. He shot off.

Speaker 5:          01:56:25       Oh, and she's just checking in. She knows how to properly do it. You hold it in there and get, make sure all the come gets in your vagina's pregnant as what she's doing, isn't she? She's keeping the common, the vagina. That's what they do. A on some, some sides of this in Los Angeles,

Speaker 6:          01:56:43       the size of her bones, like when she puts her hands up, look at the size of the bones in the hand. That thing would fuck you up. Oh my God, it would fuck you up. Look at the size of that. It's crazy that they only eat like vegetables too, Huh? Yeah. Gorillas are insanely aggressive. Sanely strong and they eat like Broccoli or where are they getting their protein rubbed? Get those big ass muscles. Well I'm believe it or not, most vegetables have very high levels of protein, especially leafy green vegetables. We just think of protein is only being associated with animals eating steak or so, but there's a lot of protein and Kale. Kale is a massive amount of protein, so does Broccoli. If you eat like mad quantities of that stuff, you can get all, almost everything that you can get from meat except like the weird shit like aggression, you know, get the, the, there's something aggressive you get out of eating meat. I think there's something, I really do firmly believe that there's some something that happens when your body processes the fact that it's eating animal protein that makes you more aggressive. I really do believe it does.

Speaker 5:          01:57:49       Is there any part of you, Joe, that if at the end, the following phone photo that gets you kind of turned on? All right. Ready, ready, go.

Speaker 6:          01:57:56       Hmm. Wow. You got to think that's tight. It's all swollen and shit. Like if it's completely, there's no way that could be loose. Look out painful. It looks, if you get it cleaned out really well done, like they took my door. Am I feel so good? It might be worth it. Yeah. You might if you don't, if you could look off at the horizon, why you fucked that thing. Yeah. I mean look, it's basically like a fleshlight. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:58:19       How big is that? I don't know. That's about, it's like a humongous, uh, uh, pumpkin. Yeah. It's hard to, I don't know. I think there's a small monkey. Would you take it? Would you take that if it was detailed and cleaned out that that being an ass was detailed? Is that what that is that a baboons? Yeah. It is. Right? Yeah. What a weird, a weird animal.

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       Baboons as it looks like a dog sorta. Yeah. She had to pull up another picture of a baboons head man, baboons, a. They've also figured out how to raise dogs. Have you seen that now? Yeah. Baboons are so smart. They, um, they actually steal puppies, um, from, uh, from the mothers and they raised them and they raised them as guards and they, uh, they feed them and they keep them around so that they can sleep and the dog's stick around. The dogs would bark and something's going on. Yeah. That's fucking amazing. Fucking incredible, man. They're smart enough to realize that if you keep dogs, take them when they're puppies, he keep around, they lock onto you and you're the daddy just keep feeding them and then they, they bark when some shit comes around.

Speaker 4:          01:59:20       Yeah. I was watching this nature show the other night and it was, all these wolves were hunting air following them. And so there's all these wolves and, and they were, it was, they were in between these two mountains that sort of funneled into this one little place. So all the wolves are together, all of them leave. But one, one stays in this little like funnel and then they scare up some animals and animals run down to the funnel. And then that wolf that's waiting there for him like jumps on him, right? So it means they like made a plan and somehow non-verbally told one of the wolves, like, you stay here and we'll scare up pray that'll run to you. And then you fuck it up. She's crying. It's like, it's crazy. Like how are they communicating like that? Like is that happening? It's amazing. His baboons.

Speaker 1:          02:00:05       Yeah. What a weird looking animal. Right?

Speaker 5:          02:00:08       Look at their faces. They leave the safety of the cliffs to forage for food. Let's look a lion monkey. Check out those assets that has a really weird ass. Why is the answer now as the females up to 40 pounds as a heritage? Wow. That's incredible. Confusing me. But it's amazing. They fight on these walls. Oh, he just beat the shit out some bitch. Oh fuck. She got crazy. She did eat is better. Oh, she's mad. She's really like letting him know, but she fucked up. He looks mean. What a creepy fucking animal. How much dry is baboons travel? Overland and large groups for a reason. There are predators here, leopards, hyenas and cheetahs that face. So freaky looking man. They did it and it was like dog's snouts insects. Wow. Oh, like Avatar. Totally. Avatar Shit. Look at that. Then. It seems conscious. They've got companies, but it looks like an animal. Another army of baboons has also made camp on these cliffs. Oh Jesus Christ. How much spelled trouble have Boone trouble? How much dry is baboons will fight over flies. Why is Oprah doing this? She loves baboons

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       like all of us. She likes the baboons gas as much as ID really aren't like avatar creatures. Man is out there playing the piano. Awesome. I'm so happy that Africa exists. Yeah, but it can suck my dick. I'm not going there. I'm not going there. That is a crazy spot, man. Look at all this while we're looking at Q. Imagine if this was in like North Dakota. You managed it. If like you're driving in North Dakota, you have to deal with fucking packs of angry banded. It would be hyenas. Would it be completely hilarious though? Like if a game show came in there and just built like a toys r us or like a restaurant and just see how long it lasts back on country. All the garden Africa, Pat Boone's man, this is insanity on fear factor. You had to have done some kind of weird animal shit at some point.

Speaker 6:          02:02:34       Well, we avoided most dangerous animals except bowls. That was the dumbest episode that we ever did. There was only two episodes. Why ever protests and what we were doing. Oh, he's just jacking people. Oh, it's fabulous. Ruthless. Did he kill her? Oh whoa. That's fucked up life. I was the life and death to Sundays at, there's only two episodes, a fear factor that I ever protested. I said, we shouldn't do. Not shouldn't do, but I was like, I was like, wow, you got serious. One of them was riding a bull. I was like, this is, you guys are crazy. We, it was, we had an old stunt team. Then when the, in the early days of fear factor, they took, they were, you know, stunk guys were rough dudes. You know, they're like, I have someone's gonna get hurt. You know we're going to be all right, but someone might get hurt.

Speaker 6:          02:03:19       They were willing to take like way more chances. So they put people on these bowls and I go, hey man, I go, are these safe? I go, these are fucking bulls, man. How do you know there's going to be safe? He goes, well, these are these training bowls. Then. Then I even that aggressive, I'm like, do they know their training? She did. They know. I think they just think their boats. That thing is huge. Like a bull is another avatar creature. A bulls are ridiculous. This giant, stupid fucking cunt of an animal with huge horns and you're got to ride it and it's locked in a cage. They're going to open up the cage. You're going to hold on this bowl, the fuck outta here. That's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard in my life. I was like, you guys are just totally rolling a dice is whether or not these people are going to be okay.

Speaker 6:          02:03:59       And that's exact what happened over and over again. People are flying through the air, man. Everybody got launched off, but you just, you're going to get launched off period and you might get stomped. You might get kicked in the face. You might have to get your whole head reconstructed, but that's not a joke. Could stomp on you. Poor cow. We got the size of his deck. It's got strong on it and shit. Dirty bastard mill this size of that fucking bowl, man. It's gonna melt that shit. Look at the size of the muscles on that ball again. Each grass, that's all he's eating. And he's aggressive as fuck. Aggressive as fuck from eating. Hey, fuck you up. He's huge. He's got a giant Dick and he eats. Hey, wait, what was the other one you protested and look at this bowl.

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       Sex was the other one where their fear factor episode. That was the donkey. Semen one donkey. Semen. They, uh, I thought that was the dumbest thing I ever, I was like, you can't get people to drink. Come on man. I don't care if it comes, we're a donkey. Not like these volumes that they were, it was like 24 ounces. It was such a stupid amount of carb. It was like, there's no way you could do this. This is not right. You can't do this. And they were like, whoa. It past standards and practices and you know, we could do it. And I'm like, okay, Hey, what's both sex as a term in sex road? Bull sacks. I Dunno, what is it? Because when I googled images I, there's a lot of crazy shit that came on was probably some gay shit. Don't be looking at that. And if you do it, don't throw up in the keyboard. And they said, don't panic. Yeah. Straight out into the back. This door's locked for your safety because we were worried about you. But if you unlock that and go straight that, that star babies out of the way,

Speaker 1:          02:05:35       the other way. Powerful.

Speaker 5:          02:05:39       Oh, powerful. Justin Helpern. Yeah. Cool Dude. Right. Southern California kid. Are you up in San Diego? We're going to be this weekend. This weekend. I'm in Calgary. Bitch shows sold out the first show sold out the second show. This one

Speaker 1:          02:05:53       tickets left for the 10 o'clock show. It's a at the Jack Singer concert hall. I tweeted it today. Um, I can't, I can't tell you the, the link because it's so stupid. It's one of those a million, you know, character long links. But it's um, if you go to a, my Twitter today, it's today is uh, the 18th of July and it's a this Friday night, so it's too nice for now. It's me, Ari Shaffir and Duncan Trussell first show sold out and then we got a 10 o'clock show that still have some tickets available and then as a UFC the next night, harmful Calgary making shit happen up there in Canada. I love Canada, Dude. That's where you gotta go when the shit hits the fan. Coover yeah, that's a good spot. Perfect view. A lot of extra. See a lot of Asian chicks, mountains skiing. I know how much you love to ski.

Speaker 5:          02:06:47       If there was a redheaded Asian, I think that would be the best combination of Pantera. Do you ever see, cause I saw a blonde Asian in San Diego and it was such a weird combo that that's, that's rare if I was blonde bleach blond or was it a freak of nature? It was, it looked like white hair. Like I looked like matrix that the guys from the matrix shoot bleached white bleached it and it was really cool cause it was like a blonde girl that looked like an alien till you get down to those pubes. Those buttle here is that she hasn't kept up with, yeah, just don't have hair. They don't know that they were designed to try to get rid of the RFA. There's, there's different kinds of Asians but like Stan hope there's a whole bit about uh, Asian porn about it being like,

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       like rat Harris are like, is he, I forget what he says. Rat whiskers. Pubes but they don't have like arm

Speaker 2:          02:07:43       pit hair's usually or the carers or face hair. Like you never say we're talking about pubes so sorry. Oh, no. I was talking about, oh wait, I don't remember.

Speaker 6:          02:07:54       San Diego is one of my new favorite places to go. Hanging out at the American comedy company made me realize like how, what a great spot that is. Like that whole area, that little hangout area, that area call it again, remember where all the bars where it's call it. What's that area? Brewery. Not The brewery district. That's Columbus. You're your San Diego. Gaslamp gas gas. I've just seen such a great spot, man. We were just there for a, we did some shows in American comedy company and we were like, what a nice area. It says like everybody's walking around. It's like really cool.

Speaker 2:          02:08:26       I like the Indian dentist hotel by the way. That places. Yeah. Nice. It's that 10 year, 15 years ago. That was like skid row. Really? The whole thing. That's where,

Speaker 6:          02:08:36       that's where I like more Republican government, you know? That's why I like like conservative government. That's why. That's one of the things I like about a place like San Diego and its military presence. They like have way less bullshit going on.

Speaker 2:          02:08:51       Oh yeah. You know, San Diego is like, even even when like there'll be some at the bar Saturday night, there'll be some guys that lightly this and they'll be some fights and stuff. But it's pretty well policed. I mean like, and it's not like I never let it get to be where skid row is. Anello they would never let it get that far. The La skid rows were digitals. It's crazy. I think it wouldn't happen in San Diego. They would never let it happen. And there's some bad things about that. Like where they keep trying to close the pot shops down and they, you know, rest people for, they're really aggressive by alcohol after midnight, unless it's at a bar. They're aggressive about that. But you know what, that's how you keep a nice community. That sucks. But it's true. That's the only way they could make downtown work.

Speaker 2:          02:09:31       Downtown was crazy before then. Wow. So what started the change? There was just some developers came in and were like, listen, we're going to pump a ton of money into downtown. If you give us the permits, we'll pump the money and why. And so our government, I mean now our governments all fucked and San Diego, but, but what's wrong with it now? I'll all the hell that councilman stuff got busted for like, Oh yeah, he's trying to fuck her and stuff. Yeah. So we're broke now. Cities actually kind of let banks, did he get sued that and uh, he handed out some contracts to do through on strip clubs and stuff. Oh no, he didn't really, there was a bunch of shit. Oh that's beautiful. Yeah, he was rocking it. Old School. Yeah. Oh yeah. Old School corruption style. They were, he was trading contracts basically for hookers. Whoa. Like the strippers would, you know, like he go and they'd fuck him and strip for him and all kinds of shit. And then he would hand out contracts to the owners and he's living like a king. So when he came along, that was Hayden. I

Speaker 6:          02:10:34       obviously had a good racket and they were hating on him. Dude. Everything was going fine. It's a good place to live. Guy Like that run and shit is going to be happy all the time. So, but yeah, downtown they totally like revitalized it. And so it was just these one group, this one group of developers that just uh, starting with the money and then it all, it's amazing. It's amazing. Yeah. It's something to learn from. Cause I, I'll tell you that, uh, that place where we're, the American comedy comedy is, is really awesome and fun. Yeah. It's really cool cause that Brian's, that a chicken and waffle place. 24. Oh Jesus. Right next door to it. Yup. So fucking sweet area man. And there's a lot big police presence there too. A lot of cops we saw tons by the way, which is good. Keeps people from Duchenne. Yeah. But no, no place to smoke weed. But that knowing anywhere in San Diego, this isn't that bad. Dewey. Yeah. They don't fuck around. They don't fuck around. They treat it like it's like cocaine or something. Yeah. Same say coke. Wow. They go federal, they go federal on you in San Diego. They don't have to and they do. Really? Yeah. How bad do they do it? Like, what did they, do anybody know anybody who's been arrested yet? Or,

Speaker 4:          02:11:40       my buddy was just smoking a joint on the street. I'm stupidly, he's drunk, snow, smoking a joint on the street and he was in jail for five days. Uh, he had like all kinds of charges brought up on them. Like, oh they, they like bullshit stuff like intent to sell and stuff. Like, like stuff where he's just a guy smoking a joint on the street, you know? Wow. I was sweating a lot of joints this weekend. They just try to, oh one big conventions come in. Then they're chill.

Speaker 6:          02:12:07       Oh, they play Nice, nice comicon. You're not gonna, you're not gonna get busted for anyone. Wow. That's weird. That's even creepier. So this guy was in jail for five days. Did you?

Speaker 4:          02:12:16       Five days is it, couldn't figure out why they, like they kept saying he can leads like window it. He was broke. So He's like, what? He's like, when do I get out there? Like, I'm not sure. They're like held him for five days. Why did they do that? Because they just wanted to make a point. I mean they did. So they don't even charge you with anything. They're just hold you. He ended up getting charged. I can't remember. He got charged for, but he had, he had it. It was a big fine, you know, it's like a shitload of community service. It was like worse than getting a Dui. Wow. That's correct. We're just smoking one joint. Jungo was us. So maybe like a year and a half ago.

Speaker 6:          02:12:45       Wow. Fuck. San Diego. Real life. Yeah. That's really do that in the state of California because the state of California is really, when it comes to drugs, especially when it comes to schedule one stuff, which means scheduling on means that it doesn't mean it's the most dangerous, but it means that it's, it has no medical purpose. So like the thing about marijuana is it's lumped in there with like crystal meth and things that are useless. It's a lot of like lumped in there with like the worst drugs. The idea is that it's, it has no value but then scheduled to his cocaine scheduled to his heroin because there's medical uses for them. Wow. Yeah. So it's fuck that. It's ridiculous. So federally they're allowed to go after it as a federal crime,

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       even if under the state, you know, it's legal. It's a very tricky situation. Like the DEA can always come in and bust these medical marijuana places federally because federally it's a schedule one drug. Still the classifications insane. I mean it's, at this point in time, look, first of all, Tommy Chong guy on our phone, our show is perfect example of that. He's been using this hemp oil to a, to treat his cancer. He has cancer of the prostate. Yeah. And He's, he's 99% cancer free now. Holy Shit. Yeah. And he's been using this hemp boy shit and the psych, I just use it religiously. I changed my diet. I started eating healthy and boom.

Speaker 2:          02:14:09       Hmm. Sons of bitches and the federal government would come in and make that illegal. My cousin is a farmer in Brooklyn. Yeah, exactly. Now he's a farmer up by humble. Uh, they, oh Jesus. He has a real, he's a for real, but he sells to like dispensary's and stuff. So it's like kind of on the up and up. I mean he sort of, he didn't always, but he's, he told me, he's like, yeah, at any time the feds come in here and throw me in jail like crazy. And they take all your money. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:14:38       And they just choose one to do it. And anybody that's making any noise, like they had that show, we'd wars remember that show? Yeah. Well I saw that. I'm like they're going to get Boston. Boom. They got busted like right after the show got. Yeah. But the guy who made it was one of the guys that were featuring on the show. Who's your head? He runs this big medical marijuana dispensary. And when you run a, I mean I think there's something somewhere in the provisions where it's like you're not supposed to make like a lot of profit. And so like when you are a part of a big thing of medical marijuana collective, you're responsible for, even though a lot of money is coming in, you have to like make sure that it goes to places like goes to like you have to give some of it away to charity, pay your employee and he can't make it a lot of money off of it.

Speaker 1:          02:15:18       And when there's millions of dollars made, they just assume you're making a lot of money. It doesn't matter what you're doing with the numbers, whether it's legit or not, in their opinion, they're like, this guy is too big. We've taken them down. And so they just go after you. And if you have a safe by take your money and fucking good luck and that back, they take all your pot and they probably going to sell that, you know, I don't know what they do with it. It's if it's legal in the state, I mean, who knows, who knows what they're gonna do with it? I mean they, I mean, why would they burn it when it's probably worth millions of dollars? They would. What do you want to do here?

Speaker 2:          02:15:47       Yeah. What has happened all that pot. It's a good question. If you asked how many chunks as they steal it, what happens? Like they get a huge drug bust crossing the border. They burn it. They burn it. Yeah, they do in Mexico. I know they burn it in Mexico. They burn the coke, they burn, they burn. I don't know if they do that anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:16:04       Was it one was a one of the shows with Anthony Bordain, I forget where he was. He was in some South American company country rather, where they had this giant bust of cocaine and he was there while they lit the cocaine on fire. Yeah, and he was like, you know, like they were all, all the cops had thrown this stuff into like this ditch and they going to like pour gasoline on it and light on fire. I'm like, I would not want to be anywhere in any shape connected that fucking

Speaker 6:          02:16:30       event that looks like it's causing some drug dealers some serious fucking money and you're going to put that on a TV show. I'd be like, Oh fuck that man. Not My show. Bitch. Did you read that thing? There's a thing in New York

Speaker 4:          02:16:42       Time magazine a couple of weeks ago about this, the biggest drug dealer in Mexico, like drug cartel guy and uh, and what part of the essay? They said that he was having trouble figuring ways to get it to the u s so he just kidnapped some scientists and had them build him. A submarine

Speaker 6:          02:16:58       does ship fucking coke. Oh. Oh my God. Where did he kidnap a scientist from? Ah, I can't remember where they said, but like you basically just grabbed your scientist. He was like, hey, build me a coke submarine. Oh my God. Could you imagine exact fucking job and are you going to get out? They were going to let you free. Why would he ever let you free built him a coke submarines. He's going to let you free. You're in. Once you build the cokes out marine, you're in, as long as you keep producing shit for him, maybe he'll keep you alive. Yeah. Eventually you're gonna run out of Shit to do and you know too much. Yeah. You know where the coke machines parked, they gotta fucking coke machine that goes underwater. I mean that's what it is. It's a real live coke machine. The crazy thing is, is like

Speaker 4:          02:17:43       how much money is he making that he's just like, I don't know if this is going to work or not, but just here's a couple of Mil.

Speaker 6:          02:17:50       Probably even more than that. It's probably many, many millions to create a submarine. I mean have to bring in some serious engineers. You'd have to bring in some fabricators. Me, you want to start from scratch? Like how are you going to do this? Where are you going to get this submarine used to? You're really going to build one man. That is no joke. What's going to propel this thing? What do you, what are you using for fuel? Oh, you're igniting an underwater, you know what you're doing. You need to have subs really specialized education to build off fucking submarine. All right. That's no small achievement. No, you're going to have to call some other people. Dude. I wonder how many, I wonder how many scientists he kidnapped

Speaker 4:          02:18:29       that. Yeah, it was crazy cause it said that, uh, it said that he had built these giant tunnels underground that had like bathrooms and, and, and all kinds of shit. And then one of the tunnels got found out. That's when he was like, I'm so sick and tired of like building these great tunnels. I'm gonna build a submarine.

Speaker 6:          02:18:48       Wow. Wow. And imagine how terrifying it is to being in a submarine filled with coke. Oh my God. Dude in the ocean filled with coke and you're totally, by the way, illegally there, you're not supposed to be there. So at any point in time they can just light you up with missiles from a distance, you know? Also two dudes made it like under duress. So that might be some problems with it. It might be a bomb. I might wait to get underwater water and blow you up. You can't, you may mill the fucking sub, but then they'd probably killed the guy for sure. Imagine if the sub blew up till the guy who made it. Yeah, they'd probably kill you anyway. They really kill you if it blows up. That's the thing. It's like if you do too well working for a drug cartel, you're going to die.

Speaker 6:          02:19:32       If you don't do well enough, you're going to die. That's terrible job really. I really don't recommend it to anybody. It's the most chaotic idea ever. You're going to get involved in the world of international drug selling. You know, it's like the movie Scarface. How many of future like crazy tycoon, drug dealer dudes that movie inspire and really bad rappers. Do you remember the episode of the law? Was it um, Larry David curb your enthusiasm? We had, I'm crazy. I, Kyla is the rapper guy. It's one of the funniest episodes ever. It's really hilariously ridiculous. Over the top rapper dude who loves Scarface yet Scarface on 24, seven in this house.

Speaker 6:          02:20:17       It was so perfect. What a shit way to make a living man trying to sell coke. Fuck. Like, you know, it's going to end and it's like, it's like you're on a train and you don't know where it's going to hit the wall, but you know it's going to hit the wall, but until it hits the wall, you can party. Yeah. Well, that's what they said. They said that, so he lives this guy, it seems El Chapo and he lives on the top of a mountain somewhere in Mexico that has just like guards all around it and he just has like whores flown in. He has a whole soccer teams flown in to play for him. Oh my God. Jesus. But your basic prisoner, you can't like go out to dinner. Yeah. Well he serves sorta royal family and said he's like a royal family. I mean basically right.

Speaker 6:          02:21:00       We were talking about earlier, very similar. Yeah. And why, why does it exist? That's where it gets really cute. It's all because of the reason why organized crime exploded in America, in the, uh, the early days of the 20th century was because alcohol was illegal for a few years. And during that prohibition, that's when the organized crime families that were selling the alcohol got strong cause they were making a fuck load of money. Yeah. And then the, once you have money, you have momentum, you have momentum, you creating crime. People are getting rich and there was a lot of money in selling booze. People want to boost. The government was fucking stupid and they tried to keep it from the people and it became chaos. And that's exactly what's going on in Mexico. A big part of what's going on in Mexico is because of the drug war.

Speaker 6:          02:21:46       And because Mexico is a poor country that's right next to a rich country. And the best way to make money when you connect it to the rich country is seldom illegal shit. Cause the best way is there some shit that I have that you can't get. You need heroin. That's funny. I have heroin and then next thing you know it, they're just selling you what you need. It's, it's just supply and demand. You know they are like hustling. They're right next door to the machine. What does the machine need? The machine needs coke. You've got to get a coke and you don't even need to be like their product is so good that you can have a fucking retard sell it and he can sell out of it. Like you don't even need talented. Actually coke, coke gets those,

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       the coke role starts happening and people want more and more and more. And you chasing the dragon with it. That's a, it's a dark thing. When you watch someone chasing that, that Coke Dragon, it's a different thing than chasing the heroin drag and the heroin drag. And it seems like the people are having actually having fun. I like the heroines freaky to me because it seems like, like when you talk to people that have had it and it had the experience, like it sounds so beautiful. It did. It doesn't seem like it. You know, it, it, it remains at one point in time, almost almost worth some aspect of the loss that you're gonna get from these because it's such a mind blowingly beautiful thing when you do get the trip, but it eventually a row erodes. Yeah. I have a buddy who did a lot of heroin in, in college and he like made it out and as, and you know, unless people are just like that fucking evil dragon, hate it.

Speaker 1:          02:23:15       Like when they talk about their drug addictions, he was like, man, heroin was so great. Yeah. He's like, I can't do it cause it just fucked me up. But like it was so great. It's supposed to be like the most beautiful loving feeling ever. But it's such a trick because it's horrendous for your fucking body. It's horrendous. It's really dangerous. What does it make addicted to it? Do your teeth fall out if you're on heroin? Meth. He probably just not taking care of yourself. It's not like the drug makes your teeth fall out. He just become a fucking cockroach methods and a lot of coconuts from grinding her teeth and stuff like that. God, yeah, that's fucked up. How many drugs there are that can jack you legal or illegal. It's just, it's amazing how many things that we become physically connected to and you know, and it's, I don't understand the physio, the physical part of it.

Speaker 1:          02:24:03       I can completely understand like people that are obsessed with things and get gambling addictions and things along those lines. I can understand that kind of addiction, but the physical addiction doesn't, it doesn't. I don't have that, that that gene, whether it's for alcohol or a cigarette or I don't have that, but I know people who do, they can't do anything. They can't have a one simple sip of wine and then next thing you know, they'll be on this nutty downward spiral where they're doing shots and they're out of control and they're saying things they'll never remember it. I mean, that's how, that's a weird fucking aspect of being a human. It's got to be genetic. Partly genetic. What's the benefit of it? It's weird. Yeah. I Dunno. What's that? What's the drug that people are taking it and they're like eating people's faces off bath salts.

Speaker 1:          02:24:49       That's right. What the fuck is bath salt? Yeah, we'll the, it's funny that the cops are trying to pretend that it was weed. Like if that guy was on weed and he did that, he's just an asshole. It doesn't matter what drug is taken. It's not weed swinging it eat someone's face. I think it was just he was a crazy person. It could be that too. Yeah. It could not. It doesn't have to just be under the bath. Salts aren't detectable because it's not exactly, don't even know what the test is. Exactly. Don't they don't have a test for it cause it's all bunch of different shit. They apparently change molecules and Kevin Pereira was explaining it to us scientifically they take, can take any sort of a molecule and they change it by an oxygen molecule.

Speaker 6:          02:25:24       Doesn't necessarily change the effect of the drug. It's still effective, but it became, it becomes a different trip. And in this trip, you know there's one, some people were doing some wacky shit and you can buy it over the counter at places you can buy it. A, you know they called called bath salts because you're not, it says not for human consumption so you can just buy it. That's how they get around selling. Right, right. And then people smoke it sort of, sort of, but you know, Salvia is just a plant. Have you ever smoked Salvia? Yes. Let's that like, I don't know because I don't think I had a really quick of machines. I, I've talked to some people like Ari who like thinks he might have lived like a whole month at another and chin. Then I'll say that again without coughing. He, he felt like he lived a whole month in another dimension.

Speaker 6:          02:26:07       And then when he came back, his instantaneous, um, like it was like he went in and out here for five minutes and he remembers most of the, most of the time in that five minutes as a month long journey that he had with these families and he created friendships and there's a great sense of loss when the trip was over because he would never see his friends again. Salvia. Yeah, she said that, um, me and him had a long talk about it when really, because every time I've seen him do to salvage, not that, well, you don't know man. Maybe he didn't tell you exactly what happened and his fucking freaky little five minute trip, I didn't get there.

Speaker 5:          02:26:46       Taco and he was drowning and he couldn't, people were looking at them and all this other stuff. So not conscious. I don't know how many, it depends how, it depends how deep you go and do it. Like when, when I, when I've done it, I've done like the 40 times or to 60 times Salvia. And what it felt like to me is if you've ever done like a whip, it like a balloon where it's like Wah Wah Wah Wah, like last, like whatever, three minutes, five minutes. It was like that. But of mushrooms, like you're just getting thrown into the most intense mushroom trip or acid trip ever. And then it goes away and like five minutes and then you just feel like shit for like an hour or two hours afterwards. He just kind of feel like crappy, like worn out.

Speaker 6:          02:27:22       Well you got to take a lot of it and you've got to do, it's got to be strong and you gotta to do it the right way. It's gotta be heated to a certain way. I didn't crack lighter. Yeah, I didn't get it right. I got it to where it was like how to add a body experience. Just really simple out of body experience. Like I was over my right shoulder, like hovering, looking down at myself, and then would come muck and waves. I look at myself. And when you from up, that was it. And it only lasted for like five minutes. And I think feel like it was longer than five minutes. No, no, no. It felt pretty quick. I didn't even feel time. I don't think that's why I'm surprised that Ari felt the said dad because you don't really, I don't think you ever even think of time.

Speaker 6:          02:27:55       You just feel like you're dead. Yeah. I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure it's Ari. I mean, I don't, I can't believe I would fuck up and not think that maybe it was somebody else, but I'm pretty sure it was all right. He said he had like a whole like, month long friendships. That's not, that doesn't seem like Salvia, well, maybe it is, man. Maybe you just needed to take it at the right time, you know? Who knows? Trying hard enough to make fucking friends and your trip. Yeah, man. Maybe you're not really reaching out while you're tripping. Hmm. I think, uh, I think it's possible that, you know, you get different Salvia, that's different potency and you take it, you know, see, this is more like salary. This is when I did it. This is you. Yeah. Wait, this is actually you. He's actually tramping here.

Speaker 7:          02:28:42       You'll go, you're taking a shit ugly. You're shitting out sand seashells. I was on a water slide or something like that and I thought my face melted off. How you feeling?

Speaker 6:          02:28:59       Oh my God, Dude. Stop this embarrassing. Played it before a million times. We, you and I? Yeah. When we do, I don't, no, I don't think so. One of your other friends. It's ice house chronical. I wasn't there. How dare you? No, I mean, you've seen this before. I've showed it to you. I really don't think I've seen him. Really? That's craziness. Yeah, it was craziness. I've seen Ari's, I saw already when he got mad at. Yeah. Let me just check. It's not good legal. There you go. Bam. That Shit's illegal. Well, they didn't, that's not 100% legal anymore. Well, they're slowly starting to sneak it out, but it's not scheduled. It's not like schedule one, you know, it's like me going sampling marijuana. Yeah. They've started to make it legal or illegal rather. Um, but they didn't know there's some other shit that's, that's legal to, there's some stuff that they don't know about that's like, you know, five methoxy dimethyltryptamine that slide that's legal.

Speaker 6:          02:29:45       You can buy that. He used to be able to buy it online. It used to be able to buy it from a research chemical companies, not for human consumption. You'd be able to buy it online and it would just blow your fucking mind. You'd go to another dimension. Totally legal. That's not going to mean for human consumption though. I think if you use it, you actually in violation of the law by virtue of the fact that it's chemically related to something that's illegal, it's like really close to her cousin to something that's illegal. Yeah. Like what scientist is sitting there like figuring out what the fuck you up that night. Asshole scientist, asshole scientists. Creative bath salts to bag. You know, this dude's out there working on the cure for aids and guys like, Nope, I want some scarier meth. Some method. Even meth people would tell you to quit bath salts.

Speaker 6:          02:30:35       We just getting weirder and weirder as a society. Have you heard of Ken Com? Yes. That's not real though. It's not. No. It's like a lifestyle. Yeah. It's fairly horseshit. A drug that uh, they make with a poop. Oh yeah, that's fake. It's fake. Yeah. Fuck. I wanted that to be real. It just thought it was real too. I thought it was real too. I think maybe people have tried it, but I don't think it works. It will trip you out smelling shit. Dows your drug of choice. Boy, when you want to talk about like how bad Africa must suck, that someone's willing to believe that because you were saying in Detroit they're smoking their own shit. He'd be like, no, stop making that up. That's sniffing for shit water to get high in Detroit. Stop it. But in Africa you're like, well, they probably are. Yeah. I mean they get to figuring out some way to get fact up to there. You immediately assume they were right.

Speaker 6:          02:31:34       It seems like, okay, what am, what else am I supposed to believe? They smoke. I smoke this shit. He ever seen the one video on a African fish farming where they have like a pond filled with fish and the run in with baskets. They, everyone runs in. Everyone in the town runs in, into the, into the water and catches the fish with nets and with their hands. Thousands of people. And they run in and they catch every fish in this pond. It's a shallow pond. The catch them all with their hands and baskets and shit. And they do it all at once. Huh? Who is it? That's dot Merera powerful dot. Merera let him come. Come on in. They just run into the, yeah, it's crazy. They run in. Have you seen that Brian? The video where the dudes in Africa, they run into a, upon the fish for it. Pull it up cause it's crazy. See if you could find it. When I say African African pond, uh, fishing with their hands. Village. Janka see if you can check 'em butthole. Yeah. I don't know if you're going to find it Lucia to no, that's not it. You know that Sunday? That's a little girl. How dare you? I don't know. Africans catch fish with their hands.

Speaker 7:          02:32:57       Yeah. You banging

Speaker 6:          02:33:00       it or is this a Google search? Here's The fucking asteroid attack and, and we're all just like back to like basic civilization. Like Africa is going to be like fucking New York because they're the only ones you want to do anything. I know they could still like the people in the Congo that like catch fish by hanging from trees. Have you seen those guys? Justin Helper and Justin Helpern tomorrow. Nice to meet you. Dot. Merera shows up nice and early for the super show, which will be taking place in less than one hour. Have a seat. Dumb, relaxed. You've got a cocktail, you look comfortable. You got your notebook. The mother fucker never stopped writing. Leverage. Laser gentlemen never stops. He's a pro. Yeah. Any way you want to sit. So Justin, let me, let me, we're going to end this podcast and we'll, we'll, uh, start the icehouse chronicles in the wild after we come back from a break. But Justin, you have a new book out. It's called I suck at girls. And, uh, tell me why do soccer girls, you seem like handsome, intelligent guy. I looked at the cover and I said, this doesn't even make sense. I can understand that you have a crazy dad and he's very entertaining. But what's just a misprint? Was this supposed to be at? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was the original title. Uh, no. I mean it, most, it takes place in the past. Uh, I mean it's all chronicle like nonfiction story.

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       My Dad's in a lot of them. I'm not stupid. He's in it. Um, yeah, I mean it's just basically like a bunch of stories everybody has about, you know, your fucking Shitty proms and this then, you know, uh, losing your virginity. And

Speaker 6:          02:34:32       do you ever worry about running out of dad stories? A resource? It's been very good to you with that vein and dry it out. I know I might've tried it out with,

Speaker 4:          02:34:46       maybe I have a few. Uh, I mean it, yeah. I don't know. I figured, well, I'll let them all out there and hopefully I won't need it

Speaker 6:          02:34:53       then we'll need it anymore. That's my heroin. That's my gen chem. Well, you know, as a guy trying to make it as a screenwriter, what a fucking awesome break that was for you. The whole thing was just so, it's so fortunate and so interesting. Yeah. I love when stories like that happen. I love when it shows that there's a lot of like really talented, funny people out there. They just never do anything with it. There's a lot of people out there that are really funny and really talented, but for whatever reason, nothing clicks for them. They, they can't figure out how to make that connection to it manifesting itself in the real world. It was just, they become these really funny people that have jobs working for, you know, whatever company I'm insurance company or whatever it is, and for whatever reason, they just never fucking figured their way into the river. They never, never crawled to the bank. Just didn't have the balls to jump in. It's too bad.

Speaker 4:          02:35:46       I mean, for me it was just like, it was such a crazy break. Right? It was like lightning in a bottle and then luckily I had sort of been doing, I'd been writing for a few years, so it was like, all right, well, you know, let me get my shot. Like let me get my, let me take my at bat

Speaker 6:          02:36:02       surface. Yeah. Had that board. It's beautiful. It's an awesome store. I'd love hearing stories like that where someone just is doing something good and just by virtue of the fact that other people are telling other people and it spreads and then then everybody hears about it. That's how I heard about it. I didn't read it in any publication or anything. Everybody was like, dude, check this out. This guy's hilarious. And I would go check it. I read a few of them laughed out loud. I follow. This guy is funny. It's funny how it happens, man. It's beautiful. So there's a real organic occurrence.

Speaker 4:          02:36:29       Oh, thanks man. Yeah, it's been, it's definitely like a, it's funny too, cause like after the TV show got canceled, people like, Oh, you must have been so fucking pissed. I'm like dude, I got a TV show on the air for write down fucking shit. Are you stupid? I'm happy that everything like nothing, you know, there's nothing that was going to bum me out of it.

Speaker 6:          02:36:49       That's a great attitude. And that's so important to, for success in life, to have that kind of attitude and just enjoy it and appreciate it. Work hard, enjoy it and appreciate it. So many people and then something happens and then it goes away from it and they can never appreciate it. They ever even did it. Yeah. It's just neurosis trying to get to the next level or stay on that level or you know, get the next thing is you don't feel like you're drowning, you know? So a show business is a very weird world man. It's very weird. Yeah. It's so funny too cause like, and since then have worked on a couple of other shows, but on writing staffs, other shows and stuff and, and I've seen like that's how it is. Like every writer I work on the show with, he's like, fuck, this is so this is going to get the fuck am I gonna do next year?

Speaker 6:          02:37:31       This is fucking bullshit. I hate this job. And I'm like, dude, like two years ago I was waiting tables. Like that's kind of a shitty job. Like we're sitting around making Dick Jokes for fucking 12 hours a day for a TV show. You're a writer on a television show, like is there, there's not that many more prestigious positions in Hollywood besides actor and producer, writer, a creator, the person who, the creative force behind the TV show, that's fucking huge. There's not a lot of people to get to do that. Yeah. That's a massive, huge bill. Fuck, I can't believe the shit is going to get canceled. This fucking piece of shit. It's hard for people to appreciate shit. It really is. Yeah. Are a lot of negative content here. And plus and in Hollywood, it's also seems like unlike you, where you just rode this, you know, this opportunity and you capitalize on and made the most of it.

Speaker 6:          02:38:21       Some people just get failure after failure, after failure, after failure, after minimal success. And by the time they have a little bit of success, there's so like condition to failure and they're so worn down by it. Their spirit is broken. Yeah. Oh, they brought in cheeseburgers, order food. He fucking savage. Look at you. You don't play games fucker. Cow. Cow Can suck it. And he got wings to Brian's like, you're your die can suck my dick. That's what he just said.
