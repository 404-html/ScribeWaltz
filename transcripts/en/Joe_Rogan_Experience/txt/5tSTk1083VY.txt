Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Five, four, three, two, one. Boom. And we're live. Thanks for doing this man. I appreciate it. Thank you for having me. Appreciate it. You're the only guy I've ever had in the studio where and when I showed up, you were working out. That's what I do, man. That's my life. That's my life. It's pretty crazy though. I mean, how much time did you have when you got here? I got here about an hour early. Oh, okay. Okay. I got a little early so I got here. Shirt off doing chin of. He's hilarious. I didn't get my camera out in time for you saw me. I wanted to take some pictures or maybe next time. Next time we'll catch you after the show. Um, you are a guy that for a lot of people you sort of embody the idea of hardening your mind, right? And figuring out a way to do things that most people think are impossible.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       That's. You've sort of become that guy over your life and you become that guy for a lot of people, including me online. We've talked about you on the podcasts a ton of times. Right? So having you in here has been a very exciting to me. I appreciate that. Thank you. How'd you become that guy? You know what? I grew up. Not that guy. Yeah. So a lot of people put a title on me. They went to a, they see me now. They see me now as the guy with his shirt off, we can do 4,030 pull ups and 17 hours. You can run five miles and 39 hours who can do all this crazy shit. But when they don't understand is they don't understand the journey that it took me to get to this point. And what got me to this point was I was just the opposite of what I end the day.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       I was that guy who ran away from absolutely everything that I got in front of me, but not many people knew that I had two people at the, at like the real me was like this very scared, insecure stuttering got beat up by his dad and all this kind of stuff. And I built this fake person that walked around like my shit didn't stink, you know? Yeah. So that was, that's kind of how I did it and I do a process of time. I realized that I was lying to myself lying to people. But it's a fascinating journey though, because you are that guy now when you genuinely are legit bad ass at one point in time you were legit. Terrified person. Yes. So what was the process like? How did, how did you step forth? Well, it's a, it's a long process. Um, I, my dad beat the shit on me and I was growing up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       I was the first black betty born in this hospital called Millard fillmore in Buffalo, New York. My Dad don't skating rinks. He owned bars. He ran prostitutes from Canada to Buffalo, New York. My Dad was big time pimp, big time. Anything bad about a person, big time hustler. He was American that I moved with them. Denzel Washington. He was at but not that bad, you know, he wasn't that big, but that's what it me of. He was that kind of guy and beat the shit out of me, you know, I'll have my mom. There was an incident one time when my mom got knocked out and top of the stairs and he drug her down the stairs by her hair. It at six years old on their. Forget this in my mind, I was always afraid. My whole life I was afraid of. I had this fucking voice, this conscience that would always be battling me saying, hey, you gotta get up and do something.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       I didn't want to do shit, you know, I was just afraid, but I would that, that voice would force me to get up. And my dad, you know, I tried to beat him up or whatever at six and I get my ass kicked. So this went on for several years and have a big time. Lauren disability can. My Dad didn't believe in us going to school. So my dad, it was about the business, the skating rink and the bar. So the skating rink opened by 7:00 at night and this time I was able to walk. So about five, you know, four or five, six years old, eight, nine. And I go to the skating rink is 7:00 at night. And I worked the skating rink until 10 at night and then we will scrape the gum off the floors and we cleaned the whole skating rink up and then my dad had an office in my brother and myself asleep in the office and my momma go upstairs and work the bar until 3:00 in the morning and then they cleaned the bar up.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       So after all that shit was done with going to school, rarely happened. So when I went to school, I was all kind of, you know, my, my learning disability, I had social anxiety. I was just a jacked up kid from living in this tortured home from the outside looking in. We lived in an all white neighborhood and then we would travel to the ghetto of buffalo in New York with the skating rink. Was that. So we, you know, we worked around mostly blacks and I lived around mostly whites, but no one knew what was going on in that house to, onto a one paradise road. Yeah, I mean, it's crazy. But, um, my mom got courage to finally leave him when I was eight years old. We moved to a small town in Brazil, Indiana, and that's when the real war started for me and Brazil.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       Indiana is a small town, great people, a lot of great people. And I say that because a lot people get offended and I'm going to get to the point where they get offended. There was about maybe 10 black families at about 10,000 people in town and in 1995, the KKK march the fourth of July parade. So this was a. not everybody was racist. It was a lot of good people in the best people I knew was there, but there was also a lot of racism there. So me being one of the few black kids net in that area, you know, it, it kind of haunts you. I had stuff in my notebook, you know, Nigga, we're going to kill you on my Spanish notebook. They had that on my car, Nigga, we're going to kill this early nineties. And um, so even though I showed it didn't hurt me, it was jack and me up.

Speaker 1:          00:05:39       So all the insecurities I have and I was a kid with my father. I've moved into this area here and it just got worse and worse and worse and it haunted me and that voice that talked about it kept talking louder and louder and louder. I was doing nothing about it and I decided to make moves and I cheated all through school and it's kind of humbling to top of my stories sometimes. And this is, it's also embarrassing, but um, it's real is who the fuck I am is what I am as it's created me and copy from the fourth grade to the, to my junior year in high school on every assignment and I want to get in the military. When I joined the Air Force and the guy gave me as vap test, it's like a watered down and sat and I couldn't copy on it because the guy beside me had a test a test b.

Speaker 1:          00:06:29       They got him a right tessie. So I've looked the copy on this test and I couldn't copy on her. So I got like a 20 and I wanted to be an air force pararescueman as guys that jump out of airplanes and saved down pilots. It's a, it's a special operator in the air force and my score was so horribly low that as we take it again and he said, hey, I got an 18 the second time, even worse, I need to get a 50 out of a [inaudible] 99. And so my mom and I for a while, we lived in a government subsidized apartments, $7 a month and also food stamps and we slowly moved up to $230 a month place. But at the time, you know, you know, pretty poor. But I'm, my mom afforded enough money for me to go to see a tutor one one hour a week.

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       So for four hours a month and had six months to study for our last test. I'm going to take the Asvab test three times. And I studied my ass off and passed it. And I got in the air force and realized there was more things in front of me. I was afraid of water, terrify the water and um, I learned how to swim. But what gets everybody in this training and all special ops training is to water confidence where they try to pretty much drowned your ass, you know, all of our lives we've been breathing and they take that from you and they want to see how comfortable you are in the water. And there's only one percent African Americans in special operations and I didn't know anything about African, like a lot of them are negative, buoyant, which I am because the bone density.

Speaker 1:          00:07:55       I struggled but I'm six weeks into the program there was about 25 guys left. I have about 150. I was there and I was never. I didn't go to sleep for six weeks of the program and I wanted to quit so badly, but it quit everything in my life. I copied through school. I wanted to prove people wrong. And so here I am in this air force program starting to get a little more confidence, but this water was kicking my ass and six weeks in the program that Dr gave me a blood test and was I have sickle cell, sickle cell trait. Not The anemia but still kill people, but so they pulled me out training for a week and when you go from being very uncomfortable in that water situation and then now you're comfortable and I'm sitting back watching the guys drown. I'm not, you know, I'm not part of the activities anymore for this week.

Speaker 1:          00:08:41       I wouldn't get back in that damn water again. So the fear overcame me and all my insecurities from my dad from this small town, from everything started coming back and even though no one knew how fucked up I was kind of create this other person who was tough. I live with shit all the time, so me not wanting to go back in that water. The doctor called me back up, I thought to get like a, like a medical kick out of the military. So no quinten for me. They kicked me out so I can have some pride that Dr said, no man, we can, you know, we could put you back in the training. And I was like fuck. But after a week I'm like, you know what? I missed one week. There's only three weeks left is a good chance, you know, I could tough this shit out and go on, but went back to the CEO and the commanding officer of the program and the sergeant said, hey, you guys start from day one because you missed, you know, that, that we could train him.

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       And I broke, I broke. I, I, I couldn't imagine going back through that again. So I made up a lie and I said, man, there's sickle cell things really scare me. It was the fucking water wouldn't sickle cell. And I pretty much quit even though they gave me a medical. It was, I quit. So I'm from the age of 19 to age 22, I went into the job called Tac p where you control fast movers behind enemy lines. Cool job. But there's no water. I was afraid of the water, so I avoided it. And um, again, 125 pounds in that timeframe, I went from one 75 to almost 300, two to 97 was my heaviest and I started finding things that was comfortable and the more things I found comfortable, the more uncomfortable in my mind was because that voice I was telling you about it, it always was there.

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       I was just trying to avoid that conscience. I, I wanted to be left alone from that conscious and it wouldn't leave me alone. So I got out of the air force and I started working for job corps. Ecolab re spray for cockroaches at 24 and I'm spraying a different stake in shakes, red lobster, whatever from 11:00 at night at 7:00 in the morning. And what changed? I came home and watched this discovery channel show, um, class to 24. I came home from steak and shake. I sprayed it down last, get a big old large 42 ounce shake while crossing the street and get a box that mini donuts from 7:11. Now I drive home for 45 minutes. This big old fat guy who. Yeah, I worked out, but I was fat. I didn't run, didn't it pt. I hit the gym. So I'm driving home, turn the TV on and what comes on and discovery channel.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       So, and that's where everything changed for me. I uh, was taking a shower. I walked out here, these guys and I watched the show and it made me reflect big time on the piece of shit that I am and I'm exactly what people said I was going to be. So, so what was on this show that really struck home? It was, um, I saw these guys going into water so I was terrified of it. I mean I can't even express have you ever had a big fear and I know a lot of fighters have fears and stuff like that, but they get over them, but a lot of us have these fears that you just don't want to fucking face. And um, I have a lot of them, had a lot of them and that's what created the person who's in front of you today and it will get into that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:50       But I'm just scared. Bitch is what I was an but I was watching these guys going through hell week class to 24 and he's guys ringing the bell, quinten dropping their helmet down, rolling out. A lot of guys is leaving and it made me reflect on my fears, my insecurities, and I saw real men wear, I thought were real men who are staying, who are overcoming adversity, who were overcoming all these different things that I had blamed so many fucking people in my life. My Dad met my mom for not being there when I was 14 years old. My mom was gonna get remarried to this great guy. He got murdered and then I moved back to a small town in Brazil and, and everybody was applying my learning disability, my, my skin color, you know, meet me being everything. And so, um, I sat there for awhile and I was like, man, I gotTa Fucking, I've got it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       No one's gonna fucking come to help me. No one's going to fucking come to help me. It's fucking me against me period. And um, so I had to man up and I said, first it got started doing his face in every fucking fear, a half, no matter what the fuck it is, man. And, and, and these things would keep me up at night. No one p people who are hearing this shit, they will never really understand and grasp when you face these things and so many things, how they keep you up and haunt you at night. I think there's a lot of people out there that know what you're talking about. I mean, and um, so that's what it did. And I had two options to either be that 300 pound guy who's spraying for cockroaches and made a thousand dollars a month. And at 24 years old knowing without 50 fucking years old, I can reflect on this and think about what guy never became.

Speaker 1:          00:13:29       Or I can totally just sack it up and fail and fail and fail entire succeed. So I started calling recruiters up. I said, I'm gonna. Go be a fucking navy seal. And every recruiter. So there's a weight and height, his weight and height limit for to get in the military and I was six foot one and two 97 and I had a prior service which was a big deal. So I called all these recruiters up and all of them said, hey, what're you blah blah blah blah. They got into conversation. Steve Vai is even qualified and by the time I got to my weight would hang up pretty much like, hey, you know what, call somebody else and they'll try to get in the reserves. So I tried to get the reserves and I called this guy named Steven Sal job recruiter up and he said, hey, come on in.

Speaker 1:          00:14:11       He saw me put me through the weight standard, all this other stuff, and to get into the class I had to get into how to lose 106 pounds in less than three months. So I was like, fuck that. I can't do that. I grabbed my chocolate milkshake and went back to Ecolab. I'm going to back to work, man. This is my life. So in this job you look, you're looking for cockroaches looking for rodents and stuff like that. And this next morning or the next night I went to work and I hit the all that cockroach is too much. I hit the mother of cockroaches and this restaurant got full of cockroaches and rodents and everything else and I sat there and said, this is my life. I said, this is my life. You are exactly who the fuck this is it. And I said, this ain't going to be it for me.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       So in that restaurant, I quit my job, left my canister in that restaurant, my, my spray canister, got back in my ecolab truck and I went home and I started working out like somebody I was. I became the most obsessed person on the planet earth. And I was basically, I had to invent a guy that didn't exist. I had to invent a guy that can take any pain, any suffering, any kind of judgment, be called nigger because whatever the fuck in the world and be able to stand in the fucking room and say go fuck yourself. And it built out to build this callous mine and I built it through suffering. I built it to downright fucking just crushing myself. If it was raining outside, 3:00 in the fucking morning, it was snowing. The fourth thing is don't go out there and do shit. My instinct was we got to fucking go out there.

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       Anything that was fucking horrible in my life that I would normally say no, that was inhumane, that most people I had to go do it. And I started callous in my mind at this point in my life. And I lost the weight and lost weight. And I went back to recruiter. I got into that class and I went through three navy seal hell weeks in one year. Only guy to ever be in three hell weeks in one year. To my knowledge, the first one, I didn't make it through the next two I did. And um, that I just didn't, I didn't stop it anymore from there. And I started realizing through this, through this process that the fucking mind is what you created. And I started opening different doors that I didn't think were even there. They didn't think even existed in the more doors opened up, the more I started realizing that my potential is damn near endless it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       And it changed my whole mindset. So I went from David Goggins, I created Goggins. And that journey is a priceless journey that is hard for me to even explain to people because it sounds so quick and easy that guys lost this weight. And I went through three hell weeks. I went to ranger school, I went to Delta Force lex into whatever it is. It was brutal. It's a brutal journey every fucking day and every well, are you happy? If anybody knows my life story and I try to give you a, just a snippet of it. Where I'm at today is in front of Joe Rogan telling you my life to get through. I became to get through where I'm at now. There's nothing but prior to half for myself that I can't really. I can't really show people because I had this face and his face that they see like, are you happy?

Speaker 1:          00:17:25       What's wrong with you? I'm driven, I'm obsessed, and that's what you see said. People need to hear the story. This is a. This is an exciting story for people because there's a lot of people out there that field trapped and they feel stuck and they feel like they can't do anything. This is who they are. You're a guy who felt that exact same way but figured out how to not be that person and be a person that you would admire. How did you. What were the first steps? Like you had some slips before, right? Because you. You quit because of the water thing, but then when you went back the second time, when you decide you're going to lose all that weight and you quit that job did. Did you. Was it just straightforward from there or whether there's some days where you just failed and then you picked it back up again?

Speaker 1:          00:18:08       So my first run when I decided to lose the weight, I was like I said to 97, I was about 32 percent body fat and my idea was to run four miles from my first run. I didn't know how bad it's going to fucking hurt me. I used to run before I was fat and I was like, fuck it, I can do this. I ran a quarter mile and walked home. I walked home and sat on my couch and cried. I went to my mom's house who was about 40 about maybe 20 minutes down the road and cried and getting her out. Say, man, I can't fucking do this shit. I don't know. When do I, uh, just got somebody pregnant. My life was this fucking. I was making thousand dollars a month. My rent was eight, 10 a month. And my mind just kept fucking with me and kept fucking, you're not good enough, man.

Speaker 1:          00:18:50       This isn't for you man. These guys are bass motherfuckers on the planet earth. You're not that. And um, what it was, and it's kind of funny. I was obsessed with rocky, rocky one in particular and now as a kid I come everyday now watch this fucking show rocky. And I would fast forward with the little vhs tapes to round 14. Around 14 fucked me up like nobody's business. Why this song came on, right, so when I bought the pull up record, I listened to the song for 17 hours is two minutes and 13 seconds and I'm able to visualize and dream like nobody's business and I know that I can create a vision that many people can't and I work for it. So the vision I had was when Apollo creed beat the fucking shit out of rocky, beat the shit out of him. He kept fighting.

Speaker 1:          00:19:45       He was a dumb fighter, couldn't read, couldn't fuck that was me, couldn't read, couldn't write, just punchy everything a bottom and rocky beach or shelving. He isn't at coronary, but I was saying stay the fuck down. And him getting up, him getting up a poetry raises are they've been fucking turnaround thought he wanted to fight. He turns around and sees this guy getting up and it was the face of Apollo creed that changed my life. The face of Apollo creed. It was like just by that motherfucker getting up, not winning just by him getting the fuck up. Apollo creed was champ. He's best. Rocky had taken his soul, had literally taken his soul. His head goes down, he looks at him like, who? What the fuck are you? I want it to be that not rocky. I want to be the guy that people looked at it, I don't give you like me or didn't like, oh, I don't care, but it said this motherfucker's gonna keep coming after whatever the fuck is in front of him.

Speaker 1:          00:20:45       I wanted that. I wanted that. I wanted that worse than anything in the world, so that is. I kept picturing me falling down and getting up and every motherfucker call me nigger. I was dumped. Even myself, even myself, I wanted to feel something besides two feet. I want it to go the distance and that going a distance pushed me to a point of where now go way past the distance. So you go the first day you, you run a quarter mile and you walked back home and you're, you're upset. How do you, how do you move forward? So basically what I did was I came home and I had a chocolate milkshake. I sat down, I gave up. I said, this ain't gonna fucking happen. I can lose 100, six pounds and I can't even go a quarter a fucking mile.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       I started being able to take negative shit and be happy. And this whole. I say, what if a lot. It sounds Corny, it sounds weak, but it's true. One of the recruiters said, there's not many black navy salesman. I was a 36 African American steel in history. It's an overset careers because the fucking water, you know, I mean people get mad at me. It's fucking true. Just get over it. And so I was like, man, what would it be if my fucking fat dumb lie in to be friends with people? Insecure ass can overcome this shit and that would, if mentality that, that, that dreamer mentality just with always fuel me. It was fun, man, what if I can be, but if I can be a seal man, what if I can go from wearing a quarter of fucking mile now are going toward and five miles.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       What if I can go with just what if I can go in and, and what if, how would that feel if I'm graduating, kind of get at that graduation thing. I talked about 2:24 that I like the video. I sat down and watched this man officer stood up and he said to the graduation, um, gas graduate graduating buds, like 18 of them, he said, we live in a society where mediocrity is often rewarded. And he went on to say something about these men detest mediocrity. And I wanted to be a man that detest mediocrity. It all, it got me a lot of trouble in the seal teams and going forward in my life because I just, I started looking down on people for not going hardest fucking shit. And I started to create different things, but that's for a different day. But I just believed that, you know, my whole mind changed.

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       That is a problem that a lot of people work hard to have. You get angry at people who don't work hard to the point where you, you know, you want to insult them, you want to, you want to smack them, and it's really because you're scared of seeing that in yourself. Yeah, that's probably the truth. That's probably the truth. So I guess a lot of times month I would see people and it probably was a direct reflection of who I was and I would get mad at them, but in reflection it's probably just be getting mad at myself for me, 100 percent when I, when I see people that are half assed and things, I get terrified of seeing that in myself and I get mad at them. Right. And it's, it's not a good way to handle it. No, but it's natural because you're just terrified of seeing that trait.

Speaker 1:          00:23:59       Right. And it cost me. So you come back, you do the quarter mile, right? You walk back home. How do you regroup? So what I did, I sat down there and I put rocky and I got my milkshake rocky. I seen what I was big time in rocky and platoon. Why Platoon, I love to see people who were getting beat down and there's scenes they're scenes that this drove me and people in my hell weeks, you know, I was in three of them. They'd always hear me singing these songs, these songs, humming these songs in torturous situations when you're, when everybody's quitting this fucking code. I would be somewhere gone somewhere fucking gone. If somewhere fucking dark as shit. There's a senior platoon when he lies, when Barnes shoots relias and you know, they think he likes his dad and the choppers are taken off and Charlie Sheen's, ask him, you know Tom Berenger, Rizzy, Elias, regionalized, William Defoe.

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       Oh, I found them back their dead somewhere and through the woods the Viet Cong is chasing he through the woods and shoot him in his fucking back and all he wants to do is get to the fucking chopper. He's getting shot in his back is getting up, getting shot back. He's getting up and you see this guy who's fighting. I love the fucking guy who just fucking fights. And so I put these things in as reminders that you're going to have to fucking suffer, man. This fucking point two, five, man, this man, you're going to have to fucking suffer to, to, to, to go from this fat insecure motherfucker too. One of the best guys on the planet earth. This journey's could take something that is going to be incomprehensible to most people and these different visualizations. How I visualize it in my self talk, it became so nasty and dirty that I almost liked the fact that I went point two five.

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       So it became from being defeated too. Like, man, all right motherfucker. Maybe you know, maybe the Marvin go point seven, five, you know, it just became this different mindset. I turn negatives into positives, so I will, I will take it like who? Who would even think about doing this? So I would sit in my car saying, who had two 97? Who can't fucking swim? That gray, who scared the fucking water? We had the fucking balls, little balls to fucking man up, quit a job and go and it put everything on himself. So it's how I started talking to myself and put myself in a whole different category that would fuel me the next day and I just kept using that as fuel and fuel. No one would do this shit. No one would do this shit. You're the baddest motherfucker around your bass. Motherfucker ever live. And I had ice kept fueling me with the, with the right kind of message that I needed to hear.

Speaker 1:          00:26:35       That was never telling myself. And through time it became reality to myself. So you start out on the first day and then do you start running again the second day? Second day we're wrapped back after it again. But I started realizing I can't run that far. Right? So the idea was I became damn near a professional cyclist with the miles. I put it on the bike. So I never, we never watched TV. I had to be doing something. So I was riding the bike. I rode a bike a lot to, to lose the first initial kind of weight because my bones were hurting so bad. My bio is broken. I learned to get over that also. And I tried to swim a lot, I wasn't a great swimmer, but putting fins on kind of equalized my body. I wasn't so negative, buoyant. So I started fitting a whole bunch and I spent hours in the pool hours in the pool, trying to get more and more comfortable.

Speaker 1:          00:27:23       Not because I was going underwater, I was so scared of the water that I had to live in. The water had to become one with the water. So going into the pool used to scare me. So I went to the pool an awful awful lot. And then the bike got easier. I was able to run more. I went from like one mile, one mile was a great accomplishment to miles and then from two to three was a big. And then I went from three to six and then like they have a warning order that they get people to get ready for butts and the whole thing was running six miles five days a week and that was my goal. And so I just kept. I failed, I go back to scratch. I use some positive motivation. I have like one day where I'm like fucking defeated, but I started realizing this is part of the process that's a part of that journey.

Speaker 1:          00:28:10       I had to realize this is part of my process versus just saying like I used to, I'm just not good enough. If I'm not good enough, we always say that shit, I'm just not good enough and then try something else. I'm going to fucking make myself good enough and that became my mentality. I'm gonna, I'm gonna. Make myself good enough, and so I'm misunderstood a lot, but that's. That's all it came down to. I made myself good enough and the days I couldn't run that for the next week I would do two a days, so on the running, if I ran a quarter of a mile, I waited fucking couple of hours. It haunt me, bother me. I tried to run a half mile. Next time, same day, you can do more than this. If I had to walk out and walk, it just became just a process of grinding and grinding and grinding.

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       Not even a good word for it. It's not even a good word for it and just just going further and further and then when I got through running, I go to the bike, I go to the pool. If I got tired somewhere and my legs were tired, I go to the gym and I developed this crazy workout where I was doing volume like two, 300 reps of like very lightweight. People are saying how, you know, how come you don't have any loose skin? My workout routine in the gym became sick. It became sick. I was just doing two, 300 reps, 400 reps on my chest, just like for one simple exercise, the best press and a racket. Get back on it. Just rep it out. Trying to burn as many calories. I can't build that muscle mass and I just became. Just became obsessed with it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       So when you're doing this, are you at all about repetitive stress injuries or the fact that your body's not conditioned for this and you're basically taking your body? Were you abused it and now you're forcing it to live? Like in an elite athlete? I didn't care. I didn't know any better. I didn't think about it. Wow. I didn't, I, I didn't know that. Working out that harbor. Fuck you up. I did it. Fuck you up. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's one reason why I went through three hell weeks. So don't talk about a lot. But um, the stress of my life getting to 24 caused me have some serious. So as it's used, I know anything about this shit too. So as muscles, what we use as your hip flexor muscle and basically under stress it starts to tighten up. And I wish I stuttered for, from the time I was in third grade time I was in seventh grade.

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       White blotches on my skin. I was just, I was a nutcase. And so the insides of me or are also getting fucked up. So in this process, um, my psoas muscle got real tight to my [inaudible]. I can show you the bumper in the back of my head after this show's over. But I had, I started going this fucking like large tumor looking bumper in the back of my head from my body compressing. So I'm six foot one, but my muscles were like five foot nine because I just started just the muscle tightness for my solo as go into my t 12 hours, just getting tighter. My quads, everything, getting tired from distress to stress in my life. So the more I stress my body with the workouts, my lower body became out of balance. So I had a bunch of stress fractures, bunch of injuries going through buds.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       And how I got through buds was they gave me my third time was my last time going through hell week. I basically put a black sock on at 4:00 in the morning and I would get duct tape. I had at numerous stress fractures on both of my legs because my kid, my body was literally like coming in on itself and my legs were like I was. I was protonating really bad and putting stress on my stress on my shins. And so I would put duct tape, duct taped my feet and I will show you. The top of them will have pressure ulcers that were the size of quarters from, you know, how the ankle joint. So the foot goes to the Shin and how you move this, where the tape was so tight, it just created a nice ulcer right there. And um, I just, uh, just kept going through it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:59       So you just use that tape to just support your ankles. Right. So I basically kept myself and for the first 30, 45 minutes, the pain was excruciating, but then it would go numb and I would go numb and then that's how I got through. Wow. Do any longterm damage? Oh yeah. I've been out for five years, so I retired from the 21 years in the military at the time in the air force. And I did about 16 years in the navy. How old are you? Forty three. Seems like you're 30. That's good. That's good. And you really, you look very young for your age. Whenever I'm stressed I get after I fixed, I fixed was ever bothering me. So I, um, basically over the last five years, everything I've done in my life, I did it being very unhealthy. I, I'd never talked about it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:45       I just kept going and it costs me pretty much. I was choking my insides out adrenal issues, tons of the general issues, thyroid issues, anything with inner consistent, pretty much shut down on me. Um, my organs were pretty much shutting down and I went from a guy who could run 200, five miles to guy who couldn't get out of bed and the doctors were trying to search what was wrong. That's what I figured out the soda as muscle. No one had figured it out and I hit it by accident. So I've, I've missed two days of stretching out in five years. And so what happened was all the Shit I did to myself, the stress I was under, her physical, mental, all kinds of shit. It just choked me out from the inside. And doctors put me all kind of medication and the medication started doing the exact opposite of what kind of shirt I was on.

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       Um, Dah da. I was on some different things too for my estrogen, different things for my, um, I was on anything to do with your, like with your endocrine system of thyroid medicine. I'm good. God, I was on quarters. All kinds of shit to get my stuff and I like this lump in my throat from like the heart was always. I couldn't run down the street. My body was just jacked up, couldn't sleep. My whole body was just shutting down. I could give you a lot more than that, but just give an example. I was fucking dying and so I couldn't do anything. I went from a guy who is this God, you're a guy who can't do shit. And Dr. Like I don't know what's wrong with you man. You know your labs, your. This is what ptsd is it, what's going on? I knew what any of that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:34:17       So I sat in the bed one day and I realized, man, my life is over. This is it. But it gave me time to reflect on everything I had accomplished because I'd never taken time to reflect on the kid. I was the man I am now. So honestly the time I wasn't working out, it was the best time of my life because I got a chance to really reflect back and be proud of who I became. I never took time to do that. It was like one after another, get the fuck after, get after it after you ain't good enough. Motherfucker get after it, get after it. And um, I got halted. So anyway, and this process went on for a while, more medication. This isn't working, that's not working. No doctor can figure it out. I'm like, fuck it. I saw this dark about eight years before this happened and he was like, hey man, you're so fucking tight.

Speaker 1:          00:35:03       I've never seen anybody in my life as tight as you. You need 50,000 hours of stress. And he used throughout some crazy number. I was like, whatever, stretching, you know, stretching stress is bad for you. So you thought stretch was bad. I was just baffled that I read some article, you know, I know man. Fucking fuck stretching man. You know, I worked out so hard. I'd have time to stress, man. I was, I was running about 150 miles a week. I was back in the mouse. I was getting after it, man. I was working a full time job and I'm stretching and doing that. So my body was literally getting tighter and tighter just from what I was doing about this. Because you ran this. No, I wasn't that man. And so I said, no, I'm going to try and stretch out so I don't do anything for like 10 minutes or you know, don't do the six minute abs bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:35:50       So I started stressing out one hour, hour and a half. Long story short, man, I shaved my head almost every morning and that bump does on the back of my fucking head. I started realizing it was shrinking for some fucking reason. I don't know why because I shaved my head back and I was like, it's getting smaller. It's more that bump got healthier. I got smarter. That bump guy was like, oh, hold up motherfucker. But with what's going on that. So whereas most of us started getting more and more stressed out, more and more relaxed and over a period of five years from the best shape of my damn life right now from stretching out, wow. That's all it was. I went from like, I can't even count the medications I was on. Now I'm on a very low dose thyroid pill, period. Do you ever do yoga all the time, man.

Speaker 1:          00:36:34       All the time. And I, I, if I were to tell somebody one thing right now, man, that's so as muscle and getting that hip flexor opened up because we're all stressed the fuck out. It was much worse than others. It changed my life. Yeah. Um, how do you say nick? Regardless, how do you say his last name? The a Brazilian jujitsu black belt from England Greek fellow. He has a great quote about yoga. He said Yoga is a martial art you do against yourself. Yup. It's a great way of putting it. One hundred percent. So it feels like when you're in there, right? One hundred percent. And so you. How many years ago was, this was five years ago. And how long was there a period where you couldn't work out at all? There was about. So I always try to do something but I couldn't run. I could run maybe half a mile and all that shit would happen and my heart would get a fib and all kinds of stuff would happen and I started just stretching and also I try to do pull ups every now and then.

Speaker 1:          00:37:33       But everything was just. I didn't have the energy, I didn't have anything. I mean, nothing was processed in right for me. So do you think that you've just broken your body? You pushed it too hard? One hundred percent. I, I sat back in that bed that night and I had a lot of time to reflect and say, you know what? I was actually kind of proud of myself in a very sick, twisted way. I, I, even though people will understand it, I had to do what I had to do and you know, and I did it. Like I didn't tell you how I got into ultra running, you know, there's a lot of things that. So I, I pushed extremely hard. I went way beyond what I thought was capable. Like my first ultra race I did, I was a, I was heavier, I was in Iraq, you know, the markets have trail, lone survivor.

Speaker 1:          00:38:18       I was in buds, I was in three hell weeks as you know, as I said many times and I knew a lot of guys that died in the operation. I was at free fall school with mark in the trail. Who's his twin brother during the operation where wings, where Marketo was the only survivor I knew marcus trowel and I was about 200 some odd pounds and I didn't run Harley all at this time. I was a seal, but I was like a bodybuilder and I did an elliptical trainer 20 minutes on Sunday. That's all I did. So I. Did I fuck that cardio stuff? I was never about it until this happened. So that happened and I was like, man, I got find a way to raise money for these families. So I googled the, I found the foundation, Special Operations Warrior Foundation, and I googled the 10 hardest races in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:39:03       I knew nothing about ultra running the first I'd ever run with 20 miles at one time and so what came up was the badwater 1:45 and 35 mile run through death valley in the summertime. I thought it was a fucking stage race. I didn't know people could run to her and 35 miles at one time had no idea was even possibly in a stage race where you run like 20 miles. Oh, camp out and then run 20 more until you get her 35 miles. Right. So I want an ultra runner to know ultra runner was. I called the race director of Chris Cosmin of the bad water and he said, are you an ultra runner? And I was like, I don't know what that is. He goes, have you run 100 miles in 24 hours or less? I was like, no, but I said, I'm a navy seal.

Speaker 1:          00:39:43       I was in three hell weeks. I was arranged. I gave him some resume. He didn't give a shit. He said, I don't care. You got qualified for my race. And the deadline was up in two months for this badwater race and basically he said there's two more races you can do to qualify and I might consider you my race. We select top 90 athletes in the world and not even ultra runner, but I liked your cost like what you're doing. He said, uh, I call him up on a Wednesday and he goes, there's a race on Saturday in San Diego, San Diego one day when you went to run a one mile track for 24 hours, send miles. You get, you get 124 hours. I will consider you in my race. I did the math is 14, seven minute mile. Fuck it. I can do that dumb shit thinking I'll tell you that right now.

Speaker 1:          00:40:27       It was rough. Verse Pain I've been in my entire life was this race. So I have my wife at the time, she's now my ex wife. We go to Walmart, get a blue lawn chair. Which crackers in mild plex. That's what I'm gonna have for 100 mile run. So, so, but the start line, this race, it was an Aua national championships. It's like the best ultra runners compete against each other to Sydney Mazda and get 24 hours and I'm this big bodybuilder looking guy. But back then I would say I was at least 2:30 at least it made them more than jacked. Yeah. Yeah. I was ripped to fuck up. I was a big old chest out there. I was, I was jacked up. It was a picture of me. He definitely didn't look like someone who could run a hundred miles. No, not at all. So basically I started running and I get to about mile 40 mile 50 and I'm feeling pretty good.

Speaker 1:          00:41:19       I get to mile 70 and it was the worst pain in my life. I sat down and this blue lawn chair at mile 70 and my, the Ritz crackers after mile 20 became rich. Cracker balls wouldn't hydrate and correct it. I didn't know what to do. I was drinking mile plex from our nutrition because I couldn't eat these risks. Crackers have very minimal water, if any at all. And I was just dying. So I sat down this blue launch air as I was watching these windows go around in a circle that was all dizzy and lightheaded, hadn't gone to the bathroom. It's been about 12 hours. I'm at 70 miles, about 12 hours, which is good. And looked at my ex wife now and I was like, I am fucked. I started seeing like three of her and once my body stopped, my mind just went off and had to go to the bathroom and the bathroom was like, it was like 20 feet away from me if that.

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       And I couldn't. And so I sat there and pee blood down my leg and started crapping up my back and we're 30 miles to go. I and my feet were broken. I was just in the worst shape once you stopped running. Not running like that. I mean I didn't run it almost a year. I was just doing bodybuilding stuff and 20 minutes on the elliptical trainer. No running at all. I probably ran no shit, no shit, no more than 50 miles the whole year. That wasn't my thing. I want it to be like Jack, you know, I didn't want to be cardio guy. I wanted to be ripped big navy seal guy and I'm in the day before this race is funny. This guy named Joe Burns who put me through my hell week's a seal guy. He's one of the hardest guys out there. He was in the gym the Friday before I do this race and he was doing a full body squats, deadlifts, power cleans.

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       Said fuck it, man. I don't know he, he's a guy that approved me to do this race. He knew he, he, you know, he gave me the approval to go do this race and signed off on it. So I'm in the gym. I went in there, did a full body hardcore squats, dead lifts and everything with this guy because I knew he was going to come watch me in this race. So I've always been about art, man, you're going to see me come in here and Jack this weight and the memorial watched me do 100 mile run where you can think about that. So basically I paid for it. So he came out there with my favorite thing, chocolate, you know, mini donuts because he knew my story of my past life and bought six mini donuts out there and I'll have my hat pulled down and at mile 70 man it was torturous and with blood down my leg and 30 miles to go, I, uh, started reaching and cookie jars.

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       Man, I started pulling off all kinds of stuff. I reached in my mind and a lot of us when we have bad times in life, even the hardest person where we forget how bad ass we are during that hard time. I have a thing where I take a couple of seconds to reflect on our. Hang on, man. You've been through this, you've been through that. You overcame this, overcame that. I don't ever close my mind to the fact that this can be done. And I knew I had to get up and eat nutrition and hydration. I need to get it stopped being dizzy. So that's the first thing I did. I didn't panic on. I had 30 more miles to go to get 100. I started the process slowly but surely I was able to stand up and I was literally hobbling around this track with just walking, no running at all.

Speaker 1:          00:44:34       I couldn't run. My feet were in the worst pain, worst pain I've been in my entire life. Nothing in any training is even comparable to this last 30 miles, and what happened was my ex wife looked at me and she's like, man, we agreed I'm not going to make the time. I was going way too slow and at that time at mile 81, something clicked that I'll never probably be able to do again. When my mind, body, Spirit, soul, everything is connected in my mind knew I wasn't fucking around anymore and knew I wasn't going to quit and knew that guy was dead and buried and gone and I was going to die out here on his fucking Walmart for whatever reason why I was going to get through this motherfucker. I don't give a damn. It made no. There was no fucking crowds. There's no trophy.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       At the end there was. I wasn't even in a race. In my mind. There was. It was nothing. It wasn't about nothing. There was no nothing. It was a bunch of people didn't know who the fuck I was. It was me against me and I used all these different dark places to start bringing out light and just fucking go in deeper and deeper in it. The next 20 miles I ran 101 miles and I ran the next 20 miles, ran and about 10:30 pace and I did 101 miles in 18 hours and 56 minutes sat back down that Blue Porta potty. Now my chair, that guy from Walmart and that's when the body realized I was done and this great feeling came over me, but also the worst pain in my life. That's when I took a humongous shit on myself. Literally like I like a fucking log up my fucking back pissed so much plugged them in.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       My wife was, she was a nurse and she was freaked out. I couldn't get up. I couldn't stand up. She backed this camry on the knoll of the grassy areas that, and we were both lifters at the time, so she was decently strong. I put my arms around her neck, she got into the backseat of the car, left the windows down, no like horrible shit, and I had this poncho liner because it's November in San Diego, so I'm sitting her jack him back in his car and she was terrified. I need to get your doctor and you take it. The doctor says take me home. So we lived in a second story or, or the second deck of this apartment complex in San Diego. I got to the first deck so I, I get a car and I can stand up, but, but with my arms around her neck, so I just leaned down.

Speaker 1:          00:46:53       I was gonna pass out, got to the SEC, or I got to the first deck, went down, just couldn't stand up anymore. Got to run her neck, worked my way up the railing. Government dominoes on her neck again. Walked to the kitchen area, which is right in the front door. I was laying on the Poncho liner. Crap was everywhere. I managed. She helped me managed to get into the toe, into the tub, and it was like dirt was coming on my penis. This looked horrible. It's just a gross thing. The world is the worst pain I can ever, ever, ever be in in my life. And the craziest thing I'd tell you the story because right now I'm not sadistic. I'm not crazy. People may think that they may want to put a title on me after hearing me because it makes them feel better because he thinks, wow, this guy must be some special artist.

Speaker 1:          00:47:38       Fucked up crazy dude. No, I'm a guy that came from nothing. Anybody's capable of doing shit like this. Anybody and I sat in that tub. She put the water on me. She called my mom up and my mom was dating a doctor at the time. The doctor, the doctor said, you need to get him to a hospital now. She came back and all I want to do is call Chris cost on the phone, the race director, Bob Waters. I fucking did it. So she said, I'm taking to the doctor. I said, no, let me sit here and enjoy this pain. She said, what are you talking about? I said, you know, I go, I need to go to the doctor. I realized that, but I never thought it was humanly possible to do what I did. I went 70 miles at 70 miles. I was dead.

Speaker 1:          00:48:23       I was at 100 percent what? I thought what I thought was 100 percent. I went 30, 31 more miles after being in the worst physical shape I've ever been in my life. It all the, all that pain and suffering and thing was going through my fucking body and I sat in that tub and and the wires hit me. It was the most amazing feeling of accomplishment and I want to be numb. I want people to give me drugs and the and the numbness, fucking paint. I want it to. I did this over and as crazy as it sounds, it was the most amazing moment of my entire life to overcome such to come from this kid who was ms dot Lee himself and was tortured to this kid, to this guy. Now who is able to overcome such amazing odds and obstacles, and I called Chris costs the race director of bad water and he said the idea of a 24 hour races to run 24 hours, you only ran 19 a put doubt in my mind that he would let me know badwater.

Speaker 1:          00:49:26       So a month later or so, a month and a half later, I went to this race called the hurt 100. So how is it my race in Hawaii? Twenty 6,000 feet of climbing was. Ali said, that's all I said. That's so crazy. I mean he, he's a hardcore dude, but he didn't know how fucked up I was. Right? And he said, he didn't say, well, you know, he, he didn't say no, I'm not gonna let you in. He put enough doubt in my mind and say, man, I got to do more. So I was broken. I was broken bad. And like, how long did it take you to recover physically? The funniest thing about this, I tell a story very often I'd signed up for that. I'm getting to that answer is right now. I went into employment and me and my wife, my mom signed up for the first Los Vegas marathon down the Strip of Las Vegas and that incident happened.

Speaker 1:          00:50:15       So I ran a hundred miles before I ran a marathon. Two weeks later, roughly December fifth was this marathon that we all signed up for. I couldn't walk. I could not walk. I was fucked up. So 10 days or two weeks after this 100 mile in one race, I did um, this marathon, December fifth in Las Vegas. I said, you know, it's the first one I can't run. Maybe I can walk with my mom. So I try to go out to this little knoll around our grassy area in San Diego. Try. I tried to run laser broken. I said, fuck, I can't even. I'm jacked, can't do shit. So I said, you know what, maybe I'll watch you guys do the marathon and I'll cheer you guys on whatever. I said, I'll try to walk with my mom. December fifth happened. That gun went off 2005, 14 days after I broke myself off and I qualified for the Boston Marathon. I ran a three. Oh eight.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       That's crazy. And what's funny about it know people hearsay's motherfucker. Even when I tell you the story I dropped. I want to drop so many names. Google it. Look it up. I don't give a fuck. Like elmo. Seems like I'm making my own story up. It does. It almost seems like a to you. It does. Like, like when I tell if I were to hear somebody, like I said, listen, you listen to Joe Rogan's podcast. I heard some black dude from fucking Brazilian and talking about uh, this happened, this happened three weeks. Ranger school ran a hundred miles, broke my feet, brought my body about this is the biggest fucking liar on the planet or ain't nobody doing shit. He said, even when I tell my story, it almost sounds like some made up shit. So you got crazies. You ran a hundred miles before you ever ran a marathon.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       Right? Then you didn't run again at all and he's still qualified for the Boston Marathon. So you ran a three. Oh, eight, right. For the first marathon you ever did, ever did two weeks after you ran 100 miles with no training and nothing in between, but it gets better than that. You can see my training log that actually posted up. So that's when I started training for the hurt 100. So basically what happened was after that I had about four weeks. What does it feel like to run that three? Oh eight. If you could barely walk when that gun went off something off in my head and I didn't feel that much pain at all afterwards. I did, but something happened where I was like, the gun went off and that thing came back like, all right man, what if. Because I wanted to qualify for Boston, that was my goal, but I was, I was jacked up, you know, and I, and I, and I didn't run as much as I should have had all over my Iraq training.

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       I hit the weights and but my job, but my goal was when I signed up for it a year early, I want to qualify for Boston, which was a three, 10, 59 and I was like, what if you can qualify for Boston, maybe just reading so we will help me out. I spent 101 miles. What the fuck is 26 miles to me now? So the mindset going into it was like I ran 75 more miles in this so I use it to my advantage. So after that happened I ran a feet pretty much broken out. I will go to the physical therapist and they had this compression tape, compression tape help because my feet were pretty bad off and I would run 70, 8,000 mile weeks and then I went to the hurt 100 race in Hawaii. Twenty 6,000 feet of climbing over 100 miles.

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       Probably one of the top five hardest hundred mile races in the world. I wouldn't even have a real runner. Yeah. I baked a lot of miles by the last, the last two and a half. About two months that wasn't a runner with out there and got through the race, didn't 33 hours, was the ninth place finisher. Not many people finished that that year and I qualify for badwater and got in and I went on to lose weight and train hard and I got fifth my first year and went back my second year and got third. When you see you, when you lost weight, like what will you eventually when? So I went to the race about one 97, lost quite a bit from the bodybuilding time. That's over a short period of time, right? How did you lose all that way? Once again, I just worked out hard. I stopped taking my protein so much.

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       I got off, I was on this stuff, caught a nitrile tech and I got all the protein stuff. I just started. I started hitting the weight so hard and I just became a running fool. Became the black forest gump man. Pretty much. Pretty simple, man. That's what happened. Now when you say you were using compression tape on your feet and your feet with Jack Dot, what was the extent of the injuries? So basically because of my pronation, I never figured out because my muscles, um, I always had issues with stress fractures, Shin splints. So I put a lot of pressure on the inside of my ankles. And so that there's a tendon that goes up the backside of your, I don't know if it's just your fibia a backside that, that little bone back side of your foot. It goes right up beside of that law rather than inside that bone.

Speaker 1:          00:55:24       And that thing was just so fluid up on both sides that even this flexing, my foot was just killing me. So I realized when you can, when you cast that thing up, Kathy, my feet always helped me out because it, it, it locked my foot into position that would've made me protonate as much. So between the caffeine of that, and if, if he wants the badwater video of 2006, you'll see me crossing the finish line with this compression tape. Literally like flying on my ankles because I went to the race with compression tape on my ankles and so basically I'd have that on my, on my ankles. I had inserts in my, in my shoes and also this wedge on the back heel of my left foot so then it would keep me from eating that heal so much. So I had all that on just to go run and I ran my ass off and went to badwater 2006 and with a compression tape on my feet and walked a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       But I got third place. Do you always run with regular running shoes? I do, yeah. So now I don't have those issues anymore. All this stretching has opened my body up to where you know how it should've been. So my alignment is pretty good. It's not perfect. So now I just run a regular running shoes now. Now no more compression tape number and all that stuff. So if you see now if you look down there, you'll see the compressed it and you'll see my ex wife here in a second taking their can present tape off of me. She's doing it right now to see her right now. She said tape, you know. So that's the tape right there. It had to wear everyday of my life to run. So as you see this story may be kind of unbelievable, but there some proof right there.

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       So that's how it was. So painful. Yeah, I was pretty fucked up as you see right now. I'm trying to get all mad. Yeah. I'm, I'm pretty destroyed right there. What is the most amount of miles you've ever run at one time? Yeah. Two hundred and five and 39 hours. Nonstop. Woo. Yeah. I've had quite a few people on or met quite a few people now over the last year or so that have run ultras. Courtney Dot Walter. You know, she. Is She wanting to Moab? Yeah, I heard about already rather than heard about it. Yeah. She uh, she beat all the men by 22 miles. Something like that. Some crazy thing. She was first place winner. She beat everybody else a second place. One road. And with her, I mean he would never believe it when you talked to her. She seems so normal. She drinks beer and eating. Nachos needs candace ultra runner.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       Man. She's just silly and she's fun and does no demon there. Like waiting to meet a demon, you know, I'm like, where's your demon? Right. Like how are you getting through her demons? A quiet demon. It's, it's there. It has to be. There's something, there has to be. There's no other people to everybody. I know that, that can do that as a demon. A lot of us don't want to admit to shit. Yeah, we got them. Oh 100 percent. It has to be. So when you do this and you qualify and you, you do that race in Hawaii, right? They just let you in after that. No. So the race in Hawaii? Yeah. I actually called the race director up and there wasn't like a big time. Like I didn't have 100 mile race. I believe it's. I had and see the 100 mile. You did the Boston marathon or you did the Vegas Marathon?

Speaker 1:          00:58:42       Yeah. So I did a hundred miles. 100 more miles. The Vegas Marathon with the hurt 100. Did that hundred miler and all this is in a very short amount of time. Yeah. So November was the first 100 miler. December was the 26 miles in Las Vegas. January was the next hundred miler in Hawaii. You know, fucking crazy. That is like say if I was your friend and I called you up on October 20th. I go, hey man, how many times do you run? I run every now and they sent him crazy. I know if you can pull it up or not, but if you could pull up my race schedule for 2007, just pull up David Goggins race results. You can see something real crazy. And second they say this is good. I gotta show you proof because why? I know my story doesn't make any but this. Look at the dates of these races and we're going to show it to you in a second.

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       It's, I'm just look at the hundred miles. Fifty miles back to back weekends. How many weekends there were between races. So if you look right here, you can't really see it. So we've looked at 2007. Yeah, go all the way down. Keep on going and telling $70. Racist there too. That. Okay, get right there. So hundred miler, Hawaii. Oh Geez. Look up first. Uh, two weeks later, three weeks later, another one that's 50 miler, 50 miler, um, a month later you're looking at what? Fourteen days later, another 50 k 50 miler. A month later they look at less than a month. Another 50 miler, 50 miler in June. July was another hundred. Miler. Badwater was literally bad one. It was a month after I did that 100 miler. One hundred 35. Our leadville was less than a month after badwater. They're playing 100 was three weeks after leadville. Um, Angel's crest was to attend date a week after that 100 miler, the bear 100 was a what?

Speaker 1:          01:00:29       Thirteen days after that 100 milers. She and then I ran the 200 and it said two and three point five, but I didn't ran towards his tour and five miles around there. But what's not in there was that mcnaughton race I did in 2,850 mile race. Also did in 2007 that wasn't listed. So that was just my 2007 year. That's insane. Yeah. So do you think that is what fucked your body up? No, no, no, because I still run the same mileage now. We're fucked my body up as hell week. Really? Oh yeah. You don't go through three hell weeks in one year. So I. So what happened was when I realized that my body was really jacked up, which I went, I was a big time squatter, love squatting, and I went through the first hell week, got messed up. Second Hook I got all the way through.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       Then third, hope we could get all the way through. And my third hell week we hit. We had a guy die on Thursday and then that whole weekend and I graduated 100 done pulmonary edema. It was a code name was John Scopp Code is fuck hell week. The Pacific Ocean's never warm and it rained the whole time. The whole time was rain and he, um, pretty much just drown in his own fluids. Pretty much. We were in the pool doing some evolution. He sunk to the bottom, um, his temperature was hot. He, he missed a lot of hell week for getting pulled out for different stuff. He wouldn't quit and um, he ended up dying and he'll wait. But um, yeah, so anyway, after hell week ended, um, I want to go back to the gym, you know, second phase happened, die phase, like I could get back in the gym, start jacking my weight.

Speaker 1:          01:02:00       I Love Jack and wait. And I realized I couldn't squat. So I went from squatting a lot too. I couldn't even squat the bar because my lower back was all fucked up and I was like, I don't know what's going on. It was because there's this muscle so it hell week your hip flexors are. So I went through so many of them so fast and so the hardest part of buds I went through three times, not, not the hell week part, one of the hardest parts, but it was the initial part of the where everybody sees on tv, the log pt to Surf, torture the Dag on boats over your head, law, all that shit. I went through that person three times in one year and um, over a period of time my hip flexors got so tight that is jack me up a jack me up from my hip flexors, so always been so cold and so stressed out and everything led up to it.

Speaker 1:          01:02:50       But this really was the part that I noticed I could squat before hell week or before my first time going to bud's after, after Bud's, I couldn't, I couldn't squat anymore. Do you just think it might just be because your body was exhausted? No, because I, I for 12 years, so I would go back and tough it out. Like, like with Joe Burns, he was squatting. So I said, fuck, I'm going to squat with Joe Burns, but I just couldn't squat because that, that muscle was attached to your t 12. So what was it doing to. Is it locking up? There was, this is just pulling. So it made my hips feel like I couldn't sync my ass. I couldn't think. So it's, it's incredible pain. And then with the weight pushing me down and then try to push up, the pain was just too much. So it was, oh, this is all range of motion.

Speaker 1:          01:03:36       Range of motion issues. Yeah. Wow. That's an important thing for my friend. Cam Haynes, who doesn't stretch? He's another friend of mine who runs ultra races. He ran that Moab to 40. He's run the big foot two. Oh, five is when a few of those. Right? Um, I know he's listening. Go stretch dude. He has support, man. It was. Especially if you're working that hard, right? If you're doing that much. Yeah. You're, you're definitely locking up. He could barely touch his toes. Yeah. That's not a good thing. That's not good. No, no, no. It comes back to her chin inside pretty soon. Now. How flexible you now, because I would imagine you probably a fucking ballerina at this point because it's sad when your brain. I'm trying to get there. I'm trying to get there. So I stretch every night for these two hours. This is the thing that people said that it'll always pissed me off because I'm pretty flexible.

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       They said, oh, well, you're naturally flexible. People have a natural threshold. Like, no, they don't. Like a doctor told me that. I go, you don't know what you're talking about. I'm like, you don't know what you're talking about because most people don't push themselves past that pain, that stretch pain, right. People want to put a title on your man. It's easier for them. Just fucking natural. Natural. Exactly. Now you don't work hard enough, motherfucker. Yeah. People don't like. Champs aren't usually flexible. You have to, you have to force yourself to do this. Right. And uh, I know it because I had a friend, my friend tom or dog now, he was a football player, Jack, big thick dude. Terrible flexibility was taking taekwondo with me. And over the course of a couple of years I saw that dude eventually develop a full split and you go. And he just did it through his mind. He just was. Everybody else was done training. That guy would be on the mat constantly stretch and always working out because he had built his body up so strong all those years of squatting and lifting that he just, you know, he was all tents and everything was just like this super powerful. Right. But all like very tense. That's why I stopped. That's what I never stretched

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       because I wanted to strength. Yeah. You weren't that tight muscle, but. No, I don't think it stupid. Yeah. I think you're not supposed to stretch before you do big physical activities because I think it does like we can use somewhat, but I don't think being flexible overall makes you weak or not at all. Not at all. What certainly doesn't from martial arts, because you need that flexibility to have leg dexterity to be able to kick. It's got to be fluid where it's not tightened up by restriction of the motion of your body. I get it. It's truth. I just think people are, for whatever reason, and A. I'm one of those. I drone on too much about yoga. I'm like one of those vegans. It's like you gotta do it man. I get annoying like a born again Christian or something. It's like I'm getting that way now, man.

Speaker 2:          01:06:00       I'm getting that way now for anybody who does anything to hard. Like you know, if you do anything like with weight lifting type shit or martial arts type shit where it's just everything's explosion. It's lifting, it's heavy, it's push, push, push yoga to balance your shit out and we'll, yeah, we'll really. Well man and this all these people that resist it. Like there was some article recently that was something along the lines of hot yoga is just trendy nonsense. I read that and then even in the article it talked about that there might be some benefits in terms of like the strengthening your arteries and they didn't even mention heat shock proteins is a study going on right now. I believe it's at Harvard. One of my friends was telling me about it where they're. They're trying to find the benefits of 90 minute hot yoga classes because they think it might mirror the observed benefits of sauna which they already know for a fact has big benefits because of your body producing heat shock proteins.

Speaker 2:          01:06:57       To deal with the heat. That's why I put that song in here, man. I go in that fuck her all the time, but no one can tell me it doesn't work. It's big. It's proof positive. That changed my life. It wasn't a medication or this or address. It was stretching. Yeah, it was yoga, stretching. All that stuff combined changed it, but I just think it balances out your body in those static poses where you're just holding the pose and it just works you out in a weird way. They to percent. You just don't get lifting weights or hitting the bag or anything. You're just not going to get that. That kind of working out. I can't agree with you more. It's so difficult. It's crazy. Get your ass off. You're enjoying housewives and shit and be like, this is like the silent struggle. It's humbling it.

Speaker 2:          01:07:36       Nobody knows. If you see like two doorways, right? And one of them is like fucking ct Ali Fletcher's fucking super pumped iron addicts gym, which is hard work and then right next to it is the yoga studio. You're like, well, once you get done with all that hard work, you'll go over to that yoga studio. No, there's two different kinds of hard work going on. It's no joke. Two different kinds of hard work. Yes sir. So what do you do now in terms of like you got over this five years ago, you're in this bad situation where your body's not working right now. Everything's working great again. Well, I had two heart surgeries also. Whoa. So

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       your heart. So I had a hole in it so you know, you're not supposed to have a hole in your heart and be a ceo and it would be born with it. I was born with it. It went undetected and me pushing so hard. So in 2009 I was training for this race across America and um, I, I just couldn't go anymore. Another pitfall in my life was the whole. And I was pretty much off active duty seal for three years. Then I had to harsh with them trying to fix it. So the whole was significantly large account, big it. They say it was big as a quarter and I'm like, how the hell is big as a quarter? Yeah, that's a pretty big hole in your heart because they had to helix patches. I'm like, that's impossible that the helix patches there in my heart.

Speaker 1:          01:08:56       So the two stents, what is a helix patch? It is like a, a little Mesh. Very like what they do for Hernias. Like something like maybe something like that. So they were in my artery and they placed this patch. But to go through your artery? Yeah, they went through my for more artery with a camera? Yeah, with the other cameras down through my throat. Whoa. And they put this catheter through my artery that went to my heart. They, they went and they took this helix patched that. They placed it in there and then they found out six months later at the whole wasn't covered up enough yet because a whole, the, the patch was very damn big hit. So they put on and they go back in there in 2010. How's the patches adhere to your heart? I guess your heart heals around the patch.

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       So. But how did they stick it in place? I guess they put it with the holes that and then it Kinda like inflates. Oh Wow. The whole is at. And then that thing goes in there and then it kinda covers a whole. And then the heart. So there's two things in my heart right now that the heart kind of covered up. Whoa. Okay. So here's the job. Go. Jamie's got a, an image of it for us. Whoa. So it's attached to this little probe. Right? And then they put it over the area where the injury is. Wow, that's insane. Yeah. Atrial septum defect was, I had atrial septal defect. So basically everything I had done I got from Madison. Oh Shit. It's crazy. I'll be done. That's so crazy that they could do that. Yeah. So I was out for um, I was off activity for three years, so I stuck.

Speaker 1:          01:10:30       I was in the recruiting area for three years trying to get back on active duty and that's, that was my life for three years. So they put that patch in. Yup. And now your heart. One hundred percent. It's 100 percent. One hundred percent. Wow. Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah. I was losing blood and I was just. I was a bad off. Which is amazing that you were able to do all that with a hole in your heart. That's what the doctors were saying, you know, because they ain't know I was a seal. So I went in and the doctor that found the whole are, he gave me ekg is all this stuff. Once again man, you as after I ran like 200, five miles, you know, they made you're in great shape. I'm like, man, I just don't feel good. Like walking up the stairs is making me jacked up. So Dr Doc Shrek, he's like, you know, gave me Ekg, can go to the doctor, get an echocardiogram. So I'm in there getting echocardiogram just chilling out in there and the guy's talking to me, he has his little one and my heart were bullshitting the boss stuff and he, when people get quiet, fucking not good man. So He's in there. This head is one of my heart chilling out. Yeah man, what are you doing? Hey, what's going on?

Speaker 1:          01:11:40       Like. And he says, I'll be right back. He goes and gets a doctor. Dr Comes in, puts things on my heart, the doctor gets another doctor now. I'm just freaking the fuck out. I'm like, okay, cause when it comes to your heart, when that was a big deal. So they come back in and said, hey, we can stop the echocardiogram when he talked to yet in the hallway, you have a hole in your heart. And the guy didn't know that I was, he knew I was a navy guy, but I think he was a ceo because not many black guys are seals. And he had a conversation about, you know, we got fix this real quick. I said, yeah, I mean then I came up, I was the seal. He said, man, you could've died jumping, you can die diving, you could have died and all this stuff because basically the hole in your heart, if it gets plugged with something, like anything like, you know, let's say you get a bubble from diving or something like that, you gonna die, right?

Speaker 1:          01:12:32       So I, I, I call it luck. I called look. Wow. So I uh, I got through two surgeries, they put it back on, I lost the, give you the first one, and then when did they realize that it's not good enough, so they take you back and you can get a bubble study, a bubble test. So they, so they like literally send bubbles that way, safe bubbles that way to see if the bubble goes through your heart. So they have this, this echocardiogram again and they hook you up I think to id or something like that and they throw these bubbles through your heart and they see if it goes through after six months when it should have been healed up, the bubble went through. So I had to tell me then, hey, we got gotta, you know, you're not, you're not good to go.

Speaker 1:          01:13:15       So I had to take a year before I can have another surgery because one, two, because that patch had to be completely, completely healed before they can go back in time. You knew you had a whole right? So. So they knew how to hold because of the heart surgery all the time. Like when you're waiting for a deal, you know you have an extra hole. Yes, I know. I have a whole what we're allowed to do with your body then. Well at that time they go, you know, do how you feel comfortable and so, you know, the whole is not going to kill you right now but you can't die. You can't jump. You pretty much willing to steal anymore. So I was a recruiter for a period of time. Um, so basically I was crazy about that is before my second surgery I was actually training for Delta Force.

Speaker 1:          01:14:00       I was, I wanted to go to Delta and I was rocking recruiting a lot and before my second truck running and you're running with a pack, a pack on my back with some way on how heavy the pack, 50, 60 pounds. And you run with that on. Well you're supposed to hike or hump like rock hopping, right? I ran with it because. Because, you know, that's what I did. Right? So the day before, the day of the day of heart surgery, I did a ruck run because I knew I was going to be out of commission for Awhile. So fuck it. Matter get my last one in, dude. Jesus Christ. So I could do. I have had my training log. So after my second heart surgery, all I could do was walk. So I became an ultra walker, walked my fucking ass off and I over a period of time it took a year for that thing to heal up the hill.

Speaker 1:          01:14:49       You know my first bubble study after my second heart surgery came back negative or positive, the bubble went through again. Oh No. And they're going to crack me open. Oh Man. Over that period of time, my heart healed around that thing nicely. And I passed the second bubble tests. So the first bubble test was how long after a year? It was. So the first bubble tests after the first surgery, six months. And then you had to go through a full six months after that totally heal. Then you have the second heart surgery. And when does the bubble test fail? After the second heart surgery, it was about six months, Jesus Christ, and they said, and the doctor looked at me and said, you know, I'm sorry to inform him that we get the crack your chest open the next time they're really getting there. So I sat back thinking this could be a third heart surgery, and then, um, that one, they said we have to wait for six months to see if this thing's gonna close up. Right? And I came back thinking, man, I'm about to get cracked the fuck open. And that bubble got pinned up, man. They go through, maybe forced it through with your mind and visualize and that's it, man. That's something to visualize. Holy Shit, man, that is crazy. It's crazy. One on a ruck run with a hole in your heart to. I did it for several years. I said, fuck it. I might as well keep on going, man.

Speaker 1:          01:16:05       That's amazing. Now after all said and done, everything's good now. Yeah, everything. I mean, I'm sure it must have popped up in my fucking ass and not to do that. You know, everything's good right now. I'm always waiting for the next thing to pop up and I handled the same way I was attacking, but yeah, as of right now, I'm in the best shape. My 43 years old just turned 43 February 17th. I am in the best shape of my life. I'm not knocking on wood because life. Fuck it. Life comes at you dude. Fuck. Knocking on wood. Come at me. I mean, I would think that you would be a go to guy for injuries. Like if anybody's ball game. I've had them all. I've had. When you broke the world record for Chin ups, then you rip your arm apart. Pull ups. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16:44       So if you pull up the picture, there's a picture of my hand. You'll see. I'll know what is the pull ups or pull ups or here. Hands our hands out and chin ups or hands four hands forward. So I failed three times. I failed twice before I finally got it the third time. And um, I, the first time I rip the shit out of my forearm. And then the second time you'll see there's a picture of my hand. And it is a third degree burn. So that's my hand. Oh Jesus, man, what in the fuck is going to look at you a bit by a wolf. So what's funny about that, as you see that, uh, that doesn't create after one pull up. So if you can imagine the pain of [inaudible], you know, you have one contact point I said like running, you can overcome it because he, this big giant legs.

Speaker 1:          01:17:30       And it's, it's different when you have these little fragile punk ass hands touching the bar. Imagine 4,030 pull ups. How many times you're coming on that bar coming off now at 207 pounds at the time. So I was, I was a bigger guy. I'm like one 95 or 95 now. So I was almost 22 pounds heavier. So that was a lot bigger than I am right there. Bam. You would prefer get that shit man. So you were doing it in sets of five testify. So as you see, you have these different people who are witnessing you, you have to have your, your, your number there to make sure that you're, um, you know, qualify for the guest. A world's record. That's 1415. I have a long way to governor the 4,015 pull ups to go. She's so. Yeah. And how long did you do this?

Speaker 1:          01:18:18       Over 24 hours. It was seven. So I broke it up 17. Wow. And I was fucking over it. What did it feel like in the last chin up? You know what? Actually there's a video that we have and um, I was chasing this guy named Steven Highland. So this guy named Steven Holl had the record and the video is my last three posts for a broken record. I'm talking so much shit to this motherfucker. I'm like, Hey, motherfucker thought I wasn't gonna get it. Huh? I told you bitch ass mother fucker. I'm coming after you. I'm here now. It's just me talking shit. It's a cool video. But I felt um, I felt nothing. I was just happy I have to do anymore. I just 67,000 pullups in nine months is training record for 40,000 and the failures, so I did the first time in September. Failed miserably.

Speaker 1:          01:19:07       I was the day showed the 2,588 or something like that. Failed miserably for millions of people too much later. November. Tried again, failed again. Two months later in January 19th I finally fucking got it. So after I got it, it wasn't like I'm happy. It was like I ain't got to more fucking pull ups anymore. Roger that saw it was a fucking check that have picked off man. But you were doing them when I got here today. You know why? Because now it's a part of me, dude, man, I don't like doing it so we got to get some knocks him out. You don't like doing them so you gotta do it. That's my whole life isn't like someone. Someone gets drunk at a certain whiskey. Like if they smell it, they'll get disgusted. Like it's like yeager mice or something like that. They smell it. Right? Is that what it's like with you?

Speaker 1:          01:19:53       With, with a lot of ups? With a lot of things, lot of things I don't like running on like, and people don't believe it, but you know, I was, I was a big guy twice in my life, so hence the reason why I just don't like running, man. It hurts. It's brutal. Sucks going out and I'm going to be gone for two hours or I am going to be gone 39 hours running a one mile track. Fuck, I'm not crazy, man. This sucks. I mean, you know, people put me in this category of you must be some crazy guy who loves it. Nah Man. Nah. That's why I do it though. That's the only way to couch your fucking brain man. One way to get hard and like people take these classes on mental toughness. Like even sales. You have the class about visualization, self talk, eat an elephant.

Speaker 1:          01:20:34       One bite at a time. Breathing control. Yeah. Roger, that you got to put yourself in her lacy situation. It's a lifestyle. How are you going to react? How are you going to react to it? Like all that training goes out the fucking door when you're in the fucking cold water and you're fucking miserable as the first hour of a her and 30 hours of hell week in that first wave goes over your head and you're the curtis, you've been in your life and your mind goes from our one hour, one fucking 30. Oh, that fucking self talking shit dude. You Ain't thinking about getting the fuck out of here. But if you live this shit on a daily basis and know how to calm your mind down to self talk will help. All that stuff will help. But usually we react. We have pain, we have suffered, we react and we react about get the fuck outta here.

Speaker 1:          01:21:20       We gotta go. It's those people were able to control that fucking feeling of fucking flight and say, Nah, motherfucker. There's a way through this. It's not going to be here forever. I'm not cold right now. I went through three of them. I'm not coding now. I'm in a nice warm studio with you. You've got to think about that shit. It's just gonna end. It's gonna end, but we don't know that. We don't think that at that time it could last forever and then you get to sit back on Friday. Everybody walking across the, you know, back on the grinder, all the 16, 17, 18 guys that graduated hell week and you get a chance to watch these guys victorious, and then you get the chance to think about that. You take that hot, warm shower, first name chemistry, your fucking minds. Why the fuck did I quit? So what keeps me going? I've quit several things. I know what's on the back end, the fucking quitting. It's a lifetime of thinking about why the fuck did I do that? No, I ain't fucking doing that.

Speaker 2:          01:22:13       There's something about talking to a guy like you that a lot of people hope that you're going to say some magic thing that's going to click in their brain. Everybody gets changed who they are, like, what is it? What is the thing? That's why people go to these self help conferences and they take these classes and they hope that someone's going to say something that changes the way their mind works. It's hilarious to me. It is, it's kind of Larry's to me too. But what is also hilarious is that what you're saying is that you have to do those things. You have to suffer, you have to live in it, you have to be comfortable in it. And then maybe some of that shit will help you a little bit along the way

Speaker 1:          01:22:56       period. And I went to, I was a, when I was a recruiter, I got invited to mit smart ass motherfuckers there, man, I'm not that. I'm dumb and knuckle dragger and um, there was this guy there, I forget his name, but he was like the top head head guy, old white guy, you know, all, all genius out and we were on this panel and they were asking us all these questions about the mind, mental toughness and shit. And he was answering them and I wasn't answering any questions and I'll never forget he was just answering them off of theory. He never put his fucking ass and shit. You read a bunch of fucking books and you think that you know how to fucking mind works and shit. I had gone through hill to a kid and then all the way up until now. Right. So I know.

Speaker 1:          01:23:41       So that theory is bullshit. Yeah, there's a lot of good stuff out there you can read from people, but I had lived hill and when you put yourself in hill, that's the only time you can figure out how to fuck to get through that motherfucker. You can't. You can't read somebody else's book about some theory on how to do shit. Some guy who set up and they're a nice warm office and read it and wrote some book with a Nice Cup of coffee in the fucking hair. No, I want to see that guy who put immersed himself in fucking hell. And he thought about quitting and leaving and him and his wife and his kids. And why am I here? Is this, is it worth it? All this crazy shit is still said it. Found out a way to get through it. So basically that's, that's the bottom line of it all.

Speaker 1:          01:24:27       We all want to read about how we can quickly get somewhere. That's why there's six minute abs and all this other shit. So powerful. Did you make it some results from it, but they're not permanent. The permanent result comes from you fucking. I say it all the time. You have to suffer. You have to make that a tattoo on your fucking brain. So when that time comes again, you don't forget it. You may forget it for a second, but you can go back in the cookie jar. I call it. It's a. it's something that we've all endured. I call it the cookie jar and we often forget how hard we are, but you got to reflect back to a couple of seconds. Reflect. I've been through this, I've been through that, and then remind yourself I'm a bad motherfucker and then you can get through that shit, but if you don't believe it even endorse shit.

Speaker 1:          01:25:18       You're just blowing smoke man and you're not going to get through anything. What was this guy saying like, well, what was his theories that he was thrown out? There is theories was about, I forget exactly what it was. Was it something about what the mind does under stress and how we can't. He said how we can't do something and I did it. I did what he said we couldn't do. Like, what was he saying he couldn't do. It was something about if you're born, if you're born a certain way, if somebody, if you're born a certain way, you can't become this way. It was totally saying that who I am now, like I had to be born with some genetic power or some, some gift from God, but I had to have some kind of special, had had some kind of special gift. I forget what set me off, but it was that we had to be to be somewhere you had a baby born with.

Speaker 1:          01:26:11       It was a concept and I know what I was born with and I know the battle that I had in my mind. So when he said it, I sat there looking at my face and some of the crowd asked me a question. I totally contradicted everything he said and I was like, Nah man. I mean, I know for a fact that you can be this fucked up dude like really fucked up dude and with the right mindset and it's. It sounds so easy with the right mindset doesn't sound easy to know what you're saying. It sounds very simplistic answer, right? You can. You can, but you have to go into a dark chambers that we often shut off and you got to open them up. You get to open up and fight that fucking demon getting there. Talk to that motherfucker and say, what's up?

Speaker 1:          01:26:59       And we often take the. We all like to take this four lane highway. The easy highway has has fucking signs. It has restaurants. We all loved that four lane highway. We always step over the shovel and all I did was I picked up that fucking shovel and shovel. I made my own path and you may have big boulders and shit. They may be getting towards your miles up the road faster than you, but going through this path of life, this journey over here that you make yourself, that's incredibly difficult, but comes out. The other end of that motherfucker is some glorious shit that you can't even explain to people and we're afraid. Bottom line is most of us, even the people who have all these theories and shit, it's easier to accept the fact that I'm just not good enough. I wasn't made to do that, and yes, some of us can't be Lebron James, but I'll tell you right now, man, we can do a lot of shit when it comes to this pure arm guts and willpower and getting through shit. We have a lot more with a lot more than we think we have the other

Speaker 2:          01:27:59       album with a guy like that, with his theories. His theories are based on results and those results are based on human beings and most human beings. There are certain people that are born with certain gifts, like a guy like Lebron James, obvious physical talent. You Know Jon Jones and mma. Obviously physical talent, but there's. When you look at someone who's super successful, you always assume that it has to be because of some sort of physical gifts because people look at themselves and I'm sure this doctor, this old dude probably had like a little gut and probably says exactly. I looked a little tiny arms, weak shoulders and probably thought, well, there are certain people that are just Meza morphic and probably broke it down all the scientific terms, you know, they, they, they just have a fast twitch muscle fibers and they'll say all this crazy shit that is true at the very highest levels of the winners. Right? But it doesn't mean that you can't become that. No, it just means that it's too painful for most people to go through. So very few people ever get there. So if you look at the actual results, he would be correct, but he's not correct

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       because he doesn't take the shovel. Exactly. That's the moral of the story, does not some easy lit up street lights, wrath with nice smooth roads, right? It's a difficult motherfucker where you're going to fail and you're going to be in your head. You can be saying I'm not good enough and it's how you get through that is how you get through that on a daily basis. When that thing is st man, I'm 43. I've done so much. You start to become civilized. The refrigerator gets full. You start making money and you start. I'm not getting cold anymore. I'm retired once in at 40 people. Shouldn't it be playing basketball or football or or, or being. You start to believe this shit and it becomes in your fucking mind like there's people who are retiring at 47 years old or 30 something years old at 43, I'm still putting in hundred mile weeks, still doing thousands of pullups pushups because I'm not allowing myself to become civilized.

Speaker 1:          01:29:59       The worst that can happen to a man's become civilized. You lose that fucking fight you, you, you, you, you lose that. Why the fuck am I doing this shit? I'm good. You Ain't good man. You ain't never fucking arrived and that's just my mentality. You may have more, but you'd never fucking arrived. You want to be uncommon. I must uncommon people, period. Uncommon amongst uncommon peoples. One of the greatest ways to put it, that's it. Like if you're the. If, if, if you're like, for me, what got me in trouble with the navy seals is I wanted to be one so bad, so bad. I fought my ass off and I saw them as uncommon. People. Very uncommon. But once you become a navy seal, you all navy seal. So guess what happens? Your fucking common. Again, I wanted to be uncommon and months uncommon people.

Speaker 1:          01:30:47       I want it to be the guy. I don't care if you fucking light. Okay? If you don't understand me, I didn't give a fuck. Once I went through this fucking journey and path of life, you ain't got to enter a whole bunch of fucking guys that don't fucking like me. I don't give a fuck. I'm a warrior period. There's a lot of guys are spending a lot more combat than me. A warrior's not always at words that mother fucker. He says, Hey, I'm here again today. I'm here again. Tomorrow going to be here the next day. I'm 50 years old. I'm still fucking getting after it. It's a person that puts no fucking limit on west possible and that's what got me in trouble a lot. That's why I went to ranger school as a seal. That's what I tried to go to Delta force twice. You know I, I've been, I've been through all these different training programs because I was looking for in the military where I say all is in the training.

Speaker 1:          01:31:33       These people get their ass handed to them after they get out. A lot of them get civilized. I always wanted to go back into training. Am I? We're always that. I wanted to go back to war and the war was in that training program where you see guys, you can quit. Guys who are brutal guys who are suffering, guys who are. You Go. So as a ceo you don't volunteer for ranger school. I did. I put in seven chips, got turned down by eighth grade. I got accepted. I went at 28, 29 years old and they go, why don't you go? Because I started becoming civilized. I started becoming complacent. I, I needed to get my fucking ass kicked again. And when you go as a seal going down to you have no rank and ranger school, you can be a major. You just fucking Joe Brown, you're nobody and you're not eating, you're not sleeping.

Speaker 1:          01:32:20       So I always would put myself. I really immerse myself and shit like that. Even our climb the ladder and I intentionally fall back down that motherfucker. They said, all right man, getting soft dude, getting soft. Kick your fucking ass again. And I, you know, it's kind of the process. Did you find resistance from that amongst other guys that didn't like to make the. You were making them uncomfortable because that is something that people. There's a natural instinct that people have when someone's working harder than them to somehow another diminish that person. Well, I know that a lot of guys don't mind me for a lot of reasons and I realized that I am a guy that doesn't care if you liked me or not. And when you're an Alpha male and you're against other offer males and we eat our own alpha males eat their own.

Speaker 1:          01:33:07       And I loved that shit is fucking gold man. I want to eat. Hey Man, I'm all about that kind of mentality, but I would sometimes take it to another level and I wasn't part of a of a good old boy network. I didn't want to be part. I wanted to be David fucking goggins for too long in my life. It got me in trouble for two on my left. I wanted to be accepted. Growing up. I lied. I fucking did what I could for. If you fucking like UFC and identity. I love it. I love it man. Let's go fucking watch them and be my friend. Be My buddy. That fucking weak ass shit. I found out through this path of life. Who is David Goggins? Who am I to go through all? I did it alone. There was no fucking trophy on the fucking wall.

Speaker 1:          01:33:49       The mantle that trophies in my fucking brain. No one helped me get to know me. Pay My fucking bills. No, I did shit for me. No one random. His fucking mouth was that fucking wait when I suffered on my own and develop this man who said to I man, a very competitive, ultra competitive. Do that taking what you want, man. I call that personal sovereignty. Exactly what not a lot of people that have asked me and there's a lot of people that change who they are depending upon what people want from them and that's. That's me. Yeah, that's important man. And most people struggled their whole life to find out who they are, struggled their whole, their whole life. To find out what defines them, what they actually enjoy and what they don't. You start putting yourself in situations that suck your find yourself. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:34:33       You'll find out real quick. That is the thing, right? And that's one of the things that I've gotten from paying attention to you, is that you, what you're preaching, what you're talking about is finding yourself through struggle. It's it, it's the only way to find yourself. You don't find yourself. If you'd like bench pressing and you bench press all the fucking time. What are you finding out? If you'd like to swim, that's all you want to do is swim. What are you finding out? Put that you know people always are people talking about tripled down on your fucking strikes. That's the fucking weak ass shit in the world now tripled down on your fucking weaknesses. Found out something about yourself. You know the the good shit. You know the happy shit. That's why my on my facebook page. Why don't you talk about good times?

Speaker 1:          01:35:15       You know how to get to that shit motherfucker. You don't need a fucking year. You don't need. Want to tell you how to get through. It's happy. That's easy. Shit. I, I would tell you how you can help yourself get through the times that suck real life. This is real life. Ninety percent of your life will suck. Ten percent will be fucking happy. You may be lucky guy and have a lot of fucking money. Have a great ass woman. All this shit. Trust me one on one with that fucking guy. He's missing something because life still sucks that he hasn't faced something that bothered him his whole fucking life. Some is still eating that motherfucker up. Almost everybody. Everybody eating you the fuck up, but maybe you found a good way how I did growing up on how they ignore that voice that's saying you ain't facing some shit. Period, man. I'm not special. I just stopped listing. I. I listened to that voice. It's why I talk so fucking aggressive. People said, man, do you believe in God your customer much. When I say fuck it, it's letting you know what I'm thinking. If I try to make it all pretty and shit, that's not what my life was. It was a violent, violent struggle daily to get where I'm at today. I'm not gonna water down. Knock a water down. Shit wasn't fun. It ain't fun today, but I'm happy.

Speaker 2:          01:36:37       Don't you think that your happiness is probably elevated by the amount of pain that you've gone through? One hundred percent. So the amount of suffering that you understand, the amount of pain that you've gone through makes you appreciate the happiness and the beautiful moments with much more intensity. That's what people miss about my story week. People hear this

Speaker 1:          01:36:59       kid, I'm a god. He must be miserable. Oh my God, what the Hell is wrong with them? You're missing the fucking story. You're not listening to the story, man. Look what I overcame. If that is, uh, put some badge of honor tattooed in your fucking brain for the rest of your life. You can die today talking to Joe Rogan. You're missing the story, man. Am I happy? What the fuck do you think? Don't miss it. Don't misunderstand the passion in which I speak for not being intensely happy, happiest person in the world, but I'm not done so I'm not gonna. Speak to you like, Oh man, everything is great. No, I have a lot more shit to do. A lot more shit to do.

Speaker 2:          01:37:40       Well, this is in the same use of the word that you used the warrior's mentality, the warriors life, right? This is. This is the way that you can keep balanced and sane and keep a good grip on who you are. Period. And like there's

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       a quote that was said. I don't know who said it. It was a great quote. This guy said, I'm going into combat going into war of the 100 men that go into war tensioning fucking be there. 80 of them are just targets. 10 do most or nine do most of fighting. One is a warrior and it's a true quote to life. I saw it going through train. I saw it everywhere I went. There's so many people who just show up to life that shouldn't even fucking be around and there's few people do all the work. I wanted to be part of that nine. I'm working towards being that one and that's just how I live my life now. What are you doing with your life these days? Right now I keep the same. I'm very routine. I get up every morning, I run, I go to the gym and then at nighttime I stretch out.

Speaker 1:          01:38:48       I am. I'm just trying to develop a business costing me a lot of money trying to do that. I'm just getting out. I'm A. I'm an introvert, so I never want to get on social media. I'm not big on that. I'm big on being with yourself. I believe all these fucking cameras and phones and shit, it takes you away from the most powerful thing in the world, which is your fucking mind. So I try hard to continue to grow that. I'm trying to break a record again. I'm trying to cross death valley as fast as possible. The top of Mount Whitney and I'm. I'm constantly trying to put goals in front me, but the biggest thing that I'm trying to find more of myself and the only way I can find more as to silence the world out as much as I can because it's getting busier. Everyday is getting faster and the faster it gets, the more you are missing who the fuck you are.

Speaker 1:          01:39:37       So I track my own mind a lot and say, look man, I put my phone away. I put shit away and I go dark. I go dark a lot and it's because I have to find out. I'm on a journey of life and we all have a different journey and I want to be in my fucking pine box and I believe your spirit is forever has to, to fucking powerful. No way in hell that thing is dies when you die. I want to be able to look back on my life and I'm all dead and be so fucking proud of myself forever. This is all temporary shit to me. I want to be forever proud of who I was as a man and change who I used to be. The liar, the insecure guy, the guy who can whatever I want to be proud of, and I if I died.

Speaker 1:          01:40:17       Now if I die at 80, 9,100, I want to look at myself and say, I'm proud of myself. Don't you think that also like we were saying that because you've gone through so much struggle, you appreciate happiness, true happiness. Do you think that you appreciate discipline because you weren't disciplined? Do you think you appreciate the hard work you put in because you used to be weak? Yes. I appreciate self-discipline. Yes. I never had in the crazy thing about what you say that I didn't have a motherfucker come wake me up at 3:00 in the fucking morning and say, hey, you gotta get your shit in. I had no trainer. I have a nutritionist. It was the self discipline that I had to survive, not survive. I was week to to, to, to thrive. No one said, hey man, your tour in [inaudible] 97 pounds, man, I will help you out.

Speaker 1:          01:41:02       I'll help [inaudible]. You're fucking. You're not smart. I'm going to help you out. I had to work at all this shit I had to overcome and it, it, it subdisciplines everything. If you don't have it, I don't look at you right? Because I know you're capable of more. It's not discipline so much for me. It's all on you. It's all on you. The self part. It was big. We need someone to hold people accountable. Fuck that shit man. Fuck that shit. We count on people too much to get us through shit. And we looked to our right. We look to our left and looking for help and if you can build that self, you can build that total accountability and one self and it's not about being selfish. I'm trying to create a better me. So hopefully people who are hearing this are taking it the right way, can say I can run a mile, anybody running 205 fucking miles doing fourth being and said, hey, that shit, she doesn't matter. I want you to see how fucking far you can go. And that's all it's about yourself and that's where it all comes from

Speaker 2:          01:42:09       and I guarantee you've already done that. What you experience from watching a television show and what, what got you out the door, what got you to sorta take the first steps to change your life, what you experienced by watching rocky, what you expect, those, those moments of inspiration, those are critical for people. They need to know that someone's done something, that someone's done something that's greater than they would they could imagine themselves doing and they want to take a step towards trying to be better. That that inspiration is gigantic. And sometimes it comes across as corny. You know, people read too much of it online. It becomes, it drowns out you, you lose the meaning gets lost. I mean there's. And there's a lot of, posers has, a lot of people are out there that are pretending that they're trying to offer up inspiration or a true honest account of their experiences.

Speaker 2:          01:42:59       But really what they're trying to do is say something that's going to get likes, you know, they're trying to say things that they think people are going to go, yeah, double high five. You know, there's a thing that people are doing where they're just trying to get social cred. I said, your social media is, man, I'll paint you the picture of my fake life. Right? I paint you a picture of my fucking real life. Yeah. Period. Like it or not, man. But that real life is fuel for people, right? It's fuel for me. I, I love that shit. I live off of it. There's a lot of people that I follow online and you're one of them that I can get something out of that I could watch a short clip of you talk and I'm sure it clips of this podcast. People are going to play these clips and go for fucking crazy runs afterwards. Right? Well hope so. Fuck yeah. So you don't even have to hope it's going to happen. That's good. That's good. What is this business you're doing?

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       Well? Is My own Goggins Llc. Um, basically I am invested in myself. I'm investing in myself and I hope that this story is, can, can change somebody's life, not to be me because ain't about me and I and I, I, I try to be as real as I can because we're all fucking suffering in this world. We're all hurting and I tried to take away all titles. You want to give me that, you know, that I did not come from that shit. That's, I have to be so authentic and so real about my own insecurities, my own false ma. This been a fucked up person. I'm not the best at anything. I'm not, I'm not gifted, I'm just driven. And um, it's all about trying to share that message with people. This is all about, you know, I speak to a lot of people and um, that's what, that's what I do now.

Speaker 1:          01:44:40       And how are you doing it as a business? I do some motivational speaking, but you know right now I'm not really trying to make a lot of fucking money. I'm just trying to build their brand as authentic as possible because I don't want to build it too fast because my. My biggest fear in life is people can rewrite through a motherfucker that's not real. I do all the time, like a lot of people have these great quotes and they and they and they mass produce. I can't mass produce something man, and they had these great quotes and shit, but are you living that motherfucker? What you just quoted in how powerful it may sound? Are you getting up every fucking morning and about working out whatever. Are you really getting the fuck after? Are you just talking to motivate people and I don't want to be that guy.

Speaker 1:          01:45:24       Or are you talking to pretend that you're exactly after it and people make this big money over here the side, which robin made a lot and they, they, they talk this shit and they're off this until it's gone. Then authentic it all, man. You got all this shit and I read it. I'm like, man, this guy, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, man. Fucking wake up, get after it. Live what you're saying, and then it comes. People can see when I talked, the reason I talk, so fucking, just passionate because I'm reliving my fucking life. I'm reliving this morning when I got up, I wouldn't do that shit. I'm reliving everything I did and I can't speak to you. Like all calm and shit just sucks. It sucks man. So whenever I started talking about like after this podcast, you'll see man, God, you're so calm right now. What the fuck is wrong with you?

Speaker 1:          01:46:11       I'm not going back through that shit man. I'm not. I'm not going back through the suffering and shit that it took to become who I am today. So I'm slowly trying to build this brand to the point where I can slowly, hopefully make people feel motivated to driven because motivation is crap. It's shit. People right now maybe listen to this shit. They'll be motivated to go run. If it's cold somewhere where they're at. A lot of my friends will shut that door, go back inside. That's motivation. It comes and go. As how you feel if you and your wife are good, if you and your kids are good, if you're good at work, you're motivated. I like the motherfucker whose life is imploded, ain't got shit in life. It says, still got fucking get after it today, man. To is about. So that's when you move from motivation to driven to obsessed and I want people to realize once you get to this person over here the driven obsessed part, you're unstoppable.

Speaker 2:          01:47:03       This commitment that you have to authenticity is one of the reasons why people are connected to what your messages. That's one of the reasons why what you're saying, you don't want to grow too fast. You don't want it to be bullshit. You're terrified of that thing. Just like we were talking about with weak. People are terrified of seeing that weakness in yourself. You know, we all see that. We've all seen motivational things that are bullshit. We've all talked to people that are talking and you realize there's nothing really that they're connected to. They're not really connected to their words, the words, just a bunch of words that they've pieced together because they sound like something that someone who's enlightened on the subject would say, yeah, it does. It doesn't, it doesn't connect. Oh, so you're struggle now is to try to figure out how to stay you and get the message out, but still be fully connected to that message.

Speaker 1:          01:47:52       Right. That's, you know. And it's not so much a struggle because I'm not really about.

Speaker 1:          01:48:01       I'm not driven by the business. I'm not, I'm not doing by trying to be. I make a very small salary from being retired from the military. That's all I need. So I'm not fast to A. I'm a, I'm a minimalist motherfucker. Give me a backpack of fucking ground and sleep on and a pull up bar and a fucking some running shoes in a subway sandwich or some shit and I'm fucking straight. So it's, um, I believe in patients. I'm a patient dude. I can watch the piece of grass grow for 20 years because I know that it is how you get somewhere in life by being that month like mentality. And being able to watch something grow very commonly, patiently, and that's all I'm doing right now. It's not about money. It's about people knowing me. I'll keep you like me. Whoever wants to hear this is out there. It's also your, your, your goal is to grow this slowly, very slowly. And your goal is to grow this in order to impact people. Period. I said, it's not about me. Um, what do you get out of impacting people? It's a good question. I don't, I don't get anything out of it. I'm a tool,

Speaker 2:          01:49:11       but you must get something. It must be personal satisfaction and must be a connection to those people. That must be, it must be enriching to you.

Speaker 1:          01:49:19       It's hard to connect with people because there's quite a few now that are coming in. It's my duty. It's my duty to share my. It's kind of like is somebody who discovered a new earth, you know, and discovered that people in the water source and the food source. I discovered a whole nother part of your fucking brain that a lot of people don't even know about is my job. I being a fucking on this journey of being a discovery person, being the person that maybe I discovered this part, I discovered a very important part to. I haven't met many people that have discovered as part of a lot out there, but it's my job now. Take these weak people in the category that I was in and say I stopped reading the bullshit. Stop listening to the bullshit and if, if my story of success can impact somebody, it is my job.

Speaker 1:          01:50:13       It's my duty to share the story. As much as I'm not really fond of it, I, I'm not. I'm the kind of guy that wants to sit in the fucking room and just be me. Just be me alone by myself as who I am, but I have to get uncomfortable and tell people all this shit. I think it feels good to tell me about it. At a fourth grade reading level in high school, I stuttered. I lied to people to be their fucking friends. It didn't feel good. It doesn't feel good at all, but maybe someone is doing the same shit and maybe they can realize, wow, that motherfucker was a piece of shit and he fucking now as a navy seal, retired guy and runs these miles and was 297 pounds and pathetic fucker. And Wow. And people say, why are you talking? So it's the fucking truth.

Speaker 1:          01:51:03       I was a fucking pathetic motherfucker, man. People cannot say that to themselves. This. We have to choose these great fucking magical words that, that makes that make people feel good. Tell yourself the truth is, I'm gonna cause you fucking fat. There may be bullying you, but you might be fucking fat. Some of cars you're dumb. It's mean, but you might be fucking dumb. It's life, man. Take it for what it's worth and change it and that terrible feeling. When someone does tell you that you're fat, you can use that as fuel, as fuel, period. And that's all this is about. And, and, and where it goes. If it goes somewhere and whatever, you know, I don't give a shit. Well, you said something that I think of when I run and I said most people quit at 40 percent. I said, that's my 40 percent rule, man.

Speaker 1:          01:51:53       I love that quote. Forty percent rule man. And I, um, I, I really developed that through my heart surgeries and I developed that through that first hundred mile run. And I thought I had given 100 percent that was on that chair at mile 70. I was fucked up. I thought I'd give it 100 percent and they go, that last I go, man, there has this. I wouldn't even near 100 percent. So I came up with this thing called the 40 percent rule is basically where you, it's like a car, you put a governor on a car and they said the car can go 1:30. That governor stops the car, 91. And your drive and thinking, man, I want to fucking Florida, but I can't go. I can't go any faster. We do at your brain. We put a governor on the brain secretary, feel pain, discomfort, suffering, all those words that we hate to say because we in this happy, peaceful world we live in.

Speaker 1:          01:52:41       Now we stop, we slow down, and if you can get through these different barriers and gain five percent, two percent, three percent debt, 40 percent becomes 60, that 60, 70, 80 and 90, and then you'll hopefully one day near 100. I don't, I don't know. Many people will probably add 100. I mean we think we're there, but there's so much more. It isn't a 100 death's door though. I really, I love that. I think is true. I think that's 100 percent true. I think when you were laying on top, you'd knocked on a door. That is a hundred percent true. No one has ever. That is 100 percent truth. I didn't give 100 percent in that 101 mile run I did for the first time. So that's the scary thing. That's the scariest thing in the world. I didn't die. You probably gave 99 point nine, nine, nine, nine, nine. I guarantee.

Speaker 1:          01:53:32       Guarantee Man. Dude, I don't know how to end this any better than that. So let's just wrap this up. If people want to find your stuff, what was the best place to go and look for it? I'm just at David Goggins, man. Social media or an instagram. Facebook. I don't tweet that much stuff out because, um, I write these. I write messages and always linked it on twitter to facebook and Instagram, but it's just at David Goggins is an honor and privilege. Thanks so much, man. I appreciate it. Really, really appreciate it. Thank you David Goggins. Ladies and gentlemen, go after it. You motherfuckers. Come on.

Speaker 3:          01:54:10       That doesn't.
