Speaker 1:          00:00:05       His name is Chris Hadfield. The book is and astronauts guide to life on earth. The book is in here that that's me. I never forget. I never remember. Rather turn my laptop off. You, uh, you were in space for 166 days. Mazing. That's insane. It's, it's when I sit on my dock and watch the space station go over, uh, it's really hard to rationalize cause I know I was up there and I can remember all the details, but to try and link in life on earth with, uh, with seeing that spotlight go across the horizon, it's still, I haven't got sorted out of my head how to connect it. Is that the longest of persons ever been up there? There was a Russian guy named Valerie poliakoff. State of 14 months straight. $400, whatever that is. Stays long time. Wow. Yeah. No, I'm nowhere near the record.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       That's still increased. One hundred 66 days is an incredible amount of time to be detached from gravity and floating around in space. What is the effect on your body? A big effects short term? Huge. Your body doesn't have to lift the blood up to your head when you're weightless, right? So your whole cardiovascular system changes all the nice little mechanisms that squeeze the balloon that is your body to get the blood up to your head. They stopped working. Your heart gets smaller, you start losing your skeleton. Your balance system completely shuts down. I mean it has no stimulus from gravity anymore. So you become totally visually based. So when you come home, it's brutal. Building all those things back up again. Um, and most of them you feel, I mean, you lose the callouses on the bottom of your feet. It's kind of disgusting cause you're sure your feet are like a snake up there.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       Over the bottom of your feet are shedding because you never used the bottom of your feet and you build up calluses on the top because you're always tucking your feet underneath things. So when you come back, you've even have to grow the calluses back in the bottom of your feet. And the thing that takes the longest is your skeleton. I lost about eight percent of the bone across my hips and butt. It's grown back and within about a year of landing all hopefully be back to normal one year. It takes one year for your body to fully recover. It took about four months before I could run normally again where my body would get the blood out of my feet and pump it properly back up to my head, about four months, which is almost as long as I was up in this trip. But uh, yeah, the bone takes the longest, but it's a, it's automatic, which is interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       My body got osteoporosis and it's reversing osteoporosis using some internal stimulus that we don't even understand. So it makes a pretty good medical study for everybody. I would imagine. So how long is. How long do you have to be in space before your body loses so much? Massive skeleton and the first time you take a leak in space, your urine is full of calcium and minerals. We do urine samples all the time and your body, we don't even know why. We don't know what sensors in the body recognize that you're weightless or why we would even have those sensors, but your body starts to shed your skeleton right away and we've, we can almost beat it now through a heavy exercise. We have a bunch of equipment on board, a resistive exercise and treadmill and bicycle and stuff. Um, and with that we can almost beat it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       But across my hips and my upper femur, we haven't been able to load that area up. Right? You always lift symmetrically on treadmill. He always run nice and symmetrically so you don't get all the banging transverse loads that you need to make your body keep the bones dense there. So how much of it can you preserve by using exercise? The rest of my body was fine. In fact, I increased muscle mass, decreased fat a little bit. My bones were at the same density. The only place we haven't solved yet is, is just the hip cradle. And I think with another iteration or two of our exercise equipment, we'll get that solved and then I'm going to go to Mars. Wow. So now, how long are you when you're doing exercise to try to build up what percentage of your day to doing two hours a day?

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       Every day? We do one hour of cardiovascular and one hour of resistive every single day. Seven days a week for the whole half a year. The up there that we've determined that's the best trade off between getting useful work done, you know, because it's a big multinational laboratory and keeping your body healthy. So we we commit about two hours a day. Did they, when they first started going up there, did they not do anything? No. We've tried a bunch of different things. The Russians even try to suit. They call a penguin suit, which is like a set of coveralls, tight fitting coveralls that's full of elastics so that every time you bend your elbow or move your twist, your body or something, you're fighting the resistance of the suit because they thought then you could sort of get it for free, but you need to demand it. You need to actually heavily force your body to exercise and if you do that and then you can stay in shape, but we've, you know, we started out with resistive exercise device and that it was the improved I read and now we're on a red, which is the advanced resistive exercise device as we've learned, you know, how to make it better so that we, uh, we can return to earth healthy or you know, when we go to the moon, but more importantly, what we going to.

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       Maurice Cook takes about half a year to get there. Well, we're, this is one of the problems we need to solve the Mars is really that next level trip, right? Because there's no coming back. It's, it's like several levels above where we are now. Station is in orbit around us. The space station. It's been up there 13 years now with people on board. Um, but it's like a sailing up and down the coast within sight of land. You know, we haven't had it across the body of water even to go to the moon as far as habitation goes. So right now we're just sailing up and down the coast of the world figuring out how to beat osteoporosis. How did the radiation, the psychology of it, the what to make the whole lot of, how do you make a toilet that works at the closed environmental system.

Speaker 1:          00:05:41       Got to invent all those things. Then I think we'll go to the moon because it's the next. It's only three days away and then we can do how to use resources that are there. How do you generate power? How do you navigate, how do you do all that? And then once we got that sorted out, then I think we'll go further. But it's still, you know, a lot of years away. What, what are the big hazards, the big hazards or radiation from space micro meteors? Yup. And what else? A psychological. How do you keep people sane and it's not so bad in the space station because we're close to the world. There's only like a two second delay talking on the radio so you can have a normal conversation. Just a little pause. But, uh, as soon as you start going to maurice, within a couple of weeks, you will never have another conversation with earth and normal and again, everything's got so much leg that she'll just have like recorded video messages back and forth.

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       And so the psych impact of that is going to be high and the earth will shrink to just another star within a couple of weeks, you know, and that, those people will become Martians in mind. They will no longer be from Earth. They will see themselves as separate. When I was on the space station the second time, one of the other crew members, her name is sue Holmes, uh, she and I were talking, we'd known each other since test pilot school. And in passing a throwaway thing, she didn't even think she was saying. She said, hey, you know, Earth said that we're supposed to do this next. And in my mind, not heard, Earth said, I heard those words come out of her mouth. And it was like she has in her mind, completely split off from the other 7 billion people. There's her crew and earth is one singular identifiable entity on the other side and that was a real bell ringer to me of what it's going to be like to go to Maurice.

Speaker 1:          00:07:23       Those people are going to be a completely discrete unit of people and there'll be Martians. They won't be earthlinks pretty quick. Their heads and how do you deal with that? How do we plan for that and it's still a long ways in the future, but it's one of the many things we need to sort out before we. Because as you say, once you get the engines going fast enough that you're. You're headed for Mars. You can't just turn around. There's no coming back. That's it. Well, I mean the Apollo Thirteen, right? They lost an engine on the way to the moon that coasted all the way to the moon and they just used like a ball on the end of a string. They just went around the moon with the gravity of the moon to sling them back at Earth again. So if something failed on the way to Mars, you could do the same thing, but it would take a year.

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       So you know, no problem can normally last a year to get resolved. So pretty much, yeah, you gotTa have all the problems solved before you head that way. And what about like sustainable resources? Like as far as like food and things like that, did they have to when they have to terra form when they get to Mars and we don't know. We're trying to figure all that out. I'm a really interesting discovery about three weeks ago. Curiosity, that big rover that, that is driving around on Mars right now has some pretty good equipment on it and it discovered just in the last few weeks that in every cubic foot of dirt on Mars, there's a quart of water. So there's oceans of water. I mean the topsoil is full of water on Mars. So that's really promising for when we get there. Um, because water is hydrogen and oxygen and oxygen to breathe hydrogen and oxygen mix fuel, hydrogen, oxygen makes water.

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       So that's a huge resource. The moon, there's water there, but it's really rare, so that's a big discovery for us eventually being able to go there, but you know, we need a power source. The Sun's a long ways away and it's dusty on Mars. You can't just, you can't have a solar powered bulldozer, you know, you need a power source and we need how do you navigate and there's just a whole, how do you build a perfect closed loop environmental system so that you don't have a constant losses and because the space station we only. I think it's about 92 percent of our water we reclaim, but we constantly need that little trickle from earth of new water because it's not perfect. There's, there's a whole. There's a lot of stuff we did when don't even know what we don't know yet and that's I think why will we'll start a lot of that out on the moon.

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       Before we launched a Mars, to me, watching the footage of the rover and the images that had sent back was almost surreal. It didn't seem real. It's hard for me to wrap my head around the idea that they sent a robot to another planet. It's roaming around taking pictures and sending them back and we're looking at it. Yeah, it's phenomenal. It's incredible that we could do that and and the way that, you know, Maurice has has just the wrong atmosphere. It's not thick enough to use a parachute in, but it's not thin enough that you can ignore it and just and just slow down and land with a rocket. You know, it's, it's, it's not good for landing. The Earth's atmosphere is nice and thick. You can come down under a parachute and the moon has none, so you can just like the Apollo guys, you can just land on your rocket plume.

Speaker 1:          00:10:31       Maurice, you're kind of stuck in the middle, so you need a complex landing system and curiosity. The way they came up with a solution to that was just phenomenal. The big Arrow break through the atmosphere and then that sequence of miracles and the retro rockets and the extendable bridal and everything. It is amazing that that worked and huge Kudos to the jpl guys and everybody who came up with it, that and the stuff it's teaching us about how planets work and what is what is the past and the future for that planet Mars and therefore gives us a lot better understanding of what's normal and what, what, what can we can expect on earth. A huge Kudos to those people. Indeed. I mean, they did an amazing, amazing thing and just one of those, in my opinion, one of those paradigm shifting moments where when we're back here on earth and we're watching those images, you're like, wow, they can do this now I'm, I'm an astronaut, an astronaut and you know, I've been in space twice and I gathered my family around to watch that thing happened because it's so. It is right on the edge of what we can just barely do. It's such a brave thing to do and such a capable probe, a capable extension of assault to put down on the surface and it's teaching us about Mars. Did you ever pay any attention to the face on Mars or any of that? Crazy. That's all fun. And, and you know, there's, there's faces all over. I mean, just lay on your back and look at the clouds. There's faces everywhere, right? That's sure. We naturally look for faces,

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       especially in weird shadowy images. Those images were mean. There were some really unique things. There's a rock near my house that's a square rock and when I have a friend who believes in a lot of conspiracy theories and he believes in the face on Mars and a lot of different stuff, and I said, I'm going to show you something, man. Come over here. I go, look at that rock. Do you think anybody made that rock? That rock has just made. That's just a rock amongst the pile of rocks. It's big and it's kind of square. Not Perfectly Square, but if you looked at a blurry picture of it that was taken from space, you would swear this is the building block for a paramed. Obviously, she's clearly made by an intelligent species. Same one that built the pyramids. Yeah, I know. It's, it's always easier to believe something than it is to understand it.

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       Yeah. The fascinating thing about the face on Mars is not that it looks like a face on Mars. It's the idea that Mars at one point in time actually could have sustained some form of life. In fact, definitely did. It had an atmosphere that was livable at one point in time. They really. There could've been some kind of life. Maybe it was just like microbes or plants or might still is the biggest volcano in the solar system, so it has heat and it has all this water, but we've just found now for sure and heat and water on earth always means life to me and just look under your sink and so on. On Mars. Maybe there's a fossil record of it. Maybe there's even something still primitive stuff living somewhere in the rock we don't know, but we haven't found any yet, but if we can find that on Mars and we know this life on earth and there's life everywhere and that would be a pretty important thing to figure out or the possibility that life actually started on Mars and some sort of an impact from an asteroid panspermia senate hurling towards birth.

Speaker 2:          00:13:34       I'm not sure that's a logical conclusion. You know, if, if life can start somewhere, then it can start in two places. Right. And so it doesn't have to miraculously be Panspermia from one planet to another if it formed on Mars than and there's life on earth and it's a more logical conclusion to think that it just formed in two places I think. Do you, when you, when you sit in that space station and you're floating above earth much as you were saying that your colleague started referring to Earth as a separate individual entity and you guys were separate from Earth. Did you look out when you're looking at the vastness of everything? I mean it's just everything. And Dee dee did feel like earth was in a neighborhood more like, you know what I mean? That we weren't isolated. That where it's so silly. The thing is so big.

Speaker 2:          00:14:25       Did you feel like more connected to the rest of the universe in any sort of a way? Joe And you're in the side of the spaceship and you look at the world, you're looking at it through the windows. And I came back, it was so funny. I came back from my first space flight and was sitting in the living room with my wife Halena and we were watching star trek and they show that scene with Sulu and whoever upfront and there's the, there were in the standard orbit, Mr Sulo and there's the curve of the earth underneath. And I remember going, that's it. That's exactly what

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       it looks like. They got that right. They guessed right in 1968 or whatever it was. Because when you're inside the spaceship, it looks like that. The difference is when you go outside and then um, you are, it's like the difference between sitting in your living room, looking outside and hanging on a cliff or you know, hanging on half dome or somewhere where it's an entirely different perspective even though it may look at the same thing. Being outside is a, is so immersive. The world is no longer nicely underneath you, like dark, like Sulu, but it is, it is this huge hanging, a spinning mass next to you and the universe is what's around you and you are, you are part of it. You're suspended in it. It's that we aren't used to have in the universe, under our feet, on all around us and, and feeling that you're in it not just sort of blow it, looking up at it and that is really different and that's when you really see that the world is just in the neighborhood and that it is a ball with the moon being a ball in the son's over there.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       And if we go up there, that's Maurice. You really get that feeling when you're out on a space walk.

Speaker 2:          00:15:59       I've heard several astronauts talk about that feeling and that that moment when they are outside of the spacecraft and looking at the universe itself and saying that it changed them forever.

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       Uh, it gave me a profound respect and also I'm, I don't even know. I mean nobody knows the answer, right? Big Bang and all the rest of it and all the, all the belief systems around the world and how everybody deals with all that. And I sure don't know the answer to that, but when you look at the world, it's, it's really hard to convince yourself that it's random. Just looking at it, it's like how can that possibly be? But then again, if you look a little further out, there's, you know, how could maurice be random and how could all the other planets, how could Saturn, the way it looks to be just a random event. And, and, uh, the unlimited number of stars that are out there and the planets we're seeing around other stars directly. I don't know how to resolve it. In my mind, I didn't, I didn't, uh, find the meaning of it all. Like being on a spacewalk, if anything, it just deepened my dumb foundedness at the, uh, at the immensity of it in our tiny little part of it.

Speaker 2:          00:17:12       Yeah. I've often thought that questions pondering questions like the randomness of the universe or the, just the reality that we know about subatomic particles and the idea of the universe being this fractal thing and impossible and never ending. I think it's almost like walking up to a mountain and going, yeah, I could see how that could be picked up, but you can't really pick it up yourself. So you're just like, man, I guess. I guess it could be random. I don't know what I don't understand. I don't even know what the fuck random means. The idea of random seems the universe itself seems to be this incredibly complex thing has not just laws but very clear directions that things move into. It constantly is complexifying from the big bang till now. And the idea of black holes, the eating matter and creating a singularity and that possibly these new, these new astrophysicists and string theorist guys are saying that they think that inside every black home may in fact be a completely different universe.

Speaker 1:          00:18:16       You know on the top of the space station, we have a experiment put there by a Nobel prize winning physicist named Sam Ting and it's from cern, from the big particle accelerator that's under. I'm Switzerland and France to their baby and it's up there. It's a huge magnet and what it's doing is collecting subatomic particles of the universe and it's. It's got layer after layer of detector so I can try and figure out what they all are as they come ripping through and it's collected trillions and trillions of them. It's been up there for the last couple of years and the reason is we don't know what the universe is made of. We can only account for five percent of the universe with the known particles that we have five. We don't know what 95 percent of the universities even made of. And so we call it dark energy and dark matter, and we're trying to indirectly prove that those exist based on the proportions of the subatomic particles were collecting up in the top of the space station and it's a decade, a long project, and they released the first layer of the results back in the spring and it's starting to look like, like maybe some of the theories are correct, but we're, you know, we've talked as if were were conclusively brilliant and we understand everything.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       I mean we're still calling things dark matter and dark energy. We have no idea. I'm just trying to figure it out.

Speaker 2:          00:19:32       That's another word for magic. It is indeed. It's another word for, I don't know. Well, it's, we, we are most certainly the smartest and the most informed human beings that have ever existed as far as we know, the two of us. No, no. Denying me 100 percent. I'm not an idiot. But as far as like humans that have ever lived where the the most informed the most technologically capable, but much like when we look back at the renaissance era, or we'll look back at Galileo being in prison because he dared question the idea that the earth wasn't the center of the universe. We're going to make fun of us some day. They're going to make fun of us like these dummies. They didn't know what Clark was glue on. Plasma was. They had to use a particle accelerator to prove that the Higgs Boson existed. Yeah, I agree. We're going to look at the space shuttle and go. What were they thinking? I'm at station wagon. I think it's just so ridiculous. Like a DC three now. You know. That's one thing I really wanted to bring up with you. You know, you, you had to take one of those up there. You have to take some sort of a spaceship up there. What is the feeling like of good? Did you have to get an, a Russian one?

Speaker 1:          00:20:39       My first two flights were on shuttles. I flew Atlantis and then endeavor and then my third flight I was left seat, so sorta like the pilot of the Soyuz, so I flown them. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       So you flew when the space shuttle was in operation and you flew the Russian version of the space shuttle. What's the difference?

Speaker 1:          00:20:57       The shuttle is is so much more capable. It is the most capable flying machine humans have ever built. Unbelievable. And three quarters of everybody who's ever flown in space flew on the shuttle. It was the first great lifter. It's purpose was to take a huge spy satellite up. This was the conception of the sixties and early seventies. Take the best technology. 60 spy satellite launch out of Vandenberg. Go straight north, go halfway around the world, take pictures of the hot spots of the world, come back again, and then use the wings to be able to go sort of sideways and side slip because the world's turned underneath you and come back and land again after one orbit. That's why we had wings on the shuttle was so that we could carry this huge telescope and they weren't automated back then, so we needed a crew to be able to operate the telescope.

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       That's why the payload bay was the size that it was and why the shuttle could lift the amount that it could lift. It was to meet all those requirements. That all immediately stopped being the reason for the space shuttle to exist, but the design was already set. What that gave us though was a vehicle that could carry, gosh, 40 or 50,000 pounds up in a payload bay that's a size of a city bus and then bring it back and land it gently on a runway and carry a crew up to seven. So is like a space station all on its own and amazingly capable vehicle. Amazingly complex too. And when things are amazingly complex, they're really expensive and hard to operate safely and we lost two crews, you know, as a result of the complexity of it. The Soyuz is designed to take three people and a tiny bit of gear up to the space station doc. Stay there for half a year or longer as their lifeboat and then at the end of time get back in and come back home again. That's the uses purpose and it does that really well, but it's tiny and very purpose built. The two of them are magnificent vehicles, but built for way different purposes and both very carefully evolved to do what they do. Um, you know, exquisitely well. Um, and I, I'm lucky to have flown on both. That sounds so incredible. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:23:05       What is the g force field like when you take an off from the,

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       the launchpad you go straight up. Of course you have to get above the air. Um, if, if you want to stay in orbit, you got to go five miles a second. If you're going a little slower, it's, it's sort of like throwing something sideways. It gravity pulls it down. But if you can throw it sideways at five miles a second, then gravity will still pull it down. But the earth curves away underneath it. If it's going fast enough, you know, it's like, goes over the horizon before it falls. So that's how we stay at orbit is we go five miles a second, but you can't go five miles second in the air, the frictions just too high. So the rocket ships take you straight up to get you above the air. And that takes about two minutes going straight up and in 45 seconds here through the speed of sound, straight up and accelerating.

Speaker 1:          00:23:56       And in 70 seconds you're through the altitude and speed of the concord accelerating, straight up. And after two minutes here, about 160,000 feet and six times the speed of sound, but you're above almost all of the air. And then your first stage falls off. So inside it's this, it's this incredibly powerful push in your back like a dragster. But like one that's, that's gone off the road, the vibration of, of uh, pushing through the air, that's, it's a, it's like a tuning fork kind of vibration. This enormous powerful jaws of a dog kind of ride straight up. But then after two minutes, the solids are the, the stage that got you above the air, all out of fuel. It explodes off because you don't want to carry all that dead weight with you anymore. And then you use the remaining engines for the next six minutes or six and a half to accelerate out horizontal basically to five miles a second.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       And uh, and so for the last six minutes, it's like a long liquid drive, heavy, steady pushing someone with their fist in your back, pushing you faster and faster and faster, smoother ride because you're above the ear. And after just under nine minutes, like eight, eight, 45 or so, you're exactly the right place, the right direction, and the right speed, the engine shut off. And you're in space and you're weightless. So it's nine minutes. Yep. It's 8:42 on the shuttle and just under nine, like 8:55 for the Soyuz. What's the maximum g force you experienced during that? Uh, the shuttles about three g. and in fact, when you hit three g with the throttle start coming back, because it was only built for about three and a half g. So three times your normal weights. If he weighed 200 pounds, you weigh 600 pounds in there. The so use is about four or four and a half.

Speaker 1:          00:25:39       So if you're 200 pounds a year up around, you know, eight, 900 pounds. I got a ride with the blue angels and whether those f eighteens ones, I was nfat pilot for a lot of years. Those are incredible. That's a great airplane. You got to fly those. Yeah. What's the most jeezy pulled in the moment? One of those things. If you take an f 18 and you grabbed the stick and you snap it into your lap, um, you aren't actually connected to anything except a computer. It's little sensors. It's fly by wire. So it says wow, he wants to turn right now. And so then it moves all the control surfaces of the airplane, but it doesn't want to break the wings off. So it will limit you. It's, it's the airplane limits, the amount of Ge that it can pull and it'll give you about eight g about age.

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       That's all it will give you because otherwise you could structurally damaged the airplane. So there was a paddle, you could actually, if you are going to hit the ground, you could hit this paddle that would override the g control system and snap it in your lap and just give you whatever the aerodynamics would give you. We've had people pull 12 g but uh, but the Soyuz, if you come into the atmosphere the wrong way, can pull 20 or 22 g on the way home, which is just, just wicked. And that happened once in the Russian experience live that you're lying down when you're in fat. And like when you flew with the Blue Angels, you're sitting upright. So when you pull back, it pushes the g, the blood down to your feet. So the real limitation is how much of that can you stand before you can't.

Speaker 1:          00:27:08       You can't stay awake for your blackout in a Soyuz we're actually laying on her back so the blood doesn't drain out of your head. It just gets kind of pushed to the back of your body. So therefore you can survive it. It won't block you out, it doesn't damage you. It's, it's sorta like a prolonged car crash, you know, people pull 20 g in a car crash, but it's instantaneous if you fall into the atmosphere the wrong way in a Soyuz. Then as you hit the thick atmosphere, it's almost like crashing into something super high gp for maybe 30 seconds and then then you come through that gp can slow down and it's survivable. But I wouldn't want to write it.

Speaker 2:          00:27:47       That feeling must be just incredible. What, what are the thoughts that are going through your mind when you're, when you're going that fast shooting up in this space.

Speaker 1:          00:27:54       I, uh, it was funny. You know, I'm focusing on the job because there's a million things that can fail and one of the mantras of astronauts is there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse. So we think of it that all the time. And so we, we really are careful in the way up and so a big part of you is involved with that, but another part of you is just, is just loving the ride so much. And I found after a while that my cheeks were hurting and I was like, why is my face hurt? And I realized because this smile, this big stupid smile on my face, so much of my cheeks were cramping up because it was so much of a thrill. That's an amazing. Yeah. It was like heaven. You know, one one, those two people on your shoulders, one that's being all serious in one that's yelling bad advice to you. The one that's having a good time is just going ahead.

Speaker 2:          00:28:44       I just love on the ride. It is so much fun. Guess that's a good time to do that, right? Because you're completely helpless. Actually. Joy. Helpless

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       at all. Yeah. You're, you're, there's all sorts of stuff that you're responsible for on the way up in the way down. And even in the is when you lying down. Oh, in the suite. What do you have? Full control panel and there's stuff you have to do or you have to do as it's happening. Oh yeah. What do you do? Why, why? While you're flying, if everything works perfectly, we're just watching. And, and same in the shuttle. We have very, you know, hopefully don't have to do anything, but sometimes things don't go right and then you got a bunch of things you can do, you know, various shutdowns in a board, certain people probably don't know, but, uh, the shuttle as it launched up the east coast of theu , s, uh, we kept abort landing runways all the way up to coast. You could land at Cherry point or can land in New York, you could land in Newfoundland or all those places.

Speaker 1:          00:29:33       And so as you're ticket up the coast, you're constantly going, okay, if we have a failure, now we're going to abort this way. We're going to turn around and land in Bermuda. We're going to land here, we're going to land. And you practice those like crazy. Then you get to a certain point and then you would land in North Africa or South France or in Spain and all those windows, all those tick points, all those, uh, thresholds. You have to get your word. That's what we're hyper aware of. We're not, we're not along for the ride. Wow. So while this is all going on, you have these big giant smile and you still are calculating. Oh yeah. You still going? Okay. If it screws up now I go here. Oh yeah. I run into my thumb down a long list of all the various wickets that you're jumping through.

Speaker 1:          00:30:12       Yeah. You pay attention. How much of the trip is automated? How much of it is manual? Uh, we'd like it to be as automated as possible because, uh, if it's, if that means things are predictable and things didn't break and for the vast majority of shuttle flights. And so he was flights, it's automated, but sometimes it's not. I'm on the way up hill and we've had engines fail or engine start to fail, had to shut engines down and go to backup or at least, uh, a reserve, a configuration of the engines. You get the launch. Yeah. During lunch that happened at a couple of shots. It happened on Apollo as well on the way back to Earth. Uh, we've had serious problems with the Soyuz where, uh, you have to take over and try and fly manually or come in ballistically, which means it loses its ability to steer on the way home and you just start spinning the vehicle and then it just comes in like, like a pure media, right?

Speaker 1:          00:31:06       And you pull about eight or nine g on a ballistic entry and that's, uh, that's, that's pretty tough after six months of weightlessness to suddenly, if you're a 200 now a 1600 or 1700 pounds. And that's, that's, that's pretty hard on the body. Wow. It's incredible the feeling that you must have had when you actually stepped onto ground again. What was that like? It's awful. It's awful. You're, you're so nauseous and dizzy. And, and, um, the reason is of course, a, your vision is telling you one thing, telling you where the horizon is, where up is, but your inner ear, which normally when your eyes are closed, keeps you from falling over. You know, you can close your eyes and not fall over. That has forgotten completely what to do with gravity because you've been weightless first, whatever, five or six months. So now you have this sudden great violent disagreement between what your eyes are saying and what your inner ear is saying.

Speaker 1:          00:32:04       It's like if you spend 50 times and then stop spinning and you stagger around, so your body says, oh, there is something seriously wrong. Why is his vision so wildly different than his inner ear? And for the last million years, one of the probable cause is was you ate something poisonous. You ate some sort of neurotoxin or something that is messing up your internal systems and it might kill you. So the first thing your body makes you want to do is throw up because it's trying to get rid of whatever it was you just ate. And then the next thing your body makes me want to do is go lay down and go to sleep. Stopped it, right? It's trying to keep you alive. So when you first get back from space, your body's just screaming at you to throw up and glide down. But, uh, you know, you got all this stuff to do and people were there to meet you and um, and you're trying to just ignore those symptoms and, and pay attention to what, you know, what's going on.

Speaker 2:          00:32:58       Is there a happiness along with that? I mean, is there a feeling of being home?

Speaker 1:          00:33:03       Oh yeah, yeah, all three of my flights and, and if the flight went well and we work hard enough that they almost always do, there's a great sense of satisfaction because we just, it's like the final step in an extremely complicated process where you have done everything right or enough things right that, uh, that you can, you can like Kinda have that for the rest of your life. So there's a, there's a tremendous feeling of, of joy and pride and accomplishment. And when you get back to Earth,

Speaker 2:          00:33:33       I have always been fascinated by space and if you look up you can see the lights here are covered with sudden I like, I like your lights stars good. Um, but what, what drives me nuts is how little we actually get to see of the stars because of light pollution. I was a at the big island and I went to the Keck observatory. Yep. And there's the, uh, there's a station where the telescope is and then below that at like 9,000 feet. There's like this visitor station. Have you been? Uh, I've been near there. I put up at the top of a couple of the mountains there to have a look at the sky. It's in incredible. It's, we, I was, I was, when we were driving up there, I was worried that it was too cloudy. I was like, oh, this is going to be terrible, you know, we wanted to go and see the stars and we picked a cloudy night, but we drove through the clouds.

Speaker 2:          00:34:19       And then when you get above there and you realize that the entire big island, they have special diffused lighting to make sure that they don't emit light pollution. The view is life changing. It must be like one, 1000000th of what you experience on the space station. But for me it was a real life changing moment. I'll never forget it and I'll think about it all the time. Whenever I look at the stars, I always think about that night in Hawaii, that's what it looks like, but, but even crazier, there's a. there's an image of it up there, but even crazier when you're actually experiencing and you could see the Milky Way, and I remember thinking, God, we have to figure out a way to stop light pollution because I think just that, just being able to look up and see that would change people's perceptions and would probably make people way more enthusiastic about space.

Speaker 1:          00:35:10       People know, of course the vast majority of people live in cities and the places that have the worst light pollution of the city. So I had a similar experience to yours when I was in fat pilot. I would get it up to high altitude. I'm going on a cross country, especially in the north, put on the autopilot and it's shut off every light in the cockpit and let my eyes adjust. And you're already up at 40, 45,000 feet and so there's almost no atmosphere above you and you could see the texture of space. You can see the Milky Way. You can see why it's called the Milky Way. I mean, it's a, it's a white, gray, white part of the sky, you know, and you don't need a telescope to see it. You can just see it with your eyes. You don't need some special time lapse photography.

Speaker 1:          00:35:49       So, uh, it, it, it, it's both humbling and uh, and really inspiring I think to see, puts everything into perspective, but I don't know, even if you're trying to work on light pollution, people are indoor creatures and cities and they have street lights and they drive around in cars and I don't know how you get people to notice the universe around them. I think it would help if they could just see it start. If you look up in Los Angeles, ca, what do you see? You see a star. I lived in Houston for a long time and yeah, I look at that. I can see 18 stairs tonight. It's a real clear night, barely. But when you're up there and the, and the observatory and I'm sure when you were at 40,000 feet in the jet, it must have been amazing. Yeah, it's, it, uh, it's not that much further away.

Speaker 1:          00:36:38       I mean, uh, the big island mountain is not all that high, but you just need one sometimes one small step and you can see a whole new thing. Yeah. I had some similar but not quite as intense viewings in the mountains above boulder, Colorado. So like at 8,500 feet up there, it was beautiful too. But I think that we forget that we're really in space. It's as stupid as that sounds really do forget. So I was going around the world and my son who ran the social media for the flight to a large degree, send me a note saying, Hey dad, Mt. Etna is erupting in southern Italy, have a look of Mount Etna. So I'm a good dad. Took a picture of how Aetna, but I'm seeing the superheated lava and the smoke and the steam coming out of the earth, uh, was a really, especially when you're looking at the world as a ball, was a really clear reminder of the fact that most of the planet is super heated lava and magma and where it's so hot that the rock is liquid and plastic right then and we just live on this little chilled crust like, like the top of a porridge pot, you know, and we just live on this little thin bit at the top that is crossed.

Speaker 1:          00:37:47       And when you tip it the other way around and look up half of the atmosphere is in the first three miles, three miles, you know, think about why people go for a three mile run. You know, that and half really the whole habitable atmosphere is three miles above 15,000 feet. It's hard to even live. And we live in beats on this little bit of cooled crust and this little sliver of air. And we think it's guaranteed. We think we think we're invincible, right? And we think the whole universe is here to serve us and we're like, we're like bacteria in a corner, you know, just just found a little niche that will support our life. So much so that we're willing to almost our entire system as far as energy is based on burning thing. Yeah. Let's face it, releasing few talk about a hundred years from now looking back and going, what were we thinking? I mean, Golly, I mean you can see why a five gallon pail of gasoline is an amazingly enabling thing. You can stick it in your car and drive hundreds of miles, you know, and you can carry it in your hand and it's fairly stable. It's a very seductive fuel. But at the same time it has such consequences. And when we look, when we figure out the next energy source, when we look back, hopefully in a couple of hundred

Speaker 2:          00:39:01       years we will go, what were we thinking? Oh, crazy. Yeah. We see the. It's really hard for people to change to once once we have a pattern that we follow, it's very difficult, especially if we found a way to make it work for ourselves in spite of all the pollution. We still rock it that way. In spite of all the stuff that we throw into the ocean. We still kind of happening basically on a daily basis. Well, you can't. Once you built a structure, it's really hard to change of course, and you can't just suddenly start. Millions of people are killed, millions of people just because you decide to change energy sources. It has to be gradual and we will be weaned off fossil fuels, but they got to get a lot more scarce before we're going to bother just because of its human nature. Will. The ultimate use of fossil fuels is a g is a rocket. I mean that's the ultimate display of it. Shooting into space with a giant plume of fire behind you. It's a brute force way. I mean it. We're burning dinosaurs to get this space, but it's so far. It's the only way we figured out how so far it's the only way. Now when you, you think about like what's possible for the future when they start talking about all these different propulsion methods that will someday be available. What if any of them appear viable?

Speaker 1:          00:40:14       Yeah. You're asking me to predict physics, uh, inventions of the future, which, Gosh, I wish I could do that. I'd go, I'd do it tomorrow. I don't know, uh, to, to me the obvious answer is, uh, every single molecule that exists, every complex molecule and Adam was put together in a blast furnace of a place with almost unlimited heat and pressure, which is the center of a son and it stored that energy in every single atom and molecule that exists. And we have yet to find a good way to get that energy back out. But there is more energy and a pencil. You know, if you, if you could truly get the energy that's inside all of the molecules that are in there, there's, there's so much energy stored there. You know, we have like wood that stored sunlight, right? And we by burning it, we can release that stored solar power, even nuclear, but we haven't found a clean way to release the energy to gives us nuclear power. We can do it, but we're still, you know, we're kind of cave men about it and we haven't got a clean way. So I'm certain that at some point we will figure out how to, whether it will be cold fusion or, or just fusion itself, but if you read what they're doing in the various laboratories around the world, even the experts think, well, we're probably years away

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       from, from being able to contain fusion so that it becomes a net positive power source. And, but you know, when the experts are saying it's 50 years until we can do it, who knows? Yeah. There was a recent article in one of the science magazines that the volume of nuclear waste could be reduced by 90 percent that they've shown that they can mix plutonium contaminated waste, uh, with blast furnace slag and turn it into glass and it reduces its volume by 85 to 95 percent and effectively locks in the radioactive plutonium creating a stable end products. I've always felt like, I mean, the, the nuclear waste thing is a huge issue obviously. I mean, they've done a lot of weird things like dig holes in the ground and buried in there. And Nevada and you know, and what's going on now in Fukushima is very disturbing.

Speaker 2:          00:42:24       They're trying to figure out how to contain it. Sure. Coming up with all these different ways, but it's a fascinating thing about human innovation. If their backs are up against the wall, those crazy monkeys figuring out a way to fix things. Yeah. And it's just our nature and necessity is the main mother and we need to. Sometimes we don't think we have the necessity. And nuclear waste is a big problem with fossil fuel waste is a huge problem as well. And neither of them are perfect. Even solar energy has waste, you know, because of you have to build all the solar panels and you have to collect all the rare earth metals. None of it's for free. We have to find as best to trade off as we can and, uh, and still be able to try and sustain as good as standard of living for as many people around the planet as possible.

Speaker 2:          00:43:06       And uh, and we've done we, I mean, we feed more people now than we ever have, right? But, but how, uh, how do we do it in the future? How do we get better at it? I'm not sure he, there's so many variables obviously. And, but I, I'm, I'm always very excited when I see something like this that has like, oh my faith in the crazy humans has been restored like these, these nuts have figured out a way to fix an issue or at least reducing issue significantly by as much as 90 plus percent. Um, the, the, the fossil fuel thing to me is a, is a weird one because obviously I enjoy it, we use it, it's so important for almost everything we do, but obviously this is going to create a problem some day and there's no better example for that for me than the automobile pollution or pollution that you get from jet airplanes, uh, on a daily basis.

Speaker 2:          00:43:58       How much it means there's a big impact in the environment. Every time the space shuttle gets launched, isn't it a, well, compared to everything else it's. Well, and of course space shuttle is retired, but we only flew the special at 135 times. I mean, you couldn't even measure compared to everything else, the pollution that it injected, if it had gotten to the point where it was like Arab travel. Yeah. Well you wouldn't want, you know, thousands of those launch and everyday, you know, but that wasn't, that wasn't a possibility. It wasn't. But it was going to do. But compare it to just, you know, how we burn coal to generate electricity and how we use to transport ourselves

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       around the, uh, you know, there are 40, what, 42,000 people a year killed just in car crashes, you know, that is a, it's a societal norm in the United States. We expect that. We say that's okay. It's all right to kill 42,000 people. So we have the freedom to drive our cars around wherever we want. Kind of an interesting level of accepted a disaster, you know, we just say that's okay. And that's not, that's not some global warming problem that may manifest itself on our children. That's a guaranteed thing this year. And uh, and that's, uh, just an interesting thing to hold up the mirror and look at yourself and say, okay, that's, that's what we decide is alright,

Speaker 2:          00:45:12       who's also a matter of, of a very statistically significant number of years of your life that you lose by living in a small filled environment. That's a fact. Sure. And we don't think about that because you can survive and be healthy in New York City, you know, you can go jogging down the streets of Manhattan and you know, drink spring water and think everything's all groovy. But the reality is if you're living in a city and you're breathing in those fumes on a daily basis, it will reduce your life. Period. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       But, but yeah, I agree with you, but none of us are lasting forever and people live where they want to live for all the reasons. And only one of the variables is how many years are you going to live there?

Speaker 2:          00:45:48       Right? Would you rather live in the middle of nowhere where the air is clean, but there's no people to talk to or in the theater is really bad. Theater is always bad. Let's be honest. What's the best theater or even nearly as good as the best movie. It's not even close, antiquated, goofy art form. I'm okay here. I have to ask you about these guys. Yep. Aliens. That little alien guy. Sam, when, when you're up there, when you're in space,

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:46:21       do you ponder the possibility? And is that something that you ever wonder yourself? Are there intelligent life forms out there? And if so, do you think that they watch us? Do you think they're aware of us?

Speaker 1:          00:46:33       You mentioned earlier that with Galileo inventing the telescope, uh, he was tortured for pointing out that we weren't the center of the universe and I'm with every invention that's come since then, we've been able to prove more and more conclusively just how far from the center of the universe we are and also how huge the university is. And billions of years old and, and more vast. The numbers are so big, they're, they're incomprehensible both in numbers of, of stars and number of galaxies. And within the last few years, using the great-great-grandchildren of, of Galileo's telescope, we are seeing planets directly, seeing planets around nearby stars. And we've seen thousands of them. So we've basically shown that every single star has planets. And so there's an unlimited number of planets out there. And so to think that with an unlimited number of that, we are the only life in the universe to me is just a natural extension of thinking that we're the center of the universe. You know, it's an arrogance, egotism thing was based on belief instead of fact. But it's also, I think arrogant and egotistical to think that were so fascinating and we're so revelation area and, and so special that somehow a weird big black eyed monsters with no hair on their bodies are sneaking around staring at us because we are so special. To me that's just. I mean it's fun science fiction and it makes for great entertainment, but it's a, it's not real.

Speaker 2:          00:48:07       Well. I've heard that the archetype of the, the doctor, the alien with the large black eyes and the, the, you know, the strange big head that what it may very well come from is that the actual birth experience for children the first time the eyes are outside of the womb, they don't have clear vision and they see the bright light of the operating room, which is the first time they've ever been exposed to something like that. And it's an incredibly traumatic experience. They recognize the eyes, which are enormous in front of the head, the face with a white mask on it, feature lists interesting. And that this is most likely what the archetype of the experience, the, uh, the medical experiments that supposedly go on with these aliens, that, that's the origin of it. And it's, well, we have this very arrogant idea that children don't remember things, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:48:57       And it's been my point about circumcision I, I don't think circumcision is a good idea. I think it's ridiculous. I think it's antiquated. It's Jen genital torture. And I think the justification is one of them is that the baby doesn't remember it. And I'm always like, how do you know the baby doesn't remember just because they don't have a point of reference or context. It's very possible they remember it well. The scientific answer to the alien abduction experience and these cold hard medical examinations, emotionless medical examinations may very well just be the birthing process or some of it will search both. And then the, you know, the incredible feeling of helplessness that they have is basically their body doesn't move yet and that these intense memories are burned deep, deep, deep into our consciousness.

Speaker 1:          00:49:43       I think it also just comes from a fear of being alone and a fear of being mortal. And if we can somehow convince ourselves that, that neither of those two things are true, then it's a great comfort to folks and to think that, that there's other life out there. And, and it's, it's, uh, it's, it's holding us as super special and it's been here before and it's going to be back. It's, it's a nice seductive thought process to go down. So, but there is there. I mean, we have left Earth, we have 13 years ago this month, we permanently started living on the space station with the International Space Station program. And the Soviets had been there for decades before on their space stations. We have sent probes to every planet in the solar system and got one going out to Pluto right now. And we're rovers on a couple different, three different planets and moons in the solar system. Uh, if aliens did show up, I don't think their behavior would be the one that is in the common science fiction media, you know, it just doesn't make sense. So, so I, uh, I am convinced there's life in the universe, you know, just starting the statistics of it. It just makes sense. It's, it's just, um, it's just egotism to think that we're that special. But I think it's also just egotism to think that we're so special that were the object of great secretive fascination by higher beings.

Speaker 2:          00:50:58       Well, I think you're very humble and so you look at us and say that it wouldn't be that interesting, but I say to you, imagine if we found out that there was a planet just outside of our solar system where there were some people that were, were there, they were just like human beings, but they will like human beings from the 13 hundreds. Yeah. They just hadn't figured anything out yet. We would be like, holy shit, they have guns. They figured out the wheel that lighten their city's on fire. They're crazy. They just haven't figured out mass communication yet. And most of them can't read. I think we would be as a lot like us right now. It's just a lot like us right now. We really haven't changed that much. But I mean if we found some people just from a thousand years ago, a thousand years in our past, we would be absolutely incredibly fascinated.

Speaker 2:          00:51:39       I think if we found some being somewhere that had harnessed the power of fire, and if we went back 40,000 years ago, I think we'd find it incredibly fascinating. So the stuff that we can do, I don't buy it. I think if I was an alien, I would be so fascinated by these freaks, these pink monkeys with bank sticks and the Internet and religions and all the freak show stuff that we have down here on earth. I think we would be the most wonderful freak show of all time. I've often said that if there is, if there is intelligent life in the earth that I think are outside of earth, I think that earth is probably the Tiawana of outer space. Which explains why all visitations come in the middle of the night, that they're just, they're hammered and they want to see a show. They want to go see the freak show.

Speaker 2:          00:52:23       I think if I was an intelligent being, I do not buy the idea what would be so special about human beings? Where do we start? Okay. There's a lot special about this crazy species above all other species on this planet. There's 7 billion of them. Okay. They're like rats on a sinking ship. They inhabit every little spot in the ocean, find a little floating thing. Poking out of the ocean were some plants are growing on it. Boom is a whole whole sea of people live in there. You know, go to Hawaii, this little tiny spot. It's a million people in Hawaii who were crazy and I think I would look, I think we got to go there and we got to go to earth. I think we would be probably one of the most fascinating things to observe because we're so incredibly advanced and yet so contradictive so, so hypocritical, so ridiculous, so easily led, so easily tricked and fooled.

Speaker 2:          00:53:14       We have access to instant information, but yet we choose to believe some of the most ridiculous things of all time. Yeah, I, I agree with you though that I find the evidence of us context, but aliens, incredibly uncompelling and the people that I talked to, I, I did a Scifi show called Joe Rogan questions. Everything where I met with a lot of these Ufo guys and I felt like I was talking to religious fanatics. Yeah. It's just like talking to a religious fanatic. It's just they feel like they're too clever for the Koran, so they fall for the blue book project. Blue Book is their, their Lord. So two weeks ago a satire paper in Canada published a thing about what I did at a movie theater watching the movie gravity and they said, I heckled it and I've heard about that and I farted to protest the movie.

Speaker 2:          00:54:00       You did all this stuff and got thrown out of the theater. That's really rude. I thought it was very funny. Right? Read this article. Thousands of people believed it and sent notes and send it to their friends and hey look, hey, look, hey, look, this is, this must be the truth because I believe it and that thinking is so easily prevalent and dominates a lot of populist conclusion making when in fact it's not based on fact at all because people want to believe stuff, but they don't want to spend any time actually doing the thinking or the research about it. And so, uh, you know, that that's pervasive, right across all cultures, including what people think about, you know, alien abduction. Yeah. That was also a real problem with the access to information right now. So beautiful. Anybody can get information at anytime but it's not vetted.

Speaker 2:          00:54:47       So, and there's also a lot of what they call satire sites, which are just not satire. They just lie, right? I mean, there's, there's been, there's this one national news something or another website that people keep constantly tweeting me stories from and they just make up stories. There was one about that, uh, I retweeted before I read where it came from, that Texas decided to use sexual predators for medical experiments and there's, but there's just, it's just a lie. There's no, it's like if you read the onion within five minutes or five seconds, you realize, okay, they're doing comedy. This is funny business humorous, they, they're not being humorous, just lying and they're calling it satire. When you see that attributed to you like farting in a movie theater, that's rude. And I've read it and I, I had it sent to me like, this guy's an asshole.

Speaker 2:          00:55:34       Like he farted in the movie. It made me laugh, but the reaction to it made me laugh as well. It's just like, come on people please, we, you know, we, we are actually sell separate from the one celled organisms. We have brains and reason and experience in logic and use it. We're clearly still developing clearly. Right? I mean there's both and everybody. This folks like you that have experienced technology and innovation at its very height, the, the, the, the highest highs, you've actually gone out above the, the actual atmosphere of our earth, and you've experienced the amount of technological sophistication that it takes to pull something like that off. But then there's other folks that are barely there, chimps with a language and they exist amongst us because of this complex society. It makes it really for people to just get by and breed and make more dumb people. It's so. It's so easy. Well, so you've got to have that, right? Is this the Yin and the Yang of life?

Speaker 1:          00:56:34       Uh, you know, I think the real key to it is what does everybody want to get out of it? What do you want to get out of your life and what do you, what do you find is your own compulsion? What, what is it that that gives you the satisfaction at the end of the day and it may be that stuff you've read on the internet or maybe the television show that you watch or maybe the sports team that you idolize, read maybe some new invention somewhere or some area or your huge belief into some particular subset of what we know or we don't know. And to me that's all right. Everybody should be doing that. So long as they're pushing themselves to something that they're interested in. They're trying to get the best out of the things that they're naturally inclined towards and, and make the most of it.

Speaker 1:          00:57:16       It's just been what I've been doing. I'm just interested in this particular part of space flight and a and m case, or was fine by me live and let live, but don't spend all of those efforts in taking your particular set of interests and your beliefs that, that have given you this area and trying to force them on other people. Make them good for you. Offering them up for other people to believe if they like, but then, uh, but don't, don't try. And convince everybody else in the world that they're a Ufo is just because this is what you believe. Don't. Why would that become your, your, uh, your mantra? Why would it be so important?

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       I think it's just like people that want people to convert to Islam, they just have this idea in their head that this is the truth and they have to pursue it. It's just like a religion. I think that the religion of belief, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the intensity of ideology. Once you know there's, I know people that want you to be on a t and t because that's their network know like, man, I want you to do with verizon and at and t there's a weird clan thing that human beings have and blackberry versus ipad and the people that believe in aliens, they all stick together. They go and they have conferences and it becomes a part of their culture. It's fun and there's this thing that happens, this confirmation bias where they don't want to look at anything outside of something that confirmed their idea. They don't want to look at it objectively. I think having a belief system is important. Did you see anything up there? Anything Weird? No lights

Speaker 1:          00:58:44       world is really weird to look at this. It's fascinating to look at in the storms around the planet and the, and the uh, I was out on a spacewalk going through the southern lights, you know, with the, with the Aurora, this case, Aurora Australis coming up underneath my feet for a thousand miles and that is a weird thing to see. It's beautiful. It's fascinating. It's, it doesn't green real it. Mostly what you see in pictures is green because that's what the cameras see, but in reality it's, it's got red and orange and yellow coming out the top of it so that your eyes can pick up and it's, it's a, you can't believe it's real. Like how could this possibly be earth? How can this be going on all the time? It's, it is phenomenal to see, especially when you can see for several thousand miles and it's under your feet. It's a, it's amazing to see. So yeah, we see amazing stuff all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:59:38       Yeah. That's way cooler than some dork in a flying saucer. It doesn't even have. He doesn't even have the manners to come and say hi. He's got a circle around and abducted you and erase your memory.

Speaker 1:          00:59:48       Me, the world is is fascinating and unknown and interesting enough with helping to invent little green men visiting
