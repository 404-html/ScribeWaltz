Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Tone, tone, tone down,

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       and we're live. Let's have a toast to hugh hefner. Yes. We lost one of the Great Dick slingers of the 20th century. Certainly did we lost him. He literally had a place where guys could go to be latches. Yeah. If you could just go and you had a mansion where everybody knew there was going to be a bunch of hoes and that's why they went. Yeah. They went there on purpose and it was guys that were notorious for hanging around the mansion for going to all the mansion parties. Did you ever go? I went twice. I went once for a marijuana policy project thing. I think that was the company that was putting it together. A or a hosted something and there was bands and stuff like that was kind of interesting. That's fun. And then the other time I went was for fear factor. We did something for fear factor with the playboy playmates.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       Do you have to meet? He'll. I never met him in. No, never met him. He's just, I think by that time he's. He's an old and I think he just wanted to chill. Yeah, he was just kinda done. I never went there. I tried to get into girl, tried to get me in and I guess they. They googled me and she goes, I guess I have enough credits. Oh, come on, sit. What it was I couldn't get in and she's like, they have to look you up. And she was nice, but they said no. How long ago was this? Probably two years ago. Oh my God. I know. I didn't qualify to go. Like I didn't qualify to go with his fucking girls and fucking crazy. You didn't have enough credits I guess sell or maybe they didn't have the right credits or maybe they just didn't care, like whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       You know what I mean? I didn't, I wasn't even that mad, but I was like, ah, whatever. How credits. Yeah. Oh, gross. Yeah, she said something like that, but she was trying to be really nice, like she was trying to let me down easy because she felt bad because we were friends since you wanted to go, like you just don't qualify to come here and look at these tits. Just really hurtful. It was a weird place because it was super outdated, like you heard about the grotto, the grotto, you go to the grotto and has a phone from like the 19 seventies there and you're like, what is this? They left it like for probably for the vibe, the old school vibe I guess, or they just never updated. It was weirdly, you know, he's sold the place or it was for sale, but one of the caveats of purchase was that he had to live in the building until he died.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       Yeah. Yeah. But it was like some preposterous amount of money, like $200, million dollars or something crazy. Well, the land is really valuable. So what do they do at that now? Do they knock it down? I mean, is there no nostalgia to it? Is it kind of died on the vine anyway? Or do you fucking shit? Well he has a son and his son probably inherited it. His son I think was running the magazine. They tried for awhile to have no nudity. Oh, terrible idea. It's like fucking mechanic fucking thing with no cars in it. Who wants to just read that shit? Stupid. It's like having a New York Times article with all ads. Like what do you. Where's the fucking intellectual stimulation here? You fucking idiots. That's a really bad note. Annuity is a terrible decision. Yeah. Well, they were always in this weird area, right?

Speaker 1:          00:03:09       Because Hugh hefner was like the only acceptable pornographer like Larry Flynt who did a lot for free speech, who did a lot for exposing corrupt politicians, but they would show vaginas and assholes and because of that he was always thought as a gross guy. Yeah. Well even their social commentary was. I remember when I was a kid, that was one it ma. Who is the feminist? Gloria? Gloria allred. Oh my God. I know and I think it was a gloria steinem parody, but it was like, you know, her licking the girl's pussy that had period blood. It was like some fucking viral thing. He would do the most viable political color. He really showed his disdain of those people. He was great. He's a crazy guy. He's still alive. That fucker. He gets shot, you know, and paralyzed like way back in the day, right? Yeah. Seventy seven maybe.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       Was it that lady? I think it was [inaudible] 76. Yeah. Yeah. He's still got a bunch of casinos and stuff. He still out there kicking it, but like who the hell is buying hustler? I'm, I a lot. It's funny you mentioned that. I had my manager got one today. I haven't bought one in many years because there's a. I did an interview for them and it was actually a really good interview and they quoted me accurately, so I'm in December's Hustler, which is after today. Wow. So it's funny. I bought a hostel for the first time probably in 15 years today. What magazines do that or December comes out installed. No, that's so fucking stupid. Why don't we pretend it's like new cars. It's a 2018. We'll have the fuck. Is that even possible since 2017 monkeys. I, it's gotta be something about the anticipation of getting it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       It's almost like when a halloween movie doesn't come out October 30th because you're sick of Halloween by then, so it comes out like you say September 15th and then by the time Halloween comes the movie's finished. You're like, oh, fuck. Halloween. No, but that makes sense because they're not pretending it's halloween. It's just a halloween movie. Right? Like they're pretending that's a December issue, but it's not decided. It's not. Yeah. I don't know the thinking. They come out like way in advance usually a month of before, but December. This is kind of the new car thing. It was always weird because it's way ahead. Six months. Yeah, like six, six months before the year turns over. They're already saying that it's a 2018 model, but it's like it's 2017. April when you're talking about is not the 2018 model. It's like weird. It's like tricks, you know, it's like when you buy something and it costs $9, 99 make it $10.

Speaker 1:          00:05:25       You Fuck? What is this? What does this penny stuff they want to say under $10? Yeah. I, I don't, I don't understand. It just looks better with the 99 then the Ta. I don't get it either, but it does for dumb people. Yeah. That's what it is. It's like you're. You're appealing to people's mind. Like the little part of their mind is trying to save a little better and better sound better. I don't know. I mean comedians have addressed the gas thing for years. There was a book about this. It's called predictably irrational. The hidden forces that shape our decisions. That came out about

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       10 years ago maybe. Interesting. So it's playing, playing on the irrational thoughts that we have about like specific anecdotes about like say like a best buy ad and why there's three. My washing machines and they're really trying to get you to buy the middle one, but they have two other priced ones goes into things just like that. All over different aspects of life. You all. My favorite ones are when you're in Vegas and you see voted Best Buffet, best 10:00 PM show like Pi. Who who voted for the best buffet? They did vote on it. Why? Who are they? Do they have to leave the house? Like, are you going to fucking buffet voters in 20 minutes? We're going to miss the buffet vote. Who Cares? But there is good buffets in bad buffet's right. Like, where's a good buffet and big. Do you ever go to the buffets?

Speaker 2:          00:06:43       I fucking love a good buffet if you want. The trophy is great rules. Nice. The Wynn hotel in Vegas has a tremendous buffet. Well, the wind hotels, tremendous. Period. I've walked through it but I've never stayed there. It's a phenomenal hotel. It's like a very high end place. So it makes sense that their buffet would kick ass in here in la. They have a good one, uh, at the um, the four seasons on Sundays as I might've said. Delight to buffet. Yeah. Oh, I've done the four seasons in Maui and they have a breakfast buffet. Oh, what a great way to get fat. It is, right? Oh, it's tremendous. They make you waffles. They have the waffle thing right there. Something about someone making you a wall when they pour the waffle stuff into that, a little press and put it down. You're like, oh, I'm gonna.

Speaker 2:          00:07:26       Have a waffle. I'm just thinking right now about melting the butter on it and before you know what I did last time I put peanut butter all over that motherfucker and then I put butter and then I put syrup. Yeah, I felt great for about 15 minutes and then afterwards I just want to. But you feel fucking terrible. Wow. Much as you work out. Like I'm surprised like you don't because you burn through everything you eat. Yeah, but you know what it is, man. It has nothing to do with that. It's an insulin pump. Your body just hits all that sugar into your system and you bought us like what the fuck is this? And it's actually probably worse for me because I don't do it very often. Like if your body gets used to sugar, if you're drinking sugary sodas all day and you're eating white bread all day and if your body gets used to processing that stuff, it has a better handle on what to do with it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       Whereas with me, it only gets it every few days. So when it gets it, it's like, what the fuck is this? Especially like if I overload, like get crazy, eat a banana split or something like that. Like Ah. You feel it? Oh yeah. I worked hard. I'm bad in la though with food. Like I fucking go out for Sushi and that, that yogurt stop on Santa Monica. It's my favorite place in the world was then cheese. No, it's called the yogurts dot. Oh, okay. It's on Santa Monica and I been there for days where I've been in La for four days. I've been there four times. I can't stop shoveling that shit and it's my favorite fucking place. Why is it so good? I don't know, man. I've had yogurt that was just as good. It just, I, I'd always felt right to go out for the best Sushi and then go

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       down there and have some yogurt. Stop. Treat yourself a little jimmy. You doing good with your life? Well, you know, I was having a sad day Monday and literally like a fucking fat girl. I got my ex girlfriend who's my best friend and we went and got yogurt. I'm like, I'm really sad. And we went and got. I treated myself to a little yogurt. I just go up and down. I'm just relationship nonsense. I'm a fatalist, but you're doing great. I will do it. Okay. Do you know how many people would fucking kill to be in your position? Successful touring, standup comedian? Sure. Assessable podcast or successful radio personality. Loved by all. Chip has a great podcast or that's who the successful podcast and the Norton Empire is. The fucking thing that you do with Matt said, Sarah, you guys have like the best mma podcasts in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:09:36       Thank you. We have a lot of fun with that, man. Thank you. It's great. I Love Matt. We talked about the last time. I love him too, but it's A. Yeah, it's one of those things where like, I know that and I know that it's a fun Gig and I love doing it, but it's one of those things. It's not about like feeling like I've been. I haven't been blessed like show business given me opportunities. I've failed, but I'm not some unlucky guy who, gee, they didn't give me a shot. They give me a million shots. It's about being annoyed at yourself for certain things, so it's not about like, I get a good apartment, I make money. I am very lucky, but it's the rational, like when you're feeling down, you're like a rational thing. No, you can't. You can't turn it around with your mind.

Speaker 3:          00:10:12       No, I'm too emotional. I react to emotionally, but the next day, like I had a great week since then get out because she and I talked and I realized I'm just being kind of fucking crazy girlfriends. Shit. Yeah. But I'm also not cheating, but I don't know how to not cheat so I'm not acting out. It's fucking crazy man. Oh, so maybe part of your weirdnesses like dealing with the fact that you're not expressing your normal behavior patterns? Yeah, it's giving up. It's like it's given you have a huge addiction. Like I still, I still look at porn and stuff, but not acting out. Not Having fucking girls. The La is a deadly city for me. Why do I come out here? I got him fucking not deadly pussy. Well, sometimes when I'm out here, I'm a very fresh boy. Very Naughty.

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       I behave better now. There's a whole ecosystem around that here. There really is a lot of gals that are a little loose with the sex and they've decided to profit off of that. Yeah. And they don't just have sex with some men and not have to work a job and some of them are literally just people I've known for a lot like there, like people you meet through the business and they're just as dangerous because. And I mean for me because they'll do anything. And uh, because they, they liked the fact that I'm open. So they're like, oh my God, guys think I'm crazy. Like, so it's hard just not to be unfaithful. It's hard to not be fucking [inaudible] fans are. I've been talking about this for a week. So I would up and down. I've had sad that I'm great and I'm just getting. I don't have a girlfriend in six years and I'm talking about it. And then one fans like, are we getting it? You're going to girl friend. You're 49, you're being normal. It's like, Jesus, you fucking rotten toad. Can I talk about my life being healthy for one week before fans get sick of it? Well, you're always going to get one person who complains about everything. Yeah. I can't really bother. You know, it's just like,

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       yeah, you're going to get that. I mean, and he's got a point two. It's probably annoying to him, which is why he said it, but she or she. Yeah. Well, shut her mouth. Fuck you. No Bitch. I gave her. I gave her a sarcastic apology. I was like, sorry, I didn't mean to share something good. Only keep it negative. And she actually went back. It's all good. Like she believed the apology. Oh, that's hilarious. Well, there's a fake feud going on between me and Ari and Bert Kreischer and Thompson and people for whatever reason think it's real and so they're getting mad that I'm airing out our dirty laundry in public, but I couldn't be more obvious about how fake it is. I even wrote, good day sir, at the end of my letter with all caps. I mean it's just. This is like a new thing. Pray for Joe.

Speaker 2:          00:12:38       This is what it is. Bert Kreischer, our friend, good friend. Bert is a fucking raging alcoholic. He certainly, he drinks six doubles a night. Yeah, he's drinking 12 drinks a night and I go, are you serious? He goes, every night. I go, wow, that is crazy. I can't even imagine doing that. That's incredible. So we said, do you think you'd get sober? He said yes. Okay. So then someone said sober and run a marathon. I was like, stop you guys. He's going to die. Yeah, because first of all, burt likes to pretend he runs, but he really only runs on a treadmill and I'm like, that is not running. You're lifting your legs up and the things coming towards you, it's not the same. So now we started running on the railroad and he's like barely getting in a couple miles and he takes a lot of breaks. He's not running any fucking marathons anytime soon and I'm certainly not saying that he could do one after a month.

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       Right. So we said, okay, how about no drinking for the entire month of October and you got to do 15 hot yoga classes in a month, which is fucking hardcore hardcore. I've done it. I love hot yoga, but it really does. Where it really wipes you out, it wipes you out. Especially if you're not used to it and you don't drink enough water, you've got to really be behind the ball. So everybody agreed to that and then a couple of fucking days ago they started saying, we're going to be totally sober. No weed, no alcohol. I go, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. First of all, you fucks. I'm only doing this to try to see if we can get burt soap. I don't need to not drink. I could not drink for months. It doesn't bother me. Like me taking a month off of booze. It doesn't bother me at all, but me taking a month off a weed is like, how do you expect me to write?

Speaker 2:          00:14:06       I, I use it to write. I use it to think about things. I use it to enjoy things. I use it as a like a sacrament almost. Do you ever think of trying a month without you knowing you're going to go back to it and that you're not doing a direct of it, but I know want to be bullied by a welcher yeah, no fear was supposed to see Burton. Tom had a fucking contest and they were. If they lost 25 pounds, it was supposed to take them on a trip to wherever they chose and Tom wanted to go to Europe to watch a soccer game and burt wanted to go to watch some crazy football game and already completely welch on the bed and then took off and went to Asia for four months and left me holding the bag. Not only did he take off, he took off and went off the grid and don't think the two aren't related shift fear.

Speaker 2:          00:14:49       I know what the fuck you're up to. You didn't feel any responsibility to pay that bet you son of a bitch. Anyway. I wound up getting them. What do I get them tickets to wake some basketball game. That game. Yeah, there's a big game, right? Yeah. So it was a big deal. Flew him out first class the whole deal, put them up in a nice hotel, paid for everything, so I paid for it and because they did actually lose the weight and so they're like, we gotta come up with a new test and somehow or another I got involved in Ra got involved too and they're trying to shame me into quitting pot. It's like I stopped smoking pot all the time when I go on vacation, I don't smoke pot for a week at a time when I go anywhere where I'm, you know, I, if I'm in Europe for 10 days, I'm not smoking weed.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       It's not an addictive issue, but it's something that I enjoy. I could stop doing things that I enjoy, but it sounds like an addict saying this, I don't have a problem with it, but I really don't have a problem with it. I like it. I like pod. I'm not willing to not do it for an alcoholic friend and a welcher and then thompson girls dressing up like a medicine man lately. Like what the fuck is he doing? He's wearing, he's wearing some crazy steven seagal outfit. He's got wooden beads on and shit and some crazy hat. Or they loose fitting clothes. What he's wearing. Yeah. No, no. He's in tremendous shape. Oh, good for Tom. Tom Lost the weight and kept the weight off because Tom is like really disciplined, you know, which is why he just did another netflix special and like three and a half, four years.

Speaker 2:          00:16:13       He's done three Netflix. Got. Yeah, he's a. he's an animal. There he is. Look at his hat. Just fucking hat. Jesus Christ. Wow. Nice beer too. Good frosting and the beard. Nice and trim. It looks good. I love it. But he's fucking healthy. Look up the thinness faces, but look at the picture above that. Above that. That one. See if we get a fucking outfit. Oh my God. Pete's the feathers and shit. Who Does he look like? Who Does that outfit look like? I've seen that photo shopped. I'm sure. What? What does that outfit from that looked like? It was weird. Who dresses like that? Likes the golf. It's looks like Steven Seagal to me. The smoke in the back. It could be like some Buddhist monk or something like that, but uh, these motherfuckers are trying to shame me and it's to quitting. We'd some happening for us.

Speaker 2:          00:16:57       In fact, I'm going to get high every day in October. You haven't thought of trying to just for a month to see it, to see how, like if it gets weird for you, it might be. You might get some really good shit out of it if you're cooling. Yeah, I mean I would, but maybe another month. Maybe I'll do it in November, November, but these, this month they can suck my dick. I'm going to get high every day. You won't be shamed into it. You'll do it when you want to do it. I'll do it if I want to do and if I really had an issue. If I'm like, man, I can't get a day without. If, if I felt like I was reaching for it to do things like I haven't smoked pot today. Today I went running to a podcast. I like to smoke a little weed before podcast, but nothing today. Nothing. Zero. No issues. Yeah. I think it would affect me differently. Have you ever used you as a good example of a guy like you? You function well, like you smoke pot and you do Jujitsu. Like I didn't do that well. A lot of people that do Jujitsu smoke pot, it's. It's huge and the Jiu Jitsu community you would think like a lot of people have a misconception of Jujitsu where they think of it as being a bunch of like

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       really aggressive, mean guys that are like attacking each other, but it's more much more bunch of really smart analytical stoner sensitive nerd type characters who are also like very strong because they do Jujitsu all the time or if they lift weights and get in really good shape. A lot of those guys, it's because of Jujitsu and then of course there's people that come to it from like football or wrestling or something like that. They have a different attitude, but a lot of times they fall into like a Jujitsu mindset which is a very relaxed, friendly mindset. Jujitsu people are super friendly, very affectionate to like all the guys that met very huggy and friendly and it's A. I have noticed a lot of combat athletes are like that, but there's a gentleness to it. Like we see Bernard Hopkins I've talked to a lot and when you.

Speaker 1:          00:18:35       He sits right next to you and literally he's a speed invade your space, but it doesn't feel menacing or, or weird. It feels like almost like he's just an affectionate, gentle guy until it's an odd feeling how you get energy from people and it just doesn't feel uncomfortable. Well, you know where the garlic Bernard, he's so confident in himself. He doesn't exude any insecurities or whiteness. I mean, he's an all time great period. There's no, there's not a single human being that knows boxing that would argue that Bernard Hopkins is at an all time. Right. I remember when he fought Tito Trinidad. You ever see that fight? He fought Felix Trinidad and I believe he was 36 at the time and Trinidad was in his prime and everybody really thought the Trinity. I was going to run them over and he beat the fucking shit out of Trinidad and it was a weird controversial fight because he was in Puerto Rico and he took the Puerto Rican flag and threw it on the ground and everybody went crazy and he wanted to kill him.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       Yeah. He wanted to get inside Trinidad's head and get them, get them to try to brawl with him. And he did. Bernard picked him apart. Well, he picked him apart and fucked him up and then years later when people wrote them off again, he fought Kelly pavlick and this is after Kelly pavlock and knocked out Jermaine Stewart and he was thought to be like the guy, you know, and everybody was like, Kelly Pavlics gonna fuck up or an art hopkins and Bernard Hopkins beat the shit out of him too. Who did finally knocked him his last fight that will smith. He was 51. Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I'm sure it was either 50 or 51. He wanted to be 50. I remember, I think he had 40, 49 fights or whatever. I know he wanted to fight when he was 50. He wanted to Fight Mayweather for his 50th fight.

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       That was. I remember him talking about that right before he turned 50. He was talking to her. Would never fight him. He's so much bigger. Yeah. I guess he was talking about cutting weight or maybe it was just saying that, but he talked about fighting floyd floyd coming up at him going down. If I was Florida, I'd say fuck that. The flight Pi did because he never fought him about. But I think that he was talking about that when he was 49. Yeah, because floyd is a tiny man. Yeah. I mean floyd is a natural 147 pound fighter. Like when he weighed in for the fight with conor, you weighed 1:49 and Bernard was fighting one 75. It's just so much larger. Yeah. Maybe he was talking about coming down and I don't remember the conversation, but obviously they would have had to have a catch.

Speaker 1:          00:20:42       Right. But he fought this guy, Joe Smith Jr, who's a young guy who's a murderous and he just got fucked up and not through the ropes and he fell on his head. It was horrible. Yeah. But he had such a great, huge bound to get, you know, he had to go down sooner or later. But uh, yeah, just uh, like a nice dude and uh, I love guys like that who don't try to give off just that shitty energy and I don't think I've ever gotten that energy off of fighters. Well you won't get it off the successful ones because to get successful you want to have as few things that are in your way that are cumbersome as possible. Few Ego issues and a few distorted perceptions of reality as possible in order to weave your way through to the top. Yeah. No, I mean there's exceptions to that where you have a phenomenal physical specimens that are incredibly dedicated and dealing with a lot of demons like Tyson in his prime, you know, but I don't know if that would work in them and may the same way it worked in boxing.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       Like I just don't know, with all the variables and boxing, like with Tyson or an mma rather with Tyson in his prime, he could just weighed towards God's Bob and weave and throw bombs and, and figure out a way to just smash them. He was just so much faster than everybody. And he hit so hard and they were afraid of him. Yeah. But I wonder if you're ever get to see that kind of person dominate the way Tyson did as a MMA fighter. Like I just don't know. It's weird. I never care what their face looks like when they walk into the ring. Like, you know, when you don't watch videos, like, Oh God, he looks frightening, but you've pointed it out and he chews gum. Annie's high steep and the Oj when he walks in, he couldn't look happier. Oh, was so calm. Josie.

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       Aldo won't look the guy in the eye. He's terrified. He's just kind of looking down and being humble, you know, none of that stuff seems to work with those guys because every one of them knows there's so many ways to lose. I don't know what it is, but they don't seem to try that shit with each other like boxers some guys do. It was a big thing with vandelay Silva, vandelay stair guys down big time, you know, and Mirko Cro. Cop in him had the greatest stare down the history of pride. They're just both staring at each other. It was super intense. I remember just like America when you talking about his stare, that's probably what every year he came over to. UFC was a 2008 when you were on our show on k rock and you talking about this Guy Mirko Cro. Cop was coming over at his fucking and we were watching his stare down.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       Look at this. This is Mirko versus vandal. Vandal used to intimidate everybody, but Mirko was the head of an anti terrorist squadron and Croatia, he didn't give a fuck. And he was a world class kickbox. So like, look how fucking intense lately on. He's completely unintimidated by that stare and he beat the holy shit out of Angela. He was the first guy to really flatline. Vandelay head kicked him into a coma. Wow. Yeah. Just blam it was, uh, the second time they fought, the first time they fought was his first mma fight and they had all these weird wacky rules like there can only be on the ground for 30 seconds and they had to stand in the back backup, right? Yeah. They, they hate Mirko wasn't really doing mma. I mean you've sort of training in mma, but vandelay was a champion. I mean Jay was a world class fighter and so they had some sort of a weird arrangement and the arrangement was like limited amount of time on the ground and bunch of other wacky rules in that first fight.

Speaker 1:          00:23:55       It was a draw because if no one finished anyone, that was the other thing. Nobody finished. Anyway. They decided that it was going to be a draw and the rounds were with a 10 minute rounds. Well back then they were 10 minute first rounds and then you'd have a five minute second round in a five minute third round if it was a championship fight. But I think with vander and him they, they shortened the rounds as well. I don't remember the whole deal. But then the second time they fought, it was a legit pride mma fight and Mirko had already fought a bunch of pride fights and really got into the groove and it become like one of the best heavyweights alive and he just beat the shit out of band that way. I've never seen that stare down. That was really intense that, that was an intimidating stare.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       That's Marco and his prime because it's moving, not moving. Yeah. But that you're right, if you're dealing with the team, you're the head of an anti terrorist. Uh, yeah. We've got police group. I guess there are police could have sounded more like a fucking, like my niece, the head of it police. But if you're like an antiterrorism cop, I mean that's the face you have. I mean, you have to get information out of people, but he's most likely seen a lot of people die, you think? Yeah. Yeah. Croatia is a hard place, man. I mean he's, he's a hard man in a hard place. And on top of being like a soldier, he was, you know, the best kickboxers alive before he wanted to mma. So yeah. Oh man, he was amazing. He was amazing. He was very good as a kickboxer, but really came into his own as a MMA fighter because his style of kickboxing was unique, uniquely effective in mma because he was very explosive and fast.

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       Whereas a, some guys would be like more, there'd be more methodical or technical, like Ernesto hoost or Peter or some of these other guys that would, they would stand in front of guys more and just pick their shots better. Mirko would just blast you with like one or one or two single shots. But that was way more effective in mma. Like the explosive really fast style. Yeah. I never thought I would like to see a, uh, a wonderboy, one of his kickboxing fights and he was like, like $57 a kickbox and I never watched him kickbox online. You can see them online. I should do that online because God knows what I'm doing. It's not helping me getting off. So yeah, I'm trying not to as much, but it's like there's so many fun things to watch. I've been think jerking off during the day because I, it's so ritualistic for me that when I jerk off during the day I'm like, ah, okay, I can be a person and I don't have to think about that for the rest of the day.

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       It really helps my day go much more productive. Have you ever taught a meditating? Do you meditate at all? No, I get it like, you know, uh, before the, the, the, uh, we started joe pointed. He's like, you always have an issue and he's right and that's like for me it will be an itch. What you were talking about some new issue with my throat, but I had that for years. We're starting certain foods fucked me up if that happens to me too though. Pot does that for sure. Really? Yeah, we smoke too much weed before a show. I'll get Flemmi. I think it's a combination of many coffee and eggs, like the eggs, I think do it. I went to one of these alternative doctors. I thought maybe my, uh, my uh, adrenal, adrenal glands were fucked up. So he's like, well you got to cut out the eggs or cut out the coffee and I can't stop with the krave.

Speaker 1:          00:27:01       Fruit's good for before a show like apples, you know, certain flux behind it. I went around the corner. I had one of those veggie thing, a pure vegetable juice, splitly, celery and a fucking vegetable just blows because it just dominates the entire juice. I hate it. It's great for cleaning out. Your system isn't really good for you. Oh, throws your fucking pipes free. Like celery juice is one of the best juices. Like if you have to take a shit, you know, I've been constipated except on a new medication that's supposed to cause diarrhea and I have been, I have not been shitting and I'm usually waiting on a medication for. I just want to call it, prep it so you don't get HIV and I'm negative. I know, but I need it now because I'm in a fucking relationship. But I started to take it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       I'm like, I'm just going to be smart because I'm a fucking smart to take a medication like that. Like isn't, aren't there like AIDS medications now? HIV medications are like completely stop it from there are, but you don't want to have it. I don't want to get it. Yeah. I don't want to get it. I mean I think I've only taken it for a little while and I'm probably going stop because I'm in the relationship and I got to go. They want you to be tested after a month and make sure that your blood is okay. Get livers. Okay. Your kidneys, they want to look you over. Yeah. Again, off that shit. Is it bad for you? I just got to imagine it is. Anything that. I mean, anything that gives you diarrhea? Well it's only for a few days but it didn't give it to me. It literally stopped me from shitting.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       Constipation. It did. Yeah, it did. Yeah. I just, uh, I mean, isn't that a thing with like vicodin and a lot of those pain killers? It gives you constipation? Yeah. I've only taken vicodin once, after I had my sinuses fixed, but the side, that prep I took it. I don't have any more than that. I like, I'm going to go back and see the guy and again, I don't even know if I'm gonna to do it again and take that shit. I just want. I was one point I was being crazy, so I'm like, I just want to make sure I don't get that. Yeah, you know, I would rather have some kind of a kid. I knew I wouldn't be on it forever, but I'm like, while I'm fucking acting like an ass, let me at least one of the podcast episodes that I took the most amount of heat for early in the day was I did a podcast with a guy named Peter Duesberg. He's a biologist at the University of California Berkeley, and he's a very respected biologist who's done a lot of great work on cancer, but he's got a very controversial take on HIV and he does not believe that HIV causes AIDS. He thinks that HIV is evidence of a weak immune system.

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       Excuse me. And he thinks that when people have HIV, it's because their immune system is compromised. It's not that HIV compromises their immune system. Oh, okay. And he feels like all these people that are catching aids and getting, uh, HIV, what's happening is they're doing a lot of party drugs, they're doing emile and crystal

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       meth and that's very, very prevalent inside the gay community, you know, gay guys party a ton, right? And they're, they're doing a lot of drugs and he points to the high correlation between all these people doing these party drugs and HIV. His work is widely criticized amongst legitimate scientists and most people just do not agree with him. And they said that the, um, the connection between HIV and AIDS is rock solid and undeniable. But he thinks it's not in. It's an boy. Did people get mad at me about that one? I'm, I'm just talking to this guy who's a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley. I mean, I'm figuring this guy's legit scientist, but he can't get funding for anything. He's essentially blackballed from the academic community. And it was really weird talking to them. It's like, has anybody debated you? And he's like, no, no one will debate me.

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       You know, is it, is it almost like, um, what about Arthur Ashe? Or is he saying that a direct injection into the bloodstream will give it to you? How does he explain those? Well, I don't know what Arthur Ashe was doing, but what he was saying essentially was that transfusion. I think you got it. One of the things about HIV was if you got HIV, Arthur Ashe got a transfusion. For what reason though? Oh, I don't know. I'm not your thing. He had something wrong. Right? When what he's saying is that when your immune system is compromised, that's when HIV shows itself that HIV is a very weak virus and that it only shows up in the immune systems of people that are compromised and that. Is he saying we all have it or you can catch it like, no, he's not saying we all have it, but you saying you can catch it, but he's saying the evidence of it is only in people that have a weakened immune system.

Speaker 2:          00:31:20       Again, I'm just not something I believe in. Gentlemen. Don't get mad at me because I'm white or you know, there's so many. I think there's a million different cases of people who obviously were, you know, who got it in in very weird ways are again, two blood transfusions or they were born with it. But here it says, Arthur ash says he believed he contracted HIV, the virus that causes AIDS through a transfusion of tainted blood during his second round of heart bypass surgery in 1983. First learned of his inspection. Now here's the other issue that I'm Peter Duesberg was saying was that what they were giving people when they first tested positive for HIV was act. That act is a medication they used to use for chemotherapy, but they stopped using it for chemotherapy because it was killing people quicker than cancer was killing people. I mean, it was just a brutal, brutal drug and they had a bunch of it in his mind.

Speaker 2:          00:32:12       They had a bunch of it laying around after that and they decided to try to use it on aids patients and they started reading re, uh, in, you know, reintroducing it and you wonder. I guess the conspiracy thing is I take pharmaceuticals. We had all these drugs and they wanted to get rid of unneeded or do they think that hey, they were just trying to do something else. I mean, obviously it wasn't the smart thing to do because they don't use it anymore and it didn't help people act did not help people with aids. I mean, people who took azt died, lot of them, shitload

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       of them and aids back then was essentially a death sentence, but there was a lot of people that didn't do anything that got aids that got HIV. It never got aids. They just took care of their body and it took a holistic approach and using nutrition. And I, I just think it's super controversial, like anything else. I mean there's people that get cancer and don't die. They get cured of it. Sure. But then there's people that get cancer at ravages are system and kills them. So Steve Jobs, I mean, he listened to people. I think he didn't try like alternative met Steve Jobs should still be alive. He had, like they said, a pretty curable form of cancer. You can get pancreatic. Uh, no. I thought he, I thought his was, they said a fairly curable one, that he had listened to his friends and tried to go so holistic and they said if he had gone and just had it treated, he probably would've survived it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       Well, those was probably a lot of that going on. There's always a lot of fucking wacky people with their wacky ideas about holistic medicine. Did. I saw a guy do a ted talk on basically saying like strawberries are really good because they caused other anti angiogenesis or something, which is about. It stops the production of new blood vessels and that's what feeds cancer. Like he had this. He literally had me convinced you could eat fucking strawberries and I kicked cancer in large quantities. So I mean if you hear somebody talk who really knows what they're talking about, even if they're wrong, a lot of people are convinced by. Well that's one of the problems with like youtube videos, right? Where people have wacky conspiracy theories as long as they speak with big words and I say things in complete sentences and they sound articulate. You start to believe them.

Speaker 1:          00:34:06       Don't. The one thing that has been proven to be effective with cancer, some forms of cancer is ketogenic diets. Diets where your fat based, where you eat a lot of Avocados and coconut oil and your body Burns those rather than glucose and some cancers feed off sugar, so to starve them, you go on a very low sugar diet and a very high fat diet and apparently there's real science that shows that there's some benefits to that, but so there's only certain kinds of cancers, certain kinds of cancers. It doesn't affect at all. Certain kinds of brain cancers. It doesn't affect it all. It doesn't matter what the fuck you do. You better go to a doctor. Yeah, I mean he can do both. We want it to go to the doctor and try some of that, like having another coddling under the fucking hospital. You have to choose what we about to say.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       Jamie, what I just googled on the Steve Jobs thing is like both of you are actually correct from what I just found that he had pancreatic cancer, but he also could have been saved potentially, but then the next thing also says that, uh, he lived for 20 years with it. So, uh, he didn't have chemo or radiation. They, uh, swayze a pancreatic and died within 18 months. Oh, they're saying that the, the, the, uh, the, the treatment killed him or are there different kinds of pancreatic cancers? Stupid. Lately it isn't there. There's a Hodgkin's and non Hodgkin's lymphoma one is worse than the other, but that bag up please Jesus Christ and said, Steve Lived for 20 years of this cancer. It seems he did not have chemotherapy or radiation treatment at all. The Hollywood actors who's at answering this? This is what is this, this bullshit? See, by the way out, go up there right there.

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       Walter Isaacson, he's writing the Steve Jobs biography. He told 60 minutes that Steve refused what could have been potentially a lifesaving surgery, but he did have more than one surgery, right? Didn't he have his liver replaced? Whereas I feel like he had a liver transplant. What is it that makes a guy not want to surgery? That might work, like do people become delusional in that they're that or are they afraid of the surgery? Are they willing to die? Like fucking Zappa hated going to the doctor and he died lose he 56. What was wrong with Zappa when he. It was a cancer I want. I was just calling cancer or prostate. The surgeon who gave Steve jobs a new liver and two more years faces new questions. That's a 2013. What does it say? It says he bought the Memphis House with job convalesced. What? He later bought the Memphis House. He bought the house where Steve Jobs was living there.

Speaker 1:          00:36:32       They said the guy who was treating George Harrison board on guitar to sign while he was in the fucking hospital. Sign this real quick. Yeah. Yeah. Revelation came with the end of the southern transplant Mark Buba Bulls. Say that name. Peruse squeak per, per uh, weight a rescue pressq , a Poreska Presca front page story. Rewey R, r u, S Q, u I n a front page story Thursday in the Memphis commercial advocate piece paints a vivid picture of the life saving operation, although it takes most of the details about jobs from the Walter Isaacson biography and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So why, what is the question? How did jobs move to the top of the list? Oh, it's one of those things. It's like Frank Underwood and the fucking. Yeah, why don't we probably paid somebody. Jesus, how the fuck do you think he gets to the top of the list when you have $50, million dollars you can move around yet when the way you are emailing is because of something you've invented, you'd probably get to the fucking top of the list. Fast wonder what killed his liver. I wonder if it was medication, like medication for. I know a friend who just died from pancreatic cancer and he had it for quite a few years. I met him.

Speaker 1:          00:37:44       I met him in 2014 and he already had it and he just died. It says he uh, refused. Tim Cook's liver transplant offer because he has the same rare blood type of Sim. Wow. Whoa. Tim Cook would have given Steve Jobs or a chunk of liver boy. That's tense than anyone's ever taken over the company. Hey, whoa. Yeah. What are you must have been? Yeah. If you want to give you a moisture liver, I wouldn't get my boss a hat. Yeah. Could you. I guess the. Obviously they were good friends. Can you imagine? That's intense, man. Your liver is something that regenerates hospital where jobs received transplant was given $40,000,000 by him. Wow. That's how you do it. Yeah. I guess he was appreciated. Let's look. That's how you get to the front of the line. What do you think the lines are supposed to be? Fair. You fucks.

Speaker 1:          00:38:28       This is a way to cut 40 million, 40 million declan cut. Yeah. You give some money to the hospital. It's probably going to save a shitload of lives. We went to before you came. Here we are at my. My radio agent died of cancer. He was like 64, 65. It was not that old and he had a cancer of the lymph nodes and he fucking was getting a little bit better, we thought and then went for surgery for circulation between these people in these super high stress jobs like agents. It can because I know stress by Bob was not as stressed guy though, unless he swallowed all that. He was a very calm guy. Like literally he was gentle and he gave you bad news gently but firmly. Um, he was a very, very unique guy. He was not stressed and less. He swallowed it and never showed it, but he, he seemed like a very zen guy.

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       Um, and it was something with his, uh, went in for a breathing thing and just died. I guess I'm definitely on the table and I don't have the details. Fuck man. But yeah, he was not that old. I mean it was 64 when you have. I'm 49, so when you just, almost 60 foil, that's fucking, that's a, a graspable age. I wonder like, you know, obviously there's so many different factors that play into like the lifespan, the difference between lifespans today. Life Spans 100 years ago, 200 years ago, and obviously there's been some big advances in medicine, but I wonder like how much our diet plays on the, the amount of cancer. I mean it's kind of a huge factor. All his sugar, all the bullshit people eat all the preservatives, smoking, pollution. They say that just living in a city can take up to 10 years off your life.

Speaker 1:          00:40:00       That's also probably like, it's probably the air and it's probably, it's probably the stress too because people in the city or just stressed. Yeah, I'm sure all that stuff goes into it. I mean we try to avoid it, but I try to eat healthy like grilled chicken, but a fun one. I never took into consideration until just a couple of years ago. I read an article on the effects of brake dust. Like when you're around a high population area and people constantly hitting their brakes. Really? Yeah. When you're in traffic all the time, those breaks when you, you know, you're cleaning your wheels and you get that break shit all over your wheels. Sure. That stuff's in the air. That black sooty shit. That shit gets in the air and if you're in a place like say if you're in Manhattan and you got like a second floor, walk up your windows open, you're just taking in breakdown.

Speaker 1:          00:40:47       You're breathing that in all the time. He'll wipe it off your fucking furniture and shit. You'll, you'll see it on your table. It's something that never, no one ever thinks I'd be there. Like I've never heard anyone discuss brake dust, but it is something that's all over the place. Well we find dust back there jamie. Like what is that dust that we keep finding back there? It's all black. It's probably just like La dirts because it's dry and dusty around, but it's black that I see it in my house too, but I mean back there, it's weird because we have a closed garage door just comes in under the air. We have this workout equipment and when we wiped the workout equipment, like if we go back there right now and put a wet paper towel to that, a reverse hyper machine, the top event, it's all black, like black dust.

Speaker 1:          00:41:28       Wait, there's stuff behind that. Yeah. There's a whole warehouse back. As many times I've been this room, I thought this was the entire room. I had no idea what a cool fucking sectional that is dead. There's a room back there and there's another room behind it. Oh, okay. Scientists find new ways of freeways are trying to kill you. What is it saying that the thickening progressing twice, the average in people living within 100 meters of a freeway, the connection between particulate matter and artery thickening were statistically significant for some groups. Yeah. That's what they're talking about. That's brake dust and shit that's coming out of exhaust pipes according to La Times. One point 5 million people live within 300 meters of a freeway and the La Basin. Last year we found out the freeway pollution travels much further than that. As much as 2000, 500 meters from the source. Fuck all that, so if you're now I wonder if it's the same in Manhattan. I'm sure it is, but. Or maybe because Manhattan has already play. Have a lot less cars going by your street and Manhattan than you do. They're 2,500 meters as far. How far is that in like feet or miles?

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       Is that a mile? A mile? A mile or kilometer? That's two and a half kilometers. That's fucked man. Everybody a mile from the highways getting poisoned. Jesus, you'll hope it, but how old is that studying? Is it still happening as much like our. Our break, our breaks made me better now than they were a few years ago. That's the same thing. No, the same thing. Those 2010 breaks at the same. I mean there, there's no different. They, they're, they're the same fucking things. They've always had these pads. They press down, they were out. You got to replace them and when they're wearing out there grinding down, that powder isn't going anywhere. Right? Someone should probably figure out a way how to contain that mean. That seems like what we're doing now is it just, it just goes out into the atmosphere. Maybe they should be contained, like where the powder, the brakes would work the same way, but the powder would have to be like sucked up into some sort of a pouch or something and you have to change it like a filter.

Speaker 1:          00:43:25       How often would you have to change it? Probably all the time, but that seems like that would be like a real viable alternative, like some sort of encased break thing. You know what I mean? That doesn't seem like outside of the realm of engineering, what can they make the breaks, if that sounds unfeasible, can they make the breaks out of something that's actually just not as bad for you? Is there anything they can do that might be a little bit of a fix, but I think anything you breathe in, you breathe in Sawdust and sucks for you. It's a particulate matter like you're taking in things and you're taking a certain kind of dust into your lungs and it becomes an irritant, so it's not good. Not good, Jamie. Wow. A sad, sad for all those people that live near the highway. Well, they live near the highway and I have my lifestyle, so I guess we're all going to fucking dropped that a little earlier than we showed this.

Speaker 1:          00:44:10       And you don't have HIV. No. Keep a rubber on. You're going to be fine. Don't anybody come in your butt and everything's gonna be okay. It's just fucking what a party killer. I know I've got a lot of rules, but no condoms. No, I can't wear them. Oh, well that's going to be a problem. It's definitely a problem. My fucking Dick shrivels. How many guys have gotten aids from regular sex though? Probably very few. Very few probably, but should have it. I'm sure. I'm sure it's somehow physically possible, but you probably have to have so many things lined up to get it from fucking pussy or even fucking ass. You have to have so many things. I'm sure it can happen though. Yeah, well it's. It's the issue is it has to get into your body, but I know that people get sick all the time from having a cut and then I'm getting someone's blood in their cuts, like that's happened to people in hospitals that have done surgery and cut their finger while they're doing it and they get infected by the blood of someone else.

Speaker 1:          00:45:04       That's common. Right. So it's got a little cut on your Dick. I remember when I had that thought, I've told the story of Hbo Special. I had three similar Ron Jeremy after the porn awards. It was, yeah. Was. It was fun. It didn't feel necessarily sexy, but it was fun. Yeah, it was just. Yeah, it was a Goof, you know, it's like a girl and he's fucking her. So he went into the bathroom. He was fucking one girl and he fucked another one and he, I remember he put rubbing alcohol around his dick and I don't know if that's that good for you, but I think he was doing to make sure he didn't have a cut, but he only did that before he fucked her. I think. I think alcohol or something. Yeah, to make sure that it was cleaning the window. Cut set is so hard core.

Speaker 1:          00:45:36       It is. But you know, his Dick has probably seen a lot of action and it might be a way to keep things off it. Yeah. If that guy doesn't have aids, who the fuck is getting aids? You know about that. You're not lucky. I'm a lucky guy. Lucky. Terrible now. Yeah. I mean think about that. If that guy doesn't have aids, fuck yeah. I mean I do realize I've rolled the dice way too many times and I'm like, I'm lucky that I'm really grateful. Like a fuck man. You just stop. Well it's also your uh, you know, it's just think it's harder to get like for a man than it is for a woman it seems like unless again, you let somebody come in here, but yeah, that can be harder. I think it's harder to get, but he didn't know. What am I at Dr.

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       No, but you're right. I think it is hard. It's hard to go fuck without a rubber right now because Rogan. Tessa. No, but I think you're right. It probably is harder to get unless you have a cut on your Dick and she's cutting her pussy and they happen to just go air tight against each other. I mean, come on. Yeah. For a woman like you gotta, think like all there, everything's exposed, right? All that area inside their vagina is all open tissue. Right. It's all like absorbing like they have the worst situation set up, but I think the air. I was told years ago by a woman who worked in the health field that it's such a. it's such a delicate virus that if you like, she's like a blow job. You won't even get it from. She's like, because you're, your stomach kills the semen. She's like, you.

Speaker 1:          00:46:58       You can even give him a blow job. Which I don't know how true that is, but she called me that fucking. She lives in Elkton, Maryland. I remember she was a really cute girl. I met at a road gig. I remember the fucking town she lived in. She was telling you this before. She blew you and don't worry about it. Yeah, don't worry about it. Stomach acid. Swatch glow. Yeah, she was really, she was a wonderful health practitioner. She's fucking drink about a gallon of seeds and tell me we're all going to be fine. Elkton Maryland. Good girl. Isn't it crazy though that so many diseases kill people from sex? You mean syphilis, gonorrhea, those are those fatal without, you know, like that's isn't syphilis would killed Al Capone? Um, I think so. Yeah. I believe we even did, but in the twenties there was nothing they could do for.

Speaker 1:          00:47:40       Right, right. Yeah. But I mean, it's just amazing that untreated so many diseases turned me. Think about how few things other than like severely compromised immune systems that get hit by the flu. You know, the people that die from the flu, usually it's old people or young really young people that are kind of frail. They wind up getting sick and dying from common colds and things along those lines. But most people they get better from it. Can you imagine shooting cancer out of your Dick? If for that was like fucking a, that would be like, that's where we have a problem. If you could, if you could give somebody cancer sexually, and I know they say oral sex and throat cancers possible, well HPV, human papilloma virus can give some women ovarian cancer or you can get it in your throat if they have it from eating pussy.

Speaker 1:          00:48:23       Well, isn't that what the Michael Douglas thing was? They said that fucking Catherine Zeta Jones put the Kibosh on that rubber. She was like not true. Plus we're getting a divorce. Oh yeah, man. She must have been when he was. He went out and started talking about that and they're like looking at her pussy. That must have been so annoying. You know Michael Throat cancer and oral sex photo of him. If I get. If you google throat cancer and oral sex, Michael Douglas comes up. That's got to be a bummer. Yeah, so he could probably should have kept his mouth shut about that, but she did. She was like, it. Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she suffering from some serious mental illness, like some, some ruthless bipolar type shit? No, I don't know. Yeah, I think Catherine Zeta Jones is pretty open about mental illness. I didn't know she was.

Speaker 1:          00:49:05       It's not surprising that somebody that hot like there's always a price to pay. Yeah, there's always, you know, you date someone that beautiful that her now her private struggle struggle. Catherine Zeta Jones bipolar disorder. Well, you know it's true because it's in people celebrity. Yeah. They always get to the bottom of post. Yeah, she's too hot. That's the problem. Nature just gives her a fucking curve ball. Know you want to be hot. How bout a little crazy to be this beautiful and you're gonna. Want to hang yourself during a second commercial. Here you go. Fucking get this. She says, I torture. My husband had a tough few years from her husband's cancer to and public battled bipolar disorder. Now the Hollywood stars back with a new film and film. Not, not really new article because she's kind of vanished off the face of the map. Yeah. You gotta wonder like when people.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       There's. I was looking at some pictures the other day of a, some movie star that I forgot who his name was, but he was in a ton of movies and that. Oh, the guy that was in platoon with scars all over his face. Tom Berenger, Tom Berenger, and then just finished. You know what he kinda did man, and I don't know why he did a couple. We have been a school teacher. There's nothing worse than the white school teacher in the black school. We get it. We get at. You're rescuing them fucking Hollywood assholes. Michelle pfeiffer and how great was she in dangerous minds mentally? Gangster's paradise was the theme song and she was going to go in there and with that bad accent and she was. It was funny. She was. This is why

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       people feeling like their music was getting lame where I think it was Bob Dylan lyrics she was teaching the young roughy ins with. That's like desperate white people wanting to go like, look, black guys. Our stuff's cool, and they read the lyrics. I'm like, Oh shit. These are troubled times. You don't fucking luck. That was strong as I could be. That's what it is. They can. We check that. If it was a bucket, Dylan's over. Shoot a homeboy. Oh my God. She wrote that down on. Who should you shoot, Catherine? Her fucking handle. She looks like Gilbert grape with that heritage. She was really hot, but not in that one. Yeah, and she had a leather jacket on the show. She was hard for even indoors. Who wears a leather jacket? She was not. Her accent was not good gangster. What was the accent? It was southern, but it kind of went back and forth. Know she was from Tennessee or fucking word Boston. When they keep. I think they make a decision one day. The first day of shooting is 40 minutes into the film, Forty minutes off you go deep into the movie. That's the first day of shooting and then they start somewhere else. They changed the accident and it just changes by the time they get the 40 minutes in the elevator picture of her with coolio.

Speaker 3:          00:51:36       Coolio. One fear factor. Did he really? Yeah, and he was so high. I mean so high. I would open up his trailer door and just get a fucking ferocious contact high just from opening the door. I was like, what? I A Canadian guy. Well, I don't. I don't know. I did. What you would call it, Mark Marin had a show called, nevermind the buzzcocks and one of the guests on there was coolio when I did with Monday wonder Mike from the sugarhill gang. Coolio. Nevermind the buzzcocks might. Yeah, Mark Marin. It was a British show and Mark Marin hosted it here in late 2000 and he was one of the guests that uh, and he, he loved me. We had so much fun and I saw him years later and he had no memory that we'd ever met. So he did. He loved it. He literally, I told him he literally gotten the knees and was bowing to mix.

Speaker 3:          00:52:20       I said something fucked up. So he was just enjoying it. So I'm like, the guy will definitely remember me, like fucking dumb slick rick. I brought him on stage at the comedy cellar one time we took a photo together. I saw him years later in the airport, nothing like, how do you not remember being on board on the stage from the audience if I was watching a show and they brought me up on stage, man, he was like, Dylan picture. So a lot of those guys and meet, they meet so many people that they're, they're hard drivers is constantly full. They're just constantly deleting files, which is understandable. It was just the circumstances that were weird, like not, not the fact that it was like me, like I've interviewed people and they don't remember me, but I get that because I've done radio shows and I don't know who the fuck you are 10 minutes later.

Speaker 3:          00:52:58       Oh yeah, yeah. You and slick rick at the, one of my favorite photos in history, he was in the audience and none of the comedians would talk to them, so I was going to always tell them I loved them and I'm like, I'm taking a photo with you after the show. And Manny and the owner was in there and he goes, oh man, he was so great and so fucking ridiculous. Did he get shot in the eye or something? I don't know how he's. I believe he got shot or he did something like that was in a children's story. Like there was something similar in his real life when you went to jail like that, that rapid children's. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       but I don't know exactly how he's island. I thought maybe he, I thought he had an interesting story for that, but maybe he didn't. I interviewed coolio before he won fear factor and the last 31 he was telling me that this is already over. He's already done this. He's lived a thousand lives and a thousand universes and he was just so barbecued. It was like inspirational. Wow. Was I was listening to him. I was like Whoa. But because he was so high, like I think it just had no nerves going in. He just sort of did the event. Like it was nothing on afraid. Yeah. Completely have some balance thing. I forget what it is. They were on some beams or some shit. So fucking amazing. Nobody died doing that show. I look back at it sometimes and I just go, Ooh, like do it again with another host.

Speaker 1:          00:54:08       Yeah. With a ludicrous. That's right. Ludicrous is doing it. They did it once. I don't know if they're gonna keep doing it. Apparently it was kind of a flop. What does it mean you don't want to? Because when it was done it was very timely, but now with the Internet has gotten so much faster and we can watch everything on our phone. It's kind of like you could see real life deaths. Yeah. So it's Kinda hard to see people doing crazy stuff when you can turn it on and just see someone do it without a shell around. They just doing it. Well. It's also the did it without the original production team and the original production team, they, they, they cut the budget substantially so it looked kind of cheap. And then the Stents, warren is dangerous. Like the original production team, they were wizards.

Speaker 1:          00:54:46       I mean they were really good at that kind of show and they did 148 episodes of the first season and then we came back. We did six more. So there was a. I mean they had just massive amounts of experience and putting together like the stunt people, the stunt people, beast on. It's where all the gross things, like all that stuff was. I think they didn't do any gross stuff this time around. The lawyers got involved. They probably now is corporate. The lawyers will quietly, you know, and then they were like worried about lawsuits in no matter what you signed, they're still going to do. So the lawyer probably chopped lot lie that shit out or they couldn't get insurance. Well with NBC, the second interrail iteration of fear factor and be like, what was it, like 2012 or something like that. And we did it again.

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       Two Thousand Eleven, 2012 when we did it again. They were often, I think it was 11. They did it. It was off the deep end. Scary. Like they went way too far. Yeah, it was dangerous. I thought it was dangerous. Like some of the stuff they were doing, we're like so much more intense than the stuff that we'd done before. I'm like, this is fucking. We could. Someone could get hurt here. Did you not want to do it after that? A second season of the new iteration. And you said when do it? Well, they canceled it because people had a drink. Come. Why that should have automatically got to the second season. That's what got to cancel. They play. They played horseshoes for donkey come. Yeah. They were throwing horseshoes and in no matter what you had to drink. Some come like if you landed a perfect ring toss and then you only had a drink that a couple of ounces. But these drinks, these dudes were drinking beer steins have come. Wow. Why they can't with his complaints or the network go. They went too far. I'm TMZ got

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       ahold of footage and they put an NBC passed on. I mean they, they, they passed. They said okay to all these guns. Right. So they, they, they cleared all of the ridiculous stunts that they wanted to do and this was the most ridiculous. Like getting people to drink, come on television. Yeah, that's rough. Well, it was just like, it's so over the top and that's the idea was that they couldn't have fear factor the way they used to have it before they had to be. It had to be bigger, badder, crazier a fear factor. And so the second version of it was just completely over the top, a little too much and they pushed it too far and too gross people out. Yeah. They drank donkey pis and donkey come and it was twins. So one twin had a drink. The Pis, she's drinking piss and the other girls drink come. Wow. Mug a Mug of coffee. Oh my God, what a great girlfriend. She must be though. Fucking ace. You know what's interesting? A lot of the girls wanted a drink to come rather than drink the pice. Of course they have experienced with it. They, they, the pisses a grocer thing come. They're like, all right, come. It's not great, but I've drank it and that guy drank. Come and look at it. They're hugging. They've got on their shirts.

Speaker 2:          00:57:35       It was deep, man. There's only been two times ever in the history of the show where I said to the producers, Hey, don't don't do this. And that was one of them. You said they shouldn't do it. I said, it's too much. It's just too crazy. Oh my God. That's a lot of calm. The shot. Come look at her, chugging it down. Oh my God, Amanda and chugging a town with me. My fucking stupid big head hovering over you telling you to do. You were encouraging her to do anything. It's like, you know, I mean I wanted her to win. I wanted, I wanted them all to win. It's part of the problem with doing that show. You liked them? Well, yeah. I mean hopefully you wanted people to, to, you know, I was like a coach or a motivational speaker as much as I was telling him you can do it.

Speaker 2:          00:58:15       Why did you get in their head? And you just tell them like, look, you just put one foot in front of the other and just don't, don't entertain any thoughts of quitting because a lot of quitting is just in your mind. A lot of quitting is just your mind saying, man, we can't do this, man. We should find a way out, man. Fuck this. This is just too uncomfortable. Whereas if you can just force yourself to push those aside and don't entertain those thoughts at all, you can get through a lot of things. You can't get through. Yeah. Yeah. That's the hard part is when you start telling us. It's almost when people push themselves. I remember Matt Serra was actually talking about Ray Longo and the way he'll push you past what you think you can go, but my problem is I'll stop, but I think I have to stop, but I guess there is this stuff in the reserve tank, but it just feels like there's nothing there, but it's a mind set.

Speaker 2:          00:58:57       It's like if you get your mind accustomed to convincing your body, the enough is enough and then you start entertaining those thoughts and thinking of those thoughts more than thinking about concentrating on the task at hand. You start thinking about, boy, if I just quit now, I can quit all this uncomfortable feeling will stop all this. A heaving of my breath or burning of my legs or whatever it is that you're doing. That can all stop. All the nervousness can stop. Like you see a lot of times before fights. Um, we've had several instances over the course of the history of the UFC. Most of the time it doesn't happen, but several incidents where people get anxiety attacks and you could attribute that to a lot of different things, right? You could say, well, some people just have anxiety and well, what is an anxiety attack?

Speaker 2:          00:59:43       Well, some people believe that a lot of what's happening is the mindset that you're entering into a fight with and that you're allowing your mind to just sort of run rampant rather than corralling it and channeling your mind into very distinct pathways like very distinct pathways of only beneficial thoughts and you will vacillate and deviate from those thoughts, but always bring it back to those very important thoughts and to have some sort of a mantra like you are here to do your very best. That's it. And all thoughts of quitting. If your body fails on you, that's one thing, but let it fail. Don't, don't, don't entertain those thoughts. Oh my God, now it's time to quit. Don't quit, don't quit. Don't entertain those thoughts. And there's a guy named David Goggins we've talked about on the podcast almost too much, but he's a very famous endurance athlete who's a, um, things navy seal and he, uh, has the world record for the most amount of Chin ups in a day and you know, some insane amount.

Speaker 2:          01:00:42       Right? He's doing, he will do sets of five where he does five Chin ups and he does them over the course. It was over a thousand. Right. But he does way more than it was 2000. Yeah. That way it doesn't burn his arms out and, but how long they take taken between fillon and it takes a little break, you know, do five, take a little break, relax a little, do another five, take a little break, relax a little bit back again. And he's, he attempted it more than once because one time we did it as a forum tour. Thousand and 12. My God. Yeah. So that guy, one of his statements is most people quit it 40 percent. Most people quit at 40 percent of what they're capable of. Really? Yeah. And I think that's absolutely accurate. Yeah. I, I, um, I think about that all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:01:27       I think about all the time when I'm on a hard run, you got to know when you're running like hills and particularly got to know when you're just fucking exhausted and you're running the risk of falling down and you really can't breathe right? Like you're, you're really pushing it because particularly things like sprints or hill sprints, you will reach an aerobic threshold. You'll reach a place where like, you really can't go any further. You're, your heartbeat is 185 beats a minute. You can't do it. Yeah, you're, you're, you're blowing your shit out. I mean, you're going to fail. But like when is it failing and when are you quitting? Because there's some uncomfortable moments where my heart's like 150, a hundred 60, where if I was feeling like a pussy, I'm like, let me just take a break here and breathe, you know, which is what Bert Kreischer does. Yeah, he probably has. It's a lot of. It's mental. So you think he's just quitting? Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. Dot you though, because you feel like your is telling you like I'm on the treadmill,

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       I can't do much. Like Ah, exactly. Can't do it. It's fucking boring too. That's why I like running outside. I don't like running. I think running on a treadmill would be great if you had a fucking awesome movie in front of you. Say if you were watching platoon and you're running on a treadmill and it's right in front of you or apocalypse now and you're listening to it. Yeah, I mean you can get into it, but I like running outside because I know where I'm going and it's part of the goal. Like I, if I reached this peak, that means it's a mild one point six miles and then another one point six back. Can you run farther in real life or on a treadmill? I don't run on treadmills. Are you? But if you had to like, wait, which one could you do a more on a trip?

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       You can. Oh, for sure. 100. First of all, the way I run, I'm running all hills. Like I don't really run flat when I'm running flats for very short periods of time. It's only flat in between hills. Uh, I fucking hate hills there. They're terrible. But here's the thing, I kickbox box yesterday for the first time in months I hadn't done any, any pad work, any bag work, anything like that. And I was going through rounds, like it was nothing. It was crazy. Like it was so different than cardio is better. Oh my cardio's way better just from running these hills because I do it. I'm committed to doing it twice a week. I try to do it three times a week, but I'm committed to doing it twice a week. So I did it today and I did it Monday. How long does it take you to run the hills and our, my workouts and our.

Speaker 1:          01:03:41       Okay. It was fucking brutal dude at the end of last several pounds of water completely exhausted and drained. But when I do other stuff I have way more endurance and I feel great after like right now, like I'm so relaxed, like after that happens, you just feel so good. Like you feel like, like regular life is not as, it's just not as hard because the running is so difficult. I should try that. You know, I fucking hate running so much but I'm so bored in the gym. But you live in Manhattan, but there's still the park. I mean it's kind of, there's this little place that you could run them but you're not running, you know, you know what you should do. I mean that's nothing. There's nothing wrong with that. I mean running is definitely a good thing as long as you're doing it the right way and running on the balls of your feet and not on the heel and.

Speaker 1:          01:04:25       But try to take in yoga. You know, I like Yoga. I like women with Yoga bodies that fucking long, like long lean, like thorax. It's a sexy look at a walmart or acts like they, they just have like a, like an insect body almost. It's long and Lincoln sex. What's that? Are you into bugs? No, but that's the best way I can compare them. I've had bugs on me. I don't care for them three times. Are you a book? Kutcher, uh, no, those guys are crazy, man. Fuck yeah, they actually almost want it. Yeah, they do want, they want it. I think it's pressure. Tell people what we're talking about. Bug catchers are guys I've only heard of being gay guy. Maybe the straight guys just do it, but they'll go out and fuck guys trying to catch HIV or let guys fuck them. Let guys fuck that.

Speaker 1:          01:05:08       Yeah. Yeah. I mean like guys fuck them to catch HIV. Like they really, they want it. Um, and I, I personally think it's because then the pressure is off. Um, that's my guess. I don't comprehend it. Think it's a self hate thing. Well maybe. Yeah. I think it's the same reason why some people want to amputate their hands. You know, some people are just nuts. That is kind of a nutty thing to do, to want to catch, you know, like why I don't even want it now. Even though I know that there's medicine that stops it. But we were talking about this yesterday was like, people that, why do people like fisting? It's just a show that your your past, what everybody else is thinking of his hardcore, like I'll take a whole fist right up to the elbow. Some women's pussies are weird though, man.

Speaker 1:          01:05:45       Like I gave the girl I dating a girl. You used to never get all of it and I would get. I have little hands too, but I'll get like the first four on my part of my knuckle and that would be our dirty talk. Like she would go crazy when I would talk to her and tell her that what I'm going to do is I'm gonna I'm gonna. I'm gonna curl the thumb. When I told I was in a curl, the thumbs she knew that the fist was going in. She'd go fucking nuts. Even though I was just talking dirty tour, I would say I'm going to curl the thumb and she knew that mental. He's putting his fucking fight but I couldn't. It bitch. Yeah. I could never get all of it is I got. I would get it in like this. Like a, like a praying mantis.

Speaker 1:          01:06:20       Like you're poking like a bird. Yeah. Well, your thumb is touching the floor, curled fates, cheating. It's a cheating way to fifth somebody. I don't get it. My asshole has zero ability to take more than a finger. Oh yeah, a whole fist. There's a video that Nick Swardson sent me and Whitney were talking about it yesterday. We're, there's a dude. He's holding a dude up, like in front of him, like, you know, like a sort of a backpack on the front, you know, the guys around him and he's got his fist all the way up to the elbow and this guy's ass and he just keeps pumping it up in there and he's holding the guy. Yeah, he's holding them up. Oh, he's got his arm wrapped around them and then the other arm is just going in their credit that both of those guys. It's amazing. Derek Pioneers for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       That reminds me of holding up. I was watching season two again of the ultimate fighter and there's one thing where they do like how long, how many rotations around the heavyweight can. I think they were either a middleweight or welterweight. Do were he climbs on top of the heavyweight. I've never seen that before. Uh, and he was going around like, how many different times can you go around this heavyweight body without touching the ground? I figured 10:50. I mean it was fucking a hundred or 200 times the way around, the ability to hold somebody else up. But see, the thing about something like that is doing a contest like that. You gotta realize that person's blown their body out for days after that, if that's not something you're accustomed to and you're doing on a daily basis, that's like doing a chin up contest like David Goggins, like if you do that, don't plan on fighting. You know, how is your arms are going to be blown out, your, your legs are going to be blown out. You're, you're going to get fucked up. It's definitely a good skill to have, but doing something like that, you could do it one time to find out what your Max is, but don't plan on recovering from that anytime soon. That's the thing about people in injuries, like one of the big problems with injuries with MMA fighters, Jujitsu people, a lot of people is overtraining,

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       meaning you're not prepared for what you're doing. Like I have a friend, my friend Cam hands runs a marathon a day. He runs a marathon every day. Well, he had a buildup to that. Does he really? Yeah. He's. He's training for this 238 Mile Moab a race in October, so if you're running 238 miles, his ideas, he gets a marathon in every day, so his body is just constantly used to this sort of stress, but for him it's not that big a deal. Like he'll run a marathon. It's not a problem, but if you tried to run a marathon every day your body would break down. You'd have some serious issues and the first day I couldn't do it. Yeah, but again, you might be able to do it. It might be able to take you eight hours. You might be able to get through it, but you're going to be fucked up for awhile, but if you built up to it slowly over time you could develop the kind of muscular endurance that allows you to do something like that. You get conditioned to it. So like doing something like that where you're doing like these rotations around someone or you're doing like how many times he climbed to the top of a 30 foot rope, you know, someone's doing something like that. If that's not something you do all the time and you just try to do it once, like on a television show for, for funsies. Sure. You could fuck yourself up.

Speaker 1:          01:09:31       Yeah, no, I'm just saying things along those lines. Like when you're trying to do as many as you can, anytime you're doing as many as you can. Like how many bodyweight squats can you do? Maybe 100, you know, like, okay, let's see if you can get to $500. Good luck walking for the last couple of days if that's. If you try to do that. I like a couple of. Is it now this guy does chin up. Does he do like the perfect military ones? Probably. If he's a navy seal, I'm sure you lil boys. Full Body, hand up. Yeah. Those kipping Chin ups are kind of where they flop around like a fish are going to use the ones where they go, they lift up and then they go hire. Like when they pull their full body weight above the muscle up, fuck that. You're just chin up and then you do a dip and then it's not.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       It's a lot of people think it's not the best functional exercise. They think it looks cool and everything like that, but they don't believe it's. It's a vest, functional exercise, but the guys that can do that, so like I've always. I've looked at guys do that with these guys that do these, these guys, these guys are freaks. These are outdoor guys where they work outdoors and they can just do an endless amount of things outdoors. They can hold the bar sideways. They're like, look at what this guy's doing. He's just doing like Chin ups and dips and sideways. Incredible. The upper body strength and control. Yeah. Not just the strength but like the static control, these able to do like, oh my God, he's fuck. It looks like he's being blown into a hurricane. Yeah, a lot of people do those really called flag poles. Can you do that? I've never done that. Why am I saying that? Surprising? Of course I can't do it. It's not easy, but I could do it. So what does, what does that mean? These guys don't have that kind of balance. Like that guy is a. he's doing like a, a dip to a handstand. I can't do that in between the two bars. Yeah. And these guys, they all wear, which I find interesting.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       I guess they do that because the, the bars get sweaty. Yeah. You also don't want to slip and probably flux your hands up. Yeah. I used to work little fingerless gloves when I worked out just to keep my hands. I'm like curly from mice and men like dice. Yeah, exactly. Keep my hand smooth and softwares those because he are the one shake hands and I was on. I was on the road though. He's the would do when someone would come over, he curls his. He has a fingerless gloves. They'll curl his fingers into the glove and give them a fist to shake the fucking worse.

Speaker 3:          01:11:42       He's so crazy. He hated shaking hands with people and he would go and watch this. I remember one time we were out to eat and some guy he washed his hands on. Guy came over and shook his hand and said, oh, I up. I had to go to the bathroom again. It's so funny that he's just, he's such a pig on stage, but he hates germs. He likes fucking honey and his tea. Like he's just a big Mama's boy. He likes to be comforted. He's an. He's a very interesting guy. Dies and he's also in a lot of ways a pioneer because he was one of the very first ever superstar stadium comedian. Yes, he was. There was no one like that. Like even kinison never hit that level before. Steve Martin, I think at one point had that. But yeah, but. And he had a tremendous mistake.

Speaker 3:          01:12:21       Tilt them to Steve Martin. Was was, was the biggest comic in the world for a long time, but dice had this thing where he, uh, he came out like a fist and just punch through everything. No one saw him coming. There was no snl. It was just this fucking animal. Like, I remember the first time I standardized play. I was a girl named Melanie who. No, no. Uh, uh, whatever the fuck. Her name is Michelle. My girlfriend, I was 18. I was at her house. So she's like, come in here. This guy is so dirty. And I stood there and watched Andrew dice clay the first time. You remember Richard Price by favorite? Carla. I don't remember the first time I saw them, but I remember the first time I saw, I remember the first time I played dice dice cassette to this girl that I was dating.

Speaker 3:          01:12:59       Her name was [inaudible]. She was from Nicaragua and uh, we were in my car. I think I was like, I think I was 19 and uh, we were sitting in my car playing this dice clay thing, fucking howling laughing. I couldn't believe how dirty it was. And how funny it was, it was, it was, it was dirty and it was funny. Do you, do you ever have Florentine on? No. Oh yeah. Have I had Jim on? I feel like I have. Jim Florentine is hilarious and when he used to do is he would make his girlfriend mixed tapes of all these romantic songs and he would put fucking bits from the day the laughter died and the day of the laughter died and just align or to play like a really nice song that I want to eat. You're cutting a big red chair. And then I saw. It's funny as a glass of milk my favorite. Heck align ever. Yeah. Oh. Because dice had been talking about drinking milk and slipping on it. Like it's come. People are slipping like somebody load and the guy is so mad the audience, he can't grasp what to say. She goes, you're a funny as a bottle of milk because he just used what dice had just said onstage. Well, we explained to people the day the laughter died was when dice was on top of the world. He decided to record at danger fields unannounced. So danger

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       fields in New York is a historically been like, uh, a poorly attended club. Sure. Like, we would do shows how poorly attended it is. I did a show there once where I think my spot was probably like at 9:00 and I got there at 8:30 and uh, there's just a couple of comics hanging out at the bar. I was like, what's going on? And they go, no one's here yet. And I go, what? No one's here. There's no audience. So two people showed up a couple. They said a, we're here to show. And Remember Scotty, the big guy, the big Irish guy, bobby, bobby rather. Oh yeah, bottom. He was Scott. I'm sorry I fucked it up. Bobby. He was like, right this way, ladies and gentlemen. And he brought these people into an empty room and they're like, what? And they sat them down and then the MC went up.

Speaker 2:          01:14:56       So they started to show a half hour late because that was the first time people showed up and we all did sets for two fucking people have done. It was really weird. So dice sides to record his album. They're unannounced with no material. He had no preparation. He just winged it the entire thing and it's both brilliant and terrible at the same time. It's a two CD thing because it was like he was up there for fucking hours, three nights, three nights, and he was up there with. That's dice at danger fields from the special that that's when he did Rodney dangerfield special. So we toured with him. No, that he was on Rodney Dangerfield, HBO special. That's how he broke. And then he came back and did the day. The laughter died. But I don't think there's any pictures. Clips out of Kenny was with him when he did those.

Speaker 2:          01:15:52       Those cds. I'm so jealous that he got to watch those tapings. Well Kenny was like his bodyguard or something, right. Wasn't manager body guard. When I first started the dice it was like 1997 and it was. Kenny was the road manager and a body guard. Is that Rodney and Fabio? Wow. Is that and dice? Who's that? Rodney. His wife would get mad, I guess. Is that Rodney's wife or no? Is that Fabio getting married? Someone's getting married. Fabio can get married with a shirt open like that radius. So that day the laughter died for Comedians. There was a guy named Mike Donovan who's a Boston comedy legend. Fucking hilarious, hilarious comedian, and he is the one who told me about the day the laughter died, didn't he? We were in the back of the comedy connection and he was just laughing until he was crying, talking about dice, do an impression of Nixon while he's eating. I'll do Nixon in that ass. Give me that book. Fat fucking. I mean, he was doing a Nixon impression while he's eating as and for whatever reason, Mike Donovan thought it was the funniest thing I've ever heard in his life. He's just cry and laugh and it's like, this is a brilliant, brilliant album. It is Rick Rubin producers out there. Yeah. For that album. It's a. it's an odd masterpiece. It's a. it's, it's, it's a beautiful that he did that because there is a flow to it, but it's like it's the greatest.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       Watching a comics mind just fucking randomly bounce from joke to joke to bomb to joke and just really exploring and grabbing for shit. Yeah. And there's no material preparation, you know, you can tell he's just totally ad libbing. Yeah. That's the album cover. I remember getting it and listening to and being so close. Look at that cassette one. Yeah. And people who didn't know I liked, there was also people who didn't like it, like this sucks. What is this? But uh, Chris rock is at the seller one night and I forget how it goes, the best comedy album ever. One of them he said did after that I'll have to die by Angela, but that's also the best comedy album for him because he's a comic and he thinks it's hilarious. This guy just went up there and just had no fucking no preparation whatsoever. I've laughed harder. But your prior albums, and I did it that there are better comedy record, but as far as being a pure thing to show like what comics do sometimes to work stuff out. He literally, like you said, Papa, this game, he was fucking 19, 99. Probably sold a million copies of that too. Yeah, to a fucking 800,000 unhappy people.

Speaker 3:          01:18:21       He didn't even call the day the laughter die. He didn't give a fuck. He would go up sometimes and literally like to see how long he could go without getting a laugh and clubs. He would just fuck around and see how long he could go and not get a laugh. My favorite is insult. Dice. When you find someone in the audience and go look, good, you look good to really cut your fucking hair digging on people and they wouldn't know whether to laugh or be upset and it would be like. It was almost angry at them for being alive. He described women's tits and he and he goes, look at those big fat fucking mother fucking fat fucking tits. And it was really dirty, but I'm like, my God, that's emotionally the best description of tits. Everyone's big ones. That's how you feel though. You can't get the words that will describe the lust of big breasts, more than fat.

Speaker 3:          01:19:14       Fucking motherfucking fat. Fucking it. There was something so guttural about that. I'm like, that's the greatest description of tits. And nobody's ever given. As far as emotionally for a guy. Well, you know what dice did to that nobody else has ever done before or since. Has He created punchlines that everybody wanted to repeat? Yes. Those wines are amazing. People wanting to repeat what's in the bowl bitch. Like he would point the microphone to the audience and they knew the punchline and they would yell it out and cheer. Yeah, on day left die. They tried doing a poem. He goes, no stupid. Like doing poems. Know poems. Yeah. He had no qualms. Not even, hey, I'm not doing that. Like Robin Williams did in the album called a reality. What a concept, which was the first dirty album I ever had was Robin Williams reality. What a cop before even prior and he and somebody yelled out, mark and Robin goes, I'm not doing more. Come here to do something different. Like he, he did it nicely and people clapped, but he didn't go.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       No, like with dice, they needed them that night and they're just trying to connect with other poem and he could've got them. Fuck you. They get it. They almost were being punked like they were there for a comedy show and the most famous comic alive at the time. Yes. Came up and just ate dick for three hours a day for three fucking hours over three night period. It's a nine hour fucking ball munching, but he also, it was funny male, he dies. Changed the language. Like people like what did political correct to start. If you look back to when it really kicked in, it was. They were so disgusted and angry at dice. That was what kicked political. Correct. Plus, you know, the Internet was really kicking in. There's a lot of factors, but dice is the one who was, he was the straw that broke the broke people like I can't fucking take anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:20:59       We have to stop talking this way. Well, he went on MTV, remember the, he did a bunch of jokes that they didn't approve and they banned him from MTV for life. And meanwhile, today that's a God damn. I mean, badge of honor. Yeah, he went, nobody wants to be on MTV now, but back then it was like, Holy Shit. They banned him from Auntie VI. Kennison criticized him for that. He built, he went out and Kurt loder was on TV talking about how unfunny terrible unfunny period jokes, you know, it's like, but it was this, this air of like pompousness like, and he was talking about this is progressive, you know, Kurt loder type character who was always like the guy who told you about the amazing, cool new bands was telling you the dice, just terrible and unfunny and you'll never be on MTV. Uh, Ken and I remember thinking that like, whoa.

Speaker 1:          01:21:49       They banned him from siren it live. They banned him from MTV. He didn't give a fuck or Kenny again. I, Kenny told me that the Guy Andrew may have told me this too, but before he went out, he was thinking of doing it. It might've been, I'm not. Who's The guy? Johnny? Uh, Johnny he had with them, um, whose name I don't remember fucking. Oh my God. You know, it's the journey that he traveled with for years. Is it possible to not noodles? Um, no, no, something johnny. But he said, uh, he said to dice, do you want to be a teardrop or a tidal wave? Which I thought was such a great fucking piece of advice to give someone before he went out on live television with that dilemma. Well now I mean, now that it's all the dust has been settled. Who? Johnny what?

Speaker 1:          01:22:39       What's the, what was his name? No hot tubs. John and Jesus. I never met him. I'd never met him. He was he a comic? I don't know. He was dices guy. He write wrote with dice. He toured with them. I think he was the road manager at one point, but I never met hot tub. It was. Kenny was there when I came in in 1997, but that was the name fucking forgetting shit man. You went well. It's just like a slick rick should happen. Yeah, it does. Well, you have too many experiences, you know, like you talked to someone who lives in a small town about a small town

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       and the stuff that he does in that town that motherfucking can remember everything, but talk to a guy who travels the world and to stand up and takes pills to stop getting aids. Boy, what a sigh of relief. I was fucking, I'll tell you, one of the most nervous I've ever been was when I took the, uh, just to digress for a second, was to take the uh, I was so convinced that HIV and I fucking took this oral test that you can get from cvs. And there's a weird thing where you just said it's up a good up until the last three months. It's like in the high, 90 percent accurate. Not One hundred percent, but it's a good precursor to the bucket blood. So I did it. And you have to, you, you, you, you rub it on your gums once each and then you put it in this, this, uh, this folding, like almost like a trapper keeper.

Speaker 3:          01:23:47       And you close it and they say what happens is there's a red line and if there's two red lines, you're positive, the one red line stays there. And they said, do not watch the progress because it will freak you out. Don't watch it. Of course you watch it only for a second because I literally thought I saw the beginning of a second line and I remember closing it and I'm like, I have HIV. I was fucking convinced. I went, I remember where I went. It went down to the fucking store, bought a couple of rx bars. I'm like, I'm just going to have a nice fucking protein bar and go back and 20 minutes, whatever it was. And I couldn't black I to photograph it. I couldn't believe that I was negative. But I came back and it was clear I was, I was a hundred percent convinced that HIV was scary.

Speaker 3:          01:24:29       Man. I'm well anytime there's something like that where you don't know if you have it and if you do have it, it's a death sentence or even it wasn't even that thought was die because now there's so many. This is recent, this is probably three months ago. There's so many medications you can take, but it's the idea of having to tell a partner and like, who's going to want to fuck you with that? Like that's just a rough one. You know what I mean? I'm dating someone. I'm going to tell her I kind of Charlie Sheen, get it. I don't know. And if you noticed that was the question that Matt Lauer, I don't believe asked. Um, I don't think they got into it. So I don't know. Yeah. So Matt Lauer and him talk because he was getting blackmailed. Yes, he was. There's a shit ton of lawsuits because he had an unprotected sex without telling a bunch of people that he had it.

Speaker 3:          01:25:13       That's crazy. I mean, that's, that's crazy. Even if you're down to zero, then you still got to tell them, tell them to zero where it's not visible because they can knock it down to where it's undetectable and I really do think you can't pass it then because there are drugs that you won't be able to pass it and prep. We won't able to get it, but I still think you're obligated to say it. You know, you're obligated to say it and then you let that person make the decision. Right. You know what I mean? You, you, you can't make that decision for them. Yeah, no, for sure. But I mean this is all cocaine party mean everyone's just having terrible judgment. Yeah. I imagine that was quite a bit of naughty behavior in the residence times doing tremendous amounts of blow. Yeah. Like they would talk about him doing below that would kill a normal size person. I heard somebody to what I've heard about the black male and I don't know, I really wish I knew who had blacked out. I don't. Was that got a picture of

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       medication in his medicine cabinet is a video of him sucking a guy's Dick. Um, I've heard that too. I've heard that, but I don't know. That's true. I mean, you think he probably didn't know that video's being to y'all that was taken without him knowing. Well, who knows? Maybe when you're coked up like film it. Let's do it. Yeah. You know, I mean when you have a kid that's rough. I mean otherwise, like who cares if he sucked a dick who gives a fuck? And you're great and platoon when you give a shit. But you know what I mean? It gives a fuck. Major League who's really, you know, believe me, I'm very unsung. Film it. Wall Street. It was good in it. Ha. Very good. Most him and Martin Sheen together. Fuck crazy. I think that a certain point in time when you're doing that kind of drugs, like you're doing crazy disassociative piles of blow and you're fucking, you don't know where the fuck you are.

Speaker 1:          01:26:53       You're freaking out. You're constantly paranoid. They said its teeth were rotting out of his head. It looked like a few pictures of his teeth did not look like they are in amazing shape. A sheen also doesn't know how he contracted the virus, but told lauer it had nothing to do with needles. Oh, well then he does have a good idea. Well, how could he say? Well, it means you mean sexually. He had nothing. He never did anything with needles. Rumors about the actress health recently emerged in the tabloid press. So where, where, where's he at now? Like he's like Khan. He's kind of fucking radio dark, nothing. He just did a film. He did a film that nine slash 11, but people trapped in an elevator. He's um, and they said, well, you know, he had some conspiracy theories they shouldn't have cast. So it gives a fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:27:30       It's a movie. None of these people are dead. They're alive. They just did a movie. Well, do you remember he wrote an open letter to President Obama. He's a big fan of Alex Jones and friend of Alex Jones. And He, Alex Jones called me up. Hey Man, Gary Busey wants to talk to you. And then he fucking. Gary Busey. And Gary Busey talked to me and he's like, uh, I mean Carrie pcs completely out of his fucking lie. But Gary Busey as an excuse. Gary Busey got in a motorcycle accident with no helmet and caved his head in like real bad. That's why Gary Busey, when you're looking at one eyes up here, he's got that Shannon Shannon Doherty thing going on. Oh, it's down here when I was up there. It's because it's literal skull was destroyed in a motorcycle accident. He hit a fucking curb with his hedge, right?

Speaker 1:          01:28:18       Yeah. And seeing that picture, if his eyebrows are up, it makes it look like he's okay. But I'm getting to the one on our right. His left is the one that drew. That's what it looks like is left as Jack. But he, we've had him in a couple of times when he came back in, he remembered my. I thought like, he's loopy, but he's not like, out of it. Like, yeah, he knew. I mean he wasn't. He's a little nutty, but he's always been a little nutty. But he didn't know. He remembers lying. He can, he can act. Yeah. See how his right eyebrows up? Yeah. Right. Eyes up and left. One's down. Yeah. He had a significant brain injury. Yeah. Yeah. There it is. Oh yeah. Before that, before that accident, he was a pretty normal guy. He has that injury. That's fucking TB.

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       They already called Tbi. Traumatic brain. That fucking wide open. Look at you again. Will you see guys are both eyes like that? They're fucking cooked. Well, there's a little bit of that, but I believe there's structural damage to his actual skull itself. I think I'm. I'm. I'm almost positive that he hit the curb without a helmet is when la didn't have helmet laws and he wiped out and curbed is fucking brain and was lucky to be alive, if I remember correctly. Yeah. I don't remember when that was, but. Oh fuck motorcycles, man. They scare me. They, I watched all this website I go to. I watch a lot of terrible things that I shouldn't watch, but I fucking seen these motorcycle accidents. I'll always watch and car accidents because that really does remind me to drive safe. Like you can't control everything, but when I say guy burning to death in a car or fucking cut in half, I'm like, maybe it's not his fault.

Speaker 1:          01:29:48       Oh yeah. He went under a tractor trailer. He was texting and driving and that's what it looks like. Don't fucking do it. So I'm really, really cautious when I drive I by Les. We drove in your Porsche. Last one we did if I can pay and I was like, wow, you're a responsible porsche driver. Like you don't drive like an animal at all. No. All you have pretty much around the limit. Maybe a little over. But you weren't a fucking maniac? No, I don't drive fast. I would never drive fast with a friend of the car either. I don't. I'm not a dickhead driver. Occasionally I've dickhead moments for when no one's around, but I don't. I don't put anybody else in danger. I don't. I don't believe in driving like that. No. It was a delightful Dr. it was not frightening at all. It was comfortable with it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:25       You get nervous when you got into the car. I didn't know I've driven with you before, but if I didn't know you I might, but just having a porsche, it's just known as somebody who's going to move that car in particular because it's so loud and so bouncy and you know, but I think you do a lot more to lose than I do. So I'm like, I figured you'd be driving safe. Like I'm like, it's not like you don't want to drive with the guy who has nothing. Like how you doing? Oh I just lost my fucking house. I ain't got no gig and these two red lines getting the cat. I just put a new engine and so yeah, you want to go with a guy who's got a little bit more to lose than you do. But it was safe. Comfortable. Right. Like those cars because they're light and the responsive and so it's like riding a ride, like a Disneyland ride everywhere you go.

Speaker 1:          01:31:05       It doesn't, I don't like, I don't want people. How fast have you ever gotten it to? I've never gotten it that fast. I don't drive that fast. I don't, I'm not. I like cornering, like I'm into cars that grip and feel good. When you're, you're, you're, you're connected to the machine. BMW. Drive like that. Dumping. Sure. Yeah. I had one. This wheel is a kind of stiff and they said that that's for. It's because high performance encrypts the road. Well, they have a bunch of different settings you could put on a bmw, especially the m cars. They can make the, you can vary the stiffnesses of the uh, steering because they're a electronic power assist. But uh, the, the, if you want a car that lists are really responsive. That's a BMW. They have an m two. It's a tiny little car. It's like one of their least, least expensive m cars, but most enthusiastic it's their best one.

Speaker 1:          01:31:52       I don't, I don't, I've driven. I had, you know, had the XX. I drove like three in a row. I was leasing them. They were really big cars and I was like, I want, I kind of wanted a Mercedes or a lot cheaper. I've never driven over selling fucking Mercedes with cheaper. This was a much cheaper, much cheaper. The BMW is just too big. I live in the city, I have a car because I like to drive. It's like for what? My addiction. If I said I kept that because years ago I would ride around and look at fucking hookers. That was. Yes, that was why I did, but I might've been. I might've been doing that now. Like I'm totally out of that. The actual cruising, the pay pay and people. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I pay pal for dirty videos sometimes in movies of girls who are doing things just because you know what I mean, but just paying for sex.

Speaker 1:          01:32:36       The sex trafficking shit just freaked me out too much. Oh, that's awful. It freaked me out too much and I know I'm all for consensual, like women, like I, I talked to a woman once who was a. she's, I guess you could say she was an escort. She had, she had done porn and she stopped doing porn and she said the way she said it, she likes, she said she had clients and I was like, well how does that work? And she's like, well off the record there's a bunch of guys that I've had sex with in the past and I liked them and they pay me and I'll go over there and it's almost like people I really like and I have sex with them and I said like, how many times a week? She goes, I only need to do it a few times a week and I pay my bills, you know, girls like that.

Speaker 1:          01:33:17       After I stopped going on certain sites, girls like that who I knew it was important me, like I knew their lives, who they were under their real names. I knew their facebook, like you know what a person's life is and they're just choosing to do this on the side because a, you have a chemistry with them and they like you and be they. Some of them are just dirty. I've met plenty of just dirty and enjoy it. Well, I didn't know her too well and I didn't ask too many questions, but from what she was saying, it was essentially like, you know, she had done porn, she didn't want to do porn anymore and she didn't want to be just a quote unquote hooker, but she had a few guys that wanted to have sex and would be willing to pay her and I guess they apparently a couple thousand bucks and she would just have sex with these guys a couple times a week, different guys and she'd make four or $5,000 a week and she wouldn't have to worry about shit and she could do whatever she wanted to do for as long as my body holds up.

Speaker 1:          01:34:05       I mean when I talked to this quite a long time ago, I think she was probably like 36 or 37 at the time, so it's like maybe she can't do that anymore. Maybe now she's 46, 47 or 50 and maybe dudes will. How much they try to find an older sugar daddy, I think, or a guy that they've stayed. That's where they start. That's probably when they want to wife up to like when you're. Yeah. That's a hard thing for men. Like a lot of men do not want to shack up with a chick that had sex for money. You know, I don't mind it. Like I don't want them doing it when I'm with them, but I like somebody with the past. I really need it because my past is so fucked up. I much prefer yours as to what the fuck is this Jamie? The Korean grandmothers or sell sex? How do you pull these up so quick? What do you have on tab? Like what is wrong with you? I saw this story the other day. I don't remember as a video about the box. It's called Baucus ladies, I believe it's a drink called Baka. So they walk around selling the baucus as an energy

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       drink to a step. Like there were like 40 and 50 year old women, but now they're elderly women are doing it too and so you buy the drink but you're buying sex is what you're reading. What it says. I don't understand the way around the loophole. A loophole, prostituted, you buy this drink and I'll give you sex or like street vendors with energy drinks, but when you buy it from them, you're really saying, hey, come with me somewhere. I guess where is this happening on Korea? South Korea. Pretty smart work around. So the guys by the energy drink knowing that they're gonna get some sex. That's what the video described. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:35:31       technically is a, but I just, I've known too many people I've known who were like pseudo forced into it by a boyfriend and one girl I was talking to recently was the industry like yeah, my boyfriend had made me kind of do it and she got wanted to at one point, but then he hit me when I didn't want. I'm asleep man. There's too many people. I don't know their story. If I can guarantee there's just consensual, I'm fine with it being legal, I don't care. But it freaked me out that there was too many people that I didn't know enough about. Like I never go to places. I never went to those places because they felt too much like the Russian mob or the Asian, whatever it was controlling them, but then even people I thought I knew, I'm like, I can't guarantee it and I can't.

Speaker 3:          01:36:08       Well that's very ethical of you. Like you were thinking about them being forced into that life over time. It just got to me because more like I would talk to different people and at first it was like, Eh, the feminist. Of course they're going to say that, but then there was certain people that said certain things that someone just says something. See there's some feminists that think it's empowering for a woman to be able to choose what to do with her body. I know, I know a woman who's a very smart woman and when she was younger she had done and she's an artist. She had done some sex work but it was just like she fucked some guys for money and like for her it was like easier than working. Yeah. And I'm not saying I think it should be legalized. I think that people should be able to do that.

Speaker 3:          01:36:46       I just personally, as I was getting older and I'm like, this is not what I want to do anymore. I think boring. Well it's also, you know, it just anytime someone's being forced to do something and then there's potential shame attached to it. Like I don't think there's anything wrong with sex and I don't know. You don't either, but when you attach the potential societal shame aspect of it, like your behavior, your choices could shame you can be a real problem. You know, like the same thing with sex, right? Like people having sex. Who Care? Everybody have sex. We'd love sex people. Most people love sex, right? But the idea of you being caught on film having sex is terrifying for a lot of people, which is really weird. It's really weird. Like we know you love sex, but if we see you having sex, well, shame. Yeah, it's a really. You're right, because it's almost like this why I hate when people break into these hard drives in the cloud for these celebrities because it's a weird privacy thing. Like even if you're not doing something you're not supposed to have. You talked to your wife, you talked to your girlfriend, who wants people hearing that it's embarrassing and it's private. I'm, look, I'm very open about most things sexually in my life, but I still don't want people to read specific things I've said because it just feels like invasion of privacy

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       page and it's also like you didn't write it for other people to hear and there's. There's things you say to your friends, right, that if they took out of context, people would go, well Jim Norton's a fucking asshole. He's a piece of shit. Like, like even in just like this thing that I did with Ari sent him a text message that I put it on instagram is Avi. I thought it pretty obvious that it was in jest, but so many people thought it was really like the context of your friendship and people who don't understand they don't know you. And then there's also the comedian factor. Like the way we talk to each other on a regular basis is so different than the way a lot of folks can because if you're working in an office job nine to five every day you're controlled by human resources and the the, the, the office standards of behavior. You have to follow some sort of a firing guidelines of what's term to what you can get terminated for those people are on the edge and tiptoeing on fucking broken glass every day.

Speaker 3:          01:38:55       It's scary and you know is Sirius Xm is a corporate environment and I'm fucking. I'm a fucking dirty comic and I'm more careful around the women there than half of the fucking newscasters. You hear about getting. It's like if I know that as a fucking dirt bag, you don't fucking hit on the women at work. Ask them gently, did we talk about now okay and fuck off.

Speaker 2:          01:39:16       Well not even worse, but these guys weren't just doing that. They were sexually harassed. Absolutely. It's crazy. It's not that they were hitting on him. I mean, office environments are just Whitney. Cummings is a very funny joke about that. I don't want to say it because it's, it's one of her new bits about working in an office, but there's so much sexual tension when you're stuck in a room with people for eight hours a day and if two people are attracted to each other and they're working side by side on a daily basis, occasionally they test the waters and say fucked up things and then saying those fucked up things. Women are allowed to do whatever they want essentially. Like it's really hard. It's really hard for her to get fired. Yeah. I mean a woman says something dirty you. It's kind of funny, but if a guy says something unwanted and dirty, it's really disgusting because why? Well, because men rape in, they're more dangerous and they're scarier. You know, they're physically more scary. So a guy intruding on a woman's space and saying creepy, unwanted sexual shit has an air of danger to it. Whereas if a girl is saying some creepy, unwanted sexual shit to me, I can go, hey, stop. You know, like you can't say don't talk to them. Like precursor to her making you do it. Yeah. It's never, she's going to grab my head, forced me to eat her pussy. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:40:23       Great thought though, isn't being made to do it. That's one of my greatest being made to be made. Stick your tongue up further. Sniff it. Fart in your mouth. Yeah, we've all been there. You ever have someone do that? I'd have it. It was all right. Not Bad. Not that. No. I had a girl and I didn't go. And did I tell you this? She's trying to push a fart out and she shot monistat seven on my chest. Oh, it was fucking monistat seven is something girls putting their vagina infection. Oh, Jesus is not my best moment. Would it smell like? I don't believe it had a smell. I don't remember having a smell. You had to explain that it was Monistat so exactly what it was. We both knew what it was. You know? It was a bad. It was a bad scene, but she was really fucking sexy.

Speaker 3:          01:41:15       Big Fat ass. Yeah. Just trying to Fart on you. Yeah, just take. I mean, I don't really care about that, but I was like, yeah, why not? Quite my face. That's whose idea was it? Mine, but I think she said I have to. I'm like, go ahead. What are you already said you have to you? She said, no, no, I think she said I have to Fart. Oh, she said I have to Fart. Fart in my mouth. Yeah. We had always done that. Besides did licked her ass and she's great at. You know what I mean? We were kind of far from that. Nah, not that I know of. Somebody must have terrible way to feel like, why didn't I just shower up first? I don't like to shower them up first. I don't like the. I like this. I like a scent. I literally like.

Speaker 3:          01:41:53       You liked that you liked sheep? I liked them. I was telling you like, I'll tell her like if I'm dating you and I like you, I literally have thrown girlfriends, deodorants out. Really? I fucking do. You want them to stink a little? Yes, but I have to fucking way you're saying it, but I have to like them. Oh, it has to be. It's a chemistry thing. That's nature telling you who you should fucking who you shouldn't fuck, because some people sent repulses me the smell of their mouth or the smell of their skin repulses me, unhealthy people probably. Or even people that I'm just not meant to breed with. But then there's some people, the underarm smell the smell of their feet when they're stinky. Dude, it makes me not dirty. I don't like dirty feet. Like I don't want you to talk a little stinky in socks and sneakers because clean.

Speaker 3:          01:42:38       There's a whole fucking thing of it here. So orderly, but clean. It is intense. Your eyes, you're like, no, no, no, no socks and sneakers because it's clean because you do feel like a creep when you're talking to a girl and you say to her like, I want your feet to be a certain way I would say, but you want to let her know, don't make them dirty. Like don't come over and flip flops or I don't want you walking around on a, on a, on a floor without. You know what I mean? Like I like, I'm a hygiene person. Sweaty. Yeah. But um, I've been with that with girls. I tell them like, don't shower for three days. Oh, Jesus makes me crazy. And what do they say? Great. Really the good ones, this is great. Honestly, they fucking love it. Um, but again, if I don't like you, if I'm not attracted to your San, I have no desire for that.

Speaker 3:          01:43:20       So that's how I know I meant to be with somebody. You know, Chris Ryan, Dr Chris Ryan, who was a friend of mine was telling me that women, when they're on birth control pills, their ability to smell whether or not a mate is sexually compatible with them gets hindered by the birth control pill. It fucks it up. But when they have women that are not on birth control pills, they can literally smell a man's clothes and find out whether or not they're sexually compatible with them. Just whether or not they're attracted to them. Like there's a literally a specific scent and that sent

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       they think is not just like whether or not you're sexually attracted to someone smell, but whether or not you're biologically compatible with them. Like do you remember back in the day when people would get married, they would do blood tests to see if they could have kids remember that? I don't. There was a thing that they used to talk about, like people would have tests to see it. I don't know if, you know, it was legitimately scientifically valid, but they would have tests like a blood test and I remember people talking about this when I was in high school like that married people would have go and have these blood tests to see if they could not, not pregnancy. Oh No, no, no, not pregnancy, but whether or not they were compatible. Like as far as like raising healthy kids. There was some weird. I mean it might've been some bullshit fake science that they tried to pass off back in the seventies and the eighties, but I distinctly remember people talking.

Speaker 2:          01:44:45       This is like before I was anywhere near blood typing compatibility. Yeah. Blood types of categorized by a, B and o. we're reading something here and given the rh factor of positive or negative, Abo and rh in compatibility happens when a mother's blood type conflicts with that of a newborn child. It's possible for the mothers red blood cells to cross into the placenta or fetus during pregnancy. Yeah, but that's. I'm incompatibilities between a mother and a child. I think it's between a man and a woman and the way they have theirs is probably bullshit, but it was something that people used to do a lot. I remember people talking about it. I remember people talking about it when I had a very, very limited understanding of biology, so I was probably in high school and even before that, but I was like, what blood tests? They have to take a blood test. I'm like, what if you love somebody and you want to get married to them? You find out that you take a blood test and it doesn't work out. Like how does that work?

Speaker 3:          01:45:39       Maybe the worker, maybe that's such a nature thing. Like maybe if it's not meant to be, it can still work. Like, you know what I mean? Nature may work on this fucking base level. Well yeah, it's still going to work, but that's like letting you know, it will work. Like, do you know what I mean? It may still work fine if you're sent is off, but they're closed. Thing makes sense. There was a girl I had come over. She would come over and mood fuck around and she wouldn't. Her underarms with smell and it made me fucking bonkers, man. I was so attracted to her since she left a jacket in my house, the fucking armpit. I smelled the armpits for six months.

Speaker 3:          01:46:11       You're so fucked up. It's dude. I fucking sniffed the armpit and I'm not a guy who's into toys or clothing. Like as far as a woman, I don't usually want their panties. I'm the girl I'm seeing now. I do though. I do want to. We're trying to figure out a way for her to fedex overnight and your panties. I've never asked to go do that my life ever tell her to put them in a Ziploc. Of course, of course, of course. That was number. Want me to tell him to tape the zip lock so it doesn't open up? Yes, but I mean that's really ultra rare that I actually want that. But this girl's jacket hung in my closet and I fucking smelled. That drove me crazy for months. I'm having Deja Vu. Losing today's

Speaker 2:          01:46:46       parents says that you should be getting blood tests for screening because

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       they can find out if they're going to have potential blood diseases and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. But that's. Today's parent is at a website. Yeah. Who's that knows? Is that a common practice? That's what I mean. It says, uh, this was like an article that says test you need to be getting before pregnancy and there's like a pre pregnancy checkup for the man and the woman, right. Prenatal vaccinations and then sexually transmitted diseases, you need to check for it to end genetic screening. It says so they just do like probably overall blood tests. It's very interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:47:16       [inaudible] you don't hear about that anymore. It's not like, you know, I, you don't hear about that from doctors. You don't hear about that when people were trying to get pregnant. You don't hear about that from newlyweds. Just don't hear about it. The blood tests. Yeah, like getting blood tests to make sure that your kids would be healthy or I wonder now though if there's so much stress put on disease shit like aids the day we still say get a blood test and get tested and all this stuff is handled, but maybe we just don't talk about the other aspect of it because the big one is HIV or whatever or hey, like, you know, get you had to check to see what diseases you're family has. Like maybe we're still talking about it, but it's just not being phrased the same way. This is why I don't think it's true because we went to a very good doctor and you know, I have, I have kids.

Speaker 2:          01:47:57       I never took a fucking test. The shot loads in there and made kids. He just alluded to it. I mean I just don't. I don't know. I mean maybe I dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno about the science of all that stuff and I just don't know why it was never discussed, but I do remember being a kid where that was a big deal like that a parent, these two parents would get a blood test before they got married and make sure they could have kids and it just never hear about that shit anymore. Yeah. I don't even remember hearing about it back then to be honest, but it does make sense. Like, Hey, let's just see if there's going to be like if there's an obvious problem that will show up through the blood test. Well how fucking weird is it that you could have a different kind of blood in me?

Speaker 2:          01:48:33       Like your blood might be a in mind. Might be, oh, like your blood is in my body. I'm fucked. Yeah. I got to keep my body. It's not even compatible. So that's what's so strange. It's like we vary so much biologically that we have different kinds of blood and one is not good in the other. Yeah, I mean there's some bloods that are universal. I believe it's o positive is a universal blood donor and anyone can take it. Yeah, that's what I have. I believe that my blood can go into other people's body and it's okay to find out if that's true. I don't know what I am. I probably should know. Yeah, he's probably 50. Jesus. I know. I'm busy. I'm fucking. I didn't ever check that busy. Just getting panty sent to me. I know, I know. I'm not really big on the undergarments though. I mean, um, you know, a couple girls have had them. I thought there were sexy. What is it about women wearing those stockings with the straps that go up to the underwear so hot because you're seeing something you're not supposed to be. Real Universal. Red Cell donor has type O negative o o negative. I think I'm o positive. Universal plasma donor has ab blood type R, H in general. Rh negative blood is giving to rh negative patients and rh blood or

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       rh negative blood may be giving to rh positive patients. Universal red cell donor has type O, o o negative blood type. Mm. Um, I need to figure out what I'm talking about. Yeah. I don't know much about the blood stuff at all. I mean for me it's just a, you know, what drives me sexually, like I know what I, you know, like let's, it is weird how some people can be like really pretty, but you don't find them attractive at all. And then other people not nearly as pretty, but you think they're so sexy. I've dated people who will this trigger words that we all like, so a good trigger word, poof, that goes a long way. Like it's not the dirty porn words, you know what I mean? You like that shit shut up now for me it's not, it's not a series of words or that kind of shit.

Speaker 1:          01:50:31       I'm not get not as dirty as you, but uh, for me it's just a personality thing that someone is comfortable, like someone is comfortable in their own skin and fun to be around and, and, and I'm passionate, you know, but also like affectionate, like affectionate to me is very sexy. So you have different things. We all have those things. I actually, yours is better because to me that's a more normal thing to be and then just a healthier thing without needing bells and whistles and fucking juggling and, and you know, and to see a woman with perfect features and she's cold and she's not friendly and nice. I don't find her attractive at all. Yeah. It does nothing for you to a woman who's like way less, like classically attractive, but she's very affectionate and very kind and sweet and fun to be around. I find that very attractive.

Speaker 1:          01:51:15       That will vary from person to person. I can go with kind and sweet or I can go with this certain words I like when they say like, some people just get it and they know how to talk and they know, they know your fucking triggers and it's just, it's an ownership for you. For me. Yeah. Yeah. You got weird kinks. Yeah man. It's all the night is crazy with this. Again, the personality, not crazy. I just like her or I love her. Whatever the fuck. What is it though? What do you do? Have you ever tried to examine like what are kinks? Like where is it coming from? Like what, what is it about like trigger words and weird things and weird stuff that like gets you turned on like w and w, is it how you're interfacing with the world? Is it how you're choosing to address all of your issues and that you can escape them with like really like crazy behavior and that like maybe you have all these anxieties and neurosis and that through this really bizarre dirty talk and freaky behavior.

Speaker 1:          01:52:08       You can escape those because it's so naughty. It's so off the [inaudible] you're not a normal guy. Right? But none of us are. If we're working in show business. If you're a standup comedian, right? You're getting paid to talk crazy shit on stage or you're not normal. You're, your world is in normal. You wake up whenever the fuck you want, unless you have to do a radio show. Right? So it's a different. The whole world you live in is different and then you have all this kinky shit and then you get added addictions to dirty stuff and so like whatever it is about like a girl saying something like that, she's going to go with me on this crazy dirty. A fart in my mouth. Yeah. Yeah. It's like you're, you're like escaping the troubles. Just for

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       a brief moment with all this insane behavior.

Speaker 3:          01:52:49       It could be that and I don't know. Sometimes I wonder like with. It's almost like if you eat too much ice cream is diabetes that will come with that. That could be the diabetes, like just too much access and all of a sudden instead of three to make this effect, it takes 11. It's just it. You can't get the same effect from the same thing. Like when I was growing up, I loved lesbian porn. I fucking love to girls. Oh my God. It drove me nuts. Now place. Are they related? No, I'm not interested. Does nothing that

Speaker 2:          01:53:15       killed it for me. When I was on news radio, one of the guys who was a writer on news radio is a very nice guy, but he was a nebbishy sort of fellow that had problems with women and he was a writer on news radio and in his moonlight time you used a pseudonym and wrote for porn. Oh. And so he took me to a porn set is my first porn set ever. And it was Jill Kelly and Janine. I'm sure you know who those Kelly. I know the name. Janine and Janine is the one that used to be married to the Jesse James Character, the biker guy. Oh yes. Beautiful woman. And her thing was that she only did a lesbian porn. That was her thing. Right. So I'm on the set and it was just so, like clinical, very, like it was weird like they were. They were doing the scene. Yeah, that's her. Yeah. She was on a blinker on a Tuesday album cover. It's a beautiful, beautiful woman. Right. So she's, um, she's got this scene as lesbian. I think she was like a cartoon character that came back to life or some ridiculous shit. Right? Is that what she looks like now? Oh Jesus. Is that a um. Yeah, but is that like a spa? That's a mug shot. She went to jail. I forget what she went to jail for it. But yeah, not good.

Speaker 2:          01:54:37       Anyway, things go south, right? That's what we were talking about earlier. Some of these gals that get a little older and all the pressure of the forbidden behavior, just the societal pressure and all the things that lead them to be that way in the first place come crashing down on them. But for, for this scene like there, the two of them were on a bed and they were eating each other's pussies and there was like this, uh, you know, there was a sound guy with the fuzzy mic that's on a stick that has hovered over him. And then there was a, another guy that was over there doing something. He was literally eating a sandwich where these girls are eating pussy. It's like he was so disinterested and then there was a director and then they were kind of aware that we were there watching, so she was sort of putting on this sort of self conscious show, like an in between takes. They would like, they go, okay, cut. And she was like, keep eating her pussy and she would say something like, I love my job, I love my job, but it was like convincing herself that she loved her job and it's just like super bummed me out.

Speaker 3:          01:55:36       Yeah. I've been on a bunch of those sets and you're right. But there's different energy depending on the set like I've been on when I hosted the award show the end with Jenna Jamison, so I got to one, one of her sets and watch. He actually was doing a lesbian scene. Her husband at the time, Jay, I guess was directing it and that was like a fucking set. There was a wardrobe, there was craft, you know what I mean? Like that was a set. It was a high end sheet at the craft service. We, he, yeah know I thought I just hot dogs and Tacos, I think I just watched her eat pussy. I'm like, this is Jenna Jamison. She is the biggest ever in this business. You have to watch this happen. And then we went on another one. I saw another one another day where it was like a lower budget average budget where it was two guys and a girl and the girl was in between the two guys and, but the director was gone, come on, let me a little bit more, a little bit more of that.

Speaker 3:          01:56:25       And they're, they're, they're amazing people that they can function sexually under those conditions. Totally unsexy. The sexiest one I saw was like a very low budget, like a guy, like one guy with a light and one guy holding a camera and a couple and they were like a couple who real amateur. And so it felt more like sex. Um, and I don't think the guy could get hard for a little while. He struggled a bit, but they were real people. That was the hottest one because it felt the closest to real sex. Does that make sense? That's like, yeah, that's actual sex. I don't like people like those sounds have too much. Ah Ha. The faking it. Stop it. I dated a couple girls in porn, like minor and one girl would blow me and I could never come from her. She could head, but it was like, that's not good.

Speaker 3:          01:57:12       Hey, settle down. Easy. Just a little fucking pick it up and down the mountain. They gag on purpose. Like, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. That's nothing for me. A little gag. Who likes that? There are guys that liked that guy named brandon irons. I, he's a Canadian guy with a giant Dick and he would always. He's a fucking night. Who's was a big porn actor for a while. I remember the fucking Joyce Rivera. You Know Joey? Yeah, I know what that guy is. Joe. He's a good friend of mine. And in, uh, I met him at the award show in 2000 January of 2004, but he's an older gentleman now, right? Oh, he's been late fifties, early sixties. Maybe that was he still do porn. Oh, he's, no, he shoots it. He shoots a lot of transport, like yeah, joey is a fucking, he's a naughty boy.

Speaker 3:          01:57:52       He's a great director because he loves it. He loves directing because he likes what he's doing. So my, the first time I did the tonight show was in like September of 2004 I think. And I watched it at Joey's house downstairs and I've seen so much porn shot in that house. And, and brandon irons was upstairs with his girlfriend. Anyway. Brandon irons, his throat fucker. Like he's the guy look up brands and Ireland someday that guy will teach a Canadian dude, I think he's in Canada now. He will fucking rip a throat apart and it's not my thing, but I think I asked him like, don't you ever get your Dick Bitten? Like it just seemed like such a hard way to have sex and I don't like, you're going to be uncomfortable. Like you know what I mean, like spanking or whatever. But I don't like to feel like I'm missing somebody.

Speaker 3:          01:58:34       That's just not my energy. Also problem is like if you get hard, if that's exciting on film, like is that exciting to you in regular life or is this just like an act that you're putting on and film and like how do you like how sexually, how does it translate or can you do both? Right. He might be a guy who just can get his dick hard anywhere. Like Nacho vidal could literally fuck during a house fire. It's just one of those guys that nothing matters to him. You know, Rocco Suffredini, these guys or, or a Manuel Ferrara like these guys. The men impressed me more than the women just because they have to keep their dick hard. I don't know. A lot of the newer guys, I just don't really watch as much with big names, but the fact that these guys can function under these conditions, whereas my dick is very, very susceptible to having an issue.

Speaker 3:          01:59:19       Well, Preval Agora. There were real superstars, right? There were real guys who were just freaks and now there's like chemically enhanced superstars, but even with Viagara have lost heart on. It's like I haven't taken salice in over a month I think, and maybe it's been three, actually three or four months now. I just stopped because my dick was horrible without it. I'm like, I can't even with it, it was like my dick was kind of half mast and I'm like, you're training your body wrong. So I stopped taking you to talk to someone to give you that advice. Um, what to stop taking it, you know, I just knew, I knew myself. I was taking it the wrong time and I wasn't even horny and I'm like, if you need one, take it, but I haven't been sold. So you were relying on its psychological? Oh God, yeah, all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:59:55       Like I thought there might be a chance that night I'd pop one alice, go to the seller and hope for the best was too optimistic sitting there with a boner. Yeah, I mean it just. And it would make you feel great, but I didn't need it. So I, I kept taking him. I didn't need. It sounds like a, what's a genius thing that nature has done to make it so that there's all these different factors that keep you from getting direct, right. Nervousness, fear, anxiety, which makes sense because you really shouldn't be concentrating. Like, because for, for a human male sex is so overwhelmingly interesting. Right? That you, if you could get it up in the face of danger, it would probably be terrible for your survival mechanism. Right? Right. Do you read a book called the midnight of Garden in the middle of the, uh, the good with the midnight in the garden of evil.

Speaker 3:          02:00:46       What was that? The Kevin Spacey was in the film, good and evil in the bid night gardener. So I'm fucking up. I know what you're talking about. Midnight in the garden of good and evil. Yeah. I never read that in the garden of Eden. I read the member of the movie. I don't, I. There was one thing in the book, I remember years ago, wow. Something happened and the guy's fucking the girl and like somebody came, they will fucking outdoors and there was a bad guy who was coming with a gun or something and she said what she remembered is that like they couldn't move, but she was like, I remember he stayed hard while he was inside me and he kept his erection. I don't even know if it's fiction or nonfiction. Something tells me it was nonfiction, but I could just be hoping. Um, I've always envied guys like that, but I'm not like, you know, I'm just, it's a funny thing to envy. Well, yeah, people who are healthy. I, I ended up health necessarily totally healthy. Right? Because you're really healthy. It'd be thinking about your own survival. Someone's got a gun to you. That's true. Well, no, he was

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       just in the area. He wasn't right, but yeah, but like the way you are or the way other guys are who are just like, hey man, I kinda liked this girl. And we connected and it feels right. Like those guys I, I envy. Are you ever completely comfortable? I'll give you ever like relaxed. Where you look totally no peace. Good question. No, and I've thought of that recently, like I'm not comfortable around my own friends. Like I love my friends. I'm comfortable around them but am other times I'm really comfortable yet sometimes on the radio when we're going back and they'd, when there's no time to think when there's like fucking six or seven comics in there and you're just being animals and everybody's moving and punching and shitting on each other and we're very comfortable because there's no time to reflect or think you just kind of doing what you do comfortably.

Speaker 2:          02:02:22       Um, but in that environment I'm, I'm, I, I realized that after like wow, I felt like just really alive and great in the moment, in the moment is exactly at flowing in a flow state doing something and not thinking. But when I'm thinking I'm always worrying about this, who the fucks me up and sexy, but I know I'm not comfortable too often, um, to do. Have you ever tried to be? Yeah. I don't know what to do. Like I think it's all shame based. So I'm trying to think if I talk about things that helps. Um, but if it doesn't it look, if it hasn't helped to the point where you're never comfortable now at 49, it's like, boy, this whatever this pattern is that you followed your whole life, right. Might not be the way to do it. I mean, I'm, I'm just guessing.

Speaker 2:          02:03:08       I think, you know, but that's a good point. I mean it's like, I don't know why I'm never comfortable. I'm not sure, but I'm not, but that's why I'm asking is asking you about yoga and that's what I wanted to ask you about meditation to just a wonder like maybe you can train your mind to relax when it comes to certain things or train your mind to not entertained so many neurotic thoughts or train your mind to concentrate on positive things and eventually build that up the same way you build up endurance. Like for like we were talking about those guys doing that exercise. We're circling a persons body like you burn yourself out unless you did it all the time. Or like my friend Cam will runs a marathon a day. He's used to it. He does it all the time. Like maybe you can do that also with your point of view.

Speaker 2:          02:03:48       Like maybe you can do that also with your mindfulness, with just thinking about the world itself around you that you could maybe not entertain those same thoughts, these neurotic thoughts. Maybe those thoughts. Maybe it's akin to like an endurance racer giving in to the idea of, of uh, discomfort and modern. I just quit now. Like maybe there's the same sort of thing. Maybe maybe these are mental patterns that you can sort of stray away from. Keep your mind on a positive track. I'm like, come up with some sort of like really good ways of thinking about things because you're obviously a very smart guy and you're in your, you're obviously a very sensitive guy. You think a lot, you know. But if you let that thinking and that sensitivity sort of run a muck without any control, without any discipline, that seems to be the issue.

Speaker 2:          02:04:34       And I've, I've had those issues myself in the past, which is one of the reasons why I bring it up. I mean I'm not, I'm way healthier now at this point in my life than I've ever been before because of really worked at it and worked at being at peace and being calm and, and then also I've worked at all the extraneous sort of influences that fuck with that and to sort of eliminate them and then do use exercise sort of as a drug in a lot of ways. Like there's a. One of the reasons why exercise so much is because if I don't, it's not like a looks thing. It's a mind thing. Like if I don't strain myself, if I don't, if I don't do something really difficult all the time, every day I do something five days a week, I don't do it everyday.

Speaker 2:          02:05:20       I have days where I take off, but if I take more than one day off, my body starts going, what are we doing? What are we doing? It's almost like you have a dog that you don't walk your dog. No, I know that when you. This is why one of the reasons why I thought about it way back in the day because my dog would be so much calmer if I went and played with them for a few hours, so if I took her for a walk and threw the ball and he ran around, he be chill, but if I did, he'd be like, come on, what's going on? It's like, do I have a neurotic dog? No, I have a dog that doesn't get any exercise. He has physical requirements for him to be content and I think people have physical requirements for them to be content too, but I think unlike people or unlike dogs rather people can go on these sort of downward mental spirals of, of self hate, of self analysis, of a neurosis, neurotic thinking of you.

Speaker 2:          02:06:08       You can get yourself in these really bad patterns of like shitting on yourself or looking at yourself in a negative way. You know, and I think you tend to gravitate towards these negative things sometimes and then you, you realize it and then you bounce back. But it's like, what is causing you to gravitate towards them and why can you never achieve it? Just a few moments, like an hour or two. We just chill. We could just sit at home and just read a book and have a cup of tea and just. Do you ever feel like that? Were you just comfortable and relax? Watch a movie on Netflix and chill out. It's always restless if you tell it. The mental patterns and changing the physical stuff is what I gotta do first they bring the body and the mind will follow. So I have to stop doing certain things.

Speaker 2:          02:06:51       And this thing of not cheating on this girl is it [inaudible] I've not cheated on girls before when they were here, but she's not here yet and we're still in a relationship. And for me to not it it's miraculous that I'm not. And we had a fight recently and I almost did. I started fucking tech and I'm like, no, you can't see what you do. Sabotage things. And that's why you're so um, and I've been going kind of up and down lately. But it's like whenever you're not doing something you, it takes a while for you to adjust and go like, all right, when you feel something now you've got to feel it. You can't feel it. And then run and go on eroes. Do you ever go to a therapist? Oh yeah. Many, many others. One I went to, she was very nice, but once I started getting familiar with them, you know, there was one time I forget why I was really fucking

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       suicidal and I called her. I don't like calling a therapist. It was a bad day. And I was talking to her. What triggered it? No, it's usually the same stuff around feeling like a failure. It just the same shit that everybody has the same feeling like I'm worthless. So I talked to her and um, uh, she was being nice but she was not being helpful and I didn't want her to rescue me, but I wonder just simply to give some kind of an answer or trigger me to ask myself a question. As a therapist, do they trigger you to go, why am I doing? It's my fucking. That's what their job is. Nonsense. She was, she just not very good at it. No. She was like, yeah, no, I know. I know. Let's just kind of empathizing a little, but I'm like, I don't need you to fucking empathize with me.

Speaker 3:          02:08:17       I just need you to just give me a suggestion on something. Don't just be okay. This is where we're at. All right now. I'll see you next week. You really might not. You know what I mean? I didn't say that to her because I'm not, I don't like to, you know, I'm not a fucking emo girl, but I just was like, all right, whatever. Um, but I feel like I can't be in a therapist therapy with her anymore. Well, I think therapists are probably a lot like comics, right? There's really good ones and there's really bad ones. Ones that some people think are really good and you might think suck. You know what I mean? There's just, I haven't gotten yours. I mean a few years, but uh, I feel better now than I have in a long, long time. Like I'm happy now. I'm just, I'm fucked up lately because I'm kind of going through this huge change, but other than that I feel better than I have in a long time.

Speaker 3:          02:08:58       Like life is good. That's good. I love the radio show I'm doing. I have fun with Sam. Everybody really do like, you know, I enjoy working with Sam. He's a fucking goof ball and I have fun. I love doing the thing with Matt. Like I just, I have fun doing that stupid fucking chip is the biggest thing in my life and I love doing it. But character, why is that? The people love it. Like the podcast they're going to hate this week because we did it in La and the women didn't know chip was and it was very ugly experience last week. They would just from that. This uh, Maria Menounos, his boyfriend, Kevin Undergaro, he runs this place. They do all these after show. He's a huge chip fan. So he's like, Hey, while you're out here you can use my studio because I have a podcast because that's. I can't teach. It's a different hair every week. I can't look. I can't look at it. It's fucking humiliating. I love the face. You make me do it. A different wig on every week. Every week. Yeah. The glasses, those are glasses that Colin Quinn gave me to fuck. But it's, it's so awful. But the last one we released as a live one and it's the people we was an hour and 20 minutes long. We did it the village underground and it's sold out faster than anything I've sold in years.

Speaker 3:          02:10:09       It's fucking ridiculous character. You know what it is. And, and it was a fun shy at Collin, Anthony fucking Sam was on, um, uh, who have lost their fucking Bobby Kelly and it was just so silly. And the people I think is, it's almost like everybody's greatest fear is to be that on aware. Like that's a weird, like why do people like this? Because the joke stink if fucking terrible jokes. And they said with conviction, but she always has people around him who know him doing it this week in La was me and Sam and x park was on, who was a fun guy. But he knows me as the wrestler who fucked China in the porn. He was extra. There's a great guy. He, uh, means more than a guy who fuck China, but that's using the reference people have. Well no, but he knows Jim, so he's like, hey, check is trying to go with it, but he doesn't know what to do.

Speaker 3:          02:10:56       And these fucking four girls that have no idea because Kevin wanted it to be a train wreck. Fucking fucking Kevin Underdog. He wanted to be a train wreck. So he had these girls. He didn't tell him a little while, go here, Jim Warren's going to be there to huge podcast from New York. So I fucking do it. And they're trying to go with it and chip just an abrasive. They didn't know what to do. I was the only time I've ever been humiliated doing chip. I was embarrassed and uncomfortable. And I also like, this is what it's supposed to be. This guy stinks when you supposed to be disliked because people were in on the joke, loved the joke, you know? And, and they get that the jokes are awful. So the fun point with people who love it is to, at times give one, like my ex girlfriend really new chip and there was times I would do a is so bad.

Speaker 3:          02:11:44       And she was like, oh, that's fucking terrible. Like she loved. Don't you think that the people that love chipotle actually love this episode then because it's chip interacting with people who have no idea who he is. If they really love chip, if they understand who chip jepperson really is, they're going to go fucking bananas. I can't even watch it. Dude. I can't watch it. I was embarrassed because Sam, you with me. I'm like, dude, is it that? And he goes, it was really uncomfortable. I'm now I'm compelled people to get it. There are people who really who didn't videotape it to, oh, we videotape every one ion video and it's on Youtube for free. Like, I waited on itunes as well, all for free. I make a little money from the Ed and I said, I want to charge with the video. I want to do something with it someday. I don't know where it will go. We've only been doing it a few months. Um, you know, I think that this is like, I've 25 episodes. We do one a week. He does live reads. Yeah. Give me some volume. Fucking slammed Ya Dad fucking head. I'm call. Watched it go.

Speaker 3:          02:12:54       Was that fun? Love. You look like a Honolulu. Hipster. Yeah. What's that say? Fucking Honolulu. Hipster. Fucking upstate New York. You have pizza, garbage, Honolulu in Hawaii, you know, stupid

Speaker 5:          02:13:16       nonsense.

Speaker 3:          02:13:19       Now, when did you, you came up with this character when you were on. Oh, and a what? What made you do this? Like girlfriends hated it. I think we talked with his girlfriend drove me. They hated it so much because it was humiliating and I, it got a reaction out of them and I just kept doing it so much. It was so much fun. And a lot of times I, anthony, like at first hated it, but then anthony started to love it. But then opie never loved it. It was always kind of fun to do because I knew like deep down uncle Paulie hates. So I would always do uncle Paul just to fucking make him sick because he couldn't get with uncle Paul. Anthony, of course. Could you more comfortable now doing it without him? The radio show? Much much Yo. Yeah. We stopped liking each other.

Speaker 3:          02:13:58       I mean, the reality is we are, you know, I really mean I don't wish the guy bad in his real life, like I don't want bad shit to happen to them. But uh, we simply stopped liking each other. So, um, but he, he was enjoying his afternoon show much more without me. Then he was with me. Um, I got the morning spa, spa or whatever, you know, um, I think the company just was annoyed at him or whatever they like to be in San. We're hungry. But his afternoon show was good. I mean, uh, you know, he, him and shirod and those guys, they were having fun. So people didn't like it, they didn't like it, but he sounded like he was having fun and he was looking at him fired. Like what, what happened, what the technical reason was, was um, he had filmed role in campus.

Speaker 3:          02:14:37       Our booker taking a shit. Um, now I know, Oop, well he filmed me doing it in 2009, but he was being a goofball. I don't think he was trying to be degrading just being an ass and then I'm showing it to I think a couple of the comics and I guess I don't know exactly. I heard about it after the ball had already been rolling, so somehow role and got nervous that he was going to release it and maybe with tea, I don't know what role he said to them, I really don't, but I think that it got back to one of Roland's bosses and then the head of the talent department spoke to them and then once human resources got involved then things change. And I remember there was a clip of it was getting bad and there was another producer in the studio named Paul and he was videotaping it and I think he had been unrolling side and he thought he was being a dick to him.

Speaker 3:          02:15:27       He's going to be a dick to me. Nobody's like, yeah, because you chose rolling in this whole thing, like making it a public thing. That was really uncomfortable. And then Paul goes, yeah, well I thought it was wrong. And then she, rod goes like, ah, he was having fun. We all saw the tape, he was enjoying it, he was laughing and when I heard that, I'm like, oh no, he just said we all saw the tape. So other like that just made it. And again, maybe they were going to fire them anyway, I don't know, like they don't tell me that shit. Um, but he thinks that the company was out to get him.

Speaker 3:          02:15:57       I don't know. And again, I kind of know what they said to him privately, but to me he had two months left on his deal and no company wants to fire you two months out because. Because the potential lawsuits loss, they would much rather let you ride it out and then just not resign. You will serious isn't a weird place because of podcasts. Yes. I mean it's just a very weird place that the idea of paying money for these talk shows that are going to get interrupted by commercials and to have to listen to them only when they come on and not have them on demand. It's such an inferior distribution where they demand like now

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       now they're on demand is getting your phone an hour after it's up. You can get it an hour after it's but live you can listen live on the phone and get it to. What I'm saying is on your radio, like if you're in your car and you, you, you can't just pick. I want to listen to Tuesdays opie and Anthony Show or Jim Norton and Sam show. I can't just pick that. I don't know if you can, unless you have a phone, it might be a way to do it. That phone hooked up. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Right. But I don't think you could do that. Like Sirius radio is only playing what's playing right now? I think so far I don't know her. I mean I don't have a thing where I could just pick an episode. How is the podcast played in a car? You could just get.

Speaker 2:          02:17:12       There's a bunch of different ways. One, you can do it where you could stream it live through youtube. Some people do that and you just play the audio and if you have it setup, you can play the video. Some people do it where you, uh, you're on stitcher, stitcher is a low bit rate version, meaning it's a, the audio quality's not as good because it's compressed, but it's way quicker to download. So if you have some sort of a plan where you want to get a less data per month, a lot of people use stitcher or they just get it off of itunes. But the thing about it is that you just, if you have your phone bluetooth up, you literally, all you have to do is press play and it'll immediately play like whatever episode like you to scroll through, scroll through our stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:17:54       If you go to Syria now too, on the new operating system, just like ask for it. Yeah, you could play it for Siri. But if you go through, have you ever done, do you use it? Do you use a itunes or a podcast APP? I never look at podcast standing by like my most recent ones. Of all the ones that I subscribe to that I can just take one, click it and boom, now it's playing. Yeah, I mean that's just, it's done differently on serious. Yeah. The APP you have to use. The on demand is pretty good, but it's, I think it's an hour after it as you can get it forever. I believe. I don't list. I don't really listen to the show. I mean I never listened to our show. Um, I listened to it on drives and like wow, I kinda like it.

Speaker 2:          02:18:34       Um, it's, it's new. We finally got anthony back in the building. I'm allowed to come on as a guest in the building. I fought for three years for that and literally right after he got fired, they let him anthony back in after. I hope you got fired. And I'm not saying that he kept them. I don't know. It could be really honest. I don't know. Um, I don't think that he actively kept him out. No. Do they know the real numbers? Like did they ever tell you how many people were actually listening? Never. I don't know if they know. I mean, I don't know how they would track that. They may, but they don't apply to me. It's like I really want to know will give us the negotiating power on a part of me is like, I really don't want to know, but the fact that we're getting raises, I think we're doing okay. Like I, that's the only way I can tell you right is that they, I know that they want to, to keep me every time the contract said okay, we must be doing okay. Um, but no, I don't know what the numbers are, just, it's amazing how quickly it became a different thing, you know, like, like I remember when Howard went to serious, it was like, wow, how Lulea finally we're going to get uncensored radio. And then

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       it became, well it's still just radio and still live in, now you have to pay for it and now it's 10 bucks a month. And mean he made out like a bandit. I mean he made ridiculous sums of money from it, but where's the future in that? It just seems like that's a, it's, it's like almost like investing in. I mean if you're, if you're someone who's got a piece of that, it's like where's that going? Like how are you going to keep. You can't even use it in a tunnel. You know, the thing with serious and this is this really the scary for job security, but they have really. Scott is good at getting big name talent, like a Beatles channel on all this stuff. They're good at getting good name, good name, a big name. People doing shows Ferguson's on their channel. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:20:08       I'm not a faction where it goes. We're all in faction now. Faction talk. Yeah. I hate the name [inaudible]. It doesn't say comedy, but whatever it is, what it is. It's us and then Camino and and then Ellis and then Craig and then Nick Depalo was a very funny show. Who's the lawyer? Nick is a fucking savagely funny guy. Love that guy. He's just a fucking raw fucking bark out a joke. Funny Guy like mick is. Here's the thing about nick. He's never afraid to try to be funny. Like I've done a lot of projects with them. We get tough crowd for two years. I've just done a shitload of stuff back, back, back, back like Nicholas fucking fire lines out and I've always admired him for that because sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but he's unafraid is a funny fucking dude and he's unafraid to bark stuff out and be who he is.

Speaker 3:          02:20:51       Like I love that. And he does a great show. He's a really surprisingly good radio guy. Like, but go into breaks and all that stuff. But yeah, Athens doing it for a long time with rd. Remember? That's right, yes, I was on the show, but I remember watching the one blow out that they had where nick was trying to do some read that they had already. Didn't just want it to kind of fuck off. You can't let it get to you like that. We've had the blow outs. I've been thRough them, I've seen them. Me and it never had one I love and one of my fucking. I just wrote the foreword to his book. I don't know, I'm supposed to say that, but too bad. I'm proud of it. I fucking love him. And he's doing a show with already now. Right. The a show, the fucking greatest name.

Speaker 3:          02:21:29       They had a great billboard for it and uh, it's really funny man. It's to listen to that. Do it for the, to the compound yet. How much does that cost? I honesTly don't know. I do pay for it though. He offered me a free one, but I'm like, oh, I'll chime in. I mean I'll fucking, I'll chip in and it's doing well. Framed that whole compound meal. Yeah. Yeah. He hasn't skipped a beat. His life is fucking doing great. Yeah. there's not a great thing to our their mugshot. They're real legit. Mugshots hilarious. They did it. Yeah. Compound media. I like how he called it compound media too because. Oh, look at the aaa show. A great poster. September fifth. Now. Can you get that on your phone? You can get it on an app. I have the anthony put it in the car. You can listen to it in the car.

Speaker 3:          02:22:08       He's a but yeah, he's. I love him too. He's one of my favorite people ever. He's literally somebody who I don't think I'll ever not be close to. There's no one create like I love sam. I love all these guys I've worked with, but anthony, that was a weird. It's a comic thing that happens when you're going back and forth, but some of this in energy you're exchanging and with do it. There are jim norton laugh compilations. I never lived on my own shit. I don't listen to the old show. I can't listen to it, but those I can listen to because they're all anthony just making me laugh. It's not me saying funny shit, it's anthony saying funny shit that every time fucking gets me. Like he would literally make me laugh like that wheeze laugh than an audience member gets. I'm like, I never get to fucking feel that way, but he's not even.

Speaker 3:          02:22:47       What's the craziest. he's not a standup. He's not a standup. He's done it a little bit, but in that rotating. Yeah, he tried it. A couple of [inaudible] in montreal a couple of years ago just to do it. Yeah, after he had been fired. oh my god. no, no, no. This is what opie and anthony were supposed to do, a show together to host a comedy show in montreal. I was part of the show, but I'll be at home for some reason. He flew home a day early, didn't want to do it, so I did it by himself and hosted the show and started shitting on the comedians and he was really funny. First time ever on stage. he was fucking funny. Wow. But in a, in a comic room. Patrice said that about him. He said, he said anthony can access funny faster than any person.

Speaker 3:          02:23:22       I've ever seen and patrice didn't hand out. You would not known as the big ol boy, that guy dolan out compliments again write down. There's not patrice is reputation, but anthony has that ability to reach in and grab funny from anywhere and he's as fast as any comic we've ever had on a. There's never been a comedian in there who was faster than him. They'd been as fast as him guys like patrice or burro genius, but there's no one has ever been able to go in there and run circles around anthony. It's staggering how fucking funny that. Yeah, it is weird. It's like he's a comic who never became a comic, but that's how I've always felt about being around him and he even said that about him and dice was shitting on opiod. Anthony when they had a few together, he was saying that that anthony is actually talented and he's actually almost like a comic, but he never did it.

Speaker 3:          02:24:04       He never did it. and anthony has an ability brewers and amazing storyteller to an amazing storyteller. Whereas aunt could do that about like he can literally tell you. he would talk about like, you know, being a tin knocker and stuff I have no knowledge of or interest in and, and he would have me on the edge of my seat listening to him talk about it. He just has a gift for explaining things anD for walking you through it. Louis has that. The ability to explain an amazingly interesting fashion and anthony can just jump in and out of voices and do impressions. I mean, I never get sick of rambling about him because I got to work with them for a fucking decade. I got to work with the funniest guy in the fucking world for a decade. Like, as much as it sucks that it's over, like I'm grateful.

Speaker 3:          02:24:43       I just want to do it again. One hundred percent. Have you thought about doing that? I would love to go with him and sam. I mean me and open don't get along anymore. Um, but I would love to have anthony with me and sam. But again, he's got his own show. It's not going to happen, but I love salmon. I have a very good chemistry and a comfort level. Like I, I like him and I trusted him on the air and with opiate just got bad. I'm not blaming him. It's like, hey, I always have the problem too. But what about you doing a show with anthony? Compound media, compound media. Is he get into a more enclosed environment than serious is and because of gigs and other things I got to promote. I just kinda, I wanted to stay and also serious pays more and I didn't want to negotiate against anthony.

Speaker 3:          02:25:18       I just couldn't. I was like, hey, I wasn't going to use him as a negotiation tactic. I didn't want to do. I couldn't do it. I'm too close to him and I always kind of secretly wanted him to come back. And when he came back the first day he came back. I mean it was seeing that fucking I got, I got the, we went to a springsteen know who played. Oh, guns and roses played at the fucking the apollo. So this was like right after opening it to fire. So I saw scott greenstein that night or andrew and like, Yeah, he can come in and kill me, and I'm like, really? They're like, yeah, you can come in. And I'm like, great. I texted him, come in tomorrow, the minute he could come in and uh, but security hadn't been told so I'm on the show and I know ants coming in.

Speaker 3:          02:25:55       It's gonna be a fucking surprise for the audience. But he's being held up at security because in fairness they needed an email from scott they didn't know that had been okayed and it took about an hour or 40 minutes, but he got up and seeing him walk down that ah, fuck. it was so good. He was happy. Very rarely see that on his face. It was so good. But, but you, you just go right back into that. And sam is so perfect in that moment till you just kind of go back into it and you flow and you know. So I miss him a lot, but uncensored conversations, they're just hard to come by. And When you're under the corporate umbrella, you're not really uncensored. There's always gonna be something that you can't say something, get you in trouble, which is why I was always encouraging you to do a podcast.

Speaker 3:          02:26:36       Like wait, even way back in the day, I was like, you should branch out and you should do something on the wrong side. I feel like people wouldn't. Why voice felt people wouldn't want it or they were sick of me or they're not interested. but again, the closest I've come at this point is fucking dumb. Chip, I made you my own sunday, but I, I'm literally loving doing that. It's freedom and it's fun. Do what you love then, but you know, I mean, I know you love doing the sam and jim show too, but I really feel like even that show would be bigger if it was just accessible to everybody and not on serious. It might be. And again, we have one more year left on the contract and it is something I would do as a podcast. It absolutely is something I would do as a podcast, but they don't want to say one thing in their favor.

Speaker 3:          02:27:15       Besides the fact that like, yeah, there's human resources and you know, you can't go around and fucking grabbing clits they never fuck with us creatively. Like literally never say nothing with condoleezza rice where you guys got kicked off the air. that was a homeless guy. Here's what that was, that your right to homeless charlie. And he's like, what? Bad? That bush bItch. He was just a funny fucking dude. Here's how that got pushed. That was before sirius xm merged and what sunk, what it will almost happened was that made it to fucking brietbart or breitbart and then got onto drudge and then became a big deal and I heard later that the people who were making that a story where the people who worked in terrestrial radio who did not want that merger to happen. So the only reason the company pulled him off if they were literally scared that it was going to hurt whatever they needed in congress for fucking two to make the merger.

Speaker 3:          02:28:06       Haptics. I'm serious. So they were saying it was a merger in danger. Like once that got out there and fucking either way, we shouldn't have been off the air, but I'm as crazy as it was, that's where terrestrial radio saved us because k rock who they wanted to be off the fucking show. Those cons. I hate that they wanted you. Yeah, because the ratings weren't as good as they used to be and they thought I was the probleM. Let's say. Hey fucking shit heads. I was there in the afternoon when we'd be for syndication. I was loving anthea before they're ever. I love people go like, yeah, dude, you suck. I remember philadelphia before you were on. No you don't. It didn't happen before I was on. There was no philly shell before I was on. I was always there and syndication, so whatever. anyway, they went to bergen once.

Speaker 3:          02:28:43       People are. I know, I know. I know. I know. I do that. I literally will do that alone. I, I, I don't. I didn't realize that people don't talk to themselves. I didn't realize that. And with chip and the character's eyes, and I've talked about this on our show, I do it all the time by myself. You have conversations with full blown chip edgar. Oh, full volume talking. I'll little them and character not once in a while if I think of something is dead. Girls say it in a lot of sector. Yeah. He's another one. He's a bad character and he's just has dry teeth. He said there's not a whole lot to them, but I would do them because anthony is, he touches you with a sharp fingernails. It's an ugly thing. Uh, and uncle paul, I, I do them. And you do them when you're alone.

Speaker 3:          02:29:27       Completely alone. Wow. And I do. When I'm alone, if I drop something, I'll go, oh, okay. That's about it. I'll walk around and talk to myself and full blown conversation like, uh, this, this is not. I have actually embarrassed this. I took a shit today and I got up and I was done and I, I went to the fucking to look at my computer and I had to shit again immediately. And I stood up and out loud. I said, oh, that's just jostled a little more loose, and I walked back to the toilet. I said those words to myself alone. I do it all the time, dude. I talk and I didn't know. I thought everyone did that, but sam's like, no, I'll think things, but I don't say them. Yeah, I would imagine most people think things, but a few people talk to themselves.

Speaker 3:          02:30:10       I'm sure I've done it on occasion, but it's not a normal in the shower. I do it out loud just for conversation to me when I'm alone, I'm happy to not talk. I talked so fucking much. I talk so much doing a podcast so much doing stand up so much doing ufc commentary when I can not talk at all. I'm fucking happy. Yeah. I don't know what it is. It's like things that just kind of come out or I work through things or I worked through this girlfriends argument, you know, whatever it is in the moment, and I logically talk things through, but yeah, that's where a lot of the characters should come from is. I'll start thinking of it and I'll talk in a weird voice and there'll be something that resonates with me and I'm like, I'm stuck in my head man. And once It's stuck in my head down, I bring it out on the air and that's when it gets stuck in everybody else's head.

Speaker 3:          02:30:52       Like if it's bothering me for a month, it's, you're going to hate it, you know? And I like to bring that stuff out. That's what I have to check comes from just being single and lonely. I've got to wrap this up. Okay. There will be so much fun with joe. Always a good time, brother. AnytIme you're in town, man, just let me know. Let's do this more often. Can I play my nearly room? Only all tickets are on sale if you want to go. And uh, I'm in dallas and austin this week and the money's going to the hurricane victims. I hate saying that. It feels cheesy, but I feel worse going into prostituting tickets, right? Um, and uh, go to the, a check being sam out or go to jim norton.com and I'll go to the chip. Chip person, riot casts, youtube has all the chip podcasts up there and uh, this one, this week is going to be a fucking doozy. thanks norton. Ladies and gentlemen.
