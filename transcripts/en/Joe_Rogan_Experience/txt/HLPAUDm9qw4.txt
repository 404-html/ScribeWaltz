Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. Let's take like it's just one small example of like how my belief system works about this. Uh, there's this one thing called the accumulation mindset. I call it, uh, I work online with people on fat loss programs and when you really look at their lifestyle, their into the z accumulation mode of just buying an amassing all of this stuff. I've been in some people's homes where the shelves are just littered with stuff they never use or don't need. You know, they, they just have so much stuff. The attic is full of stuff, the garage is full of stuff, but they keep buying more and more adding, adding, adding, adding. The body's reflect this type of belief system and for sure they're adding more cells under their body. Just indulge it, you know? And then they find themselves over eating, eating more than their fair share of the natural resources of the universe. Taking more n a, I mean it's just like this whole belief system in accumulation. Like I need to add, I need to add is all subconscious. Of course, no one goes into it.

Speaker 2:          01:03          You know, how much do you sleep? Maybe now that I'm, I'm doing all this crazy stuff. Uh, three hours. Three. It was a lot. Wow. What do you normally sleep if you weren't doing that? If I'm lucky. Wow. Four hours. Maybe we'll you're juiced up on nicotine dollars, Huh? No, it has to do with, I have to worry of the editing. Like, you know, like I have to do the notes at night so that they can edit during the day. And then I go in at night and then now like with all these, like with radio as you know, like radio and all that stuff, it's like this is a weird schedule. It's all of that. And then doing shows at night, because I never stopped doing shows. Right, of course. But I meant like, when you're not doing this and you said five hours, five hours maybe. Is that because you're all juiced up with nicotine all the time? I think cause I'm old and my prostate tells me it's time to get up. I take a leak five hours and you're good. Um, if I'm lucky, you know, get some palm palm juice. Have you tried some of those pills that help? What is this doctor? Oz Guinness. It's shit.

Speaker 2:          01:57          It's like we were just watching heavy metal and there's like a Caribou carcass here. It's like, have you ever thought of like who gives a shit? It's part of getting old guys. Get used to it. Get used to it. Joe, you're old enough to start now and not have any probably any problems from smoking. You'll tried out for a year. You would never saw anybody who was an athlete in their youth or like stole is involved in athletics? Like smoking is a no, my cardio was very important to me. Yeah. Yeah, I understand that. You know, never fuck around with that, but I'd get it. I do love like, uh, you know, smokers do like, I'm just talking about like my dad and his friends, like they would have amazing like smokers superpowers where it's like, no, they couldn't do anything. But like if there was like something like, you know, hey, I need your help. What happened? My car fell in a ditch and like they would just come out with a cigarette in the mouth and like lift up the, I was like, man, that's so cool. You know there's a diaper that they're selling now.

Tell him, tell him the story about how, how you wrote your training with our lasky after training where he's, he goes, come here. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, Andre Arlovski and I used to train together, uh, Jackson's camp and I was getting ready for a fight this over shoot almost four years ago. The two fighters that I, when I first got into the game that I admired and loved where Mirko Cro, cop and Andrea are Laski by two very favorites. That's who I wanted to be like. So I walked in the gym and it was our lost keys first day at Jackson's too. And uh, you know, when you seen a guy in TV fighting all the time, then you run into me like, damn, all right. So I see him like, Oh shit, this under lawsky.

So me and him are gone and it's, it's a close round. He's a Badass, right? I'm are going back and forth. People would literally stop and watch a spar were just these dog rounds back and forth, five rounds in a row. Then later that night we grapple and then the next morning I drink coffee every morning. Right. Or drinking coffee, not this horrible coffee breath, breath smell like pure coffee, shit breath. Right. And I'd go up to Andre and he's, he's not very warm person at all. Nope, not at all. Is that very Belarus rush in where it's going to take a while to be his friend? I can tell and I'm trying to break these barriers, man. I don't know. Hey Brah just wanna let you know, man.

Speaker 1:          06:13          I got the coffee breath and he, uh, he didn't say a word to me the night before training goes, it's okay. It's okay. Much better than yesterday. Yesterday. Shit. I go, what? He goes yesterday, breast smelled like Shit. Oh cool man. Cool. And then just went about our business. That was really the only words he ever said to me, man. We trained together for a while. It wasn't even like from, what about when you were kicking, when you had your kick his body? Yeah. And then we'll get done a train. I've never done this. He goes, ah, I'm trying to do my best Russian accent it, you guys are pretty much terrible. That's horrible. Right? Okay. Sorry, I'm not from Russia. He goes up, he goes, put your hands on top of your head like this. And I'm like, what are we doing? And we just got done sparring. I'm exhausted, right?
