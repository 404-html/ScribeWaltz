Speaker 1:          00:00:00       The call, is that okay? Is that comfortable? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       That's where there's a constant debate as to whether or not the headphones on the way to go because the headphones or the only way that you can hear exactly what other people are going to hear when they listen to the podcast so you can kind of review it while it's happening. Like if only I wear headphones than it feels weird like I'm interviewing. Yeah. Yeah. And it seems kind of to focus my attention just on the. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come back, man. Good to see Dublin from maps. That's for whatever reason, that acronym. I always stumble with Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. Yes. Yeah, and actually I was just yesterday with and today with Ralph Metzner and I got the name from him in a way. He wrote a book, maps of consciousness and I needed a name for the organization that had a p in it for a psychedelic and so I was looking around for words that had a p in it and maps and I really liked what Ralph did and with Tim and robbed us and the rest and say, I thought maps.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       It helps explain a territory. Yeah, well you guys are so important when it comes to the dialogue of psychedelics because from an outsider, this is how I always viewed maps. Maps is always like, oh, those are the actual really smart dudes during the psychedelics because there's someone who wacky fuckers out there in the world of psychedelics and they want to bring you crystals and talk to you about channeling and I know a healer and there's so much going on. That's so crazy. And then there was science and then there was people doing actual peer reviewed studies. There's actual scientists involved. There was real data and you guys were pursuing it the right way and I was like, oh, these guys are so important because there's not a lot of people that. That's one of the weird things about psychedelics. You could tell people that you went out and drank whiskey until your feet went numb and you shit your pants and no one cares, but if you tell people that you got together with some friends and you took a naturally occurring psychedelic drug and you explored your consciousness and you're so much happier now and you feel better about life and you're more optimistic if you do that, you're some fucking wacky hippy Druggie, some loser.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       Well that's the perception and so we've got this coming out and we've looked at other social change movements like gay marriage and gay rights and it comes from people coming out because there are loads of smart people that do psychedelics or talented or emotionally wise and they just keep it quiet so people don't really know who in society has had these influences and they don't have to keep it quiet. Either. It's jobs think that their employees for some reason would be better off if they didn't do certain drugs, certain jobs. I think that's crazy. The idea that they get to control your body when you're not there is just crazy. Yeah. But if you look at the companies like facebook and Google

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       and all these tech companies, they don't do drug tests. They're better. Nah, they don't lose everybody. Yeah. They know the pot test. Oh good Lord. Oh my God. They would lose. The entire company would come back with a real straight laced republican trump supporting. Yeah. Yeah. So the, the innovation and psychedelics and marijuana and looking at things in different ways. People are getting to appreciate that. I think more the culture is changing while we're in these camps. You know, we have these camps, the do's and the don'ts. Do you take drugs, do not take drugs and you know, and there's a lot of people that pride themselves on one or the other, whether they're a perturber or non perturbed, you know there's, there's people that get weird about people that are doing things other than what they're doing. They don't like it. Yeah. And that's why we need this kind of coming out.

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       Yeah. So we were having these global psychedelic dinners, and this is our 30th anniversary actually, tomorrow is the 30th year that I started maps in 1986 and we're asking people to, um, in their own homes or with their friends to invite people over and then have them tell stories of what psychedelics have meant to them or what their hopes are for psychedelic research. So you're inviting everyone to do it, like on a, like to make a night of it. Yeah. And it's like a Holiday Inn. Yes. Yeah. During April, during the month of April. Generally you're creating your own holiday. It's, well, there's people that have done this before. There's, with conversations about death with dinner and drugs with dinner event. So they try to promote conversations in safe places, but where people feel comfortable to really be more honest and they can open up. And so it's kind of modeling on that and then it hopefully helps people to come out even more.

Speaker 3:          00:04:53       I mean, we even have like a twitter, uh, um, it's a Hashtag psychedelics because so people can write in and just say psychedelics matter to me because, or you know, I, I'm, I am more hopeful or I'm, you know, feeling that multigenerational trauma can be addressed through. Isn't that incredible that, that is one of the best things for it. Is Mtma one of the best things as far as getting over traumatic experiences is an illegal drug. Yeah. And yet there's a carved out area that we've been able to make legal which is the research area and it's because science is the vehicle in our culture that we trust more religion than our religions. And so it felt like science and healing where the ways into the culture that was freaked out by psychedelics in the sixties and now because of these crises we're in and also these tools that can be shown to be really helpful and that people have made life's out of them, that it's not hurt them. It's helped them, but people don't it. So that's where we think the research is helping people create a space where they can talk about it.

Speaker 4:          00:06:04       Well, I think it's people are starting to understand the true nature of these things instead of the propaganda. Then they're doing it from people like yourself being really honest about their experiences and people like yourself. Even more importantly, [inaudible]. There's not a lot of people like you that have actually gone out and pursued all of the significant scientific data on psychedelics and the beneficial properties to it so that we can understand like we have this idea about a thing. Forget it. Put all your ideologies. Decide whether you're a right wing or left wing. We have an idea about a thing that's not correct and this idea about a thing is that there's a certain group of consciousness adjusting substances that are for losers. They're for dumb people there for fools and don't you mess with those and everybody who does those is lazy and Stinky and wet and you'll lock there like people. There's a lot of people that automatically lock into that pattern of thinking. That's their go to for for any drugs. Anything that's not legal, but yet those same people oftentimes will drink. They have no problem doing that, and they allowed times they'll take pills to which, which is even more bananas. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:07:17       There was this idea that drugs are marijuana hurts. Your Iq says there has been to prove it. Is that true? Well, the arrows, a study, the national institutes of health just two weeks ago had a conference in Washington at the NIH headquarters. The head of Nih was there, the head of night at the head of Nih, national institute mental health about marijuana and cannabinoids, and it was a neuroscience review and they presented results that suggested that there was a heavy marijuana smokers that started early in their lives over, um, this was done in New Zealand over like a 20 year period. Had some differences. Lower Iq than there

Speaker 4:          00:08:00       control groups. Well, if you're talking about people that are smoking marijuana heavily, one of the things that I would say is that if you're smoking marijuana heavily, you're not going to do a whole lot of thinking. You're going to zone the fuck out. You're going to do a lot of zone. And out and while sober people might be absorbing more information, you're probably often worldly Iran all day long. That's not necessarily healthy. I think all psychedelic drugs. C should be an enhancer, but they shouldn't be in replace of like, you shouldn't say, you know, I'm just going to be high from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep every single day and this is how I exist. I'm just high all the time. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Take a break, man. Yeah, I had that

Speaker 3:          00:08:43       sense of as in my early twenties, so smoking all the time to be high, high, high. And I enjoyed it and I felt that got me into things that got me really into physical work and labor. Really? Yeah. Fun and exercise.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       Fantastic. I mean that's the opposite of the couch potato idea, you know, that people have. But pod and exercise. I'm just men. I ran the New York marathon. Willow stones. That's amazing. That's amazing. Tired in the middle. And I walked into a Porta potty and smoke some. We jump back in. Oh my God, that's a great story. Delirious lot of Jujitsu people smoked pot for Jujitsu. It's a big one. Snowboarders. Snowboarders. Love it. Yeah. Snowboarders. They say basketball players. Yeah. They say that. It's one of the things about the NBA, it's like you better not be testing for weed because these dudes it when it would make sense too, because I don't play basketball, but I play pool and it's, it's, um, one similarity that they share is that it's about touch and feel and touch and feel is way enhanced. A lot of the best pool player is also smoked pot.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       You know, this guy, a full blown up his spot to spot. This is a video of me doing an impression of him and he's like a genius. Fuck fucker. They'll say it seems earl strickland, he's a genius pool player and I, he might have occasionally enjoyed marijuana. That's all I'm saying. But um, these guys, like they say that, um, when, when they're smoking pot and playing, you can see things better. You have a better sense of where the ball's going. You have more sensitivity as far as how far it rolls. Yeah. I used to play racquetball a lot in handball and a lot and sometimes I would play stoned and sometimes I, when I was, she did have that deeper sense of being in the moment. You were just one step, instant more into the moment as and predicting and knowing and just um, but I could never, there was an unpredictability about it so I could never really tell if I would play better or worse.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       That's probably why you play good because you're never sure and you just stayed on the edge. You know, there's a thing, there's an ego dissolve in quality of any of these psychoactive substances and I think that ego dissolve in quality gives you more space to move around with all your other focuses. That's my theory about it because I always felt like, like with Jujitsu, you definitely feel better at Jujitsu when you're high. And I was trying to figure out why. Well, you also feel like you somehow or another you feel more more vulnerable yet you do better. Like you're more like, like kind of freaked out by any aggression or more trying to avoid any sort of conflict. That's what the driving studies of marijuana and drivers show that people know that they're slightly impaired and they take defensive measures and they drive slower and more aware of the possibilities of error as well.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       Yeah. Yeah. And you're correcting for it and you drive more carefully. I think that's the part that we have to really be the experts on the risks as well as the benefits. Yeah, definitely. That we can't ignore that. There are both sides of it for sure. With edibles, edibles and driving settled down to police settle down. Are you sure? You sure that's a good idea. Yeah. Although I think the idea we need to do is more move to performance tests rather than drug tests and then that's really directly what you're concerned about and then you need people's behaviors to themselves, but you checked their real performance, not these indicators or predictors. Yep. From my personal experience, there's a big difference between how you understand and operate under it as like someone who's been smoking pot for like 15 years versus someone who's been smoking pot for like a week or a month or even a year.

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       Like there's a difference in sometimes your ability to handle being really high like you, your anxiety takes hold of you because you're like, oh my God, and you start freaking out. Then you can't drive, you can't do anything. And then there's people who that are just, oh Geez, like that action Bronson Character Action Bronson came in here. This motherfucker smoked like nine joints in the entire time he was here. He just kept smoking and I had to tap out. I sit back and watch and he just never slowed down. He kept going in and kept lighting that fucker up. I'm like, this guy's insane. But like a dude like that, that guy can handle being high. He understands how to be high, but for someone who's not really that experienced that it man, especially in a car, it's not a good idea. Yeah, for sure. It's got to be.

Speaker 1:          00:13:44       Again, if you can just focus on performance and it can. It takes a while to get used to it. I think what my point was, the performance varies considerably dependent upon the individual, so I don't think you could even do like an across the board performance tests, like say, Oh, we've shown that this guy under five joints can do BMX flips because a lot of those bmx dudes, they could do that shit drunk too. You know what I mean? Yeah. I didn't have to be an individual examination. Yeah. The the part that I really liked about exercising and playing racquetball with marijuana is that sometimes it would be so easy to forget the score and then you realize you're not really playing for the score. It doesn't really matter and you're just so into the moment and playing. Just Joanne. Yeah, just enjoying their movements and there is this competition, but it's about helping each other do your best and then the score.

Speaker 1:          00:14:35       Yeah. That's the one downside of, you know, your height. I'll try and keep track of the score. You needed someone there who's sober to hire someone to do with a clicker, but we can't be bothered. Man. Will you just give each of the participation trophies like they're doing with kids today where everybody gets a trophy? Don't worry about the score. Just play. Just keep playing. Good one. I don't know. I think this idea though of science and the being rigorous about things. Yes. Yeah. I mean I saw something that you did about the aliens and I thought you did. I'm like a TV documentary. I thought you did great about it. Thank very. Yeah, I was impressed. The alien. Listen, man. Nobody wants to believe more than me. Nobody wants to be more than me. Believe me. I fucking want to believe, but when I'm honest and I look at all the evidence, it's not their folks.

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       There's nothing there. There's nothing there. There's like a few people have seen some stuff. There's some people that wrote affidavits. Other than that, you got nothing. You got some shaky ass pictures. That could be anything. Could be a bird that got shot out of a cannon. We some of these photos that they're convinced or from another planet like, are you fucking serious? Man? I think it'd be anything. He knows what that is. I think the bigger question is if it's true, then what? Yeah, and that's what I've tried to look at and so for me, if it's true that there's aliens from here somewhere else that are here, what would I do differently in my life? Do I really need to solve that mystery? Which doesn't seem very compelling. It doesn't seem likely, but it wouldn't. I think it's a way to be connected to something broader.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       It's like a spiritual urging. I think it's a. it's like a secular Jesus. Yeah, that's a really think it is and I don't think I'm the only one. It's not like I don't even think this is my theory. I think other people definitely thought this up that there's some sort of a connection between people that don't want to believe in religion and don't want to believe in any sort of ancient ideologies, but they desperately want some superior and so they reach out to the skies and some of them get fixated on the idea of maybe even they have been personally visited because it makes them more significant. It gives her life a bit more meaning, you know you were chosen, were testing, you were trying you out conveniently, always while you're dreaming, but trust me, dude, it's really happening. You're not just sleeping and dreaming something crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:17:02       No, you are actually on a spaceship and so you get these people that are kind of delusional and when you look at the sheer raw numbers of people in this country and then you look at the Ufo story stories and go, how many of these people could be delusional? Could it be all of them? Could it be some of them? Could it be most of them? What's the real number? And that was the the cold hard thing that we got to on that Scifi show because it doesn't discount the possibility of definitely not of extraterrestrial life and definitely not of people being visited. It's entirely possible that extraterrestrial life has visited or observed us and there was a unique unique moment where someone was there and witnessed it and maybe even those in contact with them and then they took off and they were gone and they never returned again. That is entirely possible because that's entirely

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       what we would do if we could just go from planet to planet as dumb as we are now. If we could just go from planet to planet and do studies, fuck yeah, we would do it and if we found an intelligent life form that was like more primitive than us, like cave people, like some 2001 with the monolith, you know, if we found something like that, you don't think we'd go say hi. Of course we would say hi. We would definitely say hi, and then we jet back off at our fucking sleep machine off into the skies. We would do exactly what we think they would do. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:18:20       you could make the case that we already know by looking at these tribes in the Amazon that are as if living cave men without much contact and we try more and more now just to let them alone. But when you go there, they're wearing Nike's fucking Koby Bryant tee shirts on Dev. Like mickey mouse hats. I mean, it's weird. You see these people in the jungle and they have all this western clothing and you're like, wow, it's so weird, but yet they're living like an indigenous tribe. Yeah. There's very few that are still pretty uncontacted primitive and I actually did a pod ceremony one time with some native American church Shaman to how many people can say that and, but, but, but, but this was, a bunch of people can say that, but they wanted to see what a friend of mine who was helping them with their sheep was, uh, using [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       It seemed to help him get stronger and it was Mtma and so some novel, it wouldn't. When they would go off and do a pod ceremonies somewhere else, he would tend to their animals, sheep, ecstasy. No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. No. Was it, did you understand what he was saying? The. Okay, I skipped those. Just trying to follow. I think we might've gone too deep for this episode that I'm, a friend of mine was living out with the Navajos to kind of get his head straight. Okay. And he would help take care of their animals when they, this male female shamans both would go off to do pod ceremonies. Oh Wow. He stayed out there for about a year and he kind of put himself together and they said, what helped you and we're interested in what your medicine is. And he said it was Mtma.

Speaker 3:          00:20:06       And they said, well we'd be interested in trying to experience Mtma. So I was invited out there and we ended up doing this ceremony in a Navajo and they only spoke Navajo. They didn't speak English at all. And there was this like in the western movies there was try a trail of dust coming in. Somebody came on horseback to be our translator and it was there. It was their 17 year old niece. Holy Shit. And she came to mediate during this mtma experience and it became clear that this was really for her, not so much for them to, for, for, for them to show their seminar, who, who's torn between the different cultures that, that something about our culture. We wanted what they had or was we saw and respected it. Wow. And the and a lot happened in and the, it was wonderful in all different ways and there are some important healings, but in the morning, um, when we were going, this young woman was going to get back on her horse and she had 17 magazine and was reading it and that's where I started figuring out that, you know, even out in the reservation in these protected culture is that the globalization of ideas and Internet and five casts and people are being exposed to ideas that they wouldn't have normally been exposed to even in China.

Speaker 3:          00:21:47       I mean, they're having to do so much just kind of sensor stuff. Yeah. There's an explosion of thinking and ideas going on right now. It's a very strange, strange time. Yeah. I'm going to come to that and I think people are getting unsettled because things they had thought were true and rigid. Part of their frameworks are, are different than other places. And how many people speak Navajo? Exclusively. There's a bunch.

Speaker 4:          00:22:10       That's insane. I didn't even know that that existed. I didn't know that inside of this country's, there were entire cultures of people that speak in the original native language. Wow. Yeah. I didn't know that existed.

Speaker 3:          00:22:23       Well, it's probably very, you know, thin at these upper generations because the, the, your younger ones are

Speaker 4:          00:22:30       arguably the best sounding. Their language is like the coolest sounding language ever. It's got that vendor, you know, there's like a, a sound to it. Like there's something to their accent that just A. I guess it's like we're programmed to think of native Americans. It's like spiritual and authentic, you know, there's like this sound to it. Like, do you remember that scene with Clint Eastwood? Was it the outlaw Josey Wales where he met that Indian chief and they got together and these are my words of life and also my words of death. Do you remember that speech Jamie did? I'm talking about dude, you got to find the. Is so powerful. It's like one of my favorite moments in a movie. I mean, those clinics should. Movies were all ridiculous, right? Like when you stop and look at it is they're all ridiculous, but there was something to that genre that spaghetti western genre because it, it wasn't just that it was, there were cool action movies, but it was cool action movies that were in some ways reminding you of how people lived just a hundred years ago because these were all in the 19 sixties and seventies and shit.

Speaker 4:          00:23:41       Right. That's when they did these fucking movies will visit the 19 in 1870. They were riding fucking horses everywhere. I mean this literally is a hundred years old, you know, 18, 65, they abolished slavery. We're only talking about a hundred years and this cowboy western shit was going on and for us it, it almost like hearkens to a time right before we fucked up the country. Right when the first barometers on wooden wheels rolled their platforms covered in tarp across the entire continent to find a spot to have babies. Not that it was like this perfect paradise for got here. Definitely wasn't. Yeah, that's a. that's an interesting perspective that some people grab onto that the native American people were completely a piece where each with each other, they definitely weren't. There are amazing. It's nothing to take away from their cultures and I'm. I'm fascinated by native American culture.

Speaker 4:          00:24:41       It's just an amazing place that they existed on and for so long without any European influence, while all this stuff was going on in the world, they were living here in a very, very different way in a lot of ways and intensely harmonious way with their environment, with, with nature itself and I think we like look at that and we have all these deep spiritual attachments to that. It's like it's like it means it's very significant, but they fought amongst each other so much and that was their sport in a way that they had that as killing. It was. It was a way of becoming trained as a Predator and somehow that's so deep in us and that's part of the question. I think for me, the psychedelics and therapy is. Is there a way to get that out of the human heart? In a way?

Speaker 4:          00:25:30       I think the way to get it out as the way that it's getting out right now, and it's through information, I think that when even you look at these native American tribes that were harmonious with each other, right? They have these very close knit bonds and close tribes and they're very communal, but they didn't know these other people that were exactly like damn. There were a hundred miles away and they assume the worst and they assume the worst too, and they looked at each other and there was not enough communication. They couldn't. They couldn't interact with each other instantaneously. They couldn't get to understand each other. Like we've talked about this on this podcast before, but if it wasn't until like about a hundred years ago where a boat showing up didn't mean. I mean if you were in the 18 hundreds and a strange boat pulled up on shore, you're Foxville right?

Speaker 4:          00:26:16       This is a terrible problem. These are monsters with swords and they're gonna jump off and they got to shoot arrows at us. That was really common. If you got a boat that showed up a giant boat and a bunch of people got off your fuck man, you just got invaded now that means terrorists and you want tourist dollars and people have translators on their phones so they could speak to each other that people that speak different languages, I mean is, this is an amazing time. Ms Dot amazingly strange, but we're experiencing each other on a much more even playing field than ever in the past. And I think that's how we can exist with so many of them.

Speaker 3:          00:26:54       Yeah. And I think if we can see that really we're all more in common than we have different and we can appreciate the differences rather than be fearful of them. And that what we have in common is this fundamental sense of connection of being this web of life that really were not virtually were pretty similar to animals. You know, her way close the people at different skin or different cultures to be able to see that that is who we really are. And that acting from that and trying to um, work on cooperative solutions. And I think that that's, if we can have lots of people having these direct experiences so that they can't be manipulated by politicians. So it's about grounding this kind of globalization, but comfort with the sense of a connection that, that were

Speaker 4:          00:27:57       able to find these bonds that they do exist and that they can be built. But I think one of the things that we're seeing in this extreme oversensitivity that we're experiencing right now, there's, this is like a really interesting time as far as like pc culture and what's, what you can do, what you can't do, and cultural appropriation. I mean, people are going after people for cooking Mexican food that aren't Mexican. Yeah. We're trying to call that guy cultural appropriation. We're trying to do,

Speaker 3:          00:28:25       take a Iowasca out of the, uh, Iowasca rituals and out of the jungles and turn it into a therapy drug. But that's out of respect. It's not out of.

Speaker 4:          00:28:37       Well, that's, that's an interesting analogy. It's a different thing and in a lot of ways. But yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:28:44       Yeah, I mean, culture is, can evolve. You just have to be acknowledging where it comes from and try to bring you back.

Speaker 4:          00:28:50       You're taking. Yeah. What I was gonna say though is that this oversensitivity is just a, it's just a side effect of this expanded understanding and in this expanded understanding now all of the different things that are injustices in the world of being highlighted in a way that never been highlighted before. So then people start going after them and then pushing the line further back and then they start looking for other slights that might be around, you know, other, uh, microaggressions, microaggressions, anything. What is this white people with dreadlocks. Justin Bieber adds fuel to the cultural appropriation debate. First of all, ladies and gentlemen, all you have to do is Google dreadlocks. That's what I did. And I found out that the fucking ancient Greeks were like the oldest people that wore greg dreadlocks like they, they believe it might have come from the ancient Greeks also, like a lot of other cultures work, dreadlocks, vikings, war, dreadlocks.

Speaker 4:          00:29:46       This, it's, it's, it's a cross the board with hair folks. Okay. This is not a black thing. Not only that, that's not what cultural appropriation is, kid. That's just style. What cultural appropriation is is like save these native Americans had a specific style of clothing that you. If you wore it, you were a woman and you were a sacred person or you had a head dress that you wore during very intense spiritual ceremonies and someone just started wearing that for fun. Someone thought it was cool to wear that for fun. Well then it becomes offensive and that's cultural appropriation because you this, these people have this ritual is very important. Sacred ritual in this one, part of that ritual, you are defacing your mocking it openly and it's offensive to them. It hurts them, and even that's arguable. That's cultural appropriation and I agree that there.

Speaker 4:          00:30:36       I think if someone has something that's sacred, like a head dress or something that they specifically were, and then you walk around and wear it, that's kind of a Dick move, right? If you have to earn that someone. Yeah. Yeah. It's like being a fake black belts or having a fake phd or pretending that you went to Vietnam and you didn't. There's a lot of those people out there, right? They're all equally offensive, but that's cultural appropriation is not a white guy were in dreadlocks. It's just not okay. That's a kid who likes to wear his hair like that. Who gives a fuck and the only reason why you give a fuck is because you've run out of things that are really important to care about in your life because if you cared about really important shit, you would concentrate on that. That is a massive distraction.

Speaker 4:          00:31:20       If a white kid with dreadlocks is gonna, you're going to go out of your way to find anger in a white kid with dreadlocks. All that says to me is you need more interests. That's for sure. You need more things that are interesting to you. Yeah. That's called work avoidance. You know, you're just focusing on the things that are of work avoidance. Right? You're right. Yeah, you're right. That is a great way of approaching it. It's exactly what it is and people do do that. Well, there's a class at leadership at the Kennedy school that I taught. It was taught by the only psychiatrist I'm on the faculty, Ron Heifetz, and that was a big concept was that, you know, as a leader, there's just so much work avoidance being done in different ways and how do you help people focus on the issues that are tearing them apart or that they're avoiding.

Speaker 4:          00:32:07       But it would be better if they try to work on it and you know, that word work is weird because work avoidance doesn't just mean like actual work, like working on your job. It could be working on yourself, you know, it could mean like there's a lot of people that get involved in wacky behavior because they also are addicted to cigarettes and maybe they drink too much so they start getting addicted to wacky behavior as well, not just as a side effect of the drugs, but also to distract them from dealing with the work they create. Dramas they treat bullshit and all, almost like to dis, just

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       to drown out the nagging poking of all the shit you actually need to get done. So then he just fucking tank your life again in this way. Tank your life again and that way. Yeah. My favorite approach to a work avoidance is doing lots and lots of other work other than what's the most important thing? Oh, really? Do put off everything except like what you really need to do. Um, I, I catch myself doing that now and then that's, that's crazy. Isn't it weird how your brain will just play little tricks on you like is that. I think it's this anxiety a bit about this is a big challenge and you don't know until you start how it's going to turn out and there's lots at stake and it's just, it's a matter of what you tolerate from yourself to. And that's a weird line in the sand that you gotta kind of learn to draw.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       If you want to actually get things done, you got to say, okay, now from, you know, 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, I do this, this is what I'm going to do. I want to sit down and we're going to work. And you beat the boss of yourself and then you sit down and you stare at the computer screen or stare at the notebook. And you do the writing that you were really trying to put off this hard for people to do though because a lot of times your brain is very wishy washy and we see for our choices, we receive our ability to open up our websites and just start going and what's going on and dig.com today. Oh Wow. That's crazy. And then next thing you know, it's 45 minutes after you were supposed to start. Yeah, I call it the tyranny of the empty page.

Speaker 1:          00:34:08       It's just so. But it's so nothing. Yeah. I sort of a weird thing to be terrified of what really put me at ease was one professor when I was working on my dissertation at the Kennedy School at Harvard and, and I just had this idea that you had to have it so good that you know, to be, were they and what I was doing, it just doesn't start that way. So I had three professors but he needed a fourth on my committee and he was the academic dean. He's terrific. But I said to him, you know, should I, um, because you're so busy, should I just worked through with the other professors and then just give it to you and the final phase just for you to read over. And he said, no, give it to me in the junk phase because that's when your comments are the most important.

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       But what it was got, he acknowledged that there was a junk phase and that helped me feel like, okay, I can start because I'm producing Janet, but it's, you know, you just keep trying to refine it or fight it. Oh, that's so important. I mean, should fear has this little piece of paper that he has glued or taped to his laptop and it says the first draft, first draft of everything is Shit. It's Ernest Hemingway and it's right underneath the screen. That's such a good point. You really have to go over things. Writing is weird. And whenever I read something that's like ponderous and just labored, I did this. You read this again, you got to read it after you write it, you got to write it, you've got to read it. And you've got to rewrite it and that's where, for me getting stone and editing stuff that I've written, it's harder sometimes I can write when I'm stoned, but it's very early and it sometimes will be like, um, you know, a half hour for a paragraph or so because I'm thinking about all the different words in ways and what you used to write with.

Speaker 1:          00:36:02       I'm to write with. Do you have like particular software? Do you write with? Do you have anything? I'm just Microsoft word. Do you ever try right room? Do you know what right room is? Um, no right room is this program where the entire screen goes black and I'll show it to the entire screen, goes black and all you get is these green letters and you can't access your browser. You can't, you can't do shit. This is what it looks like when I write. Oh Nice. So it's green letters there. You could see it up on the big screen as well. Um, so it's green letters, black background. And so when I write like that man, I feel like it just owns me in and just, I can't do anything else. I can't fuck off. I can't, you know, I just shut the Wifi off and Ram.

Speaker 1:          00:36:53       That's for me the best way, the best way to get into it, you know? Yeah. For me it usually takes a. I'm being like midnight or something like that. Have you ever seen scrivener? Scrivener? Is scribner's pretty cool too. It's something I've been using for years. It's this program that you can set it up. I think he set it up a bunch of different views, but the one I like, it looks like a cork board. So you have like index cards and you can write on index cards, see them up there like that. And there were all those index cards are expandable. So each one of those index cards can be, uh, an essay and you click on each one of them and then you get to notes and you, you can, you can open them up and read the full extent of it. You can highlight things and make notes on the highlights.

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       It's really cool program. I like it a lot. It's really cool too because I liked the, I like cork boards and I use them in real life and um, I like, I learned that from watching Sitcom writers. Do you can you have it where you've got like the different columns or different kinds of tasks and then you have them prioritized so you can kind of in one glance look at. I don't know, you'd have to explore that. Only use it for notes, but I'm sure I'm sure it's pretty flexible, but I think it's mostly a wow who, who started using it. I think it was a screenwriting tool initially I think it was, but a lot of people use it because it's just a, it's really cool of you. What kind of stuff are you writing? So mostly just bullshit. Just my thoughts on things then extract, stand up out of it, you know, I'll just, I'll, I'll write like long form things.

Speaker 1:          00:38:31       I keep saying that I'm going to get back to writing a blog, but I just never, I never have the real itch to just tee. I like, I like, like these half process things that then become bits, you know, almost like use it as a farm I guess. Like I used to try to like write a joke or he used to try to write like beginning punchline setup, but then I realized like the best way for me at least with my styles to write a bunch of shit and then find out what's funny about it, you know, is tweeting sorted for you like notes or blog something useful? Sometimes it is, yeah. Sometimes it's cool. I like tweet. I like texting, tweeting rather because you only get 140 text characters. Those 140 characters. I think that's good because it makes you economize and it makes you edit and then it makes you, it makes you a better joke writer and a lot of ways like the actual, like um, the figuring out the slams and the punches in a joke.

Speaker 1:          00:39:29       I think you can get to them better when you learn how to say funny shit on twitter because you only have 140 characters that small amount of text in this little box. And you've got to figure out a way to get your point across and hopefully be funny too, you know, sometimes it's just stupid texts to me. Like someone will say something really stupid, just so silly and I just can't stop laughing. Like I think, uh, it's, it's interesting like how tweets have like a time where they work to, you know, like something could have just happened the news and then some will have the perfectly time ridiculous tweet and like in that moment, like that dude like cracked up the whole Party of, of the world, you know, or that woman or whoever the hell said it is a lot of people that like a Jenny Johnson who was in here, she's become famous and a working comic from tweets just from being funny on twitter.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       Wow. You know, it's amazing. Yeah, it's crazy. I haven't really used that. Well you guys use maps using. Oh, we have tremendous. Excellent. You guys are really on the ball to when it comes to social media and getting people engaged and retweeting your stuff. Rice, milk. I'm Marie is in charge of that and he does great. We have such a seem yes, right? I know you guys are amazing. It's so, like I said, it's so important to balance out people like meat. You want balance out like me, you know what we're in the stage of the, um, what I'm considering our major reality check of our 30 years of existence and that's submitting the data from Mtma assisted psychotherapy for ptsd. These phase two studies that we've been working on for the last 15 years and submitting that to first off to our FDA consultants and then to Fda about going to the next step about going from exploratory studies to studies that if they work then you get approval as a prescription medicine as a prescription

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       treatment. So we're, we're bringing all of these data points that we've gotten roughly just in this bunch of studies, around $7,000,000 studies over a 105 people. And what we're able to tell is a story about risk and a story about benefit for posttraumatic stress disorder from any cause with Mtma assisted psychotherapy as compared to a placebo and also from the literature and working with people who have failed other medications. It's a weird subjective subject, isn't it? Like how people feel. How do you feel about, you know, your life because it's, it's assisted psychotherapy, like how much of an impact you specifically can you attribute to the drug, right? The, um, the test will actually determine that because one group of people will get the therapy with a placebo. I mean this is how we're thinking of for phase three and this is how some of the studies we did with phase two.

Speaker 3:          00:42:41       So I think being rigorous and skeptical is really important. Super important. So the first point is if you can do this with the therapy without the drug, then why do you need the drug? But there's so many variables when it comes to therapy as well, right? Like the relationship between the therapist and the patient. Yeah. There's so many variables and ranges of individual responses. So there's these massive tables, statistical tables for sample size calculations that help you figure out on the basis of all these assumptions, how many people you need in this study to get statistically significant results. And how many do you need? Well, we're still working through the different assumptions. I would say I'm an alien. Let's get a million people highs.

Speaker 3:          00:43:29       Well, just think of the cost though. That's your problem. It's got to be some billionaire character out there. Smart. Once they're like Richard Branson, Richard Branson started stitching out them Dma, then we've got a party there. There are, um, support that we're, we're getting. That makes me very hopeful about our ability to raise the money for phase three. We think it's going to cost around 24 or $5. Million Dollars. Wow. And we have about half of it already. Wow. Either enhanced or committed a serious shit. Yeah. Well, the consequences if it works is that then we can start setting up psychedelic psychotherapy clinics for Mtma for ptsd. We can start negotiating with the va and the Department of Defense with their hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Speaker 3:          00:44:18       The enormous, um, last year was about $6,000,000,000 that the va spent in disability payments for about 600,000 veterans that are disabled to some degree with ptsd just for Ptsd, just for bdsd around $6,000,000,000 every year. Why? Just in disability payments for, that's why the human sufferings who the money. Oh my God. Because the. It's hard when people are traumatized. I would've never guessed it was that high $6,000,000,000 just for ptsd. I would have thought just for disability payments. That's, that's not cost. One other thing. And that's a lot of. And what we're able to, what we've been able to show what we say in this group of a hundred and five people is that, and this is ptsd from any cause, not just war, but um, childhood sexual abuse or rape or workplace accident trauma of any kind that a substantial percentage of these people can have significant improvement.

Speaker 3:          00:45:28       And how that's valuated is. Fortunately for us, there is a independent rater administered scale for not for symptoms of ptsd and it's called the cap. So the clinician administered PTSD scale. It's the gold standard developed by the Va, used by the FDA to approve Zoloft and Paxil for ptsd and it's just been revised from caps for to campus five, so it's a work in progress over decades and so this. This is the objective scale and people do have to tell their story to an independent rater and the way that the independent rating system is going to be done is going to be a whole pool of them that are calibrated with each other. Interrater reliability and they know how to administer this and they were randomly assigned to what we think will be about 230 people for one phase three study. That's probably what we're going to be proposing and we need to have those studies to large scale phase three studies and what we're going to have is these raiders will be randomly assigned to one of the subjects and they won't necessarily know is this the one year follow up the two month follow up.

Speaker 3:          00:46:48       That really is the primary outcome measure or the baseline. So the independent raters are really important because for skeptical people in science, the double blind is a key development. How you do an experiment, you shouldn't know the two conditions she shouldn't know which is the experimental one in which isn't because your biases might make you suddenly see what you want to see. Right. And it's very hard not to do that. That's kind of a human tendency. So the idea has been these placebo controlled double blind studies, but it's good in theory, but with a psychedelic use, people tell if they've got a placebo that does nothing or a psychedelic drug. It's a fundamental problem of this research and that's why these independent raters are even more important for people to have confidence in the results. And what we've tried is a series of studies giving low dose Mtma and comparing it to medium and full dose.

Speaker 3:          00:47:54       And so the idea we thought was that if people are confused about which dose they're getting, but then we can show a dose response relationship, then that's the double blind. That's the solution to the double blind problem is that everybody knows they're getting Mtma, but they don't know what dose they're getting and so you have to show the people to get the higher dose, do better than the people that get the lower dose and the people patients might not know. Therapists could be confused that that's the ideal. So that's, that's what we're heading for and that's what we've spent the last 10 years or so researching with different low doses of Mtma, 25 milligrams, 30 milligrams, 40 milligrams, 75 milligrams, 101 slash 25 and we would always have this possibility of half the initial dose administered one and a half to two and a half hours later to prolong the experience and make it an eight hour therapy session.

Speaker 3:          00:48:55       So when these people were getting this a sec, they're getting it or Mtma they're getting it in a clinical setting. Yeah, they're getting it in a clinical setting. How often a w s three times three to five weeks apart in case. So that's. And it's a three and a half month therapy process of weekly psychotherapy. So the emphasis is on the psychotherapy, the preparation, the therapeutic alliance, and then after three weeks there's the initial MTMA session and it takes place in a special treatment center treatment room where there's a male, female co therapist team with the person, the person, the patient is having their blood pressure monitored, they're having their temperature monitored, they're being videotaped, the whole thing. And there's video tapes on the therapist as well. We're trying to understand about the method and the experiment. This portion of it, the session is about eight hours treasonous.

Speaker 3:          00:49:57       Who's auditing all this footage? We are, we've loading it up or we don't. Um, we're, we're, we're not having somebody audit all of it. We have the therapists. I'm sort of note which are the decisive moments. So I stuff on youtube, we're developing. This is. Yeah. Actually. So in order to train therapists, the best way to train therapists is to show here's videotapes of actual patients under MTMA. And this is how they're, it's poetry, it's, it's Po, it's symbolic poetry. People talk in terms of imagery because half the time their eyes are closed. I'm listening to music having just their own private experience, the other half of the time and more or less they're communicating with the therapists and it varies and there's no particular order of things. So it's basically, and this is what I felt with the native Americans with the, when we did Mtma with the pod circle, that they had these elaborate rituals that, you know, we went through the whole night that were beautiful and filled with these rich symbols.

Speaker 3:          00:51:04       Um, but then they went, so they did some of their opening prayers and they want to know what we're going to do and we didn't have anything. He was like, well, we just sit around and somebody says it's kind of a more free form. It felt that we had like a poverty of ritual, but also freedom to, to explore like that. And that's what we try to provide in this mtma experience that people have their unconscious as the guide. And we're not the guide. We're not steering them anywhere. There's all these techniques. We know we're not a, we're responding to this emergence of material that's been catalyzed by the relationship, the setting. And then the drug and we're supporting this emergence and different people will sometimes go to the trauma first or not talk about it till the fifth hour or they'll go to childhood experiences that were supportive to build strength or they'll be, but often it's in the symbolic language and they're sort of telling themselves a story.

Speaker 3:          00:52:12       Wow. And that story can reorder the neural networks and their brain and deemphasize activity in certain fear centers of the Medola and can change how memories are stored. We're just sending Mtma to Rockefeller University where one of the leading scientists and anxiety is going to start some studies when animals, mice, rats, I'm not sure which, um, and trying to look at fear extinction and memory reconsolidation and how mtma effects that. Whoa. Yeah. So we're starting to get, I fear extinction, but through giving someone mdm may at least lessons anxiety. Yeah. So it, it means that when you have memory, you react with fear all the time. That's. And this, this fear has never fully been processed. It's always like, it's about happening. It's not been fully processed because it's been so scary. Right? More emotionally rich. Jay, so with the Mtma you can help people through this way of reducing the fear response, their activity and they mingle is reduced. Wow. And so people can

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       have the content without the fearful emotion. So as some sort of a bridge or a blocker, a yes. Yeah, but it changes the structure of a memory to that person because it changes how the. Ma'Am, every time you have a memory you have to consolidate from different parts of your brain. Then you reconsolidate the memory. Yeah. That's why people have weird false memories, right? Yeah. They would swear were real. Yeah. Yeah. Your memories change over time, but it's a memory of a memory that you're retelling. It's almost like you're like, if someone you know that had a story and they did something and they told it to you and then you tell your friends about that story, that how, Hey, I know Bob's story. Let me tell you Bob Story, but you don't really know Bob's story because you only know it from him. Yeah. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:54:12       Like you weren't there when it happened and I think that's some of what happens with Lee's, my memories as they get older and older. I'm like, what is this? This is a memory of a memory that I had. Yeah. You have to double check. Yeah, a lot. And what happens is that people's memory for the trauma actually gets better with Mtma. You can somehow another change what that memory is. No, you know, that's the beauty part of it. Do you change your reaction to them? But I mean with that is to you like the feeling tone. Yeah. So, so because these memories were so scary, they've been suppressed but, but not successfully. They're not fully integrated. Still activating fury actions on frequently and so when you can feel peaceful and then bringing up the memories and then because you're feeling peaceful, people remember even better. You know what you guys should really do. If you really want to prove the effect of city of effectiveness of Mtma, you should go to Worldstar hip hop.com and find all those people that got fucked up and give them ecstasy and see if it helps. Because there's so many people that got punted in the head and thrown off a fucking building.

Speaker 1:          00:55:31       We have the Zendo project. Is that for Worldstar hip hop.com exclusively for electronic dance music festivals and burning man. I'm done. Definitely different. Definitely different. Yeah. But I mean the idea of being able to better process trauma is universally appealing. I think all of us have had bad moments in our life that probably overcome. And you, you know, you probably have some character because of those moments, but it would be nice if you had a full handle on how it makes you feel. Yeah. Yeah. And, and that's where this memory enhancement comes in handy because then you can really learn from what happened. Can I ask you how you chose Mtma out of all the different psychoactive substances? Yes. Um, I felt that MTMA had a chance of being

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       welcomed into the culture as the first of the different psychedelics because it has that fear reducing. It's not so psychedelic. It's not a classic psychedelics. Yeah. It, it doesn't make you feel like you're losing control. It makes it so that you feel a subtle shift of openness to self acceptance and self love and self acceptance I think is like the core of it, and your muscles relax. People can stretch a couple inches more really when are more limber on Mtma. No kidding. Yeah, yeah. Have you, have they ever done that with athletes? Um, I don't know. They should do it with athletes like people that are already really flexible, like maybe jazz or something like, and that's the Yoga people and I've done martial arts people. Yeah, you can do. I think that's part of the muscles relax and that part of your attention is, or it's tense because of parts of your brain and so that the way in which you can then have this full memory when you're feeling peaceful and you're looking at it as if it's happened in the past, which it did.

Speaker 3:          00:57:37       So you finally got this perspective on it because this piece makes it so that you're. You're not seeing it as happening right now because you realize it's not happening right now. It happened then. And so you're creating this longer, different kinds of memory storage of something that was clearly in the past and it's connected now to this reflective, peaceful tone. So when the memory has reconsolidated restored, the next time you call it, you'd get the incident, but you get the emotional tone of this peacefulness and that it's in the past. And so you can do work within a period of minutes, sometimes hours of seeing a shift, um, and looking at something differently and processing these traumatic memories. It's rare, but one person was in our study and he dropped out after just one session because like I got this is like part of what he got.

Speaker 3:          00:58:39       Tony macy is his name, was one of the vets. And part of what he got was that he had been telling himself that he was on opiates for pain, for injuries, but that he was starting to realize it was really more of a escapism and that he didn't need them and he didn't need drugs and he didn't need Mtma or wow. He didn't need anymore. And he, he'd had what he needed and will. Kudos. Yeah. And we asked them later if, um, if, if he would at least be part of our followup evaluations, and he said yes to that, well, that's nice of him. And so he didn't have a, it wouldn't qualify ptsd at

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       the two month. And then when it got closer to like the one year, which is our last follow up, he started saying, well, you know, I'm still feeling pretty okay, but I think I could learn more from md, may, maybe can I have now some more of these sessions. And we said, well, it's a rigid protocol you've dropped out. Um, but let's just wait and see if you even would qualify to be in the study if you even have ptsd. So we did the 12 month followup and he didn't have, he wouldn't even qualify to be and still wanted to give some exit off you because there's other things to learn how good it feels to me. Trying to party party under the auspice of scientific study. And, and in order to be the most rigorous too, there's a way to look at studies. One is called the per protocol.

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       Everybody that finishes the study and meets the criteria and the other is called intent to treat, so that means everybody that comes, you got to look at their data. Even if they drop out or they lied to get into the study or they wouldn't have qualified or whatever it is. Once you have enrolled somebody that's the more conservative, you just have to include everybody. You can't just be picking the people that fulfilled your treatment plan. Right? So this guy was a part of that. We couldn't normally count them, but now that we're doing the most conservative intent to treat analysis, we can include the dropouts. So actually Tony Scores of massive reduction in ptsd symptoms after just one session counts in our data. Wow. Because he was screened and had the first session. There's so many variabilities, happiness being such a crazy sort of unquantifiable thing, right?

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       That's what everybody wants. Everybody wants some happiness and one of the things that Mtma does seem to provide a lot of people is relief from tension, which in a lot of ways equals happiness. I mean, if, if, if you know universally, if you had to say what is the one thing that people get from a drug called ecstasy, it's you feel great, right? You feel relief, you feel comfortable, insecurities melt. They just dissolve. They don't, they don't exist anymore and you can approach people in this really weird open way where you're not constantly ready to judo, whatever kind of bad shit they're sending your way, like so many people when they communicate, they always have some sort of a wall up or some sort of a barrier between their real feelings and what they're projecting so that they can sort of figure out how to navigate this conversation with the least amount of social damage. You know? I mean it's like this is like a zen to some styles of communication like this way of going through it with having the least amount of conflict in your life. But if everybody was on ecstasy, that would be the vibe like this. There's a vibe that you get and I'm not saying everybody should do it or what I'm saying is, is a vibe that you get when you communicating? I accidentally, it makes it almost impossible to

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       have arguments with people. It gets weird like you communicate with people in this open way that you will never even attempt if he weren't both on Mtma yeah, we actually have a study starting in the next month or so where we're going to give to people Mtma at the same time to a couple a dialogue of, well these are already people that are related, but one of them has ptsd and one of them it affects the relationship but doesn't have ptsd. And so this was, um, a major, major breakthrough because I'm, the first study with psychedelics was in the modern era was 1990 with Rick strassman with a dmt study. Uh, and ever since then, now for the past 26 years, it's only been one person getting Mtma or psilocybin or Lsd or anything at a time. So this is the first time we've been able to work with two people at a time and give them Mtma.

Speaker 3:          01:03:17       And it's also the study that's in informal collaboration with the Veterans Administration, National Center for Ptsd. It's a therapist that used to work within the national center who's now at Ryerson University in Toronto, who develop this approach and who was introduced to us through the work of Richard Rockefeller who was opening the doors for us with the National Center for Ptsd and we met this woman, candice Monson, who's the researcher, and she's developed what's called cognitive behavioral conjoint therapy and conjoint means couples and so it's a cognitive behavioral sort of scripted how you kind of think about your trauma and exercises about it, but it's for couples and so when they were thinking how to blend Mtma with traditional non drug psychotherapies that are used by the va, the couple's therapy they thought would be the most logical because it helps you to have those kinds of communications. You're the better listeners. You're more empathic. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:04:19       You can get over stuck arguments and the ptsd really does affect the relationship and in a lot of ways and there's. The researchers have all these measures of the relationship with the style of communication between the people. We really care about the caps, the clinician administered ptsd scale, but it's going to be tremendously exciting and we've been able to get permission for the first time to give to people MTMA and we'll be able to monitor that, but couples therapy, even though it's a tremendous use of Mgma, will never make it through the FDA because you can only take diseases. You don't have to treat a disease. It's not for personal psychotherapy, which is not, you know those things. It could be anxiety disorder or ptsd or depression. We have to treat diseases. It's such a weird distinction there. If there's something wrong and you have a substance that makes that wrong, better, why? Why does it have something wrong? Have

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       to be something you look at in a petri dish. Well, only because of the drug war. It's only because it's illegal. Otherwise it doesn't make any sense. I mean, it's obviously there's a condition and a solution to that condition mean this is the fact that you're not dying from feeling like shit about your marriage. It doesn't mean there's not a problem. You know? I mean, that's so stupid. Yeah, it will be one of the best uses of Mtma. I mean that's like making toothpaste illegal. It's like, you know, the, unless you have like a serious dental disorder and you really need to clean the holes, like you have some sort of a horrible root canal that's about to happen. It's the idea that you can somehow or another key people from doing what they wanna do. That's at the heart of it all right.

Speaker 3:          01:06:04       Right. And, and I think that the, this idea of, again, the psychedelics because Hashtag psychedelics because of coming out of the closet of people saying that that this has been helpful and that this is something good and we should be able to do this. And um, I think the eventual use, we're sort of backing into this use in couples, but it's really about making empty manger medicine for Ptsd and it's also about trying to understand what's the drug and what's the, the context. So while we had this context I was describing of this non directive therapy of the unconscious being the guide, other people like cognitive behavioral, they give you all these exercises to think about. And how you think about your trauma and we're and when it, your triggers are and all different kinds of thought exercises. And so we're seeing that MTMA is like a general tool and so we're, because it's nonprofit drug development, we're trying to work with as many other therapists was, as many other, uh, combinations of treatments that they want to use to explore if they want to blend Mtma with it. And so we have this 960 grams of

Speaker 1:          01:07:22       worlds. Some of the world's purest am. Don't tell me where it is made by Dave Nichols at. Don't even give up the dude's name. They're going to hold them hostage and make them. Now this was a, a lady had legal permission, legal MDM. This is all legal. What I'm saying, 1985. I had a kilogram made. Oh my God. And that's what does that two pounds. I'm two point two pounds. Two pounds. Jesus Christ. Yeah. And googling Mowgli young Jamie. And this. This was in the department of Medicinal chemistry at purdue. Oh my God. They got a better yield than they thought. They got more than a killer doll. Yeah, but they did, they started off with it and the whole night I only paid $4,000 for it. Did you guys ever do a rave while you're making it? Absolutely not. Oh, I'll read that you at all. But way to go.

Speaker 1:          01:08:17       We just stick to the script. Yeah, no, that was, this was, you know, there's like the legal track and understand. Yeah. That's why the yield was totally off. No, it was all right. So we have a 960 grams left 31 years later. It's Christ and it's still the exact same thing we're using in our study. So 31 years later it's the, you know, it's kept in a room temperature and without light, without moisture. It's just infuriating that it's taken this long for people to recognize what other people have said for the other people said for a long time. And I understand the idea of having rigorous scientific testing, but at a certain point in time it should be, there should be enough anecdotal evidence and lack of, for me, I mean, how many people died from Mgma? Has Anybody? Um, yes. Yeah. What are the risks?

Speaker 1:          01:09:07       What is the ld 50? Yeah, well, I'm ld 50 is a measure where you give a bunch of animals increasing amounts and the amount where you kill half of them, right? Um, the ld 50 of 'em empty main humans. Um, I don't actually even know that number. Um, but it has happened. People have people they died from it or they die for. I know people have died from dehydration have died from hyperthermia. Right? So mtma affects your temperature controls, which is one reason we measure temperature, although in therapy, but in a clinical setting, line down, there's no problem with temperature at all. Um, and normally there wouldn't be either. If there was adequate harm reduction and people were drinking, not just water, but I'm electrolytes. Um, and they would take time. People are always so sweaty is I was going on there sweating, but the dance a lot too.

Speaker 1:          01:10:09       It's that combination. So some people have maybe glowsticks, pacifier, glitter, glitter. I know my analogy about toothpaste is a bad one, know toothpaste and teeth, but there is, there is some weirdness to this idea that we need a substance like gets classified whether no matter whether it's legal or illegal, it's gets classified and when you make something a drug and that drug can only be used when there's an ailment, then you lock out the whole possibility of performance enhancing substances like, well we can't. I mean we, we don't disclude across the board performing, enhancing, enhancing substances. I mean that's essentially what coffee is and it's mandatory. I mean, coffee breaks or written into union bills. I mean all the, like when they make a contract, they've write in coffee breaks. We've always had coffee breaks, right? That's a break to take a drug for productivity.

Speaker 1:          01:11:04       And it used to be illegal at one point where people gathered together and talk and revolution in England. Incredible. So it's like many other things. So we, this one, performance enhancing drug will ecstasy is probably a performance enhancing drug as well because it gets rid of some of the bullshit that you've got clogging up your thinking. Right? And it allows you to think more freely. Right? And you can. It's, it's, it's the most inherently therapeutic of all the psychedelics. So when you asked me why did I choose Mtma, I think one part is it is the most inherently therapeutic. People tend not to have bad trips. That kind of bad trips people have is when they take Mtma in a recreational setting and difficult emotions come up and there with friends that just want to party and they tried to stuff the emotions down and someone plays slayer and real loud or that would be worse too.

Speaker 1:          01:11:54       And then they end up worse off. So MTMA can make people worse off toe. Well there's certain people that really shouldn't be allowed to chew gum and we should take them into account too. There's certain people that are going to stub their toe every time they walk. And I don't think we should know if the world okay. It's super important to recognize when you're looking at all these numbers and statistics that there is a certain percentage of these people in this world that are helpless. You just can't do anything about them. There is everything, if you look at, I'm skiing, look at the number of people that die running into trees. I mean, every year there's about 35 or 40 people that die skiing. Every year. Two, we lost Sonny Bono. You'd have to remind me. Yeah, I have to bring it up, throw salt. And that's not even counting people with avalanches.

Speaker 1:          01:12:39       But, but that's because there are benefits and that's where again, this coming out, it's fun schemes. Fun but the, you know, so it was driving race cars. That's fun too. If there's a lot of stuff that's fun but dangerous. Look, there's a lot of dangerous activities, but the amount of people that actually die from ecstasy versus skiing, very low and very. A lot of people take who skis ski more, take ecstasy more. Um, I think that a lot of what people think is ecstasy is exiting. Meaning Mtma is really something else. So that's another problem is right around the half of it. I'm like math, right? With erowid.org, there's an ecstasy pill testing program that they have been conducting that we helped start years ago. People, there's one licensed laboratory licensed by the dea and the United States that can take anonymous samples of drugs. You can get drugs tested, and so there's been this program to get ecstasy.

Speaker 1:          01:13:34       Pills tested over eight or $900 have already been tested and around half of them don't even have mtma in them. Jesus Christ. So there's they mostly amphetamines. They're fed means their caffeine. A lot of pain pills. Yeah. They're selling them as excess. Sometimes they would, um, there there's test kits that dance safe cells and sometimes, um, to pool the test kits which turns a certain color if there's Mtma in it. There's been pills that are one part mtma nine parts. Caffeine. Wow. Because there is the stimulant aspect and people stay up. It's a terrible up, but the risks of Mtma

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       even in a large recreational setting, if, if it were a post prohibition world, those risks would be very manageable. But there would be some people, probably a rare situations, somebody might die. We have that all the time with cars, with alcohol, with, you know, I can't say that it would never happen. It's like those freaks that are allergic to shrimp, right? Or Venice Hillen people die for. Yeah. This is going to be risk for everything. There's nothing that's safe. 100 percent. Even salt. Salt kills people who die from salt over doses every year. Right? Aspirin. Aspirin kills people. Yeah. Some thousands of people die every year. But the actual. Yeah, it's, yeah, it's crazy. The number of people that fall in their bathtub and day and to foods get rid of bathtubs to make them all out of rubber. And so one of the things that, um, my wife said about me when, uh, some of the neighborhood teenagers when we had our teenagers were thinking of coming to visit me at boom festival in Europe, which is one of these festivals where they have the most harm reduction.

Speaker 3:          01:15:21       Um, and these were teenage boys. And what my wife said about me was that I wasn't really good at prevention, but I was good at rescue. Mm. And so that's for me, the prohibition versus public health, you know, prevention, public, you know, prohibition. But if we can be good at acknowledging the risks, but being prepared for them the same way that festivals have medical tents and people have all sorts of physical problems, but the problem is there's not a strict prohibition on dangerous things. So the precedents already been set of a freedom. That precedent of freedom. We would like to extend across the board. We. That's what we want. We don't. You can't tell me that I can go to a bar and drink my fucking lungs out and smoke cigarettes all day long and I can take pain pills and I can do all these things, but I can't have a joint.

Speaker 3:          01:16:08       You can't. You can't tell me that. It doesn't make any sense. Did you see the quote that was recently circulated on the Internet by Erlick men about the origins of the drug war? I did see that repeated well what basically he said that Nixon, when they were looking at the protests that were being conducted by the hippies against the war, against a lot of Nixon policies and the blacks who are arguing for civil rights, that they knew they could not make it illegal to be black or illegal to be a Hippie, but they could look at the drugs that those groups were using and selectively criminalized and prosecute them and use them to break up those communities and that they knew they were exaggerating the science and that the drug war was a political war against certain kinds of drug users who were considered to be a problem to Nixon and Ehrlichman and this was something that they will come and said, I'm 20 years ago. It didn't get that much attention and he's been dead I think 10 years now, but it just came out again in an article and people are looking at what Ehrlichman said and it seems intuitively true. Intuitively true in just unbelievable how damaging

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       and for how long. I mean, it's been going on since 1970, so we're, we're deep here. Yeah, but it also had triggered into a fear of the unconscious of fear, the drugs, not just these political parts, but just the drugs themselves and the reasons why they were political with also the blanket label of drugs becomes really problematic because you have all these things lumped in together. You've got heroin and marijuana in the same categories. You've got cocaine and all these things that are so different and to call them all drugs, it, it, it's, it's, it's not a good implication. It doesn't make sense. It's not a good distinction. Like there should be obvious classifications like we all know, like I say, you, you asked me about, uh, you were telling me about the ecstasy and I immediately thought amphetamines. Well that's a category and that's how we should describe them.

Speaker 1:          01:18:01       I don't think describing things, oh, you do drugs, you know, like this. That's a dumb. Well, yeah, of course I do. What am I stupid. They figured out how to do things that are way better than not having them. And there's plenty of drugs that are excellent, like the idea that you're going to be completely drug free is dumb. Our brains are a drug factory. Yeah. I don't do damaging drugs. Don't do terrible drugs, don't do meth, don't do things that are going to fuck you up. Yeah. Don't do the. Yeah, there's probably some stuff you should avoid just because it's not healthy for you. But the problem is labeling them all drugs. It depends on the dose. It depends on the context. So that one of the, the FDA made their reputation in the early sixties on blocking thalidomide to be prescribed in America for morning sickness for pregnant women because it caused all these solidimide babies.

Speaker 1:          01:18:50       Um, and it was, I'm skeptical woman who ended up winning the president's Medal of honor, the only person from the FDA for blocking this drug to linemite. It was the epitome of the bad drug. But now it's used in the treatment of cancer. It's an approved medication. Thalidomide is an approved. Let medications. They just one of those medications that only affects a certain pages, certain blood vessels. And it can be useful in certain ways are terrible. So it, you know, it's not that there's good and bad drugs, it's not that things are good or bad in themselves. Like I don't think methamphetamine is a bad, you know, there's mass for that. Do you ever do it? I've tried it. What's it like? Um, I like tried it one time. You cleaned your house, should have that kind of energetic. Um, you know, it wasn't that it was similar to cocaine. Um, it was a stimulant that can be really useful. My father, this was a shocking thing. My father was a doctor, a pediatrician and years ago, and he's retired now, but he, he, well after I was into doing psychedelics

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       and it dropped out with, this was what I was focusing on. He shared with me that he and his, uh, medical friends did math because they were under these ridiculous residencies and they had to work for these really long hours. Wow. And that in the fifties it was very common for residents, medical doctors with all sorts of people, zoo, methamphetamine to, and, and it's, it was a major tool used in the war and with the soldiers and it's um, you know, it doesn't have this, um, brain, it doesn't have this evolutionary feel in a way. It helps you do, you're doing, but there's a way where psychedelics help you refine what you're doing. And so it just gives you energy. Does it give you food? There's a mood to. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's. So mtma is methylenedioxy methamphetamine, so there is a similar molecular change with other additions to it, which fundamentally changed how it happens, what it does in the brain. So that's a part of maybe what triggers the euphoria as well as the dopamine release. Yeah. That is so that, that chemically, that the army in 1952, the chemical warfare and people, they were looking for mind control drugs. And so they did a study with animal toxicity studies looking for ld [inaudible] and others with eight different drugs in a range. One of them was Mtma and one was, it was like meth amphetamine to masculine.

Speaker 3:          01:21:38       So mtma is kind of like I'm masculine in a sense that it has that which is from pod, which has this psychedelic, um, ego dissolving and things emerging and nonverbal processing and emotional intensity that it has that from masculine, but it's not that eco desolving it's more you're calmer and that has the energy from methamphetamine but not in a jittery way because you can sit still, you can meditate, meditators are now, you know, some of them have learned from Mtma or Psilocybin to tip in a meditative practice. So you can use these in any number of, of different ways. And so you kind of have this paradoxical combination of methamphetamine and masculine that produced the molecule. It does something different but reminiscent. And it is something that I believe that will be used in initially highly controlled therapeutic settings for particular clinical indications. And over time, and by overtime, I mean I'm 10 or 20 years, there would be a, uh, a development of psychedelic clinics like hospice centers.

Speaker 3:          01:22:58       Hospice centers spread all over America in 30 years. The first one was 1974, 2004. There was 3,500, so a place to help people who are at the end of life, so these are psychedelic treatment centers to help people do ego death or to to tie to their old selves or to see more or that these centers will be developed all over America. I think over a process of once the drugs are approved and probably Mtma and silicide and we'll both be approved around the same time. I'm one of the other, you know, in 20, 21 is our current predictions and then we'll start elaborating these clinics and then people will get more and more comfortable to it so that a medicalization proceeds legalization and that's what we've seen with medical marijuana that the culture gets comfortable through this process of I'm now research and use that they can trust that they see directly and they see distribution centers that aren't violent and people see a system and they then are now.

Speaker 3:          01:24:03       Now it's. The latest poll was 60 percent of Americans in favor Americans in favor of marijuana legalization. Wow. Highest it's ever been. That's incredible. Yeah, so that, I think that it's, I think that we need, people are under so much stress and if you look around at the world, the world is under so much stress and the environment is under stress and the cultures are bumping up against each other, that we need to have all the tools available to manage the stress because it's a, it's a tremendously crucial time in human history where we have these capabilities through our technology that we never have for impact. Planetary Systems went away. These psychedelic drugs that are kind of technology as well. There are technology to get us to understand how our brains functioning. Yes. And there's, there's this, um, a confluence of coincidence, of timing that the, um, Albert Hoffman who invented lsd first upgraded and 38 and then accidentally ingested it in 43, felt that the development of nuclear splitting of the atom was occurring contemporaneously with this discovery of LSD.

Speaker 3:          01:25:16       And, and in his view, there was this kind of outer technology and this inner technology. And that Einstein said the splitting of the atom has changed everything except our motive thinking. And hence we drift towards unparalleled could astrophe what shall be required as a substantially new mode of thinking. And Albert Hoffman was like, well, I do wonder about the, um, the technology, which many people think that if it comes from nature, it's really good. You know, they're there if it's plant medicine, but if it comes from a lab at somehow suspect. But I think that it comes from our mind. We're from nature labs, so lsd nature of these plants, they just extract the chemicals from these plants. When you break it down to what the chemicals are, you can reproduce those in the lab. It's not as, as. It's not

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       natural. It's exactly the same thing as natural. It's all natural, right? Because it's all from something that's on earth. Well actually, because we're trying to see, you know, how we're operating in the public benefit manner and fair trade and all this. I asked the company that's now making us are a kilogram of. We're having a new kilogram of Mtma made and if you need more. I thought you said you had a gang of it. We have 960 grams, but it's, it's not gmp medical. It's not acceptable for phase three research. Oh yeah. I would say that. Something like that. So I would say went bad. We got to keep it away. The kids. Well we do. We want to give it away to researchers. So if there are researchers that are listening, we have free time researching. We would search for you too. We would like to give it there, but the uh, mostly crocodile attacks.

Speaker 1:          01:26:56       But I'll fuck around with some ideas about the current. Alaina is costing us, um, to have the medical grade is now costing us $400,000. Zero. Of course we need that. We need that medical grade and that's what our event. You got to like a bucket of this stuff laying around. Well, but it's not, you know, that's where we're making this transition. Yes. Into the higher regulated areas. So it is just that the standards of procurement weren't as strict. Is that? Yes. That the, that the symphony may just as pure as the, what we're going to get, by the way, never used the word procurement. One of those words that are used in the smoothness of the right word is that okay could use right there. It's the pedigree of all the ingredients, so there has to be a paper trail for the ingredients and so you don't have that right now.

Speaker 1:          01:27:45       You've got your shift from a dealer. We sort of. One of the things that he didn't have all of the paperwork. Oh, it's like a car. Apparently there's a part of the process of making mtma where you need aluminum and took some aluminum. Jesus Christ with Rowan forks in there and he took some aluminum foil and use that in the process. Oh, that's bad. Well, because it's not like witchy aluminum foil and which batch and where did it come from? And Jesus Christ. This guy through aluminum foil into your fucking mixture. Janky ass fucking way to make things. Throw the metal in. It seems so stupid. I'm sure it was a really bad cans. Fuck yeah, dude. I'm in it. Want to roll? We're rolling. Yeah. If I knew more chemistry, I could kind of explain what it did and in the process. But aluminum is super calm, a common rather aluminum is like a, we think of aluminum as being frying pans, but that's not the, that's not the form it takes in the wild, you know, we're car panels and make a lot of cars out of aluminum now because they figured out how to make like super lightweight but very strong aluminum.

Speaker 1:          01:28:54       That's as strong as steel but lighter. But aluminum is everywhere. It's in dirt. Like it's like one of the most common metals. So they use this stuff. How much do you need? Like in say a tiny amount? I don't think it was all that much. I was. What does it do? I, I don't. I'm not a chemist so I can't really say. He didn't get curious. Have you found other shit you were taking? I was just like, wow, this is a peer Mtma great dude. I would've been like, hold the fuck up. I'm just saying you threw a fork in there to sit down and you gotta tell me what are you doing? What are you doing? Why does it have to have aluminum foil? We went to the FDA and we said, is there some way we can take this Mtma, which is just as pure as what we're going to get and turn it into medical grade, and they said there's no way you can really do that because you have to.

Speaker 1:          01:29:43       This is now preparing for prescription Mtma, so I understand. All right, so I have to take it from every initial ingredient has to be verified at the source, weighed out, documented, and then you make it and then it's medical grade. Well, is that right? More or less so. Of this 400,000. We're about $75,000 is just to validate all the methods that are being used. Another 54,000 is three years. Stability Studies to show that the MTMA can last three years. Even though we have mtma from 1985, we're still using this that we have stability, purity studies on throughout the years, but it's about this particular batch and actually our 30th anniversary celebration on April 17th in Oakland at the Scottish rite center. It's just a plug for a party. This is a plug for a party. There you just snuck that in is for raising money to illegal drug deal to buy this Mtma.

Speaker 1:          01:30:38       How do people find out about this? And they didn't get there. Go to the maps, that org website and there's information right on the homepage. Powerful. Thank you. And it's about helping people though also think about having dinners in their own homes with their friends. So are you going to make a holiday dude? Why not? Man? Columbus has a fucking holiday and he's widely believed to be a piece of shit, right? Uh, yes, yes. I think, um, well let's say Lummis is supposed to be a piece of shit. Okay. Well, I, I think that once we get empty medicine, medicine and then it becomes legal and then those people are doing it in Columbus, then we can turn Columbus Day into mdm a day. It's a great idea. Coming. Look, Columbus did start something in motion, but Columbus as a person, if you google them board, it was a terrible human being.

Speaker 1:          01:31:26       He was a good role. There was an account of one of the missionaries, I believe that was there on the island. I think it was a Catholic missionary, I forget what religion, but anyway, this one religious person, um, wrote this account of what Columbus and his soldiers that did do some native people and it was just horrific and you realize these were the people that everybody was worried about, like we were talking about a boat shows up and some monsters get off that boat and these were the people and what they had done to these for gold.

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       They found out at some of them had gold and they just, they just did a horrific shit. Very similar to what like, um, happened on this coast here. I'm with the INCAS, you know, the aztecs rather. Yeah. There's a story of Cabeza de Vaca. Do you know that story? Which stories? Alvara Nunez. Cabeza de Vaca. This is the story, a true story of people that found real gold, a Spanish conquistadores this, this is, um, it's been made into a movie. It should be made into a more major movie. What's that movie called? Um, children of the sun children, the son Jimmy. It was, um, I think that's what I think the movie should be called. I'm not sure if it was that. You just make up your own names. I like star wars, Bro. Well, like big foot and his buddy in space. Well, the story that out. I've written that actually this, this is incredible.

Speaker 3:          01:32:54       This is the hidden history of America. This is the first medium children of the sun is the script I've written actually doing man. You smoked too much pot before the show. Be honest with us a little bit. That's a little bit, a little bit. That's a fault of us. Did a little bit right? Yeah. Yeah. It's good for creative brainstorming and, and so the, and the movie the story. We'll just move you that you can watch though. I think it's, it might be Cabeza de Vaca. Uh, it's got a dwarf Sharman that doesn't really exist in the real story and it's, I think this has to be to hold true because it's the hope of America. It's the hope. It's a story of a several hundred conquistadores around 15, 28 trying to link up with Cortez blown off course in a hurricane land in around Tampa, Florida, and have this bunch of hundreds of these conquistadores.

Speaker 3:          01:33:48       Only four of them survive and they eventually, one of them is black, one of them is a more a slave. The rest are white and they become slave. So they start out at the head of the empire exploring and plundering, and then they get destroyed. They become slaves. So they get captured. They get captured. Native Americans that lived in Florida. Yeah. So the native Americans that lived in Florida, the seminole tribe, right? Is that them? I'm not sure which. They, they, they ended up running away and it takes eight years. This whole process that they go through the. This is the charting. So this is the first meeting of the black, white and red races in much of North America. Wow. And at one point when they're slaves to get some use from them, the Indians, the native Americans say they want them to do some healings.

Speaker 3:          01:34:35       They think they're special. They're there is a black person, they came and they say, we're not healers, we don't, you know, and they say if you don't do it, we're going to not feed you. And they try to do a healing and it actually works. The person says they're better. So what exists is, uh, uh, the document, there's a lot of historical documents, but the point was the ailment that they documented adapt to, I don't know what it was they do talk about. Um, but you wrote a script on it. Well, I don't remember the exact first. This was a long time. I decided that at some point I couldn't try to make the movie happen and also try to make Mtma happen aside for a long time, but it's the, the, the symbol I have set aside, but I haven't even thought about for a long time.

Speaker 3:          01:35:24       But I think that the story is important for people to hear it. Alvara Nunez, Cabeza de Vaca, they became healers and they went eventually. All they didn't. People gave them all their stuff. They didn't want it. They just want it to go to where the, um, where they thought what Cortez was, yeah, but hold on. How did they become healers? Just because they heal this one guy that they just said, fuck, this is our new job. It seemed obviously I didn't know I was magic. Yes, they, they, they were like, they were pressed into service as healers and some of them they felt were particularly more talented than others at it and they ended up with basically that the whole groups of Indians that would, one tribe would take them to the next tribe. They had the allegiance of all of these Indians and they learned to live very humbly.

Speaker 3:          01:36:12       They didn't take stuff for themselves. They were incredibly good survivors through amazing hardships and they saw their humanity with the Indians and they had sort of conquered through love through these healings. And then they ended up getting to where the west was to, to where Cortez, I mean we're the key stores where they finally saw burned out villages and people as slaves and they were taken, captured themselves. And Alberto Nunez, Cabeza de Vaca went and was taken as prisoner back and he had to write this report to the king about what happened to the expedition and the black men, Esteban, Nico, he stayed and he traveled up and explored a lot of California and ended up being killed by the natives. But the story Henry Miller wrote a tremendous introduction to this story about the salvation of, uh, the westward expansion, the opportunity. What it showed is that through this respect, through whatever circumstances they got, they, through cooperation and nonviolence, they had the support they had.

Speaker 3:          01:37:18       And then, well, the four that they didn't kill the four that they. Yes, 96 that they killed. They didn't get the. Yeah, yeah. Took them is not in violence thing. Only worked out when it got done. Like four people. That's not a good strategy. I would say that's 96 percent ineffective. Fucking terrible idea. Violence work. These four guys live to become fucking wacky. Carnival healers. I, if you have tons of amazing look at this story of, um, this report. And then he recommended a book on subject. Yeah, there is. Um, there's the actual original document that Cubby Cabeza de Vaca, Elvar Nunez, Cabeza de Vaca, the marvelous adventures of Cabeza de Vaca, I think as the translation of it. COUPA. That's the guy. Yeah. Ken Burns documentary on him called the West, I believe is what I was looking at. Ken Burns did something on him. Ken Burns do something on the web. The wild west.

Speaker 3:          01:38:20       Wasn't that a different, is that he did it on this guy. This is the Ken Burns in it though. It's a part of it. Oh, I see. Story first appeared that kitten burdens the West pbs documentary that first aired in 1996. Wow. Yeah. And this has been an opera about it. There's also a lot of people have sort of looked at this story and taken a lot of hope from it that um, even though it took a lot of death for these people to get to this attitude and, and, and the Indians were, you know, keeping slaves and killing each other, you know, but they were able to, um, have a, a different kind of. They got off the boat as those, you know, rampaging people, but, but they transformed into um, humanists and humble and actually Cabeza de Vaca was able to go on a second expedition to South America.

Speaker 3:          01:39:16       He was able to talk his way into it and he did it. He explored more areas than other people did without killing any Indians. And he discovered the request, who falls where the movie, the mission was made big waterfalls. And so he, he started demonstrated that he was a good ambassador between cultures and tried to still, you know, explore, exploit, but, but do it in a way of, uh, a little bit more collaboration. That's really interesting. It's really interesting to think of cultures colliding like that. Some crazy people from Spain getting in a boat, getting washed out of their course and landing in Florida, climbing all, trying to figure out what the hell's going on, getting attacked, attacking people being at war. And then four dudes make it through that and live. Imagine how cool those guys must have been like talking to them. Yeah, native American society. You're so cool. When I going to kill you, man. They, they became traders for awhile before they kind of trade d. yeah. Triggers. Yes. Traders. And they could, you know, they got very hardy and our would. Um. How long did they live?

Speaker 3:          01:40:26       Some of them. Well, this, the, Nico ended up getting killed. He stayed in Mexico. He didn't want to go back to be a slave and then he went with the Christian missionaries up into California and then got killed in California. Yeah. By native Americans here by native Americans here. Um, some of the other native Americans need a better name. They do. It's clumsy. Native American saying native Americans clumsy. Saying Indian is even more clumsy. I like a first nation that's like with the Canadians use. I liked that first nations. That's, that's their real claim right there. First nation because the bottom line is as far as we know their first nation, but we don't, you know. Well, we did a study in Canada with first nations people who were suffering from addiction because their, their culture has been under such attack, but it was, I'm Peruvian Third World Peruvian shamans bringing Iowasca to work with first nations people who were addicted with, uh, Dr Gobler Montay, Western psychiatrist.

Speaker 3:          01:41:30       It's kind of, that guy's amazing. He is mediating this excession run by and then we were able to, um, support the team that did some outcome measures and suggested that, that this, um, third world, first world, first nations people that these w, it's cultural bumping into each other all over now more ever than before in the history of the world. Probably. He's that cultural appropriation or. No, I think it's appropriation. If, um, if you don't, if you steal, you can tend to be a native American and hold your own pod ceremonies, the that and on, and red paint. I think the, the flattery, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. So I think it's like you want people to adopt if you think it's good, but they don't have to adapt your dogma or your rituals. I mean, I see that with our mdms, we have our method and we have it. Everything is videotaped. We even have it scored. We have raiders that look at the therapist and score them on how much they're implying that we're hearing with our method, but we want other people with other methods to use it and see how it works in other contexts.

Speaker 4:          01:42:42       Native Americans have their own rules, right. When they have in their territories, they can. That's why they can put casinos up in there as do they have rules as far as psychedelic drugs, they have their own rules.

Speaker 3:          01:42:56       Well, they have because on tribal lands, right? Well first off they have authority and tribal lands, but a lot of people work in the military or do stuff with the federal government, so they have the religious freedom to practice. The native American church is the US Supreme Court upheld and a congress that they can, but the federal government actually tried to limit it so that if you had to have 25 percent Indian blood to be part of the native American church in order to participate in the pod rituals, the states don't have that kind of racial requirement, but to try to prevent the spread of this religion from the native Americans to wider groups of hippies and others that like pod, you know, they tried to make a racial. The federal government does have this racial limit, but it's largely ignored and it's ignored by the states.

Speaker 4:          01:43:44       That's why white dudes were trying to be Rastafarians. Remember that? That's where white dirty, stinky people with dreadlocks came from.

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       That's how it was reignited that we're all fans of Bob Marley. Right? That's why they. I knew a dude who was a pot dealer and he claimed Rastafari and he said, this is part of my religion, man. It was like real serious. Right? In those cases, they've lost in court or they have, but they didn't lose the. What is it? Assented to die. May, what is the church, he said the son to die mate went up to the ninth circuit. It didn't go to the Supreme Court, but the, when y'all do vegetal, I just came from Santa Fe this morning and that's where the lead church, the y'all hall was located in Santa Fe and it was Jeffrey Bronfman from the Canadian Jewish Bronfman family from Seagram's fortune, from smuggling alcohol during prohibition, and then building this massive business as one of the grandkids. He ended up becoming appreciative of IOWASCA. And so he hired the best lawyers and worked on this case that they won a unanimous supreme court case affirming the vegetal, the Union of the plants.

Speaker 3:          01:44:58       It's, it's two different plants, roots and vines and leaves and um, you put it together so to the union hall were um, and they have legal protection in the United States. On the other hand, it's, you know, it's a church. Um, I went to it and I was hearing I, I really enjoyed. I went to it twice and the second time it was like, here's the myth of our church, the myth of the or the origin myth. And part of it was that King Solomon went to the Amazon and told them how to put these plants together. Right. And I'm like, King Solomon.

Speaker 3:          01:45:43       And so there's, it's just, it is a religion. Right? So I think that, um, well that's why, that's why the Supreme Court agreed with it because it's so wacky. Like, yeah, you guys sound like a religion, right? I mean, but it's happening. So they know that they didn't make it up. I will ask, uh, having an incredible effect in America. It's really amazing. The number of different people that are using it, not necessarily in these exact religious context, but in kind of shamanistic or personal growth or more or, or kind of little modified or, or even in these services. Why hasn't that religion expanded? Well, it's, um, it, it's being used quite a lot. There's a lot of ceremonies in California, all over America, all over the world with Iowasca. It's just, but this union to vegetal udv that. But they have, they're expanding somewhat, but there, it's, how do they have authority? They have authority. They have legal authority from the US Supreme Court. They're the only ones, the Santa diamond went up to the ninth circuit. So they essentially have the same argument that the, it just didn't get appealed

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       to the Supreme Court by the prosecutor. So that the new united, the vegetal I didn't say you. Now when the owl hoo and yell, when do vegetal they do have that. So they're locked down. They are, yes. And sends a dime. He is too. But as I said, if they want in the appeals court and when you got to get Richard Branson, you got to get Richard Branson evolved and start opening these bitches up like right next to virgin records, leverage records anymore. Why haven't they expanded more? And part of it is, you know, how, um, cultural integration, so cultural appropriation, but cultural integration, so they're bringing a tradition from a different culture, um, and they're trying to integrate it at a rate where it doesn't, it grows, it's constitutionally protected, but it doesn't grow too fast. Maybe there's a way where it could grow too fast and there wouldn't be the care and the use of the tea and they want to make sure that it's responsibly handled.

Speaker 1:          01:47:44       These are the people that are running your church. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. Jeffrey Brockman and they're just too busy getting high. They want to keep it on the DL. No, no, no, no, no. They out and lay on the floor. Well, you know, you don't hide by going to the Supreme Court, obviously. Yeah, but I think it's amazing that they did actually get the ruling. I mean, that's amazing that they're taking one of the most potent psychedelic drugs known to man. It's true and. But they got the support of mainstream religions because there's a lot of weird things that mainstream religions do for cultural practices or even hasn't a precedent been set with wine? Yeah. Yeah. It's most certainly a drug and it can be used by children in certain ritual ceremonies and it can, but it's a common part of Catholicism, like wind is a, is a very common part.

Speaker 1:          01:48:36       There's a lot of weird stuff in religion and as soon as you start saying that one person can't do their weeds, weird stuff, they go, okay, well what kind of weird stuff do you get exemptions for? And you look at their exemptions. You're like, well, what? You can cut baby Dick's. What are you doing? You're rubbing dirt on your forehead on Wednesday. Will you guys, what the fuck are you doing in the idea that one could make fun of the other assist at a certain point in time. So you guys have blinders on. Okay. This whole thing is pretty wacky. The Union Union vegetable, they might have the right idea. That might be the only way to do it. Well, the part about that that's really good is that while they have their dog man and their their traditions, it's about the experience. It's about the individual experience for yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:49:17       Rick strassman did it with them and he told me it was very strange. He said it's really strong, really strong IOWASCA, and they sing songs about Jesus. Well Daddy, what that like? Yeah, it's a trip. Yeah. I think you'd have to have a generous spirit in a way like, okay, it's Jesus, but you know it's about reverence and you kind of generalize and you're thinking about this the other day, and tell me if this makes any sense to you. If you have this idea when you go like when you take. I've never done Iowasca, but I've done dmt on multiple occasions, right? So I've had this psychedelic effect, the most potent version of that. Right? I would wonder if you went in with the intention and had these experiences with the intention to communicate with some benevolent deity that you believe is responsible for all life and all love on the planet.

Speaker 1:          01:50:18       If you kept thinking of that as you entered into this dimethyltryptamine state of consciousness, isn't it possible that a vast majority of what is happening when you are having a psychedelic trip is the word hallucination? It's very strange because with the hallucination implies is in this world, but we're sitting right here with tables and chairs and rooms. Something could. You could see it, but it could not be real. The problem with that is like what are you seeing and why can't other people? Can other people see it too? Well, if other people could see it, then it's not a hallucination. Right, so it's how do you know what other people are saying, we really don't right now. How do you know when you close your eyes, you're on a psychedelic drug. How much of what you're experiencing is your visual cortex interacting with your mind, interacting with these drugs and your your creativity and your consciousness are colliding and gliding and dancing together along with your imagination and in the hold on a second and in this moment, if you go into that with his intention, your imagination can conjure up this Jesus type character in the IOWASCA ceremony and he can be real and he can be what you want him to be and he could be a manifestation of your own experiences in this life that you've carried around as memories and carried around as emotions and that in this psychedelic state.

Speaker 1:          01:51:44       If you continually go to it with that intention, it's entirely possible that they do experience something like that. Exactly. I think that you, we see through our own filters and we see a lot of times what we want to see and that we can coalesce a lot of feelings and images that are pre verbal into certain kinds of symbols. Well, especially if you're on it and insanely potent psychedelic drug. Yeah, so the idea that we ever know the ultimate truth that it's not somehow or other filter through our preconceptions. I'm John Lilly wrote this great book. One of the things he did, I thought it was great. It was called simulations of God and it's like different conceptions that people have of God and how you get to these views and then there's a way to transcend that and see something even deeper and deeper and that, that we have these filters and so the culture is. And the context is more important than the drug. So I think one of the issues of the sixties was people had so much faith that they

Speaker 3:          01:52:45       wanted so much cultural change. They were so. It was such a strife filled time that they had this hope, this unreasonable hope that the drugs were enough. That the psychedelics were enough that they would somehow or other bring this connection to the truth to to this new understanding just by themselves and it's really more about the context, but the context and with a proper open context and in our case a therapeutic context in the experimental sense. Then when you add the pharmacology, it produces really unusual opportunities to go very deep and that's what I think we can show that we can do that and contain it in a regulatory therapeutic healing context that can slowly be accepted by a our culture and that that's really the of the value proposition that we're presenting to the FDA. The way you described it as why maps are so important, because I'm talking about making Jesus exists when you're tripping balls, I'm making your own.

Speaker 3:          01:53:51       Jesus like while you're tripping and you bring it back to studies and science and data and presented the paper. I'm wearing a tie. Okay. And so for us, yes, yes. We're actually discussing should I wear a tie at the 30th better or or not, but what are you going to do a. I haven't decided yet. I just dress like Jimi Hendrix, but, but the date that the data is really this, I'm double checking of what we think is true. Right? And it's a way where we have to have that humility that we don't necessarily know this ultimate truth, but there's no way to know. And that's not just humility, that's just a fact. There's no way to know what you're experiencing with anybody else's experiencing when they're tripping. You really don't know. We don't know what it is. And it's entirely possible that it's something that we don't understand yet.

Speaker 3:          01:54:40       Yeah. And so, so the reason I brought it back in a way to the science is that we're operationalizing its effect on symptoms. So whether you have this memory that is actually true. So whether it's Jesus or whether you're remembering childhood sexual abuse, whether that. I don't like how you tied the two of those together. I was right about the Catholic church. There was a little stop. A few things I leaped over there, but, but, but whether that occurred in actuality is an important question for the legal system more for other ways, but from a therapeutic, from healing, from a compassionate point of view, if this expression, if it's symbolic or actual, if it has the consequence of helping people come to terms with themselves and to get more acceptance about what happened. That's what we're looking at. We're looking at the outcomes. So I think that that's the practical part.

Speaker 3:          01:55:37       That's the science part. It's like there are questions. Um, I, I believe I, I, for a lot of times in my early lsd trips, I wanted God to show up and I wanted the truth. How arrogant is not busy. Yeah. Yeah. God doesn't have a lot of other shit going on. I remember from my bar where I was like, the very next day, Barb Mitzvah, what the fuck? God, you know, I studied all this Hebrew, so in my bed the next day after my birthday. So I was like, I was the same. I mean, like I'm not a man. I'm not any different than there was. And I, I, I, I couldn't, uh, took me a couple of days where I thought God was maybe busy, maybe a lot of people got bar Mitzvah'd that day and after like a week I recognize, you know, I'm not going to change and it's going to take something else. The ritual didn't quite do it. And then even with my lsd trips, wanting to see God wanting to have this clarity and not quite getting it, and then appreciating that, that that was a delusion in some ways that keeping the uncertainty is keeping integrity. And, and um, but there's that strong longing for that for certainty.

Speaker 4:          01:56:44       You're sounding like a dude who's rationalizing that he didn't get to meet God. He's upset. God didn't show up. The whole thing will be different, right? Because it's like aliens and visit everybody when he does visit. It's a very unique experience and it's real. I don't know, man. I think there's real problem in saying, you know, what other people experience, whether it's under the influence of psychedelic drugs or whether it's completely sober or whether it's been in a meditative state. The idea that anybody can tell you what you experienced or what you got out of something is foolish, so then it becomes a matter of whether or not we're protecting people, so if our laws are designed to protect people, we should do it scientifically. We should look across the board at all the damaging things and we don't do that at all. That's why the government never discusses cigarettes because we all know how many people cigarettes kill every year.

Speaker 4:          01:57:31       It's in the hundreds of thousands and no one brings it up. No one running for president, no one running for Congress. They just don't bring it up. It's not something they want to fight against because if they do, they'll get slaughtered with money. So it's not about whether or not they're trying to protect us. So then what is it about, although at the same time, cigarette use has been going down a little. It's still half a million people die every year in this country. It's still. Yeah, it's still. It's crazy. If it was just 5,000 people in pot, how quick would they shut it down? If 5,000 people died prematurely? Every year because of marijuana, how quick would it be? The Demon of television? It depends on what we do, about the benefit side of the equation. It's not. Nobody doesn't exist though. Hold the unit. You see what I'm saying?

Speaker 4:          01:58:12       Like 35,000 isn't dying. Right? But if it was the 500,000 or diving from cigarettes are extremely significant, right? Well what should be done, but we should do is make everything legal and then let people figure out what you want to do and not want to do this, which is what we do with most things today, right? Most things like cigarettes and alcohol that can kill you. We let you try. Exactly because no one should be able to tell you what to do. Man, if you want to Charles boot Koski it and just drink and smoke yourself to an early grave and just

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       scribble the coolest shit along the way. Who gives a fuck? It's all finite, right? Who's one person tell another person that they can't be Amex, jump or skydive? Well, I think you're going to have that. I want you to be free. I want to be free to do what I feel I should do. You should have the same freedom, but if you are hurting yourself, I am compassionate and let's try to see are you struggling with your own trauma or what? But, but not to try to, um, what, what do you do about rock climbers and yeah, you're just trying to get safe equipment. Either run with bad childhoods. He cut them off, you know, um, people can make choices about risk in different ways and I think you really, at some point, you know, where does it shade into suicide and.

Speaker 1:          01:59:32       Well, I do think suicide should be illegal. There's another one. Well, I think the, um, I think there should be. I mean, the, I don't think you should be punished if you tried to get committed suicide and you survived then fuck right. I don't think he need that America because I think it should be against the law and I think this is suicide when people are end of life and pain. It makes sense to me certainly, but there has to be a lot of protections. But I think there is this general feeling like life is a gift that I have and that that somehow we need to run its course rather than, well, I think this is another way we're mtma therapy will help. And I think that there's a lot of people that are haunted by their memories, memories of their past, memories of their own failures, ma'am.

Speaker 1:          02:00:23       Memories of things that they did wrong. And those things can really fuck with you. You know, people define themselves in this weird way like by their past failures like that is. That's all the experience they have. That's all they know of themselves. And they, it, they. People have a very difficult time just saying, okay, well those things are things that I'll never do again. I made these mistakes and now I'm this person who's learned. And that's a really hard jump for some people because they need some sort of a memory definition of their patterns of behavior and when the memory definition, when they look in their own memory and everything is just failures and coming up short and Mr Ren and car got repossessed. Those kinds of failures over and over and over again stack up and you define yourself by those failures and it becomes really hard to move forward because it's really hard for people and so each little positive step that people can do can be so significant because it alters the course, not just all like there was this Tony Robbins thing once. I hate them, quote Tony Robbins. It's got some really good quotes, but one of the things he was talking about was how it was just incremental changes in your life. So if you have two cars that are going or two boats that are going in this direction and one veers off course, just five degrees. Well if they both go 10 miles, this one goes further and further and further from the other one and it keeps going further. It's going, it's it. The course.

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       It changes the direction and MDM a therapy or any sort of a psychedelic experience that's boundary dissolving and an ego dissolving and it just gets to the raw heart of the matter and allows you this really intense perspective on it that's almost unattainable. Without those experiences. Then that person leaves that and they have almost like a fresh start in a fresh understanding of who they are. They self defined differently and that in itself is like a recipe for success.

Speaker 3:          02:02:10       Yeah. There's this beautiful part of accepting oneself and loving oneself. Even with all of these failures. Even with everything that's happened, it's not that you deny that it happened or you don't see it. It's just this sense that you can relax and feel that self love and that is what's so rare and I think that's why Mtma is one of the most popular illegal drugs in the world and why it needs and will become a madison and the reason that I selected it is also because training therapists reaching to the mainstream so that when we talk about how do we incorporate this as a madison, it's with healers. It's with doctors and therapists and I think what we found is that we have FDA permission for a study where we can administer it to therapists and part of our training program, we're studying the psychological effects of Mtma taken by healthy volunteers in a therapeutic setting.

Speaker 3:          02:03:09       Wow. And it's a double blind crossover, placebo controlled study, but we can bring in therapists from all over the world and give them an MMA session where they are the patient and they're seeing our method of how to deliver it. And so Mtma is something that I think will have a smoother, easier way into psychiatry and into psychotherapy because of it so gentle because it isn't so much ego dissolving as ego. Clarifying your defenses are relaxed and you can kind of accept yourself for who you are so you can see more clearly and then how you integrate that and how you make it so that that affects your daily life

Speaker 4:          02:03:52       afterwards. I think it's really important. You were saying about it being a magical experience, so one of the most manageable experiences or all the psychedelics because it feels really good. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like you're going to have a bad trip for the most part. Although some of the veterans have said, you know, I don't know why they call this ecstasy. Why do you say that? Because they're going through this trauma from their war. So it's, it's so even under the experience of Mtma or under the influence of Mtma it still, they didn't like the fact that it was bringing back those memories?

Speaker 3:          02:04:21       No, no, they liked it because that was her, this healing. But it was painful. Sometimes it makes the pain bearable. It doesn't make the pain go away or it doesn't change your memory. Like it didn't happen.

Speaker 4:          02:04:30       Well I suppose someone had board so you really can't imagine what their experiences are. It

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       could be even worse, you know, childhood sexual abuse and you can't trust your parents or you can't trust your circumstances are. Yeah. It's all terrible. Terrible. Yeah. And how people can get into these patterns. It's awful. And, and it seems like, um, through the technical Mtma is part of the technologies appealing that it's one of the things that we were talking about with Jamie before this podcast started. Before you got here, we were saying how ridiculous it is that it takes so long to get things passed and that the government, the dea is going to review marijuana in July. Well they have this thing in July. Yeah. Well, they're going to say no and we've been working to explain what they're gonna say no to. I believe that the request is that marijuana be rescheduled from schedule one to schedule two. Um, and that, this rescheduling the framework, if you don't mind, could you explain what the difference between scheduled ones because we're too far from the point of view.

Speaker 3:          02:05:39       So the schedule one is the worst drugs and they have no medicinal value, no medicinal value. There are no current, they're not currently accepted medical and there's no currently accepted safety under medical supervision and no currently accepted medical use and high potential for abuse scheduled two drug and these are the most heavily criminalized drugs scheduled to except for certain exceptions in schedule two, which are also drugs with a high abuse potential, but have an accepted medical use like methamphetamine and cocaine and cocaine and heroin and heroin is not in the u s but opiates, all the opiates or heroin is illegal in England, but it's been blocked here. So. But oxycontin's are scheduled who every medicine that you can get and scheduled chats essentially the same as heroin. Right? Isn't it? It's very sometimes more dangerous in certain ways. The psych psych, it's a synthetic.

Speaker 3:          02:06:32       It has very similar. Yes. Affects. Yeah, but it has medical use for pain, so moving from schedule one for scheduled too. There's been efforts to try to force the dea to do this, but the way the schedules are set up, there has to be a currently accepted medical use and the data is not there. And you. You talked before about you know, when do you have enough anecdotal data or. I believe that we are so capable of fooling ourselves into believing what we want to believe and to seeing Jesus when Jesus might not be there, that we need science. We should take marijuana through the drug development system and we should take the psychedelics. It doesn't need to. We were about to start a study with marijuana. I basically started trying to do drug development research with marijuana in 1992. This is the first time in 2016, but since there's no established medical benefits of marijuana that had been proven in any scientific way.

Speaker 3:          02:07:25       Yes, there's been a lot of evidence in phase two pilot studies, but the definition of real proof is phase three studies these large scale studies that you work and negotiate with Fda for the marijuana plant. Now gw pharmaceuticals is a company in England that grows marijuana, it takes extracts, sativex it's a teaching and cbd combination and a pill. And then they also have epidiolex which is cbd for childhood epilepsy. So they are in phase three studies. So there are people working with marijuana extracts in different nonsmoking delivery systems going through the system. But the plant itself is highly effective. It doesn't cause lung cancer if you smoke it, if you vaporize it, um, it's even less irritating to lungs. And there's the possibility that a low cost plant in Israel right now, they grow high potency trimmed buds for fifty cents a gram, $14 an ounce.

Speaker 3:          02:08:29       So I think there's public benefit in making the marijuana plant in smoked or vaporized form into a madison available paid for by insurance as a alternative to all these other medicines. But there is no effort right now. We're starting it. Six years ago we started a study for marijuana for ptsd and veterans, so we've talked about Mtma and the idea is to help people with a few MTMA sessions, not need Mtma, not need drugs, sort of reorganize their brain, but there's a lot of people with ptsd that find marijuana to be helpful if they don't have the nightmares, they're more present focused and they're thinking, well maybe I don't want to do this Mtma or maybe it's a supplement. So there's never been a study of marijuana for PTSD. There's been a lots and lots of anecdotal reports, hundreds, you know, thousands of people saying that it's helpful in different ways, but marijuana is a palliative meaning that it just treats the symptoms and it's used usually everyday.

Speaker 3:          02:09:30       So it's taken us six years. We're about to start the study and it will take us another several years to finish it. I'm part of it will be at Johns Hopkins, part of it will be an Arizona at 76 veterans with chronic treatment resistant ptsd and retesting one sample that's high thc, one that's high cbd, one that's kind of thc cbd combination. And then one placebo and we've got a two point $1,000,000 grant from the state of Colorado, Colorado to do this study and it's going to be a definitive thing. And because again, we're nonprofit, we're giving away the protocol, there's no intellectual property like that. And so there's a for profit company, private privateer that actually has bought them early brand and they have a medical marijuana company, venture capital and they have um, hustle, Arius Tilray, which is a big production of marijuana production factory in British Columbia.

Speaker 3:          02:10:22       Supplies like 5,000 patients. They're owned by private tier and we've given them our marijuana protocol and so they're going to use the study with our study, does with the same study design but with their marijuana and they're going to vaporize and they're going to, we're going to smoke. And then there's a new study starting in Australia. There's this guy who's grandchild had pediatric epilepsy and nothing helped. And then they tried to cbd and it stopped the epileptic seizures to a great extent. And then the father donated 33 million to the University of Sydney for cannabis research. It's the largest grant in the history of the University of Sydney, so they're going to take our protocol and they're going to get marijuana from tilray but put into capsules as edibles. So we're going to have three different studies, um, similar in design, but smoked, vaporized and edibles. We're going to combine the data and so this is the scientific process, but it'll take us.

Speaker 3:          02:11:19       It's taken us six years so far just to get the study, even started the study will be three years, then we'll learn from it and we'd probably need to do another three, four years, study a phase three because this is just phase two. And in the meantime we have to break the government monopoly on marijuana because in the US we're stuck with the government marijuana and explain that. Well, the police in 1968, andy while actually at Harvard wanted to do study with marijuana. And so the federal government started with farm at the University of Mississippi to grow marijuana for research. And ever since then the National Institute of Drug Abuse has contracts now. And so the University of Mississippi, a professor, I'll solely. It is now in charge, they're the only federally licensed dea licensed marijuana in America and the FDA is a federal agency so it can only work with drugs that are federally legal.

Speaker 3:          02:12:12       So the only source of marijuana in America that can be used in clinical research is this marijuana controlled by the nationalist on drug abuse, which has been anti marijuana with this contract with the University of Mississippi. And we have tried maps as tried starting in 2000 to break this monopoly and we submitted a application in 2001 with Professor Lyle craker at Umass amherst. And we won a dea administrative law judge lawsuit the second time I've sued the dea in one, but in the end they ignore the judges. They ignore the science and the politics takes over and so, and we lost in the appeals court in 2013. So the way I described that, we have this 960 grams of super pure Mtma, but it's not the appeal. The government. What did they say when they were appealing? They said that, um, that the government had an adequate supply.

Speaker 3:          02:13:07       What does that mean for everybody in all research or the research? Yeah. We show that they didn't have what we needed and also meaning that the, um, there has to be an adequate and uninterrupted did supply produced under adequately competitive conditions? Well, also did you factor in the fact of the different strains have different responses? Yeah. Yeah, that's it. That's why we're using these, you know, different, right. But the government, did they, do, they understand that there's different strains are associated with different feelings. Only recently have they had any CBD available. So gw pharmaceuticals started in 1998. Combining saddleback's was thc and CBD. It was up until just last year that they had the US government could provide marijuana with cbd in it. They've not been focused on making these things into medicines. It's more low potency research into the risks of marijuana and it's the final next step in the medical marijuana story is to end the obstruction on privately funded drug development research, trying to make the plant into a madison.

Speaker 3:          02:14:13       And that's what I'm, ironically, it's easier to do research with psychedelics than with marijuana to try to make it into a madison because we control our drug. So I'm getting a, a GMP Mtma I, it's the same stuff we're going to use in phase three that we want to market. But the federal government, marijuana can only be used in research. It can't be marketed and because the strains are all so different, we can't show marijuana helps for ptsd with one strain and then just say, oh, give us approval for any other strain. Right? So we need to use this. And this is the true for FDA, for other botanicals. If you're going to do a study in botanical medicines, those phase three study needs to be with the same, uh, consistent batch that you want to market. Well, I guess this is all important because we want the same sort of stringent process to be taking place for a drug safer arthritis or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:15:07       Like there's so many drugs that have been gone through clinical trials and wind up still, even after all that being dangerous. But the problem with this is that we know it's not dangerous. It's not like there's any question whatsoever about whether or not it's hurting anybody. Yes, and what I'm basically saying is about insurance and a science so that it should be. What I'm saying is marijuana should be legal right away. Of course people should be able to get this. The process that we're trying to go through with making the marijuana plant into a medicine is solving the fundamental issue that all of these medical marijuana states that have approved medical marijuana laws, the patients have to buy the medicine themselves. They don't get it covered by insurance. That'll only happen when you go through the FDA and you've made it federally legal. So the intention is to make it so that people can get their medicine so that they can get it paid for by insurance.

Speaker 3:          02:15:58       Is that the intention? Yeah, it's like a medicine, right? I mean, and so the way to do that is to make it federally illegal. That's the best pathway you think the federal legalization. Well, I think by I'm talking about fairly legalized for medicine, so to go through the FDA process then insurance companies, I mean they couldn't be doing studies now and look at the fact that people are using marijuana instead of a lot of more expensive pharmaceutical medications and that from an insurance company point of view, it could be wise to subsidize marijuana right now it just hasn't happened yet. As far as I'm aware that insurance companies in Canada, the Canadian government pays for medical marijuana for veterans, CSD. The Canadian government pays for that. Even though there's been no science are these studies that are. These three studies will be the first on marijuana for Ptsd controlled studies and so there's the likelihood that once we make it into an FDA approved medicine, insurance companies will then be willing, now it's federally legal to cover it as a medicine for what has been proved to be particularly if it saves them money on other medicines.

Speaker 3:          02:17:11       So that's the cultural. Of course. Then the pharmaceutical drug companies are gonna. There's gonna be a bounce back there. It's all really. The only thing that's holding us back is this nutty system that we have right now that's so complicated to make something as harmless as marijuana become legal. Well, well the system has been blocked. The system itself, when it's unblocked, isn't really that long. You just talked about how okay, civil war wasn't that long with with psychedelics. I mean part of it is also resources. Do we have the resources to fund the studies, but in 1992, the FDA had an advisory committee meeting that was about what to do about medical marijuana and what to do about psychedelics and should they be permitted to be studied as medicines. This was in 1992 the, so there'd been roughly 20 years of suppression of research crackdown.

Speaker 3:          02:17:59       After the sixties, the FDA had this advisory committee meeting. The National Institute of Drug Abuse convened a meeting of their animal researchers doing studies on psychedelics and other drugs in animal models trying to figure out what they do. They recommend that human use. The advisory committee recommended that human research be resumed and the FDA adopted that so that we've actually had this open door with a research at the FDA if we had the resources except for marijuana because marijuana was controlled by the nationalist and of drug abuse. We had broken that. We'd gotten her own supplies of psychedelics after, as their own supplies of psilocybin. So now the system takes, um, six to 10 years, something like that, of doing the research. Once you have a drug that you think does something to, to prove it, and that is take some time and it costs a lot of money, but it doesn't cost billions like the pharmaceutical company will tell you.

Speaker 3:          02:18:58       I mean, we're actually, I'm able to make md man to a medicine in part because it's a demonized drug because it's ecstasy. Governments over the world have spent over $300,000,000, probably more by now on research with Mtma. If you go into the scientific literature and medline and you put in Mtma or ecstasy, there's over 5,000 papers. A lot of science has been done but we haven't had to pay for about the risks, but even then when we sort of take that and then do the kind of studies that we needed to do with psychedelics, it, it feels like the system is takes time to prove it, but we are so good at tricking ourselves and there is something to be said for this process. And so I think when we talk about how come marijuana is into Madison, part of it is that the process has been gummed up for 50 years and is still gummed up by this last step.

Speaker 3:          02:19:51       I mean there was another step that to get access to this federal marijuana, you had to have a public health service review that was created in 1999 because before that they only gave the marijuana to government researchers. You, you couldn't even do your own funded study with marijuana through the FDA because you couldn't get the marijuana. It was only for their researchers. Ninety nine. They created this policy that would open it up in their minds, but there was a special review in addition to FDA. Dea and Irb that, that we just were able to succeed in getting them to eliminate the Obama administration eliminated it last summer, this public health service review. It's what blocked our marijuana ptsd study for years and years. That's gone. The last thing to get gone is this government monopoly on marijuana and we're working. We're planning to resubmit an application from professor craker.

Speaker 3:          02:20:39       We're working with Covington and burling and big DC law firm taking the case pro bono to um, do a legal analysis and then we will try to persuade. We were working with Senator Gillibrand and Senator Warren and others have been engaging the dea and on DCP, hhs, human in discussions about this monopoly. There's growing support in Congress and this is the last vestige of a sort of politics blocking the science with psychedelics or marijuana. Then the system will have to work with and in the meantime people can go around and legalize and then that gets access. And so we're not saying, wait for the science to. Well, do you have any fear with the upcoming elections? Do you have any fear? If we go right wing, that there might be some blowback. Yeah, I mean I fearful that all the time. I mean, my, my sort of core imprint was that in 1971 I first took lsd in 1972.

Speaker 3:          02:21:38       You know, I decided that this was what I wanted to devote my life to and I looked around and I saw all the research has been shut down. I, I sort of came in one year after the big sweeping prohibition. I woke up to it not when it was thriving, but right after the backlash. That's why I think I was so motivated to get involved with Mtma because I learned about md may 19, 82 when it was an underground psychedelic psychotherapy tool under the code name Adam, that the government had no knowledge of in Dallas. This was at Dallas. I know Dallas is where Adam Mtma turned into ecstasy, so that's where they started selling it above ground. There's an incredible movie that's going to come out, the stork club about the club in Dallas where it really got well known, but it because it had this dual life, one as this quiet underground therapy drug with about half a million doses having been used by around 1984 and then the other was this public ecstasy use. I thought, okay, now I know about it ahead of time. I can see the crackdown coming. Everybody could see the crackdown coming, but now we can organize. Now we can have. We can talk to people about it. It's not a crime where we can gather our forces and have people try it even, and that's where I became really politically

Speaker 4:          02:22:53       involved in the eighties. Well, it's just amazing how long it's taken, but it's amazing that you have the fortitude to push through for so long. I mean the world, the world and the consciousness of the people. Oh, you guys a massive debt. I mean a debt of gratitude for sure that you've been out there pushing this envelope and and chipping away. It's like one of many weapons chipping at this wall of ignorance, but maps is a really powerful one.

Speaker 3:          02:23:25       And, and we've been able to do it in a way where right now we have two senior retired FDA officials who are acting as our consultants to prepare our documents because they felt that there is a strong need for new treatments for ptsd. I mean they don't necessarily or saying anything about cultural change or spirituality or drug war. There's this first soldiers just for some other people, everybody with ptsd that they, they have watched over the last 15, 20 years what we've done. And actually there's a woman on our staff Ilsa Jerome that isn't been reviewing all these papers, all these 5,000 papers and developing what's called a in conjunction with other members of our team, uh, a investigator's brochure, a summary of the literature with a risk benefit calculation. How you take all of this information. And then what does it mean in terms of the risks that you present to the patients in the study and that you tell the doctors and the people at the FDA thought that we were doing it fairly in a, in a time when it was being distorted and all these different ways and Elsa is actually a little bit more conservative than I am and I knew that it was kind of good to let her take the lead and writing this and that it got the respect of the FDA.

Speaker 3:          02:24:43       So that's where I'm

Speaker 4:          02:24:47       hopeful that isn't it kind of strange that a mtma being used to treat ptsd is a primary motivating factor for the federal government trying to make it legal. Because if you think about it, ptsd, PTSD is inexorably associated with war. Yeah. So, so in some sort of strange way, war was responsible for accelerating the legalization of Mtma, which is really fucking crazy. I mean that is like the Yin and Yang in like a bio mechanical form, you know, that's a kito yeah, that's crazy. If you really look at what that is. Yeah. No, no. We've also though, what about the other, the next step does we've been accused of by our people have raised the cautionary tale, which I disagree with, but they've said some people have said, are you making it more easy to wage now or if you are reducing the costs of war, are you making war?

Speaker 4:          02:25:46       It's convoluted, more likely have an option and I think it's a worthwhile question to ask it. It applies to all medical doctors that worked for the military surgeons you know are are you by treating people, making it easier for there to be. I think that's a very narrow perspective. It's a very narrow perspective and it's also not taking into consideration the actual psychoactive effects of that substance because that's substance make someone loving. So if you think that giving out pills that make you more loving or more likely going to generate more war or make more and more palatable, I think the opposite is probably true. I think the people who become more loving who can relay the experiences of the horrors of war to other people who become more loving because they also get a hold of this stuff, then I think that's more likely to eliminate war or lesson war or at least mitigated significantly because I think that war is probably mitigated significant significantly now in comparison to like the sheer numbers of people like in comparison to, you know, 500 years ago, 600 years ago.

Speaker 4:          02:26:52       It's probably way less war. Yeah. I just watched a lexus fella, steven pinker just to. Yes, was very interesting about the reduction of violence or the. Well, it's way easier. It's way safer and I think that things like psychedelic drugs in particular, but also the meditative techniques, focusing on being in the moment, focusing on learning how to manage your mind and there's a lot of things that people are practicing and attempting to to use in their everyday life today. Mindfulness and it's, it's, it's a subject that's repeated very often and people are trying to find a better way of approaching different dilemmas in their life and this is a tool for those things. It's a tool for those things that should be considered alongside of yoga, alongside of meditation, alongside of Reading, self help, books alongside of having good friends you can open up with and you can discuss things together and get encouragement from each other and and maybe even criticism from each other and all those things exist in, in all sorts of different forums and they exist in psychedelics as well.

Speaker 4:          02:27:57       A lot of the times. I mean especially I find eating marijuana to be one of the most self analyzing, objective, introspective experiences you can have. It's like a real wake up call to any holes you might have in your game. It just smacks you in the place and sends you back out there in the world. You're like, shit, okay, I got it. I got it. I got it. Those are tools and there's a. they're all tools that can be used in a variety of different ways, but to deny the fact that they can be used beneficially at this point is really silly because we are finite beings. We live a short amount of time. Wouldn't it be nice if you got rid of most of your bullshit by the time you hit add? Yeah. And it'd be nice.

Speaker 3:          02:28:35       This sense of, isn't it, about time that it is. And I think there is a mainstream system that's ready to incorporate that's reaching out on the other side of yes. And that this possibility of really integrating this does seem to be the case. And I think with the military, um, I think that their training is to make people who suppress their emotions and to not feel the emotional consequences to act in the heat of battle without the emotions. And I think with Mtma, if you help people feel the emotional consequences of their actions, even if you've healed them from trauma and they want to go back to their units, that they are going to be more careful, more sensitive, they'll be. I, I, so I, I have, uh, uh, there's a German psychiatrist that I'm Torsten Passie and he's sort of raised this issue for me is what about the concentration camp guards? What if they were tormented and they came to you for Mtma therapy, you know, you're a German therapist and they come to you. Why would you treat the concentration camp people for their trauma? And I think the question is, are they, are people who are worked with in this emotional way for their trauma, more or less likely to go back into these situations that produced the trauma in?

Speaker 4:          02:30:00       Well, the question only becomes valid if you think, should you punish a person who's done something like that in always forever or should you try to make them better? Right? I mean, did you not exonerating them for what the horrible things they've done, but should, if you're going to keep them alive, shouldn't you try to make them a better person? Do you have some sort of responsibility to do that? I would say the argument, if you want to look at our civilization and the like the most efficient manner I want to look at it and I'm like, what is the best way to get our civilization together? We'll have less assholes, less crazy people, let's mean people less, you know, less psychopathic fucking security guards at Auschwitz. So if you do have one, you could probably get a lot of data from studying that guy and he's obviously going to be in jail for the rest of his life. Was not going to hurt. Yeah, I mean what, what I was trying to say is what you do that for an active military where they, it's not historical, but they'd go back and I'm saying, I know that's like, would you do it for a hobbit? You know, what you get on your fucking time machine and traveled back to the Roman days given to them. Well, you don't have to worry about that. Do you have to worry about people today? Right. And I feel that trying to bring that up

Speaker 3:          02:31:05       healing approach, that those loving feelings which Mtma can really generate through oxytocin and prolactin. The hormone is released that are in nursing and bonding Mtma releases those hormones, that drugs that women get when they orgasm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And actually tourists has written this terrific paper about how organisms the post orgasmic state and he's compared the poster orgasmic state and the hormonal release to Mtma. And I think when we talk about Mtma, a good way to think about it is the post orgasmic state. You're satiated, your, you're not striving. Dude. If you could come and it felt as good as beyond ecstasy. Let's not kid ourselves. Let's not kid ourselves. I don't know what come coming for. That guy feels like he's. Feels like he's coming on Mtma. Alright dude. Settle down. Settle down. If I'm buying it door summit of Mt. I'm exaggerating a little, but it just, I mean it feels real good.

Speaker 3:          02:32:10       MTMA feels like you're not even here in some the planet love, you know, I only did it once, did it once to two pills. Super powerful stuff. The next day I was wrecked the. That was not worth it for me. I definitely learned a lot from the experience, but the next day was absolutely horrendous. Well, it's probably horrendous because you wanted to do things. When we talk about people to. We're thinking about Mtma, what we say is don't do anything else. It's a two day experience. You need the second day to rest and reflect and again, what's the purpose of it? If you're trying to have this experiences, loving experience and then kind of bring appropriate some of that into your daily life learning integrated. Then the very next day is one of the most important parts because you're still halfway in, halfway out, you're able to think about it. That's where a lot of the integration work gets done. So in our therapy we make it so that people spend the night in the treatment center just so that they don't have to move, they don't have to get distracted and then there's hours of psychotherapy the next day to help them integrate it and then when they go home we call them everyday on the of per week on the phone just to check in and see how they're doing. So it's rick, Rick, Rick Doblin, Woodside. I feel like I just came all the time. All the time, Bro. Alright man, peace out.

Speaker 3:          02:33:35       We've got to wrap this up man. Unfortunately we started a little late and I gotta get Outta here. Okay. Um, is there anything you can direct people towards a website which is maps.org? Yes. And in fact we're having our 30th anniversary celebration on Sunday, April 17th and we're live streaming it for free. So it's maps.org/. Um, how are you going to know when people are Dea agents undercover? They're well tie clips actually. Um, we have our first reach senior retired dea consultant and Martin man and smart. But again, it's compassion. I mean he had a son who I'm listed in the army and has ptsd and is 50 percent disabled from ptsd

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       and is found marijuana to be helpful again, isn't it? That's what. Yeah, that, those, those kinds of stories that helped me think that we can do this integration. We can and I am worried about right wing backlash, but there's a couple of things that we've put into place. First off, to work with the military, I mean, right when gloves in the military, if we're trying to help the military, there's also people are compassionate about a childhood sexual abuse survivors and so I think that we have enough of a base of evidence and a long pattern since 1992 of the precedents at the FDA that I think we could survive. The FDA also recently did something very interesting with the abortion pill. Are you 46 that they made it easier on women. They eliminated one required step that the science showed that they didn't need and so the FDA is very much trying to be science over politics. I mean they, they will have an FDA commissioner that's appointed by and confirmed by president, but at the same time the people that are there are really focused on science over politics and compassion. The other part is that we have international strategy.
