Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Our screens, let's fucking talk like people. Man, let's do this.

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       we're allowed you motherfuckers. We're live.

Speaker 3:          00:00:12       Happy Birthday Joe. Thank you very much. Brian. Happy Birthday. Whenever you're less birthday was athlete. I missed it. Yeah. I don't like it anymore. Once you hit 30 it's not cool anymore, but when you hit 42, it's just like. I'm like looking at every time somebody dies, I'm like, how old are they? 40 eight on my gut. Well, he is fatter than me, so I'm good. Yeah. I was looking at this, um, someone's post on instagram. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:35       Like a friend of a friend. I went instagram hopping. You know how you go from one person's page? You see someone comments? Something funny. Oh, that guy got to say. And you go to his page and uh, it was a guy talking about his wife's brother had died and he had been suffering with. Is it you've battled his demons? Was the quote

Speaker 3:          00:00:53       six? I was like, oh Jesus Christ. 40 six. Like people are just fucking dying. Yeah. The ones that get me the worst, it's the ones that like, he just died in his sleep. Oh yeah, man. Patton, Oswalt's wife. Yeah. Yeah. Did it ever come out? What happened to her or do not know? I do not know. So sad.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       But you know, we all, uh, we all will go. Allegedly Bert Kreischer doesn't believe it for a car. She goes, I don't think we are. I go, what do you mean proofread on? You want me to kill you? Like what do you want me to do? We haven't previewed die. I know people, they're not around anymore. They, they, they died. So my, as opposed to just pretend they're not just not in this space, but they're in another space and in that space I'm there too. And they went through a portal or what?

Speaker 3:          00:01:44       We had them on a kill Tony a couple days ago and he was on this like weird pill. He took this weird pill and he says that he's like, he fucks with my blood pressure though. Like if I laugh too hard I'll just faint and pass out. It's happened three times already so I might pass it. I'm like, wait, you're going, you shouldn't not be famous.

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       Hey, your brain is shutting off. Your brain is like too much. We're done. Funk. Oh, you know, they say that's what happened to Hillary Clinton, that she blacked out. She fainted and hit her head in 2012. There's all these concerns that people have. I don't know if they're there. They're founded in any fact, but apparently the. The real incident did happen that she fell down. She, she blacked out and fell down and hit her head and had a clot, which can be pretty serious, but there's an of course because of that, there's people that are making all these crazy videos speculating that she has brain damage and she's out of her mind that she's like super unhealthy. Yeah. Like there's. See they'd taken these compilations of her, you know, look, she's doing hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of fucking interviews like this where people are talking to her and

Speaker 4:          00:02:59       you know, it's, it probably becomes mind numbing after a. It looks like she's having fun to me. She's laughing, she's bombed her head up and down and they're saying that she's acting bizarre. I think she's a person who's dealing with massive, massive amounts of stress. I mean, I'm not necessarily a big fan of what she represents other than I think it's Kinda cool that there's going to be a first chick that's a president, I think. I think it was good to have a first black president as much as A. People didn't think that that was a, you know, like important. It was important. Socially it's important. It's important. Like having a chick president would be interesting. It'd be interesting. I'd like to see where it goes. The problem with her is she represents like the oldest form of government. She's like, do you remember that movie? Um, what was the fucking movie where there were the elder vampires? You know what I'm talking about? Like there was the Oh, blade, the movie blade, right where they were the ones that were turned into vampires. And then there was the old ones who are born vampires. There were natural born vampires. Right. And they didn't like blade because he was half human and he was, you know, he was made

Speaker 5:          00:04:12       day Walker. He said, well, he was a day walker because he was half human. He could. He could hang around a daytime. I still maintain that first fucking movie, that first blade movies. One of my all time favorite comic book movies. Have you ever watched it lately? No. I'm not going to do it. Either breaks and everything's breaking. No, I'm not going. I'm not gonna Watch us and one of my all time favorite comic book movies. I fucking loved that movie, but that was the thing. So Hillary Clinton's like, she's one of those born vampires. She murders murders a lot of people is what you're saying? I'm not saying she merged a lot of people. I'm saying people that get into conflict with her wind up dead as fuck, right. Whatever. Are we what? Jamie? What number are we on now? It's 49, right? I think up to somewhere, as the Internet says it's up to 49, but now

Speaker 4:          00:04:57       coincidence or is this evidence like when we look at an evidence or or is this just will look at what these people are doing and the last guy seemed to be like a robbery attempt or something like that because it was 4:00 in the morning. He got shot walking down the street and Washington like know Washington's a notoriously dangerous place. Me and barrier got elected after he got arrested, went to jail for crack. He then he got elected again.

Speaker 5:          00:05:26       That's true. That's true. Right? And it's a beehive for crazy people because anyone that likes government. Look, the guy that climbed trump tower, he's a crazy person. Who, if you saw his interview he talking about yesterday, they don't know. You didn't hear about this. Oh my God. This was like the biggest thing for like three hours. This guy was suction cups, climbing the trump tower. Like, like police busting windows out of trump's windows, like trying to grab and get. Couldn't get him. He kept on climbing. He released the guy released a video like 12 hours before Sam, and if you listen to the video, it sounds like

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       a youtube commentor like it. It's just like, like I want to give a mess appearance. I just don't know how many people will walk this. I'd rather not be recognizable. I'm an independent researcher. We're good. I've had my fill, but it was pretty intense because he got up pretty high and could for awhile. I didn't think the police were going to be able to do anything but watching them work in their, their tactics to catch a guy that has suction cups, cups. Very interesting. This is when they pull him in and he, he means stone. It's like right here at me and he's. But he's still connected to the rope. There's probably beating the fuck out of here it is. Dick's getting together, trying to undo them. They're just going to cut it. No, they ended up pulling it off somehow. But they destroyed that, that, that building.

Speaker 3:          00:06:47       They broke a lot of windows. Cut a lot of like crates or uh, air conditioning. What a crazy fucker. Yeah. It not what happens to a guy like that. How long you go to jail for. Wow. I don't know that. So I think that's a. whilst the charges today, I was going to look at that second. I think mental, he's gonna be in a mental hospital more so than a a, a jail it seems like, but these kind of people or the people that hang out in like Washington DC and stuff. That's why DC or Washington so a so dangerous, you know, it's, it's because they're attracted to this crazy thing that's already happening.

Speaker 1:          00:07:23       A hive of government and everybody knows it's got to a centralized location because the hive, Washington DC's the hive of our government and the penthouse is a or the Pentagon. Penthouse. The Pentagon is not that far from there. Right. How far is that? It's in Virginia, right? How far by air is the Pentagon or the White House? Yeah, they're fairly close to each other, right? Probably be like a 12 hour drive. Something like that I guess isn't. I don't know that whole area though. I would imagine. And there's also that giant community of lobbyists that lives in Virginia just outside of Washington dc that, uh, Brian Cowen was telling me some of the richest people per capita in the country,

Speaker 3:          00:08:08       right? Pc Cemetery. It's just across the river from. And I'm pretty sure it was pretty close. Oh Wow. I was way off. I had no idea it was that close to all of our driver. It's a 12 minute walk from the Pentagon. I mean, it's just literally really across the river. Holy Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       I thought it was more like a half hour away in bad traffic. But yeah, maybe that's what it is. I thought it was like a over the river and through the woods to grandmother's house. We go. It's close as fuck. So the point being that that's a, that's a hub. So that one last guy that got shot, man, anybody who get shot in Washington DC walking around the street at 4:00 in the morning and get shot, it can happen. You can zig zagged. You could rock it to the wrong dude at the wrong time. And it can happen. It's just part of living in a high crime area, so who knows if that one was, but there's a gang of them that are connected to the Clintons that just wound them getting whacked.

Speaker 3:          00:09:03       Did you see all the crime that's been going on in the Olympics? Like I sent Jamie this video of in Brazil and it's just a collection of like the first or second day of the. They have like these people just watching the streets for crime and it's just tons of these petty theft like people getting, trying to just steal people's stuff and this video, I mean this came out I think the first or second day, but this video is nonstop. It's just happening like people just coming up and trying to steal people's cell phones and some guys are really smart with it. They get on these bikes and you now when you're looking at your cell phone, you're just kind of holding it barely and people are just coming up and taking their phones on bikes and then taking off and it's. It's crazy. This guy is the biggest pussy in the road by the way. Right here. Look how small that little kid is and he knows like guys following him, he's getting close to his girl and he's just not doing anything and then this kid ends up stealing something from the guy in front of them. Wow. Right here. Blank. Hey Man. That's just taking part of the process. Yeah. Some people

Speaker 1:          00:10:09       super disenfranchise and poor and that was something that Byron bowers who talked about in the podcast, the difference between people that are just trying to survive, they're just trying to survive. Man. That is a totally different world that grow and fight at all. She's just like, just give it up. Okay. Um, so how many people have supposedly been whacked?

Speaker 3:          00:10:29       What does the Internet believe? I think it was 49.

Speaker 1:          00:10:34       Oh, I got to find the. But is there anybody that makes a compelling case? It says 96. Right? I don't know if that's. I mean it depends on which website you want to look up and find who was conspiracy. Do you want to dig down? It's on snoopy's or snopes? No. Here's what one of the weirdest things about government is that it affects all of us right in this room, but we couldn't be further away from the type of person that would want to run the government. Like I don't want to run shit. You don't want to run shit. You know, like the type of people that do want to do that. They are so not like most people. Most people do not want to run everybody. When you get people that are in that like higher echelon of government and they have the ability literally to manipulate which way the country thinks that without really persuasive, articulate speech, they really have the opportunity to change the way the country feels about itself. You know, like, like Kennedy, like his summer Kennedy's speeches. You would, you would listen to them and you would want to be a better person. You hear that guy talk and he, he said such poetic shit. It was so brilliant and the way he was able to communicate and a

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       lot of blase, like a lot of people thought Obama was going to be like that too because it seemed like he kind of was when he was running for office and we seemed like when this guy gets in, man, he's going to make some of those Kennedy type speeches and he made some really good speeches for sure, but it always felt like he was. Everything was down the middle, like everything was like a 90 Sitcom, you know? It's like there was not much chances being taken. It was like you wanted Seinfeld and you got mad about you. You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          00:12:26       You know what I'm saying? Not that there's anything wrong with mad about you. So fine program went along on a long time. A lot of people enjoyed it, you know, but it wasn't curb your enthusiasm. You know, there's, there's, there's, when, when a guy comes out like Obama and his speeches at the Democratic convention before he was elected, he was like, Holy Shit. Like this is going to be the guy who's going to be this super articulate, powerful, powerful guy who writes all the wrongs, so one of two options, either one, he was never really liked that and it was just tricking us and is brilliant. Like a portrayal of this rebel of this person who's gonna come in and give you hope and change or two, you get in there and the sobering effect of what you're presented with every day makes you realize like, oh my God, they're just running around putting out fires all the time. There's a fucking like what you're seeing from those kids in that video in the Olympics where these people are getting a purse snatched and shit. Tourists are getting personality pick pocketed. That is just what happens when things are all fucked up and unbalanced. That's what happens. It's just what happened.

Speaker 3:          00:13:41       That's just a whole mess. Like do you think this is the end of the Olympics? Just based on like how much trouble this Olympics has been, you know, looking at all the hotel rooms where the sinks are falling through the counters and how the water. I don't know if you saw the water today is green because they have an allergy problem or something like that and if you look at all the past Olympics and how all the structures, there's a website where it shows like all the Olympics and how it just, they have all these concrete things that are just now overrun by a trees and weeds and stuff and how much it costs to make all this and now it's just ruined land. You know, you can't. Once you put concrete on land it's pretty much ruined you. It's really hard for it to ever be farmed on again or things to grow when there's concrete on there.

Speaker 6:          00:14:28       Yeah, I guess it makes sense that you'd have to look at this. I mean this is just things apart.

Speaker 3:          00:14:32       This is old and as 1984 Olympics, just try. It looks trashy.

Speaker 6:          00:14:36       Oh, they were using for a bike course. So that's kind of done. It looks fun. Where's that? Where's that? Sarah Yandell. Bosnia. Heres A. Hers have a golden. Yeah. How do you say that? Hers is hers. It governing his or Grovedale is a scrolled up. So we see that, so we'll look at that man, that looks fun as fuck. These dudes are on the Bob sled run, but it's all graffiti'd up and they're riding bikes on it. That looks fucking bad ass man. If you lived there dude. Yeah. That would be the coolest shit ever. If you were a kid and you were growing up in that neighborhood, but that's probably like a. was probably got a lot of bullets in that neighborhood too. It looks like. Yeah, that's what they're writing away from rape.

Speaker 6:          00:15:20       Like all this land, this land is just ruined. You know, all skills and had dope though. It's kind of dope right now, but in 20 years that's going to look even shittier. Look at that. A mosquito. That's where Zika was born probably, right? We're looking at it right now and we're. As we're scrolling through these pictures for people were just listening to the audio. These things were available where Jamie daily May I just typed in the old Olympic venues. This story will pop up if you google it. Olympic venue. This one right here is not even eight years old from China. God Damn, this is crazy. Look man, like look at these buildings. They're just completely deteriorating and falling apart here. What was this? A graveyard? There's a graveyard and the site of the 1984 Olympics. So they had the side of the Olympics in Sarajevo and then he turned to a graveyard.

Speaker 6:          00:16:06       Hm, okay. Oh, that looks fun. To skateboard. Yeah. They have this crazy skin ramps ski jumps from 84 Olympics. Wow. This is a really fascinating man that we. We do this, you know, but I'll tell you man, they got me. I was watching it the other day where you. Yup. They got me. Those fuckers now have A. I heard a lot of criticism of it being a fluff piece this year. A lot of people saying like, Hey, I don't want to look at all these stories that we're watching. America's got talent. I want us just to see sports in the Olympics. Yeah, there's something to that for sure. You know, they're trying to create stars and make a lot of money and make a lot of Michael Phelps type people out of it. The more Michael Show. Yeah. Yeah. The more Michael Phelps people come along to, the more that's going to happen, the more you get these super successful guys that can.

Speaker 6:          00:16:53       They can, you know how many limpic gold medals that guy won like 28 or something crazy white too. I think you'd have to saying here's a crazy picture of him in the pool from this past Olympics and he swimming and the guy he's beating is looking at him and there was a meme that said, this is the perfect example of losers. Focus on winners. Winners. Winners focus on winning because he's like just fucking laser beam straight on the target and the. Yeah. The guy's looking at him like, fuck yeah, I remember when that picture is so classic. That is a man saying, fuck. I mean when I was back in the day, believe it or not, I was on track. I remember winning the best tips was never looked back because every time he looked back, that takes like a second off your time. And, and that's the same thing. If that's what he's doing it, you know, he might not, he might just be breathing and you might be breathing, but it certainly looks like he's looking right at Michael Phelps. So it's good for the narrative.

Speaker 6:          00:17:51       It's A. It's interesting that Michael Phelps won all those gold medals in swimming and then he became this huge swimming star because think about how many swimming stars I've been. How many other is Greg Louganis who was more of a diving star that a swimming star? Name me another famous swimmer. Summer Sanders. I don't know who the fuck that is. She's not famous like Michael Phelps that even the neighborhood. I've never been heard of her. No, no fence Ma'am does nickelodeon shows? Oh, she did? Okay. That's Kinda cool. But Michael Phelps is like, here's the, here's how I feel about sports. If I know your name, God damn. He wants to be famous because I barely pay attention. So that's how I looked like I knew about Michael Phelps years and years and years and years ago. So if I know about him, he's got to be famous as fuck. It's crazy that like every now and then a sport, we'll give you a one super famous person like one Lance Armstrong, Tony Hawk, and then once we got one of those, that's it.

Speaker 6:          00:18:56       You Got Michael Phelps. There was all these other guys that were on a relay with him. They didn't even mention that fucking Niggas over here. Nobody cares about that guy. They barely paid attention. They just focused all on Phillips Golf. Name three names and golf. Oh, this guy. That's right. Mark Spitz. That's right. I don't remember that guy. He was a [inaudible] 76 Olympics I think. Is that right? It has to be. He looks like Burt Reynolds from deliverance was 72 72. Yeah, man. That's right. I forgot about that guy. Okay. So he was the first of the um, the superstar Michael Phelps type swimmer dudes I think before, I want to say before Phelps came along and I really don't know, but I think that Spitz was the guy who won the most gold medals up until that moment. And then Phelps just fucking blew him out of the water.

Speaker 6:          00:19:42       Where is he now? Um, if I had to guess by the way it looks and an burt reynolds movie from the Nineteen Seventies. Yeah, look at him. I hope that guy still rocks that. Look. I wonder if being in water more than a more average, the average person is better or worse for your, your skin. For every. Probably worse because chlorine is not good for you. Sure. It's not good for you. Chlorine kills everything that's in the water, but it also fucks with the floor of your own skin. Like it's not the best stuff in the world for your skin. I mean it's sterile water. What about saltwater? That's probably better for you. Yeah. Let's say salt. Water is better for you. Yeah. So water is interesting man, because I can't get it in my eyes. I know some people can get it in their eyes. They don't have a problem with it. I get in my eyes and fucking stings. I don't know why. Like when I go to, uh, the, uh, the beach, if I get water in my eyes, it fucking stinks. Is that add to your sodium levels? Mark Spitz wasn't even using a swim cap. When you're saying in your eyes were stinging. He doesn't have goggles on either. He's got. Yeah, but I'm talking about a pool. He swam in a pool and the ocean is where my eyes sting. But uh, yeah. Mark Spitz was old school is. Fuck you probably swam in a flannel shirt.

Speaker 6:          00:21:00       Those look at his body. Short shorts have probably made from like red dye number nine. They didn't do any strength and conditioning back there stops throwing me. Just men in their underwear. Jamie stop it. The iconic speedo endures. So this a go to full body on this gentlemen. Look at his fucking body man. It's like, you mean, I guess he kind of looks like an athlete or he looks like a, your girlfriend's brother that's staying with her over the. You know, you get up in the morning, you meet him for the first time. Well how are you doing man? Nice to meet you. Oh Hey man. Y'All got soap. Like that's what he looks like. He's like some, some weird fucking dude might've worked out a couple of times in his underwear. Like, why are you just standing your in your underwear like that dude with gold chains around your neck? This is a fucking strange picture.

Speaker 6:          00:21:50       It doesn't really look to swimmer body either. Like the difference between that body and Michael Phelps body or any swimmer nowadays. It's like pretty different. Like his legs actually seemed kind of Chubby. They're like, uh. I don't know. They don't really seem muscular. They kind of seem sexy, but what I'm just strengthened. But does Michael Phelps do strength and conditioning workouts? I know he does that crazy cupping shit. You're paying attention to that? Yeah. Everybody's copying these days. He's wacky. Kids saw that and that. That falls into the chiropractor. Bullshit stuff, right? Like the like there's real no science behind it at all. I've just anecdotal evidence. There's no, I don't think there's been scientific studies done on unfortunately. Oh, here's a breakdown of his training. Routine warmup with Jack Knife crunches, three sets of 20 pushups, three tests of 25 to 35 and bodyweight squats, three sets of 25 begin the pool with 40 50 meter drills.

Speaker 6:          00:22:43       So it's mostly swimming stuff, which seems like in some body weight exercises, crunches and squats, but the majority of his stuff is about lapse. High intensity swim distances of 200 meters, 150 meters, 100 meters, 50 meters with 30 seconds of rest in between each interval. He's a fucking animal. Just think about doing that sprints with high intensity. What is a high intensity to the greatest swimmer of the world's ever known? Can you even imagine operating those Rpms that he considered high intensity when that fucking guy gets going in a pool, dude, get video of him getting super-intense, getting warmed up for his race the other day. No, I didn't say it. It's kind of funny. The Dude's dancing around in front of them. It's fast. Yeah. He's a beast. You've got to be. You have to have like an insanely powerful mind to be able to do something that everybody can do like swim and do it faster than anybody ever.

Speaker 6:          00:23:40       You got to be a fucking real super focused psycho mean psycho in a bad way. Oh, he looks like a psycho. I mean, that death stare he did fucking crazy. So this is him. Michael Phelps. What does it say? Stairs. A death stare of intimidation is going viral. Oh, this is like some compilation with a talking head person. What, what is the youtube thing where they, they edit every five seconds. You say something, say something. Edit. And it's like constantly. There's no, there's no, there's no normal talking. It's like you're on speed. Adhd for today's millennials. Started with natural born killers. So one guy is like dancing, like he's not even dancing. He's like shadow boxing. Is that going to have fighter team? South America? Why is he staring at Michael Phelps? And he's just showing off for him. Like he's like shaking in front of them and laughing. Michael Phelps does not give a fuck. He's probably happy that guy's doing that. You know, it's a little test, a little test for him to uh, just continuous stare of death. Whoa. That's pretty funny man. He's probably listening to some killer creed music or something. And His earphones because Michael Phelps listened to my dad.

Speaker 6:          00:24:57       He doesn't give a fuck. That is weird. But the, I think you just got to be that guy if you want to be that good, who else is as good as him? Nobody ever. Right. Who else was that intense? Nobody. Nobody. He takes it on to the next level. God Damn crazy people out there winning gold medals. Pretty fucking impressive. Smokes. A lot of wheat. I hear. Yeah. Sabika weed. Did you hear about the dea this morning? That really pissed me off. They decided not to reclassify marijuana. So they're keeping it in the same category as heroin and stuff. They decided that it has no medical benefits. Why can't we just take him to one of these kids that have seizures and just go here, watch, see seizure now. See no seizure. Okay. Shut the fuck up. You know, common sense knows common sense here, right?

Speaker 6:          00:25:47       Yeah. I mean that's, that's definitely evidence. But I mean there's many, many cases of that that is evidence that there's tests being done on these children in the real world and it's working. I mean, whether or not it's scientific, you know, double blind, placebo controlled evidence. No, but there's plenty of evidence about the medicinal benefits of cannabis. There's plenty of it. There's plenty. There's. There's all sorts of data that seems to indicate that it has some sort of a role in reducing tumors. It can. It definitely helps people with anxiety. There's A. There's a lot of factors that it does that like you know, when Neal Brennan was on, he was talking about antidepressants and he was like, they don't exactly know how they work and that's a really good point, but they sell fucking ton of different kinds of antidepressants. They know how cannabis works. They know that there's cannabinoid receptors in the human mind, meaning the human brain is designed or grew up or developed alongside

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       cannabis. It knows what to do with it, so when you take marijuana, your body knows what it is. Your body even produces some sort of cannabinoid response. When you run. That's part of what you're getting in the runner's high. They say it's similar. Is that correct? I think that's correct. How is this a true statement that they add in there that they don't know the drugs? Chemistry is not known or reproducible, that says no current obsession, accepted medical use because the drugs chemistry is not reproducible,

Speaker 1:          00:27:19       not known, and reproducible means what? What does that mean? Meaning drugs. Chemistry is not known in reproducible. Meaning they can't create it in a lab. Yeah. Or they can't make two of the same. Maybe Maggie. You can't keep the same. You can't clone the same person over and over again. Every time he hits a different person, maybe because when you get it as marijuana, there's hundreds of different types of cannabinoids apparently, and you're not just getting thc. You're getting all kinds of other groovy shit in there too, but yeah, I think there's a ton of different types of cannabinoids. Let's go down a little fucking information whole young Jamie. How many things? I'm going to guess. There's 100 different types of cannabinoids. What do you think? I would guess over a thousand. Boom. Jesus Christ. I also think it's 12 hours to the Pentagon. 80 five. Cannabis contains at least 85 types of cannabinoids.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       Many which have documented medical value. That was 2014. They probably found new ones. Bitch. Okay, now there's only over 480 natural components found in the cannabis sativa plant. Okay, there you go. So that's different. So it's 480 natural components. So 113 different canabinoids says one in wicken in wikipedia. So you know, it's real. Um, scroll down. One more. The one that says how many different cannabinoids? Sixty four. Yeah. So at the answers vary depending on studying year. This is the most recent one, right? This is 2000. One hundred 11. I think that's this 1964. But if you scroll up it's the post is from 2015. Yeah. So I don't think this is old information right? There wouldn't be used in 2011 data would they just says that the thc was first discovered in 1964. You know, that's really crazy that, you know, when they're talking about like data that we're talking about like well they wouldn't be using data from like 20 years ago, like fucking ads. He didn't know shit back then when we really do kind of think about it that way sometimes. Like somebody sent me something the other day that was from three years ago and I immediately was like, fucking three years old, but it was a really interesting story, but unless it was happening that week, you know, so what that. What is that? That's weird.

Speaker 7:          00:29:40       That sounds like an assumption. Everyone. Other people have done more research up until now and I've looked at that maybe I would assume that a lot of times I think if I saw something that said it was last month, I would think at least five people I've seen it since then. And snopes stood out and wrote another article.

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       Yeah, but it's not even that. It's an actual news event. Not at non. It's not debatable. Just an actual news event from two years ago is bullshit. I don't give a fuck about it. It's weird like you look down, like whenever there's an article that someone will tweet or I find online or reading it on dig or something like that. If I find an old article or if I'm researching the subject, if I just start googling it and find something from 2013, I all almost instantly go. It's like three years old, man sold back then. They didn't know anything back then. It's also like two, three, eight phone generations old too. I think that's what you think. Yeah. I know you see someone like from 2003 with a flip phone, you want to go, you fucking moron. I'm looking very matrix

Speaker 7:          00:30:45       that they just had like those little slide out phones. No concept of what an iphone was even going to be. Then I don't think, and they weren't even discussing what that would have been like to have social media or any. They're just texting each other I think. And making phone calls.

Speaker 1:          00:30:57       Yeah. No, that's one of the interesting things about science fiction, is it science fiction is a really poor indicator of what the future holds in most situations. You know, like no one who did star wars or star Trek, they didn't think there would be able to communicate with each other in real time all around the world through video and send emails and get all the information, but anything you wanted to get at any given time wirelessly through the air and a little thing that's so small, it's slides in your front pocket. Nobody ever thought that was coming.

Speaker 3:          00:31:30       Now Dee, the day they just said how they're doing like the five g right now and how back in the day, you know we started off with three g or whatever way tbg and stuff like that and now I think there's only a few countries where 75 percent of the country is still using two, two g or three G and how they've run out of frequencies to build the five g. But or so now they're going to have to start just kicking people off the two G and three g and stuff like that. But back then we had three gene. We were like, oh, this is great. We can send text messages and we could send pictures. Now. They didn't, weren't even thinking about Netflix, hd streaming, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       I was just thinking, what if he gets kicked off because this phone can't keep up with the new shit. That's definitely happening. I was thinking maybe they should make a new phone called the throwback for people like Ari and then this phone just only has numbers on it. Can't even text. Call me bitch a windows phone doesn't even get a text message. Just gets calls like an old Motorola Tristar. Tristar. I was trying to talk. Talk

Speaker 7:          00:32:29       to my dad about this today. How important is that phone number still to like a person is. It's like because there's so many different ways to communicate and you can communicate through voice and video that facebook

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       through facetime, audio and Wifi. Do you really still need that 10 digit phone number? Change my phone number almost every year now. And it's nowadays it doesn't matter. It's a better way to weed out people that shouldn't have your phone number. Like I used to think that, oh, I had this number since I was 14, you know, and now I don't give a fuck anymore. I know I keep my phone on the sleep mode or whatever the, the moon that doesn't let any phone calls go through and it doesn't interrupt you with alerts or anything and, but if somebody calls you like two times in a row or three times in a row it goes through, but it, it, like I accidentally leave it on all the time and I'm like, you know, this is so peaceful. Not hearing my fucking phone beeping and ringing. And so I think that's important because I think we forget that we didn't have that growing up most of our lives and now it's almost like an alarm clock going off every two minutes. You know? It's not, it doesn't give you a chance to live like a normal life. If you're constantly updating yourself with twitter or with

Speaker 4:          00:33:39       text messages and you're constantly looking at it. That's what your focus is on. And it's almost like you're not even living your life. You're living your life through this screen. Like you're going into another world like this artificially created world and that's how you're existing in a world where no one's talking. If they are talking to, talking to you, like you click on a video, who you, most of the time what's going on as you're reading stuff, you're reading stuff or someone sending something, lol. They're sending you a funny meme. You're like, ah, you know, there's, there's, there's those things and that's like how people are living. Like people are like seeking out funny instagram posts, you know, and like I, I have friends that have, they subscribed to like 10 different funny instagram meme posts and just every 15 seconds they'll look at it, their phone going, ah, you know, and you can do that. Like you can be fucking perpetually entertained all day if you choose to do that. If you follow the right instagram memes and you have the right people on twitter that send you the interesting shit because there's always something new. There's always some new fucking crazy thing. You're going to be constant, constantly entertained.

Speaker 3:          00:34:47       Going back to the marijuana thing with the dea that they had that happen, they had to read or do that because the governor got so many signed petitions or assigned names that it forced them to have to reclassify the marijuana. I don't know what governor, but whoever it was, you know, if they, uh, they acquiesce to the demands of the Internet, right. We definitely didn't do it enough then. So. So if more ramped up and they say that they couldn't clot, reclassify that to keep it the same because they couldn't find any health benefits from it. Right. So what happens if the same governor gets all the signatures to reclassify cigarettes or alcohol? What would the da have to say then for the health benefits of those two? Would they have to reclassify it as illegal? It's a very good point. Let's try it. See what happens. I'd love to see what happens. It's a very

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       good point. It's a very good point. And here's another really good point. The classifying it in schedule one, because that's where it's been and because they're they claim there's no known medical use or it can't be reproducible. Whatever the fuck that means you can grow it dummy. You can get clones and grow it. Of course it's reproducible. It's just reproducible as a plant. So what they're saying is it trying to classify it as a drug, what they're almost admitting themselves if, if what we're thinking is true. If what they're saying is that you can't, it's not reproducible because it's not a chemical that you can break down into a pill if that's what they're saying. Like you can't standardize it because it's too wild and it's free. It's growing. That's almost a perfect example of the fact that you're. You're not. You shouldn't be in a position where you're controlling a plant.

Speaker 4:          00:36:27       You shouldn't have be in a position where you're regulating nature, but that's so you're almost admitting it yourself. It's not reproducible. Okay? If that's what you're saying, then you're saying it's not a drug. Okay, so, but as a psychoactive effect, okay, now you have to prove that psychoactive effect is dangerous. There's nothing that's the real problem. The real problem is classified in the category of the most dangerous, harmful drugs. There is no evidence that that's should that. That should be correct. There's no evidence, so that's where the dea is failing. They're failing way more in that than they are in even not admitting that there's medical evidence because if you wanted to follow it to the strictest sense of the word, what studies have been done that have absolutely been proven in a new modern form of like the most current science, what studies have been done that show the medical benefits of cannabis?

Speaker 4:          00:37:23       I'm not that many studies being done, but it's because it's classified as schedule one. It's a total catch 22. It's hard to get studies done because it's a schedule one and so you can't prove it shouldn't be a schedule one because there's not very many studies, but there's a ton of studies that have been done by universities. There's a ton of studies that have shown positive benefits. If you want to go back into history, even back into the Nixon administration, they were running studies that they buried the results because the results showed no harm. They showed nothing. They can't, so when you follow just straight science, there's no. There's no evidence whatsoever. It should be illegal. That's the most important thing. It's not evidence of whether it should be legal. That's like, you know the whole thing about you're innocent until proven guilty. It should be the same way about marijuana.

Speaker 4:          00:38:08       It should be that you can't just make it illegal and say it has to remain illegal because we don't know what it can do because you do know can do you do. You definitely know. Why do you think that millions of people like it? Are they all crazy? What's going on? All these millions and millions of adults that live in America, are they fucking crazy? So what are you saying? You're saying you're smarter than them. Why don't you talk about it with somebody that knows what the fuck they're talking about and you'll get buried. Talk about it with a person who's like talking about it with like todd mccormick committed Tom Mccormick having a debate with one of these dea guys about whether or not marijuana is beneficial. He survived cancer because of it. Now a lot of people have. We have friends that have kids that have autism. They give their fucking kids this medical cannabis and all of a sudden they can talk.

Speaker 4:          00:38:55       They relax, they stop having seizures. It's a massive benefit to a lot of people. It relaxes people, makes people feel good, and we have a government agency in 2016 that ignores all of that and wants to keep it in the category of some of the most harmful and dangerous drugs. These people that live in an episode of Hawaii, five o delivered in the past, they're like 19 fifties people and what they think they can do is keep this, this bureaucracy and this paperwork and these classifications in in movement and they can head off freedom because what they're trying to do is they're trying to stop freedom and one of the reasons why they trap trying to stop freedom is because they benefit from it. They benefit from stopping it. They have more agents. If those eight, if all of a sudden most drugs are legal, what do those fucking thousands of Dea agents going to do?

Speaker 4:          00:39:52       They have. They're protecting their own industry. This is a natural thing that any organism does when it's threatened and if you start making drugs legal and you start opening up that conversation like, who the fuck is any one adult to tell any other adult, what's good or bad for you? When a lot of shit we do, whether it's the food, we eat, the alcohol, we drank the cigarettes, we smoke the fucking sugar in our diet. All these things are bad for us. We all know that, but we were afraid it was the government going to come in with a fucking machine guns to stop you from eating a chocolate cake and smoking a cigarette. Fuck that. Right? I think we all agree on that. If you. If they can't do that, they shouldn't be able to stop you from smoking weed. This is archaic. This is like this is some ancient fucking vampire shit and they're clinging to civilization.

Speaker 4:          00:40:40       They are totally irrelevant, totally irrelevant. Your decision should be made 100 percent on the facts that are available today. You can go. You could research all the facts about matter. Marijuana. You find a few that make correlations between some sort of mental illnesses, but those core, most of the time, at least according to experts that I've listened to talk about it, the correlations of schizophrenia to marijuana use are directly in proportionate with the court. The numbers of schizophrenia for any given population that there's always going to be around one percent of the population that suffers from some type of schizophrenia or severe mental distraction. Illness. You know, a bunch of different categories. These little various mental diseases, but it's always that number, so if they smoked pot, it's just a thousand people that smoked pot have schizophrenia. Okay. If there was the same amount of people and they didn't smoke pot, it might be the same amount of schizophrenia, x, they might not even be connected, but when you're talking about 300 million people and you say 30,000 people got schizophrenia for marijuana, are you fucking sure?

Speaker 4:          00:41:47       Are you a really fucking sure. Or is it just 30,000 people have schizophrenia and they also smoke marijuana. This is the car. This is a real problem with the way they present the data because it's just like you coming up to me or to Jamie and you saying you've got new rules. You as a 42 year old grown ass man. You have new rules and we did. You don't want us drinking alcohol anymore. You're gonna. You're gonna come in and you've hired guards to keep us from smoking alcohol or drinking alcohol. It's the same thing. If it's a 50,000 people with some big building with three letters in the front event or whether it's one crazy fuck, who wants to stop his neighbor from smoking pot? It's the same thing. You're trying to stop someone from doing something that's not bad like you can't do that.

Speaker 4:          00:42:33       You don't have any evidence that it's bad. There should be a fuck load of evidence that if it's bad and it should be as much or worse than all the shit that you know is bad that you sell open and make money from taxes, alcohol, alcohol, which we both love. I love, but here's a great example. I talk a lot. They just recently released a study that I think this week showing the like they proved scientifically that wheat is better for sex and they not only did it for pleasures, but they also explained how when you have alcohol, you, you cheat more, you, you do bad things. You Hook up with people who shouldn't do. You don't use condoms. Like do a lot of shit that a lot of people change. Like I'm on team boobs, let's do this danger style, but it's shit that is life changing and getting a girl pregnant that you hook met at a bar that looked hot last night.

Speaker 4:          00:43:25       You wake up and it's a dog, you know, like all the dog. You're talking about a woman, a woman human. How dare you know is that slut shaming about Shit's actually. There was an article on a website that I go to all the time and I don't want to make fun of the man who wrote it because I love him, but it was about. It was about fat shaming in martial arts is Julianna Pena fat shames Ronda Rousey and Julianna Pena, who's a one of the toughest 135 pound fighters in the women's Bantamweight Division in the UFC. She's bad ass. She talking some shit. She's trying to get people to pay attention to her. I mean this will. Conor mcgregor did so a lot of these fucking people do. It's a smart business move. Okay, so that we all should be aware of. Right? I mean, it's not just a person saying this is someone. It's a smart business move, so she says this quote about Ronda Rousey and she says something about Ronda Rousey having fat arms, and so the title of this whole piece, she wants to beat her ass. Okay. This which she wants to do to Ronda Rousey, she wants to hold her down and she wants a mounir. She wants to elbow her face bloody. She wants to punch her eyes so that they're swollen and shut down.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       She wants to get behind her and choke her and say nasty shit to where she puts her unconscious. That's what she wants to do. That's what you would like to do, right? That's what almost all of these fighters would like to do. When they're locked in mortal combat, they want to beat the other person's ass and they want to choke them out. Right. The nasty stuff I made, I put that in myself. I'm in, you know, point being. I've seen people say some nasty shit to people whether choking them out by the way, but point being that seems to be way worse than Sanchez fat arms. Right? What's this going to look like? What's her face? Look beautiful. We're going opinions. Beautiful. She's beautiful, she's beautiful, but. So it's Ronda Rousey, but she said, you know that she said something about Ronda Rousey having fat arms.

Speaker 1:          00:45:10       I forget what the quote was about. Something about she's over her and you know the fucking the tie. One of the things that it said, yeah, no one cares about Ronda rousey and her fat arms anymore. It's listen, that's a funny thing to say and you see Julia and opinions. He appreciated. Yeah, except for that knows. She just got beat up. That was a fight. That's all swollen up, right? They're not even beat up. She's never been beat up and she's a bad ass. She's tough and she's trying to make some try and make some waves. But the article that I read was talking about the fat shaming that women should never fat. Shame each other. Women fighters shouldn't fetch. And I'm like, listen, it's called talking shit. It's called talking shit. You can't stop them from talking shit by putting it to this new category.

Speaker 1:          00:45:53       Fat Shaming. What? That is the most mild form of mockery ever. A beautiful woman who has big arms, she'll fucking throw you on your head with those big arms. There's a reason for those fucking things, man. They work. I did date a girl with big arms. It was weird because I say it's so beautiful. Had a nice body, but for some reason her arms are about double time. And so if she were the wrong shirts, it was very uncomfortable to continue to look at, you know, how you have those, like a sexual, actual paids when you're like a in your early 19, 20 years, you know, like 20, 21 you have. Like sometimes you only meet someone you've never seen him again. And this is a, this is even more interesting because it's, you know, there was no cell phones back then, so you couldn't really get in touch with people that well, you got to call them at home if the phone didn't pick up, they didn't have an answer.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       Machine couldn't even leave a message. It was weird back then. Right? But uh, I hooked up with this chick that I always thought I've thought about for years after, like whatever happened to that girl, she was a bank, oh fuck. And she was in the weightlifting, like, seriously in a weightlifting and she had a full on six pack. Wow. I've got a full six pack. She was like frank and she had these big ass fucking squatter legs and she was a freak. And I always remember like, God damn, like whatever happened, that crazy girl, she was fun. You didn't look her up, you didn't find her and if she's too big for me, man made me nervous. She made me nervous. I'm not kidding. I mean she was real nice and she lived like really far away to a thing. She was like an hour and a half away from me. An hour and a half drive, just, you know, those don't work out when you're 20 and you're

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       busy with a million other things. But she was a tank.

Speaker 3:          00:47:33       Yeah. I've been with a couple of girls that were in mma to mma girls type girls' bodies and it's not comfortable and thinking like, oh, this girl can kill me if I didn't like having sex with them was weird. It was just like, I feel like I'm fucking a guy.

Speaker 4:          00:47:47       We did a fica pen and the other day and uh, Eddie Bravo was drunk off his rocker and we were all having fun and talking about whether or not female UFC fighters, like what, what untrained male could fuck up a female UFC fighter. Like how big does the woman have to be? How big is the man? I got to be. We got the Cyborg versus Ray Lewis. It was one of the most ridiculous conversations we've ever had. And he got to the point where he was using like social justice warrior tactics. He said that we all hated women and he was insisting that a good day, uh, he wanted to have, who's a bad ass fighter. But she also fights 100, 15 pounds. Like how big would the man have to be for like a, we're thinking like a 190 pounds untrained man I'm on. And then we've got to be like, okay, well what's untrained? What if he has a year of high school wrestling, have a year of high school wrestling. That's the guy who understands how to take people down at the very least. And if he gets on top of you in 190 pounds a year, 1:15 you might be Foxville. Right? And so then we got into this crazy conversation. Then it got to blink. Seibold will fuck up any untrained dude. What about Ray Lewis? And then it got site.

Speaker 4:          00:49:01       So inside his twitter page, Ray Lewis, 249 pounds. It says Chris Cyborg, 1:39. That is a fucking lie. Cris Cyborg. First of all, I think they should make a 145 pound weight class just for her because the UFC right now has to 115 and 135 recognized classes and the women's division and they had sideboard get down to 1:40 for one fight. She fought a Leslie Smith at 1:40, so that's more realistic that she weighs 1:45, but you really only weighs 1:45 after a brutal weight cut. She's probably closer to one 65 five. Yeah, in real life, but they keep making it get down to 1:40, which I don't. I don't fucking. It's not like she's not going to fight at 1:35. She's too big, but there's a video of her making weight for 1:40 that she just put up. It's horrific, man. She's crying. She's like broken down. I mean they get so fucking drained and then they got to fight 24 hours later.

Speaker 4:          00:50:01       It's crazy. The whole process is crazy. It's dangerous and it's stupid and it's unnecessary. You should let these athletes like they should figure out what I think the real problem is. Here's one of the problems. Is there a specific weight classes? Right? There's like 1:55. There's 1:17 is one of 85 and in each specific weight class the guy has. There's a champion, right? But the, the, the variety of people like what your natural weight should be, it's really should be what you are when you're healthy in shape and you're walking around and ideally that's exactly where you should be fighting. The problem is people are going to fucking game the system and I think what we have to do is we have to shame people that try to gain the system. People that try to dehydrate themselves and fight smaller people. That's like contrary to everything that martial arts is supposed to be about. You're supposed to be. It's supposed to be about testing your skills and especially in the competition sense versus someone who the exact same size as you, so you're testing your skills, you're testing your ability against someone who is the same size as you, but if you pretend that you're that size but you only that size for like an hour because you dehydrate yourself but then you below up and you're much bigger after it's over. That's sort of contrary to what martial arts is supposed to be about.

Speaker 3:          00:51:23       Do you think it's the frequency of the UFC is how many there are? How many, you mean they're flooding the UFC? There's one almost every two weeks now. Do you think if they were like, you're only allowed to fight every three years, but we're paying you twice as much, do you think that would help out a fighters?

Speaker 4:          00:51:38       Um, I don't think that's the solution. I think it's good to have a bunch of different suggestions, but I think what, right now, everyone's locked into these pathways of fighting for titles. This is what I think. I think that's awesome. Don't get me wrong. I love when someone wins the belt. I love it. It's exciting. You know, when I get to walk up to someone and say, Tyron Woodley the new welterweight champion, the world. Like, how does that sound like? That's real. You get to participate in one of the most special moments of an athlete's career. Have a fighter's entire struggle as a, as a competitor in one of the most difficult things a person could ever do. So that moment is like, that's a crazy, critical, huge, massive moment for anyone. I remember clearly saying that to me. Should tate. I remember clearly, Sandra Day O'connor, Mcgregor, Tyron Woodley, Robbie Lawler, I remember it clearly. A lot of these guys. It's a huge, huge moments. Don't think the average person and even me, I don't think, I mean as close as I am to the struggle, to the fights and calling them all and being there. I don't think I understand it like he understands it. There's no way I can't. There's no way I do. I just don't.

Speaker 4:          00:52:56       So there's that. But after that, what do we really want to see? We want to see the best people fight the best people. I don't know if the title of champion is the best way to do that. I mean, we all are. We're all obsessed with WHO's the best. Right? And that is a good thing I guess because it forces people to fucking just polished that sword to the perfect sharpness. But at the end of the day, do we want to see. We want to see the best people fight the best people. That's what we really want to say. Oh, I say dia is double slap connor in the face at the same time. Like, okay, look, let me ask you this right now. If somebody had to offer you a paper review tomorrow, if there's a paper review they were doing tomorrow and it's Nick Diaz versus George St Pierre. There's no title on the line.

Speaker 4:          00:53:42       Who gives a fuck about a title? I don't care at all. I couldn't care less about a title if it's George St Pierre Versus Nick Diaz. I'm in. I'm in. Yeah, right. One hundred percent. I think that's the same thing with tyron woodley versus Nick Diaz or Tyron Woodley versus George St Pierre. Like it doesn't have to be for a title like I want to see that. I want to see what that is and I mean it's amazing when a person wins the title, it is a gigantic achievement, but what do you really want to see as an. As a person who enjoys the sport, you want to see a guy who was beating everybody, right? You want to see a guy who just keeps beating. Guys. It doesn't matter if there's a belt on the line. If I find out that Robbie lawler's one six fights in a row against world class competition, I'm like, he's beaten this guy.

Speaker 4:          00:54:31       He's beaten that guy. He's beaten Matt Brown. He's beaten Johny Hendricks. I don't. The belt doesn't mean a thing to me. It really doesn't. I just want to see Ken Robbie lawler beat Tyron Woodley, Tyron Woodley Beats Robbie lawler. I start thinking, okay, can tyron Woodley beat George St Pierre. Can you see George St Pierre Ready to come back? If he is, can tyron Woodley beat him or can George fighter really smart fight all law the way Rory Mcdonald did and Rory Macdonald shut down a lot of tyrone's offense in their fight and won a decision or is tyron better than he was that I want to see that. Is he better? I want to see is is he's super confident now that he won the title is he just. Is he going to take them to some whole new level? You got. You beat a guy like Robbie lawler. You knock them out and in one round you've got to think the momentum coming off of that. It's got to be stunning.

Speaker 3:          00:55:22       I would love to see fantasy UFC like a show where they take maybe the fighters that have retired or people that aren't as good as the other fires and have them like almost do like game shows, stuff like this. Like you have to do a game, go. Alright. So this fight you have your shoes tied, you have to hold a banana and not crush it. You have to protect this banana. Like it's a baby, you know, like fun things like that, you know what I mean? Like you're saying. But because I think even as I think as a fight it would still be fun just to have other options. Like almost like a video game, you know, where your doctor. I've told you many times something wrong with his brain and we need competition. Still have some kind. Like there's, you know, the fight is still a competition, but if you take away the belt, you still maybe want to have like a tournament a month, not monthly, but maybe a quarterly tournament or a second season of some kind. So there's something. Did you ever see, um, showtime did

Speaker 4:          00:56:11       in boxing with the middleweight division, that whole, um, series of a series of events a few years back with Carl fraud and bunch of other, uh, Andre Ward was in it, a super six, is that what it is? Super Six world boxing classic and it was super middleweight and they got the best super middleweights in the world and they paired them off against each other and this long running series where they're all committed to fighting each other. It was really interesting, really interesting as an idea, like, as a combat sport idea and you know, you think about like what that could mean for the future. Um, I think something like that for mma, mixed martial arts would be gigantic and it could generate a lot of interest and it could be something where they put up a ton of money, like instead of a world title, like what have they had an invitational. What if they, someone put together an invitation, they made a deal with the UFC and they made a deal with, you know, um, one fc or whatever the organizations are that are valid. And you have a tournament where they're all going to duke it out and there's going to be some sort of split of revenue of the paper view of this one tournament and you'll have this super six type thing like they did with showtime with boxing. Be Insane, man. That'd be epic.

Speaker 7:          00:57:29       Isn't fighting for that revenue also? Maybe good or is that bad? Because you could have extra problems with that. Maybe with people taking dives or backend deals. There's whatnot. I don't know. I don't know how problems come in with that, but

Speaker 4:          00:57:41       the real money and fighting is always in winning. So like getting people to throw fights. Boy, that's unusual. It's so unusual in a high end fighting because when a fighter loses, it's not just about losing that fight. It's also about they lost their last fight so then they're coming into their next fight as a loser. So they're getting less money so people don't like them as much. And you know, if somebody hits you and you just fall down and pretend that you got knocked out, you can't do that. And you can make money like that. Somebody could bet you or promise you, right? Someone could say, I'm betting 300 grand and you go down the first round, I'll give you a $100,000 for. I know you're only getting paid 20 grand and so you do that. And some dude that has totally been done in the world of boxing. It's definitely happened. I'm sure it's probably happened in the UFC. I'm not aware of it happening, but there's always the potential for people being deceptive

Speaker 7:          00:58:32       happened in every sport. I'm pretty sure at some point or another at one time.

Speaker 4:          00:58:36       Yeah. It wasn't an NBA referee scandal.

Speaker 7:          00:58:39       Oh yeah. Yeah. Tim, Donna Hay, I believe he lied and he went to jail for it too and he was betting he was making bets on things that he knew from insight information, whether it's like this particular referee calls really bad against this team because maybe he doesn't like someone on the team or something like that. They're not supposed to do that, but he was calling out information publicly. I think he wrote a book about it. All the referees also then said, he's bullshit. He's an asshole. He's obviously a scumbag, he went to jail, but when you look at the track records of some of these things that he was saying, it looks to say that there is some way that there isn't a little bit of water there, that he's something so whether or not

Speaker 4:          00:59:18       try to get that statement of. So I like to like where people

Speaker 7:          00:59:22       were talking about. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that fucking little bit of water in there. Huh? That statement holds water is what I was trying to say. So he might've got framed, I don't know about framed, but they might. He, he definitely got caught and what he was doing and I think it was betting store, like maybe what Pete rose did. Right? But then he wrote a book afterwards talking about all this stuff you knew and all this scumbag shit other referees were doing. I'll take your name or anything like that, but somebody wanted to talk to him and see if what other things he knows. Yeah, man. I would imagine if you have something where people bet on it, like professional sports or even college sports, I would imagine there's so many people that bet on those games that there's always going to be like low lives.

Speaker 7:          01:00:07       Like I know friends who use actual real old school bookies. Really? Yeah, man. They use real bookies. Bookies still exists. Tim, Donna Hay, 100 percent of NBA referees gamble when weird stuff was happening this year in the NBA. People always like to say that they're, uh, they are setting things up for money and ratings and whatnot. And they'll go to wherever he wants to write an article will go to him and get a quote from him saying this thing was fixed or this thing was staged. And it's unprovable usually, but he'll say it right. Should hire amish people or something. People, they definitely don't care or have tvs. Well, you know what man? A duh. The sports fans. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:00:48       Most sports fans gambled head. That's another thing that government fucks a song. How about that? You should be able to gamble on whatever the fuck you want all over town. And the idea that like money, one gambling should be taxed and that's why they're there. They're trying to keep it this. Listen, I didn't earn this money. I bet you bet money to make money that is so different than earning money. You tell me I earned it. Fuck you. You Crooks. Unless it's scratch offs or the lottery by the government in that case, gamble, gamble, gamble with a fun logo and a big smile. And you could win power ball. It's a power ball. Yeah. Fuck you. Fuck you overlords. Yeah. Fuck you for trying to keep weed from us. Fuck you. From the gambling or gambling destroys families. Gambling destroys families. My own family lost everything. Now he's a retard. Your uncle was a retard. Retard lose everything. They lose it through math. They lose it through gambling. They lose through sucking trucker Dick for crack money. They lose it through all sorts of ways. They're fucking crazy. There's, there's a certain amount of crazy people. You can't blame gambling.

Speaker 7:          01:02:07       You Fuck 1200 bucks if you win more, you guys supposed to pay taxes on it. You can claim losses too. Which is how some gamblers get through that, but oh, you did claimed losses. Yeah. They don't know. You don't have to say how much you gambled, I think throughout a year. But if you get winnings you can also claim losses against it.

Speaker 4:          01:02:22       Wow. I didn't know that little trick. Write that down. Yeah, it was. It probably audit the fuck out if you try to do that. Do you think you're cute? Check this out. Boom. Going deep in your asshole song. Look of her receipts. Look of her receipts. Do you bring your whole song? Yeah, they. They just have too much power. They can shut your bank account's down. They can shut your credit cards down. They could take and take your money from your boss before you go to court. They can do a lot of stuff that they probably shouldn't be able to do, but they have to get money from $350. Million fucking people. I mean how many paid taxes? Probably not 300 million. Right.

Speaker 7:          01:03:01       And there's so many people that told me they don't even do taxes. Like I don't do taxes.

Speaker 4:          01:03:05       Well, you're talking to like crazy comedians. It'll eventually get called exactly, but you know, there was a big scandal in Boston that was one of the. Shouldn't say scandal was a dilemma. It was a huge issue in Boston that I got to experience secondhand. Fortunately with the old school comedians that were super successful there that didn't pay taxes, it was a giant issue because they got caught and one got caught and another guy caught and then the irs people realized, oh, none of these fucking comedians pay taxes. How much money these guys are making, because you'd go to like certain comedy clubs. It'd be the same guy like almost every weekend. They had like these deals, like there were certain clubs like Nick's comedy stop was a big one. They had deals with the best comics in town, so if you went by Nick's comedy, stop on any given night in the late eighties you would see like Steve Sweeney, Don Gavin, they would be there every weekend, so let's. Places were packed. They were all getting paid cash or cooking or originally God, you have to say allegedly, allegedly. I never got offered coke, but I also never got offered money. I've never worked there. Really.

Speaker 7:          01:04:11       I like, I'm not going to say who, but a friend of ours, like every time you guys just give me cat.

Speaker 4:          01:04:17       Yeah, just give me cash. Cash. What the fuck on. I think I might've worked there once or twice ever at Nick's, but I was never in the position where they get off your coke. I was, wasn't in deep enough if I had worked there was like a I emceed something and then I came back and worked there, but that was after like had agents and they handled the financial part of things like later, later on. But those stories were always there. Those guys get paid and coke and those guys get, you know, but they just fucking animals. They were living like savages and they weren't paying the taxes and they one by one. They all got fucking thunderstruck and it was a worst case scenario because it was like, here's the comedy. Boom. Okay, here's like the eighties comedy boom where everybody's got rolled up sleeves on fucking blazer and standing onstage.

Speaker 4:          01:05:03       Did she ever notice and that everybody's doing that, they're all killing it, right? They're all over the evening at the Improv. Can't get enough talent because there's just not enough comedians. They just need. They need more. They'll shows a huge people love, like sitting in front of the TV, like vege not watched an evening at the Improv. So these comedy clubs explode all across the country. I mean fucking explode. But as Joey as likes to say that couldn't cover the spread, they couldn't cover the spread. Joe Rogan. People get tired of seeing the same fucking act over and over again. You're going out, you're buying a fucking babysitter. And that's what happened. It died off. So these guys made all their money in the hay day and during the day they're young blown. I bugged him, Da da Da da every night killing. And I told her, that's not my fucking Dick. The whole place goes crazy. The world goes nuts. They'd fucking clink glasses at the bar. After awhile they got a Mr Johnson. It's Mr Peterson from the irs would love to have a word with you. Oh Shit. And then they just go over the fact that they audited the comedy club and the comedy club has all these comics on roster, you are amongst them. You made x amount of dollars, we got paid zero. You owe as this plus a penalty, which is that and you just.

Speaker 4:          01:06:31       And the common cause of dried up and they're getting older and a lot of tired that drinking and partying all the time, you get worn out and then all of a sudden there's no more work. The work dies off. You haven't really done the road so you don't have a national presence, you only have a local presence. And then the fucking money guys come in and suck it out yet. So I'm just going to hook the strap to your spine, pull the fluid out. I recently had to go through

Speaker 3:          01:06:58       all my stuff too for the irs. And it was. Nowadays it's a lot better though, I guess than it used to be because if you're, say a comedian, uh, you go through and you just go like, oh, comedy store. I was at the comedy store, I'm a comedian, you know, and I go to the comedy store almost every single day, but you also realize that everything you do as a comic like that I could write off because the parking next door I can ride off if I even get Netflix, I could write that off because I'm researching Netflix, you know, and, and it's pretty amazing like how much you know you can write off and how much it's documented nowadays because everyone's using their cards instead of paying cash for it. Right. So it's, it's gotten better for comics, I think, you know now. But uh, yeah, back then I couldn't even imagine just having all those receipts and just being like, no, I swear this was for her, you know, comedy,

Speaker 4:          01:07:46       it's kind of screwy because if you're like a writer, you can do that to have your writer. You can say that you're doing research and you go to the movies

Speaker 8:          01:07:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:07:53       I don't do that. I don't know. I wouldn't. This is something screwy about it because like, yeah, I guess you could write it off. I guess it's research, but really you're just having fun at the movies, aren't you? You know

Speaker 8:          01:08:06       [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:08:07       I have this business lunches though. I don't know if you've ever been on tons of advice to work in restaurants where people would come in and would use friendship out of those credit and quarter stakes

Speaker 7:          01:08:16       for 15 guys are sitting there drinking whiskey at lunch.

Speaker 4:          01:08:19       Yeah, but not talk about business. This business in the sense like say like a Brian and I had a business opportunity for you and we want you to get excited about it, so we're going to take you out. We're going to get you drunk, going to buy some steaks and we're going to sit there and clink glasses together and will feel a little loose. We'll have some comradery because of this. Booze will be feeling good and we'll go like, I like this venture. I think this could be really successful. I think we're going to work well together. When I have a good fucking diamond click, that's a real business

Speaker 7:          01:08:46       100 percent, but like in a wolf of Wall Street where they're sitting there in this data is looking through all their money they spent on hookers and whatnot. You really had to spend $78,000 on data, but like you could, we could have had lunch at Mcdonald's or subway instead of having it at, you know, like the ivy or coy or whatever, and Sushi. We could've just got food. Why did you have to spend $500? You could have spent 100 right while you guys had to have all the crazy steaks and $500 bottles of wine to talk about this meal. It's the same kind of thought. Like what kind of fucking logic is that pussy. I'm just saying. I'm crazy. Crazy. It's been. It's been done plenty of times. I've had friends that make their living off of, you're not going to impress me, but Jamie,

Speaker 4:          01:09:31       what you're saying is ridiculous. You're talking about some big, big business on a budget. We could have gone to Mcdonald's

Speaker 7:          01:09:37       supersized. I'm just sort of making it, but like if you were going to spend $500 on the client when you can spend five, well then don't spend any money on your research to make your job better. Like just watch, watch people at the park instead of paying 10 bucks to get better quality research. You know what I mean? That's all I'm sure that's to watch people at the park. It's free. It's free entertainment and taking in a movie I was making. They look like a comics. Good. No, no. I'm just saying as a comic looking for material you have. If you're going to make the argument of saying I need to get material, this is what I'm going to do to get my material. It could be anything you want to do. You could talk about basketball. You could talk about poker to a strip club joke in your at a park.

Speaker 7:          01:10:20       Trying to think of strip clubs yet. That's what I'm saying. If you want to talk about strip clubs, you have to go to a strip club. So at this business guy making this big deal deal at d at lunch. He said, I have to go to this lunch and I have to spend this money because to try to impress my clients, they can't impress, not Mcdonald's. There's just. You can make the arguments if you want all day long for the thing that is needed for your business. Yeah. That's the only thing I was trying to say.

Speaker 4:          01:10:42       Well, you mean from the employer's point of view of allowing this to happen or from the person who's the salesperson needs to defend this action. I suppose it's, yeah, I, I could see both arguments, but honestly I think for a lot of the people that have those accounts, like it's kind of important that they formed these relationships. That's why business launch is actually an effective thing, so I would think that a business lunch is one of the rare exceptions of something that makes fun, that you write off or make sense rather that you write off. But I could see that movies make sense. You know, like if you're a guy and you're a, you're writing, you're a writer and you're writing a piece about modern horror movies, about the lack of modern horror movies. Like if you're a modern, if you're a fan of horror movies, fuck. You have to wait a long time. How long do you have to wait for a good goddamn vampire movie? Hold on for a werewolf movie, it's every 30 years. God Damn it. Every now and then they tease you like bleeding the ecl del Toro and that were on the call, but he's Atari. He's not going to fuck it up. This is going to be amazing. They fucked up Benito del Toro and Anthony Hopkins and it's still blue. Nicholas? Yeah. That was the worst with Michelle pfeiffer when she was so hot.

Speaker 3:          01:11:59       I'll tell you every watched deliverance the other day. That's a horror movie. I can't stop thinking about that. Squeal. Like a pig seen. Ugh. What a creepy, realistic version of parts of life that goes on every single day. Probably, probably. Right. That was a

Speaker 4:          01:12:14       crazy ass movie man. Is that Jack Nicholson? That is so dumb. Why is his forehead have zero hair? Yeah, he's. And when, when he turns into a wolf man, there is. He's the same size. Everything. It's like, well, what do you have more teeth? Who's that though? That's not, that's not him, right? That's not Jack Nicholson. I am. Is that a different one or is that another. A scene in the movie like CGI, Michelle Pfeiffer. Jesus. Who is that Jack made within? Yeah. Oh, that's what he looked like at the end. So there was like stages of Werewolf dumb. Remember this movie? This is eyes for something. Oh, this is different. Find out if there's a scene where you see what Jack Nicholson looked like. I think it was called Wolf. It was really corny. They like jumped in slow motion. Like whenever, like you're showing slow motion. First of all, you fucked up.

Speaker 4:          01:13:08       Horror movies should be about two seconds scenes like, like alien, like the first movie alien was perfect. You rarely get to see the alien and when you did see it it was like when he was a perfect movie in that sense. When you see in Jack Nicholson, who looks exactly like Jack Nicholson with a thicker beard, he looks like a Jack Nicholson. That would be a Barista in a handcrafted coffee place in Seattle. That's how fucking furry. He is. Always get slightly bigger teeth, which by the way you can buy, just like you can buy dental implants, you can buy those slightly bigger teeth. So you essentially could look fucking exactly like Jack Nicholson in this stupid wolf movie. You could get some fake eyes where you put contacts on that make you look scary. And uh, so he's jumping in slow motion. And as each jumping in slow motion, you realize like that's just like a person's body and something, even though it's not even weird. It's just a guy like this, these peanut here. Remember this movie he peed on James Spader never. James before he was in this

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       new fucking bullshit show isn't. Huh? That doesn't look like James Spader at all. Was it super? Nah, I'm just saying he's way too young. I guess this old thing go spader. That's 1984, right? I'm not disagreeing. I'm just saying is it 84 and 94? Nineteen 94. Sorry. Wow. Ninety four. Let's see what the wolf part of them looks like because it was really bad. I wish I was. I wish I was like friends with the people who are doing that. Moving back when it was happening, I'd be like, oh, she does whatever. How bad is this going to look? Come on. What is she doing? She's running as the wolf. Did we miss the transition? That's like half the Werewolf movie, man. Have you got to like Loan Cheney? See Loan Chaney Jr. He had an excuse. Go to tHe wolf man. The old wolf. and look at james spader down there.

Speaker 1:          01:15:03       Look at that handsome wolfelt's. Look at him. Look at him. See that crazy. That's that dude. Isn't that blacklist show? So he drinks a lot of water. Now go back. Okay. Just google loan cheney. The wolf man. So that was the wolf man from 2010 that you just pulled up. Which is pretty fun. I put it on the background sometimes when I'm writing just because it's like visually it's kind of interesting. What if the top one, the top one that's loan cheney as the werewolf. So this is like find out what year this is man, because this is like, oh, this is just a, an award show. Um, he's the classic wolf man. Now. See like the monster mash and stuff? Well, it was so goofy. It claude rains. Nineteen 41 go full screen. This is exciting. So this is a trailer for a movie back in the time where they didn't even have trailers. Somebody must've made this after the fact. Probably as the wolf man do the

Speaker 9:          01:16:09       Got bitten by a werewolf. the werewolf himself don't hand me that. You're jusT wasting your time. It will meet you. Don't hand me that. You wouldn't want to run away with a murder. I killed it. I killed records. If I stay here any longer, you can tell

Speaker 10:         01:16:44       these special effects. Good lord. Look At girls yelling. Sparely fighting. Just kinda gave up. She was psyched. The blood lust of a savage beast though. Both. Man.

Speaker 1:          01:17:03       I wonder if that's a real trailer of a fan created. It looks like a real trailer. It does, but I think they had trailers. Did they have? Yeah. Nineteen 41. Yeah. They had trailers back then. Did that. Really? Absolutely. Oh wow. I didn't think they did man. I know that for some movies, like when you go to itunes and you, uh, you go to click on trailer for some, like really shitty movies. They don't really have a trailer. They Just take a chunk of the movie, like stick it in there. It gives a fucking piece of shit movie. I did that the other day with some horror movie and I tried to watch it and I said, let me see what the trailer is. The traiLer wasn't a trailer at all. It was just like they just took a snip. What do you want? Like four minutes. how long you want the trailer? Five minutes. Not five minutes in particular. It's a good five titty. If I did, didn't put that in there. I mean that's a super common thing. I didn't know that. I wonder what year they invented the trailer. Have you had to guess? 40 six, 46. Well that's 41. 30 six. He six. It certainly looks like a real trailer. Like those fonts. Perfect. But how bad is the acting? Even with them?

Speaker 7:          01:18:09       Murderer. There's bad acting and movies that I thought were amazing 10 years ago. First

Speaker 1:          01:18:14       shown us fiLm theater in 1913. Whoa. That's amazing. Wow. And we've been fucked ever since then. advertising should be illegal, right? It's still easy. It'll fuck with our heads. I like trailers more than I like movies. How about that? Because it's a fucking juicy, Like they figured out how to make it into little sound bite.

Speaker 7:          01:18:41       That's what happened with suicide squad. Apparently they made that cool trailer that came out earlier last year and everyone really liked that. And uh, the war on warner brotherS company lists what I read, they were afraid it wasn't going to be that cool. I wasn't going to look like that. It wasn't going to deliver on that promise when they're also freaked out because of batman and superman that had failed so hard that they hired that company that made that trailer to re edit the movie that the director was making at the same time they were making it, so there's two cuts going around the same time and then they molded them together at the end of the summer. Too many cooks too much come. They too much in the egg drop soup. They actually added jokes. They had to reshoot a lot of stuff to add more humor to it. They ended it out the joker completely, but all you know is that the director's cuts probably. They edited out the joker with jared leto. They edited a lot of the joker up. Most of the joker. He's barely in that movie. I really. I refuse to watch. You heard. No, no. I read it. I ride him. He read

Speaker 1:          01:19:34       so true. He complained about it to. Oh man, he's not even in the poster. He look dope. Did you notice that he's not even in the post or one of the main characters as well? In all fairness, who the fuck knows what happened? You know this jared leto character? Who knows what kind of wacky shenanigans he was up to. He was going to send an. We're doing weird stuff for the cast and character the whole time. Oh, was he pissed them off? I don't know about the cast. He was just supposedly who's just became an issue. I don't know if that happened. Yeah, there you go. I can that coming.

Speaker 7:          01:20:07       I read somewhere. I don't know if it's true if will smith saying that I didn't research it, but I read that will smith hates him and he like, like publicly said he hates him. Jared leto. Yeah. Wow. If willsmith hates you, but I don't know if it's true though about the rock yesterday coming out publicly talking about it. Fast and furious. Eight cast mates that were being divas onset when it was causing a big rift and all of his classmates and closed like kurt russell's tyrese, a vin diesel obviously isn't it? A couple of people. He didn't publicly say who it was, but the way it came out, it was like an instagram post and so everyone got a hounding all of his classmates asking who it was and what was really going on. It turns out it was vin diesel and they like had it out in his trailer yesterday. What was going on with vin diesel? He's showing up late to set. He's a producer on the movie though too, so he's done. It makes a lot of money on these movies. Yeah, he wear sunglasses

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       side. That's always the weirdest thing with sunglasses. You can do that. If you're p diddy, there's like certain people that can do that. You can't do that. Vin vin diesel this fast. Eight p, if it was reportedly vin diesel. The rock was calling a candy ass. This is the best fire up promotion of a film that has diesel's a large gentleman, but I would bet everything I've ever made on the gentleman to the right with a goatee, like everything, everything. I know me too. I've ever made my life the future of the world itself. I bet it on the rock. The rocks. Awesome. He's, well, he's an inspirational character too. Like, um, he's a dude who gets up in the fuck. What does it say? The rock walks back, his name calling, but vin diesel lives for drama. Hmm. I don't know what that means. He said he may maybe just relaxed and said, what am I doing? Why am I wasting my time here? It is. Why? I mean, he's the number one most highly paid actor in the world. He's number one. So, uh, you know, this is going to be drama. There's going to be people that fuck with you when you're number one. There's that. There's gonna be issues you have working with some dude.

Speaker 7:          01:22:14       And there's also probably a lot of bullshit stories that are put into the, into the tmzs just so you have some prior advertising of a movie that no one even knew it was being filmed. You know, This isn't even a tmc. Right? This was his own instagram page. So it was, you can say that they're doing it on purpose. Yeah. I mean, especially the rocks is such a prankster anyways, you know, so it's, that's a good point. That's good point. Call to do to candy as does sound like pro wrestling talk. I don't trust anything anymore. Like for, for the longest time I don't trust. I don't. I used to think rotten tomatoes was completely legit. Right. but then you start seeing movies on rotten tomatoes and you're like, I saw that movie. There's no way. That's a 98 percent. How in the fuck is that? Ninety eight percent. Then I heard from somebody that they only pick the top comic art. Our top reviewers, uh, they don't use the same reviewers for every movie. So like they'll have like 10 top reviewers for this movie and only five for this movie.

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       Like they're almost picking and choosing them mean and we're talking about. We found out that it's like who owns rotten tomatoes? And viacom ownS rotten tomatoes come up. Fandango. Fandango is owned by universal and universal is owned by comcast and universal and universal and sony like. Anyways, so that come to the terrordome come on down and all that, all that fucking thing is is selling tv shows and movies that have. They make those. Okay, but doesn't rotten tomatoes operate under user? Like use your criticism say let's say like it uses the top reviewers. Yeah. Like there's 100 reviewers that they choose from. They choose from. Yeah. They don't use the same reviewers for every movie I've been looking like, like, like, like say like you're recommend a minimum wage. So you're saying they choose a review as well. The same reviewers, they're not reviewing every movie.

Speaker 5:          01:24:00       Are they? Is there like an an industry and reviewing things? Well, what if you look at say like, let's see what movies come out. Sausage party right now. Look at the who's reviewed that movie? TheN look at a movie that's also opening this friday. See how many of those reviewers are the same? They're not the same reviewers. One the time. One hundred percent. Many people reviewing a movie on rotten tomatoes, like when they give those tomato numbers, how many people are doing that? We thousands. No, they only. Well, they have user reviews and then they have like professional reviewers, 85, 74 reviews. Right, right. Wait a minute. Oh, this is a critic's consensus. Yes. And the minute it wasn't always that way. Yes. And separated through critics and then use the reviews and there's been like a separate icon that you're supposed to pay attention. I was just gO to the app.

Speaker 5:          01:24:53       Right. And then if you scroll down now if you scroll down, they have lights. Actually yelp go to the yelp app. But I'm good at rotten tomatoes was even have an app. Do they make that up? yeah, they did. But then they have like the reverse. And then a lot of these reviewers, there's somebody that actually chooses if it's rotten or not. I clicked on a few of these, uh, like what they're called fresh reviews where it's supposed to be positive review and then they go through it. You're like, how did they get positive from this? This sounds like they were kind of on the fence, like a 50 slash 50 percent, you know? But then it's like all, none of it makes real sense. There's no real math on this at all. It's it's, it's pretty bullshit because there's been a few interesting that you Just pointed that out.

Speaker 5:          01:25:34       Yeah. It's interestinG that that's critics. Yeah. I really thought that the whole purpose of those things was reviewers being regular peopLe. Yeah. If you look at it like a site like metacritic, that seems like it's a little bit less bias and a more faCtual and that makes more sense because there's been so many movies on your lately. I've been like, That's impossible that that's a 90 percent. Yeah, because you could, if you had a movie, you could just use these guys. Take them to business. Lunch plank length, a credit card. I just went to their website and they're owned by cbs interactive. Nevermind. God it. I had no idea that that's interact. If you motherfuckers that's viacom were buttons sold. Ladies and gentlemen look like, look at this now. If you go to this one and look at the same movies like sausage party or whatever it is, it won't match up. Shouldn't they match up? If they both do the exact same fucking thing in their own farm, the same company. Oh, I hate life. That owned by the same company. One of them is owned by cbs. The other one is owned by universal. Right. But yet notice how many. How many reviewers on this one compared to how many reviewers on the one that's universal with sony universal work together if not owned by the same company. Right. How many different. What is the. Was the numbers for metacritic?

Speaker 4:          01:26:51       Seventy four versus would've met a critical

Speaker 5:          01:27:01       less. Yeah. This is for critic reviews. They have 27, six, 30, 34 or so, just 34. So my folks, we had to get medicated. So metacritic is not the same pool as rotten tomatoes where all these extra reviewers coming from. Rotten tomatoes on a movie that you guys are a bunch of people that are, you know, look, if you had, let's say there's a network, right? Like okay, there's a network of podcasters, right? We're all kind of whether or not we're networked together

Speaker 4:          01:27:32       officially. We're all connected, right? Well, you know, kind of movie reviewer type characters that are like online movie movie reviewer dudes. If they say, hey man, you want to get in with this rotten tomatoes thing, it's really cool. You just, you have to go to seven movies a week and get paid really well and you just write these little things about it and you know, you're encouraged to support the big ones. Just be fair in your criticism. You don't have to make things up if you don't like something, just be fair. Okay, cool. And then you go in there and then you got steady money. You got steady money coming your Way. I don't know how much it is, but I would imagine a company like rotten tomatoes, which you've used, I've used so many people have used to to see a movie. They probably makes a cash, right? Oh yeah. Have to. They have to. Everybody knows it. Yeah. Who doesn't know about rotten tomatoes, right?

Speaker 5:          01:28:18       I mean they advertise movies on rotten tomatoes that they judge that same kind of weird. Well, the problem is even if it was like totally legit in the beginning, right after, which I believe someone that comes along with you, like even the fertittas sold the ufc. Okay. Just be aware lIke it's at a certain point in time, no matter how rich you are, someone comes along with a good number.

Speaker 4:          01:28:41       Okay. Okay. Say, okay, so, uh, we'll still be able to review movies. I can be honest. You can be fair. Can you be fair? I can be fair. have you ever be fair? Let's do this. Let's go on a business level.

Speaker 11:         01:28:54       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:28:55       Exynos chip. Stay.

Speaker 11:         01:28:59       No. Mcdonald's. kayla.

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       We're going to be a business forever. We, we're going to die some day. We're not dying, bro. We're not fucking die and we're going to take hormones and we're going to go to a fucking doctor in Brazil and he's going to shoot us up at the same shit that they shot up. Michelle pfeiffer when she looks perfect, she looks really similar to how she looks in that wolf

Speaker 3:          01:29:22       go math right now. I just saw her in person. The other Is 12. She's 12 years old. She's so small and so tiny person. what's wrong with you that you know, it's so weird. I, I, they really gave me. I got to go to the sausage party premier and I got to be on like the red carpet, all the celebrities and stuff and it was really, it was my first time ever doing something like that level, but I got to see everyone in person that I've always seen like selena gomez and and that. josh, what's that guy's name again? Josh from limitless or Joseph Gordon levitt, george. All these guys that I've seen so many times. They're so small and like in real life, it's so weird seeing them. They seem like little versions of everyone. It's so cool. It's cool and interesting.

Speaker 6:          01:30:00       Well, you're not a big guy. Yeah, my side.

Speaker 3:          01:30:02       Yeah, I know. But you, you think, I guess because you think of them as superheroes, you know, and a lot of these movies and stuff that, that

Speaker 6:          01:30:09       if I had a dollar for every time someone said, you're shorter than I thought you'd be to me, I'd have $100. $100. I'm not kidding. Right. Michael? Sarah, by the way, he was the weirdest guy. Michael. Sarah, who's a kick ass. Is that it's called that guy or no? No. Scott pilgrim. Remember scott pilgrim? Oh yeah. He was weird. Yeah, he. Well, he just looked guys weird. You always. He just has a weird vibe domain. It's like a. It's probably a little uncomfortable. That's why he's funny. Yeah. Hipster like homeless. Hipster. That's what he looked like in the sixties. That dude is so funny. I love that guy. I think that whenever someone's at funny, I always assumed that something going on some kind of crazy. You know? He's that funny. He's a funny fucking guy, man. Absolutely. Kick ass. It's still one of my or not. Not kept pilgrims. Scott pilgrim. Yeah, it's super bad. Super bad is my favorite. It's like that scene when jonah hill's just drawn dixon school. I remember I was literally like lie. I watched it by myself and I was lying sideways on my couch kicking and paddling in the air, like drawing, like why you keep drawing? That's something I would totally have done. I still do it. To this day, half the nopa. This has no. David choe, Whatever david chosen here. He's drawing dicks. Yeah, I love that. He's got all different colored tags.

Speaker 6:          01:31:36       So perfect. Dick's, dick's, boobs and eyeballs were my three. Was it jonah hill that did it? It wasn't him. It was jonah hill. God, it's so fucking funny, man. So jonah hill? Yep. Cool. Sausage party. Funny. Be honest. Don't rotten tomatoes falling out. I'll tell you the tell you the

Speaker 3:          01:31:54       full truth. I've been waiting for this movie for a long ass time because it's kind of like a dream movie, a pixar movie and having a dirty, like an old fritz, the cat or something. Right. And you know, there's a couple of scenes in there that kind of our fun, very, very fun to watch. But overall it just, it was just like having a kids movie where they cussed at and it was like, you know, really kind of like, oh god, oh jeez. Oh my. I got bored. That was the biggest thing. I just got really bored while watching it and I was not expecting. I was expecting that to be the best way to get tattoo of it on my arm or something, but no, it was, it was one of the biggest letdowns I've ever had and the rotten tomatoes, that's called reality. Internet's coming for your son and I love seth rogen movies. That's my favorites. Like, like if there was a Class of movie, if seth rogen movies are my top favorite, but it just didn't like it was cheesy, like they called the juice juice and there's like all these like things Where you're just like, oh god. It's like open mic night.

Speaker 6:          01:32:47       Oh man. Brian coming down hard on the sausage party. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:32:53       I mean I, I really, maybe I was just a little bit of a correction. Maybe I waS just in the mood. I will definitely watch it again and see if it. It seemed like a kids movie where they cussed and it's pretty much like if I'm going to do the first or like a new version of like an adult cartoon I'm going to show or nudity, I'm going to get that nc 17 rating. I don't get on underrating. I'm going, I'm going deep. Okay. You know, but you know, that's not what they were trying to do. I mean, they, they do it in movie. Spoiler alert. You don't, don't, don't, don't. I'll change it. Then the movie ends very graphic.

Speaker 6:          01:33:31       Does it end. Is graphic is like team America world police when they're fucking.

Speaker 3:          01:33:35       It goes over it. But imagine if it was made for cinemax.

Speaker 6:          01:33:40       Oh, okay. I've seen nipple, but no, no lips. These are all just pieces of lettuce and tacos and stuff. Oh, there's, that's what I'm saying. They should have. Don't say anymore. You've already confused me enough where I can forget what you said and you just cross it off to you being you. Right. But no, I mean it's unfortunate. You know what man? It's. Did you see ghostbusters? Fuck no. Okay. Here's, here's my thinking. Did you? Yes, I did. God, my girls want to see it. All right. It's perfect movie for her year old girl. It's a perfect movie for an eight year old girl. That's my review. Had she seen the original kind of scary. She doesn't have to. Here's the thing about. Here's the thing about watching ghostbusters in new form, if the original didn't exist, it's kind of a fun movie. It's stupid. There's some giant leaps. There's some. There's some kind of clunky writing, but there's also some funny shit. There's some funny moment I heard it was all man hating and ends with not all man hating, but definitely a lot of man hating. There was definitely every move. Every dude in the movie was a dork, but it's not the only one who was really unbelievable that. Well, like literally wasn't believable. Was chris hemsworth the guy? Yeah, it was awesome. It was really good. I heard it was awesome. It was really funny, but he's

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       so stupid in the movie that it's unbelievable and these girls are like constantly enamored with him in love with them, but they can't believe how dumb he is and that's like sort of this running gag to the point where it's almost ridiculous. But here's what I think. I think if that bothers you, what kind of a bitch are you like that's really bothering you? That these women are shitting on men to the point where they're taking chris hemsworth and they're making them dumb kit at all. The dumb bitches that had been in movies. Can't we have one movie where these three, you know, not so good looking girls take over the fucking world and, and save everybody and, and have the dudes be all fucked up looking or a or a mass or crazy or chris hemsworth and chris hemsworth was perfect and beautiful. Also like the dumbest human being that's ever walked the face of the planet and an actor showing his head shots like the whole deal.

Speaker 1:          01:35:51       You like super cliche. So I never go to the movies anymore because of the problem I'm having with things like ghostbusters though and stuff where the hype doesn't live up to the movie. The movie sucks so bad. I can't believe I didn't have to suck. That was my point. Yeah. It didn't have to suck, but like there was some funny shit in the movie. I don't want to give away any parts of it. Were there, there was some like clever turns in the beginning of the movie where I laughed. I was like, this, this is funny. This is funny, and I thought of myself. I was trying to watch that movie saying, if I saw this movie without having known about the first movie, what would I think about it? Especially because I'm taking my kids. Right? It's a good movie to take kids to.

Speaker 1:          01:36:26       It's fun. Silly. It's kind of scary, like whoa, but it's obviously really fake, but it's. It wasn't that bad. It wasn't a point where anybody would get mad. The only reason why anybody got mad is because it's a redo of the original ghostbusters and it's all women instead of all men. Everybody got fucking terrified or angry or frustrated or pissed or who's fucking social justice warriors. My thought is who gives a fuck? Like is that really a concern that they've decided to try to make money by reducing ghostbusters with chicks? Like isn't that an obvious thing? I thought, I thought. I think the biggest concern for me lately with movies is the stories aren't there. We're just looking at so much cgi and tricks that they need to really think about like, holy shit, what the fuck was the plot of this movie? Will that was ghostbusters?

Speaker 1:          01:37:14       Yeah, definitely. There was definitely part of that. There was also some really clunky writing there. Something like that, like with the point where yoU saw them in some scenes early on. They're really fun and unexpected and light fun kind of scenes like, this is kind of fun. This movie's kind of fucking weird. It's like it's not a bad movie, and then you're like, oh, but it's kinda bad. Here we. This part's kind of bad. It's all like a bunch of different movies. It's not like if you go back and watch like a pick a classic movie, like if you go Watch the outlaw josey wales, the outlaw josey wales is the outlaw josey wales froM minute one to the time of the end of the movie. It doesn't vary in the way it feels. It feels like the outlaw josey wales. It's a beautiful work of art.

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       It's seamless iN its production, like the way it portrays everything is the same through the whole movie and it builds up and it makes you feel like you're really engrossed in, gripped in it. ThiS movie didn't do that. This ghostbusters movie would take you in and pull you away and take you to push you away from it. It was like, it would be so clunky at tiMes. You'd be like, what? Like this is the same movie that did that youtube thing earlier. That was so hilarious. Is the same movie. How did, how did, how did this get through? Did you guys just who, who gave you? Did you guys get shitty notes? Like what happened? I want to know what happened cause like if that goes buster Movie came out and it was all checks but it was fucking bang and just hold clarius like what is that movie that all the girls love that? I haven't seen it.

Speaker 5:          01:38:39       The hilarious bridesmaids and something bad. Bad mom. No, that's a new one. There's an old one. Something bridesmaids that kristen wiggs in it too. Yes. That movie's supposed to be fucking hilarious. I have not seen it, but like a lot of people that have seen it that I respect as comedians have said, do that movie is fucking hilarious. I think berman is god. I might just put words in his mouth. Maybe it was joy. Did you see this? The neW independence? Of course not. Fuck that. Of course not. How long does that last awful. When I saw. How long did that last? The movie theater. Oh, a day at least. I mean it has to last at least a week or two

Speaker 4:          01:39:15       spoken independence day enough. Capital e, dash nef.

Speaker 5:          01:39:23       It's weird because I buy movies on itunes now. You know, like I instead of like when it's not on netflix and hulu, I'd rather spend 10 bucks and buy it on itunes, then go to a movie and spend 50, you know, on everything. So I buy a lot of movies now in so many movies that I'm like, I've heard nothing but good things about this. Maybe I'm like, god damn, I wasted 10 buCks on that fucking like what? Give me an example. Oh fuck you like 10 cloverfield lane. No, I haven't seen that, but I, that's one of the ones. I'm not a problem. I'll be about to endorse it and recommend it to you, but I hate it. some people hated it. Did you sit iN the theater? No. So at home, do you like seeing movies in the theater or action movies specifically? Do you think that's important to see them there versus at home? Unless your p digitally. I mean like when you got some gigantic ass fucking house with a movie theater and it, you're not going to get the same effect of the sound.

Speaker 4:          01:40:18       I think the when when someone is a composer, like let's take for example, like certain movies that have amazing soundtracks and like you hear things happening behind you. Like The most recent star wars movie soundtrack was incredible and like this, all these, there's all this shit going on. It's part of the experience. You'll wash this giant ass fucking screen. It'S beautiful. Crystal clear. The sound is incredible. Literally feels like it's coming from everywhere in the room. You can't reproduce that at home. so in that case, I think that yeah, for some kinds

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       of movies watching it in a movie theater is. But how about a country with no country, no country for old men that's totally unnecessary.

Speaker 5:          01:41:03       Watch that movie in the movie theater, we don't need to require that. That's. It's not a big sound movie though to sound is required and whatnot. But like it's not. There's no big sound elements in it. Right? It's awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:41:12       Some movie that might be better if you absorb it by yourself, you don't want to be influenced by anybody because it's such a movie that makes you think so much. Like even the end of it, the individual sort of a, I don't want to give it away, but it's a very strange ending, but it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. But it's one of those movies where as you're watching it, you're like in gripped, you're just, it's, it takes you to this place and you don't want to be distracted in any way when you're dealing with this. Like it's not doing anything you expected to do. It's doing all sorts of weird shit. Like it's a, it's very different than a lot of movies and a lot of movies that have this very specific formula that even if they get creative inside that formula, they still stick to the formula and the good guy wins in the end and all that stuff happened.

Speaker 1:          01:41:54       This movie is not like that at all. None. No country for old men took me like a couple of years to really appreciate what it was all about because I saw it. I was like, god, they acting is so good. The story so compelling. But what is, what is missing in this thing? Well, it's missing this. It's not tidy. It's like this just spectacular work of drama. So much shit going on. It just leaves you with this feeling of whoa at the end of it, you know? And I think that, you know, movies like that, that's a, that's a rare accomplishment to like they. I mean it's, it's sort of like what we're talking about, Michael Phelps being so incredible. It's something that everybody could do. Like it's, there's, there's all kinds of movies that are awesome, and then every now and then you get a movie that makes you go, whoa, I got complete. redefiner are

Speaker 5:          01:42:44       super rare, but when it happens, when you hear that, the last five that aren't that like, here's the last five I bought, that sucked and everyone told me it was an amazing movie inside out, which is a pixar movie. Loved it. Wow. Dora kidS loved it. I read stories to them every night and modulated. Gosh, you liked it. So you liked that. Shut down my body's testosterone adapters. And I sit in this seat as a daddy and shit. I live my life through a. How dare you, how dare you mock him while he cries in albuquerque. Um, and uh, while, uh, you know, enjoy it from their eyes. They enjoy it. They think it's a legacy. I hang out with a six year old that you love dearly child that you know, for kids. I agree 100 percent definitely. But if it was by myself and go, shut the stupid fucking shit off. Yeah, the worst I like, I have a theory that if you're on for you, if you're on depression medicine, it's like the best movie ever, and I've heard people saying, I've cried five times in that movie as the kid. You might cry. Yeah. Uh, another one in a million ways to die in the west west. One of the worst piles of shit

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       I've ever seen in my life. Set mcfarland's movie where he's in the west and a seth macfarlane family guy. He made a movie. Yeah. Is he the actor? Everyone told me that was great and I fucking hated it. Oh, I know they're setting the toP 10 posts. Either it could wreck your brain and start thinking, man, fuck cartoons. I'm ready to sling this dick in front of the camera. Says he's too smart. He's too much of a bad motherfucker. Seth macfarlane number and his ass the night before, the night before. What's that? Everyone told me that was a great movie. I haven't heard of that. It's a seth macfarlane. Maybe that I forgot. I bought that. It was really horrible, but that's the main.

Speaker 1:          01:44:36       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:44:38       girl, she's hot. Charlie's, they're wrong. No, that's not a the wrong what's going on with her face. That's not real photoshop poster a little bit. So why would they do that? You take one of the most beautiful women in the world

Speaker 1:          01:44:51       and you alter her to make her look like some modern day playmate.

Speaker 6:          01:44:56       That's so stupid. That wasn't eric. That's deciphered. Oh, okay. Well there you go, bitch. Take that back. There she goes, charlene.

Speaker 1:          01:45:06       Yeah. Come on man. That can't really be at 33 percent rotten tomatoes. Somewhat dated payday payday bills. Why tomatoes needs that paper,

Speaker 6:          01:45:18       ted to speak. If you want more than 33. well, you know, we thought we could have business swatch. We'll have a trach rotten tomatoes.

Speaker 1:          01:45:28       Turn into a gangster from new jack city titties. Have a meeTing, a business meeting. I put it on my platinum card. Now you'd have a black card if you're a real ball. You okay?

Speaker 6:          01:45:40       Black card? Yeah, but she had a black card. I think it'd be cool if When my sister comes over and her fucking husband starts bragging about his business, he pull all your black card. Bb back card. You know, it's a good maybe for kids, so I think it's one of my favorite animated ones are not the zootopia. I think he's like, I'm seth motherfucking macfarlane. I don't need a goddamn black card. Okay. Are you like a regular car? It's ironic. I have a flip flip phone. I drive a mini cooper seth macfarlane. I made the valet guy. You bet that. How much success is that guy? He's great. I like him. He is an awesome. I met him. He's a super busy high times of words. I've met him twice. That was a, I don't know. I don't think we met him then. Dude. Yeah, I think we met. Um, seth rogen. do you? You're with seth rogen? Yeah. I met seth mcfarland at his place because I did a voice, like a fear factor voice on one of the shows. I wasn't american dad, I think. Yes. But he's a super

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       nice guy. Super nice guy. He's like, he, he's laughing. He goes, we just smoked pot and come up with funny shit. If that was his, like he was like super easy to get along with, like really friendly. I did the thing for them. I said, thanks man, I'm really nice to meet you. Like super friendly and nice, and I was like, wow, that's cool to you know, a lot of times you meet these super genius characters. They're awkward and yellow. Don't make this guy annoyed, you know, here's what I'm. Some super genius guy that created some sitcom, try to be nice to them. I don't know, you don't know what you're dealing with. But like so far I've met a lot of those guys that some of them work on like paul centers and one of the first guy that ever, like there was a guy produced news radio, the first guy to give me like my big break in hollywood.

Speaker 1:          01:47:33       He when I met the first time I met him. Like this guy is like way too smart and way too weird. Like I don't want to piss him off because I want this job. Like I don't even know what to say. This dude, you know, there's a certain like super genius type characters like show runner type dudes. They're notoriously like powerful figures. Like who's that guy that like charlie sheen got into it with that was a sitcom creator. What does that dude's name? Chuck lorre. Yes. That guy is the mac daddy of those shows like no one has run more of those fucking gigantic smash. Super $100, million billion dollar hits. Then that guy who sounds lIke a handsome person. Well, he's just a. He just knows how to do those kind of shows. You know, like he's a guy who's figured out like a frequency. He's figured out.

Speaker 1:          01:48:20       He's gotten more shit. Really? Yeah. two and a half men and greg. Civil grace under fire. Big bang theory mom for an eastern. What? The fucks for anything since 1992. What he was learning, he was learning grace unDer fire was a big one. There was a crazy rumor that I. I can't really talk about too much about brett butler from grace under fire at the cool guy in the top left. What's his face telling nigger on? He died recently. Oh, did, that's right. He was a super nice guy telling negroland came up to me after one of my sets one night and was like, uh, like one of the, one of the nicest compliments, but also like really honest and, and curious. Like we had like a reallY cool conversation. I was like, this is the least hollywood conversation between two men that do the same business in hollywood ever.

Speaker 1:          01:49:09       He was like super honest about like subject matter. We were talking about like, um, um, like he, he said that he's always wondered like what should we talk about on stage? And he's sometimes he's confined himself. He was saying that he wondered or worried whether or not the audience would appreciate his own. The things that he thought were interesting. So instead he was writing and talking about stuff that he thought that they would think would be interesting and that he was trying to change that. So we had this really interesting talk about it, but he died really suddenly have like a weird disease I think. What age, age, not that old man to look up. Taylor negron liver cancer. He'd passed away january of last year. How old was he? FIfty seven. If I can hang in there 10 years. We got that 10 years from now to 10 years is quick.

Speaker 1:          01:50:04       Summer fucking came and went so fast and it's not even over yet. What the fuck happened? This summer was august 11. It's fucking flying. I refuse to believe that time is the same every day. I refuse to believe I don't give a fuck about your watches. I don't care about your quartz movements. I don't care about your atomic clock. I think it's moving faster. I agree. One hundred percent. I would have bet anything on it. It makes zero sense. let's all bet. $5. Okay. Since you said he'd bet everything on it. I'm putting you money on the table, fella. All right, let's go to the carpet. Tell us the answer. Jamie. Times moving faster. One of the things that I was. I was watching this thing on on planets and about the expansion of the universe and not only the expansion, but the fact that it's accelerating. It's moving apart faster and faster and that they dIdn't know this 20 years ago and I was listening to this guy speak about it and I remember thinking to myself like, that is so crazy, like that is a huge factor in our existence that this universe is not just static but it's moving away and it's accelerating in some sort of strange way and that they can measure it when they measure it over 10 or 20 years is a measurable number that allows them to discern like, okay, we were positive that this thing is not just moving but accelerating and this is our universe and they just figured that out 20 years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:51:33       like we're just waking up. It's like we're on a starship and we're flying through the university. We just came out of hyperspace and we're all like, okay, where are we going? What is, what's, what is this? Okay? Does anybody have a manual? Here's the manual. We're going to go look through the shit that the old people wrote down. We literally are exactly the same thing. Like we get taught by people who get taught by people who get taught by people who are basically monkeys, you know, it was like, this is like a few chains away from us and dudes with sticks trying to kill giraffes and shit. There's not that many. If you Go back in time like numbers, you wouldn't get Like 20, 30 times and then you're in the caveman era. That shit is not that far ago, man. It's not that far ago. So we're like waking up in the middle of like this trip, this whole galaxy hurling through the universe going a thousand miles an hour and a circle flying around a huge nuclear explosion a million times bigger than it just flying through the universe and we're waking up and we're going, what about gay marriage? Fuck that. Not on my watch, bro. Okay, okay. Okay. What do you think about taxes? WeLl, we need to revamp the entire tax rates and we did russell's book and you'll get to where your powdered wig and

Speaker 6:          01:52:46       meanwhile flying through infinity and we just realizing it. We're just like, oh, we're not. Not only is the son not the center of the universe, not only is the earth not the center of the universe, but this galaxy is just one of hundreds of billions. There's untold numbers. Not only that, but inside each galaxy is a supermassive black hole that's one half of one percent of the mass of the entire galaxy, and if you go through that, there might be an unlimited number of universes. How the planetS are lined up. Right now we're getting some sweet pitchers from mars. Have you seen those? Dude, that one. What else I've seen mad about you, chuck lorre knocking it out of the park, making, making cash. He's got a tube right at Thailand, has a tube and he presses a green light and the hotness, young prostitute you've ever seen in your life goes through that.

Speaker 6:          01:53:38       This is not true. That's totally sheen. I got confused. Charlie sheen would do that. Charlie sheen probably did. That was two and a half men money. He's almost out of money. Supposedly. He's almost spent the last amount of money. That's not true. I heard it. I Just read that he's like really hurting, like he's cutting this money up from his ex wife. Like he used to give her so much money around. Cut it all off. Oh no. I mean, well he is a, he's got hiv and he does a lot of drugs. Those are not good things to have together. I mean like everybody was on his side when that whole thing went down with that chuck lorre guy that chuck lorre guys like this. He's a real simple man. Money iS tight. I can't pay ridiculous child support. Well, that might be a tmz headline by the way.

Speaker 6:          01:54:24       Fifty $5,000 a month. Wow. Wonderful. Charlie had been raking in six, 13 a month just from his cut of two and a half men profits. Wow. Six hundred. $13,000 a month. Gotcha much. I recently had a sell those rights for a lump sum of 26 million. Seven hundred $50,000. He is suffering. That is a smile pittance for a man of his esteem to live off. First of all, how dare they, how dare they only give him $26 million. He doesn'T say what happened to the stash. Charlie says he now averages $87,000 a month and last month got a relatively paltry $6,261. He says he now can't keep up because his monthly expenses total $105,000 and $25,000 for healthcare expenses not covered by any insurance. Twenty $5,000 a month for healthcare expenses. Is that what you call your drug dealer? Oh, allegedly. Allegedly. Maybe he's just got a fucking Michael Jackson type dude.

Speaker 6:          01:55:34       Put them to sleep at night. Just every lease amount by Michael Jackson. Dude, that dude slipped. I ain't going to slip baby. I got your back on my hold. You. I'm going to be with you. I'm going to put you under every night. Different shit. I got different shit. The shit did michael jackson's doctorate use. It was a good idea. In theory. Here's why it doesn't work in practice. It doesn't allow you to go to heavy rem sleep. My stuff does. Okay. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you to the. I'm going to drop you out of the alpha spate into beta state and then you go and you're like, okay. Okay. Okay, cool. Cool. I'm charlie cina. Look, I'd love to talk to you, But there's a fucking, uh, a bowling ball bag filled with coke and five strippers and the other room I kind of go to work.

Speaker 6:          01:56:09       If you could guess a nuMber, how many people do you think are being put to sleep? Not daily, but like semi daily or we did that way to, to two a day. RIght? Like thousands of people. 100 people need heavy sedation by maybe a dog. There's a lot. There's a lot. I know several people that are really nice, folks that need adderall, not adderall. Ambien to go to bed meet you. They're not drug addicts. They work jobs that are very stressful. they have a very nice families. there's nothing wrong with them. Do you notice they love that stuff? Do you know? It's mostly women though. I find that, yeah. really? I know it seems like every girl I know either is taking over the counter, like what's the stuff that's in a good on it stuff? New mood. Five htp. Yeah. No, no. The one that makes a trip trip to law or they're taking, they're supposed to make you relax.

Speaker 6:          01:57:03       Uh, but everyone, every girl I know it has something to help her sleep almost, you know, consider what you just said. first of all, I know those are hanging around and slip this on grazing and it a bad. Anybody be crazy. We need everybody. It's like that song it takes to put sleeping issues just seems really big. Yeah. But you're dealing with a very biased study group. Oh yeah. I know. Yeah. Some people sleep like babies bro. They can't wait to sleep, but no guys. Alright. Yeah. I don't take, I've never taken a sleeping pill. I know guys. Yeah. It's weird when you don't have like regular life job. Yeah, true. And I just pretty much go to sleep when I go to sleep now. Yeah. I know guys with a lot of serious obligations that oftentimes will work 10 to 12 hours a day all the time.

Speaker 6:          01:57:51       Like I have a good buddy of mine, he needs it. He works 10, 12 hours a day. He has hIs own business and he's always working and he's fucking exhausted and sometimes he's like, ah, what about the accounts and what about this and that, and he'll take an ambient and pop off and I feel like now all I have to do is just eat and I'll fall asleep for like, I don't know what it means. Like last night I had chicken wings and I fell asleep like men child. Do you know about their child's brian? No. I mean it's like I don't understand these people like I guess we have jobs and they don't sleep. Whatever funnel I could sleep, I don't get it. Food does not gIve me energy. It just makes me sleepy. Well, it does, but It also robs you of resources. It's really not a good idea to eat a lot of food before you go to bed because a lot of times you bought body starts digesting that food

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       and it uses up resources which you should go to bed. You shouldn't be hungry, but there should be some time between when you eat and when you go to bed, allow your body to them food so that your body can adequately go into the many stages that it requires to really rebuild your system.

Speaker 5:          01:58:58       I'm going to feel like I eat now. I'll fall asleep like I'll be like. I know, but I'm just saying like it's not the smartest thing to do.

Speaker 4:          01:59:05       Gets sleepy after they eat a lot, but it's really not the right the right thing to do. the right thing to do, especially if you eat anything heavy carbs, bro. Science coming up, strap strap in for brown science, allegedly the spike in insulin that you get from taking in all those. If you like pizza, you have like a whole pizza to yourself. It's like you're late night life anD we're all laughing and stoned and we all ordered five pizzas. That's not good.

Speaker 5:          01:59:34       Good. I like it. Might be good for those 20 minutes while you're eating that pizza. I'm saying if I have soup, if I just have some like chicken soup. Lying, wendy's double double. I love soup. I do to say soup soup is one of my favorite blues blueprint number, bro. My. It's great because my girlfriend is like a huge cooker and so I just have to tell her what I call the chef. Yeah, but she can say cooker, cook or something. You throw food in. She's a crock pot, but she's like, I got this white bean soup that my mom used to make. It was like a midwest trash type thing where it's like, you know the one with the white beans and it's a little thicker. Like a chilean has like bacon or ham in it and it's so good. My mom sent me her recipe and she cooked a bunch of it, but I eat almost the whole thing of soup. Yeah. My mom used to make split pea soup with ham. God damn. That was good. Split split. Split pea soup is not bad for you unless you're a pig that's really bad for you. Either you're on the menu, they're like split pea, it sounds like. Oh, what a wonderful dish. It's organic. It's vegetable based. Not so much

Speaker 4:          02:00:47       bitch. There's actually a smoked out dead pig inside of that thing in the. You have to have the bone. If you do it correctly.

Speaker 5:          02:00:55       He supposed to cook it with the ham hock on the internet. This piece of bacon with a nipple still attached to it. It's not real. It is real. It is 100 percent real boiled pork belly. So. Well, that's what baking in. Well, let me explain to you what bacon

Speaker 4:          02:01:12       is because if you don't know because I didn't know until a couple of years ago. Oh, bacon. Is this part of the pig? The bottom half a pig. This is one of the reasons whY bacon doesn't really exist on wild boars. Like, uh, I've only shot one wild pig and they don't have any bacon. MaN. They're out there hustling. They're a different animal. It's, it doesn't look the same either. I mean, I shot a pretty big one. It was pretty well fed, but their

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       uh, their, their skin, their flesh is not pink or white, like a, you know, you know, it was always pork. The other white meat, it's not supposed to be white because they're out there eating egg corns and ground nesting birds and all the stuff that like, they're, they're not herbivores either. Those things are omnivores. TheY eat, they eat fucking everything district. There's this picture that I tweeted a few months back of a boar running away with a font in its mouth, like a small deer and its mouth and a lot of people were like, whoa. I did not know. They eat babies, they'll eat a deer, they fucking eat your cat. They'll eat your dog deli everything. They'll you to you fuck an. Apparently every year someone falls into a pen with pigs on a farm and gets jacked. Look at this pig running off with his deer and it's mal.

Speaker 1:          02:02:30       How yo, that's dark. Do you see that? Speaking of pigs in derek, did you see that cop shooting the deer video? Yeah, that's fucked up man. I did a shot right in the head is so stupid. It's so stupid. And he, you know, it was really callous. Yeah, that was brutal. Well, I think, yeah, it was really callous, man. It was weird. I guess he had to do it though. I think that's what they said. They said, do you have to shoot it? I think he asked someone what to do and I think they said put it down. So I mean, if you're going to put it Down the way he did it, even though it looked crazy because he did it in front of everybody with the way he did, it was the best way to do it, honestly. Shoeing. HeRe's the thing. I mean, I don't know what they're going to do with the body.

Speaker 1:          02:03:14       I would hope, hope they give that meet to hunters for the hungry. There is a program that's an America where hunters like say if you, uh, you come over here to experience like the midwest of the United States, like Iowa in particular, um, um, Kansas. A lot of these areas are famous all across the world for having these gigantic white tail deer and it becomes a thing like white tail deer in the midwest of the United States. This is something I've only found out over the last few years, obviously of me getting interested in hunting, but white tail deer hunting, like people hear about it from scotland and they want to come over here. People hear about it from China. They want to come over here. They want to experience what it's like to to hunt white tail deer in Iowa. It becomes like this thing and sometimes people from other places that don't live in Iowa will, they'll, they'll, they'll put in tags and they'll put in tags over and over and over and over and over and over and over and finally they get one and they can go there and they can experience what it's like and then they can't bring the meat back to China or Australia.

Speaker 1:          02:04:22       They can't, they won't let you. Like if you try to fly with a dead deer from the United States and flying into Australia, they'd be like, fuck you. Fuck you, you can't take a chance and going across the fucking ocean, it's really funny because if you go from Nevada to like Ohio,

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       they're like, okay, what do you got in there? Oh, I shot A deer. Congratulations. but he can't fly across water.

Speaker 5:          02:04:44       We're going to cross water.

Speaker 4:          02:04:46       It's very tricky. Even if you try to bring an animal down from Canada into the United States. Well, I mean I'm talking about a dead animal, you know, you're trying to bring a dead animal. It's um, sO it's, it's one of those things Where it, uh, like these people donate money or do they donate food? So if they come over here and they want experience, if they're a hunter from Australia, they want to experience what it's like to hunt in Iowa. They can donate money or In the sense of they can donate food rather to a, like a lot of hungry people. Like if you shoot a 200 pound white tail deer that's gonna feed, that's going to be more than probably in the neighborhood of 150 meals. That's amazing. You can, you can give that away to all these people that need it. You know, if you're from some other place.

Speaker 5:          02:05:38       This particular. I thought I recognize this when I saw the video. Apparently this video is from 2013. This is like two and a half years old. This is not a new thing. It just happened to be. We don't care if it's three years old. This is old shit. This is the one that's going around from yesterday. I saw it says also that the deer was believed to be injured and what's going to pretend a harm motorist if they try to shoo it away, which is why they hit by a car. It could have been hit by a car

Speaker 4:          02:06:06       also. Just could be on the way out. Yeah, I mean that was a pretty big deer. It could be on the way out. It could have been shot by an arrow or a bullet. You know? Somebody could have wounded it.

Speaker 5:          02:06:15       Do you see the deer and the bear video? What are you doing? Jamie? Quake champions. What are you trying to do? Oh, jamie tried to use subliminal messages on with jamie. Tried to do just now what they used to do in the old days with the movies. Hungry. Eat popcorn. Running. Chasing this. Yes. Quake champions debut gameplay trailer. Okay, let me wipe my hands. Dry. Breathe. Oh my god. Look at the graphics shit.

Speaker 12:         02:06:51       Oh, so awesome. Holy shit. Wow. Pure, pure, pure. That's

Speaker 1:          02:07:42       to be a super dork. To know what fds is. Frames

Speaker 12:         02:07:45       for a second. That was an old hold

Speaker 1:          02:07:46       rocket arena map did. They were just playing on. That's what a dork I am. I know that map. The last map. That was an old map that we used to always play on. I don't remember the map number. There was an old map. They definitely kept the fueled and the look of the game by updated the graphics. I really liked how they stayed true to the original formula. I hope they make it so you can't shut those graphics off. This is why. And people get mad at me. Fuck bro. Motherfucking computer doesn't have good firms. The problem is you're not playing the same game as a person who's seen everything, like it's easier to play. well, I take that back. I support your decision to mute all the graphics, but I think he kinda missing part of the fun. Like when you play, maybe not. Maybe I'm full of shit.

Speaker 1:          02:08:29       Here's why I'm full of shit. Here's why I'm definitely full of shit. I don't give a fuck about those. Walgett looks cool the first time you see it. Right? But what do you really want to do? You want to shoot that fucking dude, that's what I want to do. If I shoot him in a perfectly muted environment where he's the only thing that I can aim at and everything else is like mav. No, no, no tan. Like what's that? What's a white people tan? Would that be if you had a crayon like people 10 trump or trump's not white. It's like an orange garfield and people would get super mad if you're asking for a snow cone with nothing in it and they gave him something to color of trump. Like old man, his shadow leather color shed a leather head today. Shimmy definitely hit his head today.

Speaker 1:          02:09:17       Times spin on tmz. Too long. Did it jokes folks? No, no bullying. Relax. Everybody relax. Relax. Don't do. Um, what if you have a computer though? That's so powerful that it doesn't matter if you have the graphics on our night and like the textures. Fuck that textures, you can do it. No, it doesn't change anything. Yeah. But here's the thing. It's not, but it's not about that. It used to be about some people used to like to run it. There's two things going on. One, some people like to run it with the graphics muted because they're video card can handle the frames per second. The required to run it at like high resolution with high frame rates. The higher frame rates make things more smooth. So if you get, they say the human eye can only see 30 frame rates a second. They need to update that. I know for a fact they need to update that because there's, or at least maybe it doesn't apply, I should say, to video games because there's something that happens in video games when it goes from 30 frames per second to 120 frames per second, plus it becomes far smoother and when it's smoother, there's less calculation as far as where that person is at any given time because though your mind

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       can't really say, oh, I see where there's a bunch of frames that are rolling by and that's giving me this illusion of movement and it's all being calculated by a cpu. Your brain doesn't really totally get that, but there's some amount of data that's getting through when something. It's kind of clunky. There's some amount of data that's getting through that, oh, this is not. I just gotta figure out where that thing's going to be, but this, that thing is, it's all like hickey. It's a hiccupy thing. When it gets to 120 frames per second, it's smooth as butter. Then it starts looking like, okay, this is a cartoon. Now I'm watching a cartoon, a cartoon, and smooth, right? A cartoon doesn't have anything to herky jerky stuff to it, and this is like a super smooth cartoon like some of the video games you play like unreal tournament.

Speaker 4:          02:11:21       Remember unreal Tournament, you get into high resolutions and each the screams the players and she the fucking laser beams shooting chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk. It's crazy, right? It's crazy. And high frames per second. It's very smooth. It's really fun and interesting to watch. and when that happens your mind doesn't have to calculate as much because it, it's more predictable. it's like, it's smoother, it's more, uh, it's more pleasing to the eyes, but you're still dealing with all those textures so that you're calculating whether you like it or not or even know it or not. Every Time you pass by some gothic stone wall and there's moss on it, it's amazing looking. your mind either has to deny the existence of that or it has to calculate that into what it's modeled. The world is. So that's extra. It's extra processing power. It's unnecessary. So if the walls were all like the best players, what they would do is they would turn all the textures off so they would only have this like weird, like a tron world, like with tron tron blew a fuse blew and you're in this strange virtual environment or all the walls are flat and matte white.

Speaker 4:          02:12:29       You.

Speaker 6:          02:12:30       Yeah, it's, it's something that I used to have to do just to play in that game on my own. Yeah, my old computer. But I think nowadays though, I think for the most part, like a game like this should probably run pretty perfectly on almost any computer game right here. Has the shadows on. But it has the textures off fine one that has the shadows off too because that happens to some crazy fuckers and what might not be in quake three, which I think that a quick live. But I'm in the older games guys had gotten it down to almost nothing. There was no shadow, there was no nothing. Everything was like this weird artificial environment. If you just started a textures off, just like quick to react, quick to um, shadows off and textures often quick to it might be a hack really. It might not even necessarily be something that I'm now that was in the original settings. I remember it. Was it. Yeah, because it's all based on your graphics card. A lot of graphics cards couldn't handle shadows

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       and stuff like that. Yeah. But also in competition dudes figured out pretty early on that it'd be easier to hit people. There were the only things that you were looking at? Yeah, if I had to play like competitively, I definitely shut everything off. Yeah. Because it'll make you better cheating's just like cutting weight. It's like cutting weight for video games. Did you used to play the old unreal maps? Like the one in the bathroom? We were sitting on top of the paper roll. I played that one. That was unreal. It was cool. It was cool. It was like fans of quake made an awesome game. That's what it was like, you know, and plug. It was cool because didn't we get to see unreal tournament before it even came out? Yeah. We went to the studio. I think it was unreal. It was unreal. It was one of the unreal, eh.

Speaker 5:          02:14:15       One of the unreal releases. I'm trying to remember which one it was the first time we met cliff. Cliff is so normal. He's great. I love cliff and he's. He wouldn't think he'd be like some super genius like video game creator. He seems like such a normal dude. Yeah, totally. Do you know his game by the way, if one of his games just hit itunes called shadow complex, it's one of my favorite games, but now you can a phone, you name it. It's a computer game you get on mac and I think you could do it on the phone too. I just saw it the other day. I'm not sure. What is it? It's a like a side scroller like old school kind of like where where you're figuring out like puzzles and playing like shooting game. there's a game that's out that I just finished the other day.

Speaker 5:          02:15:00       It's one of the best video games I've here. LIfe. That shadow complex remastered. Yeah. Oh, it's this, this cliff. He's new game. That's one of his games that came out a couple of years ago when after he left, uh, I believe, uh, he left epic. dude, I'm so lucky I'm not a teenager today. I'll get this. Bullets are going under water. I would never get anything done. I would get fucking nothing done. I would have never gotten involved in martial arts. Maybe I would've, but I might not have. I might've just done this. God damn. I might've had more fun. Might've been good at twitch then maybe. It just seems so fucking compelling. When you watch these video games today, they're so goddamn compelling. There's this new game that I just finished that you can get for like 20 bucks right now inside. Right. But it's one of the best experiences of video game I've ever had in my life was the graphics.

Speaker 5:          02:15:55       It's, it's like a puzzle kind of games and game where you try to fIgure shit out. But the ending and the fuel of the games is, it's, it's, it's, it's the field of game is some of the, probably the one of the best video games I've ever experienced in my life. And it's really hard. Like there's words brian read. There's super cool. I just played it too. Oh yeah. wow. Whoa, whoa. And it doesn't tell you how to play. There's no real. It's just moving and jumping. Really. You don't really need to. There's no real strange controls. But should we sell nothing off the for anything? And that's when the game. It's not that long to play.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       You can get through in a couple of hours if you're figuring it out, but it'll take you longer if you get stuck. The ending is one of the most beautiful pieces are our masterpieces of video game I've ever seen in my life. Wow. Beautiful. Creepy. Beautiful. Yeah. This is cool to watch. Yeah, it's really fun with shadows. My god. And this isn't even that crazy of graphics. It's, it's just, it's done, right, dude. It's good feeling. Duncan trussell has the oculus rift and he also has the vive. The htc vive and he showed me this archery game the other day and the htc vive and I don't think I can have this in my house. Yeah, you can. No, no, I don't think I can have in the studio here. I don't think I could have it anywhere. I would have. I would have a real problem. I played that fucking archery game until my arms were shaking.

Speaker 1:          02:17:17       You're on the top of a castle and these things are like charging at nacho and shooting at them from the top of the castle. IT's super addictive. Yeah. Did you have a game called quiver? I just pulled this up when I was looking for archery and divide. This looks like he's got a gang of games, but this isn't the one that I played or at least it's not the scene that I played a lot of games, but not good games. Like this is like, like the graphics. This looks like a nintendo 64. The graphics are not the best, but seriously man, you're not going to give a fuck when you were in those goddamn htc vive. Go goggles is the coolest shit in the world. You should get together with dunkin, go to his house, do his a podcast, and, and play the vive. Before you do it, you're going to be blown away.

Speaker 1:          02:18:00       I have the, uh, the, the cheap $30 one that you can buy where you put your samsung phone in and they don't do that. This is the one I played. This is the one I played. Yeah, these motherfuckers just vr archery. You got to shoot at these, um, these balloons. It's fucking real accurate. That's what's crazy. Like you just got to get a feel of which way it's going and how fast it's going. See, like it has a certain amount of frames per second, um, uh, feet per second rather. So the arrow, you have to kind of lead them, like if you know they're jumping, you have to figure out where they're going to be. When the arrows get in there, you know, if they're real close, it's easy, like right there, bam. It's easy. He's right there. But if they're moving, they're moving left to right. You kind of get a judgment. See how this guy is doing that. He's figuring it out. He's leading them. They're moving. Bam. They're running right into the arrows. That's great. That's what I figured out how to do after awhile and that gets super addictive because it's really rewarding because first of all, you don't feel guilty at all because they're not even people. They're just total cartoons. Silhouettes With vikki helmets on and shields, so you don't feel bad. What happened here?

Speaker 1:          02:19:06       Is that the same thing? Is that what happened to the later? Later? yeah. They give you a gun. Hilarious. They're like, you're so good. You realize that it's stupid to have a bow and arrow here. We'll give you a laser. Oh, they give you a laser radar later. Later, later, later, later. The olympics. Right now we're in this for samsung devices. They're in it. Yeah. You could watch the in vr,

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       like look around. Oh wow. Did you change or did you try it? The porn though, the no, I did not. Porn is what was going to choose

Speaker 1:          02:19:36       to. Duncan was too insistent that I do it and I got nervous. I got the fuck out of there. I was Like, you got to relax son. Yeah, make me nervous. You don't want to have a gaga

Speaker 3:          02:19:46       dude. I'm telling you. You got to watch the porn man. I'll sit over here. You won't even see me. He wanted to look at your lips when you were watching it. Girl. He probably snapchat the whole thing while you. You're playing anyways. Did the porn. The porn though really is something that changes everything. Like watching porn and that really like you take it off and you're like, oh no, I felt closer to the girl than I thought I would. That's, that's going to save porn if, if this does catch on.

Speaker 1:          02:20:20       Well maybe because it'll make it too. If they can monetize the htc and the oculus to the point where they can lock down the format. Like the way they have the iphone locked down. Like you can't add anything to the app store unless apple gives you approval if they can control it and that sort of same way. I'm not saying tHat's the best thing for everybody because I kinda liked the idea of open source things. One of the, I use a mac and I use it for convenience and because I'm too busy I got have time to fuck with some window shit, but part of me likes the fact that windows is open and I've heard that argument before, like I've had conversations with people before with like, look, anybody could write shit for windows. You know, it's like you can make products that work on windows, you can make your own laptops, you can put together your own desktops.

Speaker 1:          02:21:05       Like it's, it's a much more open sort of a platform than mac is because mac is the software developer and the hardware developer. The good thing about that is everything works pretty fucking good. Like you get a laptop from apple pretty fucking sure it's gonna work, awesome, etc. And died. What happened? Oh just stop working. But we've had every Fucking computer dies. Windows even, right? They all die. What's my point? My point is a point. If I had a point, it would be that I'm taking it and monetizing the applications that you would use for the htc vive or oculus only makes sense.

Speaker 3:          02:21:45       I thiNk what we're going to see though is, especially when the xbox and the playstation released their vr ca counterpoints, I think that's when it's really going to become an everyday thing and I think it's going to hurt the, the these kinds oF guys like the htcs and the oculus people a lot because I think it's going to be like computer games and then, oh hey, this is an x box. You know, that kind of killed pc gaming a lot and a lot of a lot of ways.

Speaker 1:          02:22:12       I think there's going to be a lot of copyright lawsuits for sure because they're going to have to figure out who. Who invented the critical aspects for like truly immersive virtual reality, like what

Speaker 6:          02:22:26       critical aspects are there? Have they identified them? Who invented those? Because those are huge. You know, if one guy figured out a way to make this, the frame rate's incredibly smooth, so there's no news, no ability to discern when you moving left to right, whether you're moving fast or slow. If one guy wrote some sort of a program or figured out something that I would imagine. I'm not a lawyer obviously, but I'd imagine there'd be some sort of a case for that. Like all these trolls, patent trolls that apple gets hit with all the time. Like I would imagine that that's going to be crazy when it comes to this stuff. Yeah. Unless It's already been licensed, licensed it out, you know, it could be just some old guy going, oh, you'll give me $2,000,000 a year.

Speaker 6:          02:23:05       You might get brian's idea of commerce is an episode or a fucking one of the, uh, back to the future movies where like a delorean and need some plutonium. this guy just happens that I think though, I think, I think next year is when xbox is releasing. There's, I think playstation's coming out this year maybe. Maybe. I don't know. Well, I don't think you can patent virtual reality. I mean, lawnmower man was low as 1992. What year was lawnmower man? fInd that? Let's guess. I would guess 1994. Ninety four. Ninety five. I say nine. Two, nine, two, one. Oh, by the way, complete total guests. I had no idea it was right. Okay. But total recall is also a virtual reality movie. We watched the running man. Oh, that's terrible. Horrible. That did not have your childhood. I'm telling you. people were stupid as fuck back when we were kids.

Speaker 6:          02:24:04       We didn't realize how dumb we were until we watch old movies. Was it was 1990 for a total recall. Nineteen 90. Interesting. Even earlier. Um, so those are those. Those are vIrtual reality movies. So it's not like virtual reality is like some thing that someone invented. It's really like a hope and a dream. It's no waste to send a desert. It's like everybody who lives a shitbag life is hoping there's gotta be some way that I can be superman told her recall wasn't technically a virtual reality is false memories being implanted in your brain strain. That's why he's being danger days. That's true, but it's kind of that reality is kind of virtual. It's creating an artificial memory. no, you're totally right. it was an artificial memory movie. Yeah. Strange days was a virtual reality movie, but there's been a few others. RIght. There's been a few others. But um, what do you think with the. Was the big one? What's the biggest one? Virtual reality movie matrix. The matrix. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Right? I don't even think of that. Yeah, that's the biggest. So like, I don't think anybody come along and say they invented virtual reality, like that's sort of like a whole. It's like a horn blowing in the distance that we all knew it was coming and it's not even like if even if you look at video games, you can say video games are virtual reality.

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       Just very bad versIons of him, you know, like, like super mario brothers. That's a virtual reality of a plumber. What is this virtual reality is coming to your movie theater near you ends. I've heard a lot of people talk about this as a pretty cool movie. I don't think I've ever seen or heard of 1999. I think jude law's in it. That's a name of a boner pill. Jennifer. Jason leigh. Mmm. I don't know. I can't speak on it, but I've heard a lot of people said that it was like an under the radar kind of good movie came out in 1999, which is the same year. the matrix came out probably. Why no one heard about it.

Speaker 1:          02:25:55       Huh? It's supposed to be a good mom is a three and a half stars is that three and a quarter stars for three and a half to eight. A 71 fucking rotten tomatoes star search. We covered in empire of allies.

Speaker 8:          02:26:09       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:26:10       maybe. Maybe the corporation realizes the benefit isn't telling the truth. THe way to make the money is not to create bad reviews are fake reviews. The money is in being brutally honest and reaping the rewards of people coming to read these really country review.

Speaker 5:          02:26:33       That's why I get my news and information from only hashtags nowadays. Oh, that's good marriage. You do that like every time there's any helicopter in burbank. I'm like hashtag burbank and like, what's going on? This is what I do every morning when I wake up, I go hashtag apocalypse. See what's the most recent post I'm going to go back to sleep. I go outside and shoot my rubber elk. It's more Fast. Inaccurate though. It's usually one guy going dude or the helicopter down on the street. Well, there's definitely some shit

Speaker 1:          02:26:59       going down in these. Like if you follow like social media news feeds, like people that are on the scene, they're talking about some cops shooting some kid or something like that. I mean that's one of the best ways to get some data. The question is the veracity of the data, like whether or not it's god damn, I sound like a professor. I need to apply for a job somewhere. Teaching the voracity of the data must come into question the biases of the person. Did you go to their twitter page? What are they into? How many noam chomsky books of the road? Are you sure they're right?

Speaker 8:          02:27:34       Right?

Speaker 1:          02:27:36       You never know, but you could find out some shit's going down. There's like a. There was a video of the dallas shootout between the guy and the cops, those, uh, the former military guy who killed all those fucking cops.

Speaker 8:          02:27:49       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:27:50       Whew. That's a tough video to watch, man. There's this one scene. I think it was him that did it or someone else who shot someone else. I don't know how. Here's all I saw a person was running down the street and a person in this, this, these two people involved in a gunfight and one guy shot behind the guy and hit the wall behind them and then use that as a distraction to run in front of him and shoot him when he's laying down. I was like, wow, I was. That guy has done

Speaker 5:          02:28:22       this before games. I hate this. I hate to say that. It really is video guys. Well, in this case, if it's the same guy who killed all those people, it's a guy who was in war in the first place. So we'd actually play the ultimate video game. He's playing actual war, but these school shootings and stuff, man, do you remember that call of duty when you walk into the airport? You just mow down people like you just pretty much go into lax with a machine gun. Just start spraying everybody. That alone. I remember you playing a going. I'm. I can't believe my eyes and brain are seeing this right now and I've played so many video games before that I've gone outside and forgot that I'm not in that video game still. This is crazy. So they gunned down all the people. Oh shit. And you're just walking through the airport doing this. You're finding people hiding and stores and shit. What the fuck? Yeah. Oh my god. This is so your brand.

Speaker 5:          02:29:21       So you saw that trump support or suction cup. Michael swimmer guy. See I'm all in favor of video games and I have a problem with quake like violence, but this is fucked up because this is murder. You're just running around and assassinating average moms and dads and brothers and sisters like this is a video game where you're deriving pleasure from gunning people down. Like why would you. And this is available to buy at target is. It is. Yeah. This is call of duty like last few years ago, and look at this guy's walking through the fucking starbucks. Yeah, the bookstore. A choice he's making just gunned down. Don't have to do this. And again, still definitely shoot for you instead basically. But so you can just decide to be a killer and it guess what you're going to do joe, you are actually going to not, you're going to actually shoot people because I've played this and I'm like this is horrible. Why am I doing?

Speaker 5:          02:30:19       And I was like, even like people hiding in the back, please note and be like, I'll talk to them. I'm like, yeah, you're hiding boy. And then he shoot them. Yeah. Oh my god. It's like grand theft auto. I through the same shit man. Like why am I doing this? Like I engraved theft auto. It's a lot more fucked up. I mean, you know, it started with the hooker. Give me a blow job and then killing her. You know, a couple of grand theft auto first came out. Do you have to kill her? No. No. You should just give her money. Let her go about her way and saw, oh, I killed my every time. Get my money back and you killed a hooker. You get your money back and if she has any extra money. Oh my god, dude, that's so crazy. But like, like in grand theft auto, I don't even play the missions.

Speaker 5:          02:31:01       I'll just go to the gun store, get as much as I possibly possibly can and I have like this one part Where height on this second floor of this house and I pretty much or the comedy store hanging out at the comedy store and I pretty much just put it down grenades and bombs and blow up until there are so many cars. It's just a pile of meat on sunset boulevard and it's great fun. yeah, it is fucked up that you can be a monster and with no consequences. I guess in my head I jusT have to say they're all rapists or something, but here's the. But here's the problem. Like at what point in time is this going to become way more disturbing because it's going to be virtual, not virtual yet. It's just you're looking at a screen and have you seen the virtual version of this yet?

Speaker 5:          02:31:45       That they are very aware that it's not real. Right. Like at what point in time are you going to be not aware that it's not real? You gotta throw a grenade at this guy. Really? I tell you, jane anthro? Yeah. Oh yeah. I strap like sticky bombs onto people. But uh, it's gotten to the point where I used to play games. Not this game, but city of heroes is like torkey game. But I played it straight for a month, like every single hour of the day. A long time ago. He chose a broken bottle. Yeah. Oh, jesus christ. You should see what I did in the strip club. I catch it on fire and I just burned strippers. Man. I put my bike in the front door so they can't escape. It's great. This is crazy, man. Oh my god. He just stabbed like this is so fucked up.

Speaker 5:          02:32:32       He stabbing him in the ass of the broken bottle. Oh, jesus christ. Look at this, right? It's butthole. Look is buttholes bleeding. This is so fucked up. You know what, man? Tipper gore was right, she saw the future, she was trying to stop rap lyrics and this is ultimately what was down the road and how girls wife, a lot of people don't remember that. Al gore's wife in the 19 eighties went on a crusade against violent music and a violent lyrics and rap and she was uh, she was hated. It was really interesting and she just shut the fuck up when he was running for president with the chickens. Two live crew. Yeah, she was. She was against a bunch of them. I think it was. Ice tea had an issue with her. Let's get naked and fuck tonight. That was one of jams. That was a joint, a nice ice t joint fused.

Speaker 5:          02:33:28       Uh, I think purple rain, which is what she used to lead that ended up with the rental advisory. Use that as an example. It migHt have been that or something else. I'm reading fifth. Sorry. I lost it. Telling you we're going to take jamie ride to a doctor now. Dr. You're going to take jamie to that talk as minute clinic clinics, working with meg, your head injuries. Prince gave us parental guidance. What if we find that out? You're allergic to me. You have like some black mold in your asshole or something. You're just allergic to my smell. Yo. Dude. I was. Here's some, some crazy shit. Um, did you know that like if someone's allergic to horses they can't even ride in a carriage behind a horse. Oh really? Yeah. And I was thinking of this, you know, women, some women

Speaker 6:          02:34:18       are literally allergic to their man's come, like the guy shoots loads on them. They get rashes all over their body. Like what? Like, like literally some demonic shit, man, like a guy shoots a load on you and like carved his name, takes his load and writes it with his finger and just leaves you there to dry and you have the mark of the demon and stomach. Is that because of food allergies that maybe that's inside the come? Maybe. Maybe he or she is allergic to peanuts and he just eats nonstop peanuts and she does a very good question. It's probably something like that could be. I'm wondering what it meant. I wonder if there's a reason jamie, research that find out what makes come allergenic and uh, feel free to deduct any research from your taxes. I know like some, some girls do that ph balance just, it's totally different from you or whatever.

Speaker 6:          02:35:16       And they break out or to of this is saying she was dosed with diagnosed with human seminal plasma hypersensitivity and allergy to seaman. The problem with guessing that is we don't know how many different people came on her and within it wasn't not at all had the same effect. And what's the pe ratio to do a double blind placebo controlled gang. Not gang bang, but like, um, what would it be? A bunch of users jerked off on a girl circle jerk. there's a little peon come right circle jerk involves a cracker though. No, Like an official sort of sloppy biscuit. Loves that shit. I always thought that a circle jerk involved. Just a bunch of dudes jerking off together, which was weird enough. then I heard that like the last guy to come just to eat the cracker. What kind of a fucking world are we inventing?

Speaker 6:          02:36:09       Why do you think bert so fat from all those crackers come? No, it's he's fat from all the booze to get the com cracker that come. Cracker. I mean, unless there's a billion calories in it as long time ago. Her tom's been working out with chicken. A lot of water. He's your helPer is fat. You're on team. Bird is fat. Whereas versus team thompson against my own mom. Thompson water champ. Yeah. tom is the water champ. Chris. Christina never drinks water. They don't drink water. Do you know they take a shower together all the time and tom piece on her and like what would she Be saying this on the internet? Five guys. Well, I would do that too if I was married. Or did you ever told a crazy story I'd never heard joey diaz told about on there. Maybe it was on their show that about him. Shit in the shower and just push it through, throw it, throw it in the toilet, and that I believe that shit on his on a couple of years ago to stop because he got caught by his wife. He got caught. Two ideas. Is this traits average blue belt? He's a savage. Yeah. He got his blue belt in jujitsu. Fucking shit. Emit blue belt in brazilian jujitsu. He's doing brazilian

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       jujitsu for I believe four or five years now and joe has been like really into it. It's helped them. I don't want to get that wrong, so if I got that number wrong, but if I guessed it, I think it would be four or five years, but he really loves it. He loves it for fitness, for, for health. You know? HE's super humble about it, but if he does it all the time, I bet you every single person who goes against tax out he's going to have is blacked out in like two months. It's like the smell, the smell. What are you saying? SMells now. Think about these things before you say, I remember climbing up the stairs. You'll see margins pc, this joke about you want to see you walk by me when I'm farting up a flight of stairs. You'll see. You'll see marsh has no tolerance for nonsense.

Speaker 1:          02:38:09       It's like if eddie bravo starts talking about eddie ufo or anything like crazy crypto fucking duology type shit or whatever eddie's into recently, jelly will fucking get up and leave the room. BuT joe rogan, I don't want to listen to your fucking you up. We'll talk. Okay. I know. Yeah. That show with duncan. You went looking for bigfoot. Leave them in the fucking forest. Okay. Gentlemen. He used to call tim duncan and satanic, but satan worshiper. She fucking member when anton levay or stand, whichever one it was, the young guy got married and duncan performed at his wedding and sick and he invited a bunch of us to go to his wedding. So we went to his wedding and, and, and duncan was involved with this like satanic, fake, satanic wedding day foley's ex wife was there too. And a satanic duncan. Yeah, because he had this routine that he should do. I don't know if he still does it. He was on his phone. What does he say? Give me some volume.

Speaker 13:         02:39:10       You play this full screen to joey duncan. Duncan trussell. We've got to have a little talk you. When I sit on. What's this? What's this fucking devil shit. I'm hearing. Everybody's telling me you have a worshiper. Duncan duncan. We can't have that. Can't have that. You understand that you're a comedIan. No more of this devil. Shit. You scared. I'm good. I got it from four different people. Not even people I got from one of joe's friends, but everybody else at the store is saying the devil. You're walking around with a fucking crucifix on your head and shit that you put a little fucking tattoo on you and your score was six, six, six that you're calling yourself duncan. This duncan. We can't have this no more. You understand me? If we have to kill a little homo will kill him. No, we can't have. Legit.

Speaker 13:         02:40:07       You're a catholic. Were you raised catholic? But were you raised? All right. That'll be fucking no more of this double shit. We can't have this. You scaring people. These people are white people and just of them bro. They want to call the authorities and shit. You know what I'm saying? His eyes caught by her dog. What's his name by the store? The guy who does the app show wants to call the cops. This is that the atlanta punchline. The old bro. He's got four people called the house and left messages. They're worried about duncan trussell. This shit has to happen. Don't get in the game looking. They take kids like you, they but fuck you. And they picked the same cross up here and then you know what I'm saying? You can't come back from that. You can't recover from that. I'm not fucking laughing here.

Speaker 8:          02:41:03       Yeah, I have.

Speaker 13:         02:41:05       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:41:12       And I remember going when at that time of that period of time, like me and duncan, I would always go to his friend's house, that guy and you'd get these houses. It was like people that believed in st. Maybe not seriously or anything, but I remember going, wow, dunkin is. It's some deep shit to. Dunkin was always, I think a joke, but it was. We were hanging out with really intense tense people, you know, like. Yeah, super intense. Yeah, yeah. Well duncan's into intense humans and intense ideas and for awhile he was really attracted to this idea not of satanism in that satan is an actual being in the devil is real and that you're praying to the devil, but satanism in that these people were like essentially hedonist. They were just like seeking pleasure and trying to have as much fun as they could, but they were also allowing other people to do it too. So you like redefining what satanism is

Speaker 4:          02:42:04       and like, well, if that's okay, that's the problem with all ideologies like you're locked into, if you want to call it satanism and it's all, hey man, just be free. Just have a good time and you know, just fucking do whatever feels good. Terrible. Don't get it. But there's a big difference between that in and of itself, which is an awesome idea, right? Like everybody agrees like you should. Yeah. Have fun, man. We're only here for a little bit at a time. If you get your toes sucked, fucking get your toe socks. Who cares, right, but there is a big fucking difference between that and something that's connected to a demon. It's connected to a fallen angel who became a devil, who lives in us, a smoldering inferno in the middle of the earth, and if he gets a hold of you and you don't listen to god, you will burn to the end of the time. What? What are you retarded? Why does it have to be connected to that?

Speaker 5:          02:42:57       Why is that good feeling and having a good time and pleasure and

Speaker 4:          02:43:01       being a whole bag if that's what you're into. If you're a girl you like, we're in dental, floss up your ass and going out to bars and sucking three dicks. Who cares? Right? Why does it

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       have to be connected to the devil? Because that's a sin. All those are synced to enough. Brian red band. I forsake v enough. Enough with these fuckers.

Speaker 7:          02:43:24       One last little thing I want to show you. I have you seen this new game maybe or may not have. It's called no man's sky. Whoops. What's really interesting about it is, as far as I understand, I'm been trying to figure it out, the uh, there's, it's an unexplored space and if there's something like 10 billion planets that are being populated in this multiplayer universe, and as a player, what you're supposed to do is go and explore and find species and planets. Hold on. Can you say 10 billion planets in the first 24 hours or two days? This was up. They've already named more species in this game than there are on earth. It. See? It's all computer generated. So when you play the game, it automatically generates a planet. So it's just random random shit. Yeah, I get that. But what the fuck? Say that again? It's more species in this game and how many days, and I'll look up that article that says more than more speed, but you know, the reviews of this game is pretty boring. Oh my god. It's just a, it's a little slower of a game. It's not like a first person shooter. It's not that typical kind of game, but it's supposedly a truly open universe. And the game just came out this week. A lot of people have been really anticipating it for like the last couple months.

Speaker 1:          02:44:35       So is this game, it says truly open universe. So is this game constantly inventing itself on the fly? Oh my god. Sort of like real dude. Do you have any idea what it's going to be like when that's on the htc vive and we're not in 2016, but when they're in 2000, 67, we were living in another world man. For instance, in one night we hit 10 million species discovered in mms. That's more than has been discovered on earth. What is going on? It is a testament to how amazing our network coders are. That discoveries are still working at all. Wow. This is yesterday. We're already in a simulation, joe. It is for them. You know, it's like that's a simulation. I mean it's not the best one, but it's like taking a motorola startac. IF someone says, do you have a cell phone? And you're like, yes I do.

Speaker 1:          02:45:33       And you pull out a motorola startac like that's on a fucking cell phone. But it is, it's just not a good one. Like are we already in the simulation? Yeah. Yeah. It's already happened. It's just not good yet. You kind of know it's there, but it's, it's definitely a simulation and it's getting way weirder. It's getting way weirder. I feel like when I pay attention to the news and I paid attention to the internet and I just stepped back and we'll look at this crazy trump clinton race and I look at this. This is bizarre,

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       strange world that we find ourselves sorta like waking up in.

Speaker 5:          02:46:17       I can only imagine how fucking weird it's going to be in a decade. I can only imagine. We should really consider getting water and shelter and figuring out how to get solar power. We can get this kid really fall apart. That guy in Virginia does that. They took away as the land. What guy? There's this, I think it was Virginia. They took away his land because he was off the grid, like he did everything off the grid, so he was not paying any city utility at all and they didn't like it. So they just took his land away from them. Which guys? This uh, if you google image was on the news, Virginia homeowner fighting to keep property from being taken away by eminent domain. Yeah, I think that's it. It's just putting him in that domain is different than when a company gets from february.

Speaker 5:          02:47:07       It's old shit bro. Just too new. I'm going to. Domain is scary because I'm going a domain is like if they're trying to put a highway through something, they can just buy your house. You have to move a put, you know, like you see those houses that are like on the side of the four, oh five. They're doomed. Doomed. They're going to spread that bitch. You can't keep all these fucking people together. It's just not working. There's too many of us. Unless everybody gets automatic cars, there's no more accidents. And even then we're going to realize what a bottleneck. Just the sheer volume of humans there are. I'm pretty sure that's what's going to happen. Like even as China just released their first neW bus

Speaker 12:         02:47:43       cars

Speaker 5:          02:47:43       underneath the bus and I'm going to have you seen that where it's like it looks like this and then the in the middle looks like a, like you're going through a bridge or a tunnel. He so cArs can drive through it in the top part is the bus part and so things like that. Let's say they're at. I saw that it's like it's like a train more than a bus, right? Because the tracks. Yeah. But things like that I think are going to improve a lot. I mean imagine if that was just a non continuous retards going to be playing pokemon and slam into your fucking train. Knock it over on a traffic. Right? Yeah. That's the problem is when you have that and retain things that are like regular cars that are driving the same road together. If you go under someone, you're almost like in contact with them. So if you get an accident while you're under there, guys will change lanes while they're underneath those buses and they'll collide into each other and they'll fucking spin the, the bus out of control to go off the rails

Speaker 14:         02:48:38       crashed and other people, the pulp will die in a horrible crash on the four. Oh, five in los Angeles. The best pub we've ever had was last at this ridiculous policy of public transportation in los angeles has always been an individual transportation city. People love their cars. they love to be by themselves.

Speaker 5:          02:48:56       I'm looking at this article. I found out this, uh, this might not even be real, like this thing obviously exists. It's a real thing. But the. See this exact one that showed last week or whenever this came out was the same

Speaker 7:          02:49:07       whatever train bus you want to call that showed in a test that they use six years before this. And it was only on like a 300 meter piece of land and 30. Even now this says like if this project is even feasible or if it's even real, wasn't. They were just road testing it like this. Or I read it as if they're just like, they're just seeing if this would work. Like testing, huh?

Speaker 4:          02:49:30       Well It makes sense. Yeah. I mean it makes sense to have something like that, but if people can judge whether or not they. Like if something's on sale, if it's a car, it's one thing if a guy's hitting the brakes and turn the wheel and all that stuff, it's one thing. Or if a bus same kind of thing, but as soon as people interact with trains, I have a problem with that because like one of them is like super steady and static or move to the same sort of speeds and it's not. It doesn't vary. That was hit the brakes and do a bunch of things that people have cars do and the other one does. So the one that does the one that's real mobile, the person driven car is going to figure out how to time that train. They got to take some chances if they're all running through the same road together and they're cutting each other off and yeah, there's gonna be some asshole doesn't seem like it's to work as good people are going to tax. They're going to slam into that thing. It's just weird. Can have a train in the car in the same place.

Speaker 7:          02:50:25       It seems about as real as hyperloop maybe is right now. Which.

Speaker 4:          02:50:28       Yeah, well that's sort of real. At least everything that is real now. It was a whisper at one time, so I. Hyperloop is real in the sense that no one's written on it yet, but that is, that's moving. There's, there's movement in that direction. There's, there's concepts, there's engineers working, there's design, there's all sorts of different people involved in technology. They're beIng consulted. They're trying to figure out how to make that actually come to light so that it is a real. it's just, it's a. It's in the embryonic stages. That fucking thing is going to happen, man. We're going to be able to jet across the whole country and like an hour. No. That's going to feel like, dude, I'm going to shit my pants. Shit. My pants was going to go on a regular plane goes, what? Five hundred miles an hour. Sure. Okay, let's go 200 mIles an hour.

Speaker 4:          02:51:18       So you get to the other side of the country in an hour and a half and he just pinned to your seat. Try to get up to go to the bathroom. It's like, good luck, dear crosses. It derails. Boom. Flying the deer crosses it. The front end of it is built like a sword. Yeah, just slices through the deer. That's what they should have. They should have like the front of the thing should be like, like you know those things that you. WHen you cut an onion, you drop it down like slice or like an egg, like a hard boiled egg. You know those things? Slice slicer. That's what the front of the train should be. It should be razor sharp swords that if you're so retarded, do you want to step out or you want to push your cow in front of the just to make a youtube video.

Speaker 6:          02:52:06       It just gets exploded instantaneously. Just gets sliced through and turned to mush. They pretty much have that are already in the design when it's usually like a v or illuminati triangle, you know, which brings us back to that cop shoot, that deer, that deer got eaten by a bunch of hungry people, sit nearly as much of a problem that you're going to say the deers and the illuminati that that new aluminum, the deer, the deer. What the deere wants to do is stop the white christian from profile. That's why dear exist in mostly primarily white christian towns. Go to brooklyn. Find yourself a dear. Good luck. Good luck. Go by canter's deli and la st louis and find yourself a dear. Good luck. Will you find jews. You do not find deer juice, but where you find good christian folk that the jews have made sure that dare grow takeover and suicide bombing your automobile of. You're fine with that. That's only you but me. I want to mad max bumper from mad max. When you go to places like South Dakota, any of those places where there's a lot of deer, I think do. Would you say Michigan is the worst? You say? Michigan. We went over the country like how many different people get in car accidents with deer every year, and I think Michigan was fucking insane. Like more than a hundred thousand people get in car accidents a year with deer. Well, to Be honest, alabama's the worst. What is that? What are they at?

Speaker 5:          02:53:52       One and 127. One in 100. 20 seven car accidents involve the deer chance of collision. It says with, oh my god, that's a one percent chance. Essentially. That's like if you drive 100 times, one time we got to kick fucking crazy. That is if you drive 100 times, how many times did you have 100 jobs? Michigan's a little. Oh, there's a couple of. Mississippi is the highest. Michigan is one in 94. Wow. Minnesota times, but it doesn't matter if there's a deer in the road. Why does that, dan, rather than fuck it, bro. Hippies. One in 84. Oh my god. And montana's one in one 75 Pennsylvania, one in 71. And then the top one, I was in Montana recently, every fucking person up there has a battering ram welded to the front of their truck. Everyone one in 39. Oh my god. Oh my god, I wasn't. Sorry, go ahead. I was in Michigan like a year ago and we drove down to do shows in like Michigan to columbus, Ohio to whatever. But the drive from Michigan to columbus, there was so many dead deer on the side of the road, like every half mile there was just dead

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       bodies and in blood it was just guts and blood and deer everywhere. It was really disgusting how many deer deer there were. There's a lot. And there's rules and whether or not you can eat it like a. If you get there like right after the accident, I think you can call the cops and some states and they'll let you take the deer home and eat it. Which is nice. I mean if somebody leaves it behind, look, if you're a person that's poor and you run across a deer that just got hit by a car, that's like a hundred pounds of meat. That's like 100 meals, you know what I mean? That's amazing for your family, you know you can all. So there's a lot of people that get excited about roadkill, but the real problem is it kills. I think he kills 200 people a year in this country.

Speaker 1:          02:55:46       Is that the number? I think it's 200 people a year in this country alone. Die from collisions with deere 200 times more than we'd. Well it's two. It's 2 million car accidents or one point 5 million car accidents in this country every year with dear one point 5 million. And I think the number of people that dies like 200. Does that make sense? But either way. One point 5 million on 100 percent sure of that. It says leads to about 200 human deaths in one point. $1,000,000,000 in property damage. Seen them property damage thing. So what about the deer's life? Because that not worth money. You son of a bitch. Oh, you put money on life. I'm a killer. I turned into a werewolf that bear video I think you posted the other day. Oh yeah. That's so fucked up. Not good. That makes me want to buy a gun just for that.

Speaker 1:          02:56:42       Not good. There's a lot of not good lately. What did you see? The mountain lion one for the mountain lion was falling. The guy around trying to figure out whether or not it should jack. I'm so not good. Big ass old cat. It's a big fucking cat and it's looking at them. I don't know if it's an old cat, but I mean it's. It's a mature cat. Big cat. Did he do it? He should have done and that sits like you kind of walked away and I thought you're not supposed to. You're not supposed to walk back, but you have to be careful and challenging it. You're not supposed to look at it in the eyes because it might. It might instill a primal rage in that fucking murderers predator where it just decides to fuck you up. It's hard to say what you're supposed to do and what you're not supposed to do because I've heard people say that you should talk loud and I've heard people say that you should just walk away, jiggle your car keys.

Speaker 1:          02:57:32       Yeah. I mean, I don't think you can predict. Just like you can't predict like a regular cat. You'll get how many people have different kinds of cats, like you have different cats that I have. We all have different cats and I've had a bunch of the same kind of cats. They behave different. They just all fucking animals are different, man. You can run across one wolf that wants to fuck you up and you could walk. Well you can come across another wolf that doesn't want to have anything to do with you and wants to stay in the background and move away from you. So it's entirely possible that this guy just ran across a cat that was thinking about eating a person. What would he have been able to kill this and had been okay. Like, oh man. Self defense. Yeah. Yeah. If he had a weapon, but I don't think he had a weapon. I don't think he had anything like this. This isn't. Okay. You couldn't have just killed it because it's near them. You would have to make a judgment call and you'd have to be able to support that judgment call. Like if someone was out there, right? So if you were a bow hunter and you have an a stare down with this mountain lion, you have to be absolutely sure that you've exhausted. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:58:34       all of the possibilities. But there's a fine line, right? Is like you want to, you want to be able to preserve your own life. You want to make sure that you're okay, but you also want to you, if you're going to kill this thing, you want to be right about it. So you have to figure out what is that. When you may hit that switch. So do you hold onto the arrow and you hold your bone front of that cat. Like right there. I gotta be honest with you. I might shoot that fucking cat. The cat is 15 feet away from him and this guy got away with it, but he didn't have to and now the cat's moving in on him at 15 feet away. The problem is once this thing jumps on you, you don't have a fucking chance. And once it realizes how weak you really are because you look way bigger than it, you're standing like right there.

Speaker 4:          02:59:18       That cat's dead right there. Broadside. That's 15 feet away from. I'm drawn an arrow back and I'm getting rid of that cat. I can't take that chance. I'm not going to die. I'm not going to die because I don't want it to die. I don't want to kill it, but I don't want it to kill me for sure. And this is an animal that is absolutely stocking a person. It's trying to figure out whether or not it can do it. Now, in this guy's case, he got lucky. He talked enough. He maybe he was a bigger guy. Maybe the cat just didn't feel like it was worth it. I'd been throwing rocks. Maybe. Maybe the rocks would make it charge. If you don't know, man, you don't know. That's the problem. If someone can tell you if, uh, the, the general rule of thumb is if a bear attacks you play dead. But if a cougar attacks you fight back.

Speaker 1:          03:00:01       Where was this app by the way? I think he was on his bike so he had his bike in between them. So maybe that's good. Use it as like a little shield or something. Fuck yeah, I'd be taking those tires off. I'd beat that fucking thing to death. I'd be scared as fuck right here to. This guy is so cool about this.

Speaker 15:         03:00:15       Unbelievable. There's a mountain lion right here.

Speaker 4:          03:00:26       I mean folks were free. People listening. It's on a trail. This thing is 15 feet in front of them right in front of me. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's 15 feet in front of him, right? I mean maybe 20. And he says this helmet on. Whatever that thing's bite your face off. This is a nice time to own a gun. Right here is nice. You go, hey man. Hey man. Check this out. Boom. Fuck you. I don't know what I would've done if I was. If you have a gun, you shoot it the ground. You just just go, bitch. Oh, he's moving towards it. It's cute.

Speaker 6:          03:01:01       I might say to you, I might. He's backing up. I might. I might go crazy and see if I could scare them off here. That's probably what I would be doing. I'd be screaming at it more. Be dead. Yeah, most likely. Let's be honest. He'd be wheezing. Delicious. You lit a cigarette up. Maybe he'd run away. Yeah, I would use fire cigarette smoking house. I would probably do that. I'd probably like if I had my lighter and light my shirt on fire or something like that. There was an old man in Canada just a couple of years ago, killed one with a knife. He got attacked by a mountain lion and you're 60 years old. He's fighting off and cut its neck fighting to the death with a monster

Speaker 1:          03:01:38       jumps out clause. A hold of them. Yeah. I think mountain lions for just for the record. I think mountain lions are fucking awesome. I'm a big fan of mountain lions. There's a lot of the people that are animal rights activists, they might hear this and say, what about the person? The person shouldn't be there. That's the lion's home. A persons in the lion's home. Let's be honest folks. There's people that are beautiful. They produced poetry, they write songs, they make movies, they love you. They take you out to dinner, they're your friend. You can count on them. They offer emotional support. Mountain lions don't give you any of that shit. So when it comes, when it comes to. I know why I said poetry, I believe I agree with everything I said up to poetry, but it comes to who do I like more? Mountain lion or that guy on the bike. I don't even know that guy on the bike. I love him. Give him a hug. I shoot that fucking thing. If I was nearby creepy ass predator cat,

Speaker 6:          03:02:32       it would be cool to have a full simulation. Like you can be like, all right, I'm going to see what happens if I went up to it as if it was a normal cat, like kind of like grizzly man style. You just see red screen. Yeah, but if you could try everything. Like now I'm ready. Tried through mushu. It'd be like a lawnmower. Hit your face spray all over the screen. I just wonder like if there was like that kind of calming approach or anything. No, no, no. What are you the grizzly man? Hey mr. It's going to be okay. He must just chocolate. I remember there's a scene, the grizzly man where uh, the bear took a shit and he's like, this came out of this. Came out of her butt touching. I feel like I'm touching inside of her. Came out of her, but I get his hands on bear shit. I wish there could be a sequel to that movie so bad. Like bob ross could plAy it. Or here's the thing. It

Speaker 1:          03:03:31       wasn't a sequel, but that guy made I think more than a hundred hours of footage. He had a, an entire show that they did on one of the reality tv channels were. It was a grizzly man show where it was like they edited a lot of his last footage and it was really fascinating because as misguided as this guy was who was definitely misguided and he definitely had some issues for sure. He really

Speaker 4:          03:03:57       did love bears and he was really passionate about bears and he was passionate about describing various aspects of their behavior and it was really interesting and he got some fucking bad ass footage, man. He got some incredible footage like really close up footage of bears fighting. He got footage of bears coming right up to him and say like literally sniffing his hand and running away. He got footage of wild fox is becoming his friend, like hanging around his camp and he would feed them and hang out with them. They'd steal his hat. He got amazing footage, so if you look at the guy's just like a wildlife photographer, uk, he's like one of the greatest of all time in a way because what he did was something that nobody was willing to do. Go full screen on this motherfucker. Can't put this on youtube. Right.

Speaker 4:          03:04:44       Of course, of course. Of course, of course, this is, um, if you haven't seen this, this is two bears. I think we did commentary on this during the ice house chronicles because I was talking about jitsu. I was like, he's got very good jujitsu. like the way the big bear on top, it's passing. The other guy on the bottom is trying to work the guard. He's putting feet on the hips, but the big bears using pressure. He's like a old school like sallow. He barrow like fucking rock solid jujitsu. Like this is what I'm looking at here. And pooping, he's, oh yeah, they shit the shit while they're going to war. But this is very much like jujitsu in a lot of ways. Man, I'm. When I'm, when I'm watching this, this is, this is like rafael lovato. This is that kind of jujitsu, like super strong, real technical pressure power to get on top of you.

Speaker 4:          03:05:33       And they put the fucking clamped down on you and you're dead. Like this. Bear is kind of doing that. But the bottom bear got up. Look at this. He's game. He's not as big, but he's game. They go to war, the guy on the left is considerably smaller if you see it, you see how much smaller is like the one on the right is like literally like 25 percent larger, but the guy in the bottom is not given up. It's like marcello garcia, rico rodriguez, you motherfuckers don't even know she steps training. You see that video of a wrestler versus a bodybuilder and like the same kind of thing where the bodybuilders. Super huge and you're like wrestling for somebody. there's a jujitsu. When is pedro sAuer versus a bodybuilder? I'll maybe that's it. Well pedro sauer I think. Look up this pedro sauer s a u e r versus I'm a bodybuilder and I think the dude was like, I want to say it was like 240 pounds and pedro sauer was like 1:50 and he got in this like street fight with this guy in a gym and this is back in the day when like the gracie challenges were going on.

Speaker 4:          03:06:32       She'll like that. This is the guy he's fucking jacked. And pedro sauer I believe is hixon gracie linneage. I apologize if I'm Wrong, but either way, he's a super respected. I know he's great. He's got a gracie ngayon, super respected jujitsu instructor and competitor, so he's got this giant Bodybuilder in front of him and he's like side kicking him in the thigh. This is so old school. I

Speaker 1:          03:06:56       wish I knew what year this was, but he keeps hitting him with his front legs because even thought he's way small than this guy and the bodybuilder yet to move. Now he tries to make his move and he throws a punch, but it didn't work in and pedro sauer starts jacking him with punches and so the guy takes him down. So now when the guy takes him down, pedro sauer immediately sweeps him, mounts on them, and that the dude rolled him over at least one time, but pedro didn't really take any damage. You see how good like a real legit brazilian jujitsu practitioner is at protecting himself, and then especially the fact that he's wearing a gi, which is even better because he can really. Even though the other guy is, he's bare chested, if pedro's we're an aggie, he can control the guy because it's all, it's grippy, you know, the allows you to hold onto a big fucking sweaty gorilla like this guy. So he eventually catches homeboy in an arm bar. It's not the same video I saw it, but it's just pretty much idea. Yeah. I want to say this was like 95 or something like that. So he's holding onto the dude. What does it say?

Speaker 1:          03:07:56       what does it say? That guy was 92, mr Utah. So I thought I thought it was in [inaudible] 92. Well, pedro sauer. I think he's in Utah. I think he's a salt lake city guy. I'm pretty sure I might be wrong, but in either way, pedro sauer, super respected, very a very high level jujitsu instructor. A lot of blood here. Man. Who's got the blood? Look at that. Oh shit. Armbar son. I think he. He made that dude's fucking nose explode before your arm barred him. Is that guys face a bloody mess?

Speaker 16:         03:08:30       Really?

Speaker 1:          03:08:31       Yeah. Yeah, there It is. That's the blood. Yeah. He punched him in the nose and choke the shit out of him and then took his. Took his arm, old school son, but the difference in strength and size, pretty substantial. what did you say? Mine was obviously one of those facebook videos I guess who wins when you progress wrestler versus a bodybuilder in the bodybuilder was just this huge monster bodybuilder and the rest are just had no problem. Just throwing them on the ground constantly. Just it was just wrestling. I was an mma but it wasn't a pro wrestler. You said progress or was it just like. Just like. no, no, like I'm not a progress wrestler. Like a professional wrestler. Like s like oh, like someone is an expert. Expert. Expert. Yeah. Progress was used to be real wrestlers, like not that they're not now.

Speaker 1:          03:09:16       Now they're more real entertainers, but they can wrestle. Obviously brock lesnar can wrestle, but the original days of progressing it wasn't fake. It is the weirdest thing. That is the only sport that's a sport in the fucking olympics, but in the professional world it's fake. And when I say fake, I don't mean it disrespectfully. I know, joked around about progressing a lot of progressing fans. Got super butthurt. Listen, I absolutely respect the athletes and their abilities and what they're doing. I like to fuck with tony hinchcliffe folks. Okay. It's fun. He loves wrestling a little too much and if you burned along with

Speaker 4:          03:09:54       that. I'm so sorry, but my honest feelings about pro wrestling as I. It disturbs me that guys who are so good and women who are so good at wrestling don't have a professional venue for it. we're wrestling is so exciting on an amateur level. Whereas like tennis players have massive opportunities. Everybody else has massive opportunities. I mean, I guess swimming doesn't, but a lot of like big time sports have these huge opportunities, but what? Swimming doesn't have his amateur swimming and then fake swimming where they're like rolling. He's got jello. He got the job. all ladies and gentlemen, Michael Phelps says doing joe out tomorrow, renelle low and he would have elton john sunglasses on and a fucking chuck liddell mohawk and he'd be doing the pro wrestling version of swimming with go pro swimming. Yeah, nick, nick fucking. What's his name? The guy who runs a pro wrestling, vince mcmahon, fensick man, he puts a bandanna on his neck and he has a one of those mark spitz mustaches.

Speaker 4:          03:10:56       This is a new look, and he just talks about pro swimming for. We're taking pro swimming the same place we took pro wrestling. Alex Jones, Michael Michael Phelps is like, fuck man. You know, uh, I love wheaties as much as the next guy, but I'm tired. I'm tired of just living off sponsors. I got to watch what I do. I can't smoke weed. This is Bullshit. Why don't I have a professional venue? Hey man, if, if fucking golf is in the olympics and golfers make millions of dollars, everybody got a damn swims, you'll know how to swim. Didn't erase your cousin when you were a kid. We all know how to swim, right? Okay, let's make pro swimming. Let's do this. He gets together with vince mcmahon. they have swimming. that's good idea. Like there's hoops that they guys don't even care like it. Espn launches new wwe vertical. What?

Speaker 4:          03:11:40       What does that mean? Was a vertical. They're going to start covering wwe or you hard right now. No job. You're whoa, whoa. Why would a sports thing, and we decided to do that because they don't need money. I know it's entertainment, but like the. Well apparently these shows are doing not so good because of the internet, because of the different. like if you're talking about like where you get your news and your entertainment and your coverage of different sports. A lot of people turned to the internet. Say if you had a studio, okay, and you had a studio in hollywood and you said, hey, you know what? I enjoy the ufc coverage. I enjoy a bella tours coverage. I enjoy all these different mixed martial arts, but I want to do my own new show and I'm just going to put it on youtube and I'm going to hire dean.

Speaker 4:          03:12:29       Thomas is essentially what dana white's done with that. Looking for a fight show. What if someone comes along and says, I'm going to do that with a cowboy serone some fun, colorful characters and a. I'm going to have them talk about fights every week. Who is going to watch the espn show? If you can watch brian stann, dominic serone and, or, uh, uh, donald cerrone and cruz talk about fights. Who the fuck is going to watch anything else? I want to hear what they have to say. I want to hear what donald has to say about conor mcgregor. I wanna hear with dominick. Cruz has say about cody garbrandt. I want to hear like what, what these like super influential fighters who were like some of those interesting characters in the world. I have to say you're not gonna be able to recreate that with some talking head that used to cover women's volleyball and now he's covering mma and you know last night, blah blah blah.

Speaker 4:          03:13:21       Amanda nunez became the cleveland indian women can mean, you know, he doesn't give a fuck. He doesn't give a fuck. He doesn't care. You would, you would watch the internet show, right? So if the internet was available on your tv, what's an espn gonna do. And that's common man that's coming. Bill burrs gonna have a fucking football show on espn and everybody better shut their mouth because it's bill burr hasn't like if he does what he does on his podcast, I don't even follow the nfl, but when he starts making fun of people of the in the nfl and talking about fans and stuff on his podcast, it's hilarious if someone wises up and gives bill burr some sort of a platform, a gigantic platform reviewing football. Oh my god, everybody else has done carl because he knows his shit too. Like bill burr understands football.

Speaker 4:          03:14:12       Like when I listened to them like, oh, this guy is not just like a comedian talking shit about stuff. he actually understands football. I can listen to them talk about anything. I love that dude. He's an american treasure. Fuck. Yeah. That's more like the delivery method has outpaced. Yes. Content. I guess it's eliminated the necessity of a large studio. Like a friend of mine was going to do something on the internet recently and he's like, this group wants to pay me money to be, you know, to be associated with this. And I go, okay, what are you going to do it on? And he goes, I'm going to do it on youtube and my uncle, uh, why would you want to, why would you want someone coming along and being a part of that when you can just do it yourself. Like if you get.

Speaker 4:          03:14:56       I'm like, if you get in bed with this person or this group, there's a media conglomerate, you get a bed, this media conglomerate with your project that you're trying to launch online, you're going to be relieved as some of the financial burden. But in this case I was talking to a guy is not hurting for money. I'm like, you're not talking about a substantial investment. What do you need? You need a camera. You need to an employee, you need an upload place. You need to send out. You need something like youtube is essentially free. You just need a good internet connection. Good computers like the, the price of entry is not exorbitant in relationship to the potential. But if you get involved with some sort of a media conglomerate, these guys, all of these people are very smart. All these people that are involved in all these different networks, they have existed for the longest time.

Speaker 4:          03:15:43       They are the old vampire versions of hollywood like they've existed forever and they've grown up in this and some of them have come along in different transitionary phase of the system, but they realize right now the system is in jeopardy. It's in a very strange place because the internet is slowly becoming more and more prevalent in people's lives. It's consuming more and more people's entertainment time and it's becoming more powerful and its abilities. The ability that someone has today is what you can create an edit on a computer. It's literally getting to the point where I could make a movie with you and you don't even have to be in it. I can just decide I'm going to make fucking slumber party 10 with jamie vernon and slow. Jamie vernon shows up aT the door with a fucking pizza delivery outfit on and 15 skanky hose. Just dive on his pecker and we make a porn. I mean, this 100 percent possible. That's the only like 10 years away from now, man, and you're going to be able to stream things online. You're going to be able to create a film with a regular laptop in a fucking phone and it's going to look like a goddamn movie. People have probably already done it.

Speaker 7:          03:16:49       snapchat filters, so there's a good example. If you do it right now I can make a movie. Jamie I gay porn. Exactly. I read an article about what you're talking about really that they used the example of the new peewee herman movie that he looks a little too young for what he should be throughout the movie, but they article describes how there's this thing called what they're called cgi facelifts and there's multiple million dollar actors and actresses that use teams of people or keep them at a younger looking and in movies like. Like whaT the did for benjamin button. She made brad pitt stay younger. Looking at like was strapping 22 year old dude when he was really like 45. That's just a filter. You can tell the detail level is just fogged out, you know, as a still frame. It's a filter, but he looks like that throughout the whole movie. So it's a separate video on that.

Speaker 4:          03:17:32       I think he's. What he's saying is that this is a still frame of the video. Yeah. And uh, but there's just like. I know what you're saying. No, no, I was saying they're doing it through movies and a rabbit. This is the whole movie. It's like this, right? Like, is this an actual still friends?

Speaker 7:          03:17:46       As far as I know. Yeah. I looked. Even snapchat has that one filter that makes. It's called the pretty filter or beautiful filter. It just pretty much does the same thing. I kinda softens your face and gets rid of the detail.

Speaker 4:          03:17:56       Well, have you seen the real life filters that they use in their. They have this new thing that they've invented where it's a film that they put on your skin and it radically reduces wrinkles. Oh wow. Like it's an invisible film. It lasts 24 hours. You put it on your skin and it's waterproof and it radically reduces wrinkles. Have you seen this? No, I haven't seen it. Cool. Fucking weird thing to think about it. We're going to bang some old lady's dude. Oh god, 100 percent for you. Good. You drink a loT of good with my 22 year old. Remember that time in austin? Which one do you remember the time where a lady sat next to you and started kissing you and you were hammered? You thought it was the wrong lady. Do you remember that? We've talked about that before. The old lady, old lady got deep into brian's face. Mountain. Brian's mouth was. His eyes were closed the whole time. Brown brian had a lovely lady with him.

Speaker 1:          03:18:48       And by the way, this is a long, long time ago. Yeah. Any parties currently invested in mr brian red band. Need not worry. Many, many, many, many, many, many moons ago. And uh, this lovely young lady took off and this, uh, this, this woman parked her broomstick and sat down next to god like 70 years old. No tea, no bullshit. At least 60, no bullshit. At least 60. And she just attacked me out of nowhere. Plopped down next year. Put her hand on your chest. You smiled and looked over with your eyes closed. And she dove in for The kiss and you thought you were kissing the other girl and then you realized in the middle it was like, oh, it's like there's a horror movie where that happens. Where the guys making out with the girl and her face falls apart. You realize that she's a monster.

Speaker 1:          03:19:39       Isn't there a horror movie like that? Well, in part of Indiana jones where they opened up the chest and that nazis face melts. Kind of. Yeah, it's like that. But there was a movie where a guy was making out with a girl and I want to say like her hair started falling out or something like that was god damn it. What movie was it? Oh, the shining is this shining. remember Jack Nicholson goes into one of those mysterious rooms and he starts making out with this woman and her skin starts falling off exactly what it is. IT's exactly what it is. Oh my god. Find that scene. Let's end this podcast and you recorded the whole thing on video and you thought you were doing me a favor by deleting it. I would love to have seen that. I know I fucked up. I was trying to protect her brother.

Speaker 1:          03:20:17       It was dark. It was dark shit. I don't even think she had teeth. She was a monster. I was right out of the swamps. She came out of swamps. You can't show it. But for us, can we see it where nobody else sees it? Put it on, make sure that nobody sees it, which just showed you and nobody can see it. Right. Okay. Yeah. So she's super, super hot in that 19 seventies. I don't know how to work out hot, which is great for like eight years. Nice area. Look, girls, girls have that hot for eight years, right around 26. It starts to go, hey. Um, we're not really making the same amount of hormones anymore. And you don't want to play soccer. Oh, what's going on with his body like that? Bush full bush, bush, bush. Uh, which by the way, I don't mind. I don't mind. It doesn't bother me at all. It was Jack Nicholson doesn't know what to do. She's touching him. Oh shit.

Speaker 1:          03:21:11       I don't remember this scene. and I definitely don't remember the scene being this long. I remember it being like real short. I feel like I watched this recently and don't remember the scene in the movie. I remember it happened for sure. Which is why I brought it up, but I don't remember it. Like I'm looking at it. This all seems super new to me. So he starts making out with her. she's got to fly the house, squats, go to go to the gym, bitch. Oh, oh. So he's kissing her and in the middle of kissing her, I was like, oh, he's having such a good time. You could see that she looks a little bony. Yeah, something's not right. Something's wrong. Then he opens his eyes and he opens his eyes and you realize she's an old lady. His eyes go wide open. He can't even enjoy it.

Speaker 1:          03:21:50       He's a hater. Oh, she's got turns. Moly. Caesar in the mirror and her back in the mirror is covered with welts and his little kid starts seizure. And now she's in the tub and he's backing up. She's decaying. She's laughing and coming towards him. Holy shit, this is a good movie. It's like an old lady from kingpin. See, here's my point. Where the fuck are these movies? Man? This is my kind of movie. I like horror movies. I'm a huge fan. I like monster movies. I like horror movies. Doesn't have to be real. I know it's not real.

Speaker 7:          03:22:20       I haven't seen him, but I heard that movie. Green room is supposed to be pretty interesting. What's that? There's a new one called a where the blind man can't see it. It looks pretty intense too. I forgoT. Don't, don't talk or don't whisper.

Speaker 1:          03:22:32       How could that be as good as this green room story of louie anderson?
