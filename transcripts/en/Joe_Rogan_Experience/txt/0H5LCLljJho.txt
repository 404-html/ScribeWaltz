Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Rogan experience Joe Rogan podcast. And we're live gentlemen, here we go again. What's happening back in the room? A pleasure to see you guys. As always. This is one of my favorite podcasts that we ever do. And uh, this is very timely because first of all, the Big New York Times article about the possibility of a, a comet hitting Los Angeles. The preparations for what they would do if a common hit Los Angeles. And uh, the comment, no one has Donald Trump that's hit the United States and he's even got the hair and just the whole thing is, I mean, if the end of the world was coming, boy, it's all on the wall. You know, the writing's all there. It's kind of crazy. So what's the latest and the greatest?

Speaker 2:          00:00:47       Well, the latest and the latest and the greatest is like, I mean last year when we sat down with you, I think it was last November. Yeah, it was almost a year got floated in the discussion. The idea that this really important comet research that's going on, which is just changing our whole view of history and prehistory and of the future of humanity, that it would be good to make a film about this. And crowdfunded. I actually mentioned that to the scientists and they said what we really need is more funding for our research. And so they've inspired by basically by your shell, they have put out a crowdfunding campaign, um, which is linked on my, on my website, it's the comic research group. Um, uh, it's, it's a big story right now. So how can people find it really quickly? It's indeigogo well researched much quicker way. Just go, just go to my website, Graham hancock.com and there's a revolving banner, which is the comic research group. Click on that and you're in business. Beautiful. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       Graham hancock.com and then crowdfunding for common research. And so what are they you are trying to put together?

Speaker 2:          00:01:50       Well, they're, they're wanting to, he said, the thing is these guys have actually not had any official funding. This is a group of major, highly credentialed scientists who for the last decade have been investigating the extraordinary story of a massive comic series of comic impacts on the North American ice cap 12,800 years ago. That is the, the global cataclysm that wipes out a whole civilization from, from prehistory. So that's why it's of interest to me. Um, they're not coming at it from that point of view. They're coming at it from rediscovering something that we've lost about ourselves. Something is really important to understand the role of cataclysms in the story of the earth and they need to do much more research. So they need to go back to greenland and, and look for the nano diamonds in the, in, in the greenland ice cores they need, there's a, there's an ancient city, which they're not revealing the name of which they're pretty certain was wiped out by a comet impact about four and a half thousand years ago. They want to go there and investigate that. So there's a lot of field work they need to do to drive home this hypothesis and to frankly put down the opposition because there's been so much opposition to this idea from people with vested interest in other theories that a,

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       and that's why these guys have not got funding, so the only place they're going to get funding to do this further research is from members of the general public and that's what we're hoping that will will happen. It's called the comet research group. There's a banner on my site and all the links are there to their crowd funding, to their website, which is full of masses of scientific information and to their facebook page as well. It is a very unusual thing, the the fact that we know that comments and all sorts of various large objects have impacted the earth. We see the craters, we know they exist, but it's so rarely discussed. It's so, it's so strange. If it wasn't for this article in the New York Times, I can't remember when the last time, and that even came up and it's such a huge issue.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       It's a massive issue. It's a massive issue, both randall and I have really, you know, give it a great deal of thought to this. And I think Randall, the point is that catastrophes are the untold story of our past. We were given a little, we were given a little hint of it. Um, February of 2013. Chelyabinsk Siberia. Remember the event? Yeah, yeah. No, that was just a little cosmic Spec came in. I was about 50 feet in diameter, which is about, um, and it came in at a fairly low angle of blew up nearly 18. Get that thing right in front of you. Right in front of me. Like this. Yeah. If you have flat it out, it's usually easier when there's better. Yeah. There we go. So it, it came in, I think it exploded 12 miles, about 20 kilometers up in the atmosphere, but it was still enough to damage thousands of buildings and injure 1500 people.

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       Now, the thing about that one is if it had been slightly larger, if it had come in at a slightly steeper angle, a little bit higher velocity, you could have had thousands of fatalities. Rather than just injuries. And that would have been major headline news at that point as it was. It's already forgotten. But you do remember. Yes. Oversight. We may even talk have talked. I believe we did. We did. Yeah. We showed videos of it. Yeah. What's fascinating is a, Russia has so many of those trail camp on not trail cam mom, uh, Dash Cam photo cameras. That's right. Cause they have so much insurance fraud apparently over there and people slam into each other all the time and we want to record it. So we were fortunate enough to have so many of those videos because of that, which puts it on the record.

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       Whereas other, otherwise it would, it would not be, I think, I think people don't, it doesn't like to talk about cataclysms and catastrophes and actually nor do I, nobody wants a horrible cataclysm to occur. But this is the point which is that the prospect of a comet or asteroid cataclysm on the earth is actually much higher than has been told to us up till now. And something can be done about it. It doesn't have to be the end of the world. We don't have to say, okay, it's all over. Forget about it. Quite the contrary, this is, this is just something that would be prudent and rational for the human species to do and amongst many other imprudent and irrational things that we focus on. Instead, we should be focusing on a bit on this at least just to heighten awareness of it and and also the possibility that we been nailed a bunch of times and we've forgotten about it and this is, this is the big thing that you've been dealing with your entire career, this skepticism about past civilizations.

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       I mean, I got into it with Michael Shermer, who's a friend of mine who's a very famous skeptic. I got into him with it yesterday because I posted that you were going to be on and he started chirping something about civilizations 12,000 years ago. Where's the evidence on like, dude, you don't even, you're saying this and you don't even know about gold Beckley tappy so I sent him, go back to the tapping. Literally like five hours later he wrote something claiming that while that was made by hunter gatherers, it was all just really to sort of suit his narrative. So he doesn't know that. No one knows that. He knows that they are so determined to keep the existing model and when new evidence comes in, which company explained by the existing model, they just tried to explain away the new evidence and not not think, maybe it's time to change our theory.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       You know, this is, this is the, and the unfortunate thing, but cataclysms a global cataclysm, the massive event that happened 12,800 years ago, the younger dryas impact, which were a series of comet impacts on the North American ice cap. This accounts for why we don't have a lot of evidence, hard evidence of a 12,000 plus year old civilization because it went down in that catastrophe was wiped out. I've been trying to amass the evidence actually that compliments what Graham was doing and it really answers that question at schermer brought up, and it's a legitimate question, where's the evidence? But I'm quite sure that Schermer is not really educated in the extreme events that have really taken place on this planet in the last 10 to 20,000 years. Um, and what that would do to any kind of evidence. And maybe while we have some time here today, I brought a few things to try to convey some sense of how extreme some of these changes of ban and how one would actually be quite shocked to find anything existing in the aftermath of these events.

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       Well, Michael Shermer is a brilliant guy and I don't mean to shit on him, but, but what, what is disturbing to me is that his knee jerk reaction to this without having any research at all in the subject, not knowing it all about go back like tabby, which was discovered in what, the nineties yeah, 96. So this is, to me, this is something that I've looked at because of you guys in great depth. When I read your book, I was just completely enthralled with this idea of history, having some sort of, uh, uh, or rise and fall and civilization having these resets. So I've been absorbed in it for a long time. But what's fascinating to me is people that consider themselves to be skeptical or you know, or I mean he's a skeptic professional issue, but many people who question anything that's outside of what they've been told as soon as they hear any sort of a theory outside of what they've been told, the immediately call, quackery and this.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       But it's, it's a weird knee jerk reaction to something, especially when you talk about asteroids, that is a very real part of our past. We have a ton of evidence. I mean there's actual craters that you can look at on earth. The moon, which has no atmosphere is littered with them. And if we look at the moon as a model for what could possibly have happened to earth, or at least you know, some of them, obviously with the moon having no atmosphere, it's going to get hit a lot more than we are. But still, and I mean this is a very real situation that this, this solar system, you know, it was, was at least as far as we know the only, so it was solar system has to deal with this. But we know this is a, this is a real issue. I mean we've seen impacts which like you just said, on one hand you have earth scientists looking at the earth and what they're realizing is that the earth is pockmarked with scars in each of these scars represents a tremendously powerful catastrophe, has happened in the history of the earth now that's accepted by mainstream science that that major catastrophes have happened in the history of the earth.

Speaker 1:          00:09:48       But where this thing now is about to come full circle is the recognition that these kinds of catastrophes of also influenced the rise and fall of civilization and a lot more, um, a lot more extremely than, than has been recognized up to this point. And while geologists and neuroscientists, scientists are looking at the surface of the earth in realizing that, um, etched into the surface of the earth are imprinted into the surface of the earth, are hundreds of scars of which are undoubtedly are only a small percentage of the total that exist. At the same time, astronomers are looking out into near space and discovering that we cohabitate space with a lot of stuff. It's not as empty as we thought. And just within the last six or seven weeks, we've had two close flybys of previously undiscovered that have previously undiscovered asteroids. This is the plank is NASA keeps saying, well there's, you know, there's, we've counted 1,650 asteroids and none of them are going to hit the earth in the next hundred years.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       Well, yeah, that's true. But what about all the ones they haven't counted, which are estimated to run into hundreds of thousands in which haven't been seen yet. And what happens is we see them roughly 10 days before they passed the earth. That is not enough time to do anything about them. But we have time if we're prepared to be rational and reasonable as a civilization to take care of this issue. Now when you're dealing with hundreds of thousands of near Earth objects that are flying around, like what? What are the things that could be done to protect earth? You can paint. It's low tech. Actually you can paint one side of the asteroid effect. It's Albido so that the sun's rays push differentially on one side rather than the other. That will shift. It's all bits slightly. It has to be calculated. You can give it a little knock with, uh, with, with a, a Rockett.

Speaker 1:          00:11:26       Basically, you don't want to blow it up. You don't want to turn, you know, your one big piece of artillery shell into Buckshot. You don't want to do that. You want to, you want to move it into a safer orbit. You can mount jets on it. People are looking now to mining asteroids, of course, are our society always goes, I civilization always goes for the where, where the, where the money's to be made. But if we can mine asteroids, we can move as to relates. And, and the technology is there. And ironically, the most dangerous asteroids are going to be the ones

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       that are the closest to the earth, which are the most accessible. And the asteroids pretty much have unbelievable amounts of resources on them. I mean, pretty much everything that is being mined on the earth can be found in asteroids from the hydrocarbons to precious metals to all of these things. And we're not that far away from technologically being able to actually, you know, mount expeditions to asteroids and mind them. And that's, that's the, the um, you know, that's the solution I kind of prefer because again, these things are tremendous sources of reese, of, of, of all kinds of things that would be usable to an expanding civilization. And, um, we could feasibly within a decade or two be mining asteroids and again, the ones that are the easiest access are also going to be the ones that are more dangerous because they're the ones that are coming to closest to the earth. So,

Speaker 2:          00:12:49       and add another point here is that there is one specific danger. There's one specific if you like, region of the sky that really needs to be looked at and this is, this is the region of the sky. This is why I wrote magicians of the gods because because of this discovery that there's a thing called the taurid meteor stream, which is 30 million kilometers wide and which envelops the solar system and the earth on its orbit around the sun passes through the Taurid meteor stream twice a year. Turns out the Taurid meteor stream is the debris of a giant comment that came in to the inner solar system about 20,000 years ago. That thing was at least a hundred kilometers in diameter according to their calculations if may have been more so. And then like other comments like shoemaker, Levy nine which spectacularly hit Jupiter in 1994 it began to break up into multiple fragments and those carry on orbiting on the original path, which and as they break up more and more, they degrade and small bits and large bits break off and it gradually fills up a kind of huge hoop of debris that the earth is passing through twice a year.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       It takes us 12 days to pass through it. We do two and a half million kilometers a day on our orbital path, 12 days to get through the Taurid meteor stream and the scientists of of the comic research group have made the point that a big object out of the Taurid meteor stream multiple objects as a matter of fact, was what hit the North American ice cap 12,800 years ago. It looks like there was a second series of impacts 11,600 years ago from the same source. It looks like there were other impacts in the bronze age. The most recent, almost definite impact out of the Taurid meteor stream was Tunguska in Siberia back in 1,908 that hit on the 30th of June 1,908 and that's at the peak of the torrid June shower. When we pass through the Tory, it's in June and in November. And what they're saying is we really need to focus on this story of meteor stream.

Speaker 2:          00:14:44       Their calculations are that there are hundreds and hundreds of massive objects in that Taurid meteor stream and you as a comet breaks up into bits. It becomes those bits become asteroids and those asteroids are circling in the Taurid meteor stream. And I've likened it to strapping on a blindfold and crossing an eight lane interstate twice a year and just hoping that we don't hit any heavy traffic, you know, that we meet bicycles or motorcycles rather than rather than trucks. But the trucks are out there. And what the common research group scientists are saying is we need now to be in depth investigating the Taurid meteor stream because it appears to be the hidden hand in human civilization. It is wiped out episodes of our history in the past and there's no reason to expect that it won't do so again unless we do something about it because the remnants of that original giant comment are still circling in the Tory of media stream and they are fucking dangerous.

Speaker 2:          00:15:38       Now, how is this being received in mainstream science? I mean is there any resistance to this because it seems like this is all pretty straightforward and in traceable Mosley being ignored, mostly being ignored. I think that is why scientists who have a vested interest in other ideas, first of all, there's a vested interest in not admitting that cataclysms are important at all. This goes right back to really to the 19th century when science began to take shape in the form that we know it now and they wanted to separate themselves off understandably from superstition. So they didn't want anything to do with something that sounds like the biblical flood, for example. They felt they would be contaminated by that and they preferred to explain any cataclysmic evidence as a result of gradual processes. So you really think it's because of the reluctance to accept religion or religious ideas or to to separate themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:16:29       I think that was the, that's where it starts, where it started to separate them ourselves off from that. Now they've gone a long way from that. And many, many scientists have got a vested interest in what is called uniformitarianism more gradualism and they, they don't like to hear about cataclysms having any major impact on the story of life on earth. So is it sort of the, the momentum of these initial, uh, desires to escape religious influence that have sort of led them down this path? Yes. And then there are others who have a vested interest in current accounts of global warming and there's others who have a vested interest in extinctions taking place. Now they want to say that our ancestors were responsible for the extinction of all the mammoths and mastodons and so on and so forth. Whereas the comment research group scientists are saying no, those huge mega fauna of North America were wiped out as a result of the massive series of impacts on the North American ice cap.

Speaker 2:          00:17:17       I'm reading a book right now by Dan Flores. Really interesting book called Coyote America. He's a wildlife historian and he, uh, is really an expert on all the different forms of wildlife in North America where they originated, where they migrated to. And one of the more fascinating things about it is he's talking about all these animals that went extinct, you know, 10,000 plus years ago, this mass extinction event and never once does he bring up cataclysms. And there's all these different, uh, is different ideas. And one of the big ones being that human beings with Adam [inaudible], which is like really a very weird

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       sort of a spear throwing device and wiped out the wooly mammoths and all these other animals and Tummy tuck posture, lunatic idea. I'll see if you have any contact with hunter gatherer as today. You find that a hunter gatherer peoples don't overkill that game. They, they hunt them respectfully, they take what they need and they leave the rest because it's a renewable resource for them. So I don't think hunter gatherers wiped out the mammoths in North America. The evidence is compelling. It was the comment, well, the evidence that you brought up when you were here the first time, when you showed the images of all those mammoths that had been literally knocked over with broken legs from the impact of something mass burial grounds, like these mass, not burial grounds obviously, but mass casualties mortality. So it's a good way of putting it. That's a good way of putting it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:37       Yeah. In fact, grandma, I visited one up in South Dakota called hot springs where there's just several dozen, nobody knows how many are actually there, but there's at least several dozen, uh, two species, woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths that have been in tuned. And, um, while we were there, I interestingly, I, you know, the, the guide, the woman giving us the tour there was kind of giving the a gradualist explanation. Well, over long periods of time, these mammoths wandered into a sinkhole and we're too dumb to get out. And so they became in tuned and I asked the question, well, what studies have been done on the sedimentary matrix in which their remains are being found? Um, because as I'm looking at this sedimentary matrix, I'm seeing a massive deposit. In other words, a deposit that was instantaneous, instantaneous. And when I brought that up, she actually got very irritated and Miley, they all got dismissed.

Speaker 3:          00:19:32       My question didn't, um, you know what, we've got it all worked out. You know, we, we, we know about that. Well, what is it? Well, we've got it all worked out and then immediately went on with her, but yet I had an article that was actually written by one of the original scientists or worked under site, and he, he, his description was, well, it could have been that, but also as an alternative. And he used the term bloat and float that what you had was wooly mammoths that had been caught in a flood, drowned, and they're bloated carcasses floated into a depression in the landscape, and that's where they were in tuned. And that makes a whole lot more sense to me then the fact that, you know, individually, over several thousand years, these in these mammoths wandered into this sinkhole and then couldn't get out. Um, but you've got to bear in mind we're, we're talking about, you know, at the end of the last ice age, 120 roughly species of megafauna disappeared, which is about equivalent to the same number of megafauna.

Speaker 3:          00:20:30       Species didn't habits. The Earth today was a short period of time, was something like 65% of the north American mammals when extinct 75 per 75%. Yep. Very short period of time, very short period of time, but pretty much totally coincident with that period called the younger dryas. And so there's nothing what we're capable of doing today. Back then, I mean, when you look at human extinction events, human cause extinction events, well, it's very logical. And what we're doing today with pollution and the expanse of civilization and weapons are a super sophisticated. If we wanted to, we could wipe out a lot of different species. But what we're actually seeing is that at the end of what's called the Bowling Alley Rod, which was the gradual warming at the end of the last ice age that preceded the sudden catastrophic change at 12,800, was it the clovis culture that existed for three to 500 years, I think somewhere, but they suddenly were gone.

Speaker 3:          00:21:25       Right, exactly. Simultaneous with the mammoths. And then there are interesting studies that are coming out now showing that at least continental wide, there was apparently a major human population crash. Exactly coincident with the Megafauna extinctions because you had quarries that had been mined for centuries that are suddenly abandoned. You have campsites that had been, uh, that had generations of, of, uh, debris and in tool kits accumulating and so on debris from the, from the, the, the fluting of the, the spear points and so on that are suddenly abandoned. Right. So the evidence actually suggests that the human population crashed, which would certainly imply that they would have been far less capable of wiping out all of these species of Megafaun. Also the, the studies of their, their diet and their lifeways suggest that they were very quite diverse. They were hunter gatherers and they focus mostly on small game. They ate a lot of fish, a lot of shellfish. They gathered food. And why would they go after the biggest, most dangerous animal, you know, in the end, the whole, um, and the whole array of, of animal

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       and with incredible efficiency, hunt them to extinction in a hundred years. It doesn't make sense. No, it makes no sense. And it seems pretty silly. It, and especially from that time of her may say rattled mentioned the clovis culture. This is for a very long time, really until just a couple of years ago, all of the mainstream academics in the fields of archeology and anthropology were saying there were no human beings in North America before, let's say 13,000 years ago, give or take 500 years. They came across the bering land bridge. The Bering Strait at that time was above water. Sea level was lower. They entered the Americas then they weren't hit there before. Now in the last two to three years, there's just been a whole raft of new scientific research and no scientist today is prepared to defend the clovis model anymore. It's accepted, of course, that have been human beings in America for fifty thousand sixty thousand years, and there's weird genetic links, like for example, there's a trace that connects aboriginal Australians with North Americans. They had a common ancestor. It's a very peculiar thing that's going on, and so what happens is that actually the scientific models which constrain and restrict research for so long do get overthrown and that clovis model is being overthrown

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       and what the missing piece of the puddle puzzle, I think for everybody working in this field is the cataclysm. The comment, what happened between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago, which changed everything? Is it be bizarre to you guys or frustrating in any way that this is not a mainstream idea? This is, this is very much fringe, but yet it's, it's not something that we don't have any evidence. Whenever, whenever I put out a book, I'm immediately, there's this, there's this huge hostile reactions. The Michael Shermer thing, like the Michael Shermer thing. I mean, I would say magicians of the gods, which I published it in 2015 which deals with his whole comedy issue is actually the most thoroughly documented, the most thoroughly referenced book that I've ever written. It's calm, it's measured. They actually don't read it. They just say, oh, Hancock's brought out another book. He's a pseudo scientists. That's what they always call me, or a pseudo archaeologist. Um, and, and it's obviously rubbish because it disagrees with everything that we know. Well, that's the point of the heretic in society is to offer an alternative view and, and, and well documented evidence. But it seems that we're dealing with such a deeply ingrained mindset, which is connected in curious ways to power structures in our society that it's very difficult to change it

Speaker 3:          00:24:57       absolutely. In, in, in here. Like Greg mentioned earlier, there's kind of a, it went from a religious motive I think in the 19th century and now it's more a political motive. And again, the idea that every day you'll find something, you know, coming from various factions that or we're destroying the earth and the earth has never suffered this kind of, you know, assault on it before and, and you know, we're causing the sixth great mass extinction and we're going to cause catastrophic global warming if we pump another 50 or a hundred parts per million of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. And, and so what that has done is like many, I won't say many, but several of the scientists now that have been in the forefront of criticizing the younger dryas impact hypothesis are also very much involved in the global warming movement. And the idea that we are now precipitating the sixth grade mass extinction having looked now at, at mass extinctions and been really an obsession of mine for about 30 years now. I've looked at everything from the cretaceous tertiary that the Permian Triassic, you know, right on down the line to the most recent one, which to me is really in some ways the most interesting because the most recent mass extinction that we're talking about is the one that took place. While we humans, we're, we're a part of the, of the story and

Speaker 4:          00:26:20       between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago, the younger Dryas,

Speaker 3:          00:26:24       yes, the younger dryas, which is still an unexplained climate anomaly that happened. Um, and I mentioned this I think in previous broadcasts it's, you know, what you had was you had to spasm of, of extreme warming followed by rapid shifting into extreme cold, literally within a matter of a few. And

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       we're talking about um, climate changes that are up to 15 degrees Fahrenheit within perhaps one to five years, which utterly dwarfs anything that we've experienced in the last, since the industrial revolution began. And we still don't really understand. And that's why this research is so important because now we understand that there was something cosmic that happened. It's left its imprint in the landscape over what, four continents, five continents now of a over 50 million square kilometers of the Earth's surface is a Gi giant debris field of their stuff that is only produced by massive impacts. These things come in at 70,000 miles an hour and you know if they have any diameter at all, if they're, if they're a hundred meters or more in, in diameter, they are, they are going to hit the earth really hard. They're not going to burn up in the atmosphere. And when they do, they pack a huge amount of kinetic energy, a huge amount of heat and shock.

Speaker 4:          00:27:42       And that creates very definite chemical products. So nano diamonds, so carbons, fareol's, so melt glass, let's like the trinity site that was produced in nuclear explosions. All of these, when they're all found together in the same layer of soil, and when you can put a date on that layer of soil and when it's all over the world, there's only one thing can explain them, a massive cosmic it. I don't understand why this is controversial. I really don't. I mean I do. I understand it because I know that once people start teaching things and once people start doing lectures and giving speeches, they want to stick to their guns and they want to, they want to somehow or another avoid anything that's going to contradict what what they've been espousing. It's gay. This is a game changer. This information, it changes everything. It changes the way we've looked at our past.

Speaker 4:          00:28:28       It changes the whole story of archeology and it changes the way we're going to look at the future. I think that people in academia are reluctant to embrace that change and they're afraid of being called pseudo scientists because there's a whole lobby of skeptics who use this word pseudo scientist or a pseudo archeologist as an instant dismissal of other ideas and those who are in the profession, they don't want to get tarred with that brush. They want to keep themselves clean and can understand that. But you're talking about hard evidence. Yeah. You're talking about this nuclear glass. You're talking about nano diamonds. You're talking about core samples that show this massive shift when you do the ice core samples, massive shift in temperature, and you're talking about a very clear evidence of impacts that we know exist. It's not like a calm, it's a theory.

Speaker 4:          00:29:12       It's not like it's big foot or something like, you know, like what we're looking for. The final piece of evidence that shows that comma is a real thing. Exactly. It's real. It's totally, it's totally, it's totally real. But it's so difficult for those who are invested in other models to accept and unfortunately they have the ear of the media. It's the, it's uh, there are all, by the way, all the scientists in the comic comic research group are absolutely mainstream scientists and they have taken a lot of flack from their colleagues for even daring to investigate this area. Why they've had no

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       funding. They've had to fund themselves. That is so crazy because this is not a controversial thing in my mind. It shouldn't be. It should not be. This is not an airy fairy thing. We're not talking about psychics. We're not talking about Ufos. Were were talking about something we know exists, so to bury your head in the sand over something like this seems to me vested interests tested interest right now. Now say spending the equivalent of a one attack helicopter a year on investigating the comets and asteroids danger, you know, $50 million a year. That's not that much. It's peanuts. It's a tiny, it's a minuscule, some hundreds of billions of dollars on on massive sophisticated military equipment, which we can use to slaughter one another in evermore sophisticated ways, but just $50 million a year on saving the earth from, from a potential cataclysm that could put our civilization back into the stone age tomorrow.

Speaker 2:          00:30:33       And I don't mean to keep harping on Michael Shermer because I liked Michael, but he, he highlights this sort of natural inclination to poke fun at something that he has done no research on whatsoever. When I pointed out, go back Lee Tappi and I sent him some articles from national geographic, he went radio silent. I mean cause just like he should know about it. It's astonishing. The number of people will mocking it. Yeah, you're going to mock it. You should actually know what you're mocking. And to say that, go back to the tempe was created by Hud together as well. I'm sorry. That's just a theory. That's not it. That's not a fact that you have a sophisticated site with astronomical alignments with hundreds and hundreds of megalithic pillars weighing up to 20 tons each. The world's first perfectly aligned north south building, which you can only do with astronomy.

Speaker 2:          00:31:21       This is, it's not enough to say, oh, they were just hunter gatherer is there was something as strong from a half a mile away. Yeah. I mean there's, there's some serious sophistication. I mean, what, how big were these stones? Well, the, the biggest one actually still in the quarry, they left it because it had a fault in it. They clearly intended to move it 50 tons. You're looking at 20 foot high objects and they, and then it's the, it's the putting together of them. See, here's the problem. Hunter gatherer societies are not the kinds of societies that produce large scale fixed monuments. Why? Because they don't generate a surplus. You can't pay for somebody to become an architect and four of those times somebody to come and astronomy, you'd busy hunting and gathering and that's what you do. Agriculture generates a surplus and that's the, that is the problem at Gabelli Tapi because there is no background. This site just appears out of nowhere, a midst what appears to be a hunter, gather a community. But what they're not considering is the possibility. We're looking at a technology transfer that the survivors of a lost civilization who already had all that knowledge came to go back, Lee Tepi and use that site as a center of initiation to teach the local hunter gatherer is how to do agriculture and that's now taken as the beginnings of civilization. I would say it is the reinvention or the re making of civilization. So when we're looking at Summa,

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       there are any artifacts we find ancient Mesopotamia and that area of Iraq. Those are the people that are sort of reinventing and relearning.

Speaker 2:          00:32:49       Well that that's hence all those. They, when we talk of Mesopotamia, which means between two rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates go Beckley. Tempe is sitting right there in the headwaters between the Tigris and Euphrates. And we cannot separate that from the later cultures that enter history five thousand six thousand years ago. They're part of the lineage that descended from Gore Beckley, Tempe Times. And what's fascinating about Gabelli Tempe is the way it doesn't fit the way. There's no background to it that you would expect to see them practicing learning architectural skills. The oldest stuff should be the worst. And as they carry on, it gets better. That site ran for a thousand years. The best stuff is the oldest. A thousand years later, what they were producing wasn't so good. This is a real anomaly and it needs to be investigated, not mocked by skeptics, but actually explore to consider maybe this does rock the whole paradigm. And it's kind of ironic

Speaker 3:          00:33:38       that in their desire to get away from the ancient myths and tales in the Bible, they've ignored those ancient myths and tales, which all talk about cataclysms. Well, part of our modern psychology is to imagine that we are somehow so far advanced from our predecessors that we now represent the pinnacle of civilization. And anything to proceeded us has to be looked upon almost is as if the, the workings of children. It requires a major psychological shift to admit or accept that our ancestors who may have been far, far more sophisticated than, than we had imagined in our 19th century models, which basically still dominate thinking today. And, um, you know, in Graham's book he devotes several chapters to the story of one 19th or 20th century heretic. J Harlan Brett's in his story to me, kind of encapsulates the whole, the whole process of forcing this paradigm shift.

Speaker 3:          00:34:37       And for years he was out there exploring this evidence that there had been this tremendous flooding in, uh, in, in Washington state. And all of his critics were dismissive without ever even going out and looking at the evidence firsthand in the field. But what he did was he stuck to his guns for three decades and continued to amass evidence to the point where they just couldn't, they couldn't dismiss it anymore. And finally, um, a group of them went out, um, and began to explore the, the, the landscapes for themselves in one of the leaders. I think you talked about it in your book, James Gillooly, who was sort of the leader of the skeptic faction that had set out their sole purpose was to discredit and lay this whole flood heresy to rest once and for all. But he went out into field and they spent about eight days in the field where he's seeing this evidence for himself over and over again.

Speaker 3:          00:35:33       And when you're looking at just one piece of it, you might be able to say, okay, there's all other explanations for that. But what happens is when you get multiple lines of evidence all converging, and there's no way to individually explain a way each one of those things, other than just saying, oh, well it's all coincidence. He, this James Gillooly was honest enough so that after a week out there, they were at a place called palouse falls in southern Washington, which was one of these areas where these tremendous inland tsunami swept across the land. Um, and I actually just visited there about eight weeks ago when I took a group of people out there and, and, and took them to palouse falls to show them right on the spot where James Gillooly was standing when he finally had his epiphany. Do you have any images of that that you brought with us?

Speaker 3:          00:36:21       I have images. I can dig them up here. Yeah, I sure do. Yeah. I've got some really interesting images to show you. Um, which relates because see this flooding stuff relates directly to the idea of the impact and we can get into a little bit of that, um, explaining how, how these parallel lines of, of evidence are now converging. But the interesting thing about, but Gillooly was that in the, in the, uh, uh, descriptions of, of the trip, he wandered off by himself for a long time away from the group. And we're standing here looking at this massive cataract with 400 foot cliffs in this little tiny ribbon of water flowing over it in this huge canyon below it and these big boulders. And he'd seen for a whole week he'd been seeing this stuff. And it finally got to the point where it was undeniable and he walked back to the group and the words out of his mouth verbatim where, how could I have been so wrong?

Speaker 3:          00:37:19       And he finally admitted. And at that that was like a turning point. And now, and again, Graham describes it's very effectively in the book how in a, in a way the flooding phenomena was hijacked and then placed within this more gradual listic context, um, to, to really to avoid the fact that it was something so anomalous in, so such a departure from our modern experience that we had to look outside of our modern experience to find an explanation. What they wanted to do was find something within our modern experience. And this is the cornerstone of the uniformitarian a approach is that we look for a modern example and then we extrapolate backwards from that. And so what they did was they saw, well in, in the modern term, in the modern world, we have pro glacial lakes lake, that's that form in front of glaciers.

Speaker 3:          00:38:09       And sometimes these pro glacial lakes might be held in by uh, an ice dam or another glacier. These ice dams will give away and they will cause pretty catastrophic flooding. They're very common up in Iceland because you've got several volcanoes under the Wioa, the Icelandic ice sheets. And up there they use the term Yoga Lopes to describe these outburst floods. But here's the thing, when you look at the modern versions of it, you basically are looking at floods that are less than 1000th of one single flow from these floods we're talking about. That happened, you know, 12 and 13,000 years ago, 1000 less than a thousandth less than a thousand then peak discharge and in total volume. And, and so in his been admitted in several places, I've extracted the quotes saying, well, we do admit that this is a major extrapolation upwards, but nevermind. Yeah, you know, her

Speaker 4:          00:39:05       mind is so disturbing me. See Holland breaths for for 30 years was walking the walk and the channel scab lands. And what he saw was evidence for, um, as he called it, a humongous flood, which, which actually rosen fall within fell within three weeks. And, and he went through decades of being put aside by his colleagues in salted. They mocked him, they laughed at him just as the skeptics do today. But gradually the evidence began to Matt and they couldn't deny it anymore that there had been, there had been flooding. And actually eventually they gave Harlan Brett's j Harlan, Brett's the penrose metal, which is the ultimate, you know, uh, the ultimate bestowal of, of geology in America. He got the accolade and he said it, that he was born more than 90 years old at that time. And he said at that time, he said, all my enemies are dead, so I have no one left a gloat over.

Speaker 4:          00:39:54       Um, but, but the point is, in a way, there was nothing to gloat about because what they did was they, they, they separated him from his central idea. Instead of accepting that there had been one huge flood. And that was always his view. They said, oh, there must have been 70 or 80 floods that caused all this damage. And that's what we're, that's what we are seriously challenging right now. It's so ironic in a way that the human desire for knowledge is what has led us to where we are today. We have this insatiable desire for knowledge and for innovation, but that same human desire to achieve is also what, what's the, is responsible for that and the ego blocks anything that's contrary to what you've already established as fact. Exactly. As soon as you see something that might throw a monkey wrench into the gears of what you've been teaching and practicing your whole life.

Speaker 4:          00:40:45       And I know that you've gone through this with Egypt, you're your whole issue with the Sphinx and with a doctor shock. And John Anthony West who was on the podcast last one was with you just recently. Yeah, he's amazing. By the way, I'm going to be doing, uh, an event in New York with John Anthony West and on the 29th of November where, uh, it's, well, it's, it's, again, it's linked on my website. The details are on the talks and events page. It's in, it's in some church somewhere, but I'm going to give a presentation and then I'm going to interview John Live on live on stage. First Time I've ever done that. I'm kind of, podcasting is such a character. He's an amazing dude and um, magical Egypt is, I think one of the most important things that anybody could ever watch. I think that DVD series is just insane. It's so spectacular and so fantastic. And next to going to Egypt without, which I haven't done. I think that's probably the second best thing. Just bet you bet. And John

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       is an example of why we need heretics. This is, this is the thing, you see that, that the science today, yes, you're right. We have this thirst for knowledge and it's k human characteristic, but also we get invested in particular positions and when people criticize those positions, we take it as an existential threat and where we get all angry and hot and bothered about it. If we allow that to happen too much, we don't keep a place for heretics in our society, then we're never going to do anything novel. We are gradually going to get locked down ossified into the, into the existing system we need heretics. John has been the leading heretic on ancient Egypt for decades. Pointing out that we should listen to what the ancient Egyptians said, that their civilization was not a development, it was a legacy. It was a legacy from the time of the gods and that cost me back again to this whole issue of a lost civilization.

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       Now when God Bagley, tabby was discovered, it vindicated you in so many ways, but what are the possibilities, if any, of more of these sites being explored and exposed? A few. Are there, are there more that people are looking at right now? Are there any that are under the radar? Just a year ago at the bottom of the Sicily channel at a depth of more than 120 feet. It's been underwater for at least 9,000 years is a huge megalithic sites. Before the discovery of go Beckley Tepi, that site could never have been explained. The dating is absolutely definite. The seas rose and covered it at least 9,000 years ago. We don't know how long it stood there before it was covered by the rising seas. But there it sits under water. And I think underwater discoveries or, and I've had a part to play in this over the years, are, are one of the ways forward.

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       We need to look at those areas because there was a 400 foot rise in sea level. At the end of the ice age. You're looking at the amount of land that would be put together in, say, Europe and China added together. That amount of land was swallowed by those rising seas. And archeology has largely proceeded without taking account of those lost lands. I'm not saying they haven't looked at all, but they're primarily in marine archeology interested in shipwrecks. Now this, uh, this megalithic site is their images of this that we could look at. There are, yeah. Yeah. I can, I can probably find it, um, a monolith at the bottom of the Sicily channel. Try that. Try that. A search on that. Pull that up, Jamie.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       But, um, so what does this look like? Is this, and this has been clearly established that this actually is the work of man. This is not some sort of a Yardang or something. Of course there's dispute. Of course, the mainstream is not going to just accept this overnight, but again, it's mainstream scientists are funded. They're absolutely certain that they're dealing with a manmade site. There are holes drilled through these megaliths. Uh, one of them is very, very large. There's a series of other megaliths round about, it's not a natural thing. So here we're looking at some of her, right? Yeah. So there's that big, big megalith broken into two parts right there. Oh Wow. Yeah. And, and, and this, we can say often with archeological sites, the problem is dating them. You know, for example, there are incredible megalithic temples all over the island of Malta, not far away from this place.

Speaker 2:          00:44:36       Incredible megalithic temples, but they can't date the stone directly. They have to date organic material associated with the stone and that can give them misleadingly young dates. In a case of a site that's been covered by sea level rise, there can be no argument. Nobody went down there and built that 9,000 years ago. It had to be built before the seas rose and that puts a minimum age on it of 9,000 years. What are the best images that we can look at it? Cause right now I'm just seeing rocks. It's very difficult cause I'm looking at something that I mentioned and I'm afraid that's all you're going to see. Those are, those are the best images of it that exists over one right above that. That's Indiana Goonie. That's that. That's not in, that's not in the Sicily channel. So, um, what, what are the biggest pieces down there?

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       Is it this right here? Is this what yeah, that big thing. Big thing there is 30 feet long I think. And is it, what, what leads you to believe that this is manmade? The scientists who worked on it, the fact that there are holes drilled through the stone, the fact that you can go to neighboring areas like Armenia and find Brealey, very ancient megalithic sites where they have exactly the same kind of holes drilled through the stones and the whole seem to have been used for astronomical sightings. Now this sites a mass, it's been knocked over by the sea. It's fallen down, but we're seeing the same thing. Big megaliths with holes drilled through them. And you're also dealing with 9,000 plus years of erosion and barnacle grows all of that. And the ocean is a difficult place to work. You know, it's, it's a, it's, it does, it's not easy. Visibility can be bad. You're dealing with currents. There's all kinds of, all kinds of problems because this is the important just cubs, cameron and his crazy little summary in ringing James Cameron. Well I spent seven years scuba diving all around the world looking at this stuff. And you know, it's pretty convincing in my view. Well

Speaker 3:          00:46:20       it is. It does make sense that if we do know for a fact and we do that the sea level rose dramatically at the end of the ice age, it makes sense that some things would be buried under the water. Well in, during the Ice Age, whatever, you know, you don't have to talk about advanced civilizations or anything, but during the ice age, living under coastlines in establishing your villages, communities and everything under coastlines would've been probably one of the most benign places, um, to get, you know, because for one thing, you're, you're down, you're see the sea level of this presence of the c's is going to, uh, you know, smooth out the climate and so forth. So, you know, you're going to have mold. Probably most cultural development during the ice age is going to be close to this, to the sea. So it's going to be underwater now, just like grandma's was talking about.

Speaker 3:          00:47:06       Um, and so this to me is probably the future of archeology is marine archeology where a lot of discoveries are going to be made. And, and that particular thing, I mean there's a lot of megalithic structures around the world that if you set that thing up like this and put those siding holes through it, um, would, would look precisely like scrape the barnacles off of it, you know, and, and no one's saying, oh, it's proven, but what it is is we have to keep an open mind and say, well, there are some very strong similarities here, so let's investigate this thing further. And that's the whole point of all this is all of this stuff needs more research. It doesn't need some cavalier dismissal by somebody who's, you know, protecting their own paradigm. It needs more research on all fronts. I mean, because I think that there's enough evidence that has now accumulated to suggest that there is a deep history to the human species on earth and we're just beginning to really appreciate how much deeper it really is.

Speaker 3:          00:48:04       Then the conventional models of history and rather than just waving an arm and dismissing this, um, with a skeptical sneaker with a skeptical sneer. Exactly. Oh, it's interesting is that there is an accepted scientific models of humanity when you're talking about supervolcanoes, right, like the Super Volcano of 60 70,000 years ago. Yeah. I mean they're, they pretty much accept that that wiped out of the vast majority of human beings on earth. And why is the super volcano hypothesis so easily accepted? But yet the asteroidal impact, I mean, both of them are real events. Both of them are historically documented. In fact, we really don't, we've never watched a supervolcano take over the world, but we've seen asteroids hit other planets. We've actually watched shoemaker Levy, like you were talking about before, we call them bonding Jupiter. Unbelievable. Bigger impact in the planet earth itself. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:48:57       exactly. Exactly. So, yeah, and actually more than 20 impacts each, each, each one of them would have wiped out all life on earth if that, if that object at hit the earth. Yeah. So, you know, so it's a, it's a, it's another thing to when we were talking about underwater structures, but let's also consider the possibility, and again, John Anthony West work is important here. Let's also considered the possibility that we have miss identified a number of structures that are standing in plain view like the Great Sphinx Egyptology read any age of logical text, any encyclopedia. Actually they will tell you that thing was put there by a specific pharaoh, Pharaoh carfrae of the fourth dynasty round about 2,500 BC. That is not a fact that is an opinion, but it's presented as a fact. There is not a single inscription that relates the Sphinx to that fair or not a contemporary inscription, not one dating from 2,500 BC.

Speaker 2:          00:49:51       Um, in fact, there's nothing at all. It's just the assumption because it's close to a pyramid which they assume the same fair are built. Again on the absence of evidence that the Sphinx must have been built by them. But John Anthony West was the first to see that. Actually when we look at this thing, we we're looking at a highly eroded stone object and that erosion is very odd and that's why he brought professor Robert Schoch, professor of geology from Boston University to Giza in 1992 to look at the Sphinx. And say what actually caused this weathering on the Sphinx and shock immediately saw it, what caused it was exposure to a very long period of heavy, heavy, heavy rainfall and no such rains have fallen in Egypt in the last 5,000 years, but they did fall during the younger dryas. We had a prolonged rain out from this comet impact.

Speaker 2:          00:50:39       As that ice cap was pulverized and a massive amount of ice water was thrown up into the upper atmosphere, prolonged grainer, which could have been the cause of the erosion on the Sphinx. Now, what has occurred, knew what discoveries have been discovered in the last year. Like what, what is new that we can look at the, in terms of archeology, there's not much new, um, go back. Lee Tempe at the moment is in deep freeze. It's right 30 miles from the Syrian border. There's been massive unrest, unrest in Shenandoah, which is the main town archeology is very difficult for them to carry on their space, basically just frozen where they just sort of stopped. They've just kind of stopped, you know, and in fact, there's amazing number of these of these sites. And other sites that I visited for magicians of the gods was Baalbek in the Lebanon.

Speaker 2:          00:51:30       Absolutely stunning sight and again, I'm convinced that that site is nuanced. It is, yes, there is a rub temple there, but they put that temple there because the site was sacred long before and there's this incredible u shaped megalithic wall which surrounds Baalbek, which does not appear to have any connection to the, to the Roman structure at at, at all. Again, that's an area which is subject to tremendous unrest and difficult and it's difficult for archaeologists to proceed, but just just in 2014 they, they made a huge new discovery at Baalbek cover buried block, which weighs 1,460 tons which was sitting there on the site. They've been working on that site for 100 years. They only found it in 2014 1000 tons. What? 1,460 times that 2 million pounds. Is that what that is? I don't know. Maybe it was math is better than mine and converting it into power

Speaker 5:          00:52:25       2000 pounds, 2000 pounds to a, to a turn to an imperial ton, so whatever, and add three zeros on it, doubled it and add three zeros on it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       It's a horrendous amount of pounds, put it that way. It's the single largest block of stone ever cut and it in the ancient world. And they found this just in 2014 found in 2014 now there's another big one right beside it, which has been in plain view for about the last hundred years and it's astonishing to me that this one, which is just below it was covered by sediment.

Speaker 5:          00:52:54       We have an actual calculator. You might be the only person unless I never go anywhere without my calculator. We'll calculator. Nobody has one of those. We were just talking about that yesterday. We were like, who the fuck is an actual guy can carry one. Wow. So Baalbek was also the site of a, I mean there, there's many mountain model lists that have been discovered there and it's a really fascinating site that most many people have sort of overlooked. When you talk about ancient structures in the past, I have to resist. I, I've got nothing against

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       aliens, but I don't need aliens to explain these things. Um, I think a much, a much leaner and more elegant explanation for these huge archeological anomalies is a lost human civilization much better. That's been the case that I've been making for pr for 25 years. I think that the alien thing is a bit of a distraction for, of course there's aliens. Of course the universe is full of life, but the ancient archeological sites are not good evidence for that idea that they're very, unless you massage the evidence a lot, they're not good evidence. I think we are dealing with a lost human civilization and at Baalbek 20 feet above the ground, we have three blocks of stone joined so closely together that you can't get it edge of a sheet of paper between them. Each one weighs more than 900 tons and they are 20 feet above the ground. The stunning, it's a stunning achievement. It's just absolutely astonishing. How on earth did they do that? How does mainstream archeology deal with that? They say are the Romans built it all? Oh the Romans. The Romans did it. The Romans did do some awesome stuff. They did do some awesome stuff. They absolutely did. But this site is separate from the Roman site. Its surrounds it, but it's not part of it in my view.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       In terms of your question, what's happened within the last year or two, I would think that probably the most significant thing or certainly right up there would be the the the comic research and the discovery. I mean like this article I have right here, which came out in 2014 so it's not that old. A Nano diamond rich layer across three continents consistent with major cosmic impact at 12,800 years ago and it's something like 24 25 highly pedigreed science

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       and these are the comic research group. These are the scientists from the call research group who have funded all their research themselves. They came out with another paper in 2015 where was this published? If anybody wants to read this? That's in the general of Glg. Yeah, but then there's the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences host a lot of their work as well, and the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences get into trouble for hosting their work, but they feel it's important so they keep on hosting it. This is so spectacularly confusing to me because that's rock solid science. This is evidence. This is actually, you can weigh this stuff. You can measure it. You can, you can run tests on it and find out what its components are. This to me is so baffling. Yeah, it's very baffling. They brought out another paper in 2015 I won't go into the some of the details that boring, but it's called a Basey and chronological analysis. And basically what they're, what they were looking at is it, they ask themselves, is it possible that this evidence, these nano diamonds, these melt glass, that carbon's failures could that have been laid down gradually and the chronological analysis that they've done absolutely answers that. No, it was not laid down gradually. This whole thing unfolded in a period of about 24 hours. Whoa. One at night.

Speaker 3:          00:56:15       Yeah. And what had happened, Joe, was that for years archeologists had recognized this a black matte layer at, at about two dozen or more of the clovis sites around North America, which there had been over 50 of them that have been studied. And it would see Vance Haynes who wrote an interesting paper saying that, um, that he was the one who noted that below this black matte layer, which is only two to three inches thick in most sites, you found evidence of the clovis culture. You found their tool kits in their, their, um, spear points. And so on. You found evidence of the extinct megafauna, but not above it. You would find this evidence of this cultural activity and the megafauna right up to the bottom of the, of the, um, black matte layer, but not above it. So what finally happened was in 2007, um, Richard firestone and Allen West and some of their colleagues, and it was just basically a small group at that point, took a look at this closer look, and that's when they began to discover these impact proxies, usually right at the base of the layer.

Speaker 3:          00:57:27       And the layer itself is carbonaceous, which suggests that there had been a lot of sick deposited, which would imply widespread wildfires factors. A study off the right off the coast of California here on the Santa Rosa Island is it pretty much concluded that there was just massive wildfires. It pretty much just in Ila, did everything. And in this was proceeded by the deposition of this black matte layer. And right at the bottom of this black matte layers where you find the nano diamonds, the magnetic grains, the microspheres roles, um, the carbonaceous spherials. Um, fullerenes you, you find these impact proxies and then are not all the same at all the sites. In fact, that's been one of the things that the critics of seized upon, but what they're doing is I think taking an oversimplified model and when you look at a comic fragmentation event, you could be looking at the individual pieces could be have very different compositions and what we were talking about earlier, the Taurid meteor stream.

Speaker 3:          00:58:25       I'm not convinced at this point that it was necessarily just a single impact event. It may have been a bombardment episode that may have lasted even several decades. It may have been ceased for a while and we were talking about this last night over dinner that there seems to be a second spasm at 11,600 years ago. That's also associated with a massive rise in sea level. They call a, there's two meltwater spikes, meltwater spike one a and meltwater spike one B. I'm quite convinced that these meltwater spikes that have been documented by marine geologists and oceanographers are correlated with these melting events of the ice sheet that I've been looking at in terms of their, their geomorphic, uh, um, consequences because some of these events, I mean, the only way I can describe some of these meltwater advances that the only modern analog to this would be a tsunami.

Speaker 3:          00:59:19       And we've seen some pretty devastating tsunamis within the last decade or two. Um, both in Indonesia and in Japan. And I don't know if you've ever seen any of that, like the videos of these tsunamis, anybody listening, it is definitely worthwhile to go online and look at some of these videos where you can actually see the, the unbelievably powerful effects of a, of a 30 or 40 or 50 foot tsunami right now, some of the landscapes, and I have a, um, some images we can pull up here shortly. Um, our places in Montana, Idaho, Washington where you literally had as tsunami sweeping over the land there was over a thousand feet deep and that tsunami came off the ice cap. And that that's not an oceanic tsunami. It's a freshwater tsunami. It's meltwater coming off this, this catastrophic melting of the ice sheet and I've traced the sources of some of these meltwater.

Speaker 3:          01:00:13       I've made two trips now up into the end of the plateau country of British Columbia looking for the source of this meltwater because in the conventional models now of the this flooding this that goes back to Harlan Brett's and basically what they've done is they said initially there could have been no flood because Harlan Brett's didn't provide a source for the water. They said, the critics said, well, you're saying that all of this evidence in the landscape is evidence of the flood, but what was the source of the flood? And he didn't have a source. So the crane and said, well, you don't have a source for the floodwater. Therefore the flood didn't take place. Then as, as the research evolved, you had independent evidence accumulating in western Montana by jt Pardee, who was with the US Geological Survey and he was investigating evidence that the mountain valleys of western Montana had been filled up with an enormous volume of water.

Speaker 3:          01:01:08       And this volume of water seemed to be exactly the same time as Brett's is floods. He then assumed that this was a giant lake. And because you can see in, and we can, I think we have some images, I think Jamie has some images, so we'll pull them up shortly. We're on a mountain side, you see to shorelines etched, you know, a thousand feet above the valley floor. And what he then decided was that based upon an old 19th century, uh, interpretation by TC chamberlain that there had been an ice dam. He said, well, there must have been an ice dam west of here somewhere in the Clark Fork Valley. A giant lake backed up, burst through the ice dam. And then this is what would have caused Harlan. Brett's is floods. So now the geological community is shifting because number one, the evidence is overwhelming and they can't deny it anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:02:00       But what they're doing is looking for a gradualist or a more uniformitarian explanation. So they immediately latched on to this. Well, there was a giant pro glacial or in front of a glacial lake, uh, in western Montana. Well, you're talking about somewhere between 520 and 550 cubic miles of water. That's a of water right in, in, in a, normally when you have a large lake, you have a huge catchment base and it is feeding lots of streams and rivers that are feeding into that lake. When you look at the, any of the big lakes around North America, you have the lake and then you have this big ole catchment basin and all of that's feeding in Lake Missoula. The whole lake fills almost the whole catchment basin. It's like, to me what they did was they said, okay, we're just going to push the source of the water from here over to here, but let's not go into the question of where did the water come from?

Speaker 3:          01:02:51       That's filling these mountain valleys of western Montana. And this is what I had. I spent a couple of weeks in September going up into some of these, following these valleys up into British Columbia. And they're spectacular evidence. And it's almost like the American geologists stop at the, at the 49th parallel, and they say, well, that's the Canadians, uh, preserve up there. We'll let them there. They've got their own theories. We've got ours. Interestingly, the Canadians are saying that we think that the water for these floods came from up here, but they don't like that because you see one of the leading geologists who, who, who's saying that these floods came from from Canada is John Shaw, who, who basically came up. There was this idea that drum Lynn's, which are these inverted bolt hole shaped land forms, they're found by hundreds of thousands, uh, in regions where, where glaciers were that they were formed, not by the glaciers grinding over the landscape, but they were actually formed by massive subglacial flows of water.

Speaker 3:          01:03:58       And his critics have all been saying, well, here's the problem. What's the source of your water? Therefore, it wasn't water, wasn't subglacial floods. It's easy parallels that Harlan. Brett's his story very closely. Well, here's the thing, Sean, his colleagues couldn't really come up with a plausible explanation for how you could form these massive subglacial reservoirs. In fact, what they call the living stone lake event required 84,000 cubic kilometers of water and I 84,000 kilometers. I can do it really quickly here. We would divide that by 30 36 that's about 2,300 cubic miles of water. That's more than all of the Great Lakes combined, vastly bigger than all of the Great Lakes combined. It's probably every lake in North America combined, and he said, this one event required over 2000 cubic miles of water. Well, where did that water come from? So he basically said, well, there must have been a reservoir. Somehow that formed his critics have said, that's impossible. You couldn't form that much water under the ice sheet. Well, what's happened now is the idea of a major cosmic impact into the ice sheet has completely obviated the need for a subglacial reservoir. Because now we have a way of instantaneously

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       melting enormous volumes of,

Speaker 2:          01:05:21       it's no longer a mystery where the water came from. It's fully explained, and this has been the missing piece of the puzzle until the [inaudible] research group began to identify this evidence

Speaker 1:          01:05:30       baffling to me that this is a source of controversy because we know that the great lakes were created by melting glaciers. We also know that there's vast areas of North America that are flattened by these glaciers. You know, a buddy of mine, my friend Doug, lives in Cazenovia, Wisconsin, which is what's called the driftless area, where the, the glaciers didn't go through. I just was there, uh, in May. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's gorgeous gifts, rolling hills, and it's just, it wasn't, it wasn't crushed flat like other parts of North America war. Right? So we know, we know that those glaciers melted and they created the Great Lakes. I mean, the Great Lakes were from glaciers. We know that that's an established fact. So why has all this confusing? I just don't understand why they wouldn't just add that to it. They just couldn't accept the great, the glaciers. Somehow or another in the last 10,000 years, the glaciers just decided to stop smashing North America flat and melt and create these great inland oceans of French water. Yeah, yeah. Bizarre.

Speaker 2:          01:06:26       It's, it's very bizarre. Ultimately a lot, a lot of ideology is, is involved in this. There's, there's um, there's this design. I also have been cut in the modern world as a design not to panic. The public, not to say things that are, that are going to cause that are going to cause panic. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:06:42       Donald Trump being president. I think people are ready now. I think people are ready for panic. I think so. Is there, is anybody debated you on this, either one of you on this?

Speaker 2:          01:06:51       Well, you know, I tried to them but not specifically on this. I tried to do a debate with Zahi Hawass who was the guy who runs the Giza pyramids. And then total total, I mean, very crazy event. There's a video of it online. Quite a a video of it online. Did they last what, 30 seconds? It's something like something like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then, and then later on when he, when he finally agreed to come back into the room, cause he was so angry with me, walked out, when he finally came back into the room, he was asked a question about it. Go back to the tippy and just like you're skeptic, he didn't know anything about go back to the technique or he claimed not to know about it. I mean this is the, this is supposed to be the world's most famous archaea Egyptologist and he knew nothing about this incredible sight in a, in a neighboring country.

Speaker 2:          01:07:33       But one point to make the Randall was talking about the second event 11,600 years ago. We're dealing with an with, with an episode of Cataclysm, which begins 12,800 years ago, an ends 11,600 years ago, both episodes accompanied by massive floods and the 11,600 years ago data, I may have mentioned this last year, it's in, it's in magicians of the gods. What's interesting about that is that is the exact date that plato gives us for the destruction of the lost civilization of Atlantis. Plato. That's the only source we have for Atlantis. It comes to us. Many people think it's all over the place, but it's not. Atlantis comes to us from the Greek philosopher Plato, who lived around 340 BC and he got the story from through his family line from his ancestors so long who had visited Egypt in 600 BC and they're sold on, was told of a great civilization that had existed on earth.

Speaker 2:          01:08:26       That was the progenitor civilization of Egypt. But that was destroyed in a terrible cataclysm. And he asked at a cataclysm involving a gigantic flood and Atlantis was submerged beneath the waves and was never seen again. And so solid said to the priest, when did this happen? And they said three to 9,000 years ago, that was in 600 BC. So that's 9,600 BC, that's 11,600 years ago. That's meltwater pulse. One B. How could they know? You know, how could we have to start taking this stuff more seriously instead of sneering attitude and skepta sizing it out of existence? We need to leave a little bit of room for extraordinary ideas possibly being right. That's the main beef I have with the skeptics is that they want to throw the baby out with the bath water. Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:09:09       I want to add something to that. In, in the tomatoes, you know, Plato Discusses Atlantis in two dialogues and into tomatoes. He prefaces the story of Atlantis by recounting the myth of fate. Now the myth of Fayton is a very interesting story. And basically what it is, is Fayton was the offspring of Haley owes the sun. God who was raised didn't know who his father was. His mother kept it a secret from him. And then one day he was being taunted at school because all of his school mates had, you know, recounting the great deeds of their fathers and everything. So he went home distraught and finally his mother said, well actually your father is the, the big granddaddy of them all. Haley owes the Sun God. So Fayton decides he's going to go and find his father and eventually does and he goes to some celestial realm or his father is located.

Speaker 3:          01:10:01       And the way it is with the, with the, with the, the Greek gods they have on limited powers except they also have certain restrictions. For example, if a god makes a promise, he, he or she cannot go back on it, right? So when Haley, Oh sees fate and his, his lost son come, he's sober joy, he says, I'm so happy to see you. I will grant you any boone you want and fate and says, I want to drive the chariot to the sun. I want to drive your chariot. And Haley, oh says, well I meant anything you wanted to accept that, you know, so it goes back and forth and back and forth. Finally Phaeton convinces his father, let him let me do it. His father says, look, you've got to hang onto those reins tight cause those steeds are going to pull away from you.

Speaker 3:          01:10:48       He gets in there at the gates of the sun open. It describes in the myth you can go, you know, you can read edith with Hamilton or bulfinch or any of the, the, the great retellings of the Greek myths and they'll describe it in there. It goes through the signs of the Zodiac and then all of a sudden it careens off and heads down to earth. And then it describes his whole litany of catastrophes. This setting the earth on fire. And finally the, uh, Jupiter, uh, at, at the, uh, at the beseeching of Poseidon and who's afraid that the oceans are going to boil away, gets Zeus to mount his, his, uh, Mount Olympus and hurl his thunderbolt, which knocks Fayton from the sky and he falls to Earth in, in, in falls into the river Eridanus which is a metaphor for the a Milky Way and his sisters the hell yachty's then a weep over the death of their brother and their tears fall to earth and caused the great flood plato.

Speaker 3:          01:11:43       Then after re referencing that myth, he then says, now this has the form of a myth, but what it really represents is a declaration or a declining of the bodies in space orbiting around the earth and an eventual falling to earth of one of those bodies and a conflagration of all things triggered by the fall of that body. It's intriguing that he mentioned the Zodiac because you know, cause the Taurid meteor stream is so cold because it appears to come at us from the direction of the constellation of Tourist Zodiacal constellation. That's where those shooting stars amongst which has some very large objects that, that have hit us in the past and can hit us again in the future. That's where they come from. They come from that area of the sky. It's an actual human illusion. It appears that they're, they're not actually coming from tourists.

Speaker 3:          01:12:29       It looks like that they come from that area of the sky. They come from that area of the sky. And so anybody in in ancient times who was witnessing and according to the Victor Club and William Napier and those guys who are the British new catastrophists that had been doing all of this work for decades on the Taurid meteor shower have concluded that, you know, in times past it was an extremely active shower and would have created some pretty darn impressive light shows, uh, even if it wasn't causing catastrophes down here below. But what they've, what they've conjectured is that there might be times of multiple tongue goose go like impact bombardment when um, you know, there could be, cause there could be thousands of objects within the tarred meteor stream on the same scale as the tin goose got object. And that if, if you go and you read the accounts, the eyewitness accounts over and over again, people are saying things like, well it looked like it was being disgorged from the sun.

Speaker 3:          01:13:26       It looked like it was being born out of the sun. Right. It looked like a second son in the sky. Like for a short period of time, the son had a twin, right? Well, the summertime cards are coming from their para helion passage around the sun. So you like green was saying they make an elliptical orbit out to Jupiter and back around the sun in this stream, right. Earth crosses that stream twice each year. One time, late June, early July, we crossed. But at that point they're coming from the direction of the sun. So they're, their arrival to earth is going to be very difficult to see because they're coming from the direction of the sun. Right. But that's exactly where on June 30th the Taurid meteor would be coming from. Um, and then also the fact that it's the perfect date for the peak of the, of the shower and the, the correct place in the sky to me is pretty convincing evidence that it was most likely a remnant of that towards stream.

Speaker 3:          01:14:22       The other time that the earth crosses his late October, early November, in fact, we've just passed out of it, um, within the last week basically. But it peaks interestingly, coincidentally, between like October 30th and November 4th or fifth, so it's peaking right around Halloween time. In fact, they've been called the Halloween meteors and there's some very, sometimes they call them the Halloween fireworks. Yeah. But there's some very interesting work done by a, um, a researcher background, early 20th century named Grant Halliburton, who spent about 15 years researching the connections between ancient calendars. And he concluded, one thing very interesting was that lot of these ancient calendars where being synchronized by people's observations of the rise and fall of the pleiades, which is the shoulder of the bowl, the pleiades comprises, uh, basically part of that, uh, constellations all tourists. Yeah. The shoulder of the bull. And what he came up with was that in his research, he discovered that many of these stories that were associated with this, like the slaying of the celestial bull, you know, Gilgamesh and thank do into, and the earliest known a story, they, they fight the celestial bowl.

Speaker 3:          01:15:38       There's many counterparts and variants of that in, in, in mythical stories. Um, and so what he then found out though was that in many cases, the, that, that our modern halloween actually goes back thousands of years to an ancient day of the dead that was observed all over the earth at the same time every year, even in the southern hemisphere. And it usually revolves, revolved around a commemoration of the, the culmination of the pleiades, which is when the pleiades crosses the local meridian. Another words, it, it reaches the key stone of the Royal Arch, so to speak, up in the sky. So if you got an eye on Halloween now and you face the south in the northern hemisphere, you will see the pleiades right at midnight, at midnight, they will be, if you think of the, the, the arch of the Zodiac as being, uh, a, uh, a, um, like a clock.

Speaker 3:          01:16:31       It's right there at midnight, at midnight. Right? Well, here's the interesting link is that in all of these myths, what Halliburton discovered over and over again was that the day of the dead ultimately went back to myths about, of the destruction of the world by a great flood and, or fire. It's fascinating that it's all coming out of the Constellation tourists too, and it's the celestial bowl that they're fighting in these ancient myths and all these cultures around the world are celebrating the day of the dead have this exact same time. This is amazing stuff and right now our science is closing its eyes to this. I think it's fair to say with the Taurid meteor stream,

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       which is a very big issue in this whole discussion that we are dealing with the hidden hand in human history. It's something that is going to ultimately require us to reexplain almost everything, but the skeptics hate it. They can't bear it because first of all it involves cataclysms and secondly it involves the possibility of losing a whole civilization from the record. It's really, it's really interesting when you look at the dates of the this cluster, this episode of bombardment between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago. That's the period that just immediately precedes what mainstream academia think of as the very beginnings of civilization and they've just never the, maybe it's not even their fault, it's this is so recent. This science is so new that they've not had time to adapt to it, but if they adapt to it and take this into account, then suddenly what was an extraordinary and absurd and impossible idea that there was a lost civilization 12,000 years ago becomes a very plausible and reasonable idea and then we start once we can.

Speaker 4:          01:18:13       Once we take that on board, then we can start opening our eyes to archeological anomalies like the Great Sphinx, like Baalbek likes submerged ruins like go Beckley tappy and begin to consider what does all this mean? Are we in fact a species with Amnesia? Are we here forgetful of the truth about ourselves? Maybe that's why we're so fucked up, you know, because we just actually don't know. We've made up a story about where we came from and what we are. I certainly think it plays a part. I also think that conservative skepticism is probably prudent when you're dealing with most scientific, most things that come up that people are claiming. I mean there's so many charlatans out there and crazy people that are claiming new discoveries, but in some cases they examine these discoveries. Is as long as they're far enough away from us or weird enough like this new planet that they believe their, they have a 90 plan sign.

Speaker 4:          01:19:05       Yeah, yeah. They're pretty sure there's something out there. I'd passed the Kuyper belt and they think it's massive. They think it's at least four times, maybe larger than the United States or then, excuse me, the world and the world and got to know a bit of about 10,000 years and that's interesting with comments because this huge, massive object circulating in the outer solar system through the Kuiper belt, which is a source of many of the comments that hit the earth is destabilizing comments from safe orbits and putting them into really dangerous or bits that come our way that correctly if I'm wrong, but like what? What is the source of all these near Earth objects? Is this have anything to do with Earth One and earth to, does it have anything to do with the initial impact that created the moon? Is that because we were hit by another planet, right during the formation of the earth, and this is all scientifically established.

Speaker 4:          01:19:54       Astro scientists or astrophysicist rather, and a astronomers all agree on that, right? There's a lot of debris. The would would go back to that to that time, but comments are another story because they're coming in from the far reaches of outer space. They are coming, they're coming in from the oort cloud and the coin just vast distances away there. Their voyagers, they're kind of messages from the distant reaches of the cosmos, who come in in an unpredictable way because they're all bits are destabilized by something like planet nine. Isn't there something called bodes law where you, uh, you can measure the mass and the orbit of a certain planet and you can accurately depict where the next planet is going to be and doesn't that fall apart somewhere between Mars and Jupiter, this asteroid belt? Yeah. Which, which would indicate that something was probably there.

Speaker 4:          01:20:39       That's why the theory of the asteroid belt, that it wasn't exploded planet. Of course, there's a lot of opposition to that theory too. You know, you're right. Skepticism really has an important role to play. It's, it's very, it's really, it's really essential that we are skeptical and otherwise we'd all be found Zacharias itching and waiting for the Annunaki to land. Exactly what the solar houses. December 21st, 2012 we'd all be going, what the fuck? Now I'm homeless four years later and I have to say there's a skeptic called Michael Heizer who has done really an excellent job of, of thoroughly, you know, debunking the bogus translations of Zachariah stitching. Is, is such an as wrong.com is that section is wrong.com. It's a very useful, it's a very useful site. So we hated him and loved him at the same time. So, so sad. I love the idea of the aliens come down and manipulating the monkeys and making us to mine gold.

Speaker 4:          01:21:28       It's a wonderful story, but unfortunately it's a work of science fiction. There's not a work of fact. Zachariah we need, I knew him. He was a fascinating man. I once drove him from stonehenge to London. We had, we had many conversations. He was a deep and serious researcher, but I think he, I think he got, he got carried away with his own fat. I also think that that fantasy became very lucrative and it also became a source of identity to him. And I followed him pretty closely as well. I've read the 12th Planet and, uh, I got really into his research and this is in my early pot smoking days when I first started smoking pot. So I was, I was all in, I was all in. And then as I got wiser and then as I got mine on this maybe not wiser, I started recognizing objectively why these, these things are so attractive.

Speaker 4:          01:22:16       The fantastical is more attractive than the practical. And so something else, again, I don't want to, I don't want to put in down and I'm, I'm here also to say that and did a lot of really good work. He was at, he's a clever guy and he did a lot of very, very, very thorough research. Um, I've just lost my track actually smoking too much. Dope. Where was I going? Ah, well we were talking about, um, the, all the, the difference between the fantastical and the practical, that there's this inclination to accept things that are fun. Yeah. You know, that's where I was going to say is that when you start talking about the Annunaki, those from heaven to earth came these fantastic creatures from, thank you. You've brought my memory in the Arrow thing. I remembered what I was going to say. What's interesting in part because I know it kind of wants could be good. What was, um, what's, what's interesting is that the level of technology that's attributes

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       to the Anu Nakia bleak Nephilim, that that level of technology is the level of technology that we had in the 1970s when we were, um, you know, Nasa was doing its stuff. So it's NASA technology from the 1970s that is projected out onto, that is projected over the ground, but it's projected out that is projected out onto his theory of the past. Now, it seems to me very unlikely that the Nefa limb or the Anunnaki would have had for 400,000 years, which is what he's saying, the same technology that NASA had in the 1970s as much more likely that he's projecting that onto the data rather than that it's actually inherent in the dark.

Speaker 6:          01:23:44       There was also some interesting ideas that he had that turned out to be ideas that scientists had also proposed about preserving our atmosphere by, by levitating or by suspending reflective particles in our atmosphere. And that that is something that the Annunaki in his books we're going to use gold for because gold has such unique properties, which is why they use gold to plate things. Cause you can take a little tiny piece of gold. You could play this entire table goals. Really spectacular piece of, uh, I mean it's just, there's nothing like it, right?

Speaker 2:          01:24:18       Absolutely. There's a lot of really good material in such in, but unfortunately the translations of the texts, the translations of the techs are not translations of the text. They misrepresent the text off. And what he did was he took a 19th century translation and he massaged it so that it would fit his fit, his argument. And that's a pity. So we need skeptics and they help us to sift out the wheat from the chaff and that. But, but at occasionally what the skeptics do with this drive to, to criticize anything that's not mainstream. Occasionally what they do is they let go a really good idea which deserves investigation in which the human species could benefit from. And that's my feeling is where this amazing species, we've developed all this science. Why are we, why are we so ready to let go of wonderful ideas?

Speaker 6:          01:25:05       Well, it's also fascinating to me that because of what situation has been sort of criticized for people now ignore the stuff that's absolutely undeniable. Like the actual stone tablets themselves, the clay tablets, or you can see the depictions of the solar system somehow or another, these people from 6,000 plus years ago had a detailed map of the solar system. Clear idea of the soldiers was the size in like a, a relatively correct order. And the planets in the right place. Like they somehow or another knew that Jupiter was bigger than Mars. They knew these things in some weird way and we don't know why. And we don't know how. Also the caduceus representing the, the, the, the double helix of the DNA. That's a really fascinating concept too, that the caduceus is used for medicine and it's used to rep mean it's just, he had some really interesting points saccharide did. So it's Kinda, it's Kinda too bad. There was so much crazy involved in that. I think

Speaker 4:          01:26:02       any of us should, when we're exploring the deep and hidden mysteries of the past is, is to go to a lot of different sources. Go to a lot of dots, just stick with the mainstream. Don't just stick with the alternative, but try to tie it to bring it all together. And in a way, that's what I tried to do in my books except the skeptics still hate them. But this is so hard because it's so, it's so fun to go with the crazy story. Yeah. Like the, the alien story is so compelling. It's so fun. Very compelling story. I mean, if we found some sort of evidence of aliens, it would be so utterly spectacular. Even if it was a simple alien. Like I've always said this, that if we found a a jellyfish on the moon, we would freak out. But you know, there's really complex, bizarre things at the bottom of our ocean and we've never discovered just they're just not in the correct location for us to be excited.

Speaker 4:          01:26:50       And then the other, the other issue, we're getting slightly off our flood topic here, but the other issue of, uh, of, of entities that, that the encounters with entities, anybody who smoked dmt will know that as I have, as, as you have, that will know that you do encounter entities in the DMT, in the DMT state and they do communicate with us. And there's a lot of parallels with the ets or the aliens as they are described in modern ufo abduction accounts. And Rick Strassman, have you ever had them on your show? You know, rick got sick. He was supposed to be here a couple of times. We're trying to reschedule it now, but he had some pretty serious health issues now. We had a date scheduled out, but I love that guy. I got a chance to sit down with them a couple of times and talked to them and I have of course you presented dmt.

Speaker 4:          01:27:34       That's cool. Yeah, he's brilliant and he's so important to me because I remember when I did it, I was so confused. I mean to me it was like the first, my first dmt experience changed everything I thought about the world and I immediately didn't give a shit about aliens anymore. Right. Like it was almost instantaneous. Like before then I was like Roswell, they've got the got the ship pan. Yeah, it's in a hangar. But what I encountered doing dmt was so spectacularly alien that the pedestrian concept of something that looks like a person but has a bigger head in large eyes and high tech. Yeah, it's weird and cools. It would be, if it was real, it was nothing. I mean, literally not 1000000th as interesting as what you absolutely can encounter when you do dmt. That's the aliens. That's the aliens. And utterly alien realm filled with alien intelligences who commute.

Speaker 4:          01:28:24       And of course again the skeptics say, oh, it's all just made up in your brain, but we don't know. That is open to the possibility that we are dealing with areas of reality that are not normally accessible to our senses. And that become accessible to our senses by retuning the receiver wavelength of the brain, which is what he suggests DMT does. And I think, I think that's very plausible. And at the very least, those who are interested in Ufos and aliens should be also investigating this line of inquiry. Can we, can we use changes in consciousness to understand the majestic complexity of the universe in which we live? And I think the answer is definitely yes. And many of Rick's volunteers, I paraphrase, but they came with reports that

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       the entities who had encountered them said, we're so glad you've discovered this technology. Now we can communicate with you much more easily. You know, it's fascinating. So there's a technology for encountering other intelligences and against that, this mechanistic simplistic alien meme that's going around now that they're a bit like us, but they came here in higher tech, higher tech. It's dull by comparison with his dog by comparison, if you're interested in anybody's, the book is amazing. It's called DMT, the spirit molecule. And he has a new book that he's putting out about dmt and the spirit and the soul of prophecy. And um, he's just a really, really interesting guy. But his, his experience that he did experiments that he did were the first, I think in many, many decades to get approved by the government. Correct. So he did everything above ground. I mean, he was above board.

Speaker 4:          01:29:52       He was a kid. And because it, because it was government approved the, his, his remit was that he had to find some therapeutic benefit for dmt and he couldn't actually, but that's not the point. I'm sure actually there are therapeutic benefits, but that's not the point. The point is here is a tool for investigating the mystery of consciousness and the mysterious nature of reality. I mean, fuck me if we get five or six volunteers who haven't compared notes all coming back who've met entities who said, we're so happy you found this technology. It's hard to explain that as just to reduce it to brain activity. Not only that, when we talk about things that are so big in are ignored by mainstream culture, this is one that's just like that. You're talking about an indogenous human chemical. Yeah. That not only is in us but is in thousands of different plants.

Speaker 4:          01:30:39       Like I mean, how many different plants contain DMT? Huge number. Very prosaic ones like peas and you know, there's the main store acacia. That's what I was going to say. The tree is actually illegal. This isn't that. But the Jerusalem, uh, the professors from the University of Jerusalem, I believe that any Shannon, yeah, they were talking about, they believe that that's what the story of the burning Bush and Moses's. So that is, um, Mimosa with the DMT and Syrian root with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor. In other words, it's, it's Iowasca, but a, a Middle Eastern alternative of it doing the same thing like molecularly. And isn't it possible in some way that the idea of the burning Bush was them figuring out how to dry or extract DMT and burn it? Very likely, possibly. Right? Because they're talking about the burning Bush producing God, and it just so happens that this bushes, the Acacia tree is incredibly common and super rich and DMT and it's all over the area. And I should probably insert at this point that if you're at all familiar with the masonic ritual, you'll know that the acacia plant plays a central role. That's why you're one of them. 1% Mason characters. Everyone now, every now allows insider. Every now and then on facebook Randall, I get accused of being a free mason. Hancock is a freemason. That's not as exciting as that. It explains everything. I know lots of free masons. I spoken in Masonic Lodges, but I'm an author and they belong to clubs.

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       You know, I went to a fee, I went to a wedding that my friend Duncan trussell was performing at and for these two satanists and like 2003 and to this day it was, what's the one of the lovies? Anton Levay or Stanton Levay, whatever is his son. And his son got married. It was some young hedonist, you know, and they call themselves satanists and a, so dunkin performed at this a wedding and I went there. To this day, I get fucking tweets about being a satanist. So I can't join your little club pal. I can't go into your masons. I need to confess here. Yes. You didn't realize this, but I secretly initiated you. Oh my God. Oh, you're in. So you get in. How do you still feel the initiated somebody? Can you do that for real? No, I'm scared. I sort of did sort of, so you could get him in if you want it to though, right?

Speaker 1:          01:32:48       If you know the people, of course you even you joe. I don't think so. It's on helping, bro. I, I met a couple of masons. They're very cool. Well, most masons don't really understand the corpus of symbolism. That's that they're sitting on top of, I got to say that not to get off on the free masons, but same thing. There's a mass of symbolism and that's the whole, that's, that's the thing that they are custodians of and most of them don't have a clue what it means. But near doing an important job by preserving this corpus of symbolism through the, through the layout of the lodge, the, um, the meaning of every component in the lodge because it's a purely astronomical allegory. And then you have the masonic carpets and that's where you have the whole story of the comet, the flood. It's all there.

Speaker 1:          01:33:34       The acacia plant, it's all there. It's all, correct me if I'm wrong, but it's, it's all, uh, also an integral part of how Washington DC was designed. Is that true? Yeah, to some extent. I haven't, you know, I honestly haven't studied that. What I've seen is that there's a, there's a bunch of videos we could watch it where they started. Describe how the layout, you know, is in some way some sort of sacred geometry. I think what it's based on. Free masons were massively involved in the construction of Washington as they were as many great cities and city I lived in England has got, you know the major masonic architecture. So is it like people like me, like my initial prejudice, I hear something like the Mason was like up fucking dudes in a cult. Get outta here, leave me alone. Like we, we assume that all groups of people that follow anything somehow or another a wacky Mason's in my opinion, they're largely a drinking club for men.

Speaker 1:          01:34:23       Mainly that's what it is women in at all. But they, you can make special arrangements to bring women into my life. When I've given a talk in a lodge, I've given talks in two or three lodges been asked to do so then they make a special ceremony to allow my wife Santha to coming cause I won't go anywhere without Santa's. So women can, women can go in, but then there are more, there are others within masonry who are pursuing deeply esoteric interest and exploring the mysteries and you can have incredible conversations and facet and it's just another, another group of people who you know are doing, uh, doing their thing. It's not for me. I wouldn't join,

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       I don't, I would lose. I think if I joined free masonry it would, we can meet as an author I think. I think I'm better able to comment on these things by not being a member of any such. Great. That's interesting. Why do you think that? Well, because I think I have to remain open to all possibilities and if I, if I, if I commit myself to a particular line, I don't commit myself to a particular religion. I don't protect, commit myself to a particular men's club either. I just, which is what masonry is. I think if I commit that then, but then ultimately I would become a spokesperson for that and I don't want to be that. That makes a lot of sense. Considering your occupation and how important being open minded has been to your life. It's vital. It's absolutely, absolutely without it.

Speaker 4:          01:35:36       How could you have ever done fingerprints of the gods? I could not. I mean the, the, the thing, the initial thing where, uh, you were telling me about Ethiopia, that place where they believe that the, the arc of the covenant lays, which is one of the most bizarre ideas ever, and that was my first book on a historical mystery was the sign and the ceiling. You go into it, it's so interesting, but I just, I've always imagined you as a young guy forced to sort of reconcile with this bizarre piece of evidence. You've got these old men that have cataracts in her eyes, like they were on radiation sites and no one's allowed to go inside and see this thing and they claim they have the Ark of the covenant in there and like what the fuck is, it was the beginning of the magic.

Speaker 4:          01:36:21       It was the beginning of a magical journey for me. It's been a magical journey for all your fans too. For guys like me, man, when I read fingerprints of the gods, it was to me, it was a one of those books I just couldn't put down and it was so mind blowing and this is again was in the heart of my fucking thank you. Prince was published in 1995 and magicians came out in 20 in 2015 and I would say in that time the, the evidence when I made the case for a lost civilization and a global cataclysm in fingerprints of the gods, I can't begin to account for the amount of hostility and anger and rage that I generated in the academic community. The idea was considered to be absolutely absurd 20 years later with magicians of the gods. It's not so absurd anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:37:03       The evidence is mounting. We have incredible evidence now for a global cataclysm in exactly the period that counts between twelve thousand eight hundred eleven thousand six hundred years ago and we have sites, Laker Beckley, Tempe. We have a redefinition of the Sphinx. The whole area is just about to explode in, in, in, in the future. We're on the edge. I believe of a of a paradigm shift in this comic material is central to it. What I really appreciate about your courage is that you've also had the courage to admit when you've made mistakes. You're, you're not, you don't in any way pretend to be some sort of a bear of secret knowledge that no one else possesses. Absolutely not a guru. I don't want to be anything like that. I'm a reporter. That's, that's what I am and I'm, I'm a reporter who's reporting on offbeat subjects and to some extent I'm an I'm an outsider. It's one of the talks I do now. It's about being an being an outsider. I think there is a, I think there is a place for outsiders in society. I don't think you're an outsider.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       I think you're an outsider from the established mainstream ideas. I just think that I do love the same. We're both, we're both outside is in that area. I'm working in different fields to get into this, but don't you think that these established channels that were so deeply grooved in distributing information, those things have widened so wide now where you're getting [inaudible] a professor could do a podcast, like he could teach a class and go write a book or he can do a podcast on a certain subject and like you're aware of Dan Carlin and that hardcore history podcast I just can't stop raving about. But what he's done is brought historical, accurate, but really dramatic stories of real events that took place to millions. Like, you know, that's just that no one's doing that like this is, but it's not mainstream. Well, what's more mainstream than being number one on the itunes podcast list, which he has all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:38:51       What is more mainstream and he must be getting millions of downloads. It's part of the big changes taking place in our society that the old structures are being overthrown. That being thrown away. It's a very uncomfortable time. It's a very uncertain time is a very exciting time, right? Because we can build out of this something something amazing in the future. The Internet is had a huge part to play in it. The fact that people can communicate with one another all around the world. Since I've had a web presence in the last, I was late comer, but maybe two or two to three years ago I've been getting contacted by, I mean professionals from around the world. I've got probably a dozen major ones. I've geologists who want to know more about an interest in what you said earlier about debating. You know, I'm always looking for somebody to debate about I, you know, because I have questions and I'm thinking maybe somebody, even somebody who would disagree with me on something good still helped me answer some of the questions.

Speaker 3:          01:39:42       Right. But I tried to associate as much as possible and hang out with professionals in the field. And of course what I discover is that a lot of them are working in these things, park time, almost clandestinely without making it part of their, you know, if I go on a field trip of geologists into the, the flood lands, none of them are really working on it full time. It's all part time. You know, they're working for the government or working for the oil companies are, you know, x exploration, mineral exploration, whatever. They're doing this research into geological catastrophes. [inaudible] on their own time. Right. But recently, just last summer, I got invited to actually present some of my research to the Atlanta Geological Society, which is the largest society of professional geologists in the southeast. So I jumped at the chance rather than, you know, and so I presented hoping that I would get challenged, that somebody would say, wait a second, there's a flaw in your thinking.

Speaker 3:          01:40:40       Your didn't happen. So did you make friends with some of these, uh, mainstream geologists? Yeah, well, I mean, I've been knowing, I mean, when I, I just took a trip for, um, uh, in September, spent 10, 10 days back out in the flood lions. Yeah. I had a geologist with me on that trip. Um, so yeah, I'm getting to know more and more people who are working as well. You know, I, I majored in geology in college, so I still am in touch regularly with the head of the geology department. I see her pretty much on a regular basis and had been keeping her apprised of some of my stuff and she has off offered to sponsor me at whatever point. I think that I can pull it together as a dissertation, but we'll see how that goes. I mean, my objective was to learn geology, not to become a professional geologist. I wasn't interested in working for the government or working for the energy industry. I had geological questions and that's why I majored in geology.

Speaker 6:          01:41:35       And you've walked the walk. And in my opinion, you know more about this stuff than 10 fully phd geologists. So you always freaked me out. So what's, what's fascinating to me, uh, about all this is that I think what you've done has been very measured. You know, everything you back up with facts and photographs and descriptions and disclaimers. You know when you, when you say, well it's, it is possible. You will go down other various paths. You're not dogmatic about these ideas but you've spent so much time going over this. I don't know if there's another, if there's a commensurate guy in mainstream archeology that has been public about it the way you have been because if there is, I feel like we probably would have heard about them. Your podcasts have been the ones that we've done. They'd been seen by millions of people they didn't listen to.

Speaker 6:          01:42:25       By millions of people. I mean the, the information is getting out there and making a real difference. You're always going to have the, the guys like I think Michael Shermer is very important and not criticizing him and put that knee jerk reaction to do something to mock something or put down something that's not mainstream. Like one of his tweets, he said, you know what archeology with evidence is, and he wrote archeology. Like why would you even tweet that? This doesn't even make any sense like that. That's someone who's not paying attention to your work that makes it all you do is focus on Evan. I'm reminded of the Shakespearian line. We thinks the lady doth protest too much. Why does he need to say that? It's got the evidence. You know, always tweets like Fox News saying fair and balanced. You know he's tweeting at you with this.

Speaker 6:          01:43:05       Meanwhile, your entire book is based on photographic evidence and all the other various pieces of evidence. I mean that you're examining all these pieces of evidence. It's not, these aren't things that you've invented. No, these are actual real sites that you can look at. I'm drawing inferences from them that they don't like. That's the thing. Well, what Robert Schoch and guys like him are so important. Guys who have the courage that WHO's a Boston university professor has the courage to look at the stones and say, this is the product of water erosion. The stones. Kudos to rubbish Shellac as a geologist, as a, as a a career academic geologist who's taken that risk and put himself out there and follow the evidence where it leads. Another one is Danny hilman not to with judge in Indonesia

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       who's been responsible for the investigation of this extraordinary site at Gunung Padang. Uh, where work has been stopped since 2014 again, he's a highly credential geologist is Indonesia's leading expert in mega thrust earthquakes, but he's been looking at archeology, bringing his geological expertise to that. So the things are changing. We are finding, we are finding academics who are willing to engage and willing to to discuss. I, I got into a very interesting email correspondence with a guy called Daniel Lowman at Baalbek but from the German archeological institute who's an architect and an archeologist and he was very civil with me and he answered my questions. We went into it in depth. We had quite a long debate. That's very refreshing. That kind of thing wasn't happening 20 years ago. Yeah, that is very refreshing. Now what about those pyramids in Bosnia? Has that been? What is, what is the deal with that?

Speaker 2:          01:44:43       I, those things I've been there, I know some were magic personally. Same as the guy who's, who's promoted the site. Um, I liked sam very much. Um, I must say when I'm in his aura, I'm extremely convinced. Uh, but when I, when I look rationally at the, at the so-called Pyramids, I don't think there are pyramids. I think they're hills. I did spend with Sam showing me around, I did spend three days in Bosnia looking at the so called Pyramid of the Sun, the Pyramid of the moon. They love pyramid and so on and so forth. I do see that, uh, a tourist industry has built up around this and it's a fabulously beautiful, intriguing site. Massive, beautiful mountainous place. But they are hills. They are not pyramids. Impression is, given that there are tunnels, passageways inside the pyramids, that's not true. The passageways are about two, two and a half kilometers away.

Speaker 2:          01:45:32       They're very low tech. Um, I, I just don't, I just don't see it. And for that reason, I did not cover the Bosnian pyramids and magicians of the Gods. I'm not going to say they're not pyramids. I'm not going to write a book saying that they're wrong, but I they didn't excite me enough to justify devoting a chapter to them. There's much more exciting and important archeological discoveries that are being made, like go back to the Tempe, which need more space and there's some, there's some pyramid like structures or hills and China as well, right as the thousands of pyramids in China cm, the province of crm, and it's just the moment you land there for a few aircraft. You're seeing pyramids everywhere. I've been feeling that there are certainly hundreds and hundreds of them distributed across fields vanishing off into the distance in all, in all directions.

Speaker 2:          01:46:19       They'd been terrorist and used as agriculture, but local farmers grow, grow crops on them. I went there with Chinese archeologists. They haven't excavated a single one, not one. Why not? They said, we don't have, this was nearly 10 years ago. I was there. They said they probably got the money now, but they said then they didn't have the money. They said, we're an old country. We don't mind if we wait 200 years to get to grips with this is Christ and the famous tomb of the first emperor is part of this pattern. It is also a pyramid.

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       It has also not been excavated. The terracotta army around it has been from the terracotta army is amazing. Oh yeah. It was on display somewhere, wasn't it? Where you can go and see it live. They did some kind of trouble. I want to see that thing. I'd want to look at those things. What put a bizarre concept now these pyramids. So this one that this, uh, this emperor was buried in, that had the terracotta army. Was that a pyramid as well? It is a period. It is, absolutely. It's a manmade pyramid. Uh, the terracotta army was buried around its edges, not in the pyramid itself. So the army was there to protect him, to protect his soul into the afterlife. Seems to be in the, seems to be in the idea. And then there's a mythology that's come down that the, that within the pyramid is a lake of mercury.

Speaker 4:          01:47:33       That there are mechanical devices in there which will fire arrows at you. If you go in there. There's a whole story about how how intensely protected it is. And up to this day, it's not been excavated. That's so crazy. How could someone leave that alone? And you know, even major archeological sites like t when Arco in Bolivia for example, you'll find that only about 2% of the scientists being excavated. I don't know how we can draw inferences about the whole site from a tiny little fragment fraction like that. And that's the, that's the problem I think with archeology and it's why we have to, you know, consider another way. We're looking at an image of the terracotta army now in front of this pyramid and it is spectacular now that I think about it. I don't think that was on display anywhere. I think maybe they had a couple of them.

Speaker 4:          01:48:18       They brought some of them. They came to the British Museum. There were a number of museums, but it's so much bigger than I thought it was. Yeah. I mean there's, I mean, how many, there's thousands. There's thousands of these terracotta figures. Absolutely. And this period was made out of, what is it? Stone rammed earth mainly. Okay. So they just sort of shaped the, the ground they just dug around. They brought in earth and turn it into a pyramid of mouse over the, but it wasn't, it was just massive stone blocks. It's not massive stuff. That's why they can grow crops on the sides of some of these pyramids. How weird. So they would build these giant mounds of dirt and then dig holes in him and support him like they would be doing inside. They created the interior subterranean as they were building the whole thing over it and they just stacked dirt on top of it.

Speaker 4:          01:49:03       Yeah. Wow. What a weird way to make a house. Yeah. And then we have to consider this with, you know, with, with archeological sites all all around the world is that any site may actually not be the product of just one culture, but may have been reworked and worked over and used by many different cultures over this, any different periods. Stunning to me. Um, I found out about this because of a friend of John Anthony West who was here with him. He showed me, he lives in China and he showed me some video of it and I was like, how do I not know about this? I had no idea. There's this many of them. Also. Here's one that's exposed was this controversial ancient pyramids of China. That one looks blocky. Yeah. Yeah. Well that is a, another thing about China that we just don't have a clue. When we, when

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       we think about the, the age and scale of things, we're so silly. We've only been around since, you know, the 1776 is when the country was established. It's not really that long ago. You're dealing with China. You're dealing with literally thousands of years of civilization all rising and falling and taking place and adapting and growing all in this one area. It's still in our eyes in a lot of ways. It's kind of behind, right? I mean, they're behind environmentally. They're behind when it comes to human rights.

Speaker 2:          01:50:19       Consider this. The Portuguese in the late 14 hundreds have rounded the Cape of Good Hope and they've entered the Indian Ocean in their little ships. They've entered the Indian Ocean and they actually establish a huge empire. They go to Monica, they go all over the place. Okay. The seas are open to them. If they had come 40 years earlier, they would have encountered the Chinese treasure ships ships that were 50 times larger than the little caravels that the Portuguese were sailing in Varsha. And know what the Chinese did at that time. They went through a period where they felt they just wanted to give gifts to people and they put together these huge fleets carrying incredibly precious gifts, silks and, and ceramics. And they took them all around the Indian Ocean and they just gave them to people. So off the coast of east Africa and in East Africa, you can find remains of this pottery from this episode. And then a Chinese emperor came along and he closed the doors and burned all the boats, shut everything down, and didn't let anybody speak to China for 200 years. Wow. What a Dick.

Speaker 1:          01:51:23       Well, he, he felt that it was time for the Chinese culture to turn inward. Yeah. They were afraid that they were, that their ancient culture on one, and there might have been maybe a laudable motive in that they were concerned that the age had culture was going to get contaminated by too much contact with the generative cultures from other places. And that was a factor in it. The constant desire to maintain the current situation. It's human. We have to say it's some kind of, some kind of human nature for sure. I'd love to see some of these images of the, of the crowd and stuff from the chemist that comes prairie at what, what please, unless let's, let's have a look at it. You've got that little carrier that this Chinese parents are still blowing my mind. They blow my mind as well. I just can't believe that they haven't been asked.

Speaker 2:          01:52:09       It's an eerie, spooky scene. I'm at our recommended anybody to go to Seattle and I just, I just, it's incredible how many of them there are. Um, and how unexplained it all is. And this again, it feeds into my general point is we do,

Speaker 1:          01:52:21       I remember our past, what are we looking at here? Let's, can we pause? Sorry. I can talk about what we're looking at. Yeah. You look at this one. That way you can hit the mic right in front of you. Okay. This is the beginning of it. Okay. What were, here's what we're looking at, Mike, right up to there. We're looking at a place in western Montana called Khamish prairie, and you'll see some hills in the foreground and you see a base and in the background, right? Okay. Right here on of this hill and down

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       on the side here, you'll see that there are some coring operations. Those are coring gravel because everything you're looking at your, this whole landscape between the hills are these large masses of gravel, trillions of tons of gravel. Now what we're gonna do is we're going to start sweeping around as the video plays, and you're going to load us down here a series of ripples. Oh, okay. I see that. Okay. And I'm going to have Jamie pause in a second, but let's keep coming around. Do you start seeing the ripples? I am landscape. Let's pause right there. Right there. Let's pause. No, I wish I had a pointer, but if you look up, you're going to see a flat piece of land, like a tone coming out, rounded out. Jamie's uh,

Speaker 7:          01:53:33       right here.

Speaker 5:          01:53:36       That's it. He gets you a laser. That's a delta. That's a delta. You know what a Delta is? You ever heard of the delta? It's when the river comes into a body of water and it's carrying sediment and because the river is moving along swiftly, it's carrying the sediment. But when it comes into the standing body of water, it slows down and it drops its sediment had built a delta. The whole city of Portland, for example, is built on a giant Delta. Right? New Orleans is built on a delta. Right. Okay, so what we're seeing near as at Delta and then in front of it, we're seeing rippled landscape.

Speaker 7:          01:54:12       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:54:12       Let's keep coming around Jamie and soulful landscaped. It looks exactly like the beach looks. Yeah, keep coming around with this. The thing is fractal because this, this is the whole mystery of this, that this happens at a scale of inches on beaches and the scale of hundreds of feet here. Top again. Lord, right here in the middle you see a massive delta spewed out like a big tongue splayed out. And then right down here you start seeing the ripples and there was a farm house. You see the farmhouse there. Now those ripples are the tallest ones are about the height of a five story building. Whoa. How bizarre. Keep, okay, let's keep, keep sweet. Swinging around. Stop it. Stop this for a second. Um, if you don't mind. No, I don't see these things. They're the size of a five story building. What does that like 70 feet or something like that?

Speaker 5:          01:55:00       50 feet. Okay, so that's, those are 50 feet high. And how much water we'll, we'll get to that. Let's see. So let's see the rest of it and these are just dirt right there, there. Well, if you dig into one, what you're going to find is there are, there are a massive, okay, let's pause the game. Look at this. This is crazy. This is totally crazy. This is one of the craziest things you'll ever see. These ripples repeated ripples in an area where there's nothing else like it. This is the fingerprints of the flood. That's what it is. Wow. Where can someone look at this? How does someone look at this in real? You know this right now. This is what we're looking at this as this video. Um, well my colleague

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Brad Young did this with his drone. Um, and I think he's got it on the website. Geo Cosmic rex is being played in the youtube video right now. Okay. All right. So the youtube people are cool with it. If you're listening on Itunes, find it, find it on youtube, but it's worth looking at it. It's what my point, this is, um, this is mind blowing shit. I think you made the crucial point, Joe, which is, which is that we can understand what this is because we can see it on any beach. We can see how water flows receding across a sandy medium will produce ripples. But here they're on this unbelievable scale where they're hundreds of feet long and 50 feet high, where they dwarf houses and they're lying all across. And that to what that tells us is that a huge waterflow went across this plane and did this.

Speaker 1:          01:56:29       You will seeing it from this perspective above, which is a rare perspective, unless you're in a plane or a helicopter or something, you get a chance to look at it this way. You really get a better sense of what it is. If you are on the ground there, you'd probably say, Oh, look at all the hills taught to say quite get the impression are we did visit this, this location. Um, and, and, and to that day it was overcast. So you don't quite get the effect like you do when you've got low sun angle really helps you to see what, what, what's going on in the landscape. Can I ask you, is there a dispute to this? Is there no, no. Nobody disputes it. Nobody knows from a flood. Not Anymore. Wow. No. In fact, it was this j t party, nobody disputes that. It was caused by massive waterflows.

Speaker 1:          01:57:12       Those same people would still not buy into the notion that there was this one humongous flood. Okay. So they think it's an accumulative effect, but that this was all created towards the bottom of Lake Missoula, right? Yeah. And this was supposed to actually represent the draining of lake missoula. Right. Whereas I argue from a number of different reasons that this is the filling missoula. I have a friend of mine who, uh, his friend lives in Montana and they found a dinosaur on his ranch. Allow, yeah. Like really recently. That's a nice thing to find. We should come back to that because there's a connection here. Yeah. The, well, the Great Western inland sea, all that, that area there was, I mean this is a crazy place at one point in time. It's still is, I'll give it a different way. The water here, Joe, that did this, the way to visualize this is to again, begin to think a tsunami.

Speaker 1:          01:58:00       You have to think tsunami because it's a tsunami is the closest scale of water flow that we've experienced in, in modern times. No river flood. His even approached this, right? No, no, no flooding, any flood plain, nothing that we can put into perspective. The closest, the closest we can get to it as this is a tsunami, but even there you got to picture the tsunamis that we've experienced in the last decade and a half and you know in, in Indonesia, in Japan when they made landfall, both tsunamis were roughly between 20 and 50 feet depending on where you were relative to the, to the oncoming wave and how far distance you were from it. Here what you have to visualize is a tsunami

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       sweeping over the land that's over a thousand feet deep. That's, that's what happened here. And we know that because we can trace the, the, the high water marks on the hillsides are clearly left. The high water marks are clearly etched into the, into the hillsides. So we now know based upon the study of the ripples in the water here was moving down, it's filling this base and it's rushing in and a great tsunami from the north of freshwater melt water coming off the ice sheet and it's sweeping down over this land. It probably two or 300 million cubic feet per second, which is an inconceivable amount of water. It's, it's many times in excess of every river flowing on earth flowing today all at once. It's, it's beyond that many times, 10 or 20 times beyond that one of the trip you're things about water is that water in in itself?

Speaker 5:          01:59:36       It's kind of fractal on some sort of a weird way. When you look at the, the, the actual molecules of water, it's almost like we don't do, we don't distinguish it as being a fractal thing cause we see it as like this moving flowing. But if you're looking at the actual molecules of water, a cup of water with that, you dip your fingers in, which is seemingly completely innocuous, becomes this massive element of change. When the volume is a thousand feet high and it's rolling over with massive amounts of weight behind them, it's that same stuff. Massive amounts of weight, enough enough voice that it's actually causing seismic responses in only imagine how much weight are you talking about? Let's get can create these 50 foot high walls. But this what's fascinating to me is that we don't have, we, we don't have a scale like in our minds as a reference, like the difference between that Little Cup and these gigantic waves that, uh, you, you see that a surfer's a travel by jet ski to get to, you know, the off of a, uh, I believe it's Mexico, right?

Speaker 5:          02:00:39       You ever seen those massive ways they go way out, miles out to get to these crazy waves and we ride them in that like 60, 70 feet high. Like that's, that's the comparison. Almost like a glass of water to those waves. And then that to this scales up, it scales up, it scales up and at a certain point it can change. The whole story of civilization almost doesn't compute. You can intellectualize it, but it's almost not computing. One of these flood flows here is three orders of magnitude greater than the largest measured modern flood. In other words, over a thousand times greater in terms of peak discharge or volume, you would have to scale up at least a thousand times greater than any modern measured flood to get to the smallest. Really of these flows here cause this is, this is just one re one place, one locale of an five states where you can trace the, the literally the, the uh, an ocean of fresh water sweeping across the Pacific northwest.

Speaker 3:          02:01:41       Pretty much washing away anything that was there.

Speaker 4:          02:01:43       It's almost like we have a defense mechanism built in where we ignore how vulnerable we really are. Like we put it maybe that's one of the reasons why people are so reluctant to really go deep into studying asteroidal impacts. I think it was, or even to pay attention to this, stuff like that. This could happen and this is, I mean it does enough to separate subjects because this is the result of the comment impact on the, on the ice cap. This is, this is the, this is why I feel that the research in this field is so vital.

Speaker 3:          02:02:12       Okay. Right there. Yeah. Now here, notice this is Craig. That's a beach. It's a beach. It's a beach for giant monsters is what it is. You can see in this here that you've actually got three massive currents converging here. Do you see that over here on the right, you've got a massive current coming in that would be uh, from the west and then we're standing. We would be standing looking down current of course this, the, um, the drone I'm guessing here is about 200 feet in elevation. So the top of the water was another eight to 900 feet above this perspective right here and it's moving very, very fast and it's sweeping down into a river valley that's down in those mountains you see in the distance. And from there it's being carried down in joining up other equally as large floods coming in from other valleys. And all of this is happening at once and it's covering five states basically. And that's just one region that's being affected by this sudden catastrophic melting of the ice sheet.

Speaker 4:          02:03:19       They are dealing with the largest flood that ever occurred on earth. It's the simplest, yeah, this is insane. I mean, it's insane. Look at just how large here in North America and it happened 12,800 years ago and it's story has yet to be fully told isn't impossible. There was something larger before, like a the 65 million year ago, one that hit the Yucatan. Like what? You know, what kind of an impact did that have? Well it actually, cause if, if different kind of happened 12,000 years ago, we wouldn't be having, none of us would. Yeah, that'd be a wrap, right? Yeah. That was a single lodge objective about six miles wide. That was, that was a much more devastating impact then the impact of 12,800 years ago, but nevertheless, those impacts of 12,800 years ago were really, really bad and they did stuff like this and anything that was in the way of this, of these massive flows of water would have been rubbed completely from the story. He makes sense.

Speaker 3:          02:04:14       Here's the thing that the Michael Shermer is don't get, when you understand the extent of this, the scale of this phenomena in the severity, the inconceivable severity of this in the aftermath of an event like this, what would remain of a, of a city of Villi

Speaker 4:          02:04:32       refrigerator? No, not a goddamn thing. Nothing. Nothing would exist in the aftermath of this and most things wouldn't exist. I mean, you find like an old refrigerator or a car up on blocks and someone's backyard and the south and it seemed good. 1970s in the the, the rot has gotten into a frame. The H is going to eat it. Nature's eating it up just in a couple of decades. Right. What's it going to be like in a couple of thousand years? It should not be surprised about how little we really know about our pos. This is also a comfort game, but our kill, oh yeah, we've got the past all worked out. We understand it. Here is what we teach in schools. This is what our friends in the media report. This is the fat. It's not the fence. We know nothing. It's there's, there's been so much lost, so many missing pieces of the puzzle that we're, you know, desperately trying to stitch together and it's important.

Speaker 4:          02:05:20       I think that we actually do get some clarity on events like this because we still live on this planet and we have kids and we have a future and we want to, we want to, hopefully we wanted one of those big boys comes our way. Well that's right. But again, I come, I come down to this, which is, which is that we are not dealing with gloom and doom and the end of the world. We're dealing with a problem that humanity should be confronting. We should not be sticking our heads in the sand. We should be confronting this problem. And that's why I support the work of the comment research group because they are the only people right now who are confronting this problem. And really getting to grips with it. We should all confront, I mean, we should absolutely all support them and confront it because this, if something like this can happen once, what's, but what really makes sense is how many stories of floods there are an ancient times and how many parallels there are there are and how many there are from North America? Dozens.

Speaker 3:          02:06:14       Dozens. Yeah. It was the, um, Caitlyn, um, the Indian artist who spent 30 years or so pre civil war, I think maybe a decade after the civil war painting Indians of different tribes. And he wrote a book called last rambled. So amongst the North American Indians. Very, very interesting book. But what really is interesting to me when I read the book years and years ago was his final conclusion of the book. He says, after all of these different customs and traditions that have been handed down amongst these tribes, they all have one thing in common. They all have a memory or a story of a gigantic world destroying flood. And he and he, this is included tribes down into Central America that he visits. It did,

Speaker 4:          02:06:52       I believe the Americas are the repository that the native American peoples who have been subjected to so much destruction over the years, they, in their mythology, their traditions, their memories, they keep more of this than almost anybody else. It's, it's re, it's really tragic what has happened in the Americas from the time of the Spanish conquest, the deliberate destruction of knowledge that, that, that the terrible, horrendous abuses that native American people suffered. They are our wisdom keepers. They are the people who pass down the oral tradition and remembered the past. So not only do we have cataclysms wiping the human memory, but we ourselves actively get involved in the human memory and wipe it. We rub it out, the burning of the Maya courtesies by the Spanish thousands and

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       thousand God knows what was in those documents. You know, we might have had a whole other story about ourselves if we could have had access to those, but instead, where this destructive cannibalistic species that just goes and dismisses everything to bits,

Speaker 5:          02:07:49       it's a weird impulse that human beings have is when they move into an era and they take over at one of the things they like to do is destroy their icons, destroy everything that's going on with Isis and all these ancient Buddhist sort of structures. Thousand plus year old, beautiful sculptures obsolete and they're blowing them up. You know? And and yelling, praise God while they're doing it. It's really very bizarre. It's a very bizarre inclination that we have, but it's so, it's almost like we don't want people to know, you know, it's, it's a bizarre, almost human instinct to wipe out the past and just to constantly keep moving forward. There's some trauma. Is there some collective trauma, some deeply, deeply suppressed memory? Could be that we can't quite confront. That's, that's exactly the thought I had because I think that that's the one way, one of those areas where Vela Lucovsky finally really nailed it, was mankind in Amnesia that somehow we carry this, the trump cause once you begin to get, get a handle and you get to get the picture of these events as they occurred and did occur and would have been experienced by our ancestors, you've got to understand what would it be like to see your entire world completely obliterated starting over again from basically a bear and mud field.

Speaker 5:          02:09:01       That's essentially what these people were faced if they lived at all. And so few probably did because here we are. But you know, again, the evidence is emerging of major cultural collapse. If you had a guess, what percentage of the population of human beings, just as obviously just to gas, but how many do you think were wiped out? Half of them. Three quarters of them. I don't think that would be unrealistic. No, it doesn't seem like it would be. And if it was that number and those people, that's enough for people to survive. And if it was that number, boy, what a strange fucking mythical past.

Speaker 2:          02:09:35       The other thing to bear in mind is in the world today, our world, we have an advanced civilization. America, you know, Germany, the industrialized technological countries, and we have coexisting with them in South America, in the the, the, the Namibian desert, we have hunter gatherers. So the, the notion that hunter gatherers and an advanced civilization might coexist in the same epoch of history should not be strange to us because we are doing that today. And that's what I would suggest happened before 12,800 years ago before the cataclysm of 12,800 years ago, that there was a fairly advanced civilization that was capable of mapping and exploring the world, creating gigantic works of architecture and it coexisted with hunter gatherers and who were the ones who survived the catechism? The answer is the ones who survived the cataclysm where the hunter gatherers, not the sophisticated peoples. A few of them survived and they then settled amongst the hunter gatherers and tried to transfer some of their knowledge and skills to them and it's the same today.

Speaker 2:          02:10:41       If we, if we were to have a repeat of the younger dryas cataclysm today, I don't think that people from Los Angeles or London would be amongst the leading survivors. I think the survivors would be people like the hunter gatherers of the Amazon rain forest because they are in the business of surviving. That's what they do. It's not a mystery to them. It's not even a problem. They do it. They do it all the time. They would, they would carry the human story forward and 10,000 years from now, their descendants would be telling a myth about how there was once a great civilization on this planet so advanced that they could even go to the moon. They could fly around the planet, they could speak to one another on other sides of the earth, but they did something wrong. They, they fell out of harmony with the universe.

Speaker 2:          02:11:26       They ceased to where their prosperity with moderation. That's actually a line from Plato about Atlantis. Wow. And the universe slap them down. So there would be a differential survival rate. Those who were, I would say that those who are more technologically advanced or less likely to survive because they depend on a complex, interrelated network of skills and any individual on his or her own, most of them. But you are different Joe, because you do know how to survive. But a lot of people don't know how to survive, how to survive. I'd most likely you've worked at it, you know, I'm not that good at it, but most of us, most of us haven't even worked out at the time. We haven't got a clue. Let me fucking open everybody's eyes to all these people that think the, you could just go out there and shoot animals and stay alive. Good fucking luck. You're, you're probably screwed if you have a rifle. Even if you have a rifle, you're probably screwed. If you have a bow and Arrow, you're going to fucking starve to death. Right? It's an extremely difficult, yes. To get clothes, you know, and yet hunter gatherers for thousands and thousands of years have succeeded in doing that. Like the, the, the, the bushmen of the Kalahari,

Speaker 6:          02:12:28       less humans and more animals. Right. I think that's also part of the rub. Okay. It's like we're dealing with just one of the terrible things we've done is taking these giant swaths of land and made them entirely inhabitable for wildlife. Like cities like you, you, when you w how many people grow food in the city, then what is the percentage that even one 10th of 1% of people in the city grow their own food? Probably not. Probably not even that. So you have these massive essentially deserts with, we're no wildlife exist other than predatory species like coyotes and ravens and things like that that take, and then you, you, you go out from there and then you have these vast farmlands. The only benefit of the vast farm lands is the amount of deer that exists now as greatly more than when Columbus landed. But it's because they've almost become an agricultural animal.

Speaker 6:          02:13:16       It's almost like they're almost a domesticated animal. There are free, wild domesticated animal. Like I have a friend who has a farm in Iowa and when you go there, it's very strange because he's got these wild giant 300 pound forest horses running around his backyard. I mean they're, they're fucking everywhere. There's all these giant deer and when we were there, it's what's called the Rut. So all these, the, they're very horny. So the big bucks who usually hide, they show themselves. I'm like, this is a crazy place. Like there's all these wild animals that exist along with people and even in an a game rich place like that, it's incredibly difficult to get to one. And you'd have to have vegetables, you'd have to have your own vegetables. So let's imagine a situation where all the resources of our cities, all the, all the amenities, all the infrastructure are gone.

Speaker 6:          02:14:02       Most of us are fucked. I would say radically. I would say. In fact, our civilization, which appears so strong is actually very, very fragile. Extremely. It just a little push. It's like when you look out the window and you're like, wow, that's the outside. No, that's a piece of glass. You're outside knocked that piece of glass in your outside, you know, the effortless it is. It just seems impenetrable because you know, you pulled the shades tied and you set your alarm clock and sleep. You're sleeping next to the glass. Yes. Like hilarious. You feel confident and yet you're sleeping next to a piece of fucking glass. Credible complacency and arrogance of modern civilization that we are the apex and pinnacle of the Human Story. That we're the best that's ever come and, and, and that's a danger. Mythologically that is a very dangerous place to be when you start imagining yourself as the apex and the pinnacle of everything.

Speaker 6:          02:14:54       That's precisely when the universe reminds you that you are not that at all. Yeah. It's a very weird existence that we have where we just sort of look at how things are right now and we can't imagine things being any different no matter what, whether it's people that have to come to the realization that they had been injured, like someone breaks their leg and all of a sudden it just doesn't compute. Like, how come I can't walk anymore? Well, your reality is now shifted and this reality that we have here with this fairly healthy earth could shift at any moment that the yellowstone volcano is the one that's been freaking me out the most over the last few years. Another big

Speaker 3:          02:15:32       issue. Yeah. An interesting parallel would be if we look at smaller, what happens in smaller catastrophes like we've seen today, when we look at the, um, at, for example, when Katrina hit and hit New Orleans, right? It was almost as if the human species separated into two subspecies. You had one group of people that rose to the occasion and did heroic things. They organized and they saved people spontaneously. You know, because the government was conspicuously absent for five days, the first five days of the Katrina disaster. And here you had a major flooding of, of New Orleans, and, and you had people spontaneously organizing and performing these heroic actions of, of saving their fellow man and, and doing just stupendous things, superhero type things. But then you had another segment of the population. It just went completely barbaric and you had mass rapes and you know, smashing

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       of, of businesses and looting and in, and just people running in wild, complete, unrestrained gangs just in just committing violent acts at random. So,

Speaker 2:          02:16:43       and America, the richest country on earth did not manage that crisis. Well, no, I mean it was very, and that was a little crisis by comparison with what we talked.

Speaker 5:          02:16:51       Can you remember when Kanye West go on TV? George Bush does not like black people. I don't remember that. But yeah. George Bush, I think it was on day four. George Bush flew over in Air Force One and look out the window. It's wave. Yeah. Yeah. Give people hope. But there's, there's a lesson lessons in those kinds of events. Sure. Yeah, we're not prepared. And we have to extrapolate from that. And, and you know, if you, if you go back and we will, you know, I oftentime is a thought exercise. Think how, how would we respond if we knew that there was a high probability of a younger dryas type event or series of events impending in our future? What would you do to start drinking or, well it all depends on lead time. It all depends on lead time. If it's a 10 day lead time, my [inaudible] not going to be able to shoot a rocket up there and man fire up that Dubar again unless I go hard.

Speaker 5:          02:17:40       Go hard to the end. Yeah, 10 days but 10 years or 20 minutes, then we can do some stuff. Then we can do some stuff. The real scary thing is there's two scary things. One, uh, if you survived cause he's like, fuck. You know, if you, if you really did survive and everybody else was jacked and all of sudden you're dealing with some mad max type reality where people are starving to death and they're very desperate and they become almost like animals. That's entirely inside the realm of possibility. Well that's what we learned from Katrina or the other terrifying possibility is that you leave the future of civilization up to those other people cause it tastes survive and they have kids and their kids survive. And somehow or another, somewhere along the line we get better and better at understanding our place here, which is what I think has happened and all it would take is one, I mean this is as much as people are complaining right now, as much as there's riots in the streets because of, or excuse me, uh, protests in the street, some rights apparently, but over the president elect with this time is it represents the greatest time in history when it comes to safety, when it comes to knowledge, access to information, the way we understand each other.

Speaker 5:          02:18:47       I don't think it's ever been better as far as, as long as we know

Speaker 2:          02:18:50       we have everything at our feet. Yeah, there's the, there's incredible potential in modern civilization. The, but the problem is that there's also very rigid mind control. The way that our society's work, it's turning people into drones. People, people brought up to believe that their only purpose in existence is production and consumption. That the people forced to fit into a sort of narrow place in the machine, mass media beaming, you know, messages at us at us all the time. Even the concept of democracy is absurd when you don't, when you don't have complete transparency, when there are secrets, when things are hidden, how can the people vote? You know, with the clear, with clear minded out a lot is being hidden from them. That's not democracy. Democracy is in fact invest in, in mind control. Most unfortunate development.

Speaker 6:          02:19:38       Well I, I wonder how long it's going to take before the rigid mindsets that are in place right now and this idea of this resistance to change that we were talking about when it comes to science, when it comes to accepting this, uh, asteroidal impact theory. And I think that exists in politics. I think it exists in religion. I think it exists socially, the way we approach relationships and friendships and just all of it is evolving in front of our eyes. I was watching a movie last night. I'm not another teenage movies said what it is. Is that what it's called? And I was live tweeting it. So smoking pot and writing and sometimes I just like to have the TV on and not listen to it. Just just sometimes I like to see some things when I'm just writing things sometimes. I know that last night I chose to do it that way and I just got so enamored in this weird movie from 2001 this is the movie felt like a time machine.

Speaker 6:          02:20:32       It was like I was watching this culture that does not exist anymore. It's one of those like a teenager movies where like in college and they're drinking, there's a lot of naked women and really racist, sexist humor and it's really crude and goofy and stupid. And I'm like, this is so bizarre because they, this doesn't exist anymore. And this kind of film like this is like a, this is like Al Jolson with black face on or something. And in a way it's like a cultural time machine. Like you get to go and for a brief moment see like this comedy that somebody can cocked it in 2001 which seems so recent, but it's such a, in that film you get evidence of this weird cultural change. I shouldn't say weird, massive cultural change that's happened as far as the where we're allowed to joke around about things and if there's some racist shit in that movie like racist and sexist Shit and violence like men punching women in the face and shit like that. He just can't really do in a comedy today and that's only 15 years ago and what, what is it going to be like if we can avoid getting hit by a rock blowing ourselves up. Yellowstone, blow it up in our face if we can keep going. I think we're on a great path. I think our lists of where people think about the president elect, and

Speaker 2:          02:21:47       I think we're on a great path. It's a hazardous passed it path. It's a, it's a path where the future is not a tall certain but but humanity is at one of those moments, one of those crossroads where you kind of stand on the edge of an abyss and and you don't quite know what lies ahead and we can take a really great path out of this or we can take a really horrible path. And the, I think the key issue is that we do actually have choice. It doesn't have to be that way. I see a lot of positive, a lot that's positive out there out there in the world. I do think people are waking up. I think they are questioning old structures. They're refusing to put up with the bullshit any longer. More and more people are doing that as happening in the realm of politics is happening in the realm of dealing with the big corporations.

Speaker 2:          02:22:31       It's happening in the realm of investigating the past. We're just not going to be told what to think anymore. That's encouraging. But then on the other side, there are huge efforts being put precisely into making people think in certain ways, whether it's the advertising industry, whether it's political messages. And so we have to be aware of that. And it could go, it could go down the drone path. I mean like the b, the beehive path, which would be it. Why even bother to be human if your society is turning you into a worker drone in a a beehive life existence or it could go down and expansion of consciousness and, and, and the realization of the incredible, beautiful potential of the human race. That's where it's going. I'm optimistic, I'm very optimistic.

Speaker 5:          02:23:13       Beautiful to hear because this is a time like I was watching the John Oliver show. It's a great show on Hbo, Very Funny Guy and is very left wing, uh, leaning as as his show. But they had this fuck 2016 thing where they were just naming off all the horrible things that happened in 2016 and then just saying goodbye to this terrible year. And I'm like, yeah, I have a lot of good shit happened this year too. There's a lot of fantastic discoveries, a lot of interesting observations. A lot of people learned a lot of things in 2016 as well and I think that

Speaker 2:          02:23:45       quite a number of American states have made cannabis legal. Yes, that's, I think there's a huge develop,

Speaker 5:          02:23:50       it's, it's also a big, it's going to be a big factor in our cultural evolution. It really well, well it was a big factor in the 60s it was a huge factor in in effect what happened. You had a very closed conservative society and then you had an outside shock in the form of the psychedelic drugs. They came in and completely stirred up everything in art and music and fashion and even into scientific concepts of, of our place in the universe and time and space and in so many ways that had just a major impact on the direction that our society when and what would be the equivalent today or in our near future in terms of an outside shock that would suddenly wake people up would be another event. Another 10 goose government and based upon everything that I've seen, it would suggest that events like that are going to happen and probably within our lifetime and when it does happen, especially if the message of the story has been out and enough people have heard it, 5% of the people are 10% of the people are aware that there is this major impending potential paradigm shift and then we have an event like that.

Speaker 5:          02:25:06       An event like Tunguska 1908 I think that's all it would take because the, the magnitude of that event would have been such that it occurred today and you had anywhere from a million to 2 million people instantly wiped out or a whole city instantly annihilated

Speaker 3:          02:25:25       from a thing, from a shot, from space. What effect would that have on, on the planetary consciousness

Speaker 2:          02:25:31       and which with this latest exercise, NASA coming late to the party finally seems to be thinking about that. What happened there? What happened if la is hit by, you know, a 350 foot diameter,

Speaker 3:          02:25:41       right. And after the comment is because we'll, when the, when the, the probability models for a tin Guscott type event were first laid out in, in the fifties and sixties and into the 70s, it was pretty much determined that it was like something that would happen once a millennium, once every couple of millenniums, then it sort of got contracted to once every few centuries. You know, it may be that it's actually much more like one or two a century or maybe even perhaps clustered events where you may have three or four or half a dozen of those type events occurring over very short window of time. But an event like that happening, not one that would be caused the extinction of civilization by any means, but an event like that that could wipe out a thousand square miles of landscape completely, um, in an instant would have a major effect. I think on the people of this planet.

Speaker 3:          02:26:34       It would focus minds. It would focus minds in a way that nothing else would. And I, I, it's not to me is it pessimistic to say that might be what it's going to take or is it just realistic? I don't know. Well, I think it's like the, the massive impact versus the slow trickle effect. I mean, is it going to happen eventually or is it going to happen in one gigantic swoop because of an event like a asteroidal impact where it kills a bunch of people and we wake up to the fragility of our existence.

Speaker 2:          02:27:01       But either way, it's a waking up of, of, of humanity and that is in process that is happening. That is in process. Now look as a, as a Brit observing what's been happening in America as an outsider, I'm enormously encouraged by the legalization of cannabis movement that is, that is taking place here and, and, and what it and what it all means. Sure. I liked to smoke a joint, but this is not about getting high. It's not about recreation. What this is about is recognizing the sovereignty of adults to make decisions over their own bodies, their own health and their own consciousness while doing no harm to others. That's what it's about. And that's a really fucking important issue. That is, for me, that is the most important issue because if we live in a society that is not prepared to recognize adults sovereignty over one's own body, in one's own consciousness, then that cannot be a free society in any meaningful way.

Speaker 2:          02:27:48       And so I applaud the people of America in those states who have voted for full legalization. That's a brilliant thing to do, and that's going to have an impact around the world because the war on drugs, all the ideology and lies about cannabis are all going to be proved wrong. We're going to know that the emperor wears no clothes, that you can legalize cannabis and civilization does not fall apart as the war on drugs lobby had been telling us for ages. It's going to, it's going to change everything. And it's a beautiful thing because it's the American people. Whereas the American state America as a governmental state

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       presence on the world stage has been the dark force behind the war on drugs. So it's, it's, uh, to me a beautiful thing that is the American people's state by state who are winding that back and saying, we will not put up with this shit anymore. I think when you were talking about earlier is really important too. We were talking about different factions of our civilization or creating it. To this day, they're still creating disinformation and still trying to mislead people. But I think that goes to what we're talking about before where it's a system and systems protect themselves and I think that they develop almost a consciousness of their own. It's scary in a way. Yeah. Yeah. Big bureaucracies arm, the bureaucracies, they got to kind of personality. Well, even when there's no financial stake in it, there's just a social stake. Like what you're seeing right now with the left versus the right.

Speaker 6:          02:29:09       Like there's some people, like my friend Wanda Sykes just got booed off stage at some thing last night apparently when she went on some anti trump rant and then, and people got super upset at her. There's these systems that are in place. It's there. There's this, uh, Wa almost like wanting to fight. Like it's not, it, it sets us up in this bizarre team mentality with his left, protects its ideas of the future and the right protects its ideas. And I'm watching these people go at it back and forth on social media and it's toxic. And I don't like to use that term because it's so compromised by, you know, toxic sexuality or toxic masculinity is so many uses of that word in our culture. But I think that this desire to fight with each other and be deeply unpleasant, really horrible, hurtful, ghastly things. They just see it so often and it really, I mean vile and from the left to as well as the right, the left is the right word.

Speaker 6:          02:30:04       Exactly. And I think that we have to resist the urge to fight. I think this is when people push too far on the left. That's when the alt right emerges. When people push too far on the right, that's when the left comes up and you know, and that's when you know Kent state emergency, you have all these weird factions duking it out that have so much in common and a lot of times the things that they don't have in common, it's either because of an ignorance or it's because of an ideological dispute or a lack of communication. And I think if those three things are in place, at least open lines of communication, which is also fostered by marijuana and it gets these people talking openly and vulnerably about these things and you find out that a lot of our misgivings and our misunderstandings about each other or just misconceptions, miscommunications and we will even if we disagree on things. I have friends that disagree on a lot of stuff with, but we're very close. Yeah, because we're all, you're allowed to have different opinions. Of course. That's what makes the world interest. It doesn't have to be we hand at each other because one weekend is land. Listen to somebody else's opinion with empathy rather than with hatred or anger. We have. We're too, it's too attractive to be on a team like the fucking mason.

Speaker 6:          02:31:17       Yeah, it is, man. It's, it's too attractive. It's too attractive

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       and we love, I mean, we love city versus city. We'd love that. We love when you know, Chicago is going to take on Cleveland folk you, we'd love that. The tribal, the tribal thing. We, you know, we, we've, we've not really evolved out of that. We've changed our social structures, but we're still tribal tribal mentality. Nationalism is just tribalism writ large. Solid. It really is. Just like I was religions. Just a coat with a lot more people. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Should we look at one more? Yeah. We could look at as many as you want, man. Oh, roll the party. What do you got? Yeah. Let's see. The next one. Back to the flood. This is the place that I didn't get to take. Graham, can I really pay more? I really wanted to take you here. Let's see it. Let's see it. So you're going to see it second best.

Speaker 5:          02:32:01       Okay. Possibly did. This is the potholes. Oh Shit. Look at that. This is crazy. This will, we're looking at folks that, people who are just listening in, you have to go to the youtube now cause this is insanity. This is as close a like an art for a dummy like me to look at something like that and then go, oh fuck he for, yeah, that's definitely a river. The river carve that and cable. What you're looking at there is a gigantic extinct set of cataract like you would find it Niagara Falls, but to use grams term writ large, we're looking at a ridge. We're looking east. The tsunami wave that swept down over these four states. One branch of it swept off to the west. This particular branch of it was 400 feet deep. When it hit this ridge and what it did was it spilled over the ridge in.

Speaker 5:          02:32:56       Down here in the foreground you see the modern day Columbia River from the top of the ridge where you see the, the, the agriculture and the landscape down to the river's about a thousand feet. So you basically have to picture, you've got this huge sheet of of water three to 400 feet deep. It's rushing over in. It finds a low little the lowest spot within this ridge and that's where it starts focusing its energy and as it does, it begins to just strip away the rock. Now what you're looking at here is this cataract complex. It's about five miles across and the water came in. You'll see you've got those kind of curved finger lakes at the top and there's tunnels. Those are potholes. Hot holds are formed by underwater turbulence and in in a flood. This swiftly moving with this much turbulence, you literally have 40 secular Eddie's high intensity, high amplitude, high energy, underwater tornadoes, literally underwater tornadoes.

Speaker 5:          02:33:56       Now these underwater tornadoes are typically in this case about a half a mile walk. Oh my God. You're spinning at a high rate of speed and they're right there. They're probably 600 feet deep because the water pouring over the ridges at least 200 and you can see what it's done to the bedrock. Anybody listening you gotta you gotta look at this. You have to look at this and then listen to the scale. This is, this is a gigantic scar in the landscape of which there are hundreds, uh, around this, this region, the exact location. Randall, this is potholes cataract, right? The exact location. Um, plan he wants to get to it, which we were in Washington state still. Yes, we're in Washington state, central Washington. It can be right on the Columbia River. Um, just below a Naturi. Okay, well we saw that. We saw that huge, that huge erotic, yes.

Speaker 5:          02:34:45       Giant 18,000 ton Baldet brought there and chained in an ice bag, an ice bag floating on the flood. Carry a nice bag. The size of an oil tanker carrying an 18,000 ton boulder carried on the flood grounds 700 feet at La Valley side rest there. As the flood waters recede, the ice melts away and the boulder is left sitting there of that boulder in a sec. What did the people back in this part of the country? What do they think about this? Well, you know, they're only just catching on to what they're sitting on top of cheese. This the first time I went out here in [inaudible] 98, there was the, the, the Ice Age floods institute. And I went to their only location, which was a, which was in the better business bureau in Moses Lake, Washington. And it was, they had one room in the back of this better business or no chamber of commerce, Chamber of Commerce.

Speaker 5:          02:35:35       And there was two elderly ladies in there who are basically the, the overseers of the group. Now there's about two dozen chapters and every year there's several guided field trips, uh, led by geologists who are studying this in their off time. And I've been on a number of these just to participate and get the, the access to the geologists in order to pick their brains. Um, but this is, this is very close to um, Wenatchee, Washington. So if anybody's wanting to find this on google earth, this is a google earth image. Now what we're going to open book before we leave the Google Earth image, I was going to explain that you've got those, you got those. See those lakes, those, there's meandering lakes up. What? You got to pictures? You've got a sheet of water coming and as it's coming over this ridge, it's beginning to selectively erode into fault lines and cracks within the bedrock.

Speaker 5:          02:36:25       Can you picture that? The water is going to naturally try to go into those low spots where there's cracks and fissures and it'll start going from a sheet into channeling what goes from sheet to a channel. Then then that spills over the ridge and in the middle you see this, it's called a rock blade. See that the rock played? Is that that that, yes, that's it right there. Separating the two alcoves. If the flood, he'd continued for another few days, that rock blade would have been gone and you would've had a single alcove up there. Now in the next as, as this proceeds, what we're going to do with, we're going to go down and we're going to be right at the head of the rock blade right there. Yeah, right there. We're standing right there, so now you're going to get to see as the drone is about to take off, you're seeing the landscape.

Speaker 5:          02:37:14       We're looking to the east in the direction of those finger lakes and I guess the soundtrack, is it not playing in the sound? Not, oh there we go on here. A little Toccata and fugue in d minor. Ooh, okay. And the landscape opens up. So you're on that rock blade. We're on the rock blade right there. So now you can begin to see the scale of this thing that we were just seeing from google earth. Well now the way when you describe it, I mean I would have just looked at it and go, wow, that's kind of cool looking. I would have never have thought, oh, that was obviously created by water pouring through. That's the problem is because we haven't had the scale of perception, it took Brett's 25 years to put the pieces together. We'll also, we haven't been able to take these sort of high resolution photographs, drones right above it till recently.

Speaker 5:          02:38:06       Yeah, that's, it gives us a whole other insight. I mean it used to be $1,000 an hour to get up there and the helicopter. Now you can fly a drone around, you know, with the phone. Yeah, exactly. Go pro on it. Right here in the middle ground, you see that big hole that's about 200 feet in diameter. That's, that's a pot hole that was created by this swirling vortex of massively turbulent water. Oh Shit. This is incredible. In other words, the evidence is all over the landscape, all staring us in the eyes. And it's only in the recent years that it started to make sense where we've, we've evolved the, the eyes to be able to see this. And so now by going out here with a drum, I've been over this landscape several times in a small plane to see it from that perspective. But now, like he just said, like graeme just said, now we've got a drone.

Speaker 5:          02:38:53       It can go up and see it from a whole different perspective. And, and now you can see, see the, see the man standing right down there on the rock. No. Oh, that little dude. Yeah. Yeah. That little, that little dude is six feet tall. He's not that little. I mean, on the picture. He's a little now. No. In real life, these are rs four inches and it's, it's, it's an illusion. What's to me, stunning. I mean this is really beautiful and cool and everything like that, but what's really stunning as the initial picture where it becomes so obvious that above picture where you see the farm land and that just, it's so obviously cut, cut, slice out of the landscape. I see the rest of it then as as the drone flies over. Yeah. So, and then we have what's called classic scab land. You see all these mounds, he's kind of lumps.

Speaker 5:          02:39:41       That's what, what are the scabs on the scab land? That's why it's called scab land. And again, it's flooding that causes it plucking, plucking material off the surface. Wow. This is incredible. And then there's water remaining. Yeah, they fill fill the potholes. Yeah. God, it's there. You get a song. My God. Are you get a sense of the Rock Blade? Well they, you get a sense of what the volume of water must have looked like when it was rushing through there. Right. And see this is just holy shit. We've looked at two features now, camera's prairie and potholes cataract.

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       We could sit here for the next 10 hours looking at dozens and dozens of these mega features. And you'll look at, there's a whole bar. This is a gravel bar down here. Over there. Okay. See, see the giant rep was on it. You see those? Yeah. I've never seen those reported in the literature. It may be that nobody's ever seen really seen him before or no one's ever paid attention. Nobody's ever paid attempt, but there they are. So how, what does mainstream science use to describe this? This sort of or mainstream archeology used to describe these features should be geology. Well, catastrophic archeology. Yeah. What? What would they, so they believe this is catastrophic flooding is, Oh, you just think it's a slower, I think it's lots of small catastrophic floods that not, not one, not one big catastrophic flood. And how, what kind of timeline are these geologists putting on us?

Speaker 1:          02:41:02       Oh, two or 3000 years. Yeah. And why did they think that? Well, because of the, the, the ice damned model and how much time it would take. See it gets complicated because until the commit research, there was no credible source of, uh, of heat that could melt that amount of ice and close that up. Now that's the new factor that's come into the equation. Now you look at, look at the people standing on the cliff edge there, the edge of the rock. Would you see him down there? Yeah. So now you get the sense of scale. What would survive again in the aftermath? Not that dude. So, no, not that dude. Not Dad. You or his buddies. Yeah. This is the crazy place, man. It's crazy to look at. It's just so when you were looking above it, like even here, I mean, you get a sense of it, but if you had just showed this to make quite honestly, I probably wouldn't have put piece that together.

Speaker 1:          02:41:54       But when you look at it, the original image, it's so blatantly obvious. Well that's, that's the thing now is we are in this position where we can, we can see it and when I take people out in the field, what I do is I, I prep them first by showing these images from NASA, the, the satellite photography to Google Earth imagery, aerial photography, then ground photography. And then you go out in the landscape and at that point you can start having this framework for understanding what you're seeing. Otherwise you just don't it, the scale of it is too vast. It's amazing. It's really amazing. You know, this is an adventure of exploration that we're, we're, we're just getting launched on this is, this is recovering, recovering the last, the last past of, of humanity. And if I may, I want to make a pitch again for the comments for the comic research group. If anybody, I think it's really important. It's not, it's not just a matter of funding their research. It's also a matter of sending a message that we, the people are prepared to take matters into our own hands and, and support those scientists who are working with open minds inquiring into the past. And whether, you know, give a dollar or $100 or whatever, any little counts. It, it says it's the voice of the people as much as the, that really,

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       that really matters. These guys, the common research group, they need their research funding. They have an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign. You can go to my website, press the comet research group banner. It will take you to a page with all the relevant links. Please consider supporting it. It's valid, it's worthwhile, it's worth the work and it has the potential to change the whole story of our past and our future.

Speaker 5:          02:43:33       It's a story that would be incredibly exciting to be a part of. And that's what I'm trying to get people to think, look, there's this thing happening and it really, it is democratic in its own way and you don't have to be some specialist or a thorough particular authority in some branch of academically approved science to begin to appreciate and understand this and you're a human being getting out into the field and seeing this kind of stuff firsthand. Um, getting it into the discussion and to debate and, and spending more time on this because it's, it's such an interesting story

Speaker 2:          02:44:07       and that's what the scientists, that the comment research group or offering that, that, that people who contribute, we'll participate in certain ways. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:44:14       That's awesome. The future. Well, we're, we're all, what I was going to say is we're all human beings. We're a part of this planet. We are pedestrians walking along at the, on that were, were being carried by this planet and all this stuff is all right. It's, it's your right to understand what the history of this crazy rock has gone through. Absolutely. This is amazing. Yes. Amazing stuff. Into perspective. To understand this is like this. For 12,000 years, this story has been written into the landscape of the earth and only now are we able to step back and begin to see the big picture in, in tandem with ever greater detail and what's emerging is really, it's a really wild tale, but the evidence is there to support it complete.

Speaker 2:          02:44:59       Wait and this is, I mean, this is, if, this is what I've, this is the story I've told him, magicians of the gods, this is, this is recovering this, this last memory.

Speaker 5:          02:45:07       It really is wild. Um, the, our, our time here on this planet has been confusing for so many reasons and one of the big ones is not a not understanding how we got here. And that's one of the reasons why your book I think is so important to me. Just give you this new perspective of how this sort of civilization emerged. Another problem I think we deal with all the time, uh, is light pollution. I think light pollution, if I see the stars, it's, I think it's really a perspective blocker in a big way.

Speaker 2:          02:45:35       No, it absolutely, it absolutely is rattled. And I were having a discussion earlier about how ancient cultures related to the cosmos as above. So below they felt sls connected with the cosmos. They made their monuments in alignment with key celestial bodies. They did it very carefully. There was a sense of bringing down the enchantment of the heavens onto, on, onto earth. In modern societies, we can't even see the stars. He live in the middle of the big city. The stars are gone. The light, the light pollution just blocks them out. You never think they're there and you forget actually that you're part of a majestic cosmos. The everything about

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       it is mystery. We are immersed in mystery from the moment we're born to the moment we're die and yet our society is telling us how it's all very prosaic and dull and it's just about production and consumption explained. She, you don't really need to worry yourself about it too much cause some authority somewhere has it all figured out and no one has it all figured out. It's not possible. I think everybody owes it to themselves to go out into the desert in the middle of when, when you know there's a stretch where the moon is not going to be out and there's going to be clear skies, especially if you live in southern California, you can get out to the desert pretty easy. Yeah, just get out away from all the cities and just look up and it'll freak you out. It'll freak you out because it's, it's one of those things that you kind of really take for granted because most of the time the sky is just a, a dark black featureless thing.

Speaker 1:          02:46:53       The little couple little white dots that don't, aren't really that compelling. When you get out there and you see the actual Milky Way itself, you go, Oh holy shit. We'll see. Now we could have, you know, every year there's probably a dozen high altitude events that could have been witnessed by ancient peoples that we are completely oblivious to. Right. Because of the, our urban existence because of light pollution because nobody is really looking at the sky. But these high altitude events would be essentially equivalent to like here or she Shima sized bombs going off 20 miles up and just outside. Yeah. It was basically like if it's in the daytime and you're not looking right up there, that's right. You're not going to say daytime and at night if you're living in the city, if you're inside the light pollution, by the time it happens, it's over.

Speaker 1:          02:47:38       But if you're out in a completely wilderness area where you've got, you know, visual access to the stars and you're aware of that and you're constantly aware of the presence of the sky, you're going to see much more of that kind of thing happening. Then if the cosmos decides to get a little bit more active, which it apparently does from time to time, suddenly the sky is now, uh, becomes a major factor in your, in your existence, your tribal existence, your cultural existence. Um, especially if in those episodes you have multiple, um, fireball type of ants that could be on the scale of anywhere from [inaudible], Guppta Tin Goose. And that's what clue in napier. That's their scenario is these clusters of, of that we enter episodes have been bodman when we up tossing through a filament of the tour, had meteor stream that's thick with heavy debris, asteroids have a kilometer of more in diameter.

Speaker 1:          02:48:35       Uh, when we entered those filaments were entering a period of episodic bombardment. When human civilization is at risk and according to their calculations, we are entering one of those filaments in the next 30 years. Jesus. And that's why we need to pay attention to this because 30 years is enough time to do something about it. If we apply the resources of our civilization to this, we can solve this problem. Let's look at a couple more pictures cause I'd like to get the picture of Graham. I want it too busy making new phones. They don't have time to fix the asteroid thing. Exactly. Need a photo.

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       Projects, images and holograms. That's my uh, my contention and it's going to take a little bit, but again, those are know the serious commercial talk of mining asteroids than is that is the way into this. That if they can, if they can, if they can see an economic return for them in that, then maybe they'll do the good thing actually for the human race. This have to be a manned expedition like Bruce Willis and then asteroid movie not necessary. Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:49:30       What's the image that will show? Well, uh, Jamie, why don't you go to the, the, the folder of the one we opened that folder of Awesomeness, the bolt, a folder. A folder of awesome. This. Yeah. Just let's start with a one zero zero seven what are we going to look at here? Well, we're going to look at some NASA stuff. Oh, cool. And then we'll look at a couple of google earth things and then we will look at a couple of us geological survey things and then we'll look at some photographs.

Speaker 5:          02:49:59       Five deals worth. Okay, let's do it. Holy Shit, this is, this is an early one of the early NASA photographs taken from 500 miles up, uh, back in the late seventies, actually. And what we got here is the two big scab land tracts that show two of the big meltwater streams that have left their, their scars in the landscape. So each one of those, um, is very roughly between 10 and 20 miles wide. And the bigger one on the right is probably 50 to 60 miles long, or actually a little bit longer net. But you can actually see that when the water swept down from the north out of British Columbia, it washed away 200 feet, roughly one to 200 feet of the existing top soil that had covered the basalt bedrock, right. Basalt bedrock by the way, that was originally formed by, uh, eruptions of the Yellow Stone Caldera interestingly, but so the water came down, swept away the, the, um, the topsoil and left the bear dark basalt exposed, uh, down below. The feature that we just looked at is not even really in Nis NASA photograph. It's over to the west. But let's go ahead to the next one, Jamie with the snake river down there, which is, um, where's the snake river? Snake River comes up out of Idaho and it joins the Columbia and then flows out to the Pacific Ocean.

Speaker 5:          02:51:27       All right. Then we got a google earth image coming up.

Speaker 4:          02:51:33       Oh, okay. Want to order cause there's just a lot, there's a lot in here. Oh, okay. Well tell me which number you want me to pull up. Pull up we 1008 one zero zero eight. The next one. What's going on with our TV? It keeps going off and on. That CV is not really made for the way we use it, so it doesn't like the inputs. I just turned it off so I can pull up the next one. Okay.

Speaker 7:          02:51:53       Hmm. Hmm.

Speaker 5:          02:51:58       There we go. So now we're getting actually a bigger view of, of the landscape. And you can see the two meltwater. That's a scab land tracks, I mean here and here. And then you have what's called green. No one can hear you if you do this. Is this, just tell me where it is. I get it. Okay. So there's the two scab land track. Then you've got the uh, Grand Coulee, which has that dark room and going up to Columbia river there. Grand Coulee dam is right almost. You almost had it. It's where the Columbia river suddenly gets skinny right there. That's grand coulee dam. That's the widest, the most massive concrete dam in North America. And it's impounding water. And Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake to about 400 feet deep right now. All of the area at the top, the glacier, the green mountainous area. This was all covered in ice and then over to the left, right there you have that Brown area and do you see the kind of semicircular arc of dark ground right there?

Speaker 5:          02:52:59       Yes. That is where a tongue of the ice came out of Canada and it stopped right there and when it receded, when it melted, melted back, what it did was it left all this rubble that can't really be farmed effectively. This it's called tail glacial till and where the glacier, where the glacier and did, that's called more Maureen, Maureen, and you can see it's circular where the glacier came and then coming right off the snout of the glacier. Do you see kind of up a ribbony that's a giant scar on the landscape that was formed by a meltwater stream coming off of that ice sheet. It's called Moses Cooley.

Speaker 4:          02:53:37       Hey Randall, I think we should keep in mind a lot of the audience aren't actually seeing the visuals on this tape. The takeaway is that all across the Pacific northwest is a landscape that has been utterly scarred and devastated by gigantic flood that took place. 12,008 it's left its marks everywhere and this is right. Yeah, right

Speaker 5:          02:53:54       near core de Lane, so cordileone is from that. That's the residue of this quarter lane right there. If people go to the Geo cosmic rex website or the sacred geometry international website, they can see most of the images that we're showing you. You'll see it. If they watched the youtube video, they can watch it and hear you talk about it at the same time. It's just the, the vast majority, probably 90% of our new, but just seeing the visuals right now, but they can and so they probably will so they can go to that and watch it. You can look down way down on the lower left is the potholes cataract, right. Go up a little up along the river. Come down south south, keep coming, keep coming. Stop. Look to the right of the river. That's what we were just, this man knows his landscapes.

Speaker 5:          02:54:41       To note to the right, to the right to the right, Jamie, Jamie, how dare you. Yeah. This, this whole area. So we get it. This whole, every area has been absolutely anon unequivocably undeniably you see this Joe, and you realize the scale of what we just looked at and now you're seeing that within this whole landscape there was essentially inundated. You're, you'll start to get the, the scale of the thing and that's what I'm trying to do here. If you joke and get the scale of this in your mind, I've accomplished something. I think I got it from that one image was a, that was a real mind blower. The right bolts. Yeah. The ripples. Yeah. There were all the ripples were real mind blower and then the, the other one with the farm land and then there's just massive channel cut into it. You kind of get it.

Speaker 5:          02:55:26       Yeah. Um, the ripples aren't even on this image there their way to the east. Has Anybody sat down with you and tried to dispute this? I mean the people that believe that this was a slow and gradual effect. Does anybody sat down and tried to debate you on this? No, that seems like something that would be really interesting to debate. I mean, I would love to see someone who's a geologist that, you know, the, I'm sure there's someone out there that is listening to this that may have a dispute with it. There is, I'm sure, but I would love to, I would love to see them talk to you about it and go over all the various things. The nuclear glass that they find, the uh, I mean all of it, all the top to bottom. Here's the thing, Joe, at this point, nobody is connecting the work of the, of the comic research group with the Missoula flood effects that we're looking at or, or rest.

Speaker 5:          02:56:14       Except except us. That's crazy. Most people were like, that's crazy. How's it possible? Because it's such an obvious, it's such an obvious connection and it really merits expos scares the shit out of me. What if you guys didn't exist? What if you guys would never born? What if you never wrote that book? And what if you never been freaking out about this shit your whole life? How would I know about many times in the human story as this happened where stuff has just not been explored that really need to put the pet sounds crazy to something like a Michael Shermer to a skeptical person. Well, I say to Michael Shermer, come on man, let's go spend a week out in that landscape. Well he does want to debate you. He wants to sit down and debate you Graham. Let's, can we set that up? We can set that up.

Speaker 5:          02:56:52       I will love it. That sounds, that sounds like it would be a good time in my mind. There's really no, no arguing with with this, this evidence, I mean overwhelming. And the question really comes down to at this point nobody disputes that there were catastrophic flood. The question is what was the mechanism? How many were there? How long would it take? How long did it take? Was it a bunch of catastrophic but smaller floods or was it back to Brett's original model of one giant flood? And I think the truth actually lies somewhere between the two and, and it, again, the geology gets complicated, but I'm writing it up so I will explain in detail what my thoughts are. And after, after having criss crossed thousands of miles of this landscape repeatedly and basically absorbed every piece of scientific literature every written on it, I've evolved some ideas about what could have happened here and how it happened. Well, I was a grown adult and I found out that North America, most of it was by, you know, what was it? 10 12,000 years ago was covered by a mile high sheet of ice. Yes.

Speaker 1:          02:58:02       Odd. I was a grown adult and I went, well, America roughly north of Minneapolis. Yeah. Yeah. And that was, that's common knowledge, right? I mean, everybody knew that. Anybody who's actually studied the history of it, but it never made it to my dopey head until I was a grown adult. And then I went, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. What the idea in my mind that this whole thing was covered just 12,000 years ago. It seems so incredibly recent. And by the way, that ice was more like two miles deep, could consider the weight of those ice masses pressing down. I mean, anything that was there before the ice came down would have been ground to powder and then as the ice cataclysmic, he melts everything below it is washed away forever so I can erase her for the world. That's exactly, that's a great phrase and eraser for the world.

Speaker 1:          02:58:47       And that is the thing that so many of the skeptics haven't factored into their thinking when you're going, well, where's the evidence? The evidence is you've got to understand is that we have to rethink the possibility of evidence once we know that there has been, these are racers of the world that have transpired and, and not just once, but I mean what we're looking at here is probably the most severe events in the last 5 million years and I have a reason for using that number 5 million. What's the reason? Well, the reason is is based upon the, the, the severity of the mass extinction. We have to go back 5 million years to find an extinction event of an equivalent level as what occurred at the younger dryas. It's funny because what I would call a kneejerk skeptical person would always say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

Speaker 1:          02:59:34       Is there anything more extraordinary than that image of those farmlands and that giant swath cut instead of land? That's, that is the, what is it? That's pretty right. Pretty extraordinary. And then the core samples, the core samples that show this massive fluctuation of temperature and we've looked at, yeah, in pre gout that coincides with the melting of the ice. Yes, yes. It's all there. Obviously all leads, even if someone like me, it leads to an event and this cataclysmic episode immediately precedes the time when we'd been told that civilization began. Yeah. That's the other point, which is really important. We had this huge punctuation mark and then civilization suddenly started to evolve. No, it was there before. This is a reinvention. Those hunter gatherers, like those people that you would wash and one of those shows where they survive in Alaska. Even watch those shows.

Speaker 1:          03:00:21       Yes, this shows a great life below zero s crazy assholes and live in those people would make it. Those people would make it and they would breed and they would carry on. Yeah. What does that, what does it say? 1012 you could just say it next day and age. I don't want to interrupt your Joe. No worries. No worries. Look at this. Wow. Okay. So that to me, I'm looking at this after what you've told me that looks like water that is sort of like receded and left these lines and this hillside. Thank thank you have a bath tub ring after Joe. You get in there and you take a bath and the water is basically brown with sediment. [inaudible] the way you've taken tub,

Speaker 6:          03:01:00       you leave in sediment and your tub. Hey man, how'd your quoting genesis and the water's prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills were cupboard. Wow.

Speaker 5:          03:01:10       Because I'm, you know, trying to pump the biblical flood model and the far from it. What I am trying to do is draw out pictures whenever I realized here's a great quote and it doesn't matter where it's from because there's so many flood legends you can quote from.

Speaker 6:          03:01:22       Well the biblical flood model is it is one of those, Smith's is one of those traditions that have come to want to thousands of traditions that speak of this. The whole ancestral memory of the human race is telling us that something terrible happened. It's also very unfortunate. That's all that's all connected with an ideology that a lot of people find problematic like that. There's this issues with that being, you know, religion of course colt or there's a faith based beliefs. We must have immediately realize the flood is not the property of the monotheistic religions that is found in every culture on it. Also in that a lot of these stories you're talking about massive translations from ancient Hebrew to Latin. The Greek and a lot is lost in the process and the you're dealing with. A lot of these stories were handed down from generation to generation for like what was it like a thousand years before the first version was ever ripped? Sedately absolutely. So all that's, I mean that is unbelievably fascinating.

Speaker 5:          03:02:16       Go to 1014 one zero one four and we'll see a topographic map. Ah, yeah. Whoa.

Speaker 6:          03:02:27       Now that you know, it's like it's crazy. It looks like something just wa like you had a sand castle or some flat sand set up and a wave came in and cut through it and then

Speaker 5:          03:02:40       pulled back. The wave came from the north and it's swept down over the landscape and basically carved and plucked and quarried and gouged and Gash that landscape and this is one of the places Graham and I went. If you look right in there, you'll see where it says grand part of Grand Coulee, G, r a n d right there with the D is we have a great video clip online of me and gray and we're looking at this actual Topo map right here and and then surveying the cataract around us. You'll also notice that there's a rock blade just like similar to the one that we just saw on the drone footage. See the Rock Lake and you recognize the alcoves now. Yeah. And if we go to the next one, we have a google earth image of 1015 of this feature

Speaker 5:          03:03:33       and there's the Google Earth emh. And for scale in the upper left hand, I've super imposed Niagara Falls at the, at the same scale. So you can see by comparison. Wow. Have you been to Niagara Falls, Joe? I went when I was a little kid. I honestly don't remember. I think I went when I was a little kid. I'll have to check with my mom on sensitive to see it. But you could. The here is that anybody looking at this and you know, if the folks look at the, um, the imagery on the online, the biggest waterfalls in the world. What Niagara? Not In terms of volume. No, but nor in terms of the African or something. Yeah. Or South American. Maybe Victoria Falls a Ted pans, you know, the highest or the greatest volume. It's about 200,000 between 150 and 200,000 cubic feet per second going over those false depending on the f, the flow of the river.

Speaker 5:          03:04:25       But the, the flow that came through here was about 350 million cubic feet per second and left this and uh, yeah, if you go in line on the Geo cosmic rex website, there's a video clip of me and Graham down there just just uh, by perch lake. May I ask you a question here? Yeah. Now if the water that was creating Grand Canyon or the Niagara Falls rather right up there, if that all receded and we could see the bottom, wouldn't it look similar to what you see in here? The one of Grand Canyon? No, excuse me, nine with Agora falls right there. Right above it. Right there. Yes it would, but on a smaller scale on a smaller scale, but like on a smaller scale, like some of the smaller features that you see right there, right? Yeah. And that's the thing you were saying. You're right, it's fractal.

Speaker 5:          03:05:10       The interesting thing about water erosion and sedimentation is its scale in variant. So you can look at features and coming up into pictures. Here I've got a beautiful example of scale and variants where you see the small version and the large version and it's exactly the same thing. That's why if you go into any geology text, they've always got something in the photographs like a a rock pick or a person standing there. Otherwise it's hard to get a sense of the scale of what you're looking at. Right. So my, my question though was that if that's the case, if you could drain Niagara Falls and it would have a similar feature set to what you're seeing on the ground there. Well, we know that Niagara Falls has been doing that for a long, long time. Years of work of the river at night holes right here. You're looking at a moment in time to unfold it in a few weeks.

Speaker 5:          03:05:54       Right? But how do we know that? Well for one thing to scale of it because if, if, if, because in other words, how long would it take Niagara to carve something on this scale? If it's taken Niagara 10,000 years, say to carve that, how long would it take a equivalent flow to carve this? But it will look like if you drained it though, what would it look like an equivalent to any of these things right here. For one thing, it's not basalt bedrock so you're not going to see quite the same type of erosion because really what you, what you've got to consider is that all different rock types of road differently. Also. Um, you know, what happens is you have regimes of flow so that what you have in in Niagara today is a lower flow regime which doesn't have anywhere near the type of turbulence or erosive potential is when you get water moving at 50 or 60 miles an hour.

Speaker 5:          03:06:46       One reason we definitely can know that this is the case is because we see the association with the giant current ripples. We see the boulders that have been plucked and quarried and some of them are 40 and 50 feet in diameter. You see, and we'll, we'll look at some of those, uh, coming up in the next, next picture. Do you have that image that you were talking about before of that one gigantic boulder that was carried on this? It's coming up. Okay. If we move quickly through here, we'll, we'll, we'll get to it. So go to go to um, 1017 and that will be from the ground view again with Niagara Falls super imposed for scale, the horseshoe falls, the Canadian falls superimposed for scale. Now basically that cataract at horseshoe falls is about 120 feet in height. The cliff wall of this giant cataract has about 400 feet high and then you see the beginning of the blade rock out there and the full extent of the thing actually goes all the way to the horizon, but we can't see that beyond there.

Speaker 5:          03:07:49       But this erosion goes all the way to the horizon to stone that cut into basalt hard columnar basalt that was extruded basically with the eruption of the Yellowstone Caldera. Long mill 15 million years ago basically, but then covered up by a couple of hundred feet of loss topsoil and then that was exposed when the floods came through. Um, go, go to the next 1018 and you'll see an example of some of the debris that was left behind by the floodwaters when they finally ceased. There's the step that you're looking at now. The bigger stuff there is 30 and 40 feet. Those, it'd be like four story buildings down there. So those are just washed away by this gigantic river that's just this, this write, this massive gigantic river moving 50, 60 miles an hour sweeps through their plucks and tears the bedrock and then wind up spigots finally get turned off. The water starts subsiding and this stuff that's being carried in air just gets left into wake.

Speaker 5:          03:08:53       Just like you're going to see any modern, smaller flood is going to leave material in its wake. The differences. This material is piles of boulders, the size of houses, gravel bars, two and 300 feet thick and three miles long, and you're all in it. So see, here's the, the answer to your question is, and this is what, how Brett's finally did it was by showing that it was the full suite of evidence. Take an integrally that created a picture that was undeniable to the skeptics. It was just, it was overwhelming because it was every piece fit together to perfectly to two. And there was no other explanation other than gigantic hydraulic events. And, and now it's a question of the detail, what caused them, how long did it take? And you know, that's where the controversy is now is amazing. It's amazing and terrifying. But what's cool about is it's terrifying, but everything's okay right now. Everything's okay right now now. So it's like you feel, ah, it'd be fine,

Speaker 3:          03:09:54       but maybe not. If something like this happens again, you have to ask what, what could be the change in, you know, in the human orientation to life on this planet. Like, for example, I remember the first Earth Day in 1970 right? When when this consciousness about, hey, you know what? Our existence on this planet is having an effect on this planet. Right? And at that point you see this whole environmental consciousness emerge that didn't exist before that, right? Well, I think maybe in the next decade or two we're going to see a new environmental consciousness that involves the recognition that this planet we live on is a very dynamic place and has been so, and is the key to decipher in a lot of mysteries, geological, cultural, historical and paleontological, biological, et Cetera, that this has been a dominant factor in the evolution of basically everything that's been going on on this planet, whether you're looking at millions of years or thousands of years, it's just, it's such a strange time to be alive where all this stuff is coming together.

Speaker 3:          03:11:01       All this information is being exposed and had an archive, has been, has been broken open and the stuff is spilling out and you don't know whether you've opened Pandora's box by letting it out, but it's all logical. And when this whole logical, easy to follow, it's all, I mean it seems like when, when it comes to like a step by step two nine one zero two nine coming up one zero two nine one I fell like I'm a Bingo guy. Now there's where he traveled about 500 miles south out onto the Utah, uh, Canyon. It's beautiful. And what you're seeing there is basically dry cataracts. Now that you've seen these cataracts, you can begin to recognize them all over the place. Now, this has not been acknowledged as being a cataract, but what you actually see when you look at the modern erosion is that these features are being slowly eroded and eaten away by the modern erosion.

Speaker 3:          03:11:57       And it's the different erosional regime altogether that creates features like this. And this is a vast scale of erosion here. And when you travel over the south west, that is the most striking thing that you're going to experience if you're, if you're, you know, in, in empathic with the landscape, which is that there's been this enormous amount of erosion. Now, I'm not saying that this enormous amount of erosion was all created by one flood, but I think what it is possibly saying is that when we go back over several million years, gigantic floods on this scale aren't that exceptional, that there's something to that from time to time. And See, here's the thing, this is completely removed from the glaciers. Any water that would have eroded this landscape was not coming from the glaciers. It had to have been coming from rainfall go. If you go to the next slide, Jamie went out, which is not a disconnected element because that because of the massive rain out that was, that resulted from the impacts on the ice cap.

Speaker 3:          03:12:55       What's this? This is Vollis call Doris. This is the largest volcanic Caldera and North America. Oh, it's 11 miles across. And here's what it was born out of a catastrophe millions of years ago, right? And then subsequent eruptions over hundreds of thousands of years of leftists feature. But what's interesting to us, here's what happened around 12,000 years ago. The entire Caldera filled up suddenly. And if you look at right about, if you look at it as a clock at about eight o'clock you can see a breach of valley coming off. You see that? Jamie, can you? Yeah, right there. That was the spill over. So at the same time, now get this at the same window of time that this, these flood events are happening up in Washington and Idaho and Montana. This caldera suddenly fills up with water and the water spills over the rim and cuts a canyon hundreds of feet deep.

Speaker 3:          03:13:53       Now, what could cause that to suddenly fill up with water and it's completely removed. It's not receiving glacial melt water. There's only one thing by default. And that would be rainfall. A lot of rainfall falling over days and days at a time. So if you go to the next slide, we'll see what sits down in the bottom of this valley is thousands of these gigantic rolled boulders and you know that their water transport it because they're round their role. That's what water does. It rolls these things. Now this is in New Mexico. See? So this is related to the spillway. The overflow of all called era, which has been dated to that same interval when the floods were happening up north, the same interval that now the comment is dating too. Is this coincidence or are the two related? I would say it would be very premature to dismiss it and say that they're not relating to that because as graeme just said, one of the once at one of the consequences of an impact, whether it's into the ocean or the ice sheet, is you're going to have extreme amounts of water vapor injected catastrophic Lee into the atmosphere, which is then going to rain out in incredible torrential downpours that might last for days at a time, and we'll along with that, water vapor is a tremendous amount of particulate mass and it's that right out that I would say close the erosion on the Sphinx and tells us that the Sphinx is 12,000 years old, 2005 you guys are freaking me out.

Speaker 3:          03:15:25       This is amazing. This is the most convincing argument yet that you guys have ever made for this because it's all, it's all been convincing. This is a, this is more compelling and then all the pieces with the go home together. Next slide, Jamie, which would be thousand and 32 which is to me a beautiful example of scale and variance. Oh Wow. Here we have the

Speaker 5:          03:15:49       modern snake river flowing into modern channel, and then we have the ancient flood channel and which you can see there the average annual discharge of the snake, 56,900 cubic feet, but the estimated flood that created the big channel is 40 million cubic feet. And now this flood actually was coming up, get this out of Utah. It was coming up. It was part of the giant Lake Bonneville of which the Great Salt Lake is, but a diminutive remnant. So the Bonneville Salt Flats, a Bonneville salt flats where the bottom of this gigantic lake that that filled the basins of north eastern Utah, and at the end of the last ice age, it's suddenly filled up very rapidly in spilled over a mountain pass to the north and then flooded the south. The the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho in anybody can see the snake river plain. If you go to google earth or any topographic map and it cut channels like this that ultimately led to the Columbia river, but interestingly the dating of this puts it again right in that window.

Speaker 5:          03:16:56       Um, so that window of 12,000, 800 to 11,600 years ago when everything changes, everything changes. And so what I'm showing you is just a little bit selecting random almost dots to show you that no matter where you look, you're going to see evidence of these, of these events imprinted into the landscape. Um, yeah, go to the next slide. 1033 and if you go down and you stand on that flood plain down there, you'll see the kind of stuff that got left behind. This is the sediment load being carried into flood. Wow. So you got what kind of powerful currents are necessary to transport and I'm standing in the canyon, it was cut by the flood. Those walls are 400 feet high. So what we would think of as being like little pebbles at the bottom of a stream and it gets moved around. Yes. Grand Scans is like sand grains on the bottom of a modern little creek or river set that humongous boulders.

Speaker 5:          03:17:57       Yes. And this is what a geologist or geomorphologists would call it, the bed load to stuff being swept along in, in the floodwaters reenrolled and tumble and geologists recognize this, but they think it took mainstream. Geologists think it took a long no, I mean the few geological, uh, papers had been written on this admit that it was a one big catastrophic flood. Wow. And what is their explanation for that catastrophic flood? Well, that Somehow Lake Bonneville rose up and, and Z, right. Breached him up pass and it's northern rim. But you know, is that possible in any way? Well, yeah, if you have enough rainfall prolonged over a period of time, days or weeks, um, that the whole body of water could have raised by 300 feet roughly. And then at that, you, again, you would need something like the commit impact to provide you with a source for that. Right. Because otherwise there's no other explanation for that kind of that kind of rainfall in it's known from the modeling of Oceanic impacts that yes, there would be unbelievable rainout in the aftermath of an oceanic impact. And clearly the same thing would, would follow in the wake of a, of an ice impact. What oceanic impacts that we have on record only a few of them. Um, there's one up by Sweden,

Speaker 2:          03:19:10       we were discussing also the possible Indian Ocean impact, possibly one in the Indian Ocean 5,000 years ago, which, which creates tsunamis on both sides of the Indian Ocean dated to about massive, massive tsunami disposit deposits. Um, and then again, this whole argument of the younger dryas cataclysm between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago. The strongest case is the focus of the science has been on 12,800 years ago, but there's a lot of interest in the 11,600 years ago as well. And the strongest suggestion of what caused that that sudden rise in temperatures accompanied by meltwater pulse. One B was a second encounter with more fragments of the debris of the comment. This time, the impact of not being on the North American ice cap, but in a major ocean, probably the Pacific, and that, that then puts a huge plume of water vapor into the upper atmosphere and shrouds the earth and creates the greenhouse effect that accounts for the radical rise in temperature that occurred 11,600 years ago. More science needs to be done on that. It's another reason why I want to see the comment research group funded because this is, this is important work. Goddamn is an awesome podcast.

Speaker 5:          03:20:25       This might be my all time favorite. Whew. Okay. Half a dozen more. Yeah, for sure. Let's roll. Okay. 1039 and this is here now. You'll be able to see actually a person in the, in the field of view next to one at a giant current ripple. And uh, there's a giant that's a giant current ripple field. We did see this one gram. This is the west bar. Um, all right, cool. Yes. If you go back one slide, we can see an aerial photo. I took years ago of West bar. It's three miles long.

Speaker 7:          03:21:01       Okay,

Speaker 5:          03:21:02       there it is. Whoa. And there's an airport down. The lighter colored buff stuff is a landing strip and the the, the, the, the uh, airport building, there is three stories tall. So this whole feature is um, three miles long and the ripples here are on the same scale as the canvas prairie ripples that we just looked at. Of course, this is in central Washington, the other one was in Montana. So again, you, as we begin to place these event nodes around on the map, we can begin to see the outlines of a really, really huge event and all of this is going on at the same time. You've got to understand the data to the same time. All this is dated to the, the the same time that you think the impact took place and all over

Speaker 3:          03:21:46       that coast. The only dates that we have that are hard dates are a volcanic ash, primarily from Mount Saint Helens that date at 13,000 years. But they use that as a baseline and then assume that there was multiple floods and each flood was separated by 50 to a hundred years, and what they've done is they've gone from Brett's his original model of a single flood into a dozen floods into 40 floods and now up to 80 or 90 floods, which I disagree with. But on the other hand there were, see, I think you have to understand this in two phases because the impact phase is going to melt a whole lot of ice all of a sudden, but it's not going to melt all of it. It's going to leave a huge amount of residual ice in the aftermath. Now what we see is that particularly after the 11,600 year ago event, at that point, the whole planet comes right out of the ice age inexplicably.

Speaker 3:          03:22:42       That's the end. That's the end of the IC at the beginning of the Holocene. It's over and, and basically what we're seeing there is that there's a great deal of, of heat. Suddenly that's brought the planet out of the IC. It does not convert revert back into the ice age like I did at the 12,900 event. See. So what we then have is that in the aftermath of this event, the whole climate of the earth has been completely altered. The whole balance of nature has been completely altered from before these events to after these events. But what you have now is a lot of residual ice that takes about two or 3000 years to melt away. So say levels continue to rise. Sea level of continual work to rise and the melting of this ice produces some pretty big floods, but not on the scale of what we're looking at here.

Speaker 3:          03:23:32       And I think it's my personal opinion that there's a confusion between the two different flood regimes. And, and I'm going to document all, I'm writing all this up in detail as a, as a, like as a thesis to explain, um, my interpretation of, of the phenomena over 20 years. But let's go to, um, that would be so important. I would love to see people really go over this with a fine tooth comb because it's so compelling. She saw amazing, like just this image itself. It's just wow, what would it, what kind of power and force would it take to create those rebels, those 50 foot high ripples all over the place. Miles and miles and miles of them. Yeah. And, and she nothing, since that event has really affected them, they're still sitting here as these gigantic monstrous fossil features in the landscape. Now when they do core samples on that stuff, what do they find out? Like as far as the dating of it, like if they get to the bottom and one of those ripples, well you, you've got to find, you've got to be able to find organic material in there. And to the extent that there's organic material, it basically all dates from the end of the ice age. The problem is, is when you have a flood like this coming through, it's sweeping up everything in its path, including forests

Speaker 5:          03:24:43       and animals. So if you've got a bone in there or a piece of wood deck doesn't necessarily mean when the flood happened.

Speaker 4:          03:24:51       It's not a nice layer of sets, layers of sediment. It's a jumbled mess. Chaotic, chaotic mass. It's not like you could just go right

Speaker 5:          03:24:59       dig into the side of that hill at that same level and find something that's organic and absolutely dated it to that cause that's all stone, right? Right. It's Boulder's. It's, yeah. If you saw a cross section of one of those ripples, it's, it's just a jumbled, chaotic mess of everything from the finest sand and silt up to boulders, the size of cars and even houses and stuff. Just yeah. That's so crazy. Go to 10 41 and we'll see an interesting uh, artist's rendition by um, Edward Rio who did all the illustrations for the jewels, original Jules Verne books and he did a version for an, a straw straw geology text. Um, what was the guy's name is skipping me right now, but I thought it was an interesting image because it basically shows an event on the scale of what we're talking about. And what's interesting here is you see that the torrents are carrying icebergs and in this one iceberg and the foreground, I call it grams rock.

Speaker 5:          03:25:56       From now on, it's going to be, I have officially turned named Greg is carrying a gigantic grant and I are, we're talking about it now. It's great because I went and climbed that no longer there when acci erratic gray. Erratic. Oh, I'm on it driving. Thank you. Okay, so we've got the grant already coming up in about three images. So let's go to the next one, 10 42 and this is basically another key piece of evidence is strewn for thousands of square miles throughout the path of the flood. You have these gigantic boulders and these are being carried aboard iceberg. So let me, let me describe what we're looking at right now because this is a person. Is that you there? Uh, I took the picture. So it's two of my fellow travelers. Okay. Normal sized people and you know, whatever. Six feet tall and, and bounce them on top of each other. 1218. You're looking at probably the least 35 40 feet tall, right? Yeah, yeah. And Yeah, and wider. Wider than it is tall. Oh yeah. It's 60 feet wide. Does, that's insane. And that was carried by water. It was carried. It was carried on icebergs in the water. Oh my God.

Speaker 4:          03:27:06       This flood is not just water. It's, it's, it's, it's huge. Thousands of icebergs. It's far strips up by their moods. It's a jumbling mass of powerful erosive flow. Amazing.

Speaker 5:          03:27:16       Thousands of megafauna are done down. In fact, a lot of the, there've been a lot of a mammoth remains found in missoula flood sediments, particularly in the Willamette valley. Okay. Let's go to the next image. There we go. This is, I like out in the middle of the prayer. You again, you've got thousands of these things. I'll tell you what. I'm a chicken. I wouldn't stand right there. I think that thing's gonna roll on top of you. That would be a wrap son. Yeah. This is known as yeager raw. That thing's huge and is that you want to need there? No, that's one of my tribe. I took the picture and tell them. Stand there. Yeah. I said stand here and then I had the other guys go around the back rock push on it. This thing has kind of hanging off the side of that hill the way some of those Hollywood hills houses are the ones that are on stilts that that rounded massive stuff that it's sitting in.

Speaker 5:          03:28:06       It's called the Berg mound, and you see these icebergs are not clean ice, they're dirty, they're filled with gravel and debris. So when a Berg Berg, it's being carried into flood and the flood waters subside, the burgs get stranded in the land, they then melt. And if there's no boulder, there's just a mound. If there's no gigantic boulder, there's just a mound. But if there is a gigantic boulder being carried aboard the iceberg, it will be sitting in a Burg mound like you see. Right. That's amazing. So that white line that we see, it was where the iceberg was when it deposited that thing, then it just melted from there. No, that's actually a bedding plane between two different kinds of basalt. Oh, okay. So the mound itself below it is what you're saying is the Berg mound, that's the Berg mound and the bolder, the big boulder was the cargo sitting on top of the iceberg. Ah, okay. So the [inaudible] is not just water, it's water with a bunch of dirt and all kinds of other shit in it as well. And so when it melts, that's what it leaves behind. But at least I see. That's amazing. Okay. In the next image we have the hancock around. Is that you up there? Well that's me on top of that.

Speaker 5:          03:29:16       Once you're breaking the law.

Speaker 2:          03:29:18       Yeah, I was. I, I do that from time to time, but it, but it, it's, it, it's an amazing experience to stand there and to think what transported this? Well, we know it was transported in an iceberg and it was dumped there on the side of that valley. And it's just the thought of thousands of these things plowing along at 60 or 70 miles an hour, carried on a gigantic flood. How do we have anything left? You know, no wonder. No wonder we forgotten our past.

Speaker 5:          03:29:43       And here's the thing. I mean, what we're doing here is we're looking where these flood events are preserved the most spectacularly in. The reason is is because you had a very steep gradient from the ice sheet elevation to the Pacific Ocean. But like Graham and I, when we traveled across, we traveled across the continental divide and traveled from the rocky mountains to the twin cities, which is on the Mississippi River and all the way across, we were caught crossing huge meltwater Cooley's. We crossed the Missouri River valley, which is an under fifth stream, just very similar to the snake where the modern Missouri is just a little ribbon of river occupying this massive meltwater channel of which there are hundreds across the plains. And then when we got to Minneapolis, we went up and we visited some of the largest

Speaker 2:          03:30:30       amazing potholes, which again, you're looking on the scale of giants. This is, this is beyond imagination. What you look at and the, and the only the flood

Speaker 5:          03:30:40       explanation makes sense of it. Go to go to one zero five four Jamie, and you'll see, oh, there we go. I'm down inside the pot hole. One of the potholes looking up at Graham. So that's a pothole carved into stone by whirlpool. Yeah. Picking up rocks and amend that. Rob said, the erosive agent that's cutting out the pothole, just think like a massive hydraulic drill. Wow. Just picking up, you know, course rock and just drilling. Literally drilling holds 50 60 80 feet deep. Again, for the Rock, go to the Youtube, please. If you're listening to this, just go. Just so you got to fast forward to this. This is insane. Image is insane. Just thinking of watching rock spin around, drilling into the ground, and you're talking about over a short period of time. Yeah, probably. You know, I'm guessing you know these giant meltwater floods.

Speaker 5:          03:31:36       This is right along the Saint Croix River, which forms the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin. It was probably of several weeks duration to its peak at its peak, and so the drilling of the bedrock probably was accomplished within that time span. What I wouldn't give to know what that was like just to see it, but you would've had to be in an orbit to survive it, right? Yeah. Even if you're flying over in a plane pr probably that just the atmosphere change. Liz on top of these flood sediments from, I've documented it from Ohio to Washington state. There are thick layers of loss. Now euless is this strange topsoil that came down and it's, they've been arguing for generations. Is it wind deposited or water deposited? But the curious thing is it seems to be both wind and water deposited, but then I think the obvious explanation for it is, is that when you see the, the like the, the top layers of the flood sediments, particularly in the back flood regions where the, where the water was calm or rather than so torrential, you'll see these layers, these beautiful, it's because they're called writhe mites.

Speaker 5:          03:32:47       They're very rhythmical. On top of that is a layer of this lust topsoil with this vertical structure. Right. Well, the to me, and again without getting into the technical background, I think the logical explanation and most likely explanation is that at the tail end of the, the final flood flows, what you're seeing is, is rainfall of mud. And this rainfall of mud came down in a, in a fiction, many ancient traditions speak of black but humanist rain, mud falling from the sky, darkness, a time of darkness. It's all described in the myth. Myths are the memory banks of, of humanity. We should not call the myths, we should call them memories. Yeah, exactly. And, and again, this, this muddy rainfall perfectly fits the whole narrative. And yet with the mythology, it, it's, it's right there. When we think of these, the, the idea of these tsunamis, we think of water that you can see more, most likely dealing with the entire air around you, filled with torrential downpour and solid matter and everything's flying to the air. Incredible wins. Incredible wins. Yes. So it's both wind and water and just full on chaos, super hurricanes. It's nature gone chaotic and crazy on ultimate steroids. This is what it is. Wild. And it's real. That's the thing that didn't happening while people were alive. Oh yeah. It happened a while. People were alive.

Speaker 4:          03:34:11       Absolutely. Some dinosaur thing. No, it happened to blink of an eye ago. It happened. It happened when anatomically modern humans had already been around for 200,000 years. Writing. Well, no, but the, the not according to the orthodox historians, but if we're dealing with a lost civilization, which I believe to be the case, then yes, it's totally, it totally makes sense. Completely. Totally makes sense. Yeah. And it's time. It's time to get to grips with this. It's time to move, move forward to the next level and start recovering our memory, yelling and also start recognizing that this is a, this is a potential reality. This is not just the past. This is also very possible. Yeah. And, and, and again, if I may say so crowdfunding, it's the opportunity for the people to give their voice show. Can you show that page? This is the, the crowdfunding page for the comment research group.

Speaker 4:          03:35:01       Um, and it's on in the lake is on Graham Hancock. So if you've got to Graham hancock.com and click on the comment research group banner, uh, then you'll, you'll get taken immediately to the crowdfunding page. Please, please support it. Whatever you can give, it'll make all the difference. It sends a message that we, that we care about alternative, heretical research and also what you're at my website. I put up there a lot of other followups to this podcast. If people want to go places, I'm talking in America in the next weeks and links and connections. A lot of stuff related to this podcast is on my site. I'd like to plug my ideas that has a lot of these images on it. Okay. It's about five hours of stuff. Blu Ray and if they go to the website, sacred geometry international, do you have that available as a download? It's going to be if it's not already. I think it is available for a download. My laptop doesn't even, I don't know. Nobody's does anymore. The answer is yes. Okay. It's not now. It will be. I think it is actually now available for that and get it on itunes or Amazon or something, hours of stuff. But I get into a lot of other stuff,

Speaker 5:          03:36:09       some of the interesting sidelines, the Rko astronomy and the sacred geometry and so forth that might be associated with ancient cultures. And what's the name of this again? I'm a cosmic patterns and cycles of Catastrophe. Beautiful. And is there it is, yeah. That's the older version. This is the newer upgraded version. All right. Yeah, there we go. There we go. Beautiful. And there's the Blue Ray. Yeah, there's the Blueray. Yup. Okay. An HD download.

Speaker 1:          03:36:36       Excellent Barrios. Yeah. Gentlemen, this has been a long, long podcast of awesomeness. Hey man, this a cemented in my head. I may not the, the idea was already cemented in my head, but these images along with your compelling narrative is cemented even further. It was amazing. Such a cool podcast and a magic to entertain and scare the shit out of me at the same time. So thank you for that Graham. Um, it's a, you Graham underscore hancock on twitter. Yeah. Grab double underscore hank called, but I will underscore, yeah they did. They made it really difficult to reach me on twitter but it is there. And then you know I've got my facebook page and my website is the main portal, Graham hancock.com everything comes off there, my book, my events and, and all kinds of, you're verified on twitter so they know which one to follow.

Speaker 1:          03:37:22       No, I'm verified on facebook but they haven't verified me on twitter. I'm on or you know, I got 100,000 followers there but they haven't yet.
