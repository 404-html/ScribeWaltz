Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello, freak bitches. My mom was a wonderful man. I just spent. Oh, you know, she's getting old and stuff and I, I, I took her to see Dolly Parton and Tampa and a Dolly Parton have seen three times in two months. Man, she smells like she smells like cotton candy and baby powder and a high note here, let me try to hit you. Always hit me to cool shit. Dolly Parton is 70 years old. She did a three hour fucking show. She didn't sit in one place. You moved all over the stage. He played piano, Guitar, Banjo, flute, and then at one point she blew a saxophone. Now she didn't just a saxophone, like I had a few notes. She played Yakety Sax, which is like grand an, an, an, an, an, an, an in it that requires some fucking lung power. She's 70 years old. I took my 70 year old mother to see her and like mom's got a cane and we had to get a people mover and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Like she's, it's crazy man. So like I took mom to go see Dolly. Pardon my mother. You know, God love her, she's amazing. One of my favorite people in the world, but you know, she's like tiger, you finally made it and I was like, why? And she's like, because like we got to meet Dolly Parton, I was like, mom, you could have met Dolly. Pardon? Any old title and that's not a sign of prosperity or success or something like that. Like that happened back on clerks or something. But those days when Dolly Parton was on TV, there was only like three channels. Yeah. She fills arenas like it's crazy. It's a massive. And just watching somebody like, you know, I saw, I saw when I went up to Vancouver to shoot an episode of the Flash, I went and I was like, Holy Shit. Then there's a part of me, of course, I'm not a big country guy, but my old man loved country and Western even though we came from New Jersey and we weren't even from like Southern Jersey.

Speaker 1:          01:45          We're from Central Jersey. He loved country, West country and western. I hated it growing up. And he's now dead for like 12, 13 years. And naturally the older one gets, you hear that music, it takes you not to the president, but right back to your childhood. So lately, even though I've never been a country person, I find more country leaking into my life and it has everything to do with my father or something like that. So I went to see the show and it was like I might as well taking my dad with me. He's been dead so long. But like that was his dream show. Like he loved Dolly parties, big country music fan generally love Dolly Parton. So I went to see the show the first time because I was like, I got nothing to do, let's go. And then I was blown away by her showmanship, a storyteller as well.

Speaker 1:          02:22          She doesn't just sit there and play the music between songs. She'll sit there and tell you a story about growing up in the rocky mountains. She's fucking funny dude. I know she's got like patterns she's probably been doing for years, but she talks about. She's like, when I was a little girl, like we went into town and they grew up fucking poor and she's one of 13 children or something like that and she's like, I saw this woman, beautiful woman, and she's painted like an angel and she had pretty clothes and real big, pretty hair burn heels and a lot of makeup. And I said, Mama, who's that? And her mom is like, that's the town Trav, that girl is nothing but trash. And she goes, I said, that's what I want to be when I grow up. So that's why, that's why she's got the look.

Speaker 1:          03:01          She's got it. She's like, it cost a lot of money to look this cheap. So she's hilarious. It's a true like even if you're not like a Dolly Parton Fan, like what a true night of entertainment like, and you just want to appreciate. I saw her like last weekend I took mom to see her in Tampa. And so once innovate time I saw at the Hollywood bowl and then uh, like a month ago. And then I took mom to see her in Tampa and that was more like, Hey, dad would love this, you know, but she had this weird moment where she met Dolly in like, you're talking about two, seven year old women. And my mom went in for a fucking kiss. Not like, like, I want a friendship, but just like the way you would kiss a friend. But, and then you could see Dolly who's like had to politically maneuver strangers for 50 years or so.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Figure out, do I say, Hey, I don't kiss strangers or do I just have her lips were going for the lips of what she was going for. It was awkward dude. There was a moment where they were the exparel. And then finally they hugged and uh, you know, she was like, my husband loved your music and shit. It's really fucking beautiful the see. But mom, I love mom to death. But mom is like such A. Everybody's mother is very singular individual. But mom had this thing I was trying to figure out. I was like, when did this person die? I think we were talking about Barbara. I was like, when did aunt Barbara di and my mom's like, oh, hold on, and she had this thing when we were kids, like she get a calendar from church and she wouldn't write on it your birthday or a relative's birthday.

Speaker 1:          04:25          She'd write the day that they died. So like this day was the day uncle Andy die this day and Connie died. So my mom keeps all that information. So she goes, hold on. She comes out with a box of like funeral mass cards. Like when somebody dies, you go to a funeral, there's a little trading card that has picture of St John. The bag has a person's name and when they were born, when they were dead, my mom has like a collection, the way you would collect baseball cards and shit and we spread them all out on the table is 12 significant deaths in our family. She had lots more, but the ones that would matter to both me and her in our immediate zone, a family and between 12 deaths I was able to quiz my mother like who died in 1980 and she was like, oh, that was grandpa Smith.

Speaker 1:          05:06          Like she is my mom's obsessed with death but not in a like death is metal. When she was a child in Catholic school, they tried to explain hell her, you know, as you do in Catholic school, and she was fucking far too young to get the idea. So death has been her obsession her whole life. Staving it off, stopping it from taking not just her but her family, you know, she lost her husband to it. We all. Death is just a natural part of the process. My mom finds it like she's terrified, but now I as a, as a creative person, and I wonder if you feel the same way and I fancy myself a creative person. Some people like you, not very creative, but I fancy myself a creative person. No caveats. Death to me is not scary as much as like a repugnant idea where you're like, what?

Speaker 1:          05:51          Stop all this. Like I'm just getting the hang of it. I'm just learning like I got so many more jokes to tell and Shit like that. Like death to people who make stuff like us and that's why you might be the exception because you deal with death on a regular basis. Like with hunting and shit like that. Like it's just something that probably enters your purview farm with a month, but it is like one of those things, man, were you like wow, I hadn't really thought about that too often, but she's thinks about. Often when I think of death I'm irritated by it because I'm like, it's unfair. Like why? Like. But I imagine if I was by my grandmother, my grandmother lost her sight 12, 14 years before she died and I loved hanging out with her. I just play cards with her and shit like that.

Speaker 1:          06:34          And then when she lost her sight, she did. She was no longer interested in living. So she would sit around and be like, how are you gram? You go visit her, she'd be sitting in the dark and shit, listen to the radio, maybe no longer crocheting like she used to. We used to play cards, can do any of that shit. So she just sat there and he'd be like, how are you? And she'd be like, well I asked him to take me and he said he didn't answer, still not today. And I was like, Ooh Graham. She's like Jesus every day I pray that he finally take me and I'm still here. And she grew slowly, grew to be bitter about life and shit. Now, from where I sit right now, I'm the guy that's like, I never want this party to an oh shit. But I guess there could be a time in my life where you know, everyone you know and love is past and you just get to a place where you're like, you know what? I'm okay. I'm okay. Like who was it a, the singer that that just passed a law was the guy that sang Hallelujah. Leonard Cohen, Leonard Cohen didn't interview like before he passed like five months, five weeks, maybe 40 past where he was like, yeah, I'm ready for death. He's pretty much done everything I wanted to do and I'm, I'm ready for it, and he went fairly short there. Shortly thereafter. Grandma didn't Ms. Young on for a while but wanted to die. I hope I'm never that person.
