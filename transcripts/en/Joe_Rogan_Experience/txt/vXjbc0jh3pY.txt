Speaker 1:          00:00:00       That what's her brother, welcome back here. I'm back. You're one of the few college professors that I was a sense of humor about yourself like that. Well, you can, you can joke around about that. Exactly. It's, it's, um, I was talking to you before the show started about this recent article in the Atlantic and as soon as I saw it I was like, oh, this is just right up your alley and is, it's the coddling of the American mind. And this article is all about one of the things that you have been talking about a lot lately and um, uh, it's been on a lot of people's minds that work in academia because it's, it's, it's very confusing and it's very frustrating. But there is severe limitations on the words that you can use and the thoughts even that you can have in this article is all about trigger warnings.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       And uh, and in one case, here's, here's, and there were professors, listen to this law. Students were asking fellow professors at Harvard not to teach rape law. And in one case, even use the word violate, as in that violates the law. Less it caused distress. This is the article is called the coddling of the American mind. It's in the newest version of the Atlantic Dot Com. It's just a couple of days old. Um, and it is, it's fucking crazy what's going on with kids today. And this, this article gets into it and one of them was about something that, um, uh, there was a professor for protecting himself with a pseudonym and he wrote an essay for vox called I'm a liberal professor in my liberal students, terrify me, right? What the fuck is going on? Like what is going on where people are getting in trouble for words like violate.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       Well, by the way, one of the authors of that article is a good friend of mine who is director of fire. I can't remember the name of the accurate, what the acronym stands for, but he basically goes around, his organization, goes around trying to protect freedom of speech first amendment at campuses, precisely because of the unbelievable chilling effect of these types of lunacy movements. It's very strange. And you know what else is strange? It seems like you're not allowed to be conservative in a university and what, and by conservative I don't mean restrictive of other people's liberties like anti gay rights or anti choice or anti. I'm talking about fiscally conservative. I'm talking about being a person who has the ideas that some in the Republican Party, a spouse, you're not allowed to. So I'm not sure if we discussed this before, but even if we did, it's worth repeating. I talked about an article, an article that was done by some colleagues of mine. I don't know them well, but some, some academics

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       where they looked at the political affiliation of professors at top. I think it was California and schools, uh, whether they identified it or whether they actually had democratic affiliation or Republican. And as you might imagine, it was extraordinarily skewed towards Democrats. But then depending on the field of study. So for example, in sociology and in the humanities and in women's studies, women with a y, by the way, please don't write women with an e. That would be sexist at even, as I just said, the women oftentimes and women's studies, they, they think that to have men as part of the word women is itself a form of aggression. So they've altered the spelling to weight men. Oh no, that's not real. So you see, I know your audience already has the price of admission covered. Would that story, but it's still the word women, right?

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       So anyway, so the same word. Why? Why do you have to change the letters? So in sociology, do you train, change the word trigger because it sounds like the n word or a serious. You're getting triggered. I'm triggered, triggered. Well, I'm fucking triggered. If I was black, I'd be super triggered. Well, I don't know if you noticed some of my tweets. Now whenever I tweet anything, I put a trigger warning trigger warning. It's not become part of the vernacular to make it sit there article. It's too close to the n word. Way Too close. I'm triggered. But anyways, to finish the point about the study, 44 to one ratio in sociology. So imagine if you are a student, take doing an Undergrad in sociology, right? It's not a very good thing to have. Almost all of the professors that you will ever come across be of one particular persuasion.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       Now some people will write to me and say, but what do you mean the Democrats have everything, right? They have truth on their side and the Republicans are a bunch of hacks. Now when it comes to evolution evolution, that's true, right? If, if, if on average republicans are more likely to deny evolution than that point is well taken, but when it comes to issues, is the death penalty, right or wrong? What's kind of fiscal policy should you have? What type of foreign policy should you have? This is not a one plus one, you know, scientific equation, so you should be exposed to multiple viewpoints, but of course you shouldn't be because you should only interact with people who are similar to you will that. That is a problem with a lot of people that go to college, graduate, get their phd, get their doctorate, and then start teaching and never enter the real world, right? They stay in this sort of insulated world of academia and then they espouse these same ideas. They promote these same idea that they promote the same way of thinking as if this is the real world because this is the only world they know true. You know, one of the things about comedians is a lot of them are really, really crazy and fucked up and they do a lot of drugs and they're just out of control and not and they kind of forget that other people aren't like that and sometimes I'll bring like

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       one of my regular friends around like the comedy store and around some of my Canadian friends that are fucking crazy and they'll go, Jesus Christ, these guys just talk about ridiculous shit that they did. Like it's no big deal. And I'm like, well, in their world it isn't a big deal in their world, this is the normal world and everyone else is civilian. That's how they look at it. That's how you know the quote unquote hardcore comedians look at it. I think in academia you have a similar sort of a situation where they really do believe in microaggressions. They think that microaggressions are real. There was a fucking. This is one of the parts of the article that was really hilarious. There was a. They were trying to raise awareness about microaggressions, but in doing so and raising awareness from microaggressions, they had to give examples of these micro aggressions which triggered people and it's an infinite loop of victimology.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       So this guy had to apologize. He apologized for triggering people with his micro aggression. Examples of them were like, aren't you all supposed to be good at math to Asians like that? That is a micro aggression. I mean, is it a microaggression to say good things? This is what confuses me because like if you said to a black guy, you guys all have big Dicks, right? Is that a microaggression? Because then that's saying that perpetuating racial stereotypes, right? It is, but isn't it a good stereotype? Like everybody wants a big tick, right? Right. Allegedly. Right. Well, here's another microaggression that I thought was hilarious. I'm colorblind. I don't see race. That's a microaggression. You should see race. Yes, you should see race. So Steven, Kobe, when he says he doesn't see race, he is engaging in microaggression. Microaggression, go American. The word American by the way, is an aggression. It's Americans that aggression. Yet, how's that? Well, because you're surfing all of the America is to imply that it's only the United States of America. Somebody saying that it's America. It's as if the rest of the countries don't exist. Wow. One of them is America is the land of opportunity that is a microaggression and a white. Is that one offensive sense or here's another microaggression. I believe the most qualified person should get the job. Oh, that's illegal. That's a meritocracy. That's bad.

Speaker 1:          00:08:30       How is that possible? How could it be bad for the most qualified person to get a job? Isn't that the whole idea of job applications? We have a sponsor for this podcast called Zip recruiter, and one of Ziprecruiter's thing is like if you want to fill it, if they're trying to fill out a job, it allows you to post to like 100 plus job sites with one click and the idea is to find the most qualified candidate, which in turn gets you the best person for the job, which is a microaggression. So ziprecruiter is a micro aggression company. God, how horrible. It's lunacy. I mean, you wonder if at some point there'll be some sort of auto correction of all this. I would hope so. Right? I think that that is what's going on with a lot of our culture. I think what a, what a lot of our culture is, is an auto correction for the ignorance and hypocrisy of like the sixties and seventies and the eighties.

Speaker 1:          00:09:27       And so we're going away the other way. Right? You know, with like, did you see Bernie Sanders speech get interrupted for black lives matter? Who doesn't think black lives matter? I mean, I want. I want someone who doesn't think black lives matter to speak because I. all I've heard is people who, who agree black lives matter. I mean everybody agrees. I don't, I don't know anybody who doesn't think that these shootings, police shootings are horrific, but to, to interrupt a guy who is easily the most liberal. That's what was going to say is that of all the candidates for president, a guy who is the most diverse, that guy will march with Martin Luther King know he marched in the civil rights movement. He's been a civil rights advocate since the 19 sixties and they interrupt his presidential speeches. You don't have a theory that a lot of these, a lot of these folks, you know, the Chegg, Aveiro wearing tee shirt wearing guys, they want to feel part of a greater cause.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       Yes. So even though many of those battles have passed them by, they had been won civil rights. I mean, of course there's still racism, but in terms of institutionalized racism, we certainly are much better than we were 50 years ago. But yet, you know, they're young kids, they revolutionary. They're wearing Che Guevara. You know, Viva La Revolution and they have to engage in this kind of behavior. Thirty years from now, they'll watch that youtube clip and they'll think they're a bunch of buffoons. I think that's a very valid possibility. I think another possibility is that when you look at people and they, they, they're, they're trying to find like causes to support. I think there's a lot of people out there that are just fucking assholes. Right? And what they're doing is trying to find something that allows them to get out that asshole of aggression and be justified. Right? You know, something that allows them to be righteous, like black lives matter.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       You fucking pizza. And there's screaming at someone who believes black lives matter, uh, screaming. Someone was not even remotely racist, but they will. They will yell it in your face the way they did at this Bernie Sanders thing in order to just get their rocks off. Whatever personal frustrations, whatever psychological failures that they have got bouncing around inside their head, whatever closed loop thinking they have, they're using these valid points and these things that a lot of people think about as a sounding board, which is why they're the ones who are interrupting. It's not that this, this demands attention at this moment in order to solve a problem because there's a fucking fire. We have to put this fire out right now where people are going to die. No, this has nothing to do with that. It gives them the opportunity to grand stand, to take a moral high ground and his scream out and beg for attention and to be good because nobody can.

Speaker 1:          00:12:18       You can't say it like racism fucking sucks. Nobody can say, hey, it's not that bad. You know, he can't say that. So you can. You could be like super aggressive and really shitty and confrontational and insulting about a cause you believe in and that is one of the problems that I have with this whole social justice warrior movement because I find a lot of these people that are involved in it to be asshole human beings and even though I, I agree with a lot of what they support, I think they suck and when I go to their twitter pages and I look at what their interactions are, all their interactions are insulting people and getting angry at people and, and, and it's all negative and I see if I can please interject. I think they don't have an ability to accept that people might have differing opinions.

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       Right. You and I can debate many issues and yet we can leave here both being respectful of one another and so I think that this course is. I'm right. If you think otherwise you must be an asshole and I will shut you down. And so they really don't have this capacity, this critical capacity to engage in reasoned dialogue. I saw it. I mean, I'm lucky in that I don't really get many of these, uh, social justice warrior trolls. I mean 99 percent of the people that interact with me are very nice and very sweet, but that small one to five percent group that, as you mentioned, are real assholes. It's almost impenetrable to try to speak to them. Right? I mean, I engage them in a very dispassionate manner, you know, hopefully providing them with facts, trying to be polite, but I am an asshole simply for disagreeing with them.

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       So most of the people that I've blocked the aren't that many, but the ones that I've, that I've blocked, it's because I try to engage them and the only way they could engage in return is to insult. And so it's a real, it's a, it's a real breakdown of civil discourse. And also insult when it's just a matter of opinion about things that are debatable. Exactly. Here's one that, you know, the story about Occidental University or Occidental College College College Occidental College, where there was two students that got drunk and they're a boy and a girl. They texted each other and the boy and the girl had sex and the boy got accused of rape and kicked out of the school and where the girls stayed and I was like, well, that's crazy. Like first of all, you're, you're, you're changing the rules of human behavior because people have been getting drunk and having sex since the beginning of time and so to call it rape now, after all these years, just on a whim, especially when two people are consenting adults, they're consenting adults.

Speaker 1:          00:14:56       They can go to war and when they can't really vote yet or 18, right? You voted 18. Yeah, you can't drink. They can't drink it, but they're kind of Montreal, Canada, Montreal and you're crazy country. But the idea that the boy is responsible and the girls not to me seems ridiculous and it seems contradictory to the whole idea of feminism in the first place is that we're equal now. If we are equal, why are we not equal in terms of our ability to take responsibility for being under the influence? I mean if your. If you are responsible for being under the influence when you're driving. If you're responsible for being under the influence, if you commit violence, why you're not responsible for being under the influence when you have sex. If you're a girl, that's crazy. Well, when I said this, Oh my God, the amount of people that called me a massage and vanilla rape enabler and enablists and ableist piece of shit like they just.

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       But it was all insulting. It's like how can it be insulting when this is a debatable point? Was this co? This is a clearly rational, debatable point. You talking about two human beings that are adults that got drunk, but the male is the rapist like that. That's ridiculous. There are now, I don't know the exact details, but they are now on some university campuses. You actually have a consent form where you sort of go through the iterative steps as you're starting to engage in sex. So we are now in the foreplay stage. Do you hear by consent? And we pulled some like, uh, I think putting on Barry White music might be a bit more mood inducing than signing a. it's a legal document, white music as rape enabling. Because what you're doing is you're coercing you or making the women aroused, hence they don't have all their faculties for Barry White is a genocidal rapist.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       Well, that's, that's the language that they're using is I was unable to consent, right. Which obviously there's, there's a scale, right? We can all agree that there is a level where people are at. You are breathing deeply into that mixer. So we had an issue with it the other day because it's better because, uh, yeah, we got to. My friend Barry Crimmins was here and he got a little hammered and he was breathing into the mic. I got like 100 stopped people from breathing to the mic. Tweets. What is this, Jamie? Is this real? Yeah, this is. Jake was drunk. Josie was. Oh, that's right. I've seen this. Jay Can Josie hooked up? Josie could not consent. The next day jake was charged with rape. There you go. What the fuck is that? That's a real poster. I, I tweeted that. I remember this. You know, for example, if a, if a high status male seduces a lower status woman, that itself could be construed as a form of rape precisely because his powers so intoxicating like a professor and a student perhaps, but in that sense, I mean you might have an ethical boundaries, right, but I mean forget, I mean just a guy who meets a girl at a bar and he happens to be a professor.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       The rich man and a woman, right? Some of the virtue of the difference in hierarchy, that itself could be construed as coercive because she wasn't able to control herself in the face of this overpowering man, not physically just because it was high status. Well, the reality of being a male is if an attractive woman comes onto a man, she's raping them because you're. You have no control. Like of a beautiful woman comes onto a guy like Jamie had a bar that poor kids fucked. Look at them. This is Jamie. Jamie looking them over there. He's fucked. If some traci lords in her prime looking chick comes up. Jamie, that's a reference from La. I met her. She still, she wasn't she a porn start at 15 because she fit easy, not breck in the party. Um, yeah. I believe she was lighter weight. Since we're on a porn references.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       Can I tell you maybe the greatest? I, yeah, I received a lot of comments on my stuff. Maybe the greatest one I've ever received. Somebody wrote, I hope I'm getting the exact quote in reference to me. He wrote, this guy is the Ron Jeremy of evolutionary psychology. I said, that's it. I, I could drop the mic and just, you know, retire well that means you're disgusting but effective fat and sweaty and Harry, that's what you're saying. Well, the whole thing about Ron Jeremy was ron. Jeremy existed in an era where the guys were supposed to be gross because people watching porn. We're all guys. So you wanted like a guy who is disgusting to be getting late. So you like, I got a chance this could happen. Look how hot she hasn't. She fucks Ron. Jeremy. Oh yeah. Um, nowadays the men are equally unattainable as well.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       And the idea is that the women watch it with men, right? Allegedly, I don't know anything about that. No, I'm sure porns raping their culture. Anyway, that was contacted once a by a former porn star who had already uh, you know, he had, he had the hat, had the NBA, I think an Mba, and he wanted to pursue his phd with me. He actually came up to Montreal, spend a few days with me, visited my lab and then ended up, uh, not, not going on for a phd, but uh, so that's my, uh, the closest I've come to a porn star, a guy who almost became a doctoral student. That's interesting. Well, I can't even say his name. I think a man who does that has a bit more freedom to move around over a woman does that. She's sort of labeled by our culture and some sort of a weird way.

Speaker 1:          00:20:17       Maybe less so in Canada. So in Canada I think in terms of as, or a little bit more loose sexually. Well you're, you've been to Montreal, you were there recently, you see that, I mean every second to store stores. A strip bar. Yeah. You guys have a lot of strip bars up there, but it's also just the way people talk and act about sex. It just seems, doesn't seem shameful, less puritanical. We're, we're so fucking boys in Quebec is even more so what you're saying because it. Exactly. So it's good that European vibe. So, so in the, in the context of Canada, you know, some of the Anglo Saxon provinces historically might be closer to Americans. Munter, Kobeck. It's a free for all. Yeah, cut back is crazy. So like the, the more um, conservative spots are where there's very few people and everyone's scared and you believe in Jesus more. Don't go to Saskatchewan if you want to get lucky. Oh really? Joking. Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan right now they're fucking warming up their fingers for hate mail.

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       But um, that's how it is in America too. It's like the spots that are like, really, there's not a lot of people there in the middle of nowhere. There's fucking church everywhere in those spots. Yeah. I found that in a Latin America or Central America. I was in Costa Rica recently, and the poorer the neighborhood, the prevalence of churches was like through the roof. It was crazy. We were driving to the cloud for us and as we're driving up there, you pass her all these really small rural communities and you see a lot of churches. Yeah. Yeah. When people, I guess they need hope in those spots that are kind of solves the biggest potential mortality, by the way. Speaking of mortality, let me do the segue. It is your birthday officially. The Godfather is hereby wishing you a happy birthday. I thought, what can I bless? What can I get Joe as a gift, by the way, I owe you a copy of my.

Speaker 1:          00:22:08       One of my books signed. Forgive me. I didn't send it, but this guy has got fame. He's got the looks. She's got charisma. He's got money. Keep going on and get them. Anything good except I couldn't get him. You just 11. Yeah. I don't want anything people keep giving. Jamie gave me seven. Cool though. But, you know, I think that um, the uh, existential angst of a, of death being solved by religion for a lot of people is like a nice little scaffolding to just sorta like carry your way through life. You know, people have gotten angry at me for suggesting that I'm not suggesting it for you or for anybody. I'm not. I mean, I'm not suggesting there's a lot of things that people do that I wouldn't want to do that they do to kind of get by in this life or it's takes Xanax or uh, you know, or drink every night after work in order to keep from kicking their dog.

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       I mean, I don't know what the fuck is going on in your head, but for a lot of people in these bad rural type situations, it seems to be like, it seems to be a common theme. Right? And if you really look at everything as being natural, which is I what I try to do, you know, that term nature, everybody wants to look at that as like wild life outside of cities. I kind of look at everything as nature and I look at human behavior patterns and how much they repeat themselves as being pretty natural and these weird little spots where there's not a lot of people, it seems to attract a lot of churches. You know, I, I wrote an article on that point that I think maybe a year or two ago looking, it was somebody else's research that I was summarizing, looking at the content

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       of prayers. So what is it that people pray about money as an example, but as a function of their income status, socioeconomic status, and as you might predict, uh, the content of what I pray to God about drastically changes as a function of where I fit in that hierarchy. What do people that are really rich pray about? Maybe health must be right? Yeah. Health and family and stuff like that. Yeah. Uh, it's, um, it's one of those things where I, I reluctantly, I'm not just accepted but I can almost supported because you mean religiosity. Yeah. For people that are in bad places and bad situations, I see that it helps. Well, so chapter eight of one of my books is I titled it very provocatively perhaps marketing hope by selling lies, right? And I give different examples of hope peddlers, a medical quacks, a self help gurus, and of course I argued that the greatest peddler of hope is of course religion.

Speaker 2:          00:24:50       Uh, and so you're exactly right. It's a, I think it takes almost a maladaptive honesty to not believe because it is so much more comforting to believe. And also the people that decide not to believe. It's almost like they have to try so hard in those areas to not believe that they become angry about it. They can become angry about their disbelief. Right. You know, I'm a nonbeliever, but I'm not angry. I'm very gentle. You will. You're very intelligent man. Well, you recognize these patterns and not succumb, but for a lot of folks, for a lot of folks also, you're dealing with so many people in your community. There are also a part of that. And then the church becomes like a sort of a community center by proxy. What David Sloan Wilson, who's a evolutionary biologist, a good friend of mine, very famous biologist, he looks at the evolutionary roots of religion and he actually argues a great book I'm doing is plugging for him now that I think he wrote in 2002 Darwin's Cathedral where he actually demonstrated or argued that groups that are religious actually out survive.

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       Those that are not using an argument of commonality, right? Groups that are religious are more cohesive. Band together are more communal, therefore they should be able to survive other groups. Now, his, his theories are a bit contentious because many evolutionary psychologists and evolutionary biologists reject the idea that evolution can happen at the group level. They argue that evolution should happen at the individual, at the gene level, and this is a fight that he's been having for many years now, but that's one example where you could actually study religion not only from a scientific perspective, but from an evolutionary perspective. I have a friend who lives in a married male and female are married in a sort of a rural area and a long time ago I was having this conversation with them, um, where the, the wife was

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       just sort of explaining how if it wasn't for religion, her and the husband wouldn't be together and the way she was saying it was counseling, her husband was dumb and like he needs something to keep him like on this good path and pattern. And they'd been married for like at the time, I think like 15 or 20 years. And she was like, do you think that we would have still been together if it wasn't for our belief in God and Lord and whether or not an edge goes whether or not it's real. Wow. And I was like, Whoa, this is some heavy shit. It's almost like she's given her husband some sort of placebo to like, keep this guy from drinking and fucking getting on a train like a Hobo or whatever the hell she do. You know, like God kinda kept them together and kept the family together.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       But she was looking at it in a very pragmatic way and I was like, wow, this is deep, you know, the Middle East. And I've seen it in my own family. There was this incredible fatalism that comes with religiosity. So I have a family member of. I won't mention who it is, who's was Ariel Helwani not are you highlighted by the way? Shout out to my nephew and to all the twitters, twitter is out there. He really is my nephew. He's my sister's, uh, son. Uh, but anyways, so this male member, uh, not rel a shout out to Ariel, he, he views everybody. He was everything through the lens of it's God's will. So if he opens up a store and the store doesn't do well, well it's not that he might have made some bad poor business decisions. It must be God's will had God wanted it to be differently than things would have turned out differently.

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       And, and that type of fatalism is actually quite a depressing and that it doesn't allow for a feedback loop. Right? I mean, you don't get feedback from the environment that says change course of action. If everything that happens happens because it's God's will, then you really just an empty vessel that's just executing God's will and so, uh, and you see that a lot in the Middle East. If God wants and child life, God, this, if God, that if it meant if it was meant to be, it's really part of the loss of the Arabic language, the practice and feedback loops are what it's all about. I mean, that's what life is when you're opening a business or doing a sport or you know, whatever the fuck it is. Practiced resume reviewing data feedback loop making possible corrections, objectivity. Yeah. All those things are what makes people improve. And matter of fact, I read an article recently about music. Were there, were there were discussing music that the inherent qualities of someone's music or really just a lot of what makes a great musician his practice and feedback loops right there. I mean that's really what it is. Not God's will but, but if you believe that, you know, it's limiting and empowering at the same time. Exactly. Because if you also are involved in this practice feedback, but you really think God's

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       on your side because you play a mother fucking mean acts, there's actually a psychological trait that maps onto what we're talking about. This. It's a locus of control. Are you familiar with this term? Do you know what? No, I'm not. So locus of control is basically ideas. Some of us are internally driven in terms of our locus of control, meaning that we attribute things that happened to us, to us, I did well on the exam because I studied hard because I'm intelligent. Okay. Versus external locus of control as you attributed to environmental factors. I did poorly on the exam, not because I didn't study, but because the professor is an asshole. He's an Indian. Right? And so people who score high on external locus of control, then you can predict certain other behaviors, for example, they're much more likely to be gamblers. Right? Precisely because it's fatalism, right?

Speaker 2:          00:30:30       I mean, my turn will come. It's written in the skies, uh, the black. It should be up soon, right? If you're internally locus of control, then you know that all that stuff is random and they're red and black or just they come and go depending on how that ball drops. Exactly. Yeah. That's a lot of people do really firmly believe in that. Yeah, and it's sort of there. That's how they get through this life and it's very much a blinder. It puts them in a very narrow channel. It's very difficult to escape. Once you have that firm belief, you know of have that. These patterns are sort of clearly established. It's going to be my time. My time is coming. Well my time. Going back to the gambling casinos, actually our operators are very spot. They play on that cognitive illusion because what they do is they give you this card where you keep track of how many times it's come on read and how many times, how many times the number 13 has come as a complete illusion, right?

Speaker 2:          00:31:31       It's giving you a car. You could take a car so when you play relapse. Exactly. So if you go to the Montreal casino, you can get those cars. Oh look, 13 has come up 14 times, but I think 37 is up. Should be up soon. Right. What it's doing basically is it's giving you a sense of control over otherwise completely random events. Right? Each of those throws the ball are independent events. I mean, unless it's a rig machine, so the casino operators understand you and psychology and they play on it and then the idiot succumb to it. How rude.

Speaker 2:          00:32:08       That's uh, the, the, the. But what's crazy is when luck is on their side, it seems real like when you get a hot hand, like, I don't play craps, but I've seen people play craps and they get a hot hand. They start rolling dice, right? And they feel like they can lose and they'll go on a hot streak. They'll go on a hot streak with, with Black Jack as well. They get the right cards, poker and it feels like it's happening. But because that hot streak is itself a random pattern, I'll tell you a great, great story and I'll

Speaker 3:          00:32:39       actually mention who it is. I hope he won't be upset if I mentioned this. It's my father who is a avid six, 49 player. I Bet your dad doesn't listen to this shit. Probably not 6:49 basically is a. is a lottery game played in Quebec. You, you choose six numbers out of 49. Your chances of getting it are, as you know, infinite. There's really small and so one day he had called me at the office at my university office, said, hey son, I'm, I'm playing some, some, some cards. Give me six numbers and say, oh, that I have some students in my office, can I call you back because it just, just give me six numbers. So I said, all right, one, two, three, four, five, six. So then he goes, well, if you're not going to take the damn game seriously, why am I calling you right now?

Speaker 3:          00:33:18       Why did he do that? Because he actually was convinced that the numbers one, two, three, four, five, six, and I bet some of your listeners will, will also think that the numbers one through six are, is, is less likely of a combination to come up than any other combination of six numbers simply because it has the illusion of of looking ordered. Right? But it isn't. It is just one of the 14 million possible combinations that I think it's one out of $40 million. So again, these, these biases, these cognitive traps are so alluring and it's so easy for people to succumb to them. Is it single digit numbers can be doubled if it goes up to 49, 49 digits? No, no. Forty nine numbers. One to 49. You pick your six, 12, 18, 39, 42. And so I just picked one through six and he was absolutely convinced that that combination of six numbers is simply that you're a fool. I'm an idiot.

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       The lottery itself is such a trap. My grandmother used to only talk about the lottery. She talked about the lottery and dead people that were talking to her. My grandmother was like, she was crazy and she, uh, she firmly believed that she had some psychic ability, right. And uh, she's always like, I knew that number was going to come up. She would always tell you I was going to bet that she would talk about what number she was going to bet and I was going to bet nine that didn't put it in and you know, 19 through sick too, you, she rattle off whatever the fuck the number was. And this was back in the day in New Jersey where I'm the, they would play the numbers, which is like this local created sort of lottery that the mob ran. It was this weird thing and my grandmother was a part of it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       She would like help run the numbers. Nice. Yeah. She, uh, I don't know what her function was, but she was a part of it to the point where she got arrested and did six months in jail and they're running the numbers and she wouldn't, she wouldn't rat anybody out. So, uh, you know, my, my grandmother would like a knit, like little scarves and shit for the guards. And do all kinds of weird shit. I didn't find out about this until later when I was a kid. We just thought grandma was just fucking busy traveling or something. We had no idea where the hell she was. We'd go visit grandpa. Where's grandma? Couldn't find her. She was, oh, she's visiting your aunt Mary or she's a, you know, it was always like. But really she

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       was in the pokey. Right. Doing hard time for numbers. So speaking of kind of Kooky a family members, I have a paternal aunt and I've actually written about this general what tasks geography is. It's a fancy term for something that you might otherwise not. Does that term go. So Tasha Griffey is the reading of your fate since we're talking about these issues through a. In the Middle East, we do it with the tea leaves or that you could do with [inaudible] or you could do it with the residue. That's what you flip over the coffee mug. That right. So the residue that's left, that's what you read. So this lady would come over to our house and that was, you know, maybe a seven, eight, nine year old boy and I already knew that the Jig was up on this thing and she, when she would come over, it would be like the pope is visit thing, right?

Speaker 2:          00:36:24       And lower rise coming over to tell us about our future. So then she would start, she'd look at these, these, these random patterns and the things that you would say are, you know, I see happiness in your future. Well I could have a good bowel movement later and that's happiness. The Dallas cowboys could win. That's happiness. My wife and I can have sex tonight. Then that's happiness. So there was no way to falsify her profoundly general prediction, right? She, she, she never. She never looked at the, at the residue and said, you will be getting a 13 point seven percent increase in your income. Right? Specificity is the enemy of these fortune tellers. Right? So they give you these vague predictions which you could then fill into your life in any infinite number of possible ways. Yeah. We had this guy on the Scifi show that it did, his name is Bennett check and he's a master at what he calls, they call it mentalism or something like that and he's a mentalist.

Speaker 2:          00:37:20       And uh, he is one of those guys that will tell you absolutely straightforward. This is bullshit. I am, I am using tricks and I won't tell you what the tricks are, but I will tell you right now, I am not a psychic. This is not magic. Magic is not real. He actually gets angry at people that pretend that they could read, like you remember, there was a whole series of those shows that they've since pulled off the air, but where there was psychics and you know, they were like, there was like the long island medium, right? Remember that? And they were talking to people's dead relatives and all those are some that do with dead animals. It wasn't one of those things. There's one, it's. So there is a cross species psychic. Can you imagine your fucking dog doesn't say Jack Shit to you when he was alive, but when he's dead, he starts talking to psychics. That's right. Yeah, man, I didn't like the way you pet me, bro, at the back of my head like I'm an asshole. Right. Well, this, um, this idea that someone can actually read into your past and pull this information is so appealing to people that they mistake the way the person's questioning them and the clues and the little bits of information that they give and how this person is really just good

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       at forming puzzles based on pattern chunking. Exactly. They just know how to. They know they've done this so many times they know how to get it, but this guy, even though he told me what he was doing, we had some people in the audience. We had a small audience and we had him perform these tasks and these folks have them come up and he would ask them questions. It was amazing. I mean, he's just really, really. Despite the fact that you knew all the tricks, it was easy to sort of succumb to the illusion. Here's the thing though, I don't know the tricks. I just know they are tracked. She wouldn't tell us what the tricks were, but he said, like, I'm telling you, I am not a psychic by any stretch of the imagination. And he did a bunch of other cool stuff like you bent spoons and stuff like that with his mind.

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       Right? It's bullshit. He's like, it's all bullshit. I'm using trickery. He goes, but I won't tell you how I do it, but I'm not magic. Which would be really rude if he actually was magic and it's just like his, his shtick is calling out all these other people who were also actually magic. Imagine that it was like a sellout for all the real magic people. Right. My sister was in high school. She went to one of her friends, uh, hired a psychic and they all sat around and this psychic would like, slowly but surely read them. I was, I was very, always very skeptical of stuff like that. From the time I was little because I knew my grandmother was fucking crazy and she always claimed to be psychic, but listen to my sister come back. She would tell me all this stuff, you know, she knew all about this and she knew all about that and she knew about the time I did that and I'm like, didn't you know about all that stuff?

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       She's not telling you anything you don't already know. So she's telling you stuff you already know. Yeah. I'm telling you. It was amazing though. I was like, how is it amazing that she tells you shit that you already know what? That's not amazing yet. There's a study, I can't remember the exact reference, but you could take the astrological predictions, you know, the twelfth and you're giving it to people randomly and anyone that I give you, he'd be able to argue that perfectly fits you. Right? Of course. I see. Because it is so vague that you could infuse your life into any one of these sort of vague the script for this. So yeah. Yeah. They're ultra vague. Yeah. But those are stupid. Like, those today will be an amazing day for business. Like fuck, you know, you want to know specifics. Right. But I had a friend who ran into someone in Venice beach and uh, the guy was like, one of those save the rain forest type dudes.

Speaker 1:          00:40:57       He had like some little stands up and he said, if I guess your birthday will you listen to me? And my friend was like, go ahead. And he gets his birthday on the day and then he was, wow, the fuck did you do that? He goes, will you listen to my story now? But the rain forest. And he goes, do that to my friend. He brought his friend over and he gets his friend's birthday to. Yeah. To what? Let's say. I don't know, man. That's what I'm saying. I'm reserving judgment on that story too. Know it's a true story. My friend definitely didn't lie. He's because he's baffled by it. Here's where I told Penn Jillette obviously. Yeah, yeah. Musician, magician rather. And a good friend of mine. And so I said, how's this guy do that? He goes, there's, there's techniques you can do that. How do you deal with it?

Speaker 1:          00:41:39       Man Guys shows up and he says to you, you know, I can guess your birthday. He doesn't know you. You don't know him. How the fuck is that possible? And he told me there's techniques. I'm like, what the fuck, man? There's 365 days a year. How is that guy going to guess that William stumped and it's not even one in 365, right? The odds of you nailing it, it's probably higher than one and 365, right? Isn't that work? That are. There are interesting probabilities. What, for example, if you were to say how likely are to people in a room to have the same birthday, that number, and I don't remember what I've seen a lot longer than you think it is a lot higher than you think. Exactly right. A lot higher than you. And I remember when, when I took probability and stats, uh, you know, as a math on the ground, that's one and sort of the classic examples that you, your study precisely because it is so counterintuitive.

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       Yeah. There was a show where someone did that and they went into, it was like one of these conmen dudes went into like, he bet people and he went into a Oh, like a restaurant and he had like the day to find two people. Yeah, like certain amount of time to find two people that share the same birthday that worked there or that, uh, that we're in a customer's there and he nailed it in like an hour. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Cool. Just a bunch of people coming in and you get like a May twelfth or whatever the right. Yeah, but, but the idea that someone could just point at you godfather, I believe your bus stalling and Axon came out there. Gad Fad, fad, the um, you know, I don't know how anybody does that, but according to Penn Jillette, I got to listen to him though because he's a fucking magician and those guys were all tricksters.

Speaker 1:          00:43:25       They know how to do shit. Like one of the cool things about Penn and teller, if you ever go to wash them, is that they'll tell you it's bullshit while they're doing it. And you have no idea what the fuck they just did, how they did it. Incredible. Yeah. That's all really sneaky stuff is just managing illusions, right? I mean, that's what they're doing. Yeah. And that's what's really cool about the band check character was that he was like really adamant about that stuff and very angry about people steal money from folks by claiming to be mediums and talking to their relatives. And he's like, I just think that anyone who would try to give someone hope that perhaps their dead relative is talking from the grave and telling them important things they need to know. But meanwhile they're just making it up. It's just a foul, disgusting human being. I'm with you. My grandmother would have bought it, hook, line and sinker. She believed it, man. We had a dude a dye in my grandmother's house. There was a guy who, um, during, um, I think it was like the fifties or the sixties, you know, they were pretty poor and there was this guy in the neighborhood who needed a place to live

Speaker 3:          00:44:31       and he would pay them to rent a room in their house. Is Pretty common back in those days and you know, sometimes we'd eat dinner with them and what have you. And he died in his room one day and uh, they believe that this guy was talking to them. They believe this guy was in the house and that she would, uh, go up into the attic sometimes and he would be up there and she would see him and talk to them. Oh, freaked me the fuck out, man. It's very creepy. Did you ever hear, I'm not sure if I'm going to get her name right. I think it's Emily Rose. Others that name now, the youngest woman or girl to ever publish. It's kind of relate to some of this hocus pocus stuff that we're talking about. Youngest girl to ever publish a paper in Jama, Journal of the American Medical Association, a very prestigious journal.

Speaker 3:          00:45:16       I think she was maybe nine or 10 or 11. I discussed this in one of my books. Um, and basically as a great four or five a science project, she wanted to explore touch therapy. Gee, are you familiar with windows? So touch therapy is one of those quackery. But I'm triggered right now by you saying, right, right. Just triggered me. Right, right. Uh, so basically it's the touch healer has some sort of energy and in his or her hands that they can sort of levitate around your pain area, like Reiki, Reiki, whatever. Yeah. Right. And so she wanted to test whether those claims were true. So she set up a extraordinarily simple experiment to test their abilities. And so what basically she did is she would put out her hand and then they had to determine whether it's her right hand. In other words, there's, there's, there's a, there's a, uh, a barrier where they can't see which of her hands is out and they have the ability of touch.

Speaker 3:          00:46:22       They should be able to predict whether on the right or left, this is where her hand is. And of course they ended up doing worse than random. In other words, less than 50. I mean, you have one in two chance of just guessing randomly whether it's the right or left. Right? And she demonstrated that these touch healers, who supposedly are able to cure cancer by levitating their hand over areas are not even able to predict whether the hand that's out is on the right or left. Right. I mean, so imagine what an elegant experiment that is. And it was published in that journal now. What do you think those touch healers came back with as a rebuttal? Can you think of anything new other than that? No, they basically said that when you, when you set up these types of experiments in a laboratory that ends up wait for it affecting the energy fields. And therefore by testing our abilities, you are ultimately removing our abilities. Therefore it's an unfalsifiable position. It's not science. I have heard that expression.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       I've heard that thought of when people were talking about people who don't believe in psychics. Right? And that if you talk to a psychic but you don't believe in them, your negative energy, the fears with their gift. Exactly, exactly right. So how could you ever tested right? Can that. That's why. That's why all of these sort of quackery movements are part of the sort of non science epidemiology, right? Destiny, right? The idea of destiny. If I walk out of my house now and I get hit by a car, that was my destiny. If I go ahead, oh no, please go to. If I walk out of my house and I don't get hit by trucks, that was my destiny. So what state of the world would have to happen for it, for me to be able to test the destiny or not? This thing, I can't.

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       Anything that happens is my destiny, right? So it's unfalsifiable. You know, I have a, uh, a little piece of Hocus pocus that I, I don't, I don't necessarily believe, but I, uh, entertainment from time to time and that is synchronicity. Like when you're discussing an object and then something will come up, whether it's on television or the news that just perfectly fits into what you're talking about. And you're like, well, how God damned convenient is this. Like I was having a, um, a text, a conversation with a friend of mine this morning and he lives on the east coast and I live in the west coast. We're going back and forth and he's having health issues and he's going to talk to a doctor about probiotics and while we're having this conversation, I go downstairs and I'm about to work out. I turn on the television and good morning America is having a, an expert discuss probiotics and how gut health can affect all sorts of various things including your mood, all sorts of various illnesses.

Speaker 1:          00:49:19       And like literally at the same moment I'm having this text conversation with my friend. So I take a photo of the television and I sent, I sent it to him and like, how crazy is this? Like we're talking about this and Bam, it's on tv like that. Can I, they mystify that story. Why would you want to fuck it up for me? Man would do apologies. This is actually called the cell a bias. So for example, if you say, uh, you know, every time I get in the shower, the phone rings, right? Right. Habits me right now, what? What are the events that you're not coding in your brain, so the other times the phone rang, no locks on the phone can ring or cannot ring, and you could get into the shower or not get into the shower. So it's a two by two matrix.

Speaker 1:          00:50:02       The brain is only coding the instances, the cell a bias. One of the biopsies were the two events happened, the phone rings and I get in the shower. The three other events. Your brain never codes because they're not events. Therefore you end up overestimating the likelihood of that event. Oh my God. Every time the phone rings, I'm in the shower, so this is what's happening with that probiotic story, right? There's a million other times that you spoke him about something else and then you turned on the TV, but there wasn't to use your term synchronicity, but that one time where it happened, you code it as as something magical and mystical. No, you're not. You don't seem very buying your fucking bullshit or all men.

Speaker 1:          00:50:45       So you're sticking with your magical thinking. Say The universe is a all working together to sort of. That science stuff is overrated. I hear a lot of it's bullshit, Bro. Right here. A lot of it is guesswork. They don't know what to do. I just think that it was a beautiful coincidence, but that's how I look at it. And there's a series of these beautiful coincidences that happen all the time when you're tuned in the vibe of the universe, man. Wow, whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. I need to recover from that. A lot of people believe that. Right? Is that. So that's a big one, isn't it? The vibe of the universe at moving away from spiritual death or do you want to talk about some real science or do you want to join the uh, no and absolutely. Yeah. So man, I really believe that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:32       I think it's fun. I mean, for people listening, is he serious? No, we're, we're joking around. But um, it is weird when stuff like that happens and you do wonder why do you familiar? I'm sure you are with simulation theory. Tell me a bit about it to see what you mean. Simulation theory is the idea, and this is not just being bandied about by Comedians, but by actual physicist who contemplate the, when you extrapolate the nature of technology and where we're at now and what's possible today with Oculus rift and all these virtual reality programs that are developing that are extraordinarily effective. I mean, I haven't seen the newest version of oculus rift, but apparently it's in four. K is, are what? Immersive games, not games. Um, oculus rift, they, they're going to apply at the games, but what oculus rift is a, it's like a ski goggle thing that you put on that is a virtual reality program, uh, that runs while this is happening and a lot of what they're doing when they're running these just recording these incredible scenarios where you, uh, apparently they put cameras all over a person's body and they have them go through these rooms and then they take all of the data from all of that and then, uh, put it into this program so that when you're wearing these goggles, you can look around up and down and there is data.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       That's what it looks like. Oh, cool. There is data for every single aspect of the room, every single area of the room. So as you look left and right, all that's been covered and it's all computing, so as computational power and video cards and all these different things that can compute the visual images as they improve and get better and better. It's gotten to the point now where it's four k, four k is what this television right here is, which is the latest, greatest version of hd. It's very high resolution, beautiful images. And my friend Duncan put it on, try it out at one of these developer conferences and called me just screaming and raving. He's like, this is bigger than the Internet. This is bigger than the wheel. This is the biggest thing. He's like, this is gonna fucking change everything. Um, he walked into a room in this virtual reality demonstration and there was a man playing the piano piano.

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       What does that man playing the piano? The Piano sounded more a more realistic. As he got closer to it, it got louder. Um, he could see the man playing it. He would step to the side and see the man playing it, look over the top of the piano, see the man playing, go underneath the piano and see the man playing. He's like, this is fucking crazy, and it really looks like there's a guy in front of you playing the piano, but nothing's happening. The idea being that if that technology exists today in 2015, there is going to come a time whether that time is 100 years from now or a thousand years from now where there will be an artificial reality that is indecipherable from the reality that we live in right now from this touch, feel, hear, see reality, that we just all accept as real.

Speaker 1:          00:54:39       That there's going to be something that is artificially created but is indistinguishable from what we're experiencing and if that is true, how do we not know that we haven't already been in it? How do we not know? Because if we're not talking about Voodoo, we're talking about technology and we're talking about pretty trackable stuff, like if you follow Moore's law, if you follow the any of the technological laws of extrapolation from the point that we're at now, to the point that they're projecting just within five, 10, 15, 20 years, they're talking about incredible. So if you've seen magic leap, if you seen them. I was going to say I haven't seen the matrix either, but it sounds like that's sort of the simpsons. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's similar along those lines. Matrix seemed like a total horseshit. Just when it came out it seemed like, wow, this is a cool science fiction movie about some shit that's not real.

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       Right. I never could be real, but now the matrix looks closer and closer to reality with every passing day, with every passing year it looks like, wow, it's inevitable whether it's 100 years from now or whatever, they're going to be able to give you an experience that is indistinguishable from this experience that we think is real. You know, my only sort of jumping point for him while he's talking about when I was a student in computer science and math, I took artificial intelligence, but now this is going back to not to date myself, uh, you know, the twenties, 1985, about 1984 85. And at the time one of the things that we had learned in that in this course was. So do you know about how now there are computers that can easily match, uh, the grandmasters and chest? Yes. So at the time when I was in school,

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       some of the early versions of those, uh, computers, uh, we're just about at the level of the grand masters. And so one of the assignments that we had to do in that course was to develop an algorithm. So if you look at the chest, a decision tree, the number of nodes that it has is something like, I can't remember the exact moment. You could probably pull it out something. I tend to the 100 possibilities. And so it will take you more than the, the, the, the age of the universe if you want it to exhaustively search through every possible option to rather what you have to do is use some sort of search algorithm to prune out to weed out huge parts of the decision tree. You see what I'm saying? So that way, this huge decision tree, you only go through the parts that seem promising.

Speaker 3:          00:57:11       And so we had, we didn't do it for chest with the different other game, but at that time I already had founded almost mystical, uh, the type of stuff that we were learning and ai to try to sort of model this artificial intelligence that could mimic the capacities of a human grandmaster player. And what you're talking about, of course, as many generations ahead of that. So incredible stuff. Managing, managing generations ahead of that. And again, you're talking about 30 years, it's not that long. It's really not in terms of culture, it's like if you went by, if 30 years went by in the 12 hundreds, nothing will change. True. Nothing. And 30 years today is almost an eternity when it comes to technology. Well actually yesterday we were sitting at the beach in Laguna, my wife and I and the kids and uh, I asked her and I, I wonder if you have an answer to this.

Speaker 3:          00:57:58       I'm sure we could pull it up. How many people today still use non smartphones, right? I mean, I, I joined the fear but so probably you think like five percent. Um, if I had to guess, I'd bet it's less than that, but it's about 10 or I bet it's a rather. Um, one percent. No, I was going to say three. But I would say, um, I would bet that out of all the people that use cell phones on a regular basis, yeah, I would say it's less than five percent. I would say it's probably around three or something like that. Less than 10 for sure. What do you think, Jamie? What would you guess? Three? Like three percent if you like, if you see people that are walking around. I'm trying to think. I mean, last time I saw, I can't remember the last time that I saw somebody sort of flipping a phone.

Speaker 3:          00:58:51       I think my mom has one still write text me. It's pretty obvious. You're still like let her, you choose you. If you have an iphone you use you instead of why are you. You're lazy bitch. Just write why. Oh, you. Jesus Christ. I'm not going to agree with that sentiment, mother. No, not my mom. My mom has. She doesn't have a smart phone, right? Least. I don't think she does. Um, what uh, what is the percentage Jamie percentage of people that don't use smartphone? Just all. I can find this. There's two thirds of American adults have a smartphone. So I guess it'd be that one third don't. So I don't know if that's a fit. Yeah. What does that mean though? Was that kind of follows? A lot of them may not have any phones. They're fucking animals. If you're living in 2015, you don't have a cell phone, you're some fucking barbarian creature.

Speaker 3:          00:59:40       That doesn't make any sense. I've got A. I've got a good jumping point from because we were talking about innovations. You ready for this birth order and innovations birth order, your birth order as far as like where you were born, right? So you ready for this? First, I'll give you the background of that story and then I'll tell you about some research that we did in a consumer context. So there's this gentleman by the name of Frank Salloway. He's a historian of science and a huge Darwin supporter. He wrote a book in Nineteen Ninety six, highly recommended called born to rebel where he looked at the 28 most radical scientific innovations and the history of human thought. Okay. The reason for 28, there's nothing magical about number 28. There was some criterion by which something got into that list or not. So he looked at the 28th most radical scientific innovation theory of evolution would be one, right?

Speaker 3:          01:00:28       Something that really changed our understanding of the world and then he looked at the birth order through historical records of either the people who espouse the theory or those who were the staunchest, the tractors, opponents to the theory. And what he found is that the later borns, we're much more likely to be the ones to espouse the radical scientific innovations. Wow. Now, I'll explain in a second why, uh, so he argued basically that when a child is born, the first sort of adaptive problem that he has to solve is how to maximize parental investment to, to, to, to himself or herself. And the way you do that is by occupying a unique niche in the eyes of your parents. So if your firstborn, uh, there are no other niches that have been occupied. So for example, in each would be I want to be a good boy.

Speaker 3:          01:01:23       I want to be a rebel would be another niche, right? So that he called this Darwinian partitioning niche hypothesis, right? So it's, it's, it's a positioning proposition, right? How do I position myself to be maximally different from all the other children? So the first, the first, uh, born has nobody, all the niches are available as you go down the cip ship, there are fewer and fewer niches that are available. This forces later barns to be more out of the box thinkers to be more malleable, to be less rigid, to be less conforming. And, and the data was actually quite astonishing. So for 23 out of the 28th radical scientific innovations, that's exactly what he found. Incidentally. Do you want to guess what the Godfather's birth orders last? Thank you. Fourth of four. That's why I always said expect great things from the Godfather. It's meant to be. But, but anyways, so, so we took this idea and we applied it to, since we were talking about adoption

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       of phones and cell phones, smart phones, we applied it to the context of are you a product innovator? Jus adopt something early or late and so on. And we exactly replicated celebrates findings. Firstborns were much more conforming later. Bourns were much more innovative in the product context. So we took the idea of way and applied in a consumer context that actually makes a ton of sense. Another thing I think could possibly be a consideration is that when you're younger you get fucked with by your older brothers and sisters because they can, because they're tired of taking shit from the parents and you're forced to think outside the box because you got to work around. Those fuckers are constantly trying to mess your game up. At every point in turn they cheat, they make up rules. They tell you what mom said, well mom didn't really say anything yet.

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       You get in trouble the last born now, first hot. Okay. I know devious. I don't do that. You're not supposed to have all these statues as the firstborn. There was no. Well, only in only in the conforming sense. On the other hand, you could argue that maybe within your social media this is conforming, right? So it could be. Yeah. Or you just liked tattoos or he just liked that it was. And you're not scared of pain. Right? I think that's more likely, right? Oh yeah. I think it's fascinating when you look at what causes someone to be innovative and what causes someone mean. It's one of the things that I've thought of as a parent and um, many my friends have the same issue. It's all my interesting friends came from fucked up childhoods. All my interesting friends had parents that were a mess and they all childhood was chaos and it forced them to develop a unique character, right?

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       All of them. And I'm trying my best to make my children's lives as easy and comfortable as possible. But in doing so, am I hampering them right hampering their development and some sort of a whiteboard or around them, around them, smack on every now and then just to keep it, push them my way. No, just I think that there's other ways, and this is my theory, there's other ways to encourage innovation or creativity or to pursue your passions and dreams. And one of the things that I'm also quite shocked at, um, with having children is how absolutely, absolutely unique. They are right out of the box in a happy environment with no stress, no financial issues. No, there's no arguing and screaming from the parents, like what is it about kids had to those right out of the vagina are just a totally different person, like from day one made from each other.

Speaker 1:          01:05:00       Yes. So different. So different. That speaks to the fact that there are an innate elements to our personhood, right? Or astrology. Astrology, yes. Yes. Maybe that's real. That's what it may be. You need to just come over to the mystical side a a little bit, Mr. Simon to do that. Have you ever talked to someone who can read those? My wild fennel aunt. Oh really? What? You already forgot what we spoke about? No, but can she read those charts? No, she could read the. This, the, the coffee stains. No, but that's nonsense. That's talks about astrological stuff. Yeah. You know those people that can read those things were mercury's in retrograde and they know we're Pluto is the time your dad came and your mom. I think I can figure that stuff out on hung around in those circles, so unfortunately not enough. Apparently there are people that are absolutely consumed by the Uber Complex aspects of astrology, like real astrology now, like the stuff that you get in your Sunday paper, Oh, I'm a Leo, so today's a good day to take a shit or whatever the hell it would be.

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       Right. All those really random, but apparently there's just volumes of books written on constellations and the alignment of these constellations and where the stars are at any particular time and it's dependent upon what time of year, what time of day do you buy into that in any way, shape or form? Because there are a lot of people that believe that Leo's have a very distinct personality and have distinct personality traits that are trackable. I don't care about Leo's. I'm libra telling me about. I don't know, but I'm Aaliyah. I don't even understand the good looking. Very charismatic. Very brilliant. What happened to you? I know I hired. That's the outlier. I'm the black sheep. Wait a minute. Black sheep. That's triggering tracy. Yes. You. Then you said trigger, which is even more of a trigger, right? Oh my God. I'm so triggered. I didn't even know what to do.

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       Here's another one that I wanted to bring up with you about that trigger ship because it was something that you were helping about. You sent me and I went, wow, we tweeted it. Oh my God. It was. It was about. I was so angry. The woman who was a professor or Kipnis. Yes. Explained the story because I'm. I'm searching. So basically the idea is that there's all these movements about, you know, how horrifyingly violent campuses are in terms of sexual violence, which is of course not true. And she had written an article where she was criticizing that position, sort of the lunacy, the hysteria involved with that narrative, right. One out of every five women will be raped on canvas, which is complete nonsense, isn't nonsense. What, what, what are the actual numbers? So I don't, I haven't studied it carefully, but I thought that was true.

Speaker 1:          01:07:47       Well, because it depends how you defined. Right? So I think if you look at them exactly right. Right. So the, so exactly the male, because the male gaze is a form of visual rape. That's why, by the way, that's why I've written an article about this. You should check it out. Uh, the bikini is patriarchal oppression. While the Burka is liberating. This is western feminists who argue this and they argue this because. Exactly using the argument of the male gaze, since the Burka liberates women from the male gaze and the bikini draws the male gaze, the bikini is bad. The burke as good. What is the grape smuggler? What's the grid smarter? That's where men were a little, little, tiny little John Claude van Damme underwear. Things that people were like in France and stuff, you know, it was a little bikini that, that reference went over my head.

Speaker 1:          01:08:37       Oh, you mean like this? The little speedos? Yeah. Speedos, but. Well, women don't respond to the visual stimuli the way that men do too. Where? Oh, you say that. Evolutionary psychology. Come on. Listen, when girls see channing tatum doing that Magic Mike Shit, dancing around on stage, you tell me the not responding to visual stimuli. Get the fuck. I hear a bunch of convenient bullshit by guys who have shitty bodies. We don't want to think their girlfriends drooling a channing tatum with his little fucking daisy dukes on or whatever. He's wearing his construction, so you actually think that is in that men and women are indistinguishable in the manner by which they respond to. It didn't say that. I didn't say that, but they absolutely respond visually. That's the reason why men want to have six packs wise because girls get excited by it. It's very simple.

Speaker 1:          01:09:25       I just don't think it's the same sort of stem. I think there's there's pursuit stimuli where a guy will see a girl who's got a hot bag into bikini and go, oh Jesus, and they literally go running up to them to try to talk to them. Yes. I don't think that same thing happens with females to males as much, but the idea, but I think that's also just gender roles, has deal with testosterone, has to deal with many, many things. Culture, the normal behavior as far as male, female behavior. I think both sexes, when they look at each other, are looking for a important cues that are relevant to the American market. So you're absolutely right that women are looking, for example, they like tight buttocks because that sends an important signal for size and shape of the sperm point nine waist to hip ratio on a mass of the swimmers.

Speaker 1:          01:10:16       The male swimmers build is very have wide shoulders, thin waist. So, so I'm not suggesting that women don't respond to visual cues, but they certainly don't respond nearly as much as men. I think they respond probably in an equal, uh, within equal intensity but not act in an equal intensity and certainly not act in a threatening way. And that's where the male gaze comes in. So why aren't there a million a male stripper shops targeting heterosexual women? You should get into that market like a lot of. Well, there is a lot of male strip shows and in fact in vegas, those are the things that they advertise the airport when you go there, the thunder down under and all this jazz. Bunch of guys with their shirts off sweaty, but women don't feel comfortable going into those environments the way men feel comfortable. So they go in these packs of wild estrogen creatures and they scream and yell. I used to have a bit about it that it's a totally that ladies'

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       night out. It's a totally different kind of experience when they go leave, they scream and cheer and yell. Where guys sit there and don't say much of anything. He just kind of stare like that speaks predatory. Exactly. There's definitely a difference. It's sisterhood of the pants or whatever. That right there. They're banding together, right? I just think that women don't have the correct outlet, which is why when a book like 50 shades of grey comes out, they all go fucking bananas. Like finally we've got a channel to to funnel. All of our sex urge is through right now. You see them read their reading porn on planes. You're passing by on planes. They're reading gag porn. Well, by the way, if you want to understand male versus female sexuality, I don't you do, but please, if you. If you want to understand male sexuality than you do a content analysis of pornography.

Speaker 2:          01:12:04       If you want to understand female sexuality, you do a content analysis of romance novels. It's true, right? So if you look at the archetype of the, and that's going to speak to your six back about the pretty guy. Uh, if you look at the archetype of the male hero in romance novels, irrespective of which culture the romance novel is written, and it's going to be Romania or Egypt or your Newport beach, he's always the same guy. He's a tall guy. He's got a six pack. He's account meaning, right? He's also a neurosurgeon. He wrestles alligators on his six back. He's reckless. He's risky, but only to be tamed by the love of that one woman. Right? So I've already told you about the every single archetype that you've, I mean the same archetype and every romance novel. The reason why the archetype is there is because it exactly caters to women's fantasies.

Speaker 2:          01:12:51       And sometimes he's like half a chick. Like he's got long hair and like very chique like behavior. He wears, like flowing very sheer shirts, which no guy in their right mind would ever wear. And if you did where women would mock you, right? Right. If you were, if you have long flowing fabio hair and you had like a, a, like a blouse on and you went out to a nightclub, people go with a fuck is wrong with that guy. But in a romance novel, you're on the cover baby. Well, because you have to also send out some cues of sensitivity, right? Is that what that is? It's an artistic. It's a bit sensitive. So. So guess it's just not a real person, just like the vampires when there's a reason why women fell in love with those fucking stupid vampires. Like why? Why is that? Vampires that don't even burn up in the sun. They sparkle like what was all that about? Um, I dunno. Those narratives on dairy, you twilight, goddammit. I don't watch that stuff. Sorry. New. I'm too busy watching Lionel Messi a right, right, right. Well, those books sold fucking millions of the vampire ones. Yes. Millions and millions of copies. And they were essentially a form of romance porn vampire bullshit for chicks. And again, these men in these books, these vampires, they didn't exist. Not only did they not exist, they didn't make sense. Like the main

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       one, that one that uh, you know, there's Christian, whatever the hell her name was and ed, whatever the fuck his name is rob, whatever the fuck his name. I don't know any of those that carry out. The guy was supposed to bleed like 90 years old or something like that. He got, he got like in the Spanish plague is when he died and that's when it became a vampire, but he has to still go to high school because when it became a vampire he was like 17, so he has to show up and go to high school with all normal people. But he goes to high school in the Pacific northwest because it's never sunny out. So he doesn't glitter. It's one of the dumbest fucking books of all time. Why don't you get watch that stuff? Well, I didn't talk. Know a lot about a lot about it.

Speaker 1:          01:14:50       I've watched little moments of it before I panicked and shut it off. Right. I actually did watch one of them, I think I watched the second one anyway, point being watched. The one with. They became Werewolf's. It was fucking so stupid. It made me mad. But point being like, this guy is 90 fucking years old and he's hanging around with 17 year old. That guy's an asshole, right? He's pretending to be 17. He falls in love with the 17 year old navy and had sex with her eventually, which is pedophilia and then we're really pedal. Not just pedophilia but like, what the fuck is wrong with you? What do you have in common? You've been around for 90 years and you've got something in common with this girl who's 17 years old. It's fucking ridiculous. No more than 90 years really because in the 19 twenties or whatever the hell it was, we're assuming that he was 17 years old then, so he's more than 100 years old.

Speaker 1:          01:15:37       It's, it's the dumbest fucking book of all time, but it was huge. Women loved it and it didn't represent a real person and he represented the exact opposite of a real person. Like what guys like actually exists, guys like sluts. Okay. And those are real. And I, when I say slots, it was all due respect. I'm not slut shaming, which is by the way another trigger. Yes. Don't slut. Shame is because then you're, you're mocking girls for their ability to choose their sexual partners as part of the patriarchy. Yes. Yes it is, right? Yes. Yes. I'm strongly against the patriarchy. Are you going to get in trouble for this podcast and the way he's not at all. Last time you didn't know. No one said anything and I mean some trolls. Do they usually it was a Jew that you choose. You Ju Ju got mad at you for being Jewish.

Speaker 1:          01:16:23       Julie's as Zionists shields. June. Uh, that's usually the extent of the negative stuff. I've done a damn sign. The shills yeah. Let's go back to your friend Laura Kipnis did say her name, Kiss Kiss, Kiss Laura Kipnis. She is a professor at northwestern university. So she wrote this essay, a chronicle of higher education. And in the article in the Atlantic it brings it up describing a new campus politics of sexual paranoia. And she was then subject to a long investigation after students who were offended by the articles and by a tweet that she sent file filed a chapter nine complaint against her. Now what does that mean? I think it's that, uh, you know, women should have equal access to education and so on. I'd be in a safe, you know, like she was somehow suppressing. Well because by her, by

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       her, uh, making light of the endemic sexual violence on campus and quotes, she was condoning it and therefore she was making all these women feel unsafe and unwelcomed and threatened on campus. And so two students, uh, started that process. Now I don't know the details. I mean I'm not a constitutional lawyer, but basically once sort of the, the complaint is filed, then sort of the train starts and it becomes this orwellian thing that that's just, I mean it's just, it's, it's a complete nightmare. And so I read that stuff and I just got so angry and I spent pretty much that whole day rallying up the forces in your kind enough to treat it and just, you know, your tweet got me something like 100,000 views. Uh, and then I communicated with her because I wanted to send her a signal that, you know, there are some of us that still have to stickler fortitude that are willing to. I mean, in academia you shouldn't even say

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       gesticulate trigger that it's for men. Why counterparts compatriot. Sure. Uh, and, and so, you know, I just wanted to, to tell her that, uh, some of us were supporting her. Yeah. I read it and I thought it was really serving. I thought it was really disturbing because it just seems so common. That's the most disturbing aspect. There was not some unusual occurrence where kids are freaking out about nothing and overreacting. Where you could look at it like, what is this? It's like, oh, this again, you know. And that's what bugs me the most about it. It's this, again, it's the idea that looking at data and looking at the realities of the climate of free speech on these campuses and how it's oppressed and it's not free speech, you are free to think as they do know and if you don't think as they do, you're not free.

Speaker 3:          01:18:53       That's right. You know, this issue of how cowardly most academics have become. And I, and I say this, realizing that I'm going to piss off many of my colleagues. I'm astonished how academics who are in the business of engaging in public discourse are so tepid because they've been silenced and to fear. And I mean, I see it in many, many different ways, but I'll just share one example which I think I shared in another show recently. So if I put up a, a, a clip on facebook, have a Iraqi astronomer who was arguing that, uh, in the Koran it says that the earth is flat and it's clear that the earth is flat. Okay? So I shared that clip to demonstrate sort of the lunacy that, uh, you know, religious dogma I can have on an otherwise supposedly intelligent person. I mean Iraqi astronomer now, what do you think the reaction was of Islamophobia?

Speaker 3:          01:19:48       Zionist asshole. He's allowed to have those thoughts. He's part of a suppressed culture, right? So she didn't, she didn't have the courage to tackle me that way, but she wrote on my publicly not privately, uh, this wasn't academic white woman from California who's written with guilt and hate her in a. She wrote to me saying, you know, don't you think that, you know, it's bad of you to be sharing this, don't you think it's bad that you're sort of stigmatizing them? So step for a second and think about what this means, right? This scientist, colleague of mine was not offended that a fellow scientists would actually hold such a astonishingly false position. Right? He's a member of the flat Earth Society. Rather, she was offended that I would point to his lunacy. So that I think that small anecdote really captures the culture of fear that you see on campuses. And in a sense, if I can sort of toot my own horn, I'm, I'm really a very rare breed, sort of the guy who walks around not caring a saying it as it is, because that's my personality. I can't be anything else,

Speaker 1:          01:20:53       but you also are a very open minded guy and so when it comes down to like the core values of these people promote, whether it is a lack of racial insensitivity or racial stereotyping, gender issues, whether it's sexism or homophobia, you're, you're on the liberal side of all that stuff. But so you're. So you're essentially a liberal, right?

Speaker 3:          01:21:21       If I can say I'm a true liberal, not the liberals that exist today because the liberals have today as our common friend, Sam Harris and Ayaan Hirsi Ali have said, have a huge blind spot when it comes to certain issues where they fall really on the wrong side of the issue. So a true liberal is one who doesn't Miss Ward, who doesn't fall prey to cultural and moral relativism. Who doesn't say, well, who are we to judge the cutting off of Clarissa's of women? That's their culture, right? So that's a true liberal,

Speaker 1:          01:21:50       so not a true liberal. They're not, they're fake liberals. Well, I think what they're doing is they're subscribing to the current trend of, of discourse. Right. And the current trend of discourse is anything Islamic, leave it alone. Yes. And uh, I think a lot of that's being a pussy. Yeah, I really do. I think a lot of that is cowardice. They're afraid of backlash. They're afraid of a label. Islamophobia is a very strange label because there's no Christian have phobia and even antisemetic, you know, there, there's a certain amount of antisemetic, a logic and thinking that is promoted in certain Islamic cultures that's ignored as well. So you can, you can get away with that in certain ways. Like, did you see that video of the guy that was walking through Paris dressed in a Jewish way? Yes. Whoa. Was that fucking disturbing? If, uh, if you haven't seen it, it is. It's just showing how openly in, in the most sickening way openly anti Jewish. So many people are in, in Paris,

Speaker 3:          01:22:58       by the way. I should make it clear. And of course now there'll be the hate comments. Uh, it's not anti Israel, right? It's,

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       yes, it's anti Jewish. It's antisemitic. One hundred percent. I don't like the term symmetric because some medic is like some many people. It's represents a lot of people that aren't Jewish. It's anti Jewish, right? I mean, although the term is understood, typically symmetric means it's anonymous, but your point is well taken. Why is his antisemitic? Because there's a lot of Semitic cultures that aren't Jewish. I don't know the sort of the original historical context for why that tool when you want to appear to be smart, you say antisemetic, you don't say anti Jewish. That's right. It sounds a bit more. More educated, more educated since confirmed dummy. I can go with anti Jewish. Well, pick up the route. Can't be. You can't be a dummy and a good comic, which you are. Because as I think we might've discussed before, or maybe we didn't, there was a correlation between being funny and being highly intelligent.

Speaker 1:          01:23:56       But whether you probably have. There's a type of intelligence like mathematically on basically retarded. I'm really, but you probably have good social intelligence, right, because I'm able to come up with those anecdotes, right? You actually have acuity to see patterns in terms of social interactions. Otherwise, what will be much for Pat, myself on the back. So I'll let you do that real quick and then we'll move on. Well, I'm overwhelmed by your charisma, Joe. Thank you very much sir. But getting back to this video, um, I didn't see anyone freaking out over it, but anything that may be a Sam Harris, our friend would say over overblown and blown out of proportion to the extreme because it's a target because that label Islamophobia is so. He's like when Ben Affleck that fucking dumb ass when he went after him on the bill Maher show and just like really like, it was such an obvious ploy to like fit into that idea.

Speaker 1:          01:24:53       The eye. It wasn't like a well thought out, well examined point of view. It was like, I can't believe what you're saying. What you're saying. So racist. He's arrogant and his ignorance. Yes. Arrogant in the fact that he felt like this was an easy thing to pull off. That's what. And he'd get the applause from the audience. He was searching for Social Brownie points, surfing Social Brownie points, going back to the, to the anti Jewish stuff. I mean, I grew up in Lebanon, as you know, and I'm Jewish, I mean an atheist, but I'm Jewish. Tough accent by the way, for anybody who's going to write and say, well, how could he be Jewish and atheist? You can be both. Some of the most famous Jews were all atheists. Judaism is more than just adherence to a set of religious narratives, right? There's a cultural element. There is a historical element. There are all sorts of fastest to being Jewish that don't necessarily mean you have to believe in Booga Booga stuff, right? Booga Booga not going to get hate mail from the rabbis hate from the Buddha. Buddha too. But anyways, uh, so I grew up in Lebanon, uh, now you might say, oh, but Lebanon was such a progressive, tolerant, wonderful place where everybody got along. I wouldn't say that I used to date a Lebanese girl. And what did say she told me it's

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       fucking craziness. Was it that she was. Well, she grew up in America, but her family was from Lebanon and she, you know, well, the, the, the typical sort of narrative that you hear is that Lebanon was of all countries in the Middle East was the most progressive one and have to some extent that was true. But what they don't understand is that progressive in the context of the Middle East is very, very different than progressive in the West. Right? So if you were Jewish, you were quilt tolerated. That means that will tolerate you until we no longer tolerate you. Enhanced. That's why we left Lebanon because we were going to be executed. Right. Uh, so, uh, I grew up sort of with a dark secret. I'm Jewish. I mean, right. You didn't wear a star of David. Now if people wanted to find out if you were Jewish, they could easily do that.

Speaker 3:          01:26:46       They could go to synagogue on Saturday. And so it's not as though it was absolutely hidden, but you certainly, you know, know your place amongst the greater crowd. You're a minority and we tolerate you. You live, if you like, if I don't know if you know the term, do you know the term? They may know them as a second, third class citizen as enshrined in the Islamic texts for people at the book, meaning Christians and Jews. Meaning monotheists, right? Not, not the Pagans, not the polytheist, not the Hindus, not the, not the Buddhist, not the atheist, but Jews and Christians under Islamic law could be afforded protection as long as they paid the right. That means they pay sort of a poll tax to be protected by their Muslim overlords. Whoa, okay. That's called to live as a Dhimmi. Okay. So in Lebanon, you didn't officially have to pay that poll tax, but what you did is you knew your place.

Speaker 3:          01:27:42       So for example, my brother David, who was a, you would like this because you're a fighter, a guy mma guy. He used to be in the Olympics and judo and Nike 76. Well, in, in the early seventies, he had won several Lebanese championships and then one day he was visited by some guys who told him that, you know, Jew, boy, it's time to sort of stop winning. So it's time to retire or else you end up at the bottom of a river. Then he left to pursue his career in judo and France. This was before the civil war stuff. My, my, when we, when we escaped Lebanon, I mean, literally we're escaping execution when, when the, uh, this is the first time that anybody hears this particular story. So you're, that's your birthday gift. So, uh, as we, as we, as the captain said that we were out of Lebanese airspace, this is when we're leaving Lebanon to, to immigrate to Canada. Uh, and he says, we're out of Lebanese. My mother takes out a star of David, puts it around my neck and says, now you don't have to hide who you are. Now this is in progressive Lebanon, pluralistic Lebanon. So now, now watch what's gonna happen. Now I'm going to receive comments of people saying what a hate monger he is. He's just trying to make those other folks look bad. So my whole personal history as somehow negated, I'm either making it up or

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       why am I talking about this? Why are you making. So I'm the hateful guy for mentioning that I escaped execution of others. Well, I don't think you should pay those people any minds for certainly not address them when they're not even communicating with you. You like sort of artificially bringing up their voices and then responding to their voices. There's no need for that godfather move on. Um, but this, uh, it, it disturbed me that this video wasn't this video of this guy walking through Paris. Was He, he was a Jewish gentleman who was dressed as, he was exciting. He was, it was, it was like that girl that walked through Manhattan and got all the cat. Exactly. That's exactly the idea behind it was to sort of. There is everybody knows it's similar. There's an almost the identical clip in Cairo. You could look it up on youtube where a guy where's sort of the aesthetic look and he starts walking around Cairo and it's not pretty.

Speaker 1:          01:29:56       What lucky you didn't get killed, right? It's just so fucking crazy that we're in this world where we're at now where people are so terrified of the label, Islamophobia and of Islam, of what happened with Charlie Hebdo. Yes. Things along those lines. The Charlie Hebdo, if you don't know the story, it's a magazine and Paris, they would draw these cartoons of Muhammad and they were uh, all the cartoonists were killed by gunman, Muslim government. So what does it say right here? Scroll down to the top please. Jamie walk. Watch the abuse the Jewish man gets as you walk through Paris. And this is from [inaudible] dot com and it's just fucking crazy. The team film for Ten hours to get 90 seconds of material that they had to go to the roughest parts of Paris to get. Oh, so they're saying, okay. So this is very similar. Right? So, um, so what they're saying I guess is that they really kind of blew it out of proportion because they edited it down from this 10 hours to get, to get 90 seconds.

Speaker 1:          01:30:59       Is that what they're saying? Jamie said 90 seconds. Yeah. Okay. I, you don't need to watch the youtube clip. I just have to tell you about my personal history in Lebanon. Do you want to hear some more stuff? I'd love to. I'm maybe nine years old. Uh, maybe the equivalent of great for here. Great. Three or four teacher says, okay, everybody, here's the exercise for the next whatever, half an hour. Get up and tell the class what you want to be when you grew up. So, uh, hi, my name. I want to be a soccer player. I want to be a policeman. I want to be this. He gets up, I remember his name. I actually couldn't even recognize his face and the old photos. It says, when I grow up teacher, I want to be a Jew. Killer, killer, killer. Everybody breaks out into applause. Now, does that mean that everybody in Lebanon was this Rabid Anti Semite? Of course not. But is, is, is our dose feelings pervasive through out every social fabric, whether it be on TV and political speeches and dramas and soap operas.

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       It, it's everywhere. It's endemic to every single DNA of those societies. Uh, and so that's why you have these types of problems. I'll give you another quick example of school, but that one real quick, if you don't mind, please do. So now we're getting into some serious nine years old, nine years old, nine eight, 10 minutes radios in that area. And um, what, what was going through your mind? And this is a time where you kind of, you as you said, you knew your place, so you, you, you didn't, you didn't openly talk about your Judaism or. Yeah, I mean you're just, you know, you did. People know you because you know, you're Jewish so it's not, it's not. Your students did know I was, I was a student, but do you think this too, I mean, just your students follow suit? My cohorts. I think many of them probably didn't know that I was Jewish.

Speaker 3:          01:32:46       Uh, uh, I'm almost certain. I mean, I don't know, I didn't sit there and talk about these issues as a kid said Ju killer. Whoa, what the fuck man? What, what did, what did that feel like? Well, it, it, it feels like you're different. It feels like you're in a precarious situation always. It feels like a, you know, uh, and French. There's an expression swab bell, which means a, be pretty and sit quietly, right? Uh, that's what it know your place. Okay. So that's what it means to be tolerant, right? To be tolerated. It's not, it's not that you're equal right here. Never equal. You can't be prime minister of Lebanon as a Jew. I'll give you another quick story. Uh, uh, there was a general Egyptian politics from say the seventies. There was a Abdulnasser was a famous Pan Arabesque who brought together the Arab world.

Speaker 3:          01:33:37       He was an Egyptian, a president who, who was viewed as the hero because he was going to sort of unite the Arab world against the colonial powers and so on. And so he was this kind of larger than life superhero of the Arab world when he died in 1970, as often happens in the Middle East, there are all these incredibly sort of violent demonstrations on the streets. And I was sitting in my house. I was maybe five years old, almost six. And as this mass of people pass, by all you hear that the Jews, the Jews, what, what did the Jews have to do with this politician passing away in Egypt? But that's just the reflex, right? I mean, it must be some Zionist conspiracy. It must be. So I'm sitting there sort of hiding in my balcony as these people are passing and it's etched in my memory, the chance of death to Jews.

Speaker 3:          01:34:29       And there are all these sort of Arabic chance that I could repeat now that you know, people wouldn't understand them. That's just part of how things were. Now, does that mean that on every single day, every single day of my life there I was being persecuted. Of course not right. I mean I lived a normal life until I was going to be executed. So that's the reality of the Middle East. And that's why today you almost have no religious minorities to speak of and you were in the Middle East, right? I mean, the remaining bastions of Christianity in the Middle East are now either being clobbered or they're forced to leave right? In Iraq, in, uh, the cops in Egypt to some extent now we're seeing it also in Nigeria. Uh, and so, you know, this idea that we all kind of coexist in the released. This is Bologna. It's not true. You're tolerated at best.

Speaker 3:          01:35:19       What are the, what was the percentage of people that were Jews in Lebanon when you were there? So at the, so we were part of the last remaining Jews in Lebanon at one point I think I could be off on the numbers and you'll correct me if I'm wrong later, maybe in the descriptor, maybe 15,000 at most. 15, $20,000 out of a population of about maybe $3 million at the zenith. Right? So a very small minority. Now when Israel came along in 1948, it made it that much more difficult to be Jewish and Arab countries. Now this is not to give cover to antisemitism, which is independent of Israel, right? Antisemitism has existed for 1400 years in those parts of the world independently of Israel. But once Israel came about in 1948, it just made it that much more precarious for Jews to live in Libya and Iraq and in Egypt and in Syria and Lebanon.

Speaker 3:          01:36:10       And so they'd be these mass exoduses of Jews from Arab lands, sometimes forced other times by choice because it just became untenable for Jews to be there. We were part of the last wave of remaining Jews because we were very entrenched within Lebanese society. Uh, but then once the civil war started and it just wasn't possible to be there in Lebanon, you had these internal ID cards that you carried around like a passport, but internally that stated your religion on it. So in the context of the Lebanese civil war where they would set up these roadblocks, these militia would set up roadblocks. If you get to a roadblock and somebody says in Arabic, you say how we give me your, your, your, uh, your ID card. Well, that ID card has your religion on it. If you're the wrong religion, it's good. Bye. Well, that was what's going on with the Sunni and Shiite in Iraq. Exactly, exactly. Roadblocks, roadblocks to kill people. Well, the problem in the Middle East is that you have endless abrahamic religions. And again, it's not just the Mazda, and I'm not trying to be relativists here, but all the abrahamic religions sort of have a narrative of uniqueness and it's very, very hard to coexist when you know, each of us is the chosen people.

Speaker 1:          01:37:26       I have my theory about the Middle East and my theory is that they're the townies of the world. What does that mean? The townies are the people that never left their neighborhood. And if you, if you look at the cradle of civilization, it's Babylon. It's sue mayor. So that's the oldest written language, oldest mathematics, that's where Iraq is, right? And that area is a clusterfuck today. And everybody moved out of there. Everybody moved out of Africa. Africa's chaos, right? We all know that. Um, I

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       think that much like small towns, you grow up in and if you go back, there you go, Jesus, he's fucking assholes are still hanging around the high school, you know, being annoying at the gas station. They, the same people there. They're stuck in the same way. They have not evolved, they have not moved past the rest of the world has and it seems like with a lot of these religions, they're so rigid in their ideology and the standards of their behavior and the classifications of the individuals that are involved in it, that it's almost inescapable. These rigid ideology seem like it's the idea of progressive thinking or progressive thought. It's almost. They're almost mutually exclusive. You can't have that and exist in that. In that form. Coalitional thinking is a endemic part of human psychology, right? The idea of us versus them as part of human nature and what these Abrahamic religions do is they take this and they put her on steroids.

Speaker 2:          01:38:56       Right? I mean it it. It is a great study. I can't remember who it is or I might punch it up a bit, but it goes something like this. You're bringing people into the lab and you make them wait in the waiting area and you just put a sticker either blue or red on them and then you say, Oh, you're not going to come back in a few minutes. I'm going to go off to do something else. I'll be back in a few minutes. The real point of the experiment is to see what people ended up doing during that time that you're out. What do you think happens? The people who have the red sticks read the stickers, start speaking to each other and the people, right, so you're taking a completely random queue and you're forcing people to assort along that cute right now, it's no longer matters what my sexual orientation is or whether I'm Muslim or Christian or Jewish.

Speaker 2:          01:39:39       It's red people band together versus blue people. There are various versions of this experiment that had been done and in classic social psychology, but what that speaks to is this, a inextricable, this, this inescapable trap of coalitional psychology and that's what happens in the Middle East. Everything is viewed through the prism of my faith and anybody who's not my faith is the other and the other is not. To be trusted is to be hated as to be scoring that. Now, that doesn't mean that every single person subscribes to that, but it certainly means that the narrative, the religious narratives certainly condones that, so yeah, with rigid ideologies and tribal behavior and then add that to a very harsh environment, physical environment where it's just unforgiving. It's real hard to move past that real hard to find forgiveness and enlightenment and see in and matter of fact. That was one of the things is another issue that I think, I believe it was Michael Shermer who wrote an article about the difference between Islam and some of the other religions is that they never went through the enlightenment. Right. Well, I think one of the problem, one of the. You now see many a vociferous in public intellectuals that are coming out to a call for an reformation,

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       but that's actually been happening for 1400 years. The problem is it's easy to call for a reformation if you assume that there's something to be reformed. If you think it's perfect. There's nothing to be reformed right here in PA state for even considering that, but if you're going to reform it, how do you go about doing that? When one of the tenants, the tenants, is that in Arabic you say a kid, meaning every single letter of the Koran is immutable, is eternal and it's perfect. Well, how can you have an exit? Just how could you exit just as like a, I'm not pronouncing it right, but like how could you interpret texts or reinterpret texts when in reality you doing that becomes a form of sacrilegious. Right? So that's the problem in the context of the other Abrahamic religions, there was the capacity for the light of reformation to squeeze its way into those little holes so that there could be new interpretations and so on.

Speaker 3:          01:41:52       In Islam it's a bit more of a challenge. So what about people that are Islamic reformers? Who are the members of the people in the. There are people today that considered themselves Muslim but also are atheists. There are people that consider themselves Muslims, like you consider yourself a Jew but you're an atheist. Right? What about those people that don't aren't so ideologically rigid, rigid? Think they all moved right there. Don't move down, and they certainly never openly stated they're not unbelief in the Middle East, during Ramadan with that. That would not be good. Don't be good. They'll fuck you up if you eat during Ramadan. Right? Well, and certainly isis now has killed many people who violated a Ramadan rules, uh, now, of course, then you'll hear back that they're not really. They're not Islamic, right? I do hear that. Listen, I've engaged people in various forums where we start chatting.

Speaker 3:          01:42:44       Then I'll quote something from say, do you know who he is? He's the spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. One of the foremost leaders of the Sunni. A Sec. In terms of as a religious scholar, right? I mean all the perfect right pedigree from an scholar scholars, Islamic scholarship perspective. So I'll quote something by him. What do you think there were about the Olivia, but he's not a real Muslim. Then I'll quote something from the college of the so called Colophon Lysis who has a phd in Islamic Studies. What do you think the answer is not a real Muslim then I'll. Right, so. So it's play. Hide the ball. Right? So. So if you have so much duplicity in your discourse that guys who by definition are leaders and experts of Islam who are then being a. You pretend that they're not Muslim because they say something that you, you find objectionable than how can we have an often and honest discourse you can't, so how do we fix that? That's my my, my, my running. By the way,

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       my last podcast. How do we fix this? I think we fixed it with everything by having people who have the courage as many of some of your guests have and maybe I can include myself in this group who are open, who are honest, who are reasonable, who are not filled with hate to who are dispassionate. Also, they moved all of the moved moved out of the Middle East. So you're just saying that they can't implement these changes on the ground. I'm not saying that, but I'm like, how do you. And I'm not sure if, I think if I've got the answer then I would be getting the Nobel prize. Who is the writer? Uh, something Roy that was hacked to death with the machete rails? Yeah, there has been for them so far. Yeah. He was somewhere else doing a, it was some sort of a speech on his book that he wrote back to Bangladesh was hacked.

Speaker 2:          01:44:41       Yeah. Yeah. Hacked to death by machetes. Um, on the street in front of his wife was hacked up to was horrible. You know what the response is when I've challenged people on that. What they did was not Islamic. Right. Look, let me give you an example. Uh, there was a, uh, a recent Orthodox Jew who in the gay pride parade in Tel Aviv that Ed did you have on this? I did hear about this with stabbing people. Stabbing people, right? Yeah. I mean, he didn't do this because he was alienated. He didn't do this as a response to the financial crisis of 2007, 2008. I'm using examples, by the way, from Russell brand's luminary analysis as to why people join isis. It has nothing to hold up. Russell brand thinks that Russell and I actually, I did a youtube clip, uh, on my youtube channel where I basically covered all this.

Speaker 2:          01:45:31       The comedian Russell brand. Oh yeah. The luminary. Luminary sarcastically. Yes. He basically was arguing that, uh, uh, he, he, he came up with every single possible cause that you could think of other than religious fervor to explain why people move 4,000 miles away to join isis. It was due. So let me give you a few. There were about maybe seven or eight. I covered on my youtube clip, but I'll, I'll try to come up with three or four. They were alienated. They felt that they weren't part of the political process. Want to say it the way he says it? I, I can't, I can't really alienated, didn't feel like they are part of the political process. Yeah. I can't do it as well as you can. Uh, they were, they were upset about the financial meltdown in 2017 financial meltdown. They hated greedy, rampant evil capitalism. Capitalism, right. My son, all the right words. Very good. Uh, so I mean, I mean really that's, that's the reason why people join. I mean there's nothing to do with religion, absolutely nothing to do with it. So how could we have an honest discourse when this is the kind of nonsense that you keep hearing, but you're talking to comedians and again, you're talking to a comedian right now. So any logic out of this healed. He hit some,

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       some people actually challenged me to say, well, why do you even take the time to counter this guy's views? Well, and my answer is he's got a lot bigger platform than I do, right? He has much more power to influence minds than I do. It doesn't matter that I might be better equipped than him as he's an athletic, as there's been athletes and that sort of thing. Exactly. And it seems like they're both kind of fishing for social brownie points instead of calling it Islam or instead of calling it anything, if you just looked at it as a pattern or behavior, and if you looked at that pattern and behavior, this ideological pattern or behavior that would seek out to murder people that don't agree with those thoughts, any rational person would go, well that's crazy, right? That's these, these people are fucked. Like, this is bad, we can't tolerate this.

Speaker 1:          01:47:37       But once you start calling it anything, whether you call it Islam or just fill in the blank, make up your own name for it. And then that becomes an oppressed segment of our civilization, or at least a thought of as an oppressed or boxed into that political, uh, sort of a segment where you're, you're not supposed to shit on it because it's thought to be marginalized already and you're just piling on. But do you think that. So there are 50, I want to go back in a second, the Jewish guy. But let me answer this last point you made. Do you think that in the 57 countries that are a member of the Organization of Islamic cooperation, the OIC, a Muslims are marginalized? No, right? And most of those 57 countries, they constitute an extraordinary majority, if not complete majority of it something. So this, this narrative that Muslims are marginalized. I mean, it's really laughable because I mean, if you think about Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Kuwait, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and on, and on, and on, uh, they're not marginalized.

Speaker 1:          01:48:37       They constitute 99 percent, 100 percent of the population, right? If anything is the religious minorities that are no longer existent there that have been marginalized, right? So it's eliminated, eliminated, or exit or genocidally removed. So this, this, this isn't, it's an informational war. Yes. Now, but that's, that's the most important part. It's an inflammation of war and that information and ideology that it, it's, it's these things, these, these are thoughts and patterns. Instead of calling them religion, instead of calling this, this cherished tradition or cultural, uh, this, this, this ancient thing that you're supposed to worship instead of calling it that, it's, it's ideas. These are ideas, these ideas that this ancient script is directly handed down from God that every word is perfect. If that's not preposterous, you tell me what the fuck is because I get real confused when people who grew up without any science, I mean, they literally knew almost nothing when they wrote this in comparison to what we know today. Obviously back then there were scholars, but right in comparison, it's, it's laughable to think that anybody

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       had all the answers in 1200 or years. The Koran, Britain supposedly in terms of the revelations. So 600 something. 600, so 680. Yeah. About 1400 years ago to try reading any and textbook book from 1400 years ago and finding correct information. Right. What year was Galileo prosecuted? 15 something that's going back to the Jewish guy. Uh, I tweeted about it and I shared it. And of course, uh, he undoubtedly got his ideas from, I think reading leviticus where, you know, if you lay with another man, you should be killed. And so on. Right? So if I make that claim right, which is an absolutely correct claim that for this guy who took his old testament very seriously and then went around knifing people, it's an absolutely appropriate claim to make either didn't get attacked as antisemitic. Right? I mean everybody says, yeah, no kidding. An Orthodox Jew, which is very rare for an orthodox Jew to go around killing people.

Speaker 2:          01:50:49       But the fact that I made that, I could make that link, there was no blow back, but unfortunately the West has now been convinced that if you ever make that link for one particular religion than you are hateful. That's a profoundly dangerous situation to be in. You seem to, it seems to be legal in this game to a. You can shit all over Christians. Yes. No. As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, if you do that, you really progressive amongst my academic friends. If you repeatedly demonstrate what a bunch of buffoons, uh, these Christian Pixar, than that garners you Brownie points. Yeah. Why are Christian Hicks? I'm any less profound than these, you know, because because it slices for Islam, wrongly is associated with Brown people and you don't mess with that, but a lot of baptists are black. True, true. Do people mock southern Baptist as much as they mark like a.

Speaker 2:          01:51:50       that's an open empirical question, right? Yeah, that's a good question. I bet they kind of leave that alone. I start singing and chanting against folks. That's right. It's a lot of people involved. Yes. Solfa old apostolic is ridiculous. It's funny. So it's a, it's, it's tough dealing with all this stuff on a daily basis on twitter and so on. Well, people don't want to be judged in a negative way and especially in this society, in this culture and this easy to, uh, act culture because it's really easy to make a tweet about someone or write a facebook post about someone or a blog entry about someone attacking them. And then once you've done that, boy, you have opened up the flood gates and they will just experience all sorts of pylons from all these other people that are either agree or support or or don't want to be labeled such themselves.

Speaker 2:          01:52:40       So they'll attack you to make sure everyone knows that they're not like you. Right. It's interesting that you say that is because some of the biggest blow back I've gotten on my public facebook page has been, whenever I've called out Russell brand on something, apparently some of my fans are also Russell brand fans, which I don't know how these two worldviews can, can coexist, but they got really upset that, you know, I was being elitist. You know, he's doing a lot of social good. Yes. Some of his stuff is quackery, but he's a good guy. His heart is in the right place and I'm being an asshole for criticizing him. And I really, really at Vitriol for some of these folks. And you don't know, you've never lived in the middle. Oh wait. Oh wait, you've never heard anybody yell, killed it. Oh, you did.

Speaker 2:          01:53:28       Now incidentally, I should. I should mention that my first exposure to Russell brand before I knew about all his funny movies. Well exactly, and one one in one in particular, which I must have seen about 10 times a forgetting. Sarah Marshall. Great movie. Uh, and so I've sat there and laughed and thought it was a very funny guy. And then I came across his political rants and I no longer thought he was such a cool guy. Well, as I've said on twitter, I believe that he is neck deep in hippie pussy right now and really has no idea what's going on. I think they cut off the circulation when there's that much hippie pussy coming at Ya. I think the circulation to your brain, it's very hard for the heart to pump it through all the kisses that he received on his neck. It right. That's the going theory.

Speaker 2:          01:54:10       Okay. That's a pretty good one. Oh, do they throw themselves at that poor guy? Really? Oh yeah. I'm sure. Looking at this beautiful. Okay. Used to date Katy Perry who was married to her son. So what, what happened to that list? Full Union had to save the world, Bro. Popstars. That's true. That's all that frivolous shit. Yeah. She was religious. She was, yeah. I mean, I don't know her exact story, but apparently she was very, very religious and her original sort of foray into the music industry all about, you know, sort of Christian religious music. Yeah. And then when that sort of didn't stick then she became, you know, kind of deviated from that and became a pop star. But her roots are very much a Christian based. Well, you know, I think that a lot of these folks with that, they're trying to do good like a russell.

Speaker 2:          01:55:01       Um, I, I probably, I mean I probably get along with them. Great if I sat down and talked to them and I think he, when I hear him talk and I hear the things that he's saying, I feel like he is doing a lot of good. I think he is opening up a lot of people's eyes because he is a very public figure and he is saying a lot of things that make a lot of sense about the financial world, about, about, about war. And about the nature of controlling natural resources. There's a lot of things that he says that I agree with, but I think that when you get caught up in that world, there are some very clear sort of behavior patterns that you have to subscribe to. And this Islamophobia label is one. You want to avoid all fucking

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       costs. If you get hit with that one, that's a heavy one today. So heavy one and this politically charged world, you know, I mean, I made this point on a show recently that, you know, in the West, uh, the Islam narrative doesn't yet have the power to literally be had people. I mean, if, if you say some really nasty stuff against Islam and the Middle East, what we can solve that problem easily, we get rid of you. But in the west, what you could do is you could be head somebody's reputation, right? I mean them and metaphorical beheading. And that's what happens to guys like Sam Harris and Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Uh, unfortunately, uh, you know, this, I've never really faced this kind of blowback. Uh, maybe because I'm somewhat more measured in how I speak, I'm not exactly sure why you're also talking about your personal income, uh, which gives you more authenticity whereas Sam is viewed as some white guy who's speaking from a fucking cracker.

Speaker 3:          01:56:38       Exactly. Uh, but I mean, that's really what you see there are all these guys. I don't know if you know about them, I won't even mention them. So I don't give them any, any airplay that go around pretty much blaming everything on. So called new atheists. So. Right. Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris Are these sort of evil patriarchs before he died just before that. And you and use the fourth horseman. There's another Daniel Dennett dude. Yeah. He said, are you joking? Are you being serious? I don't know. Yeah, he's a, he's a philosopher at a school in Boston actually, but maybe brandeis, I'm not exactly sure. One of those schools. Uh, but anyways, uh, they go around just smearing these guys, their hate mongers. They're evil. A lot of gravity attached to that. Exactly. And, and now people who want to come into the discussion have to really think hard whether they want to be exposed to this kind of blowback.

Speaker 3:          01:57:34       And so you get self censorship, right? Yes. I mean I've had, and I don't think I've shared this story ever again, so double happy birthday. So I've had my wife, so I opened up my laptop and I start typing something and she'll come around nervously looking at what I'm typing. I say, well, what? Why are you hovering over me? And she said, and I mean this, this should give chills to anybody listening to this. Just like, remember we have two children. Oh God. Right now I'm thinking in the 21st century a professor in Canada now, even if my wife, my wife, we're paranoid. Even if she's overestimating the threat of the risk, the fact that she has the, reflects the intuition to actually engage in that behavior, to have those thought patterns, as you said, is, is really demonstrating that the canaries singing in the proverbial coal mine and it's not pretty right now. I have two choices. At that point. I could either tweet whatever it is I was tweeting, right, or I could say, yeah, you know, she might be right, let me engage in self censorship and every time that someone who otherwise

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       would be weighing in on the conversation engage in self censorship, the other side winds, and that's where we're at now. So to answer your question, how do we resolve this issue? Hopefully people grow a pair a and start weighing in on the matter. Well, it wasn't that one of the arguments about publishing the images from Charlie Hebdo that no one wanted to do exactly that. Astonishing these people lost their lives and the fight of a fundamental right, the foundational bedrock of all our freedoms is freedom of speech. They lost their lives defending that and every single western media coward and decided not to show it in every single one. I mean pretty much every single one. Yeah. Every single magazines. I mean New York Times didn't last treats titled in the time did it. I mean, nobody did. Right? As a matter of fact, there's one guy as relevant and Canada who, who published the original in 2006 and he was taken to a hate speech tribunal in Canada.

Speaker 2:          01:59:43       Right. I mean, think about it. How or William is that a guy could be taken to a hate speech tribunal for publishing these cartoons. It's astonishing is supposedly the cartoons are offensive. I've seen some of the cartoons and I just thought they were kind of stupid, you know, they seem a little on the racist side, some of them, but the idea that these kids get you fucking killed. Do you want me to show you the cartoons that are published every day in the Middle East media about Jews couldn't have managed care, so you know what I mean? Now the reality is we should all try to get along. We should all be respectful of one another. You shouldn't go out of your way to harm other people's feelings, but when it comes to testing the boundaries of freedom of speech, there should be no boundaries that can't be crossed.

Speaker 2:          02:00:30       Yeah, there should be. There should be. There should be no boundaries. It should be okay, I mean, I agree with you, but when the, when these things come up where your life is at stake, like your wife hanging over your shoulder saying, remember we have children and these people that have no time magazine, that Own New York Times, Los Angeles Times, they think about publishing these things and they just back off. They back off. They have families, they have lives. They don't want to be the sacrificial lamb. They have to put a name to those articles and they publish them and they know that the editor knows, the publisher knows. They all know that someone's going to find out who they are. And that's crazy, right? Look, I understand that pragmatism, but, but we all have to weigh in, in some form or another. And they failed. They failed, they failed. They failed. Free speech. Took a big blow to the Charlie Hebdo. I don't know if you know this. Now here's the kicker. You want to talk about Chutzpah, right? Sure. So, uh, one of, I can't remember the organization, one of the sort of Islamic organizations in the US gave an Islamophobia award to the slain Charlie Hebdo folks.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       So not only the dose people die for drawing cartoons, they were, they were smeared post mortem. I mean it's, it's, it's a level of diabolical grotesqueness that's unimaginable, right? I mean let, let them, at least in piece, right? So this is a real big battle of ideas and we all have to weigh in on it

Speaker 1:          02:02:05       and I think that there's a lot of folks that do not want to die like that and they also don't want to be confused with those folks that were drawing these cartoons. They don't want to be lumped in in any way, shape or form. So they will come out against it. Allah, Ben Affleck in very strong fashion. They will let everyone know that they are not on that team. Yes, they do think it's racist without any consideration whatsoever for the, the, the overall effect of those words of, of calling something like that. Islamophobic or what is Islamophobic? What you're talking about, a fear of an ideology that is so rigid, they'll kill you for a cartoon that doesn't scare you. You're not phobic of that. It seems to me, and I'm not saying you shouldn't be Muslim, it should be whatever the fuck you want, but as soon as it comes down to killing people over cartoons, we have a very weird problem on our hands. Right? And when we're dealing with an entire chunk of the western world that thinks that that's okay, that, that, that should be overlooked, but you can shit all over. Christians are shit all over. Mormons are shit all over anybody else. It's safe and it's okay. Well, book of Mormons, right? Think about the play. I mean,

Speaker 3:          02:03:18       people pay money to go and watch actors making fun openly about her religion. Try to do that with one particular religions. Try to do the book of Koran, right? Try that out. Right? So I mean, I don't know if you've heard the term bigotry of lowered expectations. Are there are different versions of bigotry, of softened expectations? The idea is that somehow Islam should not be held to the same standard as every other ideology because you know, they'll go crazy what? That that itself is racist, right? I mean, right. So when I gave you earlier the example of the Iraqi scientists who said that the earth is flat, right? And the, and the lady writes to me, well, why are you criticizing this guy? She's actually racist, right? Because she's saying that somehow this guy doesn't have the capacity to be criticized. Whereas when I criticize the rabbi that I went to visit, this is a true story. I was invited to a rabbi's House for Shabbat Dinner, Sabbath dinner, and as I entered the house, he introduces me to everybody and says, well, this a, this is a professor, blah, blah, blah. He studies evolution, but everybody knows that evolution has been falsified. So I'm not sure what he studies. Right? Well, that, that guy was being an idiot right now, how come when I criticize this rabbi, it's perfectly fair game. How come when I criticize the Republican senator who denies evolution because

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       of his Christian faith? Because he's a young earth creationist, that's perfectly fair, but if I criticize the Iraquis astronomer because he believes that the earth is flat, that's racist. Well, it's human folly. You know exactly what it is. I mean, we. We're in a very weird predicament with this one very large segment of our population on this planet. I mean, we're talking about a billion people. One point six, one point six point six. That's a large chunk. God Damn. That's a lot of fucking people. Now Do, do, do you see, how do you see the trajectories of Alpha brand? Do you see this ever the pendulum swinging the other way? What would you, what do you think would be the catalyst to redress some of this ground folly at go ahead. Psychedelic drugs for real thing that's going to work. They need to talk to the real God.

Speaker 2:          02:05:29       Have a real conversation with homeboy, right? And the. And the only way to get to him is through psychedelic drugs. I think that's the best way. Okay. It gets your rice, almond atheist, because I've never taken a psychiatric drugs. Psychedelics. That was the kind of thing you never. Here's, here's something. I've never taken any drugs. I've never smoked a single cigarette in my life. Wow. Mike, what about you get drunk? Very, very rarely. As a matter of fact, the first time I ever drank, I used to be a very competitive soccer player. I was maybe 22. I had very long hair. Very proud of my son Sonia and hair. A bunch of soccer players on my team held me down, brought scissors, put out your hair and they said you either drink today or the hairs off. That was the first time I ever drank.

Speaker 2:          02:06:16       I must've been 21, 22. So. So my only vice has been maybe my a dietary choices, but you still drink occasionally. Occasionally we'll. That's a drug, right? So how can you say you don't do drugs? You know what I mean, but I don't come on. That's just as as much of a blinder is religion is the idea that you don't perturb your consciousness through a very distinct method. Right. I have a glass of wine and get fucked up. You throw them back, you get crazy smashed glasses inside the chimney. If my wife is watching right now, she does have a photo of me drunk on a absence. No, no. We were at Club Med and I had drank too much and I'm totally sloshed. So that photo exists somewhere, so maybe she'll just club med. So maybe this bastard, right? Right. To her. Maybe she'll release it on twitter. Um, there's, I think there's certain psychedelic drugs that could help people, uh, alter their perceptions of this world and give you a reset. And that's what they do. I mean, I think is a very long conversation that I've had many, many times on this podcast and we could have it some other time maybe if you would like to off air or whatever, but there are, there are psychedelic drugs that are most likely the of all religious

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       experiences. In fact, there's a scholar out of Jerusalem. I'm pretty famous guy. I forget the argument, but what he's essentially saying is that the burning Bush that Moses described was most likely the acacia tree or the Acacia Bush, which is very rich dimethyltryptamine, which is the most potent psychedelic drug known to man. And I've experienced this particular drug and this particular drug gives you a very intense feeling of joining with the mother, with communicating with God, with, with, with getting in contact with some intelligent power, some intelligent mind, something that is above and beyond what exists in our normal dimension that we exist in and it's filled with complex geometric patterns and communicate with you telepathically. It is a very, very crazy experience. And one of the things that happens in these dmt trips is that they give you like lessons of how to live life. And the lessons all seem to row there.

Speaker 1:          02:08:45       You never have like these psychedelic dmt trip. So they tell you what you need to do is rape more and beat the fuck out of people and steal as much shit as you can. It's more like love, like love people. Love you, love the love yourself, love everyone around you because don't worry about all the bullshit, just being nice to each other. Just have fun. Just enjoy it. Spread it and don't lie. Don't lie, don't deceive, don't deceive yourself, don't deceive anyone else and don't, don't lose perspective. You're going to be here and then you're going to be there and you're going to be here and you're going to be there and it's going to go on and on and on. It's this perpetual cycle that continues from birth to death through infinity infant testimony. Part of an endless cycle, and this is the experience in a nutshell.

Speaker 1:          02:09:32       This is what you get out of it and very similar to the idea that you would come out of this experience with a set of tenants, set of rules like most this commandment. Sure. It totally makes sense that Moses could be this guy who was into smoking dmt and telling people, look, we're fucking up. We're having all these sword fights and shooting arrows at each other and poisoning our neighbors threats from a Jewish extremists though I doubt it because this guy in Israel, I know you are, but this guy in Israel Sivia find a and find that article, but it was a pretty interesting paper because this is a, you know, a real academic who is basing this on years of research. Well, isn't it the case that many religious rituals of various cultures engage in these types of consumer authority behaviors? We absolutely, as part of their religious rituals, correct wasn't matter of fact, John Marco Allegro, who is one of the main, um, scholars that was assigned to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is the oldest version of the Bible known right.

Speaker 1:          02:10:31       Um, and also I the only version in Aramaic, it was found in these clay pots and Qumran in 1940 something. It took forever for them to decipher these things. And this Guy John Marco Allegro, worked on them for 14 plus years and he was the only agnostic on the committee that was assigned to decipher it. He was originally an ordained minister. And over time he became disenchanted with the idea of religion when they found all these contradictions and religion and these comparisons to other texts. And he realized that a lot of it's probably bullshit. And so he wrote a book called the sacred mushroom and the cross. And after 14 years of deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls, it was his interpretation that the entire Christian religion was a massive misunderstanding that what it was originally about was the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and fertility rituals. Wow. And that it was a fertility cult because back then it was all about.

Speaker 1:          02:11:28       It wasn't about birth control, it was about get pregnant because there's not many of us. We need more and the Romans might becoming and in my fucking kill everybody, women need warriors. We're going to need a large group of us and we can't let them know about these mushrooms. And he even traced the Etymology of the word Christ to an ancient Sumerian word that meant a mushroom covered in God's semen and what, what they, what they thought was, according to John Marco Allegro, what they thought was that when it rained, that was god coming on the world, Kinda like a cosmic cosmic money shot. And that these mushrooms would grow out of the ground. Like, you know how it is when you have a rain and then you go outside in the morning, you see mushrooms that are already grown, like they weren't even there last night and now they're there.

Speaker 1:          02:12:17       They grow so quickly and then you would find these and they would eat these and have these intense psychedelic experiences of course. And so if you. Okay, hold on, sorry. So we'll leave it up. Leave it up so that these people that would experience these would have these intense transformative trips and without any science, without any knowledge of what the components of these mushrooms are, which is very similar by the way to human neurochemistry. DMT is nn dimethyltryptamine and that exists in the human brain. It's produced by the liver and the lungs. And they have now have proven due to this guy, Dr Rick strassman's work. He wrote this great book called Dmt the spirit molecule. He's a professor at the University of New Mexico and Got Dea approved clinical track tests on subjects using dmt. And, uh, this cottonwood research foundation that he helped start, has proven that it's produced in the pineal gland of live rats and the, what? The pineal gland is the third eye. It's in reptile that actually has let a retina and the Lens, I mean, it literally is in the center of the brain where the third eye is in eastern mysticism. It's producing this intense psychedelic drug.

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       And that's what this Hebrew University researcher Moses was tripping at Mount Sinai is, I mean, is he high? Obviously they'll know this literature is he viewed it as a sort of outlier, quack. You would have to research it and find out more about it because I did a cursory examination because I'm so familiar with the drug and it only makes sense to me. Um, this is, uh, he visited the Amazon and drink Iowasca and uh, he has this idea of that, that is what this was probably all about because Iowasca has been, they believe it's very difficult to find out what, when the, uh, the Amazonian indigenous people were drinking this brew. But IOWASCA is a form of DMT and much like the acacia bushes, very rich and dmt thousands of plants or Richmond Dmt, DMT, existence. Lance. Sorry. But what they're doing with this Iowasca is an orally active version of dmt because it has, um, it has one plant that has dmt in another plant that has something called an Mao inhibitor because dmt is broken down the gut by something called Mano Amy, not oxidase.

Speaker 2:          02:14:37       Cool. A Gino. This ritual, one of the Amazonian tribes. I discussed this, one of my books with the bullet ants. Are you familiar this? Yeah. Incredible. I mean for mean just mentioned briefly for your viewers who might not know it because I think they drink some psychotropic. Yeah, I think they do. I think it might be a tumor or something. One of those. There's a bunch of different crazy psychedelic drugs that they take down there. But apparently. So they, they basically have to. They, they sedate these bullets pants. And then they were these smoke, right? Which spoke. And then they wear these gloves were they then sort of weave the ants into the glove as the ants come out of their stupor, they start biting the wearer. Now, one bite from that ad, I mean it's called bullet pad because the pain is greater than if you were hit by a bullet.

Speaker 2:          02:15:30       Apparently it's the highest, you know, pain and do same thing in nature and they have to do it 20 times on different occasions before there's sort of accepted into manhood or whatever, the gds. But, but I mean, the, the point that, the link to your story is that I think they're under some psychotropics. Uh, yeah. Here it is. Those admits. My friend Steve was bitten by a bullet ant. Really? Bolivia. Yeah. He got bitten on his heel. He said it was unbelievably painful. They said it lasted for hours too, he said, but he said when it was over, it was really weird. It was so painful that he was delusional and he couldn't even remember which he'll got bit crafter. It was over because once it subsided it was like he like woke up from a transfer credit and he said it was really, really painful. That's really difficult to concentrate on anything. This slightly less spiritual. Can we segue from the money shots to an actual study on money shots on sperm? Yes. Yes, and I at the reason why I thought about this, because I know that in your own

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       Scada, fucking one track mind because I know that by the way, thank you very much for inviting me to your show in Montreal and to the the UFC. That was really fun. I'm glad you had a good time. And so when, when I was at your show with my wife, I think you had a little bit on sperm. I can't remember what it was. I'm sure I did. Yeah. Anyways, I think I might've sent you a direct message that kind of spoke to some of the issues that you raised. So here we go. Let's talk about the science of sperm and porn. Get ready. Yes. So this was a study done a few years ago by some colleagues of mine where they wanted to look at the content of porno movies. So if you think of the typical male fantasy at men who wants to have sex with many women, right?

Speaker 3:          02:17:13       So most societies are polygynous, meaning one man with multiple women, right? That's how it should be. God dammit to hell. Most societies, most societies, 85 percent of societies, uh, have historically condoned polygyny. Oh, what the fuck. By the way, people wrongly say polygamy. Polygamy just means one with many. But polygyny is one man with many women. Polyandry is one woman with many men. So, so stay with. That's horseshit. They are very, very. There are very few societies that have that. I've been telling everybody that's Jamie because of paternity uncertainty about, oh, of course. Right? So here it goes. So, so polygyny is what men want. One, basically, heroin building, one man with many women. Yet, if you do a content analysis of porn movies, what you find that that study has been done by a guy by the name athlete, Nicholas Pound, uh, that, that's a shout out to this guy.

Speaker 3:          02:18:12       He owes me now. So he did a content analysis where he showed that polyandrous depictions are much more common and porn movies, meaning one woman with multiple men, right? Okay. And so these. And he argued basically that the reason for that is because it's, it's an excitatory q for sperm competition. Okay. So watch this now. Uh, so then these other researchers came along and said, well, how could we test this? So what they did is basically they, they asked men to take one of two images home either with women having sex or one woman with multiple guys, polyandry, and then masturbate to those images and then bring back their sperm to the lab to be evaluated, or as I like to say, the fruits of their manual labor and the guests. What they found that the sperm that originated from the masturbations to polyandrous images were much more, had greater motility.

Speaker 3:          02:19:12       In other words, they were more vigorous, they moved a lot more which supported the idea of sperm competition, and this is exactly what you get an animal husbandry right when you want your stud to be riled up to have sex, you often will show another male having sex with a female and then this will get a rise out of him. So this explains the, if you like, the disconnect between how come men are so desirous to have sex with many women at once and yet you will, and then that's what you would think would be the picture. That informal reason, that's not what you get. You get a lot more of two, three guys on one woman, so now I have elucidated the mysteries of porn for you.

Speaker 1:          02:19:49       That makes sense on a biological level because the more promiscuous the females are around, man, the larger their testicles are testing language, right? The testicles grow and they produce more sperm because of the competition.

Speaker 3:          02:20:04       As a matter of fact. So that. Let me jump on that. So if you look across primates at the size of the testicle, of the males of that species as a function of female promiscuity and that species, you see a perfect correlation. So mountain gorillas, little tiny balls, little tiny Dick. Very good, right? They're usually impressive, but they have a complete sexual territoriality. Yeah, they fucked up. They became too powerful. Chimps on the other hand, massive testicle. They're walking testicles basically, right? Precisely because it's an adaptation to female promiscuity. Within that species. Humans are closer to the chimp. End of the scale for care. We are now speaking about the thought police, right? And all this bs stuff that you see on campuses when I describe those particular studies, the feminists and the crowd will be very, very pleased because then I'm demonstrating that women can be promiscuous, that fits the narrative of feminism.

Speaker 3:          02:21:03       If on the other hand, uh, I might five minutes later say, yeah, but when it comes to a, uh, sexual variety, men have a slightly greater pension for sexual variety than women, then I suddenly become Dr Mengele, the Nazi doctor. So, so basically the evolutionary finding that I discuss is either liberating to the feminist if it fits with the narrative or it is a form of patriarchal, sexist, bs if it doesn't fit bit, and that again is the problem with what you see on campuses, right? Rather than an open, honest, this course about the veracity of scientific findings, we judge these findings as a function of our pet ideology,

Speaker 1:          02:21:44       the pet ideology when it comes to gender identification and gender identities. I think that that's. There's a real interesting point to be made with that when it comes to science too, because one of the things that's always being touted about is diversity in science and gender diversity in science. But when it comes to what people actually want to do, there's been studies. You give a boy a certain toy or girls certain toy, they're going to gravitate towards things that are more in line with their gender. That's that fucks people up. They don't want to hear that. That some boys like trucks and some girls like dolls. But what it should be is what do they like and guess what if the girl likes trucks, are the boys liked dolls? Who a fuck,

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       but let's let the data speak for itself. Let's try to understand. I'm so happy you mentioned toy preference because that's one of my favorite examples to demonstrate the lunacy of the whole social constructivist stuff. So here we go. Okay. So usually in the social sciences or certainly social constructive as the ones who argue that everything is due to stress litigation will use toy preferences as if you like the starting point of how gender role socialization happens, right? Johnny is taught to play rough with the GI. Joe then start to play nurturing with the pink doll and that starts the cascade of arbitrary sexist, gender role socialization. So I decided that I wanted to take that premise on and I wanted to bring data from a very, very broad range of fields to completely dismantled this bullshit. Okay. So here we go. So if you take children who are in the pre socialization stage of their cognitive development, meaning that they don't yet have the capacity to be socialized and you give them tests, let's say, of eye gazing, they could either stare at adults or trucks or play with dolls or trucks.

Speaker 3:          02:23:26       Then you already see the sex specificity, other toy preferences and the priests socialization stage of their cognitive development, meaning they couldn't have been socialized into those preferences. Let's keep going. If you take other species, you take vervet monkeys and rhesus monkeys and you take infants of those species. It replicates the sex specificity of toy preferences of human infants. Let's go on. If you take, if you take a little girls who suffer from something called an endocrinological disorder called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This is a disorder that masculinize as little girls and masculinize as their morphology, their, their, their, their physical traits, but it also masculinized as their behaviors. Guess what happens to their toy preferences? They become more like little boy if you take. If you go to Sweden, which is the, the, the most gender neutral country in the world. Actually it's been studied as an iphone.

Speaker 3:          02:24:20       Yeah, gender neutral household. So in other words, basically what happens in Sweden is that the government has systematically tried to completely eradicate as a big social experiment. Any gender markers, you remove the gender pronouns, gender Pronoun, gender, gendered pronouns. That's right. That's right. I mean, I don't speak Swedish, but that's what I hear and there's. There's a scale that that's developed by a gentleman called hoffstead where he, where he ranks the countries from around the world on this gender score and Sweden is off the chart on it's femininity. Okay. It's just outrageous. And so if you now go to that country and study, it's a perfect field experiment, right? Because they've spent 40 years trying to eradicate arbitrary sexist, gender stereotypes and therefore you should see that maybe the toy preferences would now be no longer like everywhere else. Guess what you find in those countries, it's exactly the same as anywhere else. If you go to 3000 years ago to funerary ice

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       icon, fear near funerary monuments where little children are depicted in ancient Greece and you and you study how the children are depicted, the little boys are shown with wheels and trucks and so on, the little on our trucks, but the wheelbarrow stuff and the girls are shown with dolls. You could study cultures in various areas of Africa. Indigenous cultures as has been done by a French anthropologist and the exact same behaviors manifest themselves so and that just shows you how long we've been under the oppressive thumb of the historical. Very good at it. That's what it is. She archi, exact mass media has been around even before then, but how do we explain this written and clay tablets? They were bullshitting even back then. Men are assholes. Either way. This this. You know what the to the to the digit ratio is. Are you familiar with that?

Speaker 2:          02:26:11       Yes. Yes. Please explain so that the two D, four d is the is the length of the ratio of your index finger to your ring finger and at as a sexually dimorphic trait, meaning that men have much longer ring fingers than than index fingers. Whereas women, the two fingers are roughly the same length. Why is this important to this discussion? Because that morphological feature is actually shaped in Utero as a function of how much testosterone you've been exposed to in utero. Okay. Therefore, what some researchers have done is they've looked at the digit ratio of little boys and then link that to their play pattern behaviors and again, what do you find? Little boys will have more masculinized. The ratios have more masculinized toy preferences. Same thing has been done by the way with actually circulating testosterone. You take seven day old children and until the six months old you measure their testosterone and testosterone level predicts toy preferences.

Speaker 2:          02:27:12       So look how many different disparate lines of evidence I've just come up with to demonstrate that it is not due to arbitrary, you know, sexist socialization. It's very uncomfortable for me that people want to ignore that and put this all on cultural ideas and stereotypes that people subscribe to because they don't want their child to be ostracized by the community. It's, it's, uh, it was very uncomfortable for me. It, it drives me nuts because I think it fucks people's heads up to us because then they feel like there's something wrong with them for liking masculine things. Right? And being masculine or liking masculine thing seems less and less of a favorable pursuit in 2015 and it's kind of I've ever been before. It's like men get kind of shit on in this society because we get blamed for a lot of things. And, and um, and I'm not saying poor men and women because I think being a man is pretty fucking bad ass. I like it, I enjoy it. But I just also don't think that we're necessarily evil either, right? I mean, if some men do evil shit, it doesn't mean that men are evil. And if boys like trucks or girls like dolls, it doesn't mean anything wrong with either one of them, but it is wrong. We try to ascribe

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       or prescribe it when we try to put that into some sort of an ideological box. Yes. And we dismiss it or we categorize it as being a part of the problem is with our culture when it's so clearly a natural thing.

Speaker 3:          02:28:40       Well, I, I think it stands this lunacy, and I'm not sure if we discussed it last time I was on the show, but this lunacy I think comes from a good place in a idiotic place. But the place it comes from the idea that if something is biological based, it's immutable and, and that's, that's a scary thing, right? So people talk about biological determinism, which is complete nonsense. And so the idea of an brain being empty. Slate. How, how's the biological determinism nonsense. How so? Because almost everything is a inextricable mix of your biology and environmental inputs. Uh, almost nothing that you could think of doesn't incorporate some environmental input into whoever you. So the idea of it being completely independent of any. Exactly. So the idea of nature versus nurture is really a silly mood dichotomy because it's a big broad spectrum of inputs.

Speaker 3:          02:29:32       Exactly. And so the example that I left the gift to drive that point home, some of your viewers might have heard me say before, it's the cake metaphor. So if you take a cake, you take all the ingredients of the cake. Here's the, here's the baking soda, here's The flower, here's the eggs here, the sugar. Once you Vegan cake, once you put it all together, right? You're unable to then point, once the cake is made, you can't point, show me where the eggs are showing, right? It's an x, it's an extra fuel mix. That's the idea of nature versus nurture. Makes no sense. We're this big challenge with this cake. Of course. Yeah. Uh, so, so I think it comes from the idea that it's biology is scary because it's somehow doesn't carry with a degrees of freedom. You know, if boys are supposed to be this and girls are supposed to be that, then we're doomed to those biological imperatives.

Speaker 3:          02:30:24       And again, that's not true. All of these phenomena fall on a bell curve, right? I mean, some people are more this way. Some people are more that way, so there's nothing really deterministic. Also, just another point, for example, men have a, uh, evolved desire to seek status. That's the biological imperative because women desire status and men, but now the way Joe and Gad go about instantiating that evolutionary imperative, it's completely different as a function of their idiosyncratic talents that shows you that it's not right. It's not that we, we both have to become comics and that's the only way to gain status. What is common to both of us is we both aspire to ascend the social hierarchy. That's the common biological imperative. How we go about it is completely determined based on your unique personhood. So again, there's nothing deterministic about it.

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       What do you think it is about the current climate where people want to ignore all these biological markers like you were talking about with children and gravitating towards certain toys and testosterone versus estrogen and babies. What do you think it is about people that want to avoid these things but ignore this data? Well, it's exactly that. It's the fact that it's very, very hopeful. Oh, the narrative is very hopeful to assume that we all start with equal potentiality with APP that makes us completely indistinguishable. That's a very hopeful message because it basically says that we are infinitely malleable. Right. You know, had joe had a different upbringing, maybe he would have been Michael Jordan. No, you wouldn't have been. Right. They are enabling a black guy. I was just saying about how good a basketball thing could be right there. They are unique, unique realities about the random combination of genes that made lionelle messy that makes it such that not withstanding the fact that he trains a lot, much harder than most other people.

Speaker 2:          02:32:25       He is endowed with unique talents that not every other kid would have been privy to those talents. I always bring that point up when I talk about Jon Jones hose that. John, how dare you. Oh sorry. Former UFC light heavyweight champion. It was one of the most talented fighters that's ever lived. A really tall, long reach, spectacular athletic ability and one the year he was the youngest ever UFC champion. Right. And just dominate which era. This era he beat Mauricio Shogun, who, uh, for the title and just destroyed him in his first title fight in the shoguns like famous world class. MMA fighters fought the best of the best throughout history. And what he, I always say, no matter how hard you train, you could. If you're just a regular dude, you're never going to be that guy. If he trains just as hard, you're fucked. Right. He's just very talented.

Speaker 2:          02:33:19       Very physically talented. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. There's where not created equal. We're just not just not. I mean Einstein. Ron, Jeremy's Dick. I haven't. I have. You have. I have not, not in person, but I've seen it in. There you go. As a 13 or 14 year old trying to sneak into good Lord. That is impressive. Yes. Can I also mentioned that he's Jewish? Just just to let you go look at that. By the way, that the Klan, by the way, by the way, if you look at, there's this a world atlas of being sizes that came out and I wish to engage in modesty, but you might want to check the scores of the Lebanese men just for giant. Just saying. I'm just saying congratulations. Congratulations on your people. Second place to black folks though, right there, there were up there.

Speaker 2:          02:34:07       They were out there. Know everyone starts out dates. Just patriarchy that women have bigger dicks than men. Right? Right. It's the patriarchy that makes their clitoris is smaller penises. Do you find. Do you think that there's going to become a time in our lifetimes at all ever wear this climate is going to adjust back? Is it going to take 100 years for just back to some sort of. I find that question so, so fascinating because I. it's hard for me to predict what the trajectory would be on the one hand and on my pessimistic day. I think that, you know, all, all great empires imploded from within. You've heard that, right? It's not that there's sort of this hordes of other folks that come in, it's it's, it's the empire that becomes cancerous within itself and it implodes. I think on my pessimistic days, I say, no, we're screwed.

Speaker 2:          02:34:54       This is just going to go on further and further until the whole west collapses in this grand lunacy that we're engaged in, but it's not the whole west. It's not everyone. There's a lot of people out there that, that aren't represented by this ideology, but not the intelligentsia who controlled the information. Right. They don't really control information anymore is my point. The Internet Internet information. That's true and it's not even the intelligentsia that's doing this. It's children. It's students that are scaring the fuck out of teacher. Right? I mean, that's really what it is. It's like Tumbler and facebook and these people that formed these insulated groups where there their echo chambers and they, you know, they believe that this is reality and they, they, they want to yell at it. Bernie Sanders, black lives matter, and then they get the fucking mic, which is even crazier. They let those kids who screamed and yelled, they let them talk and incredible.

Speaker 2:          02:35:48       Just like that's the worst fucking message to send. By the way. We will let you have the mic. We will let you have to stop screaming at him. So what's. Why are you more optimistic? Do you think that will be? Yes, yes. I think that how would it work? Because kids today are growing up, listening to conversations like this and realizing how retarded these 20 year olds are and that they're going, I want to be that when I get older I want to look at things for what they really are and I think that as they get to that position, this, this new crop will have grown up and come out of this dark hole that is the clan that grew up with social media. They grew up in these, these groups with massive confirmation bias. Right? And this confirmation bias I think is kind of in these certain ways is kind of dangerous.

Speaker 2:          02:36:34       You know, I mean not to blow smoke up your proverbial behind on your birthday, but one of the wonderful things in the last year has been to appear on your show precisely because I've seen the reach that you have just in terms of how people have responded to my work. Right. I mean most scientists will toil in their respective disciplines. I mean hopefully they do good stuff, but the number of people that they ultimately are communicating with as if it was a very restrained small number. Right. But by coming on these types of shows, that's why I think we were talking earlier about, you know, coming out of your shell, engaging in the public discourse, weighing in on these issues. I always a debate some of my colleagues, many of whom are very much in the ivory tower, right. We only communicate with other members of the clergy, right.

Speaker 2:          02:37:21       With other members of our restricted the class of high brow. And I think that that's not really what the job of a professor is. I mean, that's part of the job we have to create knowledge and communicated to other academics, but if we're good academics, if we're good men have ideas, we also have to be engaging the public. Right? I mean ultimately the public also pays for my salary through also. That's how information really gets spreaded. It doesn't get spread by bouncing it around amongst each other, like a little beach ball at a concert. Exactly. Gets spread by getting it out there into the great channel of the Internet. Exactly, so the number of people that have heard of my evolutionary psychology work as applied to consumer behavior and so on through just having been on your show is it will probably take me 10 careers before I could reach as many people through some other forum and so I agree with you in that sense that these types of forums are profoundly important.

Speaker 2:          02:38:14       I only wish that more academics would actually have the courage to start coming on these types as well. It's very dangerous for them financially independent and these and these environments that we have today. I mean, you could cherry pick a million things that are said in this show and take them out of context and paint me out to be some sort of a monster. True. That's just the nature of having a conversation with someone where you joking around. Whereas if you take it and put it in quotes in print and you take something out of the context of the conversation and put it in print and you could have. You can infer all sorts of different ways that this person is trying to communicate. That could be construed as being offensive and then it gets. It gets gross. The difference between back then and now is now you could always just go on a podcast and talk about.

Speaker 2:          02:39:02       You could always write a facebook blog and explain yourself in great detail with no editorial input whatsoever. No one can come along and take away from it. Or you know, I've talked to many people that have written things and then had those things. Even publishing online magazines has those things heavily edited and chopped up and even had words put in their mouth. I had a dispute with this journalist and we were talking about something and, well, why did you save that? And she goes, I didn't say that. Wow, the editor put that in there. I go, you're kidding me. They can do that. And she goes, yeah, they add things to it. I know that's fucking insane. I've experienced something similar to that on several occasions. So one time a guy called me when my book came out, the book has pornography and it's titled the consuming instinct and it's subtitle and he really. I mean, the key point he wanted to get to was that professor sad argues that there is a gene for porn, which of course I'm not at all arguing that. So I kept repeatedly explaining to him that to explain the evolutionary basis of why men might enjoy porn doesn't suggest that there's a set of genes in your genome that you know, that cold for porn preferences. I explained. So please don't.

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       Next day you know exactly what he wanted to course. Uh, but you just learn to. That's part of the beast. They don't care. They're not trying to be honest. Yeah. It's not intellectual honesty. What it is is they're trying to get clicks to trying to get people to pay attention to it and that's what they do and they can do it for now, but this is a transitionary time between this time that we're at now where there is still this a bit of cloudiness, right? There's a bit of fog in the air of information, you know, it's just sometimes it's hard to find out exactly what the fuck is going on, but that fog is very, very close to being lifted and sheer intent I think will be displayed. It will be a part of discourse in a way that I don't think has existed before in the near future.

Speaker 1:          02:40:56       Right. I think you're going to be able to know a lot more about what someone's trying to portray just in the next decade or so than we've ever known in the past. And also the transparency like that you have like the transparency that not just in your words and how you, uh, you are able to communicate and describe things, but also in how you're able to defend those things. If something comes up that just didn't exist before, he had no recourse if somebody misquoted you or an eye. I've had that happen before a long time ago and like 99, this woman wrote an article about my show or one of my cds. She did a review of my cd and not just took me out of context, but completely misquoted me and changed the words of my bits to make them horrible and I had a conversation on the phone with her, with my publicist.

Speaker 1:          02:41:47       I'm like, why didn't you do that? And she's like, well, that's what I heard when I heard your work. I go, that's what you heard. That's what you heard. I go, well, that's not what I wrote, but that's not what I said. It's not what I wrote. And so you lied. I go, you're a fucking liar. Like, well, you're not a journalist, you're a liar. And she thought I left the phone. She started. I left and hung up because I just, I go, well, we're done talking then. Great. And so she goes, she. There was a pause and so she says, the publishers, your, your client is losing it. And I go, I'm not losing it. You're a fucking liar. Do you not understand what happened here? So I wrote a story about her in my blog about, um, just I called yellow journalism. I think it was the title of it, about how ridiculous she was.

Speaker 1:          02:42:33       And it was the first time that anybody could ever do something like that. Right? In the old days you would have to get it printed somewhere, you know, to get it printed in a magazine. Good luck writing, uh, an article about how um, you know, you wanted to love someone because they were so full of shit. I forget what I said. I was just trying to be ridiculous. I was trying to upset her, right. You know, but that used to be what they could do, you know, that some guy could listen to you talk about genes and pornography and how men could be more attracted to pornography and go, oh, I know how to make this fucking salacious. I know how to make that guy look like an asshole. I'm just going to say, this professor thinks there's a gene for they're prints and done. What can he do?

Speaker 1:          02:43:16       Well, what can he do? What's his name? What's that guy's name? Oh, I don't remember. And will fight for. I could probably find that out. We know what you did. That's right. You know, you did too. You can't, you know. But I mean you've had a platform because of, you know, being an entertainment. But I'm, I'm amazed by guys who start youtube channels. I recently appeared on a, on a youtube channel that Scott, he calls himself Sargon of awkward. He, I mean he's, he's a nobody in the sense of not having come from, you know, an acting world or not being a public figure, but this guy is brilliant. He now has over 150,000 youtube subscribers, maybe 25, $30 million viewers. Beautiful. Right? And that's based on merit and start, right? This guy would never have had a voice. What were it? Not for the, the, the mediums that we are now afforded to us.

Speaker 1:          02:44:04       And so that's why I just, I feel like a kid in a candy store to appear on all these shows because it offers me a voice to spread means, right. I mean I consider my job as a meme creator mean propagator. And so any way that I can do that, including coming on, you know, this brilliant podcast, I consider myself unbelievably fortunate and I don't see why other academics don't see the value in death. Well I think they will eventually in some do. I mean I have, I've had quite a few on now, but I think that what we're dealing with is a new thing we're dealing with is this completely new pathway to for information to travel and it has to be kind of recognized and accept and it's slowly being done. So like there's a sign in front of the comedy store and one of the hotels, like, you know, they paint the side, like a billboard on the entire side of the hotel and it's a youtube channel that has millions of subscribers.

Speaker 1:          02:44:51       So this woman's Youtube Channel, I've never heard of her before, but she's got millions of subscribers and there's a few of those that youtube has put up all around the city and what they're getting for each individual video that they put out is very similar to what a hit cable show gets. And that's reality and you can't fuck with that. Those are real numbers and real people that are the same kind of people that watch television and it's just a new pathway for information. It just makes it harder for people to lie and bullshit. And like that guy who wrote that article, he's just lazy, he's lazy and just work sucks and his mind's week. And so he wants to come up with some way that he can turn something in, some click baity bullshit article. So that's what he does. He distorts reality to fit his own agenda and for his own game.

Speaker 1:          02:45:34       And uh, and he does so in a way that he doesn't care for damages you because he has power over you. Right? He doesn't have any power over you anymore. No one does. No one has any power of anyone and this whatever of mart or wherever the fuck the guy's name was. I'm sorry I'm putting, he's going to get millions of good friends, but this guy, he got there based on merit, you know, and there's a lot of those guys out there now and they cover a wide variety of topics to whether it's sports, there's martial arts commentators that have done that. There's, there's people that do that about technology. It's just we live in a beautiful time to 174,000 followers. I mean, I know it's nothing but that's. I mean that's what was on television though. He's on Fox all the time and he's a legit journalist for May, but yeah, it's beautiful.

Speaker 1:          02:46:23       And. But he started out on the Internet as well. We live in a beautiful time. We do. Speaking of time gotta wrap this bitch. Oh Nice. Do we do any promotional stuff? Do you want to. What do you want to do? Just a could follow me on twitter at God. Sad, she had a d, they could go to my youtube channel which has got side again, and he had a great youtube channel. By the way, will you sit down, you talk about a lot of things and you do speak on, edited in front of the camera and express yourself. It's a wonderful way that, and you can follow me on my public page. Glorious. Let's do this again, my friend anytime. Thank you, sir. Thanks for being here my birthday. All Right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back tomorrow. Until then, enjoy your life. Bye. Bye.
