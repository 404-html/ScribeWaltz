Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches, fascinating about the liquid around them out anyway, but I suppose people that are signed totally, she would say this is our religion and uh, you're, you're taking the piss out of our religion.

Speaker 2:          00:12          It's an ideology that is also a very positive one in the sense that it's dedicated towards self improvement and eliminating all these psychological barriers that are holding you back and in that way. But people find a lot of benefit in being a part of that religion. And I think when they find a lot of benefit in being a part of it, then you know, they could justify all the other nonsense and just sort of ignore it. Because what l Ron Hubbard, according to the going clear book, uh, Lawrence Krauss book was trying to do with self medicate would, he had a lot of psychological issues himself and he was trying to cure his own issues and in using these methods to cure his own religion or the zone, his own issues, he translated them into a religion. Like this is a big part of what scientology initially was, was his own attempts to self diagnose and treat his own psychological ailments.

Speaker 1:          01:03          A good idea really works really well and there are so I suppose people that it's working for. I like a quote, I heard that I'd like to be quick to see where religious people are. Right. You know, it's all really obvious where religious people are wrong. You know, cause we sort of hear about it on the news but like where religious people to write, you know, sort of togetherness, selfless nurse relationship with a deepest self acceptance of death and the possibility of transcendence of the human primal self. Those things are all really beautiful ideas. They've kind of lost their way in a science as scientists, you know that term scientism, the idea that sort of science has got into territories that science company handled because we come to a judge during full stop at certain points. You know like what happened on the Tuesday before the Big Bang, you know, materialism, materialism, individualism are hard things to overcome.

Speaker 1:          01:56          If like if, if people, if we are, if we have as our dominant mindset, I'm only going to believe shit that I can prove. Then you are just an individual and you may as well just, you know, why not just spend your life fucking as many people as you can and accumulating as much material as you can because nothing exists unless you can see it, measure it, way it, contain it and fuck it. You know, if that is the dominant belief system, which we sort of materialism, consumerism, capitalism, I think all dovetail on that premise. You know, this is all, it's real fucked. You know, that's how you can have that chronic ecological disrespect is because, oh, it doesn't matter what happens after you're dead. They'll be like, well, what about my fucking children? Even just on a practical level of God live on this fucking pebble in infinite space.

Speaker 1:          02:41          And they'd like, but if you're just like, well no, we've not really thought about that. And a sort of an inability to accept, you know, like certain, and I know that you're sort of like a, I don't wholesale by any dominant theory, but I think it's clear to me that, do you know what I believe in on an individual level and on a cultural level, if something is possible, you should be trying to fucking do it. So as soon as people realize, hold on a minute, that's having a negative impact or hey, this is a bit of a way of using our resources. Now utilities, as soon as you realize it, you should be moving towards it. They say wisdom is acting on knowledge. Why don't you even recognize our fossil fuels are running out? Is that right? Fucking it all. We'd better start working on the basis that we're fucked.

Speaker 1:          03:18          We better start looking at alternative energy stores is where look at different alliances. You just say like knowing those things and not doing them, it makes me very, very uneasy because it makes me think who benefits from ignoring this stuff? Who's running this show? If he's having all of that, you know, if it's creating all this rage, all this unease, all this fear in your country and in my country now times of great, great disease and uncertainty for people really looking for something and know that these institutions are just saying, just, you know, carry on. There's no sort of alternative. No one's going to let you know. No one now is going to see himself as part of a religious community in the same way or a sort of one of the dead ideologies of the last century, and meanwhile we're in this sort of peculiar state of looming crisis that feels kind of fucking mad.

Speaker 2:          04:05          Well, we're definitely in a state of looming crisis, but to unpack this whole thing, you started off with this idea of what happened the Tuesday before the Big Bang and how science can't really answer that. Well, they can't answer it yet. I did that. The problem is once they gather more data, it might be a hundred years now or a thousand years from now. They can say, Oh, well here we've done the calculations and we understand now that it's an infinite cycle of birth and death and the universe is constantly expanding and contracting. And this is the process that we're a part of. It's infinite and it's never started it, it's never ending. And it goes on and on and on.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Often you'll probably bloody right mate. I like that idea that you just espoused is in 5,000 year old fucking documents called the upanishads. Yeah. Those are like, those ideas are there already. So when we fucked off religion a hundred years ago, because it was causing too much, you know, our sake, we got, we kicked out of some of the items that are only now just being discovered, right.

Speaker 2:          04:57          These are just to be contemplated right now and to be considered where a science is trying to find definitive evidence that they do or don't represent the reality of our timeline. And once they do, then they'll be able to talk about it. But right now what they're doing is they're examining the evidence that the big bang exists and what could have possibly caused that.

Speaker 1:          05:14          Yeah. That, see what my difficulty is is that there are, that is when any ideology behaves dogmatically and prohibitively like previous like prevents further exploration, whatever would like what kind of, what's an example of the nature of consciousness? No one knows why consciousness impacts matter in the way it does in the sub quantum world. No, we can't fucking, we've come to a point he's like, oh fuck. Like you know like if you would like that, that the famous double slit theory that an observed particle behaves differently, like the end of the park on wave can change it as the central nature depending on where he's been obsessed represented

Speaker 2:          05:54          though when it's been explained to me by people actually understand it. What it really is is that we're measuring these particles and in the act of measuring you're changing the results. Yeah. Because you're using something to measure it.

Speaker 1:          06:07          Yes, yes.

Speaker 2:          06:09          Yeah. But it gets represented as all this woo woo craziness.

Speaker 1:          06:13          But what I think is interesting, Joe, is somewhere between this woowoo craziness and that kind of a flat, mundane, low. This is life. You're born, you die, you eat food, shit comes out your asshole territory. Somewhere in there is a mystery that they're behind your eyes buying Jimbo, Jamie's eyes and my eyes. There is a constant, there is this consciousness, there is this awareness. There's this inexplicably experience that you've add on dmt experiences that I've had through yoga and through lsd. That suggests to me that consciousness itself is the dominant force. Consciousness is not just one more phenomena is the seat of all phenomena and when people are saying, oh, there's this thing, that's God. What they are saying is there is an absolute consciousness and all is contained within it. All matter at some point has come from consciousness. These realms, they're experienced, true psychedelic or extreme extreme, you know, personal experiments like your cryogenic things or your flotation tanks all suggest a phenomenon beyond the individual consciousness.

Speaker 1:          07:16          They something else there and the very fact that it's in for the, the consciousness, even by the process of measuring, even by the process of measuring is influencing and impacting rally. I don't think that, you know, I'm not taking that to the extreme so I know what you mean. Make some people go, oh that means your mind can control shit. I'm going, I think it means that it means that reality is only reality when you look at it. That's when it's kind of getting towards a bloody good book that I reckon your listeners will be banging into is called buyer centuries in by a man called Robert Lanza who he did the best breakdown I've ever read of that double slit experiment and a and of the, the, the, the, you know, made me understand for the first time that reality is happening within your own consciousness.

Speaker 1:          07:56          It's not an external phenomena at all that, you know, like Hebrew explained in very ways that I could understand of like he went, you know, you sort of think, thinks I'm totally mundane. He went like, you know the experience of going in your kitchen in the night and turn in the light on. Is your kitchen fridge still there when you go back downstairs? He goes, well, I guess when you do go in your kitchen in turn the light on, he goes see a foa on parcels of photons come down, they'd interact with the optic nerve, they re trends low, they invert eating your consciousness. You Go, yeah. So whatever it is, it's in your kitchen. When you're not looking at it, it ain't the same as when you are looking at is an interpretive reality. And one of the ways that I've sort of reduced this down for my own simple understanding is this, that if none of us had a sense of smell, if you didn't, I then Jamie didn't.

Speaker 1:          08:38          And then well how would the concept of smell makes sense? How would you go up? There's paint, there's bacon with, none of us would have the instrument to receive it. So that whole thing would be off the agenda. So I think that there are streams of energy streams of data for which we do not have the instruments to receive. So we totally it because we simply don't have the instruments to receive it. And I said once it in most startup, as a matter of fact, like yeah, my cat doesn't know there's an internet. The internet does not enter the realm of my cats consciousness, but the fucking internet is out there. We're out here having with these fucking experiences and like all those realms that we're experiencing in these various sort of psychedelic states or you know, however they were achieved is an indication to me there's another reality now, where does that become fucking relevant to what we're talking about?

Speaker 1:          09:19          For me, where it does, he's one of the continual ideas that keeps remerge reemerging to connect us back to where we were with Joe Campbell at the beginning is there is this fucking sense of oneness and believing ourselves to be individual and believing that the dominant thing in our lives to be material that fucks us up because people will kill each other over that material. And once we sort of realized, no, we're, the true thing about us is the consciousness is the inner self. That's the roofing. They were all out here. We're all in the game. We're all going to do shit and we're all gonna make mistakes. But that's not have the material idea as the dominant social idea cause that everyone's agreed with that, whether they're communist or capitalist or fascist or whatever everyone's saying. Now the main thing is this shit this out here.

Speaker 1:          10:00          And it's like that connects to those primal drives. Cause we know that if that's happening in your sexual drive, you can never have enough pussy. If that gets into your status drive, you can never have enough space and power. You know, so like we're all going to still feel those things. I'm still going to be a 25 times a day, but it'd be nice if the cultural ambiance was, oh don't worry Russell, you'll be back to your normal self in a minute of feeling that we're all one and we're all connected, not, yeah. Well of course I feel like that and that's what frightens me about the culture of our countries at the moment is it's endorsing the worst aspects of our nature. It's a culturating the worst aspects of our nature instead of the best aspects of our nature. And that for me then no fucking difference between left and right in the current political sphere because they're all making the same argument. They were all saying come and live out here in the material world.

Speaker 2:          10:46          Yeah. It seems to me that the material world and this idea that we should be accumulating possessions and status and all these different things is universal. It almost seems like it's a natural progression from ancient tribal civilization life to this weird city life to this integration of electronics and our life in this symbiotic relationship that we have to computers and the Internet and information itself. It seems like this is one of the things that drives, that is this desire for material possessions because when you have a desire for material possessions and ensures that you're going to continue to innovate and come up with newer and greater and better because you always want to keep up with the Jones' is you always want to have the newest tesla cause it goes zero to 60 in two seconds and you want to have the coolest fucking house with the biggest TV and the fastest internet and all those things sort of compound this technological innovation cycle that we're on.

Speaker 2:          11:35          So my thought has been for a long time that what we are is some sort of electronic caterpillar that's going to give birth some artificial life and that all of our desire for material possessions and status and all these different things is really just us pushing for this electronic agenda and that this innovation and the construction of artificial intelligence that's inevitable is eventually going to be the next stage of life. And that word like huddling ourselves up in this sort of civilization cocoon and that boom, out of that cocoon is going to pop some sort of a god being and that this is what we're here for and this is what we've been doing since we're a monkey's flinging shit at each other and flipping over cow patties, looking for mushrooms, that we are a part of a process and then if you look at it objectively, all these traps that you or I or Tom Cruise or Jim breuer been caught up in when whether it's traps of ego or jealousy, all these things sort of ensure movement. They insure movement and ensure interactivity and that is going to ensure innovation and progress and competition and all those things that even we look at it, we go, this is so pointless. This is so foolish, but yet it's so incredibly prevalent. Not Glorifying it or saying it's definitely the way to go, but objectively, if you weren't a human and you're stepping outside of this thing, looking at it from a distance, you're like, these fuckers are making something. They might not even know they're making something.

Speaker 1:          12:54          That's they're making concern just hand out the same way that bees or ants may not be aware of their hive consciousness and that and the common drive. But where I disagree with you Joe, is that, that you see the end point as being the materialization of a superconsciousness through technology. I see the end point is being a realization amongst us as a species. Now I know that they're now, it could be both and there is no, you know, there is no reason to, uh, you know, we are just another fucking, are we just another species on this planet? Oh, we will know better than dogs and cows and monkeys. I don't, I, I, you know, how can, how certain we are, if the path, the very sun that heats us up has a lifespan. Yeah. Where are their inventions as well? The cats and the monkeys. There's, I'm fuck they invented being cute. I mean, they're the real darling in your lap. You pet them. They need to find contribution contributing cause the dog for a walk. You come up with good ideas, whereas smelly. That's fair. That's fair enough. I do love my dog bear, but hold on. Uh, but my, what was my, what was my point there? God

Speaker 2:          13:58          breaks. What you're saying is we should pump the brakes, we should pump the brakes of this possession and this, this idea that we're trying to accomplish these great things by accumulating things and status and it's all bullshit and it's really about consciousness more than anything.

Speaker 1:          14:11          In fact, Bill Hicks I think already said it when he said that, you know, that we, we can be explicit, we can explore space in a, an hour together and peace. Not that, that idea that if we look to our common drives, it's like into that hancock all the time. I've heard him on your show saying like that, you know, that what really what's happening is a bias towards a particular aspect of our own consciousness. The problem solving brain and like, you know, there's no, that those drives are amazing, but those jobs, they're trying to get somewhere. Technology is amazing. We were like, you know, at the very fact that people bloody here is, I don't understand any of it. It's fucking wonderful. But the dominant idea behind it, one of profit, that dominating idea and like in a profit in itself is not necessarily negative, but profit at all costs. [inaudible] costs. So like really, I'm not saying we should as a species fucking slow down and dressing felon fucking, you know, like Graham and vegetables, you know, funny. Now I want human beings to be glorious. But what I'm saying is that our bias towards this one particular I'm materialistic idea is preventing us from realizing that glory because part of our consciousness has been ignored.
