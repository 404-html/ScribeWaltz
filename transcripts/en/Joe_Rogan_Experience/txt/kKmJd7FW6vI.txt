Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello

Speaker 2:          00:01          Freak bitches, your head's not to get as opposed to get jostled around too much, but it goes every direction except it goes right except down. I have a buddy of mine who's a professor who's 49 or 50 and he kick boxes. He's bars and I'm like, but you know, you understand this like you're into this, you know, he's a history professor, like you understand that this is dangerous shoe brand, but you get so much enjoyment out of the thrill of being primal. You've actually been in their sparring.

Speaker 1:          00:32          Let me ask you a question. Did we, we didn't talk about this last time, that calcium storico thing in Italy once. Yes, bs. They bare knuckled football with bare knuckle boxing. Insane. Insane. So I was going to go make that documentary. Yes. And Berg I think ended up making it anyway, but we were like, just broken up. And I'm like, why am I making a documentary of my ex boyfriend? This is really self abusive, but it's apparently the, the month that it happens, violence in the area goes down. Of course. Yeah. So there's something interesting about these guys who want to go spar, like maybe they're sexually harassing less women at work, maybe they're having less bar fights. This calcium storico. So it was invented in the 16 hundreds to entertain kings. It was stopped because so many people were dying and then I want to say 1916, they brought it back. They keep it low profile because so many people get concussions and sick group kickboxing. I think 20 on 20 a the only rule is no two on one. These are grown men. These are not young like athletes. They're not professional athletes. They're butchers, they're lawyers, they're whatever. Exchange

Speaker 2:          01:40          partners. Like guys just moved, a new guy moved in, they just touched hands. Like one guy was duking it out with a guy and then for some reason they changed their knuckle. It's also

Speaker 1:          01:50          by region, so it's like neighborhoods against neighborhoods. So a lot of it's like fathers against sons, brothers against brothers,

Speaker 2:          01:56          the change teammates, like two guys were fighting and then another guy steps in and takes the place. First of all, these guys have dog shit skill,

Speaker 1:          02:06          but it's no, these are not a guy just stepped in. These professional athletes, these are literally guys that have other jobs once a year. They just agree to fucking just fight each other. It gets pretty far. Which one is this? What number minute are you in? Oh, well, okay. You should see the ball. It actually. The goal is to get the ball into the other side, but when you dog shit skills and so funny. I'm just allowing me that when the person's scores, they get this so hit so hard that no one wants to go like everyone's like, no, you do it. You do it because as soon as you score, people just pummel you and then you see these guys in the corners with stretchers. They just carry people off the field the entire time. So this guy is holding this guy down. So you could grapple to. Yes. The only rule you can bite. You can kick in the body. You can do anything. The only thing you can't do is to, on one, that's the only rule you can bite. The only rule is no two on one. You can kick in the balls. I'm sure. I mean maybe that's like a general,

Speaker 2:          03:10          like two guys are the only two guys that are humping will these two guys. This guy's got this guy's back and there's a lot of people fucking lolly gag. A lot of cherry pickers. They need to get out there and they're like, what the fuck am I doing? I have a family. Let's knock these guys out one at a time. What the fuck are we doing here guy? Oh, someone got smacked in the. He goes down. He's got the ball and went down. Then another guy took his place is just sort of avoiding the whole thing. This ball guy looks gay as far. No. All. Oh, see, this is the guy gets knocked down, but look, as soon as he gets knocked down, another guy steps in and fights the guy that he was fighting before he got knocked down.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Oh, what a bizarre stupid. Turns into just like a melee of madness and it's just. It's actually interesting to watch the clusters happen. Like the energy going into one place. Only one black guy. Yeah, I know.

Speaker 2:          04:05          That's why it's so. That's why it's so boring. Nobody wants. And these guys are professional athletes.

Speaker 1:          04:17          It's like they trained for it. Like it's, it's almost like a. what's that thing the iron man? It's like a voluntary thing that they do. It's tradition. If you do it, if your dad did it. Oh God. Yeah. So stupid. And so rediculus. Uh, but there's a lot of tradition in it and see everyone wears like joker uniform.

Speaker 2:          04:37          Sure. What is that guys that are humping? This still is bothered. It's like, Hey, do you guys get this guys back? But he's not doing anything. By the way. He should go out there when your commentary like where all the black people. This guy's fucking gay to more buckeyes, getting happy now. They just took them off the bed. Another Sicilian. This guy's annoying. You've got adoption scale. Well, it just seems like a. You mean a few of these guys are okay. Pulling people off. Going on.

Speaker 1:          05:06          See the yellow guys in yellow. That's when people get fucked up. Yeah. They just get taken off the field and then they have to play. I think it's 2:20 minute quarters and then the winter, the winters have to play again the next day again that three days in a row, the championship is four days later and the winning team, their prize is a cow. The Cow. You get a cow, a cow, get money. You don't get endorsed. The thing I like about it, that attracted me to it, there's no endorsement deals. There's no. Nothing's been promoted. It's just people that want to fucking fight each other

Speaker 2:          05:41          I don't understand is where's the leg kicks? Do you guys not understand about leg kicks? Their Italian? Yeah, but they're not. There's a few kicks being thrown, but no, it's Tony Lake kicks. They're standing right in front of each other, but there's no takedowns, so there's no takedown tabs. It's just shitty boxing would the occasional kick this is.

Speaker 1:          05:58          It's basically just like a giant street fight.

Speaker 2:          06:01          Right? But these guys have a little bit of skill. Like I'm looking at the way these. A lot of the city. Here's a takedown like this, but nothing happens. So you can take a guy down, but look at the way these guys are like standing in front of each other, like chicken.

Speaker 1:          06:12          I think they probably get out there and like are like, wait, what am I doing? Let's just pace around and see if we can just get through this 40 minutes without. It's so weird because they just exchange partners.

Speaker 2:          06:22          They move back and forth. Like they, they, they square off and then they decide I don't want to fight you. I'm going to fight your friend.

Speaker 1:          06:28          Well it's so interesting because think about it. It's like these are not trained guys, but it's like if you put 20 people fighting, there's no pressure to do it right away. Right. You know, it's like when do you decide it's time to take you to, you know, oh Jesus, this is really, what is this guy? But the ball's going to go through. It's got to get through. Yeah. And then they're just talking shit like that

Speaker 2:          06:49          kick. Like how do you get. Does no one know how to kick?

Speaker 1:          06:53          No. I think most people, unless they're in Thailand probably don't. I went and saw those fights in Thailand, had to watch those, but the point is, there's.
