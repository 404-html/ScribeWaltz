Speaker 1:          08:26          Oh, high ball goes in and you scratch. You don't win anywhere on the table. Well, you have is a nightmare.

Speaker 2:          08:39          It's not a victory. You have a one ball that's wide open, but the two balls tied up with the eight. You'd have to play to eight combination then

Speaker 1:          08:47          all have to go off of one more, right?

Speaker 2:          08:49          Yeah. I mean if you can possibly knock those balls free once you make the one ball. Do you see last standing? The new one? No, no, no. You're good. I heard it's better, but because Rosanne's kidding. Russell Peters is on the behind the scenes, but that you breakout star from that Shimmy. Shimmy Schumer is the answer. Yeah. We got along well.

Speaker 1:          10:33          This blackberry go, whoa. This is your shot. And you can't even hit the one ball pit. Yes. Yeah. Make an eight ball. I fuck's bill. Good luck. Can you want me drunk people I've talked to her, convinced her good pool. It's quite fascinating. You reviewed this job. I'm telling you right pocket. It seems like the universe doesn't love you.

Speaker 2:          11:35          This is interesting. Play pool as the good person that knows how to play pool and somebody is able to leave their shots.

Speaker 1:          11:43          Okay, seriously.

Speaker 2:          11:54          Who? Yeah, I can do it too. All ended up there.

Speaker 4:          12:03          No, we should ask you a question. Sure.

Speaker 2:          12:06          Did you go for the five ball that way as opposed to this way? Cause it, but they do do that. I shot, I have two shots a on site as possible or fly ball here. The problem playing the size, but we're gonna have to hit it lighter have, but I didn't come back properly cause I have a bad angle. I honestly, if I did want to come back, I would want to have an angle just about two inches that way so that I could stay on this side of the ball because that's what scares me right there. No, it's not scary. But this side pocket, I couldn't, I now I'm not going to play. No, I'm playing because of the angle plane to come down here and then shoot this ball in the side pocket because the angle's not good though. The Pool, when you play a certain level, it's all about um, maintain the correct angle to go from one ball to the other.

Speaker 2:          13:02          Ideally, I would've liked to stop anywhere around right here. So funny. I would, I would have stopped. I wouldn't try to stop here. There's I one with that shot as opposed to the natural. That's good too, but I wanted to, once I make the ball, I want to wind up right around here and we're in town right now. It's very hard to do that because we're telling right now the natural angle of shooting the ball and it's going to make the ball go this way, so now I have to adjust to that and I have to make the ball go this way and then out here and I have to hit it and I hit up to here with low right hand English so that when it hits the table, it's the rail, it bounces off and gets good. The other thing that I noticed is whenever I break, I break with Tom English. I've only broken that way. I've never broken. You broke, you broke using the bottom. It doesn't matter if you could stop the ball. I like to use bonding, but some people do like to talk as a plow suitable.

Speaker 4:          14:08          When you hear something

Speaker 2:          14:09          said they're good at pool, you're like, oh, but how good are you? I just hope I don't get left for them. Easy shot and I can't make that right. Well, it's one of those things where I find that, like when we're talking about like archery play, that's what Sean did. Well, people do archery and he got a tech.

Speaker 1:          14:52          You do a bunch. That was good. That was good. Very nice. I got a couple more. Oh No, I'm good. I'm good. I can get out of your body finally that take their liver disease, this whole other side of my body.

Speaker 4:          15:21          Why didn't you know where you live? Yes.
