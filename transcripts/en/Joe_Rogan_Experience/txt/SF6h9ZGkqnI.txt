Speaker 1:          00:00:03       It's always hard to stop a conversation and then we started in a natural way after you smoke pot at 10:00 in the morning on a Monday. It's just one of those things. Lot. Yeah, it's too much going on. We can't be asked to start and stop a conversation. That was pretty smooth. It was just like, hey, we're going to go. Yeah, this is the pot pauses are weird, man. Like, and start the show data that uh, it's really, you got to listen to a whole theme song and then you going to wait. And then like how long ago? That was the wrong way to do it. We made a few mistakes. The big one was um. Oh, is that me? Whoops. I haven't done that in a long time. I thought I had this close to swear to God. I come the apple thing when you hit your apple TV press play on your fucking itunes on your computer.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Does it? Yeah. All the time. You're like, no, stop that one. Just that one. Oh No. Both. Both. So if you have apple TV and the computer open at the same time. So if you're watching on TV and you have a computer or if you have a quicktime file on the desktop or starts playing. Oh Wow. How annoying. Blockers for the sense of. Sometimes even when it's closed, it's still starts it up and eating. My fucking phone started making my computer ring the other day. Company. Yeah, we were in here. My computer is ringing. I was like, what kind of dog? Shit. Chilling out. Watching a sure that I watch, I guess. Yeah. Obviously I'm sure it's totally not connected. They already look at everything we do. Come on, come on. We don't even notice it. I know. It's pretty nice making your computer ring. Do my phone and my computer ring. They're connected in some way.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       Something new. Update new. Made Mike fucking my phone. Made my computer rang. Like what? What are we doing here? Change your life. We are just given into the Borg. Why don't we just admit it? Yeah. Why don't we admit it? Who's going to be the first one to get their legs cut off for some new bionic book? Each of our buildings? Yeah, Bro. You to get to keep your cock and balls chopped off and have a fake legs, broke his legs, never get tired, man. Are you tired of walking all the time? You get your cock and balls, balls. Most important part. You want to keep these stupid meet vehicles or do you want to get the cyber 2000 cyber 2002 legged system? It's amazing, man. It doesn't even feel it'd be. You totally feel like your own legs, but they never get tired. Dude, you wouldn't even, you would only need head and cock, you know, you could replace everything else.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       I wonder. Here's the question. If you could live with everything else being yes fingertips. Um, maybe one hand. I'd like to hand and cock phase. Here's the thing. If, if, if people are smart enough to start manipulating bodies like that, do you think they're going to keep the same shape that we have now? Oh yes. Go round like the rod to from the New Star Wars. I don't think that's beneficial. I was thinking that looks right. Would there be a better designed than this bipedal hominid form that we use? Like would we get to a point where like aesthetically, like we started changing things on people, you know, like have a chainsaw hands while I was thinking like Minotaur bodies, like clearly you know, how much of you wants to be a person, how many legs want run a lot faster on four legs, so the first guy to have four legs and everybody's like Whoa.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       And for no reason it doesn't make any sense, but girls are like, that's hard to get lucky. Some fucking freak DNA thing that pops in a female's head when they see a man with four legs and they just can't help themselves. Oh my God, I just did this to get faster, but this is nice. Yes. To asses, you know, if I got a minute or I would hire all the viral companies and the, and the PR firms and like get it out there where it's an attractive thing. Make It. Part of this is that everyone says, oh yeah, yeah, that's hot. More legs. So hotter, higher, higher like Leonardo Dicaprio to say it. That could totally be done. Yeah. You've seen some of the crazy things that people are doing with their bodies these days. Definitely want something different. One, we'll one. We'll tude. There's so many like weird body modifications today. I was jealous when those shoes with the wheels came out of the bottom of the shoes. We'll never made it for adult sizes. So I was pissed about that. To make feet with wheels on it. You should start a company licensed the product. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good idea actually. They'd be so much. Why is it no fun to do it as an adult? I don't understand the problem.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       Straight away. You can't fucking. You're not supposed to be enjoying so far. You're, you're a grownup. Supposed to stop the one with chores wheeled around the mall. I can asshole wieland thing, man. I would love it. But you got to stay on your back. Feet seems like an awkward way to stand. It's probably bad for old people like pop in back wise. You look back a lot of strain on the back like that. She, Tyson wiping out on that. Uh, that dude those things. The first time I got on one, I can do one now, but the first time I got on one it was at the comedy store. And um, this dude who's a comic, what is his name? Jamie know that dude's name. You know what I'm talking about, right, sir? Ben Kingsley, I don't know. Might have been. I forgot his name. Nice guy. Anyway, he, uh, he has a white one who's tooling around the parking lot with tate and I go, how, how

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       hard is it to do? And he goes, try it. I got it. I couldn't imagine doing it. I got on and I was like, there's no way I'll ever get good at this is fucking insane. Like, what is it? Just two wheels and basically it's essentially, it's some form of a gyroscope and it's like those scooter things that they have the mall. What are those things called again? Segues, segways, segway things. Have you ever ridden one of those? No. Really Fun. Kevin James had one on the set of that. Zookeeper moving. Yeah. He actually had a couple of them and he would zoom around the parking them. Do Dare fucking fun. They're really cool, but when they run out of batteries, you go flying. Then another stop brighter. Do the battery just breaks. If the battery runs out of juice, you go down hard on it because it's the only reason why it's keeping you up, but you're not doing that yourself. Like it's a gyroscope like gets it's counter balancing you as you really can't be a stable. Oh, you could definitely fall. You definitely can fall, but it's really easy to ride like you don't. I hope I'm saying gyroscope properly or explaining the physics behind. No idea what a gyroscope is to be honest. Scooters it called. Yeah. What would you say that it's run like a gyroscope? Is that. Am I making things? It's a gyroscope of the thing that you get to the air and space museum. The thing that's keeping balance like house.

Speaker 2:          00:07:19       Can you pull up the definition of gyroscope? Just so I don't feel like an idiot. I just want to know if that's what it is because I've always been saying that. But, um, now that I'm, I'm, I'm thinking while I'm saying, am I right that that's a gyroscope, I have no idea what a gyroscope covers, whatever it is, whatever this technology they've invented for segue there, you pull the string and it stays. It stays spending forever. Yeah. The orientation of the access is unaffected by tilting the rotation of the mounting. Okay. So that does make sense. But also in like drones to keep them up, right? Oh. Oh. Really? GPS to help them keep up. Right to the good Lord. Was the drone almost switch gear? Yeah, we watched it. What the fuck, man? You remember the guy who died in the segway guy died.

Speaker 2:          00:08:03       We went off a cliff at one of the guys that own the company or the inventor of it died on a segway going off a cliff when he went to patent that thing my friend worked at the patent office. When he came in, he didn't, he didn't submit any, like a blueprint. You just brought one in and had everybody write it. First of all, why is he near cliff? Why is he like got on the road? Oh, he went off the cliff then. Off-Road segue. Oh, what a terrible idea. Until they have it. I don't know. But if they do, that's a terrible idea. Road segway because unless those things are like way improved, I would think that the batteries, like if you couldn't rocks and shit, giant tires. The idea of like running over a rock and hitting your electrical system. Me As someone with zero knowledge of even how electricity works. I'm just going to comment on this already. You know, like I don't know what the fuck electricity

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       is. I know you can't stick a fork in the hole or you die. That's what I have such a fucking idiot. People like. Hold on because your feet though. Connect like shut up. You don't know. He was this dude. What are you showing me? The TV shredder. It looks like a four. We'll segue segue. It's just real. Look at where to hold gas masks. Looks like Halo. This is like a fucking. Oh my God. He's wearing a business suit. This is insane. It's got tires like a tank. That is so crazy. That desert video. You gotta show me a video though. I think it goes sidesaddle sports. Yeah, I guess right. That guy in that position. Yeah, that seems weird. That seems like a weird way to stay. Maybe it's just that one picture. Look at this fucking little mini tank. That is bad ass.

Speaker 1:          00:10:03       Wow. Like fucking why not, right? Oh, he's going up the wall. No way there was going to jump. Just a seesaw. A seesaw wise is one of the dumbest tricks, but why this is to show that he can go over obstacles. Oh whoa. No Way. They're going, oh my God. Like nothing. Hell yes. Oh, this thing is actually really bad podcasts over. Let's go. Easy. Dude. This is crazy. What is it called? This a DTV shredder. Oh, that one. The thing. It's not even that heavy. Like when he falls down and she wouldn't just fell down, look like he just picks it up and moves it. Like it's not that big of a flip back on. Yeah. Look, we're not talking a motorcycle. That's why the fuck do you want a fucking commercial for this? Seems like we're doing a commercial for those. I've never even heard of this until seconds ago.

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       I swear. This is bullshit. I see what you're doing, dude. Fucking product place. DTV slash job broken right now. You get 10 percent off free shipping. What the fuck is that man? That's a shredder plates. Some 14 year old boy got like 10 million bucks and said I'm starting my own company. But you have a rapper who had about rappers trick. Couldn't everything in their home. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the white version of it. There it is. The atvs or like a white man's? Yeah, like an ATV. If you're like, if you're white trash and you got like really powerful Atvs, like you are running shit. You got a good piece of land. We could just drive through mud. Fuck yeah. Let's go to bobby's right. Those atvs. Medan. That's fun and shit. I don't want those atvs. Oh my God. They're so fun. Really. Three wheel things will there four wheels, but that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       Those like motorcycle motorcycle things. Yeah. Do Funny Shit. Yeah. I've, I've been in a bunch of different kinds of little buggies to jumping and stuff. He. Oh No, no, no, no, just you driving through the woods and um, they're really fun. Oh yeah, yeah. It's really bouncing, but they can get out of anything and they'd go into the woods and drive over logs with them and shit. Hell yeah. You take those things up in Canada and my friends in Canada, the rivets that run this hunting camp and Canada, they have an argo and argo is like a mini tank. It's the, it's, it's, it goes amphibian, it goes through the water. Lily, two things. My friend John Rivett from up in Canada, so he needs it. He goes moose hunting. So they, they'll, they'll kill a moose and they have to drag it out of the woods and they have it on this fucking mini tank.

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       Whoa dude. What? You've have to see this. Then they have different wheels form, like sometimes they have like wheels, like giant truck tires, but other times they put tank treads on them and they looked. They can go deep into the woods. They just drive through shit. Like you could buy a tank, but sounds fun. See you pull up a video of an argo so I could show him what. What he's talking about. These dudes, the rivets, they have all sorts of Atvs, but this argo is the mother. This is the mother. Like if you're stuck, this motherfucker will get you out. It's the mother. It just goes deep into the woods. It's a tank. Fucking small tank gets over everything. Everything. Blogs. Look at it, look at it. Look at it. Okay. This is one of 'em. This is. They have to go into the water.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       See the tank treads? Yeah. Some of them just tilt it. You can drive through water with these fucking things. Wow. Bill. They had, I don't know. It's some hillbilly shit. Whoever's making them. You know they're appealing to back that up. Backed it up. She could see that. Where the one has tree. Look at that right there. We can see the trees. No, he's gonna tank tread. There's tank tread on these things. I mean it's a fucking tank tank for the forest. Wow. I see girls right now would be so angry if they were here. Who Cares? Why don't live in the forest, ladies? I'm so sorry that we don't see things the same way. This is like for a girl going through creeks and shit would be cool like that. Will it be the female equivalent for something like this? Like awesome handbags, girls who have bought some shoes, shoes thing, right? Be a shoe thing, man with money.

Speaker 1:          00:14:44       Older man with money in a heart condition. Oh my God. You have got to see this. What he barely breathe. She bad. His wallet is terrifying. That, that, that, that some old dudes like that really are preyed upon like that. Yeah. Nobody protects them. No, there's no like guys come on and they can't make their own decisions. I know a dude who got taken really older dude, but so few of a girl. No, he had a younger or younger girlfriend that he met on one of those weird dating sites and uh, two years and she was involved in his business. Hundreds of thousands of dollars went missing. It's just got to this weird state. He had a jess and jettison the experience. You know, I am in its old dudes. It's old people in general, you know, he started getting older, he truly don't want to be alone and if you're really old and you're wealthy and you just find some girl who seemed so nice, but every time she makes your teeth start, just start feeling weird diarrhea and I don't know what's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       Is something wrong with. Maybe you're anxious because of the new girl. Maybe it's just, maybe I just, you know, I haven't been having sex since my wife died and I'm 85 years old now and I can't believe this girl even wants to be with me. I mean it's just what a treasure and what a blessing from the Lord. But God, every time she makes me, he doesn't want to admit it. You okay baby. We're still gonna do it. Do you not think I'm hot anymore? He's in baby. I love you. I just know I'm 85 years old. One second. I just got asked blood slowly. She's eaten through his insides. I, those, those fucking shows like those um, uh, murder shows where they talk about like, no, no, no. Like, um, when you talk about like a different people that it did like a, like there was one that was a nurse that was purposely poisoning all of the people that she was taken care of too, that they were just crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       She crazy. She was crazy too. Is purposely poisoning patients to go to work. Yeah. I don't think she was doing it to get out of work. I think she was just killing people. I think she was just crazy. It just was a few years back. But the idea that someone would, uh, would want to consciously, slowly kill someone with a poison like, Woo, Woo. There want to just move on with your life, bitch. Leave that poor guy in the bed alone. No, she, she got off on it or something. Something. She was killing them while they were in her care. They were thinking about what it'd be like. Oh God. It's dark.

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       It's, it's amazing how few people kill people. Really, when you think about it. I'm mad people get at each other and a few people actually get killed. Awesome. Well, awesome. Fucking hanging in there, man. You know, I mean think about how many times I walk around and no fear of any physical violence. Yeah. Almost never. You have to be in the total wrong place at the total wrong time or drinking if you're drinking anything and especially if you're one of those guys, but I just free to walk around with plenty of money in my pocket. Yeah. That's for anyone to just being like everyone has a wallet. Like you keep your cash cashman. How long before? That's not real anymore. How long before paper money is gone? That's kind of becoming right. I'm ready for the trip. Wow. You're ready to give in to the board, which is chip.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       Someone's ready to give it to the board and get some more legs. You've ever seen those videos of the order for the phone to work, you have to get a horse leg it chip in. That's what they're gonna do it eventually. Like, okay. Anyone who hasn't still have the chip in and the horse legs, we're going to. We're going to give you free ones now because everyone has to be on TV. It would be like certain things you couldn't get, you couldn't get on the internet anymore, so they will deprive you of your services. Got To join that board saying my phone will no longer work overseas, but if you want an overseas phone, they think they can get me one. It's hilarious. If you don't know, Ladies and gentlemen, Ari should. Fear has done one of the bravest things that any man has ever done. He went from an iphone to a flip phone. The chunkiest little 1979 technology flip phone at the time. It was super advanced. Like what? Your sporting in your pocket at one point in time. Yeah, absolutely. It's undeniably. Yeah. I just like super advanced. I had to find this one. The first was just the free, like best buy. Go get it over there.

Speaker 1:          00:19:36       Yeah. You started off with a regular one when you had to do like four presses to get an s. How is it possible? That was really, really tough. It's stupid. This double flip is the future man. Yeah. Well you know what? The real future is word recognition. Oh yeah. Whole typing thing. It's so stupid. It's gone. It's on its way out. It's so close. It's so close. They're so good now. Like as far as showed me, it was dead on. I use it for notes all the time. I'll say something into notes and I just, it comes out almost perfect. Like weird things get spelled wrong if it's a weird name or something like that, but that's to be expected. It spells it phonetically. Got Ra got red. You know, what else did Washington Post? Is that what it was to wash it? But it's already should fear was a goddamn answer to a crossword puzzle, ladies and gentlemen. So suck it haters. My mom and sister said it's a me. It's a layer. So they were getting all sorts of phone calls. Yeah. And I was like, no way. It's such a. that's such a non comedy. Yeah. That's. You've transcended son. So unquestionably. You've now transcended. That's like a

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       comedian show seven across. Weird. Said you're famous. You're on TV. What do you expect that, that you haven't been there enough for someone to get it here. Don't suck it. Yeah. You're doing the right thing though. I liked, I liked the fact I. I would never do what you're doing with your phone, but I like what you're doing. What you're doing is you're looking at the data and deciding, okay, how much willpower do I have? Not Enough. Fuck this. Yeah, there you go. That's how. That's where to put it. I analyze the stats on my life and I was like, oh, I can't stop. But you did it very intelligently. Like it's very difficult to do. It's very difficult for people to not just look at some weird addiction that they might have, but to say, okay, even though there's all this amazing convenience of being able to buy movie tickets and being able to check websites and answer emails on your phone, it's not worth it. That's the justification. It's not worth it. It's too much. Well, you know how when you see someone on TV smoking cigarettes, you never really smoked, Huh? No, I never spoke. Only smoke. When you see somebody just triggers like, oh, I need to smoke to you, get in your car. Some people smoke no matter what, just or whatever. I wanted the comedy store at smoke. You know, it's funny though, when I see people get high, it does the opposite. It makes me not want to get high go. My God. Do I sound that stupid?

Speaker 2:          00:22:16       You know, because sometimes you'll say things when you're high and as you're saying, let me like, like you would if you were to go, oh my God, he's an idiot. But believe me, I'm saying, Oh my God, I'm an idiot. Come say as I'm saying it, I'm thinking I'm an idiot sometimes. I'm like, this is somebody should write this down or lift the media because it's brilliant here the next day. And you're like, what? I did a scene on news radio once with Bob Costa, who's a very nice guy. Bob Cost is great. He's very, very intelligent guy too. And we had the scene and um, I uh, he beats me up pillar custard, flip me. He does this like judo flip and go into my ass for some strange reason. Um, but afterwards we were all out talking and while we were talking I had smoked pot and I was rambling to him as I was.

Speaker 2:          00:23:08       I remember talking to him about dupont making the chemical compound for nylon, like at the same time when they made hamp illegally, some stupid ass minimum that I'm like, shut bombs, mom, words coming out of my mouth, I'm going to shut. My brain is telling you, your brain is telling you. Stop it. Shut up. Just A. Oh, I don't know. I mean he was, he's a gentlemen and I'm sure he didn't even call me on it. I just realized that while I was doing it. Then you have to be like, this is a super nice guy. He's a really a really interesting guy. Very, very smart. You know, certain dudes like you talked to, you go, oh, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       Fucking sharp. Yeah. There's a few guys like that. He's a very sharp guy and he's a, he's in an interesting position to as a a sports commentator who also gives like really well thought out opinions, agree with them or disagree with them about gun violence. About a lot of other things, but like important social issues. Yeah. Bob Costas. Oh, you know what I'm talking about place? I think it's hip hop Costa. I thought it was just another person guy. Yeah. Bob Costas. Yeah. You gotta see the diaper guy? The diaper guy. Who's diaper water? Bob Constants is the guy that doesn't like football. Right, and Marv Albert. I have no idea. Does that. He used to do that late night. Show it later with bulk costs. That's something like that was. It was late night for a little while. Super fucking smart guy, man. How dumb is that billboard for the late night show where they're putting makeup.

Speaker 1:          00:24:44       That daily show girl be a girl. Oh, the one we were looking at. Well, you know, they're just trying to get your attention. If it says like, if you don't like it, you're sexist or if you don't watch it, you're sexist. Even the name of it full front, it's just like, come on, let him let him fucking just be good hosts. All of them. All the minorities, they just keep pushing them into like being that thing of girls or minority. Yeah, girl TV. That's an interesting way of putting it. I've never heard a girl be described as a minority even though they're 52 percent. Yeah. That the underrepresented on television, what's it? I would see a ratio on TV. Yeah. I have no idea. When you say underrepresented, like less than half the people on TV are girls. Yeah. Really? Standup is a lot more to do. It's really. Show me more about what you think about movies or TV shows. It was very few walking dead. Women have an even number.

Speaker 1:          00:25:38       They have an even number of boys and girls, you know, and somehow those people aren't hooking up like what do we. Not Forever. I remember that couple barely and they just fall deeply in love while they fight off the zombies. Get the fuck Outta here. They never even filed. Land was watching him in that one episode. He was just staring at them. Fuck. Oh, that's right. The comedian, Josh. Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh is looking at and let them look. Do you remember how we worked with Josh would do that Gig? Was it Duncan? Might've been Duncan on me and uh, we're in Arizona. Yeah, we were in Arizona and this was, I think this was a d has no show started it, but I don't know the way, the reason I went out on the road with Joe Rogan is because he needed a second person to open for him because Diaz was at best 70 slash 30 to show up.

Speaker 1:          00:26:30       It was more than that. He was more than that. In all fairness, there was only a few instances where it didn't work out, but I get stuck with nobody. So you'll find the hub to case he showed up. I'll have to no big deal. I'd Joey and I always felt like I have an obligation to let joey be Joey. What great. When it's like, Oh, you might not show up today. I'll just hire more people. This is your job also. We don't have this problem. I knew like even way back in the day that show he was special special guy and he's special. He's important for everybody. Yeah. You know, he's like an engine and he's beautiful. He's, if you get close to him, he's beautiful. He's the best. He's the best. That kind of shines like inside like this. Why we all love to be around them because you can, you know, if you're.

Speaker 1:          00:27:18       Even if you're busy or something like this will be a 92nd phone call. He's getting phone calls every day. Yeah. I mean he's a classic original, but he, you know, he had problems back then. But you saw something, right? I knew it. I just knew it. I just knew it. Oh Man, this guy just needs. He just needs to be. Just leave him alone. He'll figure it out. He's closing my storyteller show again, stir. We're going to end the season with them every year. He's a monster. He could do that forever, by the way. Yes. He never runs out of storage. It's insane. I've never met anybody who I've known him for what fucking almost 20 years and he just always has new stories and there and people will go, this didn't have like, yeah, no. He gets verification, Verification. Fucking call people up, put him on speakerphone.

Speaker 1:          00:28:05       Tell him that fucking time. Verification. Joey Babaloo. No, in fucking north Bergen has these, these conversations with people. Verifications, Verification, Verification, triple ecology for verification. That's right. Was it. I don't remember what it was, but was the verification from onstage? She calls you and you were at the Improv? Yeah. What did I. What was it? This girl said, oh, we're not friends, and I said, I have my phone or something like that. That's exactly right. The fact that I'm getting on the phone proves it. Oh yeah. It was a heckler. Who's being mean to him? Nobody's better with the hecklers and triple, triple. He's franchise. He's been in the trenches. Yeah. Diaz Tripoli's a comedy store at dude. Those comedy store guys, especially us from like the nineties, there was no. Nobody was. There was no crowd control. Completely get off like there's no one fighting for 10 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:28:59       No one's even telling him to shut up. How come fucking Holtzman got knocked out? Oh, I remember. He got. He got punched in the face by someone's bodyguard. Ultimately one time tackled somebody walking by the front row and the original room and they walked in between the front row of chairs and the table chairs. You know, this was one of the words like it's a stage one, like with the tables, so they're walking through there and he saw them. He just leaned over and grabbed onto their shoulders and just left his body weight drop. I just brought him to the ground. We're just going back to their seat.

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       Let me ask you this. As a responsible person and an adult, if you're running that business, do you fire a gun check theirs? Is that how you look at it? Can Be like you can't. That's why yelp reviews of comedy clubs and some of the greatest things in the world because they point out stuff that you'd be like. They're doing it as a yelp review of a business, but they're like. Literally one of the employees said, I hope I die in a fire when I'm going home. It's like, imagine if a waiter set out to you and then they're like, oh, you're talking about David Taylor came from running you out of there and now he's trying to hurt you, so you think about it on the way home.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       I don't want your business that you're running out of there too. You were probably a dick enough to be like, we don't want you back. That's the most important. What will you. You can run into Dick's man, and a lot of times it's just people that don't know how to behave. Like Chapelle was at the store the other night and some guy kept yelling shit out at. I'm in the crowd. Started yelling at the guy to shut the fuck up. That's both. Oh, was he was just so obnoxious, but he just couldn't believe he was talking to Dave Chappelle, you know, he's just drunk and he fucked up and the people around him were responding and it started getting Shitty, but the star never had anybody to like, you can't do that at the Improv. They will grab you and they'll pull you out of there.

Speaker 1:          00:31:02       Like they, they like was this comedian, so we're outside fucking smoking pot. No one's parent attrition. We're worried about talking to this chick. No one's paying attention. You have to get a door guy. Yeah, but you know what? I would say that it's way less necessary today than it's ever been before. The crowds have been amazing at the store lately. They also sort of, okay, here's the thing. This is why Canadian crutches better too, because it's if you go into it and like your listeners good with an understanding of like, here's the etiquette of what it's like to be in a comedy show. Like I sort of get it already. Then they're just like a base level better crowds. Like I know you're supposed to shut up and laugh and that's it. Some people didn't get that message going on though, man. That's part of what it is.

Speaker 1:          00:31:46       Some people, they don't just don't know that yet. Like what? Like what is. No one else is doing this. Yeah. I think it's hard for some people that grew up around morons. You know, if you grow up like exclusively around morons and you've been responding to morons or whole life, then all of a sudden you're drinking dave Chappelle's onstage. You can act like a moron. You, you don't even know why you're doing it. Like as it's coming out of your mouth, you're like, who is this asshole representing the great spirit that is inside? And I used to have more problems like right after Chappelle show with a. They would yell at those catchphrases at him. Oh, he had a real problem once it was at the House of Blues I think, or something like that. One of those places. And yes, young tour. Yeah. I remember people kept yelling out, you know, all the different phrases, you know, and she's like, what?

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Can't go anywhere at this. Yeah. What was the Big One? What was that Big One? I'm Rick James Bitch. I'm Rick James Bitch. That was one. They kept yelling at him. He had, when he came back from Africa or whatever, he had a show at the store, the comedy store, and it was mobbed that everybody's are. Soundgarden came and Bruce Willis came. Yeah, I was mobbed and that way oversold and uh, the fire department showed up and it was like trouble, but they just wanted to sit on the steps, watch while he was the biggest thing that was that. But there was Shrek. They told everybody, you say a word and you're gone. And there was a line out the door, people not being able to get in. Well, and when magical was on, I think he had two guys open for a magical. It's a black guy, I forget who.

Speaker 1:          00:33:16       And then he went on, um, somebody heckled a little bit from the front row and they just yanked him right out. Then somebody came right at, got a front row seat because was just fucked up. Yeah, man, I think people are learning. Yeah, I get it. If you don't like the person who's on stage. I've, I've lived outside, go get a cigarette and come back in and said I, I'll sit and watch the show. And if someone is not doing well, can you say something? If your waiters being super rude to you or somebody, a plumber is being an asshole to you, like, hey man, you're being a dick it out, but not if it's ruining everyone else's experience. You know, like a movie. Go outside and complaint. Well, it's just, it's not necessary. If other people were enjoying it for you to enjoy pleasure.

Speaker 1:          00:33:58       Yeah, and that happened sometimes. You mentioned leading star wars going, this is a kid's movie I don't like. This is for kids. Kids Go, who are you rooting for me? But again, we know that because we're in the business. I think for a lot of people this is all they don't understand and then there's also people who will tell you later, you should be able to hear and losing. We were up on stage. You should be able to handle anything they throw at you. It's like one of the ways I had to handle this is to make you leave by an off duty cop who's working with some weird thing. When people tell you what you're supposed to be able to do, like as a comedian, you're supposed to be able to handle it, that magic going to a restaurant, throwing a plate onto the floor, and so will, you know, because deal with spills all the time, don't you?

Speaker 1:          00:34:42       You should be able to handle it. Somebody literally said when, when the subject of stealing jokes came up, look, you should be able to write more jokes. I remember someone saying that like, you should be able to write more jokes. Oh, it's fucking so simple. Yeah. So what are the other things? Like you have a job before the boss who's abusing you. Well, you should be able to get a better job. Yeah. What? I haven't been a job but a job rapes, mess hall commentary, you know, days, asshole, commentary. That's all it is. I like to just walk away from those people. You can do it online, but we're trying to educate you. Get out of here. That's so funny man. It's so true. God. Right. We should draw. You told me early on when you started, like really like what you would be vicious with Pete with those

Speaker 2:          00:35:37       hecklers. Don't you feel bad? You were like, they've already shown them they're assholes. So No, no mercy, no reason to show mercy. What they're doing is trying to be mean, like they're yelling shit out, trying to interrupt, and a lot of them, the reason why they're doing it is because they just want attention. They know it's not even what you're saying. They just, for whatever reason, they wanted to do an open mic night. They never did it. They got drunk and here they are and they feel like I'm going to fucking get disarmed. She fear this guy can't handle what I'm coming with them. Can you fly around the room with those times?

Speaker 3:          00:36:14       Did I just do gay guys at the stand? And they were mad at me because it was one of those things with drugs will mishear one word, you know? And they'll just be like that. No, no. I was saying I don't like people who hate black people and black people now and like, no, shut up. It's one of those and they were just being angry and give me the mainstay or all the time and the standard is so small that you can see everybody. It's pretty good. And uh, and then I was like, but you guys don't like this. I was like, I said something like, first smile I got out of you. And they're like, well, whatever. And I just started calling Mr and Mrs poopy pants had just like, belittling them. It's just so fun. And watching them get angrier and angrier. We just talk over people.

Speaker 3:          00:36:50       They're just angry. Well, what were they doing? Just gonna be so mad. Like just giving me means mean mugs. You've seen that when it's like, I'm just going to try to show you how mad I am. Oh yeah, yeah. Things like that. Things like that. I had a woman in Calgary, she was bitching about everybody. The whole open opener should come. Yeah. And it was like, how you got to be quiet? And then she did that thing with like, next Joe and I'm like, beat it. You're out. Get Out, get the fuck out now. What is that going to be above this show? I just railed on it for like 10 minutes and I had to stop by the white crowd. This is not coming out of your time,

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       so the clock stops. Next joke. Oh my God. Yeah. It's like you don't want to be here. Get the fuck Outta here. Just so weird because you can go to like the most amazing movie, but if you're sitting next to someone is going to happen. Oh, you fucking live. Who saw that? Common Stallone. He found a way to get that. That rock pick into the side of the mountain. Just as he's hanging off of it, pulls himself up, be quiet, grabs a log, and drags himself over the top of the cliff. That could happen. Right? She Guy, this guy in Scotland threatened to sue me. Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah, because I told his wife who was. She was ugly. Did you hear what happened in Canada with that? With Mike Ward? Do you know the guy getting sued by tribunals? Yeah, I like him a lot. Was Great.

Speaker 2:          00:38:23       Which one are you talking about? The one with the guy I'm cursed out the lesbians and set a bunch of uh, gay things to them. No, don't called him dykes. Something along those lines. And there was like a nasty exchange trans guy and this girl and I'm the woman sued and apparently I believe one and I don't know, like the specific mental damages. Well I think she sued for like Jamie see if he could pull that up. I don't want to talk. I don't know exactly what the charges were but it was everybody was like Whoa, like, and she won. I think she ain't gonna Award like $10,000 or something. Well then it becomes a thing where it's like you either have to make everyone sign a release for coming to a comedy club or just saying you're going to kill the art form as Jimmy pulls it off.

Speaker 2:          00:39:11       You can't take any more risks. I don't want to misquote anything. So I want to make sure I say this incorrectly, but it was a story I just, I don't know, I'll tell you what happened was to Mike Ward, French Canadian comic, and so he was doing this, there was this kid who was like, make a wish kid, whatever. And uh, they were like, he's going out and it was a big like on TV is like a coke campaign. And then, uh, Mike had a bit about the 10 years later this kid's still alive and he's like, I want my money back.

Speaker 3:          00:39:40       You know, it started going off because I was fucking 23 now. No. And uh, and I think so fucking. And the kid said he got made fun of because of it. Oh my God, it wasn't cool. Jesus was like, well, sorry man, you were like a celebrity and I'm going to make fun of that stuff. And he got taken to a tribunal is going right now to a French Canadian tribunal.

Speaker 2:          00:40:04       Oh No. Oh my God. What are they suing them for? Charging them with or what are they doing a signing up for? I don't know the exact charges, but it's either 80 grand or more. They're sort of for, but the problem is then that just makes anything off limits. It makes any sort of subject where you have no idea. Well, here's the thing. How do you attach a monetary number two, that slurs fo force comic to pay $15,000 more than I thought. Tirade of ugly words against lesbian patron after appeal falls flat. Wow. No appeal. Appeal fell flat. They didn't win the appeal. Yeah, so I think he lost human rights tribunal there. That's what Mike has been brought up into a human rights tribunal. What is going on Canada? What the fuck you do? Lasting physical and psychological effect. What's the physical effect? We'll see.

Speaker 2:          00:40:57       I don't know. I would say, here's one thing. If this woman came to a show, okay, let's let's, let's be honest about this, and, and he just started to register the worst case scenario. I'm on her side. If she, if she's sitting there with her girlfriend and she didn't do anything, she's saying a bunch of lesbian shit to her and being mean to her and just being an asshole and you know, guys have done that, right? We all know comics, W we've all seen bad comics do things like that or take attempts, you know, trying to be funny and it's just defensive. If you paid money to see something like that, no matter what it is, whether

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       it's a black joke, whether it's a, you know, a joke about Asian people and you're getting your, you feel like abused joke about their height. Whereas a line after that and that way really a matter of what is being said, it's not like just a blank subject, right? We can't say what if it's a joke about being black because it could be a joke. You know, he really, here's the problem and you can't really make it up to anyone. Right? It's got to be like you're allowed to say everything. You're gonna not allowed to say everything, but how do you do a monetary number? That's weird. Well, I mean like how do you make, these are my doctor's bills, my cycle, my psychologist bills. This is how much workup I've missed. You could do it that way. I think in this case in grant is not a huge amount of money.

Speaker 1:          00:42:15       It's a lot, but it's not like those Mcdonald's settlements. Right. For comic though, who's working for? Sure. Plus, I'm sure has legal fees. Right. But what I was going to get at is did the girl Heco first? Yeah, I see that. That's what I don't know. See if she did then fuck her. Yeah. Like yeah, he probably shouldn't say mean shit about her. I've seen stories about a guy, a comic going off on somebody, so when the court of public opinion like they get eviscerated because they went off to hard on somebody but then people would have to show. But like none of this lady was heckling everyone in the show. Let's see what it says here in May of 2007. I don't need to read her name. And a girlfriend were at a club in Vancouver, have restaurant Vancouver restaurant with a largely gay clientele.

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       When an open mic night hosted by Mr Earl kicked off, the two women decided to stay according to the latest findings of the human rights tribunal during the show. Mrs purdy's girlfriend had ms dot [inaudible] girlfriend had merely pecked her on the cheek when Mr Earl told the crowd. Don't mind that inconsiderate dyke table over there. You know, lesbians are always ruin it for everybody. Stop right there. Stop right there. Go back up. Let me read that. I've seen that before. All I did was this one, their mom being fully making out and then just dropping everyone. Why else would we say don't mind that inconsiderate. You're ruining it for everyone. I would imagine there's probably some chatter. Yeah, probably that happened. He went off to hard, but we've all seen that. What? They don't want to admit that they did that. Yeah, exactly. It's always that. It's always like, I didn't do anything.

Speaker 1:          00:43:53       All he did was move my chair and it's like, no, why would anyone throw you out when you're a customer for doing nothing? And it was just laughing. Shut up. There's a lot of different kinds of lesbians. Yeah, there's like educated lesbians that are into the art and then there's like the bull dykey lesbians that are like more thicker, bigger boned, right. And then there's a lipstick, lesbians, they all Buddhism as line prompted boost and ms dot parties table and then they escalated the string of slurs and it's like, all right, you don't like it, you're singing artists, get the fuck out. Yeah, I don't like this. So leave. Then it's okay. You can just leave. Really. It's hard to watch your money back fine and get your money back. Or was it this where they just to really pretty interesting women. And one of them did kiss her friend on the cheek lightly in the comic was eating Dick on stage and he started blaming these girls for the fact that he's eating Dick onstage.

Speaker 1:          00:44:52       You ever seen that happen? Absolutely. So here's the day. So we should be fair here. Right? So yeah. So let's say it was that way. So in that scenario they should get their money back and leave. You still can't stop a guy of artists from fucking trying something. Right? Right. You'd never get to know what the line is unless you cross it and then you pull it back a little bit, so if you don't let a guy even try to get to the line, then you're hurting art in general. This is what he said. That's really rude. You're not even lesbians. No Guy will fuck you. That's why you're with each other. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       I'm still on the side. I'm smart. I see myself saying that. My darkest moments for sure depends really. We don't know. We see like, here's another problem. That's a problem with when Kramer did that stuff, it was like, oh yeah, I get it. I get the point of like, I just want to hurt you now, and that's not even what he was trying to do. Here's the thing and looking at it on print here, like, yes, it's so much different. Much different. Looking at it on print is so much different. We're missing. It's just like, first of all, we don't know if that's exactly what he said. I mean, it's just taking from a recording or just from people's memory, like how exactly do we know exactly what he said and she says, he said to call that discrimination, but discrimination is if they wouldn't let them in because there were less young.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       Jamie says in the court case, they used a witness testimony from junk patrons that were there. See, you can't do that because I don't remember guys joke sometimes and I'm a fucking comedian. They. I doubt they remember exactly what he said. Especially if they're hammered. Come on. Everyone was bullying him. He was an asshole. It's like, here's just going down. Here's the thing. Know from Mike or if comics are bad, they will eventually stop. They'll stop or they'll get better, they'll get better, but if you're hecklin he's not going to get. You're just fucking. You're not supposed to do that. And when you do do that, you open the door to chaos. Also. I've had stuff where it's like, I'm going to take it down one road and then I'll, I'll take it clear in the. Don't worry if you just be quiet and listen the whole time.

Speaker 1:          00:46:56       You'll see where I'm going with this and you'll be fine, but if you stop me in the middle, it's going to make it seem really bad what I said exactly. So exactly. If if you get interrupted, you're just going to look bad and it's a long second. Make someone pay money off of doing the art badly. Exactly. Except for when I'm not even saying it was bad. He might have fucking gotten other people laughing at him. Yeah. I don't know what happened. I don't. So it's so hard, but I think the monetary aspect of it. A monetary judgment like come on $15,000. Like what really happened there? Until you can define what really happened. Yeah. It sounds so crazy. She did just come up with a number. 15,000. Pay The money. Give money to people. You have to give them money to leave to get mad at you.

Speaker 1:          00:47:40       Yeah. Can you say shit to people on the street? Can you like call someone a Dick on the story? Here's the thing, if you get sued for that, what is it about like like gay slurs? Is that what it was? What it was that it was a gay thing because like what if he just concentrated on other aspects of her? Yeah, exactly what it was like. You can't get a better girlfriend because you're too empty inside. Like really want to hurt her in a different way. That nothing to do with it. Yeah. People wouldn't be as mad. That was kind of bullshit. It's not about the hurting. It's about the how he's hurting. Yeah. He's hurting her by saying that he can't. She can't get men to fucker. That's why she's a lesbian. She's not even a real lesbian. He's trying to hurt her there because it's like, well, it's like why you listen to.

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       A funny thing to say. That's what a comic would say. He has to try. Yeah. Dissertation on Lesbian Rights. He's also add living, and again, we're not taking this guy side because we don't know what happened. I don't know. I mean who knows? He might have been a dick and then is it up to the rest of the audience that aside, how's Nikki? She was. Or was it just like, no, I felt hurt so I get the money. I. It's just like, it's an art form. You can't stop anyone from doing or saying anything. That's why you allowed to smoke on stage here because like, well it's part of the stage. Just like our pal smoke four cigarettes the other night in a 20 minutes set. Once I saw might have another one. I was like, yeah, it was hilarious. What does it say here? In addition to Mr earls $15,000 penalty, the restaurant was also ordered to pay $70,000 since he was, had a bar tab.

Speaker 1:          00:49:10       He was illegally an employee. Oh my God. So because the comedian had a small bar tab to host the event, the comedian was legally an employee. Oh man, that's sad. It's Earl Lloyd. The tribunal, the tribunal. What is the. What rights do they have? Nordic gods, Greek and fucking thor comes down and slams the hammer at the end of the decision. So stupid looking ms.party. So that Mr the guy, the comedian, that host of the show, we try to say that the lady played a vital and highly dramatic role, utterly disrupting a performance by unpaid volunteers. Comedy clubs like no other places. The quintessential element that distinguishes them from vapid mainstream media is the fearless pursuit of free speech. Let's listen to this though too. Played a vital and highly dramatic role in utterly disrupting or performance by unpaid volunteers from Mike can go on and you guys are for that sentence.

Speaker 1:          00:50:11       When he finished that sentence and he hit that period, the judge should have said this over here when you. When you get out of here. This is over. Oh, she was messing you guys up. Well, I just, I'm on his side. Just by the way he spells things spelled things out like his, his sentencing project and the judge's words. The comic was not giving a comedy performance when he launched into his tirade of ugly words directly at Ms Dot Party. But you can see that there were jokes there. Yeah, that's not true because it was funny, but even if he doesn't land them, it's like if you can see any committee, you can get an expert to say, Oh yeah, here's where he was trying to get a joke. Here's what he's trying to get a laugh. Well, let's scroll back up to the thing that he said to her because it's clearly a joke and if, if, if it's the way for the water, and by the way this is people doing a lot of water, throwing shit. She threw water at him twice instead of telling them, wait a minute, wait a minute. She threw water at him. Yeah. Oh, well that's just silly.

Speaker 1:          00:51:09       Come on. Crazy lady. Like, what are we doing? We kind of, it wasn't enough. We barely hitting each other. We're going to slap slap fest for two glasses of water through it. Two glasses of water and he broke her sunglasses and turn and he broke it. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       What? What do they do? And they're like, chimps, smack and trees. I could see that somebody threw a glass of water at me and the throat. Another one, and it was a girl, so I couldn't hit her. I'd be like, well, you can't just fucking. I could see. Wow, I can see that. Fuck. If I would not as Mr Earl told that. However, even lesbians, no guy will fuck you. That's why you're with each other. That's the joke. Yeah. Well, it's clearly joke. Well, listen to his, his point of view though, he says the couple was passionately kissing in the front and repeatedly interrupting the set with obscenities

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       when Mr Earl tried to shut up the table with the quip. You're not even lesbians. No Guy will fuck you. That's why you're with each other just thus kissing off the ugly escalation. Well, okay, so that's the exact situation that's happened a billion times that you've seen. People are being way too loud and disruptive and they don't believe they are. They have no idea. Well, it's people who were talking about before. So this tribunal said, okay, if that happens and you're too harsh, you're going to have to pay money that you can't afford. It's an open mic or is paying 15 grand. Canada has legislated politeness. That's how serious they take their politeness up there.

Speaker 1:          00:52:30       They made laws where you have to be polite. Well, in this situation, clubs are going to start recording, filming sets. That's the only way they're going to be out there. I mean this, this owner would have had it been. That takes away the sort of stand up. Comedy is counterculture and part of it exists because like, hey, nobody's recording this. This is all just existing right now in a basement of some whole. I agree and I think that's it. Then you take away like, hold on, right? I, I agree with you. I think it's a beautiful aspect of it, but this poor fucking guy. I mean if this is the landscape, they're going to have to operate again. He's the owner of the God damn club is getting fucked over by an open mic or hood. So Hey, he has no incentive. Now. This isn't just the, the thought of any club, any place, have an open mic at their place. Open mic nights are filled with crazy people and people will become great comedians. Yes, but the ratio very high

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       too crazy. But even the ones that are going to become great or terrible when they're at the open mic. Yes, and they can make terrible decisions fucking right. And they might be one day, 20 years later, your all time favorite comedian, but right now they're clunking their way through everything and spilling their fucking drink and just nobody does it right in the beginning. It's an ad Lib thing. And when you're ad libbing like that, like where there's people in the audience that are disrupting this show, if it's true from his perspective, what he's saying, well they're, they're interrupting with his job and his job is to talk and to be funny. So now you've engaged in some sort of a verbal warfare with a comedian who has a microphone. You can pay for that because they couldn't see where the comedy will. The fact that she threw drinks at home, that's just sort of void out the whole thing. Like I guess was saying, well she was already so disrupted that she had a.

Speaker 2:          00:54:21       I don't know man. I don't like talking about these things if I wasn't there because we all see how this, how this could play out exactly like a show. You've been on that side of that. So he is 100 percent. So now, right now what you're saying is, hey, open mic places don't, don't start. That's the worst part about it. It's going to discourage the clubs from taking a chance and putting on these amateurs who they don't know. These people owe you an open mic night, folks. Let me just put it in perspective. We had a guy who dropped a bomb maybe 75 times at this place on sunset at this recovery place of recovery place with recovery place. It was just where people hung out. Oh, and he did like a set thing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was an open mic. Was open mic and it was so uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:          00:55:05       Whoa. But then whatever he felt it too probably won't do that again. Or he will or he will cut it down about 10 n words or that's his point is just trying to shock everyone. Yeah, that's fine. He said it. He just maybe doesn't know how goofy sounds. Some people don't know how goofy they sound. Yeah, you gotta get a response from people like if you're around and it's going to shock what if that's what you're going for is to offend. That's what you're looking for. That's the emotion you're trying to get out of it audience, and it's like we're going to legislate and say that's not one you can get it out of them or what if it's like you think that that's going to be funny, but it's not like you just suck it. It just. It's not working like you suck at this.

Speaker 2:          00:55:48       Kind of like diy as angry is one of the funniest things ever on his fucking face gets red and he starts getting mad. He started screaming about how when he was a kid, bottled water, he goes, I used to drink puddle water. He's fucking beat red in the face like that. That real anger. That shit's hilarious because he's got jokes and real anger, but when you have like a manufactured anger and you're trying to be edgy, brands can see through them. To me, that's offensive. It's offensive if you're not in the moment for sure. Like when Joey's talking about bottled water, he's in the moment. It's, it's, it's a puddle of water. We've. We've all sort of figured this out in our own way, but when you're on stage and you're locked in, right? You're either. The audience is laughing hard, everything's going great. It feels like some kind of a mass hypnosis in a way because you're conducting them, like pointed them at all.

Speaker 2:          00:56:47       Laugh. Yeah, both. It's, it's that, but it's also like I feel like when I watch were in the audience. I watched bird the other day at the, at the store, the main room and then Chappelle the other day in the EOA locked in to. I loved it. I loved it as a an audience member and I was thinking like when they were doing their jokes and I'm laughing, I'm like going along with their thought process and I'm as it's happening to me, I'm recognizing this thing that it's somehow or another they're thinking for you like they're thinking for you and you just on a ride with those things for you, your comic on stage. No. So when someone had some fake rant and you're like, oh, stop. Like if someone came over your house and went, the problem with the government is programs on tv or programming you.

Speaker 2:          00:57:39       That's what they call them. Programs. You know, if you were, this guy was in your house, you'd be like, will you shut the fuck up? C'Mon man. If dns is in your house and he starts talking to you about some shit you, you just, you have a free show you. It's like a show with Ds. We have shows with him whenever we hang out. Like he'll perform restaurant. He was on the ride over here. It was fun. He's always on. He's a live, you know, I just don't think it should be up to anyone to decide what that line is of right or wrong. Nailed it or didn't nail it. Yeah. You just can't align is different than your law. Even the too soon kind of thing. Like I heard somebody, her Jeff Roth do a joke about something. It was South Carolina but it was like a year later, but I remember people trying to do jokes right there and people like no.

Speaker 2:          00:58:24       And so then jeff did it and it hit and still got an oh, like a year later and you're like, oh, but it's like, oh well I want as far as an audience member is the day of. Yeah. So we just, we like different things. I like spicier foods so it's fine. My favorite example of people saying something isn't funny that was fucking hilarious. Was already laying already laying got in trouble for that twitter stuff because he said, he goes, he goes, I was having sex with. It's really, I'm paraphrasing, I was having sex. It's really hot black girl. And I was on top of her and she goes, I can't breathe. And I'm like, let's not make this political. I'll bring politics into the bedroom politics. People got up and screamed at him at the cellar in New York and they stormed out of there. I mean, this is like, the guy attempted suicide too, by the way. Right? Already, wasn't it like a year before that, like it wasn't like a long time. Maybe

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       two years. Right. So he's just getting back to that, that uh, I can't breathe time. It was like, fuck, fuck you Eric Gardner with those cops about that. And it's like, oh yeah, see me. I felt, I mean this, the only way you would look at it and say you can't make jokes about that is if you feel like it's somehow racist because if it was any other, any other reason like you could totally make a joke about. Yeah. Like you're not even listening to it, right? Just you're just going, I think this is wrong. I'm going to interrupt him. Yell. Yeah. If you listen to what he's saying and the joke like, come on, like that'd be like interrupting fucking a. it's not even a Joe Jonathan swift essay because you're like, wait, are you saying we should kill kids? They just appreciate chosen. Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       Let's get this guy to fuck off. But the joke is not saying it's not making fun of the guy who died in the cops killing him. The joke is making fun of everyone talking about it. Yes, that's it. It's just it. The joke is him with a hot black girl that needs smothering here because he's fat. She says, I can't breathe. I mean, that's a fucking great joke. It's a great joke and it's not mean. Here's the joke. The protests are affecting my life. Last week I was having sex with a black girl. She yelled out, I can't breathe. I want to heat. So he put it on twitter right at the end of 2014. So at the height of the right, right, right. Oh well this was the punchline. I think the black lives matter thing has never been bigger, so I'm thinking you'd say it the harder, but I think it's bigger now than ever before.

Speaker 1:          01:00:59       I don't think so at all. I don't think so at all. I think it's kind of eating itself a little when people going ah, well, like all the comps. Well also one of the guys that worked for him was white, uh, real estate that kind of proved this guy was white who one of the guys in black lives matter. It was white guys. Apparently he's a white guy, allegedly. What the fuck do I know? But the point is that one was particularly agregious that incident with that Eric Gardener Guy. I got disgusted by that. Oh yeah. I was terrible because they all, it was with cigarettes. The guy was selling loose cigarettes. He didn't do anything. And that's the problem with that is that comes from that. It creates, it's sorry, it comes from a place of back. I had to sell loose cigarettes to make a living.

Speaker 1:          01:01:44       Not like he ain't Robin people. He's selling loose cigarettes for a fucking dollar, a piece like the people who can't afford a it. That's not a guy who's wants to dream of that as a job and a career. So it's like, all right, they're poor people and you're saying we have regulations with the government's got to get paid so some guys are able to push you around and they're like, eh, he had asthma, but it's like, why is he fucking big that violent, this beat it. Cops are not supposed to be revenue collector's. Yeah, there's just not that stupid stupid for the cop to be put in that position where you're making them arrest people because you have

Speaker 2:          01:02:19       a quota. Like we have to figure out a way where these people don't. Don't get paid that way. Like the idea that you have to have a certain amount of crime every day in order to keep your position as a cop. That's insane. Like what about a perfect world? What would we employ? A lot of great cops, they become a member of the community respected member because you don't have any fucking crime, so the cop doesn't be a problem anymore. It's not like the old west. Look at them as a thing here because the sheriff's got to. We'll comp. You should look at comps. W it would be ideal, like in a perfect world. Yeah. All the people that were police officers would be the coolest fucking people in the world. They just wanted everything to be cool. Everything to stay calm and in the best case scenario, you live in a world where like we were talking about how little violence there is, imagines that got way better.

Speaker 2:          01:03:10       Imagine if like the Douche douchebag factor got reduced dramatically. What? For whatever way, in whatever way, imagine, imagine how wonderful it would be. The world would be perfect. We wouldn't have. We wouldn't have this fear that people constantly have of getting their home broken into getting their ass kicked or getting in a fight or getting this. We're getting that. All of it could go away, but you can't just fucking choke a guy for cigarettes. You can't do that, you just can't do it the way they slam people's faces into that Shit meant what is it? Because it's written down somewhere. What? It's. There's some, some one decided there's a swath of land and you've got a market cross it. Some people sneak over, they don't have good paperworks. I don't get a good education or you know, this guy's life was like, I don't know if he was an immigrant.

Speaker 2:          01:04:00       I'm making up an immigrant story, but there's so many people that do so many different things in this world because they're trying to get by and the idea that someone would tackle you and choke you just because you're selling loose cigarettes. Like for worse, a ticketable offense if. How about if he's selling stolen cigarettes that he broke into a building that's one thing. Well, this guy, so they told, they told that, uh, whatever, the head cop there was like, no more choke holds. And so he did it anyway. Yeah, he had a PPO, but. So he'll have to choke a guy like that and their defense. But here's the thing, that choke shouldn't kill you. You certainly do. If it's a fight, it wasn't a fight. Exactly in that situation and if he's defending himself, I'm saying the only time you would have to use a chokehold against a person is that if that person is somehow right.

Speaker 2:          01:04:49       So okay, let me just dragging. The guy told them to stop using short codes and use it anyway. Now you have to. If you want to take the gun to the ground. Yeah, but he said the head cop was like, guys, no more of this before this. He was anyway. So if I went and choke somebody and he died and I can say, well, he just had had asthma. What trouble would I be in big time? Manslaughter. Manslaughter, sure. Yeah. Couldn't I couldn't use the excuse. So it depends. Depends on what evidence the guy could be like in this situation. So let's look at this situation because in this situation that guy was totally passive. He didn't do anything wrong. It was ugly. It was ugly. The way they grabbed him. It was ugly. But I'm. What I'm saying is if you want to control a guy who's that big once, once it's a physical altercation, don't wait until he starts punching you or biting you before he choked him.

Speaker 2:          01:05:34       You choke them quick. That's just what you do and I don't. I'm not condoning it in any way, shape or form. I think it was a terrible, terrible miscarriage of of like what's ethically right, what's ethically right. It's not that the people with guns that are employed by the state come after you and drag you to the ground because they're not getting their tax money from you, which is all this loose cigarette thing. And what if the store owner did the exact same thing? Well, what if what you were saying you did, you would have to have a reason to do it. I mean it would have some. It looks like the same reason the cut was like, Hey, I don't want you here. I sell cigarettes in here. I think I was like, I'm just trying to do. And then he just ran up on them, choked him, and then he has asthma made him die.

Speaker 2:          01:06:11       It depends on how it escalates, you know, if you just attacked him, I would say. Yeah man, you just assaulted him for no reason. Like what if, what if he told you to fuck off and then try to sucker punch you and you had to duck under his punch. He didn't do this though. Exactly. He didn't. So then it would be a different story. So in this situation, I mean this wasn't like the store owner didn't do shit. They called the cops, the cops, but it was about a fight because that guy had, he had, there's been a fight before. That's why the cops had showed up. So they showed up. All geared up. Yeah. They showed up geared up because there was an incident and I think this guy might've even called it in. The guy who they wound up killing. Oh No. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:06:49       I don't know exactly what happened, but this dude just happened to be there when it went down. I might be wrong about him calling it in, but he was just there and so they, they come looking for this fight. The fight wasn't there and then they started going after the result of this cop. What's happened to them? I don't know, man. I don't want to single the cop out. I don't even want to mention his name. The other thing is you get offers in trouble. I'm sure he was a cop, right? I was just looking right now, two days ago, accomplished. Charged in this incident in the Eric Garner, a woman, so it's not the one that put him in a choke hold. I mean we could be one of the ones that's in charge of the people that did it. So I'm looking right now though.

Speaker 2:          01:07:26       That's what happens when you're a leader, right? You. That's again, like the club owner and the open miker magic. If you're a sergeant and you're a rookie out there, choke some guy to death and you get in trouble and you get kicked off the force, you lose your cushy job. She's charged right now with failure to supervise an internal charge him that God would failure to supervise. How the fuck is she supposed to supervise? Like these guys choking this guy on the street? Who would it? What is she supposed to do? It's like the losses on the coach is your forearm under his chin? Yes or no? Stop. Let me check your technique. What is she supposed to? New York and there was cops. I remember passing by this cops talking to each other. One was gone and that's not a choke to fucking show. Not a choke.

Speaker 2:          01:08:10       Let me put you in. Got It. And in a. In a hold on his neck. Let me put you in it. No, thanks. I'll choke the shit out of somebody. Anybody tells me that's not a chuck. Let me hold you in like that. Well, what qualifications? You have to be able to say what a choke is. Me? Yeah. Oh, I've got a couple of things. Would you definitely be called an expert? I said it on twitter. I said as a martial arts expert, I even said that it's a professional martial arts expert. I'll tell you very clearly. That's a joke. I will choke the fucking life out of you with that. If I have your head in between my arms, forget me. Okay. How about Eddie Bravo? Listen to me, if Eddie Bravo has your neck and it's trapped in between his arms, you're going to sleep, you're just going to sleep.

Speaker 2:          01:08:51       That's a choke. If he's got your neck like they had eric gardener, you're going to sleep. If Jake she look at this. Come on man. That guy has his finger tucked under his wrist, the hand in the back. He's just got a shitty choke. He's got it. Doesn't have the proper technique for sure. Right, and the other guys hold. He's. He's definitely underneath the guy's Chin though, but this is just a freeze frame. That might've been like a brief millisecond of of struggle, you know, where he was pushing down with his left arm and up with is right. Because if you look at his right arm in this position, that right arm is just an under hook. That's not putting any pressure on his neck. The only thing that's putting pressure on the neck is the left arm. It's under the chin, but there's definitely some space.

Speaker 2:          01:09:31       There's definitely some space between you because it's not under his chin. You see where his chin is like, look at. Make it bigger, real quick, make it bigger. But this is just one picture. If you see where his chin, his back, what happened? Go into your twitter. How dare you? Oh um, but I saw an image where they were like on the ground. Oh really? Yeah. I saw a different image. There it is. See that's. Oh, for sure. That's always got under the neck. That's a fucking 100 percent choke. Choke you to death with one arm like that. If you let me, if you let me get under your Chin like that. Like this guy's letting them. He's not, he's not resisting. He's being what I mean he's letting him and he's in a position where you can't do anything about it, I should say.

Speaker 2:          01:10:18       Even if it doesn't halt, let's say nothing happened to him. You know, he's not, he's not defending it, you know, he's not defending it. It's 100 percent of that guys might, the left guy, he's an aside choke position. So he's pushing down with his left shoulder as well as pulling up with his left hand. And if he puts his left hand on his, on the Guy Eric Gardener shoulder, he uses that as leverage like guys took. Luke rockhold tapped out. Michael Bisping with one arm. Get the okay from the mount position. That's a powerful move. Mean this. It's not exactly this move here, but it's very similar in regards to how much pressure you can put down what your shoulder and how much you can pull up with your, with your arm. That's a fucking choke. Choked the shit out of you. With that. Somebody gets you into like Marcello Garcia. How about Jocko? Ray? Chakra ray gets a hold of you like that. Yeah, that's a fucking choke. You're going to go to sleep and he's not the best in the world. Okay? Don't get me wrong. It's

Speaker 1:          01:11:13       not like the perfect choke. The perfect joke is, you know like a Marcello Garcia rear naked choke where the technique is just so laser sharp. There's a laser. Laser's might not even be sharp. Like in Star Wars, they're not sharp. Really need to watch this guy die. They're fucking with them. Will tell you that. He's like, I didn't sell anything. He didn't even have loose cigarettes on them when they arrested him. Did you know that? No. Nope. Didn't have them.

Speaker 4:          01:11:58       You can tell you Sydney forcibly trying to lock somebody up for breaking up a fight. So yeah, he broke up a fight. The

Speaker 1:          01:12:22       world needs is a mediator. What do you mean stop? Let's press a button on our APP. We have a life mediator show up who's like a really cool dude like the rock. Like I feel like you're the rock could have kept that guy alive. He got there in between the coupler boys, boys, boys relaxed here. Let's talk this through. Let's be rational. Man will regret it in the morning. He'd only have like some motivational shit. Maybe take them to the gym. Everybody does some squats. There's had a show. I think we all did. I think it was where the guy was getting kicked out and they were like, he wouldn't leave. So they call the cops and like you gotta get Outta here. They're gonna arrest. You just leave. Oh yeah. That video made a video of remember. Oh, I don't really. Yeah, there was a video of it. It's not going to rape you. You're small. They're going to rape. You just go. So you don't get raped in prison. You have to go. I'm pretty sure red band got a video of it. Oh really? Yeah. I think he got rid of a video of it and then maybe a video of the guy getting arrested later. Oh yeah. He wouldn't go. He was settled in. Yeah. You never know man.

Speaker 1:          01:13:28       God damage if your life is good. Life is good. But I needed a tank show already landed. What did he talk about? He talked about. He told two stories. So one's gone. Just what's going on. TV They talked about, um, when he was on mad TV doing a bunch of blood while they was supposed to be working. And this is the only life where you can talk about things like that and just casually and it seems funny. Yeah. Whereas if he was an insurance salesman and he was talking to the people, it is counting on talking about your cocaine by the way. New Episodes, February 23rd on comedy central. Oh, season two is he, it season this season dose should say that year. Um, but I, I like what you're doing. Like overall I like what you're doing with your life. I like how you go on these nutty trips.

Speaker 1:          01:14:28       You just take a month and just go somewhere. He went to Thailand for awhile like you do and what it's like you talk to your average stoner who, uh, is a brokester and it's just barely getting by man. If I had fucking money note I do, Dude. I wouldn't even be worried about shit man. I just fucking leave my phone behind. I go to Thailand for a month. I don't give a fuck. I tell my agents suck my dick. I'll be back in 30 days until then. Dale. We have meetings but we have. Fuck you. I'm going to Thailand. Just bring your laptop. Fuck you. So you just decided, you just decided I had to go to Atlanta first issue some to Thailand. So I mailed my phone back to my home. Yeah. Do the one gun. The plant? Yeah. I don't want that. That's how you're supposed to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:15:09       Yeah, it was so much fun. Now you're doing it exactly the right way. Find some shit in a new country. Some crazy noodles. Yeah. Experienced some weirdness. They sell so much Viagra on the streets of Bangkok. Thank God is everywhere. They just look at you. I looked back up, I got. First of all, this is like Viagra. It's such clearly a knockoff. Does it work? I don't know. I wasn't going to try it because they weren't discounted to like a dollar a pill. There was like, there were like half as much as they would have cost and like a store here and that was offensive to you. Look at your face. You're like, excuse me, we're a third world country. My money. There are children working right now and it's 3:00 AM and that's guys six. And He tried to sell me shit. So I think the places should reflect that.

Speaker 1:          01:15:53       Yeah. You don't need a lot of money to get by and Thailand, right? Oh No. Once you're there, you're good. And it's doing everything safe. Thailand's a little more dangerous. China, super safe. Thailand you can get. You can get fucked with a little bit, but it's relatively safe. It ain't like any worse than here. Really. The only thing I gotta worry about a little bit. It's cops more. Oh really? Thailand? Yeah. They probably know more. Tie you up maybe, but yeah, I walked around the streets and shit. Even the small players in the big places. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't really feel any danger. Did you go to Moitai fights? I went to Thai kickboxing fights. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:16:34       Our hair and our hair. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:16:36       They just play this fucking thing the whole time. Yeah. It's annoying sound and they each have a dance of their own. Like Sensei, they have to do this special dance. Have their own Dojo. Well, it's called. I think it's called the white crew. I think that's how they. How they spell it wrong. Yeah, it's pretty dope. They have. Okay, so you just walked down this like you explain what that is. What the whole. The whole little dance because people are like, what the fuck are they talking about? They have to do this. They introduced each person and then as they're both in there. I think that you together

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       maybe one at a time, I'm not really sure. They just do this act out dance where they just sort of like kick a knee up and then do like a fake clench kick and stuff, but just by themselves, not at anybody. And then they do that for a while. They go all the way down to like one knee, but at the same time, these are the hardcore guys. They're doing a lot more of these matches. You see. See this guy's wraps on their hands. They're going to fight bare knuckle. See, this is a, it's not totally bare knuckle. You have wraps, but they're not going to wear gloves and there's quite a few fights they're taking place where guys are fighting like this. Now. I'm wondering if it's an impact of a mma be more popular. Oh really? Yeah, because once I saw how these boxing gloves on because this guy following instagram sand shy, he's a bad motherfucker and he um, he just fought the other night with those gloves on were wraps rather no gloves.

Speaker 2:          01:18:04       And I was like, wow, he's doing those fights like the top, some of the top Thai guys are doing these fights wrapped around their head. It's just sort of like, this is all ceremonial right now. Well it's so, it's not just a spin things with their hands. No, it's also a warmup. See when you watch what he's doing here, when he bends his knee down and picks his foot up, he's stretching his hips, he's stretching. I'm like all the muscles around his upper leg. It's to make it more loose for kicking a. So He's loosening up. See all the power in your kick comes from weight, but it comes from your hips. A lot of it is the swinging of the hips and the engaging of the hips when you throw kicks. So what he's doing is like, it's conducive to warming up that area where you were going to light someone's legs up.

Speaker 2:          01:18:48       They're both doing it. See how they're doing it. It's a warmup to warm up for their own rights. But it's also spiritual. You have to have these, uh, so you're walking down the street and you see an alley. And you just go down the alley and there's just a ring in the middle of it, maybe a pool table and like for like makeshift bars around it, there's like, like, like it almost looks like a lemonade stand at the Rose Bowl, swap meet, you know, and then you just get booze. Some people come around taking bets, like who do you want? Why? Then if you pick the right guy, you can get whatever you want and they'll just pay it off. It is a beautiful art. Yeah. I love Moitai. It's beautiful. But it seemed like that he was doing one legged squats. And when you're doing that, you're just trying to catch them up.

Speaker 2:          01:19:31       Yeah. He's just trying to warm up his hips and they're right next to each other too. And they're about to beat the fuck out of each other. It's so weird. They're all real respectful. Yeah. I didn't see any. So I went to a couple of different ones that he's weird promoters. This is just back alley things. Then they just get like 50 people to show up. Well they, they, they are the same way though. Even when they're world champions, really, really interesting. Yeah. I've seen world championship fights with the two fighters get, but I've also seen animosity. I watched his fight in La were bookout was fighting this guy and blue cow, I think his name was par permit. It's like their name, the part of their name is what their gym that they're fighting out of, but I think is his actual name is bull cow.

Speaker 2:          01:20:15       I think I. I'm not sure either way. He's a bad motherfucker like a world champion. World class tie fighter. And he fought this dude who was really disrespectful to him. So he did this like very violent and aggressive dance towards him. Really? Yeah. It was very different. It's very different than I'd ever seen before. Or He'd like launched arrows, Adam and shit and like had all this choreographed, but it was like directed towards this guy. Then they fought and he fucked him up. He lit him up. He shut the arrows out of and also fucked them up. Well, he fake shot the arrows during his dance, but when they thought he fucked up, he was like, I felt the trash he. Well blue cows on. He's on a very high level as a tie fighter and there's a lot of fighters who were maybe aggressive and athletic and they hit really hard and they overestimate their ability and they just think they're a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          01:21:08       They've knocked a bunch of guys out cow, they're going to knock this mother fucker out too. Like people have this idea in their head, but you get in there with that guy and you realize like, oh, okay, this. I can't even hit him and he's. Every time I move he's killing my legs. Every time I come close to him, his knee is getting burned into my rib cage. He's elbowing me in the head on the brake and then smiling at me and doing it all over again. He's going to keep doing it. Your body's gonna start breaking down and that's what happened. He just started beating the fuck out of this dude. Like those guys were getting a little aggressive there. Yeah, it was. He got in the way of, this is what lasts way longer than anything I saw. These guys love each other. I think. I think they're gonna start making out. I think Jamie just tricked us into watching some gay porn that's gonna start off. That's why I didn't have gloves on each other with those things.

Speaker 2:          01:21:57       So, um, but yeah, like I saw probably 10 fights the first time. And then in Chiang Mai I probably saw another. I saw another probably seven, eight fights. What was the fight where you and Duncan were in the crowd at the UFC and you timed it perfectly. Don't know. Fighting Nate Marquardt and Brad Tavarez Powell from memory. I remember that. My wife was telling me some shit yesterday. I'm like, you never said that. Meanwhile she totally talked for like 10 minutes about it. Really put nate Marquardt versus breadth devops in the memory banks. There's this, that's it. Nate Marquardt, Brad Tavarez, and then we're sending that. They get close and when the camera came to them they made out like a frosted dying, dying dare you. How dare you. So we're starting to throw it. We started throwing a Illuminati signs up for Illuminati side. We made a big one with my whole forearm and his forearm and his both giant triangles and then he goes at some point in buckets like we kept taking it up a notch at some point that just leads to me and he goes, you know, we got a kiss right mother

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       fucker here. Right? So I'm watching a fight and Duncan staring at the monitor the whole time, just staring, waiting for it to come on us. And then at some point she goes, now I just had to turn and start making out and we got to be careful about that folks, but get me in trouble. Oh, I know the. He didn't even care. They thought it was funny to interrupt me. The next day is an animal. He doesn't give a fuck. I didn't know. Met Me. He goes, you to acquit the social media stars.

Speaker 6:          01:23:33       Morning,

Speaker 1:          01:23:37       get in a bad thing. It's funny you didn't do anything wrong, but Dana is a regular person for having a guy who's the president of,

Speaker 6:          01:23:51       Oh my God, so stupid. We're children. We're at 40 Ortiz.

Speaker 1:          01:23:58       Fuck is wrong with me. Other people, he thinks legit thing that he's in the Illuminati sign worshiper because I went to that a performance that he did at that guy's funeral or a funeral funeral. This is where my mind was already out of the wedding fund. Remember someone's wedding? It was one of the levators Anton Anton Mulvey's. We went to that doctor. He performed it at one of his like for birthday parties of the dead grandfather. Oh really? How to show that wasn't there for that one, but dunking Hobo. Yeah, it was. It was so bizarre. It was just so strange that I ran into a bunch of people I knew there to. Really? Yeah. Oh, you guys are quite the sickness. So. Well they weren't really satanist, like thought of him was hired so day Foley's wife at the time. Oh yeah. I was like, Oh hey, what's up?

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       She was there. It was a bunch of people who didn't. We run into some other comics there too. I wasn't at the wedding. He didn't go to their wedding. It was just me and Duncan and joey. Joey went. He probably went to. Yeah, we were like, what the fuck is this? Wasn't some party, wasn't necessarily. It was a wedding. It was like six. I don't know. Whatever. I met a guy third was there too. That's. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, I didn't get to meet him. I like his music. It's really crazy. Yeah. And he was the country roots to. Oh deep. He was awesome. And that was wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia. It was a good movie. Holy Bread. Next. Oh my God. But he was great in it too, you know, I can. He's like helping narrate it and talk to the uh, the JESCO, the dancing outlaw. Watch a fucking awesome, awesome. Strange people. They run shit too. Huh? Well, sort of. I mean they're only getting arrested for the boys. They're the real duke. The Duke Boys are supposed to be like these heart of gold moonshiners don't want to fuck their cousin. I'm not buying it. I would be like, really? Look at this bitch.

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       She's nobody's fucking daisy. Okay. She can't get a goddamn boyfriend. She's running around because she likes she us. She likes cletus. She could. She make it more obvious that she's cut the legs off or shorts. You could just finger her swing. She's there for you. She's letting me know she's hacking in shorts like no girl ever, ever done that ever. Even now it's like God damn. And she was doing it when no one was doing it and she was wearing a men's shirts like she just got done. Fucking touch a man's shirt on like your shirt. She could be wearing your shirt down to the fifth button. Tied off on the bottom. Ted, come on son. She's got a man's shirt on. Why is that super hot girl? Have almost no man. That ain't number one. Bonus number two bolts here. You. You don't even know your history. So we're the number two bolts, right? Right, right. That's him and it's been a while. Tom Wolf Pac man, that hair. Those are the number two's no, these are still people go god, look at those shorts. Christ. She was hot pink. This makes me nervous. Just looking at her. You can see their fucking junk in their pants. Yeah, they're dicks was hard as rock. Oh my God. And they're not even related to her because not only does she have camel toe on that she's got of the beginning of one. Just the beginning of badge. Outline everything. You could see the slice. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:27:26       They had grandma panties back then. Oh, guess who doesn't care me? Are you a panties guy? What do you mean when you like. I like when girls with dogs don't like granny panties. I think my girlfriend, nothing. Say it. Somebody got constraining yourself. So they were moonshiners with a heart of gold but never got any pussy.

Speaker 2:          01:27:51       And they were beautiful man. Beautiful Man. And they're hot cousin. It was a show where no one fucked. It was the most ridiculous world. That was way more ridiculous in the fact that they were shooting with lightening with a dynamite at the end of it. And they didn't have guns because they did time for fucking running moonshine. But the man should let them do what they do down here in Hazard County. We got our own rules and that was nobody. Nobody fucked. Yeah. You think fucking boss hog would have had a slew of hookers. She should have all that show now in reality like this is what it would be like. Well, let's think about her. She was the only hot girl in the show ever. Look who she should have two dudes, one of the grossest women of all time. That's his wife. How dare you. How dare you.

Speaker 2:          01:28:36       He would have been choosing a wonderful woman in the greatest killer fucking or he would have been fucking her uncle Jesse would've fucked. Everybody was fucked up. Cletus scooter, boss Hog definitely would've. He would've had her on the payroll. She'd been riding right next to him. That cadillac with the bull horns and the front of it, but she came on to the other guy. Oh, he was always coming on as gay as fuck, and he was comfortable it because Jesus was strong in his life. That's why cletus didn't want to admit it. That's now. That's them. Now. Show me now. Don't, don't do it. Don't do it to meet Jamie should kill this thing. You were watching television now. Oh, look at her sitting up.

Speaker 2:          01:29:13       Her legs were so hot. Just ridiculously high watching just watching TV now, but here's what's crazy about that show. It was. I mean, was there another girl on the show ever besides like old ladies? Maybe she had a rule and the contract. She could be the only hot one, like listen, benches. I don't think there was ever another really. I watched it. If I was running the dukes of Hazzard, okay. This is why I'm not an executive producer. The dukes of hazzard. I would say, okay, why do we only have one hot check? You guys out of your fucking mind. We need a Baywatch. This motherfucker. I know it turned into porn. If you were running it through seasons, they be like, let's just say, hey bob, it's a comedy folks. You should have more funny hot girls in the background doing other shit. Maybe run another alternative storylines and you have a plot and a b plot.

Speaker 2:          01:30:01       This is the problem with how they would. As soon as you get some fucking he now you're like, let's put some more hot women that Sitcom. No, no, no, no. I'm trying to diversify. I'm thinking of Hot Indian woman. That's what I'm thinking, really hot Indian woman, you always, you think you're going to get. It's that close to happening and she showed me the smuggling shipment of Jello and two of them have to. You have some sort of battle. Let's just make sure that punches up when we write this together. Yeah, you don't want to be white. Everyone will be at chop. We make fun of white men especially. Let's punch up. Okay. It's important or somebody recommends me in a, in an island in Thailand, said Eddie Bravo. He takes Muay Thai class there. Instead of the problem was going to teach a seminar. Coast time we.

Speaker 2:          01:30:46       He was going to teach us out. He was like, please tell Eddie Bravo. Well, what are you have messenger for? Improper? Why another motherfucker get on twitter like everybody else? Oh yeah, come on to the Internet. How dare he try to use you? How about just say hello man? He told me what? You have a task. What am I a carrier pigeon. You Fuck? What am I a raven? You want to tie something to my ankle? I go back home and teach me how to like get the fucking kickup on my scooter. I was like, how do you fucking. He goes, Ari Shapiro. I'm like, yeah. Like, hey, how do you kick the scooter thing out? And it goes here. Let me show you until Eddie Bravo to come out here. That would actually be really hot. If you had a like a girl who was like a super hot girl who would carry a message to you, taped to her ankle and then became a service like a mess, a messenger. How do you know how like, um, maybe like you would hire someone to be a clown at a birthday party or someone to show up at your dance, a show up at your office rather and do a dance for you on your birthday. You know, somebody's got you a dance. Graham did have debt today. Instead of that, you have hot girls show up like ravens with a note attached to their ankle and they have to put their leg up on your desk and untie the note and give it to you in some weird

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       sorta semis job situation. And you read this little scroll that someone had written out like old timey back go away, but just kind of how you can you have a immediate one of those wax seals at the stamp, like absolute broken? Of course. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. A wax seal around her ankle. Like just some maybe. Maybe a little hot wax got honor. Oh, I love fail in this message. That was the test. I like it. I like being a little. Maybe not hurt me. That would be a new service. How much would you pay? $5 extra. Well, what I'm thinking is probably more. Let's just concentrate on ballers. Let's just. When we move into bel air and Beverly Hills where all these fuckheads are driving million dollar cars and we just start running to the forum, Miss Yoga Slavia fucking uprising in our country. Let's get crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:32:54       Let's say each message cost it costs a thousand dollars. Should deliver a message in Los Angeles in that style and that style. $1,000 plus tips. But you've got to make sure that girls don't become hookers. He doesn't just become. I know you've already done it. I have 30,000 more if you'll come on into my castle. How long have you been working for this agency? You have so much harder than all the other girls who ever listen. You don't need this shit. How? Sit down. I'll call them. Have a drink with me.

Speaker 2:          01:33:42       if you heard real talk. I heard it a long time ago. Maybe the greatest song. Humanity's ever done a whole video series. Everything amazing. Oh, the trapped in the closet. You're thinking of the traps and closet? Yeah. Traveling clause was pretty deep or a real top was. The other thing, real talk was one song was one, one song in one music video art Kelly, so he went a little crazy too. Then came back. Keep. You didn't do anything, man. Nothing happened. Having to compete on a girl like girls like 14 r Kelly is 40 more chapters of this isn't real. No. Oh my God. That sounds like the onion. R Kelly has 40 more chapters of trapped in the closet planned. He's amazing. I hope it never dies. Wow. I really hope he lives forever. He might be my favorite person. We'll talk. There's a specific kind of crazy that's famous.

Speaker 2:          01:34:35       Crazy. No one will ever tell you they'll be this crazy. Let's be honest. It's also a black, famous, famous crazy. Couldn't pull that off. A white guy. I can't wear a clock around your neck and act like it's normal. If you're black guys can pull off way more extravagant, you know, like, this isn't racist. I'm just being. I'm just being real with you. People says the guy with the sumo sword on his desk, so when he gave it to my fucking racist, how dare you? Misappropriate culture. Oh my God, you're a terrible person. I always knew you were racist. You hide behind the fact that you're a Jew. I'm so persecuted. Let me be racist. Get the camera. Zoom. Oh, the fat guy says, Oh God, you changed the game and Sumos you might've just made sumo. Amazing. Made irrelevant again. The most amazing thing ever.

Speaker 2:          01:35:29       Just watching guys go to war. Okay, how about that guys going to war? Not Allowed to stamp through. The body begins to come apart, so guys would usually be covered with scars. All the fat will be pouring it. Get sliced. Open shields. No, fuck them. No. The belly shield at least make it like Dole swords. No swords. How about like, okay, what if you were playing like with lightsabers, right? But the light sabers just shocked you. Oh, but like a heavy, like heavy shock. Yeah, like a Taser, right? Like a Jason Ellis type shock. Yeah. Yeah. Lightsabers. Yeah. Imagine if that was the sport. Oh my God. I might have just invented the perfect sport. By the way. Jason Ellis run with this. Yeah, go for it dude. For Real. I'll give it to you. Yeah, go ahead. I'll even help. Do they have lightsaber tasers? They should.

Speaker 2:          01:36:26       If they don't, they're retarded dude. If I was a girl and a rapist came at me and I had a taser, I'd be like, Oh fuck. But if I had a taser lightsaber I'd be like, you're probably not going to continue with this, but you're fucked. You're going to get outta here. Yeah. Yeah. Any one can touch you with something like a lightsaber, like they might be able to. Well, depends on who you are. Obviously if you're Steven Seagal, he'll figure it out. He'd be able to block it, flip you. You never touch him with any part of. You touched it shocks you. Yeah. You'd have to just touch their feet like fake. You're going logo high, fake. You're going high at all. Any sort of block out. It would be. Well, anybody who knows fencing for sure you would fuck you up. Like fencers would be the most dangerous people ever on earth.

Speaker 2:          01:37:06       Well imagine if you had one. It was small and you could press a button like you do with a lightsaber. A rod extends. Yeah, like a metal rod because they have those things like those Bhutan's the press a button and it becomes a steel Bhutanese Rod. Yeah. Dude, why we 12? What's wrong with us grown men, we pay taxes. So you would press a button and it would just become electrified. Yeah, that totally seems like it would be a real thing. Wow. Yeah. They probably have that in development, right? How did they not? If they don't, they do. Now. The Batman should have that. Fuck. You should have that. Superman was still fucking him up. That's why this movie stupid. I don't care what anybody says. Who supermoon who would burden moon. Just going to put crypt to modal overlays. Bodie into superman is going. Go and make the world spin backwards so that Batman doesn't get the fucking Kryptonite suit dummy to make the world spin backwards.

Speaker 2:          01:38:03       Only has to do is stay like 100 feet away from Batman. He could find that when I got the Kryptonite just keeps spinning backwards. So it was like a month ago. He would just pick up cars and throw them at Batman till he died to stop. Well, he's not trying to kill him because he's all good, but if he wanted to he could. Yeah. That's the idea. Right? Everybody's. You don't get it, bro. Batman always wins. Listen, bitch. I met an evil. Listen Bitch. Even if he's evil, the other guy's bulletproof. Shut the fuck up. He's an alien. Did. Do you remember when we were saying people just get angry right now? You don't even fucking understand comic books. When I did an instagram post about that, oh my God, people were so mad at me. Why are you taking the fear factor? Go seriously? Why are you taking me books?

Speaker 2:          01:38:51       Yeah, that's right there. We don't know about the subject that you just said. I don't know about. I barely barely know something about comic books almost for Star Wars. All the superhero movies were exactly the same. Yeah. They don't look good. We got to pull power back. We gotta you gotta check in. We got to know a bunch of powers. The kid gets mad. Other superheroes, like I'll help pull pulled over powers back. Superhero fight. It was like it was. It was more than one preview, right in star wars was that same movie. The last avengers felt really stale. Really? Yeah, because I saw it right after the machine or what is it? X X, x, x market, which was excellent. If you haven't seen x Maki. Now it's a movie about artificial intelligence and it is beautiful. It is a perfect movie. I wouldn't change a thing about that movie was so good.

Speaker 2:          01:39:47       The ending wasn't like boring and long. No, no, no, no, no. That movie was amazing. That movie was like, Whoa, because the reality of these things have this artificial intelligence is guide created was fucking feasible. Really? Yeah. It was good. It's really good though. The dramas good. The whole thing is good. It's just so good and then after that I went to see the vendors. I was like, this is so stupid. I'm like, this movie is so dumb. It's just like I'm watching the Dukes of hazzard take place with superheroes. It's just was like. It didn't mean anything. Yeah. Like X, Mokena. Everything meant something like the. These people, their interactions, the other interactions felt we'll the. There's some real palpable tension. There's a real danger that they're being played by these artificial creatures that they've created that look exactly like people. It's good, man. It's good. That's why star wars to me, it was like, ah, whatever. I Love Star Wars. It was just like a b minus fun movie. A plus a plus. Not No real. There's five stars. I'll 10 times. I loved it. I did love it man. I have, I think almost exact opposite. Tastes in movies. A lot of music to you, like a Sucky, sucky selection of music.

Speaker 6:          01:41:05       You like the chip rock that I like about it?

Speaker 2:          01:41:12       No, no. I like a little Noli. She's got a beautiful voice.

Speaker 6:          01:41:20       Hey,

Speaker 2:          01:41:21       when I mentioned to read and you were like, hey, who's the girl you were talking about? Dude, I picked up Eddie Bravo once and this girl that he was dating way back in the day and I had Cheryl crow playing in my truck. Uh, and uh, she's like, why are you playing this if it makes you upset? I'm like, this is mine. This is mine. She goes, no, it's not. I go, yeah, it's a CD. I got it. The CD. It's like, no, you do not listen to this music. I'm like, but I do. So I don't know where we're going with this.

Speaker 2:          01:41:55       Never spoke to her again. How rude. Rude. Eddie Bravo. Bringing these barbarians around. Yeah. You can't like chuck rock. Otherwise there's some kind of a pussy. Yeah, it's weird. I don't care. I used to have my cds a alphabetized and I would have them separated by cic singers and male singers. Have you ever heard of Grace Potter and the nocturnals heard of them? Haven't listened to that girl's got. Oh boy. So you know about Alabama shakes, right? No. Oh, well let's, let's kiss one another. There is so much bigger, but yeah, that's great. Spotter. Yeah, they're pretty big now. Yeah, I think she's pretty big too. We don't know dude. We're out of the loop. I know. I know. Alabama shakes. You've heard it. She didn't even have a phone. You got some fucking 1980 Morris code thing in your pocket. I didn't even get. It doesn't even vibrate when I get a text.

Speaker 2:          01:42:48       It's in my phone if my pocket. I don't even know if people texted me and then I was like, where are you? And it isn't like, oh, I don't know. It was walking. Oh God. That's hilarious. Yeah. I got to only vibrate when it rings and that's it. Yeah. I wouldn't only notification. I went to a clusterfuck when my phone upgraded and went from text messaging to sending messages and then I turned the I message off, but then people were still sending me ims juice that was getting them on my computer, but I wasn't getting them on my phone. I'm like, this is so stupid. Like this system is so goofy. Like how do you opt out of this? How do you just. I want everything in one place. I don't need it going every. I don't need to be getting phone calls on my fucking computer when I'm.

Speaker 2:          01:43:31       When I put my phone over there, I want to be able to get like the voice mails later. I don't want to see it on my computer when I'm working, so what do I have to do now? I have to disable this and I've got. Why is this set there by default? Why is my phone making my computer ring by the fuck? Can I get some shit done? God dammit. Ari Shaffir. It's always infringing. It's always infringing in your day. Ken Did the ball. Go check twitter. It's been four minutes. Listen, what if there's no response to ball? He'll resistances, few tile independence, which is my real thing. I think it's getting better, but I don't think we've developed an etiquette around phones yet. You say that until you have four legs. Every girl wants to get that for less. Girls don't even know why. Something about them for legs just looks up. It didn't get way easier.

Speaker 7:          01:44:22       Jim. I'll just say what about, uh, the twitter news of the weekend where they might be changing some free spirits, free speech, stuff that pulled away verification from.

Speaker 2:          01:44:32       Well, they pull away Milo Yiannopoulos verification for bold. Is Verification Away why they said that? Well, they don't say exactly violation of terms of service. So now he's no a verified. Exactly. But he's still allowed to post. So there's some posts are saying if it's offensive or the, your account, right? Well they did not see. He's not being any more like here's a problem with that guy and it's not a bad problem. He's funny and a lot of what he's doing is theater like. And if he gets you riled up, especially if he has a point. And I think he has a point with a lot of things he's picking on, you know, he's not dumb. He's very smart and so he's getting people riled up like a professional troll. It was also a very bright guy who writes some pretty good articles and I would say really good art.

Speaker 2:          01:45:19       What is someone who writes for Breitbart? He's like, he's hilarious. He's a conservative writer. He's a conservative, I guess a blogger, I guess we'd call them. You wouldn't say he's a journalist. He's more of a, you know, he writes editorials, writes just pieces. Right. But he's also gay, like gay as fuck and conservative and he goes into debates with these feminists and just crushes them with facts and they can't attack him because he's gay. He has the, he has the sketch down card, he's got this weird loophole and he knows what the fuck he's talking about. Yeah. I mean I don't agree with them on some things, but he's a very bright guy. So when he finds someone that he can pick on, especially like he's really into picking out feminists and calling them out on their hypocrisy and picking on people that just an eight minute he'll, he'll go across the board with anybody if he thinks you're being ridiculous and he makes a big deal out of it.

Speaker 2:          01:46:12       So then what people got mad at what he was saying. Well, he'll say, I don't know, you know, he'll say things to rile people up. They'll say offensive things, but guess what, you block them. I think it's, I think it's enjoyable. Like I would think it's fun. Twitter becomes weird where it's like you have a bunch of followers who follow you. You say something funny on the offensive side instead of on the cute side, um, you'll get retweets if some cute side or if it's A. Yeah. So now the retweets go to people who don't follow you and they might not even know who you are. And then go like, what the fuck is that supposed to mean? Who's this guy, you know? And they don't see any context. They don't say it's one out of 10 tweets in a row about a subject. Uh, so then they see it. Then they get mad and they flag

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       it, and then the people don't know, like, I don't know. It's been flagged 7,000 times. I guess people are mad at this guy. We got to band them. Well, yeah. Especially as a terrible road to go down if there's, if you're doing a series of, of show one, it's like, oh, you're not even looking at the context. Exactly. Yeah, that can definitely. They took away his verify and not be verified. Here's what I'm saying. They fucked up because now you have even made him a martyr. Like you'd go, you're, you're playing right into a spiderweb. Why is twitter getting involved in any level of celebrity? Which he seems like he is. If was a known writer, then he's a known. He's. He was great on the podcast. Really? Yeah, he's hilarious. He's, he's a nut. He, I, you know, like I said, I don't agree with them about a lot of things, but I like what he's doing.

Speaker 1:          01:47:33       It makes me laugh. Like he's. What is the difference when he was doing what he's doing and what a lot of like, funny humorous journalists have done, but what about this evidence? You say something Ernest, that I think is like offensively wrong and anti free speech and it gets me angry. I don't try to get them banned from it. Yeah. I don't mind but I don't mind because it hasn't effect my mind. I just don't want to stop them from saying it. I mean it hasn't affected me on a professional level and if it has, it's my fault, you know, anything that I've ever been affected by it. Like if I made a mistake because it's clearly been my fault, I've made definitely some errors, but I think there's a difference between like I think what, what decisions for them to make them for you.

Speaker 1:          01:48:17       Well bothers. You don't want to. Getting back to that guy in Vancouver, uh, that had to pay 15 grand. What bothers me about any, any interaction between two people that like one person said something rude or whatever. Who knows what exactly went down. That money starts being a thing that's thrown around because then the government gets their piece too, by the way. Right. So they're on the side of like, sure, you should be able to sue them. They also get their piece because of the trial, like these court costs. Everything has to get factored in. I don't know exactly how it works in Canada, but if it was in the United States, Mike Ward isn't serious. He's, he's had a lot of money in his own and his own lawyer fees because he's fighting it. He has cash. He's like a, he's like a well known French Canadian comic.

Speaker 1:          01:49:00       So he has this whole, like French Canadian tour. You can do. Which one was he with? Mike Ward is the one with um, what you were talking about it earlier, but the kid who had some diseases and he made a joke about that. Yeah. Okay. And it was a bit had but like he's got to pay all his legal fees and try to win this and he could pay the 80 grand the sooner for. But he's like, then that sets such a terrible precedent. So we just in his own battle on free speech saying, I don't want to lose this for what it means. It's fucked. I mean it's people like full qm have said that joke. That's bullshit. Of course he should have got laughs. A bunch of labs. He said it enough times where was a is a winning bit and his act. Yeah. And you can't decide that you can't take.

Speaker 1:          01:49:44       Well obviously they can, but you should be able to take money away from people like that. Yeah, I mean you might want to say you don't want to ever go to one of his shows again. I'm not going to chick fil a, the guy who supports, you know, anti gay stuff. Okay. There you go. That's how you speak with your own dollar. Exactly. Let, let the market decide. No, I think that's a, that's the appropriate way to the fucking directors. That guy who did, who did pan's labyrinth, whammo dealt garbage now how dare you. So then it's like, once you realize that, but it's like he used to be cool, but now it's like fucking awful. And it's just talking. He's gone sour, so then it's like I just won't watch them anymore, but of course go make whatever you want to make in. Well, I wouldn't say went sour.

Speaker 1:          01:50:32       I still like it stuff. You'd like the hobbit that he wrote just like that last movie. You didn't like it. The last movie he didn't like it. It looked like it was an acting class thing. Was it? It was just like there was no acting. You the cabin thing or you think you are main wounds. I mean I was probably pretty high, but God, it was such terrible acting and no plot and just like, wait, wait, wait. I'll show you some special effects and a little. Did you yell out? Know what? I did leave. Did you? I left quietly. Wow. Me and the girl I was looking for eventually we were like. It was like we both realized we were both wanting to leave for about 25 minutes and then I was like, hey, let's just go here. Maybe you just want to get your freak on. Do. Do you like that movie, that new movie made? Did you really do you have.

Speaker 1:          01:51:17       I'm not even going to bring up the what the American side because I'm afraid of it because it's say, but no boots. Bring that up. Let's bring that up. Because I saw it. So tell me you didn't like it. It wasn't a good movie. It wasn't a good movie. It wasn't a good movie. This is the thing. No development. Exactly. I never get to like him, so now he's having trouble sleeping. Suddenly it's good. Again, whites is where it's a scene in their subject matter is highly charged and very, very sensitive to people. So anything that's thought of in disrespect of Chris Kyle, people automatically get up in arms for. I completely understood talking about his book and I'm like, I don't know. I didn't read any that I saw this fucking awful movie. I, yeah, I completely understand people's position in respecting him as a guy who kept people safe over there.

Speaker 1:          01:52:01       I understand where they're coming from. His wife, half the movie when he's in battles. Very angry, but I was going to say it's just not well done. No, it's not well done. It's not just not that well done. I mean, it's just my opinion. I just felt like it was flat and this is like, here's a good comparison. I, I hate to beat a dead horse, but I'm x Mokena Ipa, watch x Maki now and watch that movie. There's a way that it's shot. There's a way the story's told that story is a very compelling story. It's kind of a crazy story. That countdown was a good move. That was like, whoa. Clipping and fucking yes. Exacerbating the Chris Kyle counselor, you know, would've been fucking. Ryan was great. How about tell the truth about Chris Kyle's life like in towards the end

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       where he was involved in that Jesse Ventura thing, which is really kind of crazy where he's making up a story about a fight with Jesse Ventura. That never happened. So Jesse Ventura sued him and won and then after he won, he, he, he got Chris Kyle got killed and Jesse Ventura got all these death threats because you want to continue to it. Well, it wasn't that much of a year before he died. It was just some guy who's lying about me. Well, I think you can be both. Yeah. Yeah. This is where things get really confusing. Jackson rapes boys. I don't think he did. I think he just jerked off in front of him and shit, stuff like that. Maybe he was raping them. I just feel like that would have got out. Yeah, maybe you're right. I think it was just parties and like maybe stroke, but definitely inappropriate boners.

Speaker 2:          01:53:34       If he could get one. He got one. I mean during that time period. I mean he's got to find time to jerk off unless he's jerking off in the shower, you know, touching it. These kids, they're over the house all the time and they're sitting in his lap and you know, just blood. They're sensitive tissue side. His fault or my fault. He didn't. I mean it's just love. Everyone's so sensitive. It's just love. God. Well, could just be beautiful. Cup of listening to Ben. Exactly down. Oh yeah. Good Times. I'm the one in the room with macaulay.

Speaker 2:          01:54:14       Anyway, I got on that. How do we go that? We just, I just went with it. What we're talking about somebody that you can be two things at once, it doesn't mean he wasn't a hero. Artists. Those saved. Yeah, we'll think about what he did. Right. There was a great sniper saved American citizens that were over there fighting in the war against other people that were fighting against American citizens. The way. Hold on, sorry. Sorry. Draw your conclusion about who's right or who's wrong. Get that out of your head and he was trying to protect his friends. Right, so whether or not you think that he should be on this team or that team or this team is bad and that team's good. We'll put all that aside. He kept a bunch of people live. Those people came back. Whether or not you think they should come back, whether or not you think that she'd ever been in there in the first place.

Speaker 2:          01:54:58       He definitely helped countless. I mean it's probably actually probably if this movie is about the French sniper or about sniper, the world doesn't exist. It's was not a good movie. Yeah. It's not a good movie he ever took was like 2000 yards. I don't remember the numbers anymore and then, and then he hurts. So and so Mustafa was getting shocked that long. He's like, it's possible I've shot that, but that's the longest I've ever shot. And then when he shoots him at the end, it's twice as far as the longest shot he's ever heard of it can't even see the guy. You just see a blur. And he goes, I know it's him. It must be. I have a feeling. Yeah. And then it goes, Yup. Got Them. You can't even see them, you know, made the twice as long as any shot that's ever been recorded without being able to see it.

Speaker 2:          01:55:40       You just know you have you made it. Yeah. You need a spotting for 200 yards. You know, people look at as target that's 200 yards away spotting scope to see where you're hitting on the target. Cause like it's not that good to see how the scope. Like you're a rifle scope from 200 yards, which is nothing. So like two football fields. It was just. So here's, here's the question though, is it also a factor of you're telling a real person's story with his little variation from the truth as possible over at an acceptable period of time, a two hour movie or whatever it is. It's fucking hard to do, but they didn't do a good job of it. They did a terrible job of it, but it would've been incredibly difficult to do even if it did a great job. And let's just back up a second.

Speaker 2:          01:56:25       I'm best actor. Yeah, that. That's not real. I mean, come on. He looked like he could tell what he was doing lines where he was hit a rubber baby and I knew that. Forget to rubber baby, but he's moving the rubber baby with his fingers and thumb. You can go fuck yourself. Okay. I'm not a kid. What did you do on a magic trick that I can see who and were going to stick this into my hand and you're shoveling in your wrist at the same time. My thumbs coming apart, bulging your shirt at the fucking Hanky. Still sticking out a little bit what? God. Even in the beginning when he finds his, his girlfriend and the other guy, those are out there having that talk and he's drinking a beer. It's like, dude, come on. You're not even a real person. This is acting class.

Speaker 2:          01:57:05       I can see you doing lines, but he's not a real person. He's behaving in this incredible, exemplary way. Like a hero. He's in practice. He's a beautiful hero. He's not perfect hero and we can't believe he's gone. I mean, that's what he's a hero. He's in a fight with his girl and he stands up and they're like, you're just tell that the directors in the background, feel it more. Not. Feel it more. Yeah. Let this hit you. You love America because it's happening to you. Feel it more. What's the problem? Whenever you try to dramatize anything, you know that movie Fox catcher is a clusterfuck of lies. Really movie that's based on Mark Schultz and David Schultz, sort of Olympic wrestlers. They were a very famous American Olympic champion wrestlers. They were both beasts and there was this crazy guy named John Dupont and John Dupont had a lot of money, so like the dupont name and he was a crazy man and he wanted to wrestle, so he hired all these guys and built an incredible world class training facility and paid them and these guys were struggling wrestlers.

Speaker 2:          01:58:04       They went down there and uh, one of the guys, Dave wound up getting murdered by dupont and it was just crazy store and Steve Carell played him in the movie, but the movie, although it was a good movie, the reality was way off, way off. Like they changed the timeline of the UFC. They stayed, they had to the UFC existing like way, way before it did. I'm less concerned with that than if it's a movie then, unless they say it's like a actual biography. Yeah. I'm less concerned with that than, than if a like narcos. I'm like, know some of this is based on truth. Some of this, just like they didn't know the relationship with this guy in this because they didn't have to fake that historic data. Did they figure because they're idiots? What benefits of this plot? It's somebodies thinks they're smarter than everyone who's going to know the truth, which is the dumbest thing too, to think.

Speaker 2:          01:58:51       You should never think if you're going to talk about a subject like the UFC, which to a person like you, I know you're a fan and definitely into. You know when it starts offensive as fuck. When you try to pretend it started a different date. Then when you watch him watch on television, watch big daddy goodrich fight, but then when he fights in the movie, he fights them. White Russian guy. Bullshit. He fought big daddy goodrich. Mark Schultz fought big daddy good. Which I watched it. He beat his ass. He took him down at will and I remember watching it going, Jesus Christ, this is what happens when you get elite Olympic gold medalists, world champion wrestlers. Like I was thinking to myself, who the fuck is going to keep that guy off of them? That could have been a world champion for sure. He nobody wanted to know.

Speaker 2:          01:59:33       He was in the UFC, fought big daddy goodrich in the UFC, but there was no money back then and he had a Gig with a. He was teaching wrestling at a college and not paid more. What was coach a wrestling coach? Like a university gig. I mean he's a really respected wrestler and they didn't want him cage fighting, so they told him like this is it, like you have to make a decision. So he had to go with the the obvious job because there was no money in the UFC back then is fucking really dangerous. But they changed in the movie. They had them fighting in some unknown organization. It wasn't the UFC and the guy was a white Russian guy who was fighting like, hold on, let me ask you a question. Could this be the reason they changed it? Because what the UFC means right now is like this massive thing.

Speaker 2:          02:00:12       So they'd go, well viewers, if they saw this like, yeah, you have. See that's really big. I would give up UFC where you're like, no, no, you need to be in the place. Back then, this was just a rogue thing. People just did it to mix. You know what I mean? I see what you want to have. Cursing in deadwood. It's like, yeah, they didn't have that then, but you're not gonna understand the cursing they actually had. Did they have cursing back then? They had like rapscallion and shit, so he wouldn't hit as hard as it as an scallion, so they had to change the reality to make it the feeling of the issue. Imagine if you were doing a comedy show in the wild west and someone tried to heckle you, fucking go to that guy. What kind of damage you could do to them with the cursing I have now rapscallion, you're a cunt.

Speaker 2:          02:00:56       You fucking bitch. Well, you're anchored out of here. Fuck boy. Here. You're angry and it's not even a real person. We're talking about. It all worked up, man. Fucking pea pea shooter, motherfucker. She was Christ peter, Rusty Stirrup, cunt. And then he brings you in front of the tribunal and you have to give up three pieces of gold. Fucked up. Three pieces of gold, gold shift here. What it's going to happen, man. Are we going to go bitcoin? You think I've got to get Antonopoulos back on. It's been awhile. I don't know. Probably. Tell me again. I'll. I'll believe them again. By the time I come back here in two. You don't know how to spend bitcoin. How to spin it. Spend it. Spend it. Hm. That's a problem. If you don't know how to spend your money, probably look into it, but if you don't have this ancient fucking phone, you have to be plugged

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       into your laptop, but some sort of Ethernet cable, don't ya? You got some 19 seventies laptop too. Don't you fuck. Come on. Book pro. That doesn't even have a USB port, does it? Which one doesn't have a USB port? Do they have one that doesn't? Don't have CD drives anymore? No. One of them doesn't even have a USB port. There's a real skinny one of the air. No, it's not even the air. It's like it's not the air. Google that shit son. Don't have them. I know that. Yeah. I pads don't have USB ports, which was USB port. USB is where you would plug things in, you know like if you were trying to sync your phone up to it or something like that, plug your phone by USB or if you want to save something on a drive, but they didn't have the USB Port to port.

Speaker 1:          02:02:22       No, it has a little battery thing. Sticks to charge your phone. You don't. Don't fucking laptop. Maybe can't handle it. Maybe it can handle the power draw because it's so thin, like it only exists as something that you can store things in the cloud, which is where they're trying to snake. I try to bring you. Bless you. Do you still accept. Bless you even though you're not religious anymore or did I just defend your sensibility? Did I trigger you in any way? Hurt man. I don't. It's not a correct gender pronouns for today. I am a. He today ain't going by he. I go by he everyday. I'm going to try z out for awhile. Z, Z, Z, h e e Dot. What is that? Is that a new one? Gender neutral. Gender neutral was kind of like shit hit. You'll be whoever you want.

Speaker 1:          02:03:09       Z, H dot. I'm just already. Oh, why does it have to be directly? Why do you have to say, Mr? What do we formal ha my fucking checking into a hotel position of words are using. It's like no one has to say that. That's just what they've been saying. I think they, uh, you need to be able to control what people say. I love that people like shit on some sort of stand up and they go, oh, what is that all you can talk about it. It's like, that's not all they can talk about. That's one little sentence in this whole bit. That's part of the whole special. It's really not all they can talk about. Yeah. But if I'm going to make fun of it, that's what I'm going to say. I want to say that this is all you can talk about, bro.

Speaker 1:          02:03:40       You like drag me to hell too. Huh? Love me and read. I went to see a up and we were so happy and so Gora where like you fucked up. She just dragged me down. I finally saw it. I'm like this movie, whether it's a comedy. Perfect. You weren't high enough and you didn't go see with me. Come see you. Me and Duncan would see. Drag me to hell. We would love it. Love it. We would have the best time you ever see up. Yes. Cartoon. Yeah. I liked up up. Was good. That's good. It's interesting, but it was sad. It was that the first 10 minutes are beautiful. Yeah. It's interesting. You saw what won best comedy last night at the Golden Globes. Know the Martian. Oh yeah. How did that word Marshall and best comments at work? How does the Martian when best comedy and comedy or musical category, and I don't know how it gets, why they still only comedy or musical.

Speaker 1:          02:04:26       This so offensive to both comedy and music. That's not a comedy and it's not a musical. Listen, award shows or students call it other. They're stupid award. How did the Marsha when best comedy. They're stupid because he made so he kept it lighthearted sometimes. Trying to be plus one. The best one. One W we've already established right here between you and I. The Shit I love that you hate, but I genuinely love star wars. Like I walked out of there going, yes, they fucking did it. I walked out of there like they nailed it. They upgraded the original movie and made it fit in today and he did it with great acting and a great storyline. It was perfect. It was very star wars s fucking hated it. I didn't hate it, but it's just like, I thought it was like a b. okay, let's, let's pays.

Speaker 1:          02:05:11       Good. It was a fun movie. Tell me some other movies that you've seen recently. So Star Wars would compare a hateful eight. No way you saw seen that? Um, uh, I don't see that though. I enjoyed madmax. Yeah, me too. I thought it was really fun. Chase, you know, Eddie Bravo. None of those fucking hated it. Really hated it. There were none. There was none of the points where I'm like, this wouldn't exist in that world. I set up. I'm like, that wouldn't happen in star wars. The world they set up. It's like, why is she suddenly have Jennifer flowers with no training? Well, because there's a thing called editing, there's probably a bunch of scenes that were on the cutting room floor that explain her power soil or this point star wars. Everyone's seen it. You should really say, spoiler alert first. You really fucked up.

Speaker 1:          02:05:54       I'm sure we're already. We're already open. She just got it a little too fast and then it's like, well no. She was the chosen one. It's like, oh, like Luke Skywalker, she was wanting to study for a month with a fucking Yoda to get any of his powers. Well, chicks learn quicker and they have no chicken picker in their world and they have that. If you don't get it from as a kid, you're never going to get it. Well, there's the thing called morphic resonance and they think that like as people learn, things becomes easier for other people to learn things. We all learned together, but she beat up. It's beating up a storm trooper with it, which I've been studying with the head guy. She had a guy who's been studying under the main gracie and she was like, I just sort of get Jujitsu and I think I can beat this guy who's been studying under the main gracie.

Speaker 1:          02:06:35       Bj Penn won the world championship three years in. Weird Shit happens man, though. He wasn't just like, yeah, but you know what? You don't realize that she was using the forest, but she's probably using it all along. It wasn't flood mode, but you saw first week, right? What's first week? First Week. The first week or two was out. Oh yeah. That's why it was the same as the other movie when it came out. Episode one where everyone's like me to like, fuck yes, this is way better than those. But it was not as good as people were remembering. How dare you. Were you in a theater when they clapped? When they saw them letting him Falcon? Um, I clap almost brainwash week. I almost cried. I know. Oh, I hope they do the other things. They've already done the lead. Han Solo showed up. My heart filled with joy.

Speaker 1:          02:07:16       I liked that. That was fun. That was fun. I liked that a lot. That was great. With Chewie, we're home like, fuck. Yes. I liked that a lot. They fucked up in that regard, right? Spoiler alert. No, there's no spoiler alerts anymore. The chance. Don't say it. What if people like fast forward it and they get to the part where we say Han solo got killed. There was a guy that I saw a picture of somebody. You know those things you can put in the back of your truck, like a the Smith family. What Solo dies in the force awakens in the Star Wars. So rude. That's really driving a rental or it's big spoiler, spoiler. Fucking awesome movies with these boilers. You have a chance right then to get on it or you're done. I already knew I already knew going into see the movie, but we'd already been spoiler and forget.

Speaker 1:          02:08:04       It had already been spoiled for me, but I still enjoyed the phone. Who's going out there to die? I knew he was gonna die when he walked out on that platform is like, what do you do? Obviously you shoot him. Yeah. Okay. Why don't you shoot your stupid fucking son, late term abortion. Sun come up. Worst case scenario, you one of the coolest guys of all time, loved by millions, and your son has just turned out to be evil. Went to the dark side. Happens. Oh, by the way, you had a son with Princess Leia. So you get the fuck Princess Leia. You know what you think? A match made in heaven. He's super heroic. Swashbuckler with a giant big foot by side during the hot princess and they get together and fuck and they make an evil baby that winds up killing Danny. That's bullshit. That is bullshit.

Speaker 1:          02:08:45       How much did it make you laugh when? When that guy finally took off, his Adam driver finally took off a helmet and you're like, fuck, as a beautiful Semitic man. He looked like an awesome magician. Oh my God. There was giggling where it's like you as medic man. He's gorgeous. And that's. There's no way those. There was parents. He's a gorgeous jus. Wow. Alright. It's hot for that guy. What's his name? Kylo Ren. So his name that was choppy James made me back me up on that. That was ridiculous. And he pulls off his helmet was this evil guy. And let me back you up. I'm right here, Bro. I'm not leaving you alone. You didn't think that was done? Oh, it was ridiculous. Perfect hair. How does your hair stay perfect and that. Why isn't it sweaty? There'd be no. He's a full helmet. He's a beautiful head of hair.

Speaker 1:          02:09:30       As soon as you pull it off, it's like you just got to have a blow out because he got his hair all blown out like he's on the set. You know he pulls this sweaty fucking metal helmet off. Do you? I want you to be sweating in that stupid thing where you're up killing people. I mean, he's killing people. He's running around. He's grabbing them and crushing them. He's hacking things up with his fucking sword. Remember that beautiful, beautiful man. That's that Chris says Leah and fucking if that guy, what's his name? What's that guy's name? Who's the actor? Harrison Ford did not give birth to that. Listen, if that guy acts like a dick to girls and just bang, someone ever calls them back. It's not as fault. No, it's not his fault. Look at him. He's got powers, gets super powers. The force is strong with him. Like for real. Like the forced to bank checks. It's very strong. He might've abuse it. He could get away from him driving it before we do this take. Yeah, it's beautiful. It's a ridiculous movie, but I loved it. I do like the, the, the theories of like there'll be stormtroopers are like, wait, I'm not feeling this. I liked it. When they handle it, it's like, yeah, keep checks on them all the time. One, I don't know how this one got

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       through. Isn't it interesting that the first storm trooper we see without a helmet, black guy quit or you're saying the fuck the first storm trooper? No, the first, well the first quarter, but they didn't concentrate on the storm trooper helmet maybe, but nobody paid attention to them were the first one they pay attention to is a black guy. Interesting. Diversity. The version that is the case. I think star wars is a case where you could make the argument that even though they might have gone towards diversity, they nailed it. A woman's a perfect fucking stopping girl and the man who's a storm trooper was like the right race or the sun's going to be like gender. Both of them seemed totally fine, honestly, hoping that the fighter pilot and the storm trooper had a gay affair because it seemed like they were, they were really close, like the way they, the way they hugged, they had like a deep embrace.

Speaker 2:          02:11:29       Oh, how you been man? Deep embrace there was so happy to see each other. So happy. It was a lot like, um, when that movie, um, uh, what does the cowboy movie when they go gay, Black Mountain, brokeback mountain. It's almost like when those who hadn't seen each other for a while and they just start, do they make it out together and they just dove into each other's arms and went after it? Yeah, I mean they live through life and death out there with laser beams and shit. People shooting at them, they survived a crash, landed together. There's a bond with people, they say that when people form relationships after traumatic events, like, like if you met someone during nine slash 11 and like you grabbed her, come with me and you grabbed her hand and you, you ran and you guys both barely got out of the building and the building collapsed and you gotten a car and got away together and then she's crying and she stays in your apartment.

Speaker 2:          02:12:15       You want it falling in love. You are fucking relationship will be super intense because it's always going to be connected to this one, like really powerful event. Like Christie Brinkley apparently had a situation like that when she was in a helicopter crash with this dude and then wound up marrying the dude and then it fell apart. It doesn't make it look live with them. I just feel like we together baby, we're supposed to survive this together and the bond that you have because you sort of imprint on this moment like you ever go somewhere where like you had a really bad time and year round that area and even 10 years later you'll still feel shitty about it. I remember this, yes. Deep emotional connection with somebody that's like, I have emotional connections with clubs where I bombed. I go by like, like if I went by some places in Boston and be like, Ooh, I remember eating Dick up their restaurant now you're like, I can't, I can't eat here.

Speaker 2:          02:13:03       Yeah. That's nothing. Like people can develop some serious emotional connections to areas. Had that Tom Cruise movie that was actually good that nobody saw. Oh, was that good? Oh yeah. Where he kept going back in time. Oh wait a minute. Oh, that was really good. Really good. That was already given up on it from the last one. So. But that was good and they handled everything right. Like that was happened. This would happen. You're like, oh, there it is. It is. But he had that girl so they kept trying to fall in love with. I mean figure it out. Oh, if we get to this stage in yesterday, she's going to will follow them up and let's just stay here and stay in love as long as possible. That's beautiful. Yeah, that's what I'd like. I ain't never got to work out like that. Those aliens were cool.

Speaker 2:          02:13:43       They weren't really original. Who? Robot aliens. They were weird. Sorta mechanical, transforming alien things that just like they were. They were awesome because they were so creative. Like I'd never seen anything that I go, oh, that's like this. Yeah. They dropped them like cannon balls and the, the ground. They're just like these, like, like a squids, like maybe the coolest aliens in a movie ever. I mean these people are shooting at them and it's like, Oh, you guys are done. You have no chance. Yeah. They morphed and changed. Maybe pull the video up so you could see what that, uh, that scene was like because it's cool to see the, uh, that looks like an illustration to Frank Frazetta looking thing. Do you know Frank Frazetta is no heathen? No. Nothing. Who is the customer is amazing artist who used to do a Conan the barbarian. Really?

Speaker 2:          02:14:32       Yeah. Pull it before we go to this. Pull up Frank Frazetta conant. Just school this sad ban. Frank Frazetta Conan. Wait, wait. See this image motherfucker. This guy was the shit. And like the seventies. Oh Wow. Go with the one right next to it, to the left of that. That's the classic one. Go full screen on that. That's a classic classic. So that's a real barbarian do. That's Conan the barbarian. That's what got me into those with a girl, a naked woman at his feet. I was standing on top of Jesus. The blood and bones and meat bones. Got a hot girl. Doesn't give a fuck. She's a lying on the blood while he's got a sword in. Just want to hold onto your reasons. He's covered in scars too. It's got scars all over his face, all over his arms. That was what got me into Conan these images by Frank Frazetta because they created this superman, the Sumerian barbarian who loves having girls. That has. Of course he does. That's the only reason why to fight with a sword son. Whilst if y'all can't get pussy, they understood it back then. Let's go to this one right now. Sexist, go.

Speaker 2:          02:15:42       Bam. Sexism's alive. He came in her 34 times. That's got double sticks out. No, that's. Come all Jane. She's got her, her vagina is so full of cum. It's like pushing forward on an abdominal wall that can cause Hernias, shoot and lows in her and killing people. Like that was back before they even knew what six packs were. And he had a six pack. No one has six pack in the seventies. That guy, they have perfect bodies. They were bigger than any body builder. Pretty cool. Pretty cool paintings. Well, when Conan was played by Arnold Schwartzenegger, everybody, like, that's what everybody recognizes, you know? But yeah. Yeah. But the character in the present drawings was much more. Here's was a closer to comic strip before. Oh No, no, no. It was a book a of books by a guy named Robert e Dot Howard. And Robert Howard is this really fascinating guy.

Speaker 2:          02:16:34       They did a movie about him and the dude from one of those cop shows the guy from, um, you know what? The dude from full metal jacket, amazing actor from full metal jacket or play. The guy shot himself. The guy will get bullied and everything. He's amazing. What is this fucking name? Vincent. Sorry Vincent. He's amazing. He's, he's an amazing actor. He wasn't going to say he's in it. He's in a what? A, what the fuck are we just talk Conan? Yeah, going. No, he plays Robert Howard. That's what it is. He plays Robert e Dot Howard in a biography on property. Howard's life in a movie and I didn't see the movie, but Robert Howard was supposed to be this like really strange guy who lived with his mom and he shot himself I think when he was 36, so he had this like, is that it? The whole wide world.

Speaker 2:          02:17:22       He had some serious mental issues for sure, but he also, he wasn't healthy and so he had imagined this, this superman, this uber monch who was destroying people back in this fictitious world that he created that supposedly was a long time ago, but who knows, you know, it was like these, these countries that never existed and they were doing battle on this witchcraft and demons and monsters. And then there was this barbarian usurper, this king who became a king by killing everything in his path. He was like this indestructible man. That's Conan the barbarian. And so Robert e Dot Howard sort of created this guy who's the antithesis of what he was. He was as frail guy who lived with his mom. He's a pussy and just he, he wrote his longing about this guy, this lust for adventure thing. Everything killed, everything always survived. He was just this uber man, the greatest of all time is giant man.

Speaker 2:          02:18:23       And moved like a panther who like had a mind, like a steel trap. He would never show weakness. He'll, you know, he'll always was ready to die but never did. So he wrote all these really bad ass books. They were really wild as probably now if I read them and be like, what am I reading? But when I was 11 they were the shit really stuff. I'm sort of, I kind of like get. It wasn't like he put his hard cock in her gut and it wasn't like that kind of stuff. It was like from antic, you know, like it was more about like cleaving heads and, and the Gore of him being covered with Gore and bits of sinew cover the glistening blade as a slices through the attackers will, you know, and then they realize like how they fucked up and try to do battle with Conan and everybody died, everybody dies.

Speaker 2:          02:19:14       But Conan, but it was just this for a 12 year old kid or whatever the fuck I was when I guess I was probably like that age when I got into it, it was amazing. It was like, whew, you know, because you're a boy. Like first of all, no one's gonna let you see that you're like a 12 year old boy. They don't show it in movies. They cut it. Yeah. You don't really even like today they do. Like today if you watched, um, a recent barbarian movie, like there was, they would show. You see Jason Mamoa. Have you seen him play Konan? He's the guy from game of thrones. Oh, the real tall one. Yeah, the, well, the really handsome guy that dies early. This dude, that dude is a cool motherfucker. I ran into him recently at whole foods. He couldn't be cooler. I've ran into with the UFC before too.

Speaker 2:          02:19:58       He's just a really nice, really friendly guy who uh, you want to hate him because he's a little too beautiful. Little too beautiful, a little too tall. But he was my favorite all time Conan because he, that's what Kona is supposed to be built. Like maybe we'll do it on TV show now. He did a movie. It was really, it was kind of a shit movie unfortunately. But um, it's cool to watch anyway. I enjoyed it. But Tim is going in. Yeah, he's a good size for Kona and like that would be like with Conan would be built well you'd have a chance to win like everyone of your hand to hand combat battles. Yeah. He wouldn't be built like Arnold Schwarzenegger if you look at the data drawing. So like go to the, the [inaudible] with the sword again, the St, the classic one. It's a little bit over there right there apparently.

Speaker 2:          02:20:37       So like the real Kona is like a little more built in him, but that's probably because a homeboys on the couch. No, Jason, my mom was like, that's actually what he's really built, like sports and Agora was filled with 32 pounds, the Mexicans supplements and then give them time. You know, when he played killing enemy, nobody's built like that when he was Conan. I mean he had the most ridiculous fucking body. Schwartzenegger was number one in the world body. Well he's slimmed down though. He slimmed down towards the other ones like you see Kinda tell a difference between that one and the other one that you just had those monster huge. It's so big. And by the way that's small, like right there, like that's very slim in comparison. Like that's a guy who is slimming down. Like that guy is built like tyron what?

Speaker 2:          02:21:25       The body of the drawings. Yeah, that's perfect. Actually. That must have been one of the later movies. So I think like he went from being the bigger bodybuilder. It looks so weird to see him with that fucking chest and the sword and a backwards baseball cap on backwards baseball hat. Right. Was like a little it go back up. Does he really have one yet? Backers that almost looks like, but it's a Bandana. It could be a bag. You can be like a hillbilly with a sword who's really yolked really old hillbilly. Slimmed down. He was still massive, you know, even when he got smaller. But if you go back to is bodybuilding days when he was Mr Olympia. Holy Shit. He in my opinion, out of all like the bodybuilders styles, like there's a bunch of different styles. Like now guys are just massive and shredded. Yeah. Well that guy is the guy on the left is the foxes multiple time. Mr Olympia, what the Hell's his name? Because it has legs. It'll gross. What is

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       his name? God dammit. Jamie, what does it say? Ronnie Coleman. So that's not real. Ronnie Coleman was many years later. Right? So that's just a comparison to the two of them. Oh, I see. Okay. See if you it back up again. Go back to that image again, please. That's really amazing there. Yeah, but if you go back to that image, the one. Yeah, look at the difference in the legs. That's the real difference. Ronnie Coleman's legs are massive. They're insane. They don't seem real. See Arnold seem ridiculously muscular as well, but real. How does he wear shirts, Goldman, either their waists or narrow. Why would you were closer? You're built like that. Just walk around this little grape smugglers all day just to let everybody know what the fuck is up. He can't stay like that for very long either. That's the other thing you have to realize when you're looking at these athletes.

Speaker 1:          02:23:17       Should I call them athletes? Bodybuilders? Yeah. I think they're a little bit different than an athlete. I mean, it's obviously what their muscles get tired and they can't. Well, yeah, they're, they're in the state of massive dehydration there. Uh, they can't maintain that very long. It's super dangerous when guys get, um, that, that dehydrated like that they can't hang on for very long. They don't have much endurance. You know, you're feeling really tired all the time, but that's how you get your skin really thin. Like a lot of those guys, when they do that, they're fucking exhausted while they're doing it, but they maintain a good face and flex just crazy what people do to their bodies. Like even then like you look at that, which is big giant, but they're the guys who are so much bigger today. Like you see them there or something. Trump. Who's the guy to the left? Is that Franco Columbo? Because guys about to lose.

Speaker 1:          02:24:11       Some days we thought it had a future. Well, there's a lot of those guys that did have a future. They just never had a future like him, but he's just said crazy ambitious motherfucker. You know her, her burns bit about him. No bird has a bit of a. Oh yeah, a great man. That's right. That's what after you bang is made. Yeah. No, you can do all these things. They tell them, you can't come to America, be a bodybuilder. You're just some German. You came, you're going to win. You won the biggest bodybuilder. Well, you can't what? You want to be a movie star? No, you can't be a movie star. It's come on. You should work bodybuilding. You can't say you did it. Alright, that's enough. You've done enough with. You're the biggest movie star in the world. All right, well that's it. Now stop.

Speaker 1:          02:24:48       You can't run California. That's not allowed. You're a movie star bodybuilder and all you're doing. You're doing it. I bet. Now you want to fuck it made of course. Oh, to the line. That's what brought them down. Yeah, a great man. A great man. I think if they didn't have law against it, a law against it because he was born in another country president. He wasn't president. I think he could be president now. No bullshit. He's too far removed from his face and find a new woman, new woman that really anchors them other than the woman who is religious. I mean she's not like crazy about it, but there's something about Jesus's teachings, so it's really starting to appeal to arnold as he gets older in life, and then boom, connects with that. Report that data to get Jesus in real rural. Pop it over to Jesus forgives.

Speaker 1:          02:25:33       You could get Jesus to just listen. Jesus said some cool shit. Okay. He just did. He really did. He did some cool. If it was a real guy, which is debatable, right? It's a lot of. Not a lot of evidence that there was a real guy. I wrote about him and Tom Joad. Did they know what else they write about dragons? Anything about witches and demons? No. No. It's not the one that tells you if you jerking off. No. Oh, the other one? Yeah. Okay. I don't know. What do you think? I think it was real. I think they did have historical evidence for them, but not the powers. Now they're walking, I'm walking. You ever seen that movie? There's a lot of shit. It's like, okay. Before the internet, you remember those videos of that Sensei who's like trying to rush me and just with one finger who draws people back and they'll fly, but it's clearly faked.

Speaker 1:          02:26:20       Before, there were videos of that, they were just, dude, I heard this guy can knock off any attacker with one finger and I don't have tv either. So I don't know what's real. That's what Jesus does. Jesus got big. Well, here's the thing, people are telling stories about them. The idea, Jesus coming back from the dead, right? That was the big one, right? That was probably one of the biggest ones he did. Um, and then what it is later and then what happens? He goes away. What happened? So yeah, I think he just cut. They're like, oh look, his body's not in here. He must've come back from the dead. He couldn't be that hyenas eight his body or anything right now. Or somebody just would grave rob, why don't you leave a body out and no, no, no, no, he's, he's back up again.

Speaker 1:          02:27:00       And then he went to heaven. So he came back to life once a heaven. Jamie, do you know, put him in a tomb. They put them into them right in front. And three days later the rockers moved and people's, someone saw him go up into heaven, full body. Oh, this lion bitch. So Dome of the Rock is worse, still went up to heaven. You know who saw him? Those lesbians in that club, Vancouver, they were their, their, their account is totally tribunals. Have too much power. Yeah. If you had a Canadian tribunals to discover whether or not Jesus ever came back to life, I just think if you came back to life should probably stick around. Talk to people. Let them know that you did it. Look, I'm so for real. You guys crucified me? Not Again, bitch. Come at me this time. I'm going to use my magic.

Speaker 1:          02:27:40       I'm here to fix you guys. Come on, die for your sentence. Get it together. Bitches. Nope. Removing anything we know is not true from that. How do you know it's not true? Well, no shit. From what you know, let's say a atheist or agnostic. That's the guy who got strung up for saying he was a messiah, which he wasn't the only one at a time thing is messiah. He got strung up for it and he died and the followers had to keep hope alive and whatever they did, they did, but like if it was a real person, then it's like, yeah, he got, he got killed. Like a lot of people. Well, it's so hard. It's so hard to recount the truth in an accurate way from things you've actually experienced. Yeah. Now I'm managing the god out of it. Those still. But imagine

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       those stories of whoever he was counted down and in and re retold by people that barely remember the word innovation. They weren't even the region. They added their own bullshit to it. Like people do the added their own spice. They have their own rules, their out of their own happy ending or sad ending or consequences of said action, you know, and Jesus said, if you do not cover from your eyes to your, to your ankles, you shall be stoned to death and the dishonor telling like you people just add shit. Right? Who knows what the original message was and who the fuck it was that came up with it. It might've been to some really cool dude wanted everybody to get along and so they decided to kill this fucker because he's talking shit. Imagine if the Romans came to town. They got their swords and ready to kick some ass and this fucking hippie is over here talking some stupid shit.

Speaker 2:          02:29:10       No, dude, we're here to kill people. Okay. We're just going to nail you to this cross like we do. Thousands of other fucking people. As a matter of fact, they had. What was the story that there's a story in history on fire that Danieli Bull Lee talks about where the Romans, they put miles and miles of crucified bodies on this road. I can get my thrones. Dude. It's horrific. When he recounts it, it's horrific and they did that. So why would they give a shit about doing this to one other dude will let them do whatever they want. Because. So if you were in the town, and this is one cool guy wants everybody to get along and you're like, man, I'm glad Jesus is here. He's talking sense. You know, we really should listen to him. I'm like, why are we being assholes? We really do. We appreciate our, our, our surroundings and, and love each other like brothers and sisters.

Speaker 2:          02:29:57       Oh Shit, dude. The Romans look over the hill. Fuck, and you look over the hill and you see dust and horses. Thousands of them coming forth. This dude's gonna step up and try to talk, laid down and chop his fucking dick off and stuff it up his nose. They're monsters. That's why I love game of thrones. They don't fuck around. They're not like. They were just like, this is how it would be a bunch of loose cannons. Oh yeah. No, no. Government oversight. Die Cellphone reason why take the chance of sorts to die by the sword heads and fucking arms get lopped off. Well, I've always hated the crossbow. Takes too long to reload to bullshit weapon. It really is. Crossbows, we're putting the kid a fucking bow, folks. A real bone out. Does that make you mad? Walking dead and it makes me mad.

Speaker 2:          02:30:48       No, it makes me mad. The walking dead. I. He's one of the coolest college. How does that fucking Arrow not get a pass through? Okay. He's shooting people in the bodies. He should always. It always sticks out and he pulls it right out. Listen man, I ruined three or four hours a week, a week. This guy has been out there. It's finding new arrows. I shoot a lot of arrows and sometimes when I'm practicing with the New Georgia new releases, I'm practicing a new archer releases. Sometimes I hit rocks and shit and they just break break. I'm exaggerating the amount per hit a rock on purpose. It just destroys the arrows. The arrows going too fast just shatters and explodes. But my point being like, this guy has the same goddamn arrows. Like, where's he? These arrows are gone, dude. You shot a hundred zombies anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:31:33       Arrows. You just don't. You're not going to pull them out. They're going to be perfect. First of all, you have field points and that's bullshit. Anyway. You don't even have broad heads. Again, I make to put a little pinhole in. It just shoots him in the head, you know, and it just sticks right in there magically and he pulls it right out. Like what are their heads made of? Yeah, I know the long and where did they. When they eat, what? What happens to the food? They don't. Their bodies don't still work in process. Stuff is way better off with a regular bone arrow because irregular bone. Our look, you can make your own bone now. That'd be better than that stupid fucking crossbow. You. You want something? You can just load up like that and keep shooting. You can shoot several times. That stupid thing.

Speaker 2:          02:32:11       You've got to grab it. You've got to pull it. People just like it because it looks like Chewbacca his gun in Star Wars. It's some old school shit like you think, oh, that's even better than no bone marrow. Bone ours way better than a crossbow. Unless you're a pussy. You don't want to learn how to shoot a bow and arrow. They should buy walking dead with her actual bow and Arrow had those guys butt heads. I mean, it's not a bad weapon. If you want to kill something, like if you want to use it, like if you, if you're in a deer blind and you're trying to kill a deer and you want to show someone how to do it with a crossbow, it's a great weapon for that because it's really easy to do everything. Sebastian's pit about bow and arrow. No, he's got a good bit.

Speaker 2:          02:32:45       Don't tell me. Don't say don't say don't say I don't want it to go. Okay. I'll trailer. A lot of his act outs are so good. He's such a good dude too. It's cool seeing a guy like him. You've got to look it up. I don't want to play it. It is, yeah. I'll find it later. But for, for folks listening co go, go check it out. But I mean like most people don't actually have a bow and Arrow, so if anyone would like this bit is these fucking funny man. And he's a really nice guy too. That's cool. He's one of those guys where everybody likes him. I've never heard anybody doesn't like Sebastian. You know? One person doesn't like Sebastian. Yeah. Ever. No. No. That's why it's cool to just, yeah, this is just a. But he's also a guy that like really worked hard. That guy, he hustled, man. He made it happen for himself. He kept getting better, but that was his catchphrase. Couldn't do that without doing that. He came in and did a podcast and he was fucking hilarious. He's hilarious. He was really so like particular. Yeah. Yeah. Very particular. Like what's going on with your fingernails? It looks and it just bothers them. Or like what? What, what, what is this? What is this? Paint your fingernails.

Speaker 2:          02:34:05       Yeah. He's another guy that has like a very specific style. His clean. Think about it, man. I don't know. Think about it. No, I got it. I'm going to say no. I've seen them before. Maybe just one of those crowd work, but it's crowded because everything's. He lifts everybody up instead of shirts. Gross. He goes, that's shirts. Amazing. Couldn't never get away with that shirt. Look at how gorgeous this guy. There's. Smile. You got all your teeth fixed, Huh? Beautiful. He takes the opposite end of it and just get get the money out of just being positive. That's interesting. That's in that sense. Maybe. Yeah. Maybe that sense. Which is the act. Exactly the exact opposite of what I used to love about watching dies in the or just hurting people. There'd be a guy. He goes, look at you, look at you. The last piece of pussy you saw is the last piece of pussy over Africa.

Speaker 2:          02:34:56       Trust me, trust me. It's over. He would have a cigarette. It's sophie. Who's going to fuck you gonna. Fuck though. Victory Shits on you, but leave. Who's going to fuck you? You're going to pay for it. You're going to be sad. You're going to fall in love with the hookah. Bring him into your life in Sydney. Meanwhile, all the time she's getting God looking. He would just go deep, but it was fun. Like it was theater. It was theater. It didn't seem real, right? No, no, no, no, no. It's it's theater like it's a character that's doing this mean act. When you act like yourself on stage, people feel way more like how dare you, but when it's complete character or a movie where it's like dissolve, definitely not true. So it's okay. Just seems more like reality. I think that's why people get mad or more of stand up.

Speaker 2:          02:35:45       Look to the head. Is that good? Yeah. She bowie dying. Fuck. What'd you think of him? I loved him. Yeah. I saw the exhibit and Melbourne is Bowie Exhibit. He had multiple songs. Yeah. I just. The way he dealt with like live performance and like getting costumers, like hitting the world's best customers. Like I got to talk to you. And then he were just like, here's what I'm kind of doing now. I want you to design something with me. I forgive him for dancing in the street to the street with him and Mick Jagger. Forgive them. I forgive them for arguably the most confusing sexually. It leads to a young man. I'm like, what is happening with him and Mick Jagger? I was like, what is this message? You're confusing the fuck out of me. I don't know what you guys are doing. I want to know, are you guys put tonic friends just start dancing for some strange reason or it seems like you're flirting with each other like I need to know.

Speaker 2:          02:36:43       I need to know because all the time. Well, Mick Jagger's ex wife got mean said she found a David Bowie and bed with mcjagger, so she told everybody that's where when you're a guy like David Bowie or mick jagger becomes really problematic being married to some normal person because she's got this amazing story. So what if they want to get together and figure out whether or not there was like, oh yeah, I fuck all sorts of stuff like this a shot. Let's see what the fuck happens. And meanwhile this woman that Mick Jagger supposedly had some sort of a contract with where they're not supposed to have sex with other people. She got all upset and she fucking puts them on blast all over the world. Probably put it in a book or something. How rude to each other. Listen, that's privileged information, ma'am. That's not like regular people.

Speaker 2:          02:37:29       That's not like Bob, you know the guy who fixes bikes, the bike shop and Tim who's the ups driver, has friendly conversations with Bob and the gun to them fucking in the men's room. It's not. This is a bigger deal. This is. This is gonna affect the record companies is gonna affect venues can affect the people that sell tickets. There's a lot of jobs attached to these two people and you're just being rude because you're a petty con. What do you care? What do you care? Look at the way he's dressed. Of course he fucks guys. Jesus Christ. That was a shocker to you. Doesn't make them any less. Awesome. It makes them more awesome. Look it up. These guys from behind you there. You imagine if you and I did a music video and we were doing this, what are you doing? You can do this.

Speaker 2:          02:38:11       These thickness fingers couldn't kiss each other for more than two seconds for a hilarious thing on a pay per view event. How much? My biggest regret is that it's pulling away and laughing when I shouldn't have. I didn't realize I thought the cameras did. You give him a ton and I give him a little. Did you. What? Did he give it back? You think? I don't like Dunkin, but did he give it back? We did. You guys tongue? We were. We were locked in there, man. I thought you guys were like just just lips. I didn't know you went in tongues. You gotta sell it. Oh, you sold was trench coat. Is he warm or cold or what is he? What is he? Because it seems like they're both in different climates. Yeah, like David Bowie, he seems like he's in a rainy London sorta climate, but Mick Jagger's in the keys. The Florida keys. He's having a good old time. He's like, listen to Jimmy Buffet music or some shit with c eight at night. Blue Pants. What's going on with you? What's that about why they freeze frame on that, but does that you. Did you do that Jamie, or is that the actual video? That's how it ends. That's unfortunate or fortunate depending on what you're really into. Doing ground control to major Tom. Come on, man. That's like startups character and he

Speaker 1:          02:39:15       all coked up. They had these coke spoons as part of the exhibit, his, all of his cooks, but they didn't hide anything. Did they really? Yeah. So in his coke rage or whatever he was in, he goes, uh, there's this famous thing. He goes not only as a, you guys have been wonderful audience and not only is this the last, uh, ziggy stardust show of the tour, but it is also in the band, has no idea what he's talking about, what he's going to say, because this is also the last day he started us show of all time. He plays, his last song gets off and the bands like, wait, we're done with. That's how you're telling us we're fucking done. Holy Shit. That sucks for the band. Yeah. And then he went and started just being David Bowie wow. Here this character. That was huge. And they're like, what are you doing?

Speaker 1:          02:39:54       Don't stop. He goes, fuck this. I'm an artist. I'm developing stuck with that moneymaker forever. Wow. Well, he was, he was just, he had some fucking really amazing songs but amazing songs. And they were so original. Yeah. But his live performance, they showed them on the top of the pops, just like androgynous shit on like a late night talk show. Not late for. She'll lecture like a mainstream thing and they just like almost half kissing this guy and people are like, wait, what the fuck was that? What did I just see? Yeah. And the music was so unique. [inaudible], you know, his style was, it was just, it was very specific. You know, was very David Bowie. Yeah. Oh my God. What a great song. That is. What a great song. Yeah, he was awesome, man. It wasn't like, okay, when Michael Jackson died, everyone's a Michael Jackson Fan. Everybody right when he died it was sad, whatever. But he wasn't still making music and stuff, you know? So it was like, oh, it's too bad he passed. But it was either that or 30 years later we weren't going to miss out on anything. David Bowie released an album last Tuesday. They did. Really? Yeah. It's just getting the first hit is just on the radio right now. He still has stuff that's being planned for radio releases in the next. You know, humor like there was a rollout scheduled fucking cancer man.

Speaker 2:          02:41:10       He did a lot of stuff, allegedly. I don't even think he hid from it. Yeah. It's a bummer man. Bummer. Did you see the Sean Penn thing on Sean Lynch, Chapo. Sean Penn. I've completely changed my opinion about him. I think he was a blowhard. Linda did that chris rock thing. I was very critical of him because the chris rock made a joke and he's doing his monologue and he made a joke about jude law and sean penn comes out and goes, well, the reason margaret, like, come on man, you know, so I goofed on them. But that fucking guy went to Mexico to the jungle to meet el chapo and interview him and write about it for rolling stone. Wow. Just to be a journalist, dude. He has everything to lose. He's got a family, he's got children, he's got money, he's got fame, he's got everything.

Speaker 2:          02:42:04       He has no reason to want to do this. And he decides to do it. He decides to and people who are criticizing him and it's really bizarre way that first of all they said was one of these guys said, I read this tweet about it where you're saying, I wonder how sean penn feels about real journalists being killed, you know, because of the narco is have killed journalists that report on them. Well guess what? He's risking his life like you don't think they would think it would be funny to kill sean penn. Like if, if, if somehow another sean penn had irritated el chapo. El chapo decided to have him killed. It must've known the risk of that. This guy doesn't care. El chapo got out and tunnels. I heard he was hiding out and justin martindale's asshole. I don't think justin martindale's assholes that little. That's how. No, I'm saying that's the series of tunnels and if you looked in there, you know, I mean that big a.

Speaker 1:          02:42:52       So we interviewed el chapo. That's cool. He went to Afghanistan during the beginning of the war to right, or a wreck. One of those two street.

Speaker 2:          02:43:00       I don't. I'm not sure about that. I didn't. I wasn't aware of that, but what he did with el chapo was he got in touch with some mexican actress who knows el chapo, she's probably ghetto chapels, trembling sign and um, el chapo, uh, arranged a meeting and uh, they had like specific conditions like what? He had to read the story before it's published, which they've never granted before with rolling stone. They don't do that and they agreed to it because it's just like such a critical to illegally. I'm not gonna let you me that it's sean penn is interviewing, but all these journalists are mad. And Like what sean penn responsible for the fact that el chapo was killed. Other people like he shouldn't be sitting down and talk. You don't want a c, a conversation and it's kilograms. he is being a journal, a killer.

Speaker 2:          02:43:44       But okay, let's interview him. But manson, what does this kid shit like real journalists like don't say that. Like that guy. That's a Crazy risk. he took undeniably crazy risk. Just cattiness for anybody to shit on it. Like to say that he shouldn't have done that. Like he's not going to keep people alive by not going there. He's, and in fact, they believe that the paper trail or the electronic trail of them setting this up is probably what led to them capturing el chapo in the first place. So really, which they just did the whole thing it. And then he just, they only caught them like two days ago and they caught them like, right as this story is coming out with almost of americans still fucking rolling stone setup el chapo to make their stores selling from better. JamIe. So are you thinking, oh, I can't believe you're saying that.

Speaker 2:          02:44:31       I don't know why you would say that because I don't think the world works that way. God, jamie's like conspiracy. They sell the extra stuff. We just come down. They want to, they, the United States is going to give Mexico like a bunch of why? Because he gasoline or struggles that come here. Uh, because yeah, he sold drugs in America. So we get to pull them out of his country of have jurisdiction because they can't keep that fucker locked up. We can keep them locked up. They're like, enough to help us with is withholding this joker. He fucking escaped twice. We're done with this. Let's stop. I just, uh, I've completely changed my opinion on sean penn. What are you on p? Yeah, I knew it. The interview was in october. It wasn't october. It was just coming out now. Right. Which might be added to your.

Speaker 2:          02:45:15       It might be added to. Why? Why would release it now? Conspiracy member. It's illuminati controls all of the media. Do you think you'd get in trouble for, for doing this at all? Sean penn? Yeah. Fuck yeah, foR sure. Yeah. Look, man, he, he just got a story with one of the biggest drug dealers or the apparently the biggest drug dealer. If he's to be believed ever it's ever lived other than the other that's ever lived, allegedly. come on, man. I mean, of course you can get in trouble for that. That's a dangerous move. Like anybody that says that what sean penn did didn't take any courage. It's crazy in anybody who's like, why criticize it? Just look at it. What it is, what he got. He had a conversation with a a known gangster of incredible reputation. I mean, that's what that guy is. He's an unknown gangster of incredible reputation and sean penn met him in the jungle in Mexico. You don't think that's a ballsy move. That's one of the ballsiest moves that a person can do as a journalist, but with sean penn did, but to do it as a movie star, a fucking guy who's won oscars or at least an oscar, right? He's warning us ranks. Look, he's a bad motherfucker. I rescind my previous criticism, very big of you.

Speaker 7:          02:46:36       I heard that it was obviously a conspiracy thing, but I heard that the mexican government might have led el chapo out to get the cartels and gangs under control because once they arrested him vacuum, there was a vacuum. Now that he was out, he got everything wrapped up. Now that pulled back in, which is why he's been arrested again. Jamie's with conspiracies over here that's on the radio today. How dare you to repeat these problems?

Speaker 2:          02:47:01       Oh, who the fuck knows? I don't think they let him out. I think. I think somebody paid a shitload of money to have so many dig a tunnel and I don't think they do a good job of watching their prison. That's most like or probably there's probably some people in on it. Probably got paid to. Definitely write that. That's why they're so that's why they want to keep them here in the good old us way. We've got them locked down when we're done with this shit. I'm going to take them down to quantico, put them down in place. We got there. And the bottom of the denver airport, that's where he is comparing that. Denver airport prison flights, they always talk about. I want to see that place. Um, yeah. So I'm pretty sure it's bullshit. It was a jail down there. I think. A lot of jail.

Speaker 2:          02:47:42       Wow. Yeah, it doesn't. Fenway park have a jail too. I might've made that up. I don't know. I can see that. Um, but yeah. So I'll chop. I'll captured. And sean penn brody. Cool. Then he went down there and fucking it'S not the best story. Writing musical to work will dry and Points. But uh, but you still say it's wrong for him to go, like he's one of our finer sectors. What he did was just unnecessary and he was just trying to stand up for a guy that he has for his craft who doesn't get comedy. Right. But it's his craft that's he doesn't have to be who he is to be able to do harvey milk and to also be able to do the fast times at ridgemont high and the irish mob guy, like he's, he obviously knows how to get into his work.

Speaker 2:          02:48:24       He doesn't do a shit job. Like he's not doing an american sniper. Right. If you ever seen a movie where he plays it, where it seems like he's just phoning it in like, like moments you saw american sniper, you're like, this is not real, you know, you don't see sean penn and those movies in that. Like when here's like the scene where you're criticizing the bradley cooper scene where the girlfriend was banging another guy and it just seeMs all fake. Could you imagine sean penn and that saying, no, of course you can. It would be. It would, he would figure out how to make it more to shut up, brother. He would, he would figure out how to make it more real or he wouldn't be doing it. Like his quality of work is definitely to be respected. Like there's a few guys like that that have that Daniel Day lewis, you know him, a russell crowe. There's like, there's a few that have this

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       ability to like, transform into like mariel hemingway, a russell crowe puts out some stuff, although he's dunaway may. Faye dunaway. Like from the beginning, man, you ever watch the original stoner? That's the original rendition of a stoney. Everyone else is doing an impression of that map wasted already. Beats a sneaker or gets his head. That was my head was. How did you, uh, did you ever see chinatown? Faye dunaway? I don't know. Good lord. Jack nicholson to faye dunaway in chinatown. Oh shit. Yeah. There's, there's some fuckIng people you know who's that broad? That's a in all the coen brothers movies. She's really awesome. She was in fargo. She's amazing. Oh yeah. Yeah. He was already out with the acts. God damn it. She was in the movie fargo. She's Been in everything. Yeah. She's been in the movie fargo. Frances mcdormand. Yes. She's. She's one of those people that become you.

Speaker 1:          02:50:02       It's. I don't. Yeah. I don't care that she. I know who it is. Like she's so good. Like you lose yourself. Yeah. If I go to see a movie and I'm like, oh, that's that guy. How'd that guy get to play that guy? It doesn't make any sense. Like, how is. Wait a minute. You know seth rogan is steve wasniak. Nobody's not. Seth rogen like, what's going on here now? He's playing somebody. It's not that seth rogan's not good, but you know what I mean? Like I know who he is, but she's so goddamn good. You don't care who she is. You don't care that it's frances mcdormand. When she's playing a role, you bought hook, line and sinker. You're locked up in it, which is way harder to do. You know? It's way harder to do when you don't know who the person is. Like an ax maki.

Speaker 1:          02:50:42       Now I didn't know who any of these fucking people were, so it was perfect. It just slipped right in, but if one of those people have been tom cruise or the other one was nicole kidman had been like, come on like this. I know who you are, fucker. It's hard to see whenever your friend's book anything and you're watching a movie and you see like the or, or anybody you know or you know, Missouri. Bronto, like, um, ah. Yeah. It's just real hard to get lost in it. Yeah. Almost imponderable know them bowl plus it's not fun to get lost in it and it's fun to go. What's up?

Speaker 1:          02:51:12       That's what's fun, right? Yeah. Cut. Damn. At ari shaffir are you enjoying your new found success yet? Man, it's been great. I get a little worried about certain things. I keep track of who traveled all over the world though. Having all the world's real fun as shit I'm trying to do. I realized I made this problems with morrissey. Paul morrissey a few years ago, we were in a Denmark for some comedy festival. Nope. Excuse me. We're in montreux Switzerland for some comedy festival and then went to amsterdam afterwards and uh, just for fun. And we were like, let's go to new countries every year. Wow. just to visit or to work, whatever. Either one. Yeah. I mean I've really. One of the things I'd like to do in another country to see what it's like to do comedy there. You should do a show in Thailand. Thailand. How many shows? Just onE in bangkok. How was it? Fun as shit. Wow. That was a lot more thai people where they there. Then in China, China was all ex pats. Maybe one chinese person. Wow. Hong kong has been

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       mixed, but like Thailand, they speak some english dudes. So I might do a show in India this year. They speak english in India. That's how when you get your computer fixed. English. India in India, everybody speaks english so they don't have to do it for not just experts, but either way, if you have an american express issue, you're talking to someone in India pretty crazy. Found that out and then we named wonderful. They're renamed them. My name is fred. I am here today, but he's a problem with your phone card, man. I'm manic unexpressed. that has again, a racist. Just like he was saying this to most sword, this is more racist. You're appropriating an accent. No, it's racist for they renamed those people. That's racist. Yeah. Clearly I don't think american doesn't someone have a bid on that? Someone has a bit. I had a bit, I used to have a bit about it was it, you know, you know, eddie bravo had a real problem with those people one point in time.

Speaker 2:          02:52:57       And you know, eddie bravo is a real trickster. He's hilarious. Like eddie must have ordered like a um, a prescription medication and used his cell phone as the phone number. You know, like when you, you get a prescription, like what number do you leave? He left his cell phone. So somehoW or another that got, this was like in the early two thousands and somehow or another that got sold as a list, you know, how that happens out. Like oh, this guy buys prescription drugs or this guy. Uh, but as solar panels, and it sounds like for whatever reason you get a list that was like a big issue with people. They would sell your information. So he started getting all these phone calls from pharmacies and they lose people that barely spoke english and they're trying to sell him prescription drugs because this was during the day where there was a kind of a wild west period where you'd buy all your drugs from Canada and overseas and they would ship them and so you could get things without a prescription, like really heavy stuff without a prescription.

Speaker 2:          02:53:54       And so eddie would keep these people on the phone for ever. I mean forever. He would have these conversations with them and pretend that like some noises going on in the background and he would talk to him and say, what do you have that I can use? Oh hold on, I'll be right back. I have to clean my feet. And then he would go and like put the phone down for like five minutes and go take a leak. He would get something to drink and then come back to it and then start talking to them about what different drugs like I text, what do you have that gets your card? Do you have anything that gets your dick hard and like have these crazy conversations with these people and they would go on forever. Man. He would be laughing. It would hold the phone up to his chest and he loves playing tricks like that on people especially like he felt he had the green light because they're contacting him so he would drag on forever. Hang up though, let's be curse. Exactly. So he was dragging it on forever and he would go to like give them an address to send it to her credit card number. But then he would have some ridiculous excuse. He had to put the phone down, he put the phone down for like 10 minutes and then go back to it and pick it up, keep doing it. And it was Just one second. I need to deal with this idea of like crazy fake arguments, you know, like in the background, hold the phone down

Speaker 1:          02:55:04       and fucking scream and yell. And then you say he was about to get raped and he called the police and video record them. No, it was just for fun. Just kept doing it for the of. He would do it for like I'm telling you, man, he did a bunch of sort of remember those. You remember those? Yeah. Dude. He would get excited when the phone would ring. Hello. so what is the structure? So glad you guys called me. Yeah. It just don't have that kind of patience. I don't have that mind either. Got be bored. You shouldn't be bored. You got to be crazy. Huh? In a different way. He loves doing that though. He just. He gets such a kick out of doing that or he did. I'm sure now he's too busy. It's hilarious.

Speaker 1:          02:55:44       Yeah. They don't do that anymore. And do that call you. It's supposed to not have your cell phone. I'll be like, what am I supposed to call my cell phone ever? That was like a law change. Imagine if they didn't know the lord. I think it only came for when people didn't have unlimited phone calls. Wasn't like standard. Like, Hey, you're using other people's fucking time and money. That's actually a good argument to keep it the way it is. Yeah, because now they can be like, what, what's the difference? Because if it's free, if you get all the minutes in the world all the time, then people were free to contact you for no reason. Even fax machines, as soon as we had fax machines within, it was spam. Spam, just sending you some fucking ad. You remember when you call someone on the facts, but she went answer. Uh huh. He blogged you mother fucker.

Speaker 1:          02:56:31       Ridiculous. Yeah. Alright. Sphere, we're out of time. We've got to wrap this pitch up. Conflicts some dates or something.
