Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, it's a matter of time, right? Hopefully. Yeah. Well my dad is hilarious. My Dad is 86 and three quarters and he sent me an email today and it said, here's a link to an article about a marijuana reform, and he said, oh, it's going to be legal in my lifetime. I was like, Dad. I said, I hope you're right. You know, even if you have to live another 20 years. So I would have never thought in 2013. It was still be illegal. When I was a kid I, I thought it was a matter of time. Well I was on the board of normal for awhile, quite awhile and I was with people who started normal in 1970 and 71 and thought it would be legal in a few years. So that sort of tempers my, a sense of time to be with people who, you know, over 40 years ago thought it was only going to be a few years away that marijuana will be legal. Unfortunately they're still working to try to help bring that about. Do you lose enthusiasm sometimes when you see that it's still illegal after all this, now it's the, um, it's about, it's a worthy, like on a worthy opponent. It's a worthy goal and so I think we just do what we want to do. There's times when I felt like I was so blocked that I needed to do something where I could actually see change and so I stopped work for a week and painted my house.

Speaker 1:          01:18          Great. That's really must, must, must get to feel like you're spinning your wheels sometimes. Well, for years, and we just spent four years with Health Canada trying to get an import export permit to bring in eight grams of Mgma and this is after Health Canada had approved the protocol and our irb had approved the protocol and the four years it took and they went through all these ridiculous things about the pharmacy had to have bulletproof glass. It had to have all these alarm systems. Class people are gonna come in and steal your eight grams of acid. That was eight grams. Yeah. That would be in a safe and the safe had to be disguised in a wooden cabinet and the had to be bolted to the floor. They were harder than the U. S it was ridiculous, but. But we eventually prevailed. We just took every ridiculous thing and we did it. I mean, my policy is surrender when there's certain kinds of irrational things coming from people who are more powerful, try to give it to them. Well, that's probably why you're in the position that you're in your facilitator of this. I'm willing to dialogue venture forth. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:29          Wow. And then there's the legislation that is being passed right now in several states to start to try to stop, to prohibit with these guys are doing my filming under cover, so it's. Yeah, I've seen that. How has, how, how's that flying? How are they allowing people to do that? Because everyone is outraged when they see those videos. Even the media, they watched those videos of people. Like I saw one of this abuse that was going on with these cows were the sky was like hitting a cow with a crowbar and it's there. So horrific. And again, another thing is being exposed by technology. I believe that that video could

Speaker 3:          03:00          have very well come from the guy that we feature. Um, he's sort of the main one of the biggest undercover animal rights activist and blur out his face or his voice. But we definitely heard his. Actually he has, he's had, I don't know how many name changes throughout his life and this, he's been doing it for 10 years and he's sort of a few ever want to do any undercover filming. This is the guy who needs to talk to him. And he actually gave me some training because a lot of all of this show is about undercover filming. He gave me some training into filming undercover. He sent me out into the parking lot and told me that first I had to go to that woman over there. She's a perfect stranger and you have to ask her. You have to get information from her.

Speaker 3:          03:39          I want to know where she lived before she lived here and I had to go and do that and I passed that really easily, but then the second test that he made me do was I had to go out there and make a woman sort of run away from me because she was scared and I'm not very good at that. I'm good at getting information from people, but I can't. It's not in my nature to be mean or scary or intimidating. And so I went to a parking lot and I just started acting wild, crazy and not really scary. Just crazy. Like where is water? Where can I find some water? People were just staring at me with this crazy woman probably thinking that was on bath salts.

Speaker 3:          04:17          Are they trying to get you to do all this? So this is part of the training is that you have to be able to make people feel either very comfortable with you so they give you information that you need, that you want to get for your, for your undercover filming or very uncomfortable with you so that you feel the need to either leave. So you can fill more or intimidating to a point, intimidated to the point that you will release any information you give without actually resorting to violence obviously. So it was really, it was really an interesting little practice that we had with them.

Speaker 2:          04:45          It's an amazing how much people identify with their genitals because there's a thing that women hate more than not want more than anything was left. I mean that's a massive generalization that has taught myself. But there's one thing that a lot of women really do not appreciate. And that's stinky pussy jokes. You know, you could talk about your stinky feet, who can talk about a girl. Stinky feet, can talk about a girl's breath. You can talk about our girls, but you can't talk about a girl stinky pussy to them. You can lose a lot of people that don't like when you talk about it. Even onstage, really like, yes, yes, yes. I've seen someone do a stinky pussy joke and I've seen women in the audience going, oh, come on. Just upset that you put that possibility out there. I've never smelled a bed fucking pussy like coke.

Speaker 2:          05:35          No, I'm a fucking gets that. If I pick up a chick at a bar, she's drugged. I'm thinking, I'm like that thick. Take a shower. I just won't help us. But I got my finger banged that girl and I'm in Idaho falls. And then being an American Indian I finger, she had those daisy dukes was triple night is and I'm all warmed up. I got like $32. I got no blow. I'm drinking budweiser fucking furious and I'm dancing on it and she's letting me touch her Joe Rogan and I stick my hand in like this way, like full finger, lose my fucking Twat. And I had that fucking yoga look at size and I was bringing her this way, you know a Bruce Lee, you know, I was like Mikey and I took it out. I could. I was dancing with it. I could smell my hand and that was it. I've met by just go do something and you can't get it off. Do you know that the smell of fish is actually from old come usually. So if it's a really strong fish smelled, that means there's common side of her. That's funny because that's what my ball's always smelled like if I jerk off and don't wipe up. Smells like fish.

Speaker 2:          06:50          So realizing I used to take ladies about my own jazz. I shoot, she did my pubes and pull my underwear. I buy away. I've done that dozens of times in my life to shoot of. I jerk off, I just shoot a load on my pubes. I don't even bother cleaning now, but I just pull my underwear up. I do that. I'm in the house. I'm like, as long as it's covered, whatever we give a fuck. If I'm in the whole town by myself, I'll get who cares on the bed and laid on it. I don't give a fuck fuck fucking all day. It's. I thought about it. This is my little tropical helmet juice. But you're a fucking human being.
