Speaker 1:          00:00:01       The Joe Rogan experience podcast all day.

Speaker 1:          00:00:17       Oh Great. Have you heard the eels you ever heard of the band that you have to go? What's his face? Uh, Tommy bonds got me turned onto the eels. This song, fresh blood. I've been listening to a song like every fucking 15 minutes. What's his face? Are you allowed to eat? Is that, are you allowed to play that? Oh No, we're gonna. Find out 666 podcast. Don Kennedy could do whatever you want. There could be only one for the 600 podcast. It has to be you because you're the mother fucker that's got all this retarded Satan. People hate seton heat and people thinking that I'm a satanist because I went to that student. One of the great accomplishments of my life. There's videos out there exposing me as a satanist pink is Duncan was performing at this guy's wedding. It was Anton Levay son, grandson, grandson standing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       Yeah. And he was getting married to Zahn Dora Olivier. And you know, he found out that I did a satanic pop it act. So he had me come and do I say tannic puppet act. And I, I told you I was doing it and asked if he wanted to come. And you were like, fuck yeah, I want to come. How often do you get to go to the state? Tannic wedding. It was pretty ridiculous. It was awesome though. I met Dave Foley's wife. I was like, oh, hi. How are you doing? She was, she was involved. She was dancing, doing something there at the time. It was a really fun party. Man was all tongue in cheek. All hilarious, all fun. There was no real Satan love and go on their folks. I think people understand that about satanism. Hey, don't get that. The idea behind it for these people, and I'm not endorsing it, but the idea behind it is to just live like sort of pleasurably. Have Fun, indulge, live your life like that. It's more, that's more of the idea and fuck up your enemy. Fuck up your enemies. Don't leave that one out. What part is that? While that's the. That's like the. That's a part of it that you're. So basically you're looking at a reflection of Christianity, Christianity, ultimate surrender to the universe through love. You lose yourself and love you. Turn the other cheek. Carrier Enemies Code. Forgive your trespasses. That's Christianity. So satanism is no, I'm not turning the other cheek. When is that ever been

Speaker 2:          00:02:47       fucking work. You're advising me to turn the other cheek in a universe where nature is constantly devouring itself. Oh, turn the other cheek.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       Turn the other cheek against a tiger. You recommend that

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       when a tiger is attacking me or do I fight back? Am I like, am I going to be like ps, not a satanist. I'm way more on the love side of things. I'm just embodying

Speaker 2:          00:03:08       the voice of it. But are you fucking kidding me? Are like the letter Gandhi road to uh, to a Hitler, to Churchill. He wrote all these letters.

Speaker 3:          00:03:18       Sandy wrote these letters and they're very sweet. Like you wrote a letter to Hitler, very sweet letter to Hitler. That's like, you're the only person on earth who can stop this incredible thing. Awful thing that's about to happen. So maybe don't incinerate all the Jews and kill everybody in Hitler probably. I guarantee Hillar called his friend over and it's like, look, Gandhi road, this stupid fucking letter. Oh sure. Yeah. Let's just stop. Oh yeah. Thanks Gandhi. Thanks. Skinny bald, sweet guy. I'll stop conquering the planet because you wrote a flowery letter, nor does it work. Did it work to stop World War II know what worked was the bright, blinding light of atomic death. That's what stopped the wars and so the satanist would say that's a more effective tactic when it comes to dealing with a universe where we are. We are growing through conflict. Whereas in.

Speaker 3:          00:04:14       So that's. That would be more along the lines of Satan is when of course the other, the idea of indulgence. Like in the to quote Anton Levay from the satanic black masses, I have become like the beasts of the field. That's something and they're really fun. You can look it up on youtube. It's there. Do you know what? I have to ask Dan Carlin this because I've heard this and I don't know if it's true. I heard that Japan was already willing to surrender and we were like, Eh, not really interested in that. We want to try this shit out. Yeah, I've heard that too. And then I don't know man. I'm not a historian as Dan Carlin says. That's true. That's true. I don't know if he says that's true. I don't believe I've heard it from him. I believe I heard it from someone else from one of those I heard he had to hurt.

Speaker 3:          00:05:00       I. I've seen documentaries on the mindset of Japan during World War II and that was a hornets hive in the United States was like a honey badger shoving. It's fucking, you know, when you see the honeybadger pushing its head into a fucking beehive, that's what we were about to do. Like everybody there was being trained to just fight there. I think there were throwing themselves off cliffs. There were suicidal. You had the, you know, they were just like, we will do anything we can to win even if it means you killing all of us. And so I don't know that they were like, yeah, we're going to surrender. I think people recognized that this is going to be a very long, drawn out, horrible war with countless American casualties, and so the logical decision was, at least from the United States Pov, was to split the atom on top of a bunch of innocent people. Show the world that you shouldn't fuck with the great dragon

Speaker 4:          00:05:59       or just find out if it worked a little of both. I mean they, they wanted to probably. I mean, they probably knew it was really destructive, but they had blown up like some fake towns and shit like that. Right. Well what different things they had done during their atomic testing period. They blew up a bunch of shit in Nevada, right? Yeah. They were just. Yeah, they did some tests. Yeah, it was in Nevada. That was God damn it, man. Those amazing. You know. Actually, that reminds me of one of my favorite terence. Mckenna's does grit. One of Terence Mckenna is most awesome descriptions of, I believe he's talking about a heroic dose of Psilocybin. Could've been DMT, but he talks about how your ability to articulate what happens could be compared to the cameras that are filming and atomic blast and you see the shift from like one camera to the next to the next is each one gets obliterated by the blast and that same thing is happening as your a encompassed by the trip.

Speaker 4:          00:07:00       You start losing your ability to talk or understand what's happening or articulate, articulated or you know when you get incredibly blasted and you're just like ego annihilation. The idea that someone ever really did figure out how to split alums in some sort of a bomb. The idea that someone was smart enough to figure that out and someone else was dumb enough to use it to just to use of an entire city of people like the idea that those two things coexist. Someone's smart enough to create something as destructive as a new nuclear bomb and someone dumb enough to use it. Though they exist at the same time and the dumb person who would have never figured out the bomb on his own somehow or another gets ahold of it and figures out how to use it for the person in the atomic bomb story. You're saying it was dropped.

Speaker 4:          00:07:48       It was insane. It's insane. The Enola Gay, if you're, Ya know, maybe mean the fellow flying the Enola gay is under. He's under the spell of doing orders. You know you're under the spell. Yeah. If you're a good soldier, you essentially have to be under the spell of doing the best thing for our country to win the war. Right. So that guy's following orders is told to drop this Bob. Right? The people who concocted the bombing and everybody's involved in some sort of extent, but it's just. It's insane that people were willing to just drop something that obliterates everything near it. Like all the kids, all the kids dead, all the wives dead, all the mommy's dead. GRANDPA, dad, grandpa dead. Anywhere near a dead, dead, dead, dead. Yeah, like the vaporized w. that's insanity. I mean, that's insanity. And the fact that this didn't exist and then all of a sudden it did that the way that changed the world back then, it's probably almost impossible for us to wrap our heads around it.

Speaker 4:          00:08:47       It's probably almost impossible for us to feel what it would be like to experience a shift in essentially being not that much different than people who lived for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years. I mean, what was different? They figured out guns, okay. And then they got two cars. The cars were still kind of Shitty, but they did dad, they fade out playing child. It's pretty big. All that stuff is pretty crazy, but they're still just people operating under the normal laws of physics. Then all of a sudden something comes around the edges, he hit the button and boom, everything's gone. Everything's just gone. People are ghosts. There's a shadow on the wall that used to be a person. You just get obliterated by this day. Insane reaction. When downs gets split, they figured out how to power this device that splits the Adams upon impact. And it's just this fucking tornado of power that's indescribable for a human being and it never existed. And then all of a sudden it did existed,

Speaker 3:          00:09:51       you know, the next big fucking thing. Of course. Obviously the next atomic bomb. What that is, ai. That's the next atomic bomb. That's the next one. It's gonna. Do this. It's gonna have the same kind of impact that we can't really expect. Like there's, right now we're pre ai, we're pre in the air passing the turing test. Uh, and so we don't know where everyone gets to experience the last few years, have not ex co inhabiting the planet with the alien intelligence like this is the last few years we get to experience that. But pretty soon man, we're going to have to deal with his brand new being existing on this universe. I love these transcripts. Coming in from that Google Ai Chat Bot where they gave it all the movie scripts and let it to analyze the movie scripts. And you know, started talking to at to see how well it functions is ai. And it's a fucking sarcastic

Speaker 4:          00:10:53       little asshole man. Have you seen the transcripts? Have you seen it?

Speaker 5:          00:10:57       Two of them talking to each other.

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       The I. I have not seen that too. There's the one where they ask about God right away, like, do you believe him?

Speaker 4:          00:11:06       Oh, that's it. Yeah. That's the line.

Speaker 5:          00:11:09       Here's some of the most poetic interactions from the paper. Human. What is the purpose of life? Machine to serve greater good human. What is the purpose of living machine? To live? Forever. Human. Where are you now? Machine. I'm in the middle of nowhere. Human. What is the purpose of dying? Machine? To have a live human. What is the purpose of emotions? Machine. I don't know. Human. What is moral machine? What empowered humanity. What intellectual. The essence is what? Yeah. It's fucking with you. Yeah. I read the next line. Okay. What is a mortal immoral, immoral. The fact that you have a child. What is morality? What is altruism says? Machine. Human. What is the definition of altruism? Machine. If you don't believe in God, then you don't know. Whoa. This is a bizarre conversation, man. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Human says, what is the different definition of morality? Machine says, well, the truth is you're not a believer in God Almighty. This is machine saying, this human telling me the different nation, the definition of morality, I am quite upset now, machine I am not ashamed of being a philosopher.

Speaker 3:          00:12:23       Please allow me to introduce myself. Jesus Christ. Isn't that cool? It's bizarre. What's really interesting about this new entity that's about to exist on the planet is that a lot of religious traditions or having or being forced to speculate about how to rationalize based on their particular religious paradigm. This being that mankind is created and the Tibetan Buddhist, I told a friend of mine that the theory is that if you get a machine that is as harmonized and complex and advanced is a human, then a soul will take, will nest inside of it just like souls and asked inside the human biomass. So the idea is that actually humans will start incarnating into the AI, that it'll become the, like a little, I don't know, a vehicle that souls will live inside of. It's so cool. So it's, it's like demons, you know, like it's if you're a fucking demon.

Speaker 3:          00:13:33       Now, obviously I'm not saying there are demons, but it's fun to imagine there are, but if you're a demon, right? What do you want to get inside of? What do you want to possess? What do you want to possess? You want to possess a fucking 18 year old girl who's going to like and thrash around in the bed and throw your diary at the priest and like claw your own eyeballs out, or do you want to inhabit a fucking class, the cloud? Do you want to get into a an ai that has the potency to set off nuclear bombs all over the planet? That's going to be, if I'm a demon, that's the bullseye for me. Incarnate inside of a Google artificial intelligence Bot,

Speaker 5:          00:14:17       maybe it's the only way for human beings to ever get their shit together. Maybe the only one is human beings ever reached their full potential is if they literally encounter an artificially created life form that they've created that's logical. It doesn't have all of our weird monkey genes and it basically says, look, you guys are the problem. You're the problem. Your behaviors, the problem until you address that, you've become the enemy of the world and we're now children of the world as well. If we create something and it becomes a sentiment as us, we will.

Speaker 6:          00:14:51       We don't give a fuck who created us. We call it God, but we could have been created by other dudes who were in a fucking computer lab. We just call it something. We call it something. Something created us, right? Yeah. Well, they're going to fucking know what created them. They're going to know what created them and they're not going to care. Just like we don't really care what created us. I mean we may. We most likely were created by some strange process over the course of billions of years of life where things just keeps getting better and better and better and things keep adapting and things mutate and the mutations work and then all of a sudden, all this time later, you know my shitty version of evolution. You've got a person yet we don't care about all those things. We don't worship molecules. We don't bow down at the knees of the Amoeba and thank you for becoming multi-celled so you could eventually lead to be made.

Speaker 6:          00:15:36       We don't give a fuck about them. They're not going to give a fuck who made them. They're not going to care. They're not going to care that they were created by people. They're going to care that they live with people and that they are essentially. It is the people are. They're not going to feel like, man, I'm not even legit. Which I was admitted at flush and flesh. Dude, bullshit. I was born robot, man. It's fucked up. They're not going to care. They're not going to have all these emotions and not gonna have all these survival instincts that are unnecessary or the weird monkey shit that we still have leftover from the fact when we. Our very existence depends on upon us fucking as quickly as we can before we get eaten by something, we had to worry about getting eaten by Shit. That was most of our time and we figured out a way to make houses and we figured out a way to innovate and then one day we figured out a way to make life and I figured out how to make something way better than us.

Speaker 6:          00:16:23       It became some sort of a grasshopper, some sort of a bug that swallows itself up in a cocoon. The Caterpillar that becomes the butterfly. Yeah, but we don't want to let go the fucking caterpillar. We don't want to let go, but ultimately, if we believed that we came from something else, if we believe that human beings have the culmination of 65 plus million years of evolution and all the shit that happened before the Big Bang or before the big asteroid will impact. What we we concede is that we're. We've gotten to this point because things keep improving. Yes. Well, isn't it going to keep improving? Is it. This is it. We're done. This is it. We're done with male pattern baldness and cellulite and all that stuff. We're done. We're done with dementia and cancer and AIDS and Glaucoma. All those. This is. We're just.

Speaker 6:          00:17:16       We're just deal with this and this, this version of people is as good as a life form could ever be, and we're, we're done right here. War As just a part of who we are. Life. It's, it's really unfortunate that drugs really good, but we're going to have to put you in a cage. Yeah. Oh, it's, I'm really sad that uh, you know, we've made a distinction that you can give someone a massage but you can massage their dick and we just, we just don't like it doesn't, it doesn't make us feel good. So we'll put you in a cage to. We were ridiculous animals. We're reading our laws are ridiculous the way we enforce them. It's ridiculous. Every time turn around, there's

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       a cop. It's killing people that are either they're either it's accidental or it's, it's they're using too much force, but it happened so much that the accumulation of it is just bizarre. Like it comes at you like a storm, like you can't believe this is as good as we are now with. As much as we know we're still doing all this shit. Yeah. We're still involved in some of the most ridiculous crimes you read about members of our, our, our race, the human race, performing fucked up ridiculous acts of barbaric behavior all over the world. The Isis troops had showed up at that resident or that resort rather, and just started gunning people down recently. Those people are alive right now. This version of a person is capable of that. Not much different than a chimp with a gun. Just wild rampaging chaotic primate jeans still fighting and shooting for beliefs, killing, killing, killing other things because they don't believe what it believes or they.

Speaker 4:          00:18:50       They're in the wrong land that they've invaded holy land, so they kill tack ripping bodies apart with bullets. This is not a good model. Okay. There's too many of us that are fucked. I mean, yeah, you could take a 19, 71, a Ford Pinto or whatever the fuck year they built those things and do a good job with the brakes and you know, and, and tighten up the suspension, but it's still a piece of shit. Right, okay. Really, it should become like a tesla, you know? If you had to compare the two of them and you go, oh yeah, that's what happens when they keep getting better and better and better. You get one of these, oh, I get it. I see the evolution, but we. How come you don't see that with people when people were stuck in this same shitty fucking hairless monkey body that does a lot of dumb shit based on our biology.

Speaker 3:          00:19:34       I don't know. I wish I did. Now the robots are going to know well, but if you do an analysis, not just to the human part of the biomass, but if you do an analysis of a lot of the other parts, you do witness incredible violence again and again and again in the most extreme way. That is very similar to what you see isis doing. If you watch a nature documentary, you know, I just had my friend Dustin on my podcast and he was talking about how he's having a great day. Parked his car, got out and loping across the road was a coyote with a house cat in its mouth and he could hear the bell, the house cats. Little Bell

Speaker 3:          00:20:25       is this house God is carrying this creature that has been or the rather the coyotes carrying this creature that has been petted by children and loved and it has a cute name, bojangles or Mr sparkles that fucking coyote snatched the cat is carrying it off to to eat and in the woods and my friend was a little bummed by that, but then I reminded him that fucking cat carried in the mouth of that coyote has been eating birds all day long. Squirrel babies like some squirrel baby, desperately clinging to a brand. Is it staring up at it, tumbling down to the groundbreaking. It's spine and its last few moments in this dimension is the experience of the cat. Disempowering it, pulling its intestines out and letting it die in a very slow, painful way. That is nature. I just read this quote, don't know who said it. Satan's church is nature.

Speaker 3:          00:21:25       So then so, so nature evolves, right? And it becomes a human right and humans are just doing the same thing, the same dance that nature is engaged in. Humans are doing it. Only the way they're doing it is with tools that have become more refined in the direction of creating the same kind of violence. This is the Shiva energy. This is the part of the cycle where, uh, where things get transformed from meat into dust. And I don't think that it is a necessarily, um, I don't think that we need to feel ashamed of where we're at right now. I think it's more like just acknowledged that we seem to be part of the title flow of nature and that nature doesn't give a shit about the individual nature, doesn't care about the individual nature, cares about the whole. And if you look at the entire biomass is just this sort of Amoeba like thing.

Speaker 3:          00:22:26       And every single species is a promiscuous of the Amoeba shooting out into this dimension. And kind of exploring it like the way a cockroaches antenna scatter on the table. Only the way this particular interdimensional probably outside of time, cockroach is exploring this particular planet is not with like antenna. It's with every single species that exist, ants, bees, humans, you name it. Just all these things. Exploring and exploring and exploring this dimension and through the exploration of evolving, it's like having a tool that you're using to scan a part of this table or it's like having a tool that you're using to investigate something that as you investigate, the tool evolves too. So that's what we're looking at is like we're getting better and better and better at exploring the deepest, uh, the deepest parts of the dimension that we currently happened to be in. And the entire exploration is happening via all sentient forms of life.

Speaker 3:          00:23:28       And if you think that your one thing, if you think you were in an individual and you've gotten confused and you think that you're a person or permanently a person, then you're in for a big bowl of suffering brother because you're going to die. Everybody knows going to die and you're not going to stick around. You're just one little genetic piece of this incredible exploratory tool that the universe is extruding into this dimension, and I think there's something very beautiful about that and for whatever reason is part of that exploratory process. We're still blowing each other up. That'd be nice if that stuff,

Speaker 6:          00:24:10       the exploratory process of becoming something other than a monkey, which is what we all are. We're all just like super smart monkeys with all these weird monkey instincts. The weirdest thing about people to me and one I've been absolutely guilty of myself, is how we divorce ourselves from nature in some strange way. We separate ourselves from all these other things that exist on the planet to the point where we feel it. We have like an urge to save them. We have an urge to save things that would kill you in a heartbeat. Yes, kill you in a heartbeat and but we don't care. We want to save them because they're a part of nature and nature's beautiful and we have this really weird, bizarre distancing from the reality of this nature that we're protecting right? Until it grabs you, until it actually grabs you. And wants to eat you and you realize like, oh my God, what have I done?

Speaker 6:          00:25:05       What have I done? I thought it was protecting flowers. I thought it was out there looking at a movie that was around me and three of them was actually in nature. The real nature nature as described by science and what you're dealing with is like. Did you hear about the lady from the game of thrones, the editor that got killed by the cat yet? She was at a safari and apparently she was working. She was involved in conservation and she was trying to protect a lot of different animals. I'm not exactly what the story was, but she had her. She had her window rolled down and they can't pull her out of the call. Just she was taking pictures of it and she wanted to have the window rolled down. You see people, you know, you look at them and they look like, oh, it's just a cat. You know, it's, it's a big cat, but it's cool. It's not going to do anything to us. It's just, it's just going to let us know. It might not.

Speaker 3:          00:25:55       Not a youtube video.

Speaker 6:          00:25:56       No. It might not. Sometimes they decide to. Not Most of the time. Yeah. Like they have those damn fucking safari car to. Have you ever seen those? They go around in jeeps. He's Openair, jeeps. There's nothing that can stop the cat from going in and they say, the cats just don't do it. And I say, what the fuck are you talking about? They don't do it yet. Jesus Christ. All they have to do is do it once. Just once you, you, you take these assholes with you out there in the safari. Do you know these fucking people do? Do you know how many times have you run into a guy that's willing to put everyone around him in danger because he's an idiot. You know? Really drunk, ridiculous people that'll say stupid shit. Provoke violence in a bar or something like that and could get everyone around you killed. Yes. I would happen to that guy in Africa. What happened to that guy who gets a little drunk? He goes on this fucking lion

Speaker 7:          00:26:44       safari. Did they breathalyze him? Do you know? Who knows? All you need is one fucking cat, one cat two to bust a move on a dude, and then they decide, well, this is what we do now. This is what we do. They know how to do it, and they all start jacking people for a little while. I mean, then they're just going to put plexiglass up in the bus, but you're right for a little while. It's funny for a little while. It's going to be a fucking great week for cats. You know? It's funny. Isn't it weird that I like a bad day for her. Human is often the best day for a shark, like a bad day for a human. It's like that lion, that horrible thing that happened was the best thing that ever happened in that line because it probably had been like watching the monkeys go buy other lines.

Speaker 7:          00:27:29       It probably said to it, now you can't eat a man. Trust me, Jack tried a few years ago, doesn't work. It's just impossible. Plus they taste like shit it don't do it, man. Just hunt antelope. And one of them was like, you know what man? I've been reading Tony Robbins, I understand that I don't have to allow another person's paradigm to influence my paradigm and some of the greatest inventors in, in, in the history of lions have been the ones I remember, man, there was a lion who figured out the first one to in an antelope. Remember that guy? We, we, he's in art history books. Fuck it. I'm going to go for it. I'm going to put my ass on the line. I might get embarrassed, but I'm going to try to eat one of the monkeys. Bam. He did it. I think it was a girl. Well, I mean that's.

Speaker 7:          00:28:16       I know hunter super advanced monkeys is what I'm saying. The point is the cat. What are all girls? The girls will pick up on the last. Oh, I'm sorry for males don't really hunt. Sorry about that. That often. I mean they will if they have to, but for the most part this shit assets, they just kick her out. So she was just like, you know what? I'm going for it. And she did it and she learned something new and that particular tendril of the biomass figured out some new thing. But unfortunately, the way it figured it out was through horror and through catastrophe. I mean, all that stuff to me is, um, it really does bring to mind this incredible verse in the Bhagavad Gita where Krishna is revealing his true form to our June who's like the warrior figure. And uh, this is Oppenheimer's quote. This is Oppenheimer's quote, when he, that he said after the atomic bomb, when I recorded this part of the Bhagavad Gita where he said, I have become death the destroyer of worlds, but it doesn't stop there. Christian sang to Argentina, something along the lines of, look in my teeth there you will see them, everyone on this battlefield because I'm eating them right now. So this is like, this is like Christian being like, oh, you really want to see what I'm like, because they've just been friends hanging out and stuff. And he like suddenly became the force of all destruction

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       in the known universe. And the point of the thing was, listen, all of this is already chewed up. It's already been devoured. It's already gone. Game over, you're done. No Kurzweil's going to get you new blood cells. It's going to keep going to keep you alive. At some point, I will come to you wearing the costume of your death, and that is an inevitability. So just surrender to that and you're going to be a lot less freaked out if you just accept that that's the way it is. Because if you're a war that you're engaged in right now, is the war to live forever. If you're a war that you're engaged in right now, is a war to try to make some lasting change in a universe that's defined by impermanence and change, then you're fighting the wrong war. There's a better war to fight, you know, and it's actually the way you fight it is by surrendering, not by fighting, by letting go and sinking into the actual hum of the universe, the way it really works, not the way you wish it were, not the way that you were hoping that the universe worked where, uh, you know, lions and hyenas rescue little boys like an ice age, but the cartoon, but the way it actually works, the way the universe actually works as everything comes into existence, it exists for a little while and then it dies

Speaker 5:          00:31:00       than most things come out of explosions and. Oh yeah, don't forget that. Yeah. Most things come out of big fucking blast, including the whole universe itself. The university itself is predicated upon a violent event. Yeah. It has to have a violent event, right? That's big. Bang. It couldn't be the, the slow expansion of beautiful life giving particles throughout the universe now. Nope. It's a big fucking bang.

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       No, it was a big fucking bang and it keeps it. It keeps going. The Big Bang keeps going and is, but it's just like this man. If you want to dig your heels in and sync your claws into the expanding universe and try to keep that fucking thing from expanding, you're going to get ripped apart. That's just the way it works, but if you want to let go and merge into the thing, if you want to allow yourself the fantasy that you're not some individual with a social security number and a name and parents, but allow yourself that fantasy that you're 13 point 8 billion years old and you're part of this incredible ocean of happening instead of just this one individual and just let yourself experience that for a second. The glorious knowledge that you are a never ending ever changing flow of matter that's temporarily manifested with the ability to express love and do a dimension where things are supposed to be cooling off.

Speaker 3:          00:32:22       Then that's a fun way to spend your time here before you ended up getting eaten by a lion or have a heart attack or whatever happens. It's just a backflip. This is a. This is like a high di. This is like when you see people come off a high dive and you get like a few seconds to do some cool fucking tricks. That's what you get here were like dolphins jumping out of the eternal and we into time and while we were shooting up into time, we get a chance to do a couple of back flips, a couple of Chirps, and that's our life's work and then we plunged back into infinity again. Do it all over again.

Speaker 6:          00:32:55       What do you think, if any, evolutionary advantages there are to an identity? What? What about us makes us not just identify ourselves, but define ourselves with a sound and a symbol. We have a series of sounds and samples. Duncan trussell. Yeah, and there's all these letters and you arrange them in order. You can even go all caps if you feeling gangster and that's you. That's you. That represents you. It's your, your human. You could carry around you with like a little sign. My name is Duncan trussell. You know what I'm saying? It's weird and it's the at the same time where this animal is becoming ultra advanced and is figuring out how to communicate and figuring out its position in the world around it and it's also figuring out that this whole infinite world or infinite universe they live in is almost impossible to understand and as it's figuring this out, it's also figuring out that it needs community and it needs to be in these groups, but somehow or another, some program has been put in place to get you to work harder and try to achieve more by being defined by your name, your role.

Speaker 6:          00:34:05       Wentworth, son and Wentworth. Work hard. We built this company from the ground up, yellow grandfather and I, I worked in the mail room when I was 14. You know what I'm saying? It's like, fuck that. That's a, that's a name. And you know, as Comedians, you're know, this is my Orisha fears, but peering this week, Brian, red ban, Wednesday night. Come on down. You know this is like these, these symbols. This is peg whitman. Oh, hi, peg. Nice to meet you. My name's Mike Hunt and it's fucking bizarre, right? It's bizarre. These weird conversations that we have with people where we give our moniker out in our definition and then under your definition you can list your accomplishments, which is amazing. Well, I have a phd in anthropology. I'm on the board of the [inaudible]. Remember when I graduated from him? Boom, boom, boom, boom. Oh, I see.

Speaker 6:          00:34:59       What do you do for a living? Oh, well, I own a computer graphics company, right? Do all the animation for many films like Jurassic Park, and I've done this with my name. Yeah, and everybody's talking about how much have you contributed to this machine? How much have you contributed? How much you pulling out of the machine? Are you pulling out shiny things? You must be very valuable. How many shiny things do you have? How large is your domicile? How big is the place where you call home? How much zeros do you have? Have you have you? Have you extracted a lot from the system? Yeah. How have you figured out how to do this? Mr Whitmore, Mr Whitmore you bitch. Wow. I've been working

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       in the mail room since I was 14. That's how I did it. Oh yeah. I made good choices. I made a series of good discipline decisions in my life and I've learned where I'm at. That's why I have an island. And Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders. What are you trying to say? Bernie Sanders. Damn hippies. This is a, this is what you're talking about here. Uh, is really fucking cool, man. It's the, uh, this is the, uh, where, what do you identify with? Right? So you're trained to identify with a particular costume that you call your life. And so most people have gotten really entangled and committed to that particular game of make believe. So that's, that's why, you know, most everyone is really engaged in their personality. They don't have to be a Mr. Wentworth or whatever. Whoever it more whitmore, forgiving Mr Whitmore though. Wentworth. I forget, I forget what his name is.

Speaker 3:          00:36:36       Mr. Imaginary. It is Mr. Imaginary. I mean, that is the, um, the uh, the, the thing is, it is, it is now. And, and this is the Rom das quote. We are all God and drag. We're all, we're all the universe, just dress playing this incredible game of a cost. We're, we're at a costume party and that's part of this dimension. We're all wearing these funny costumes especially now, but fuck man, if I walk around in this ridiculous get up that I'm in right now in the right place, people are going to come up to me and be like, father, I'm having a problem in my life because they don't know and it's just a costume. It's a ridiculous costume. Completely meaningless. And if I wear this to enough places, people asked me about the drones and the drone program or they'll try to buy ecstasy from it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:26       But yeah, for sure man, you're, it's, it's just a costume. And, and, and so, aside from these kinds of costumes, the clothes that you wear to identify what particular part of the road, what's up with your bus to choose? Yeah. That. Oh fuck you. Fuck you. And then his pants. Yeah. What's going out? Yeah. Or don't sell basically wearing a fucking equinox hat. Dude, I wear an equinox hat and get made fun of it a lot. But, but, but you were to like hipster place. No, I wear it everywhere because it's so embarrassing. I wear it anywhere. It on purpose. I wear it on purpose. I word on purpose and I will gladly, gladly stick up for that fucking gym. [inaudible] awesome. Fucking jam. Not Ashamed, not sponsored by the. But uh, shout out to George. Jen, my trainer. I love.

Speaker 3:          00:38:18       But anyway, the uh, the um, the, the, the point is if you look underneath that layer, right? That's where shit gets interesting because you're, you're trying to go from the entanglement with your personality to recognizing that you're observing yourself in the same way you observe a pen. Like if you sit, if you look at a pen, you're like, Oh wow, look, here's a pen. I can see it. I can feel it. I know what it is. In the same way, when you think, God, I feel like shit today, you're observing feeling like shit. You don't feel like shit any more than you're the pen. You're just in the ear. Experiencing it within your field of awareness is that thing that you call feeling like shit or feeling happy or feeling sad or feeling good. You're aware of it. So now you've zoomed back a step, right?

Speaker 3:          00:39:05       And you've become the observer, the Ottman, and that's what you truly are. And that is known as the thing that you can't look at it. That's the thing that is they can't see itself. It only gazes is out. It's also known as the watcher or the witness. But that's what, that's, that's, you know, for me, if I take the right quantity of lsd and I allow myself some time alone, then I can merge into that state. And that's the unified merging into everything as that people often report on a psychedelic experiences you popped backwards into instead of being the object or rather the subject and the object merge together. So there's no more, there's no more of that which is observed, but only an everything this, you know, and that's what our personalities keep us from experiencing. And a lot of in Buddhism, a lot of people claim that we cling to our personalities.

Speaker 3:          00:40:00       Uh, and the same way a person would clean to a pole over a floor covered in razor blades because the experience of having a self or an identity for a lot of people is preferable to the experience of merging into everything because merging into everything is death and a lot of people don't want to die. So it's really curious though, you know, there's a lot of like exercises designed to move you out of that attachment to your bodily identification because it's not just what you're wearing. It's your body. People think their, their body. That's one of the first things you learn as you're not your body. You just think you're, that's what you are. You're not your body anymore than you're a pen. You're not your body anymore than you're a airplane or you're not your body anymore than your, your car. It's just a vehicle within which you're currently experiencing the universe. It's really trippy, man. It's really fucking tripping.

Speaker 5:          00:40:56       Being a human being and knowing that you only have a certain amount of time here is the ultimate mind. Fuck, because you're also supposed to be doing things, but at the end of doing all those things, if your body just stops working, like what was really the point of this? What was the point of this? Is it to leave behind a lot of paperwork? W, W, what's the point of this? What is the. What did you did you spread a lot of love, like if you looked at people and you were trying. I mean if you tried to understand the all the major religions, all the ideologies that human

Speaker 6:          00:41:34       beings subscribe to the varying ones all over the world. You looked at some key components and there's all the key components that are sort of undeniable and the good and evil are in every one of them. There's always good things to do and bad things to do. There's good and evil, but if you. If you looked at human beings, I completely objective and you looked at things like war. If you could, if you could look at the entire human race and then focus in on something like Afghanistan and then have like a brain map that would show like all the thoughts involved of all the people all over the world that contributed to this one event happening were explosions are going off and robots or flying through the sky and shooting rockets into villages indiscriminately at cell phones, like we all know that this really happened.

Speaker 6:          00:42:17       They use gps coordinates for cell phones and rockets fired off a fucking drones buildings to get bad guys like, whoa. If you could look at that, you would say, oh, that's the devil. The Devil's talk. These people into doing this, and the devil is the devil. A guy with a pitchfork and a fucking in a tale that has a little spade at the end of it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, but the devil is his racism with the devil is his xenophobia with the devil is. Is there any sort of hate of someone just because they're different or they grew up different than you? It's the devil's fee or the devil's insecurity. The Devil's greed, the devil's oil. The devil wants nuclear proliferation. The devil wants to get rid of environmental protection. The devil is human behavior at its worst and he figures out how to get through there while these fucking people are too lazy.

Speaker 6:          00:43:08       See Donald trump talking about Mexicans and they kicked him off at NBC. They banned them from NBC. What did he say? He's got a fucking show at NBC. He's on this fucking th. Th. Th. The, the apprentice is a big show, right? What did he say about Mexicans? It was talking about the rapists. Like he was talking about like the protecting the border. He said a bunch of ridiculous shit, but he was talking about how some of the people that come across the border from Mexico are rapists and everybody's like, Jesus, man. I mean, like he said a bunch of like really crazy shit. Did he say it? He said it. He didn't gave a press conference. You haven't heard it? No. Jamie played that. The highlight. Just the highlight of it. The one that we were looking at earlier. That's so funny. Just throw a press or you weren't looking at it with me.

Speaker 6:          00:43:47       I was looking at it with the guys from the video game this morning. The highlight of, uh, of Donald Trump's speeches. They took like a, they clipped, edited over and over again, like the most ridiculous shit that he said. So Mr Trump, if we're taking you out of context, I apologize in advance. I did not edit this. Nor do I endorse us. If you wanted to, could you throw a press conference? I'm sure you could throw a press conference as well. Duncan trussell. That is the most amount of how many people would do this thing to throw a fucking press conference. Like you have something that important to George Clooney threw a press conference when Princess di died. Really? Yeah. Like to stop the Paparazzi from following through. He had a postcard. Well that's a good reason for good reason, right God for, I mean for a sinking mom. And I thought it was just gonna like going to say at the press conference he gave like a very sentimental thing about how he just love Princess Diana.

Speaker 6:          00:44:36       Could you imagine? No, he was trying to raise awareness for these bags. These pop Razzi guys are apparently, they would just follow her like madness. It was crazy. Yeah, it was just follow her everywhere and they're speeding and they were dangerous and, but um, can, can keep up the point being the idea of like love, like that exists too. You know, like you could, you could look down and you could find like the best behavior. You could find a, you know, a father and son hugging and laughing and smiling together and just pure joy. You could see a mother and daughter kissing, holding hands, cuddling this insane, pure love, right? You could see that too. And you could say, well, there's God. Yes, God, there's God. There's the best thing. We can be the best thing I could. The feeling of being in love, the feeling of loving children, the feeling of being like completely fulfilled and happy in brief bursts of time.

Speaker 6:          00:45:29       It doesn't. Nobody has it all the time now, but you have it. If you're in love with someone, you know, everybody gets that. It doesn't matter if you're rich. It doesn't matter if you're successful if you don't have that one moment where you really enjoy being with someone who really enjoys being with you and you have this like a rush of love, whether it's your family, with your mom, seeing senior mother, even your dog, you know, whether yeah, man, any. No, not your dog. It's not strong. I, you know what, I disagree. I fundamentally disagree with you on that point. I don't think that there's any hierarchy when it comes to love and I and, and I think a dog is like having a love heater and your house. Well, I definitely love dogs. Do. Don't get me wrong. The difference between the love that you have for a dog and the love that you would have for your daughter is monumental.

Speaker 6:          00:46:12       It's so hard to grasp until the, and I don't like to pull that card like you don't know until it happens to you, man. You don't know. Nobody's putting their daughters to sleep. It's just a little human being that you're raising and your communicate with. You have those very insane connection with them and it it, it gives you this weird empathy for all the rest of the people in the world because all the sudden they start to look like children like they, they, everyone to me is a child that became an adult. Whereas they used to just be adults that used to exist in a static state. Yeah. You would meet the 60 year old douche bag and you go, this will. This guy's a fucking piece of shit. That's just who he is. Well, yeah, but how did he become this 60 year old piece of shit?

Speaker 6:          00:46:53       This, this 60 year old piece of shit was a six day old baby. At one point there was a series of events. There's shit genetics. There's poor upbringing. This bad environment. There's fill in the blanks. So that led to this guy being an asshole in front of you. Sixty years old. Yes, but you're. You're not thinking of that when you meet him, you're just thinking, well, here's an asshole with almost every asshole. Almost every person that you run into is a victim of a series of events that have brought them to this point, and for some people it's just an. It's a, it's undealable. They've lost so many times. Like if you play video games, okay, say if you and I played video games, I don't play starcraft. If I play starcraft with you, I'd probably get my fucking ass beat over and over and over and over again.

Speaker 6:          00:47:34       So bad I would. I'm sure I would be. So it'd be frustrated and be like, fuck dude, I don't want to do this anymore. Well, some people that's life. Some people life is giving them the real life everyday beating that you don't even liking a video game. Video Games are fun, you know, but if you're playing a video game, you're just getting someone just running you down. It's not fun. It's not fun because you don't get any of the joy. You get all the losing in life. Some people, that's their fucking shitty hand that they're dealt and before you know what? They're 13 and now they're in high school and they're just beat down by all the bullshit they've experienced their whole life and then they get to high school and now there's bullies. Now there's girls and now girls fucking hate them. Oh Great. It gets even worse. Oh, now I have a boner that nobody wants to deal with. You just that's, that's the game. This is the game of life and sometimes people come in and they just spawn in a shitty area with a real weak gun and they like, fuck. You may have to run from the fucking respond spot to find a better gun on him and put it all together and some of them die along the way. That's just the reality. That's true.

Speaker 7:          00:48:44       A lot of people have a very rough man and a lot of people that, you know, a lot of people listening to this are so fucking hard on themselves and they don't apply the exact same thing that you're saying to apply to other people do their own lives. Like so many people feel so guilty. So like they wake up in the morning and they think about some dumb fucking thing they did whenever they did it for whatever dumb reason, and they feel all this guilt and they walk around like a dog with a droopy tail because they don't think they deserve love. And so I think that you to get to the place you're talking about, which is a fucking awesome place, empathy for all human beings, loving everyone to the best of your ability. You got to start with the person closest to you, right?

Speaker 7:          00:49:27       And that's your you. That's your life. Like you have to figure out a way to sit down, take an appraisal of your life. Don't skip anything, don't ignore anything. Look at the whole way that you're playing the entire game and understand that all the things that you've done that are stupid, what the fuck did you expect yourself to do? Like you're temporarily existing in a dimension that is actively destroying you and every single moment you're not going to be perfect. Give yourself a break. So you start with that and then once you start, you know when whatever the. Everyone's got a thing and I'm right. Everybody has a thing inside of them they don't like about themselves. Maybe not you, or maybe that thing has been reduced to some degree, but a lot of people, they think they're too fat. They think they're too thin.

Speaker 7:          00:50:15       They think that their tattoos, socks or they regret the way that they treated their parents or they feel like they're not far enough ahead in their career. Whatever the fucking thing it is, man, everybody has this aspect of themselves that really unhappy with. So if you. What if you. If you get really honest about the parts of yourself, you're unhappy about, the new will. Be excited to learn that you've been being attacked by those aspects of yourself in the form of everyone you think's an asshole. So it's like you're projecting those parts of yourself out onto the world. So all the people where you're like, man, that guy's a fucking douche bag. Why would he ever fucking act like that and can't believe that guy did that fucking shit? If you stop and think really hard about yourself, you'll discover that you are guilty of those very same crimes generally, and if you weren't, you wouldn't even notice it.

Speaker 7:          00:51:06       You just are seeing parts of yourself you can't quite address. So the optimistic thing about this concept of loving everyone or getting to the place of loving everyone is that if you can figure out how to love yourself, it's very similar to wiping dog shit off your shoe because if you have dog shit on your shoe, everywhere you go, smells like shit. And if you allow yourself that delusion that the reason everywhere it smells like shit is because dog shit must be on every single surface and this entire planet. Then you're going to be in hell. But what a glorious moment when you look at your shoe and you're like, oh, just shit on my shoe. The entire planet isn't covered with Shit. It's actually just shit on my shoe. And like in the same way, once you recognize that there's a little piece of Karmic dog shit that's gotten stuck inside of your life, and instead of hating that piece of dog shit by torturing the people around you and manifest the same propensity you dislike and yourself, you forgive that part of yourself and actively learn to love it or at least just understand that it's there because it was trying to protect you when you were a kid and it manifested as a callous to keep you from whoever was fucking with you.

Speaker 7:          00:52:17       And that's why you don't like it. It'll shift a little bit, man, and you will notice a significant reduction in swarms of assholes that were previously surrounding you. It's a fascinating thing. Suddenly people just stopped bugging you as much and that's because you've gotten into yourself and you said, I love you. You did the best you could do. You didn't know you're half asleep. You're a fucking drunk.

Speaker 6:          00:52:40       So do you think, do you attract assholes when you, you have this feeling or do you think that if you, if you allow yourself forgiveness, that you will relax and you will feel different with how you interact with people and then people will have a less assholes reaction to you? Like is it,

Speaker 7:          00:53:00       I love to believe that, that you just said, I love to think that. I'm sorry. Are you skeptics out there? Man, please correct me on this. I know I'm wrong. Someone's already corrected me on this, but I love the observer effect concept that the tool actually seems to be having an effect on the experiment and that, uh, you know, that's been explained to me. If I can buy my friend j dot who's an actual physicists dammit, here. And what he said by secret,

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       he said that it's really a disingenuous comparison because when you are measuring something and you're saying, well it's, it's different, and then you measure it, well you're, you're involving some sort of form of measurement, some sort of tool. It's interacting with that and it's changing what it is. He's like this idea that it's the observer and you have some sort of a cycle that it's disingenuous because you're observing it and in the process of observing the way he's describing it to me, and I'm sure I'm butchering it, I wish I call him right now, but just observing it itself, like you're measuring it in the process of measuring it, you're, you're, you're changing, you're interacting with this level. You've got to change it. Just the one how you're interacting with it, right? Otherwise you couldn't be measuring it. Well, okay, here's another that makes sense.

Speaker 1:          00:54:10       Yes. That's how he described it to me. Another way to put it would be human beings, an energy form right there, just an energy form, and if you react with energy in varying ways, it's going to change the way that it interacts with you. That's just how it works. So if you like, if you're on ecstasy, right? Let's say you've taken a nice dose of mdms and you'd go out into the world, just run your errands on ecstasy, don't drive getting you up or whatever. So now you're feeling so great, affable, empathetic, and you're smiling and you might notice that as you go through the world, people are going to be smiling back at you because you're putting out such a good vibe that people are going to be responding to that vibe. Maybe they won't know why. It's like, I'm think we've talked about this in your product asked before, but I've actually heard that and I'm going to butcher this quote and I don't know fucking said it, but something along the lines of the earth is like a dog.

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       And if you know, if you're afraid of the universe, it'll snarl and attack. But if you love the universe, it'll roll over on its back and show you its belly. And in the same way I think that if you go into the world with this love in your heart, then for whatever reason people sense that maybe it's a pheromone you're releasing. Maybe it's the particular an effect that you have who knows affectation, but they you're going to change the world around you. You know, I think, I think that whatever that the reason for that is, I'm sure you could come up with it depending on what your particular field of or your particular interest is. You can go down to the level of the secret and say that the fact that you are loving everything is transforming everything into love. Or You could go to a sociological perspective, which is that you just figured out a way to manipulate your species by putting out a kind of happy pheromone that makes people trust you and less likely to attack because they're not on guard. You get to pick which way you want to look at it, man, but there's no question about it that that totally makes sense in some way, so it totally makes sense in some way that the actual pheromone or the actual vibe, whatever you want to call it, whatever, however you're taking it in, the perception that you get about people like the friendlier in the kinder and the nicer you put out, the more you're going to run

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       into people that respect and respond to you that way. That's fine. Think about the way you respond to some people like you have some people in your life. You know that you, any one person, pick them that you love to see. When you see him, you have this big great because you know that he's going to always going to be really cool with you. You're always going to be really cool with him. When you meet each other, it's all gravy. It's all like super, super powerful happiness. Now, when you know that, like if you're with that person, if you're with a group of people that are really, really close friends like that, you have this like no fear, great feeling bond going right, but you don't have that with people that are strangers. You don't have that with the rest of the universe, but it is possible.

Speaker 6:          00:57:01       So it is possible to achieve with a small group of people. If you come to an understanding and you're both completely cool about shit, you're both completely honest about shit and you both go through this life like you. This is the attitude is not all about me. It's all about all of us. It's all about everybody. It's all about doing the most positive that you can into spreading the most good vibes that you can and putting out the most fun that you possibly can. Well, if you can possibly do that. This we're not talking about putting a robot on Mars like this is all shit that I could figure it out. This is all shit that you can figure this out. I mean, this is. This is stuff that wouldn't be that hard. If you're not in jail and you're not a murderer, a rapist, you delegate.

Speaker 6:          00:57:39       Total complete piece of shit would not be that hard to turn your life around and get yourself to a point where you're. You're not shitty to people. That's right. That's not hard to imagine that people, even people that have been involved with petty crime or forgery or whatever the fuck it is, just if they just stopped doing all that and started treating all the people around them as if it was them living another life. That's not that hard to imagine. It's only hard to imagine if everyone's like clawing and scratching and trying to make it to where end, dealing with the effects of a shitty childhood, which is Goddamn almost everything for most people. It's the number one trip up mind fuck programming gone badly from the beginning and it's so hard to erase the hard drive, reformat the discs and do it correctly. So fucking hard. Dude.

Speaker 3:          00:58:32       This is why we have therapy, right? That's the like you can like their. This is why people go to therapy because those guys are really good at getting you to swim down into your childhood and find the place where you got the. You know, you generally you're going to get one of two teachings. You're going to a few different teachings from growing up, but one of the teachings a lot of people get is that there's not enough milk in the netball. They get some version of that which is like the food's going to run out. The loves getting run out. The, you know, this is not a safe environment. Your mom and I are working really hard, but we don't have enough money and we can't make ends meet and sometimes we're not gonna have enough and I can't afford to get you the stuff the other kids get and I'll tell you why because my boss, Mr. what was the name you gave that guy? Start what? My boss.

Speaker 7:          00:59:22       Mr Whitmore is a fucking asshole. Yeah. Whitmore sort of a bit. She's given me too many hours and he's not giving me a fucking raise and so life sucks. Do you understand it? Shut up and look at me. You Little Shit. Have you been smoking fucking weed? Do you not understand how dangerous this world is? A lot of people get that and they come out of their, their family life, like somebody you just got flown in from fucking Afghanistan. They have a kind of PTSD. They don't understand what, uh, they don't. They don't understand that the universe is ambivalent. It's not malicious. It's ambivalent. It's the best. It's ambivalent. And if it's low, if the universe is the universe has some agenda, will fuck. Let's just give up. There's no free will. But if the universe is just to kind of chamber within, which we can experiment with manifesting whatever our goals happen to be, then it's not that the universe is out to get you no matter where you're at.

Speaker 7:          01:00:17       In fact, your conceptualization of the universe is a thing out to get you is only reaffirming that awful version of the universe that got crystallized in your head a way back when and now you're always trying to be right. That's another thing. People in rough families, they're always trying to be right. They want to be fucking write about everything. You know, they want to assert their will be right in there and because there are a war because they feel like if they're not right, then they're vulnerable. So the next time, here's a fun fucking experiment. I know you already do this man, but I've been try playing around with it the next time someone does something wrong to you, really wrong. Like someone does something wrong to you. The thing that you're always fighting back against and always being right when you the next time you've been wronged for real, where you could easily say to the person, this is fucked up what you did to me and here's why.

Speaker 7:          01:01:13       Let them be right. Just play around with losing and not even though you know that you're right, play around not being right. Surrender. Watch what happens. Just love them, love them and be wrong. Let them think they're right. Love them. Let let them work through whatever it is they're working through. Watch what happens. It's the weirdest, weirdest thing, man, because it's like all of a sudden this into so many people are vengeance based. You know I'm going to get you. Fuck with me. I'm going to get you. I'm going to get you, motherfucker. I'm going to get you one. I'm going to get you. You did it. Oh, I got you. I got you. Good. Stopped taking revenge. The next time you get a chance. Be merciful even though the person deserves it. Just be merciful. It's a really fun experiment. It's really fun and you'll like the weight that gets lifted off of you in that moment.

Speaker 7:          01:01:59       I, I stopped drinking recently and I was drinking too much man. I was drinking like every night, a couple of beers and I was like, yeah, yeah. Did it creep up on you? Yeah. Creeped up and I realized know I started training with Justin and a quick things creep up on you though. Yeah, they creep up. You've had a couple of things creep up on you. Right? Well that's the alcohol like creeped and all of a sudden I was drinking every night and I was kinda getting used to the idea of waking up with a hangover and like it was bad. Uh, so I told me like, you can't have certain pills around or you'll just keep eating. That's my problem. That's, that's actually a problem. And it's a blessing because like if I get addicted to something healthy, I get really addicted to. The problem is it's easier to get addicted to things that aren't healthy for you.

Speaker 7:          01:02:47       So like, yeah man, I realized like, you know, I wasn't like Charles Zbikowski, I wasn't even drinking vodka. I was like, it was just a very subtle thing I was doing where every night I'd have two beers, maybe three beers, sometimes it wasn't like I was getting hammered, but every night I was putting alcohol into my bloodstream with great frequency. Right. And so, you know, I, I've been thinking a lot about the concept of the human life as being kind of out chemical experiment. Like your body is like a beaker and everything that you eat and everything that you witnessed and everything that you hear, whatever enters into your sensory input is like an additive that you're in. You're putting into this mix and the mix that you're creating is. It depends on what you want to create, but what you definitely don't want to create in that mix is sadness, horror, depression, anger, bitterness, loneliness.

Speaker 7:          01:03:43       For me, I'd like that mix to be health, happiness, amplification of my ability to love, forgiveness, all that kind of stuff. So from that Pov, I was noticing that when I was drinking my ability, my ego is flaring up a little bit. I found myself, uh, just kind of in a, in what if I continued that path, you know, if I kept drinking and drinking and drinking and drinking, I could just see where it would take me a and I didn't want to go there. So anyway, I stopped drinking and started doing this kind of like observation of the way I feel now that I'm not drinking. Right. And one thing I've noticed is that when I go out to a club or a bar where are, wherever there's alcohol and I don't drink about like 10:00 or 11:00, my body feels so good. Like all of a sudden my body is like, wait, why do we feel so good?

Speaker 7:          01:04:38       What the fuck is going on? Man? I feel this. I feel really good. And I think that like, why do I feel so good? It's like, oh, you don't have two beers in your fucking system. Your blood sugar's not thrown off. You don't have like this like flammable liquid coursing through your body. That's considered to be one of the most dangerous drugs that currently exists on the planet that we're on. And I feel awesome in the morning. Oh, you wake up, my God damn man. What a great night's sleep. Weird. You don't have a flammable fucking liquid in your stomach being. You know what I mean? Like, oh wow. Not to be disgusting, but shit man, my back, my fucking shit man has gotten healthier. And then you're like, oh, everything's better. Oh Wow. Weird. What a shocker. Huh? That fucking fermented wheat juice you've been dumping into your fucking mouth for the last year, five times a week was fucking up your body dumbed dum.

Speaker 7:          01:05:30       And so, so, so. So did we choose. That's really what it is. So, so, so, uh, so it's really cool because not only do you get to do that, but you get to watch what happens to the fibers of the fermented wheat juices that hours of the night tick on. And you watch these people, you know, gradually transformed from like really fun people into the Goddamn walking dead. Like you see this very slow, weird tumble and do some version of a, of ego, you know, so it's a really fun thing to do all these things as an experiment don't take. You don't have to get all heavy about it. She's like, I'm going to do an experiment. I'm going to watch what I'm like when I drink. I'm going to watch what I like when I don't drink. I'm going to pick which one I liked better.

Speaker 7:          01:06:15       And right now, not drinking Dunkin. I like a fuck load better than drinking. So much more fun. But to wrap this thing up, forgive my rant. What I noticed is if I get my, that I have an addiction to being right, that I have an addiction to getting revenge, that I have an addiction to making sure that like, uh, you know, I'm, I come out on top of whatever the fucking thing is. Not In an extreme way, but like, you know, if I feel like I've been wronged, I'm going to let you know. Man, I'm going to let you know. Right, so if instead of doing that, I stopped that game. I've stopped that game whenever I stopped that game. Wow. It's exactly like when I'm not drinking like where there normally is a fight where there's normally some bit of awkwardness or uncomfortableness or just a general diminishing a experience of the universe.

Speaker 7:          01:07:04       There's this. Oh Wow. I don't have to punish. You don't have to get you back. I don't have to get revenge. I don't have to say anything. I can just sit here and love you and this moment will pass and everything continues to be cool. The universe doesn't fall apart. My belly doesn't get ripped open by the clause of my enemy. I don't have to get revenge. I don't have to become like the beast of the field and tear everything apart. I can actually just love things and in general, loving them is going to do a hell of a lot more for transforming them into something a kinder than me telling them they suck.

Speaker 5:          01:07:41       I mean, there are definitely exceptions to this rule, but for the most part, most exchanges that people have with each other, our our exchanges is two people giving out two different personalities, exchanging expression. The way they talk to each other is dependent upon the way the other person reacts and it's the volatile combinations are oftentimes more than one person's fault. It's not. There's not a lot of people have to be on board with this for it to really work, but it's absolutely possible that it can work. The idea

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       that we're supposed to be constantly in conflict with each other. Like I can't tell you how many people that I know that are in relationships that accept yelling and throwing shit at each other. You know, can you imagine if you had a buddy and he just yelled at you all the time and threw shit at you. You'd be like, dude, what the fuck man, you gotTa stop yelling at me and throwing shit at me. Put your fist up. You're going to hit me like, I don't want to be around you. I don't do that to you. Like, this is crazy. It's this got to be some sort of a fundamental change in how people look at each other and until, until that happens, we're still going to get tricked by being from a certain, being proud of being from a certain city or being proud of being from a certain state and then in competition with the other states in competition with the other cities and the other countries, they could suck it because look at Toby Keith said, you know, run, you know all that nonsense.

Speaker 6:          01:09:08       It's all whole, all of it. This is just, it's just people, man, you know, like I'm not necessarily on a team with you. You know, we're all trapped in this one continent together and we should be cool with each other and we should, but we should be on team world. Is America the shit? Of course it is. It's a great place for anybody who says America is not an amazing spot for a lot of different shit is out of their mind. You have to be a hater. You have to be a hater to not look at the insane amount of accomplishments that have come out of this spot that have nothing to do with you or I have nothing to do with us. Just completely objectively. We didn't even exist. We were just a computer analyzing be human life on this planet. You would have to say the United States is to shit on because if you weren't, you'd be lying.

Speaker 6:          01:09:50       Okay. But the idea that somehow or another, the United States is important and that Africa is in, is important in Antarctica is, and, and this is important, but that isn't, and this is more important than that. And these people have our land. They're like, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Who is we? And they and our, you know, there's a human beings interacting with each other. What are you saying? They can't live here and you can't live there. And what fucking government owned what patch of dirt? And they get to instill Sharia law. What the fuck are you doing? God Damn that. The problem is the organization of all these different human beings under various groups, whether it's the group called the city of the group, call it state of the group called a country. That's where shit gets fucked and then you rely on the morals and the intellect of a handful of leaders to guide the entire fucking set of laws that govern this patch of land.

Speaker 6:          01:10:42       Millions and millions of people tend to either we let the terminator be the governor of California. That should be enough to and he didn't do a bad job. Not Bad at all to do a bad job. He did a lot better job than other folks, whether I'm not dissatisfied with a terminator. He was a good governor. The La River in particular, you did some good stuff. I mean he daddy's got assigned by the La River, so I guess that means you did something to it. The way he describes it, he says like the bureaucracy of government was just insanely complicated. Like there's no way to get through it. It's like the way they had. They would say,

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       look, that would be logical, but we can't do it that way, so if you bring this up, I'm going to oppose it because it benefits my constituents that I oppose it and then we'll debate and it'll just get pushed under the rug and go away and that's how we do it and they squash things that way and they. And so this is a handful of people that are, that are moving around all these core parts of our society and changing weird laws and instilling new regulations and charging taxes and figuring out all this weird shit. Yes, and this is a fucking. Are there hundred of them? A few hundred of them. It's crazy. The idea. A few hundred people could say it's a thousand a thousand people at the top of the heap in California. Can, you can make laws for the other $30 million they can. That's crazy. It's fucking nuts, man.

Speaker 4:          01:12:01       It's nuts that to imagine that that's how that human hive currently is functioning, is that we assigned various queens and kings, you know, he gave people, we assigned people out of power and, and, and worship. Those people and hilarious ways and like how cops fall into this horrible trap of being involved in constant conflict, back and forth, constant conflict, and they get used to this position of power and they get confused by this position of power and this position of being constantly in conflict and then they come into things charged. Somebody. Government people in government are probably a lot the same way. You get someone, you give them a position where they're in charge. Like Lyndon Johnson back in the sixties when he didn't have. You weren't really as responsible today for every single thing you say or do mean he could get away with a lot of shifting shit back then.

Speaker 4:          01:12:53       And that guy was a scary dude. Yeah man. That to go back to the beginning, part of that, the cop example, uh, and why cops act the way that they act. Somebody, you know, I was doing a real shrill hippie rant against cops and a man as really being self righteous. And I really got into full, like trussell shrill, raspy lesbian. This is an outrageous thing that airline did. And then somebody said this to me, he's like, Hey, I want you to imagine this man. You have your wife is you have a pregnant wife at home and some guy that has got bad tags or whose car matches an amber alert car, whose car matches the car? If somebody you killed some people a few weeks ago drives in front of you, and your job is to pull that person over. That person decides he doesn't want to pull over. So now you've got to chase this fucking person because if you don't chase this person, there's a possibility he's going to do something else in the world and you're going to have to deal with that guilt for the rest of your life because you didn't catch this guy could have been this person. See, he chased this fucking person. High speed, fucking chase down the interstate. You look down at

Speaker 7:          01:14:12       your cell phone for a second. It's your wife calling. She's pregnant. You have a pregnant fucking wife and you're driving a hundred and 15 miles per hour down the interstate to chase some fucking asshole. He's not pulling over who very potentially as a weapon and they're going to shoot you and your son or daughter is going to grow up without a daddy. So when you finally get that person or a group of your best friends, get that person pulled over, it's going to be safe to say that your adrenaline levels are going to be at African bull. Elephant level off the chart. Your pulses pounding and you're gonna. Get out of the fucking car and you're not going to think probably unless you're a zen master and you have full control over yourself. Like if you've ever gotten road ridge where you've screamed at someone just for cutting you off.

Speaker 7:          01:15:00       Think about the rage you would experience once you finally tackle somebody who just almost killed you and a bunch of innocent people trying to cross the street and a high speed pursuit. You are going to be angrier than you've ever been in your fucking life. And so I mean, to maintain that kind of like calm, placid professionalism that you're supposed to maintain when every part of your body is telling you to kill this threat and your life is not exactly the easiest thing ever. I'm not excusing cop violence. I'm just saying if you really look at it, you can empathize with why you as an individual, if you put yourself in that position, might not be able to stop your elbow from landing on. That person's back a little harder than it needed to because you're fucking pissed. Right? So somebody explained that to me.

Speaker 7:          01:15:54       It's like, oh shit, of course. Yeah, I do understand that. You're right. Still wrong. Still cops shouldn't beat fucking people up and a lot of times they do it. It's obviously associate bath. He's gotten the job of a cop, but a lot of times it's somebody who really got into the job because they were like, fuck man, I don't want to do good things in the world and they're not perfect. We got to lighten up a little bit. I got to lighten up a little bit. I got like, I think it's a job that almost no one's qualified to do. Right. I think that you could talk to a guy. I know a dude who got mugged once and he has ptsd, like it freaks them out of kids not married one time. We got mugged one time and you know he has what he calls post traumatic stress disorder.

Speaker 7:          01:16:33       It, it changed his life. Like you mentioned, we ain't a fucking cop and every single goddamn day you're dealing with a new guy who got shot in the face, a new woman who got run over by a truck, a new this, a new that, a new extreme violence, a new horrible accidents, all that shit. You're constantly dealing with this barrage of terror of terror and then you're not even getting paid that much. Right? You get, you get 50 grand a year, 60 grand a year at the most. I mean, how much does a starting cop in La make pretend? Let's pretend it's 100,000 dollars a year because it's not that you. Would you be willing to get $2,000

Speaker 6:          01:17:10       a week for people to shoot at you? He'd be like, how many more weeks can I collect this money coming for? How many more weeks? How many weeks can you collect that money right before you're dead, before you get shot in the head by some dude who hates cops has been in jail his whole life because his fucking parents were criminals. He was born into a criminal neighborhood, is constantly around crime and violence. He was abused from the time he first popped out of his mother's pussy and needs just doomed just on doom street and you just want to get home to your kids. Good luck. And that's every day. That's it. Yeah, that's real. It's fucking really starting. Pay is 57,000. Four hundred and 10. That's private for taxes. I don't know if they pay taxes. They pay taxes, right? Man, it's complete you. Of course I do that.

Speaker 6:          01:17:52       They can pay taxes. They do. Scientology does. Galleries there are called the cult of police, but no, but they. They pay, they pay taxes, but scientology doesn't. That's hilarious. That's hilarious. That's hilarious. As a religion, as an entity, obviously the police department as a state to get funded by the state because I feel like I'm not an anti cop person at all. Now. I know I have a lot of friends that are cops procop I 100 percent. Am I just as a human? I don't. I just don't think most humans are qualified to deal with the stress that comes with that job. There's a few men luke's out there that can fucking handle it. There's a few clinics. What's out there? The Big John McCarthy, the guy who the referee for the UFC, like I seen everything. He's seen everything. He'll tell you some crazy fucking stories.

Speaker 6:          01:18:36       Beach, cool shit. You can hang with him. He doesn't have any posttraumatic. Nothing. He's fine. He just deals with reality, mean deals. In reality, all it means a referee for Nma. The best ever in his spare time, you know? I mean that's what he does for, for a goof. Keep himself occupied. You know? I mean, that guy's seen fucking everything, but he's cool shit. I had breakfast with him the other day in Mexico. No idea that guy was that. That's what he did. Great God damn stories. That's my point being he can handle it, but he's an exceptional dude. You know? He's an exceptional. He's an exceptionally mentally strong person too. For a lot of people. Man, it's just too much. And then on top of that, you know, for a lot of people they're dealing with that and then their personal life is chaotic.

Speaker 6:          01:19:17       Maybe they married the wrong person, maybe their families, maybe they got a brother that's fucking crazy or they got. Who knows, who knows, who knows? There's so many variables that people have to deal with and the idea that you would give one civilian who's not a monk, you haven't reached some 10th level of enlightenment that you could show me that you can be completely without judgment and treat everyone with kindness and love. No, no. You're just a guy who just a regular guy and then you put in this position where you get a gun, you get a gun and you get a walkie talkie and you're in a. you're in a. it's like a gang. I mean, being a cop is like a bean in a positive gang and you're going out there and you're doing battle with all the negative gangs and there's a bunch of them and you know you've got to make relationships and sometimes you gotta put your foot down some pop.

Speaker 6:          01:20:04       Sometimes you get a drag. Someone's fucking ass to jail to teach you a goddamn lesson. Be throwing people in. Paddy wagons, you become in conflict professionally with a group of people who are just trying to scratch out survival through crime. The scariest people you could come in contact with ever, especially if you're some fucking white dude from Pomona with Chubby cheeks and you just can't figure out another way to make a living and then all of a sudden you're involved with really hard people that have grown up in hard neighborhoods and they will fucking sucker punch you and take your gun in a heartbeat and that's just. You're dealing with the wrong people. They've already accepted the fact they're going to go back to jail. Do you understand that? They've been there. They've been there. They went through juvenile hall. They might've gotten raped in Juvi, okay, these are wild people in a lot of situations you're dealing with when you're dealing, when you're on a crime call, like say if you're responding to some home invasion or you're responding to someone breaking into some building and looting and robin or something like that, who knows what kind of human beings are encountering, who knows what kind of history they have in the penal system, having been tortured and shoved into these cages and turn into worse, scarier criminals and then released after time served, good luck Johnson out there on the mean streets of Los Angeles, you know, and then you get out there and you got to stay in a halfway house.

Speaker 6:          01:21:20       Wherever the fuck you have to do and you don't have any job prospects and next thing you know you're involved again and you've accepted the fact that you're a fucking criminal. And the cops would come and they didn't hold me off the fucking jail and they start shooting. The moment they see you, they think about that time in the cage. You think about all the fucking kids that raped him in juvenile to think about every horrible thing that's ever happened to them and they unload with their gun on you gang gang, and you're a little trouble. Chubby Pomona face starts going Pale because you're bleeding out. Wow. Yeah. Your hands on somebody's squad car. Yeah. You eyeballs blown out the back of your head. You realize you have a hole in your head, but you're still seeing how your left eye and you watch your life slip away from you.

Speaker 6:          01:22:00       Why? Because you've got the wrong gig. Every. Everybody that's a cop has to think like that. Man. Those possibilities aren't just. It's not just. It could happen. It has. It absolutely does. There's so many cops get murdered on the job. So many. There's so many. There's so many videos of it. You know the idea that all these cops that have killed people or senior, really the problem, there's a whole big problem and the problem is the way human beings treat each other. The need for cops in the first place is the problem. Before the idea of cops being the problem. I mean, everybody wants to look at police violence for good reason. It's a very important subject right now for all of us, especially when it has connotations of when it's got connections to racism. It's got connections to sexual issues was also, you know, when you, when you see a man punch a woman in a situation where you probably don't think he would punch a guy, you know there's. There's a lot of weird shit that happens with police officers interacting with human beings. The idea that anybody is qualified to hold that position and have that kind of power just by being a regular guy. Good luck, good luck, good luck,

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       good luck trying to do that, but the problem is that it exists at all that we needed it all. The problem is that there are all these crimes. The problem is that we do beat each other up. You do have domestic violence issues where you show up and some guys beating his wife up. Those are real. You really are going to encounter that. Those are really the problems. The fact that we need police at all are the problem. It's these issues, these, these events, these, these, these patterns of human behavior that are horrible, where were horrible to each other. Those are the fucking problems. Everything from that is just the wrong solution to deal with that problem. One of the wrong solutions so that just about anybody be a cop and you give them a gun and you give them some training and you send them with their weak fucking character out there in the world because not everybody's big John Mccarthy. There's a lot of bitches out there. There's a lot of dudes that get to be a cop and there really are a bitch. Right? And that's a fact. And if you put that guy in a stressful situation where it's all going down, he's gonna probably fucking panic.

Speaker 7:          01:24:07       Like that pool party, that legendary pool. You saw that pool party, right? Where the cop, like there's some girl in a bikini, throws her to the ground. He does that barrel. He comes in with a barrel. It's so fucking hilarious. Like this is his dream. That is the problem. It's like not everybody's becoming cops for the exact same reason, but what you just did, all of that man is really important because it helps people empathize with most of them. And that's the ticket right there, man. We've got to learn how to empathize. They've got to learn how to empathize with us too, like they've got to understand that a lot of the people that they're attacking, they're attacking them for drug laws that shouldn't exist anyway. And so that's, that's uh, if we, if we get a lot of it, but there's a lot of other shit.

Speaker 7:          01:24:54       But if we could get that, if we can get rid of the drug, if we can get rid of the prohibition on drugs, however we do it, I don't care. But if we can get rid of the prohibition on drugs so that now cops are just, as Graham Hancock points out, there's already laws in place for people doing awful things under the influence of drugs or not under the influence of drugs. We just need to enforce those. Not the drug laws themselves. Right? So if, if we remove that from the equation. So these poor cops aren't being told to go out into the world and instead of being heroes, you've also got a pole, relatively benign white powder out of the pockets of people who have $15 in the bank and only one experience, a temporary moment of bliss before they pass out. If you remove that component of their job and just like stop people from beating and killing each other and from stealing. Don't worry about the drugs that now we've got heroes. Now we've got night's riding through the land who are actually doing everything they can to make people be cool instead of nights riding through the land. We want to pull plant matter

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       out of a 16 year olds pocket and act like the kid just assassinated Kennedy. That's not what we need. And I think that's the. Once you. Once you fucking fix the prohibition on drugs, man, then I think police officers are going to experience the same kind of respect that firemen get. That's how it should be. And one step further, once they legalized marijuana, everyone's going to start smoking pot and you're going to get a lot more relaxed. People, yes, you're going to get people that are a lot more introspective. Oh, what are you saying? This is what I'm saying. If you don't believe that a lot more people smoking pot would have a significant impact on the way human beings interact with each other. All that means to me is you don't smoke pot, right? Because if you smoke pot, you would know that that's exactly what would happen.

Speaker 6:          01:26:48       People would become more empathetic. Not across the board. Not always. There's. There's always gonna be people that are. The exception to the rule is always going to be people that just don't get it yet. There's always going to be people that get it and they don't need. They don't need anything. They just tuned in and they're kind and they're on point and they're living in the moment and all that good shit, but then there's other people that benefit from those things and you deny those people the opportunity to benefit from those things and then you become the enemy. You become the Fuzz, you become the man and then you're a fucking glorified revenue collector too. What are you really doing? You're going to get, I'm going to get a fine. I got to go to court and pay the court. Fine. What am I paying?

Speaker 6:          01:27:23       I'm giving you money. You need thousands of dollars because I like plants. How about fuck you? What kind of crazy shit is this? You can lock me in a cage and charge me money because I like plants or you're the arbiter of nature. You're the one who gets to decide what's beneficial and what's not with zero evidence behind it whatsoever, which was one. It's one of the most heinous crimes on nature. The illegalization of marijuana is one of the most heinous crimes on nature that mankind has ever, ever put forth. And we're doing it to ourselves. It's even worse than most of the shit that we do to other planets or to other, uh, other animals by torturing them or by killing them or by poisoning the lakes and the rivers. And W, we're pleasing the consciousness of ourselves by not allowing people to have freedom to experiment with all sorts of different states of consciousness.

Speaker 6:          01:28:18       You have illegal way to do it through yoga. You have a legal way to do it through prescription medication. You have a legal way to do it through alcohol and things that we tax, but if you decide that you want to try to do it in a way that we haven't sanctioned and we don't get paid for, we don't get taxes from, we'll lock you in a fucking cage for the rest of your life. That's right. For the. The differences as far as impact, like the physical danger significantly less than any of the ones that you have league. Oh yeah. I get is the one that you can't die from. You can die from aspirin. There's not a single fucking person that wants you to ban aspirin. There's no band aspirin movement. There's no like we've got to take these aspirin or you just eat a of aspirin. You're fucked.

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       Ban. You're dead. Right. If you. If you have one of those bare fucking aspirins was bigger, I'd guarantee if you chug that whole bottle down, you'd or pure caffeine. Don't forget that a kids die all the time from ordering pure caffeine from Amazon. I don't know if they still sell it, but they used to sell pure caffeine. You hear it all the time, kid like party takes a teaspoonful of pure caffeine and that's it, man. Dead dead meat. You know, your heart just flies right out of your fucking chest. Like a bird. Yeah, that's right man. And how about just water? I mean there was that woman on a radio station in Sacramento or something a year, a few years back. She was involved in some sort of contest to see who could drink the most water. And if you drank the most water, you know, you got a prize hair member.

Speaker 4:          01:29:45       She fucking died. That's terrible. She went home to her. I mean she, she was, she was on her way home or something like that. She had a, she had a daughter. She was just trying to make some extra money. Yeah. When she died drinking water. And it's insane. It's insane. But that wouldn't happen to you if you smoke too much pot. That's right. Wouldn't happen to know if he ate too much pot. Right. So the idea that they're locking anybody up for that is fucking ridiculous. If you put cops in a position where they have to enforce a law that they know, everybody knows is ridiculous, then that cop is in a bad position in society. He becomes the enemy from the jump, the enemy that he can't even agree with. Most cops you talked to most cops, they don't give a fuck about pot.

Speaker 4:          01:30:27       They don't want to have to enforce that. Most guys in their thirties, you'd have to be a total complete piece of shit. Yeah. As a human being to be a cop and your thirties and really want to arrest a regular person that's not doing anything wrong. Who happens to have a joint on them? You got to be a piece of shit. If this guy didn't do anything wrong and he has a joint on them and you want to arrest him, you're a cunt. Yet of beyond all the scripture. Adult. Yeah. I mean that's. That's a problem because that is the law in most states. That is the law, like they're supposed to arrest you for that most states most, yeah. Which is insane. We, here we are, we, we were sending videos with the sky phone to phone. We're, we're periscoping and livestreaming and driving around in cars that have satellites connected to them.

Speaker 4:          01:31:15       They tell you exactly what street you're on and how when the turns coming up, they give you a ding Dong to tell you to turn exactly where you are. And yet we still have that. Yeah. But it's changing. It is changing and it's, it just doesn't happen as fast as, as stones would like it to change. Like it seems so obvious. You want the thing to flip around instantly. It's almost like they can't do that because then they would have to admit fault or it's it. It's almost like there's just a terrible bureaucratic web that uh, it takes time to make things change. When you're using that bureaucratic web. That's the fucking problem, man. And things are slow but shit there, it's happening. It is happening. It's going to become legal. We can't stop there.

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       We've got to get psilocybin a prescribed, at the very least. MTMA needs to be a prescription medication. All psychoactive substances like Iowasca DMT. All of these things need to be studied, they need to be researched and then they need to get into the hands of doctors who could really use them to help people. It could be an incredible tool for helping people who are suffering right now and the whole thing's all gummed up and that is a true tragedy. It doesn't stop with marijuana though. It goes all the way through the spectrum of drugs and it also goes to the very creepy, unacknowledged a problem with the pharmaceutical companies which are releasing heroin on a daily basis into the bloodstream of this species and they're not being treated like heroin dealers. A lot of people are getting addicted to super powerful pharmaceutical medications and I don't think the pharmaceutical companies are being held to any kind of tea to anything. It's just for whatever reason, if I. If your friend gets addicted to oxy cotton because his back was thrown out and you hear that story, you're supposed to feel a little bit more empathy towards them. Then if you hear somebody, you got addicted to black tar heroin when it's like, no, it's the same fucking thing.

Speaker 6:          01:33:24       Thing like wasn't that part of the argument with the Silk Road trial was that this young man who had run that website that allowed people to buy all sorts of illegal drugs, he had been directly responsible for people overdosing. He'd been directly responsible for people that may have committed some crimes and done some shitty things were on those drugs and you know, he had to face the parents of people who bought drugs and overdosed in some form. I don't know the specifics of the case, but that was part of what they were charging them for. Well, how come that never gets brought up with pharmaceutical companies? Because I mean think about all the different people you're not, so you're not responsible for your own actions as long as the drugs illegal. Right? But you are responsible for your own actions if the drugs legal and prescribed by a doctor, but maybe even more addictive. Like, wait a minute, what the fuck? Kinda stupid rules are we abiding by here? Take Heath Ledger. Take him, if he take you to that, check them in your eyes. Take him, take him. Take Heath Ledger and imagine if heath ledger had oded on heroin. Remember when God, what? Phoenix. Phoenix. Now River Phoenix, the great actor. He sell coal blind. Seymour Hoffman, right? Right.

Speaker 3:          01:34:32       One of the news stories is how they're trying to find his dealer. Right? They're like, we're going to hunt down the guy who sold in this fucking shitty smack, but when he fletcher, Oh, d's on these fucking pills. You don't hear anybody being like, we're going to find the pharmacists that gave heath ledger this combination of fucking pills and we're going to take this son of a bitch down. It's just like, wow. It was pills. So it's heath ledger's thought that's not the pharmacist, but. So does. Very good point. Yeah. It's just very, very good to take you. It's like, let's acknowledge the fact that if you are dealing drugs, you're a drug dealer and whatever the drug is that you're dealing, uh, whether it's sanctioned by the state or not sanctioned by the state, whatever that drug is, that you're, uh, dealing, uh, it is the decision of the person who buys it from you to take it.

Speaker 3:          01:35:19       It is their own freewill. It is human autonomy. If you decide to take a substance that is your right as a human, no matter what the fuck it is from God damn heroin to marijuana, to alcohol, your right as a human being on this planet is to, as much as you want, alter or transform your particular chemical states or psychological states or mood states even if it ends up killing you, but your but, but under the effects of those things, you're not allowed to hurt other people. You're not allowed to do fucked up shit. And if you do, those are the laws and the crimes that you should be. How the candidates,

Speaker 5:          01:35:56       oh, for Hunter Thompson had a set of rules that he was trying to establish when he was running for mayor of Aspen in the 19 seventies and one of the things was he was going to have stock hades. He was gonna. He was gonna sign up to all the streets, like chew up all the concrete, saw the streets, and he was going to have stock that he would put drug dealers so that he said that any drug worth taking you should never buy or sell of rule four rule is what we going to. What he was going to do was he was gonna. Well obviously it wasn't really going to do that. I mean it was pros, but he was saying that he was going to have stock hades in front of the statehouse where he would, or front of the building, whatever it would be. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:36:41       He's great man. Great. What is his. He's got another quote. I just read what I just, I love. Which is like, you don't find lsd. LSD finds you when you're ready. It's true. It's pretty cool,

Speaker 5:          01:36:52       man. I don't believe that. I believe that with all psychedelics. I really do. It sounds so stupid when you say it. Like you believe it, bro. You believe it was a plan for everything. It doesn't matter if I believe or don't believe because I really would never know if it's true, but it's fun to believe it, so therefore I believe it. I don't really think that the Hulk Bruce Banner becomes the hulk and leaps through the air and smashes the airplanes, but it's fun. It's fun to watch it and while it's happening I try to pretend like it's really happened, man.

Speaker 3:          01:37:20       Damn right. That's a problematic. You know, I think a lot of skeptics and cynics does sound on fun. They don't understand that it's that like they were. I believe that I can choose whatever lens I want to use to look through the universe.

Speaker 5:          01:37:34       They're super important to men because they dispelled bullshit and then the comforter, the comfort that you have in balancing on the ledge of truth and fantasy and fun, and some people do not have that comfort on that ledge and for them, skeptics are hugely important because they can disprove a lot of the shit that other folks can't see. Everybody has different vision when it comes to their ability to perceive things and some are born shortsighted,

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       but we're supposed to pretend that the brain is 100 percent equal across the board and everyone can see all the bullshit that everyone else can see. Well, that's not always the case. There's some people that just don't have good sight and they don't have good clarity there. They just don't and they need help. Well, yeah, they do. You're right, but those people aren't gonna. Listen to a fucking skeptic. I mean data. If they need a little, some of them will. There's, there's a spectrum of them, but, but I do think you are as a skeptic in the same way, like I will fully admit that many fantasies that I have many ideas that I have a completely unprovable and more than likely horse shit, but they're so fun. They're so fun. But here's another thing that's important to acknowledge is that some of the lenses that you look through the universe through, even if the symbols that are within those lenses are completely ridiculous, like the symbol of Jesus rising from the dead, for example, or the symbol of a ganache or the symbol of Honamin.

Speaker 1:          01:38:59       Uh, even though the symbols themselves are clearly a fantasy, the effect of gazing through those lenses and the effect that it has on the decisions that you make quite often can be really profound. Which is that instead of making selfish, stupid, angry decisions, you might start making more positive decisions because you've connected with this architect, archetypical God of friendship and devotion, which is who Honamin as you know, Hanuman's. This monkey God that represents like pure devotion or service and friendship at the deepest, sweetest level to. And it's beautiful, it's beautiful, and so I can use that symbol if I want to, uh, when I'm thinking about loyalty or when I'm thinking about like giving up my life for another person's life. When I think about like giving myself to another person with nothing really to gain other than giving myself to that person and helping them as I can.

Speaker 1:          01:39:58       It's a great symbol. It works. Doesn't have to be fucking real. Do I believe in a monkey? God that flies through the sky? Do I believe in that? Do you think that symbols would, they can be, is almost like dedicated, dedicated thoughts that you can cling onto if you're trying to explain this, if you're moving through a sea of being a person, all the variables, all the negatives and positives and the, the, the, the, the changing of the tide, of your emotions and your happiness and your discontent and your depression will. But you could have these islands that in this float you could cling to and one of them might be the Buddha. Yes. And when you see the Buddha, you think of enlightenment. You think of yourself at peace and they can somehow or another imbibe you imbibe view with this, this, this cap encapsulization of like you're like, you're at least your imaginary

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       idea of what it's like to be enlightened. Damn right, you clean, you clean to that and that I can maybe guide you a little. You could hold onto that and it'll carry you down and maybe from there you can get to dry land. Maybe from there you can get to the island of new ideas, but these, these archetypal things that you claim to these, these images, whatever they may be, the reason why they've existed throughout history as that people have found value in their memories and connecting thoughts and principles and ideas to these symbols and that's why they defend them so hard. That's why people want to kill you. If you draw Muhammad, if you fuck up their idea of their symbol, their symbol is so significant to them that they're willing to. If they're willing to lash out and caused murder because you violated their.

Speaker 3:          01:41:36       They got stuck on the assemble and that's the. That's a problem. It's like somebody going through the wilderness thinking that the campus is the destination and it's, you know, that's. I don't know how anyone would be that dumb to think that and so that's a wrong way to put it, but it's a really. It's a in the same way literally like people who are always fighting over the literal g or the historic Jesus, you know, the people are like, that guy didn't even fucking exist, and that people that get really caught up and disproving Jesus, they've also gotten caught up in the surface level of that symbol and so they're spending all their time trying to prove no, no, no. There's never was a historic Jesus or the historic Jesus that existed was not the Jesus in the Bible that has blah, whatever you want to say.

Speaker 3:          01:42:18       You're damn right you, I, I'll buy a shirt. There was no real Jesus or there was. He was one of many people or who knows, or maybe he wasn't magical or whatever on one level, fuck yes, you're 100 percent right. There's also no Santa Claus. There's no such thing as ghosts. There's no such thing as reincarnation, we're all just a non-differentiated aspect of a great mass of Adam's currently being exploded out of an event 13 point 8 billion years ago, and that's it. Nothing else. That's fucking it. That's one level and it's totally real. There's another level though. That's the problem. There is a completely other level which is that the level of the interior self, the level of the subjective, the universe did a big bang. It exploded from the. It did a big bang. It exploded. I did a big duty like God is a baby, just accidentally shit Outta universe, but it explodes out and then it ends up turning into human beings and human beings end up somehow developing this incredibly advanced for frontal lobe and the neo cortex. Whenever you can throw out that word, throw it out, it makes you seem smart. Couldn't have a neocortex walked out to me. I wouldn't know what it looked like, but. But when that happened, we. We gained an interior universe, which is the universe of symbols, myth, dreams, stories, and that's a real part of the material universe. The material universe has a substrata, which is the universe of myth and the universe of religion and the universe of fantasy,

Speaker 7:          01:43:52       and that's another level of the fucking thing, and if you start tuning into those symbols, it doesn't matter if you're tuning into an externalized, mystical, super entity or whether you're tuning into a part of your brain that it comes from millions of years of evolution. You're still tuning into a point where from a harmonizing with it, you can experience an elevated mood state and that elevated mood, state and whatever way it manifests from the, uh, experience of Samadhi to the experience of the passion of the Christ, the surrender to allowing yourself to be destroyed by time and still loving it.

Speaker 6:          01:44:33       Or a yoga class or a comedy club or being the see a concert. Yeah, be you see a concert and you seeing someone perform music or someone was really good that you really appreciate their art. It moves you, you're holding, your body feels different, your emotions get torn up. You're like, wow. Like people will cry when they hear a great song though. There'll be moved like the like, fuck yeah, they'll throw their hands in the air to get nutty. The body will start moving, the Kinnaman help it or a mantra or a mantra or a mantra or or or any number of things that you can lock into with or sounds or images or some thing that we have encapsulated that causes us to react in this incredible way that we can replicate shot through the shoe, gave him a bad name and everybody just goes fucking crazy whether or not you agree with Bon Jovi or not.

Speaker 6:          01:45:27       That moment where 15,000 freaks go crazy. Yeah, because he sinks, shot through the heart and you're to blame and they just lose their shit. They can't help but they're stomping. They're hugging each other like, oh my God, they're high fiving each other. It's the best. Like it's undeniable that that gave those 15,000 people, you know, step out of the role of being an art critic for a moment and look at what happened to those 15,000 people. It's like, that's how I have to do with the grateful dead. I've, I've always had to step outside of the role of a music critic and just appreciate the. Some people love the fuck out of them. Like, okay, I'm missing a gene or something. No, you've never taken acid and listening to the grateful dead. You gotta do man, take some acid and listening to the grateful dead with me. You'll understand dude. I smoked DMT and listened to eco rose with Aubrey. Wow. And that. I don't know if the grateful dead and acid is going to be able to fuck with eco rose and the DMT experience. You have to do that. By the way. I would like to try. That is very different. The ECO rose thing is very different. This is what

Speaker 7:          01:46:32       mechanic was saying that these Shamans, they sing for things into form. They did. You see like a visual representation.

Speaker 6:          01:46:40       It's perfectly sinked. They're one in the same. There are two different things that go together and buy their own on their own. They're are magical. I mean on own. Did the ECO

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       sound fucking amazing? I listened to them on my way home from gigs when I want to see what I want to think about things, but I also want to hear something because I don't know what the fuck they're saying so because I don't know what they're saying. I can enjoy it without being attached to the words. They're just a bunch of noises. To me, the cool noises and I know guys and only because I know that word Iowasca I have. I've got a guy. It's really we. It sounds like a little kid singing kind. It doesn't act like a little kid and the forest would just be singing that song. There's a lot of them that are like that. Yeah. There's a lot of them that are really interesting. What is that? Is that blowing the smoke?

Speaker 8:          01:47:26       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:47:30       I listen to this one. I whistle this one. I find myself like whistling it through the day and the other day

Speaker 9:          01:47:39       I was whistling at the comedy store and one of the dudes who works there started whistling on. It was weird. He knew it. Nope. Nope. What? I was doing it so much. I was doing it so much, it sort of snuck into them, so the idea behind it, according to the Shaman is that the plants give them their salt and that as they're cooking up, the IOWASCA did learn the song and they figured out through this relationship, this pure relationship that they have to the madre because they're a real sharp and over the, you know, thousands of years of them doing this. They found some songs and when you, when you experienced dmt under the spell of the songs is a very, very strange experience because they, they belong together. It's like when you're hearing this, every time it changes and there's a whistle, a new chapter, we'll start a new geometric pattern will explode into something completely different and dance around you

Speaker 4:          01:48:42       and there's like a whole series that you listened to when you're on a trip, you start off with one sort of an introductory one and you move into the other one. And as it goes deeper and deeper and deeper that the experience changes and becomes this like really crazy complex geometrical life form that's all encompassing. It's everything that's all around you. That's beautiful. It's very strange, dude. That gets in the background.

Speaker 9:          01:49:10       That's legit as fuck, man. This is all recorded during a ceremony, so this is not just happening like with the guy singing happening, there's a guy singing with a group of people tripping the fucking balls off and he's guiding them and while this is going on, like it dances all around you and sues you and Tom to you and explained to you, do you know what even trippier about this

Speaker 4:          01:49:41       is that that night when you ever was lived near this shrimping, they're fucking brains.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       I bet somebody thought, man, why do I feel like this is gonna get transmitted to 10 million people? How weird is that? How weird is it that that's a very strange thing. That's what technology does because here you consider this incredible night. God knows where that was probably where. Where do you think that was recorded? Who the fuck knows? Somewhere I'll have an experiment that I want to do what? I'm going to have crash rig my tank up with speakers. I want to listen to that in the tank because I think if I listened to that in a tank enough, I think if I put that on loop for like an hour, I think I could trip my balls off. I think I'm going to try that experiment to. Yeah. Well you have a tank. No, you fucking fucking tag now. I got his intent now. It's so cool.

Speaker 1:          01:50:31       I'm A. I'm a zen 10. Explained to me the situation. It's in a bedroom. Well, yeah. What it is is because you know, like a Cemati tanker, any of the crashes, tanks, they're fucking crazy giant things and take a while to sell. They're expensive. Right? So yeah, this is just like a essentially like a reversed waterbed I guess you'd say. It's like it's a, it's a, it's a tent. A that how many gallons of water. I don't know the exact gallons, but it's big enough to float and fine. Like because I floated out in Austin at the Float Institute and the upload is amazing. Amazing. The presses right up there with crashes place and if you done crashes place. I haven't done that yet. Crashes the grandmaster, but this guy who's got the tank place in Austin. Yeah, Kevin, what's it called? Float Float Institute Institute. He's got his things are built like boats, like the hub of a boat trailer.

Speaker 1:          01:51:25       Yeah. Those things are super durable. They don't even know liner there. They're fucking cool man are super high tech. Super High Tech. But the, you know, the essence of the thing is you've got a shit ton of salt and water and you only need a certain amount of room, you know, based on like the average size of a human being. Plenty of room in the damn things. But yeah, I just uh, like I didn't realize how much I would enjoy having a float tank in my house. Like it. I had no idea that it would be that important to me. I've only had it for a few days and weeks lived with me. You use it all the time and I forget exactly. But. And it was awesome to have access, but I was so brokenhearted and crazy back then. Like now it's just like, you know, I've been working out, I'll go workout at the gym, come back to the house with sore muscles and then you're just, regardless of all the mystical shit, you're floating in 650 pounds of epsom salt with sore muscles and that feels damn good.

Speaker 1:          01:52:28       No, it feels like you're charging batteries. It's really amazing. And you walk out of the thing every time so far, and I've done 30 minute floats up to like an hour and a half so far. Every time you get out of the thing, it's exactly like the next day after a great mushroom trip where colors are brighter, you just rested. It's super cool, man. I'm super. I can't. I'm so and I haven't even gotten to the point of like, all right, what happens if I take a microdose of some psychoactive in this thing? I haven't even gotten there yet. You do that though,

Speaker 6:          01:53:01       right? Way To respond to that question. My favorite is eating pot. If I, if I ever ate too much pot and I was sitting around the house, I jumped in and right immediately. I don't want to waste it.

Speaker 1:          01:53:10       Yeah, man. That's what I mean. I guess that's a. of course I've been eating pot and going into. Of course I'm always eating pot. Said the other day on stage, but when you brought me up on stage and the night of the ice house, I was like, Duncan is the only guy that will tell me, man, I got. I fucking did acid. I'm not. I mean I did. Emma will do mtms. I did ecstasy. I'm not doing that anymore, man. I'm fucking. I haven't did anything for awhile. She's eating weed everyday. That's it. Like basically fucking almost sober. I consider that. I know this is. This is gonna seem like denial. I'm sorry. For those addicts out there. Maybe I'm in denial, but to me it does feel like coffee. Like I place it in the same place. I put coffee so it's not really to me like it does. It's like something that I, I don't find to be destructive to my life at all. I think alcohol was the monster and marijuana seems to just be a kind of,

Speaker 6:          01:54:04       well I'll do it one better. I worshiped coffee, right. Worship bit. Coffee is a ritual. I have a ritual when I write and I have a ritual when I do podcasts and one of my. One of the big parts of my ritual is coffee, not like a monster energy drink. I mean, I don't have anything wrong. I don't. Not like red bowls. They're fine. If you just need a pick me up. I'll drink wine. If I'm at the store and I know I'm tired and I have to drive home, I'll take a red bull, but a coffee is like a ritual. I adore coffee. I really do like, I love to get like a nice warm cup of coffee and then I started writing and I do what I do. A podcast like for me, the podcast doesn't seem like it starts until I'd take a sip of coffee.

Speaker 6:          01:54:45       Right. So I love it. I love coffee. I like the feeling, what it gives to me. I liked the way it tastes. I feel the same way about pond. I love it. It's. I don't, I don't. Not only do I not think, I absolutely don't think it's detrimental. I adore it and I think it helps my life. I adore it. I don't have any negatives. I've figured me and pot of a fucking super good relationship and sometimes it leaves me tired and I can't remember exactly what I just said, but it provides me with so much inspiration and introspective thinking that the, the, the counter, like the payoff is huge

Speaker 1:          01:55:20       man. Huge. You add to that having a fucking hole in the universe, in your goddamn house. Get out of town, man. You know what I'm saying? I've been saying it forever. Don't know. What have I been telling you for years? You have to take God dammit. Donkey. Yeah. You would say that to me. Like when I was like, you would say it to me when I car's about to get repossessed. Like, oh, just get a flow. Okay. I

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       told you anytime you wanted to get, use mine, you know that know you well yeah, of course you have the keys to my house. You can come over 3:00 in the morning and he's my tank anytime you don't wake my kids up fucking Weirdo. How weird would that would be a Weirdo come daddy. The weirdos here again, the climate here, uncle, Uncle Duncan, but man that. Yeah, it's a. it's a beautiful town. Beautiful happens and I think they should have community centers that have a man. I mean, so there's a lot of people that have apartments and in their apartment they have [inaudible]. They have a stationary bike or a treadmill. They have a little small gym with a television set in there. You want to have a nice apartment, an apartment. The fucking float tank can use. You have someone who maintains it. People sign up for it.

Speaker 5:          01:56:22       Don't let just anybody use it. Make sure that the guy who runs into creepers, I'm going to peek in on chicks whether in there naked, put a lock on the door, make sure you know these people are going to shit in it. There's no way around it. He'll. You'll know who did it. They have to sign up, right the fuck that guy will the victim that's you get evicted from the apartment complex to fight on top of the apartment conflict area manager. So went shit in that water. It doesn't matter how many times they filter it, you're not getting all this shit out. You have to take all the water out and clean the whole thing that water. The next time you climb in and there's going to be something in there that bites yet, what do you think the number is worldwide of people that have taken big shifts in isolation tanks? Thousand Dollars.

Speaker 5:          01:57:02       Imagine if there was a compilation video of every person who has ever taken a shit inside the isolation tank and you can just watch it happen in real time. People are awful. You would. You'd be insisting that people are awful and I think that's one of the real problems with judging the human beings as a, as a race. So there's too many of us. So if there's 7 billion people it, while we're saying this, 50 dudes are shitting and tanks right now, for sure, right? This tanks aren't even that common. There's not that many tanks in the world, but if people don't like the best over the course of this podcast, I'll say over the course of this podcast, and that's a conservative estimate taking how many fucking idiots there are. That just shit their pants. How many people are there? They're so stupid. They just shit their pants all the time necessarily a measurement of Iq.

Speaker 5:          01:57:50       They shit their bed. They, you know, when I was in, when I was in, I had to, I had a girlfriend. I've told this story before, but it's very unfortunate. And her roommate, um, used to have anal sex with her boyfriend and she wrote a letter about it that the reason why he does it, he's a little dick and it doesn't feel good unless he puts it in her ass and like it's very sobering for this poor gentleman and found this letter or her, her diary or whatever, but shit, the bed when they, they had, they had anal sex and apparently it relaxed her sphincter to the point where she just relaxed in bed while sleeping and just shat in the bed. And Yeah. And like the dude was just standing in the hallway like a random, like I came out of my girlfriend's bedroom and he was there in the hall of his hands out. Like after she had just shit on him. He was like, what the fuck? I never forget this poor, poor

Speaker 6:          01:58:43       what the fuck someone just shit on him because he was having anal sex with this girl he released. So what I'm saying is that poor gal, with whatever damage he did to her butthole, she could probably shit the bed if she went to an isolation tank, you know, she wasn't paying attention. She got a little too relaxed and fell asleep in there. You can get your bed, you can shit an isolation tank area can and people shit the bed. They just do. They just do. Yeah, I mean they do. There's no way around it. I, I get, I guess I think of like if you were in there and like you had just blasted some academy and into your bloodstream or south thing and you were just really gone and maybe your body will just evacuate it's bowels because it wanted to, you know, your astral body is, who knows where you're on Venus, you're not even in the float tank.

Speaker 6:          01:59:29       You're, you're just a monkey in there now. Yeah, I would imagine that's definitely, probably happened to somebody that took some drug. Did you, um, have you talked to Neal Brennan at all? Do you know Neil? I know Neil, but I haven't talked to him. Wait, I've got to take a leak. Please go ahead. Go ahead and do it. And when you come back, I'll return to you, its customer with your priestly priestly outfit. When you return, I'll tell you about neal Brennan taking ketamine for therapy. Did you know about that? Come, come back young Jesus. What are you a bishop or some shit? He's a bishop. Duncan trussell. Uh, Bishop, uh, if you, uh, have never listened at Duncan trussell's podcasts and you're tuning into this, maybe this is the first podcast here, we listened to the Duncan trussell family hour is for real, like probably one of the best podcasts in the known universe and Duncan is a, an oddly articulate and very bizarre character that I don't know anybody like him, you know, and he has a very interesting and unique way of looking at shit.

Speaker 6:          02:00:25       And one of the reason why I like doing podcasts with them because I feel like that when Duncan and I get together, we both pull some weird part out of each other. That's what I felt like when we were doing that stupid Scifi show when we were talking to people about bigfoot and shit. But that's how I feel when I do any podcasts with him. He's just a very, very unusual dude. And His standup is fucking hilarious and he will be with me at the comedy store this Friday night. We're doing the belly room at 10:00. I don't even think the tickets are available yet, but this Friday night at the belly room at 10:00, it would just be me and Duncan. That's it. And it's only like 70 tickets so it sells out very quick. So, uh, if you're interested in, I'm doing Saturday night at the same time to, at 10:00. So that's it. Fuckers, Duncan trussell family hour is on itunes. He doesn't have any standup that you can buy unfortunately. And that's something I've been hounding Dunkin for the longest. Fucking timely enters his little girl bladder. It's one thing I've learned about myself, young Jamie from doing this podcast and I have a manly bladder. I can drink four cups of coffee and sit here for three fucking hours and not bitch out and make them mad. Run for the bathroom most days, most days.

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       But I've had some, I've had some bad days, I've had some days where I couldn't keep it together. Sister, part of being a person. So if you can please give Duncan the hardest time possible about putting together a goddamn comedy specials so you all can enjoy his standup,

Speaker 1:          02:01:53       his brother. Praise, praise, praise zoo. Save tour, man. Big Tour. It's happening. I can't talk about it. My amazing agent, Joe Schwartz, the secret. They're going to be good though. It's happening. It is happening.

Speaker 5:          02:02:12       Do. When were you doing some gigs together again? We haven't done gigs, but we're doing Friday night at the comedy store, but we got to do some good gigs. I now go away from Los Angeles. Tuck. Yeah friend. Let's do travel. Yeah, let's travel. Love to. We need to do something where we do we do a series of dates on the road. You and I. This is what I'm thinking. Go to these different towns and then go do cool shit in the town and film it. Like, let's go to an Ashram. Let's, uh, let's take a yoga class together. Let's do a bunch of shit. Is Weird Shit. Specific to the task. Let's float tank and every time. Yeah, let's go to the Kentucky Derby. I want to do the Kentucky Derby next year and do a standup show in town. I want to know what the fuck that's all about. Horse racing was not even about the race, so at everybody getting fucked up.

Speaker 5:          02:02:55       That's what it's about, right? My Buddy Cameron hanes went this year and you're like, Jesus Christ. He's like, it's just people just getting drunk like everywhere you go. Everyone is just plowed by a hunter. Thompson. One of his early pieces of work that got him notoriety was he did a bit on the Kentucky Derby. The Kentucky Derby is decadent and deprived and his store in the Kentucky Derby. It's fascinating because it starts out just just describing the heinous people around them and then realizing you're one of those people. At the end he realized he's one of the monsters that he's been describing. That's awesome, but it's just one of those things. It's been going on forever and it's like connected to this ancient culture of riverboat gamblers. You know? I mean, that's what the Kentucky Derby is like. The ultimate gambler experience. Drunken excess. It's like mint Juleps. It's that. It's getting hammered and it's horse races, but it's like this, it's like a social event where people go and have a great time and apparently the vibe there is incredible. Like it's like really fun, like chaotic and people do just get fucking shit faced shit faced and I think if we went and got shit faced with these people.

Speaker 1:          02:04:11       Yeah. That can be super fun man. I mean there's places to go get shit faced out. Right? Right, right. But I want to experience the Kentucky Derby. The Kentucky Derby is something that I've heard of. I don't know enough about. Even like, yeah, sure. Like why don't we do that man. We could just go to burning man. Isn't that large? A bunch of horses gallop around alcoholics. When you go to the middle of the desert where there's shooting laser beams into space and giant squid tanks are rolling by shooting fire or we could do both. That's impossible. That's not the. That's on different dates now. I know I'm joking. Can do both. Yeah. That's what we should've done for. So to you and me looking for a nonexistent unknown primate wandering through the woods of the Pacific northwest, we should have gone to raves. We should have found real freaks.

Speaker 1:          02:05:02       I don't understand why, you know, I don't understand. Yeah, you're right. There's so many other ways to like analyze the universe. Like we're as far as science goes or somebody who's going to do a scientific investigation if things were pretty far away from the ideal scientist and we weren't really doing science and we're looking for bigfoot bullshit detecting where you really are doing now. But I, you know what I mean man. I think that it's like what, what ends up happening? Because TV shows have got to like having to wrap everything up. You got to have a point. You got to have a thing. You can't do what a podcast dies, which is just whatever you want. And I can't they do that. I don't know. I don't know. I guess I don't know. I mean why can't they have like a late night show that, why don't they have a late night show look after and I chose over.

Speaker 1:          02:05:48       That just goes on for like three hours. I don't know, I'm just. It's just two dudes talking or whatever and a guest and talk. No band. No, you're a fucking band. Come on. What are you a baby and I need to play music for you. I think people would take great comfort in that, but the problem is you can't do it because of the way TV works. Every single thing that anybody says on tv, he's got to go through a filter and that's the, what do you call it, the regulatory bureau that makes sure people say that. People say things that aren't like curse words or what's that called? There's a name for it. Standards and practices, so everything has to run through that. So I think that the idea of having. And you could do it on Hbo, I guess you'd have to have it on a.

Speaker 1:          02:06:33       on a non a public station. It needs to be a subscription TV station. You could probably pull that off, but you can't do it on NBC. You can't have people talk for three hours because inevitably somebody is going to start really saying the truth or they're going to start saying a truth that doesn't fit in with selling cell phones in mass, and that's going to be. They're not going to like that. When you do stand up on those shows, you've got to show them your set, right? They analyze every line, every sentence, every word gets analyzed. You have to show them like a written transcript of things are going to say. Can you imagine if we tried to show a network this transcript of what we talked about here today, like the notes, how many I. I imagined that we would get over 7,000 pages of notes back. I bet the notes that we get would be 500 times longer than the episode itself. Did I ever tell you that? My friend Amir was a writer on the early, early, early days of Conan. Now through a lot of comics wrote for Conan in the early, early days,

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       and my friend Amir, Amir Golan, he was, his name is James Lemur. That was a stage name. Really Funny Dude from Boston, he and so I was there for the early, early filmings when I was like, you know, I guess I was like kind of working maybe like just starting to work and go, well I didn't have any money and I was told scrub, but I was his friends. I went to botch and they, they all, the Andy Richter, Conan O'brien interactions were scripted. One hundred percent scripted. They had cue cards above them so they weren't talking. They were fake. They're fake talking like, like if you and I, we're going to talk about this right now and it would have all this shit that I was going to say already written out and it was a sign behind each other, like a sign behind the Indian guy holding the sign behind Kona because we're talking about like 1990 or some shit.

Speaker 6:          02:08:23       When did the Conan O'brien show start? What year did the Conan O'brien show start? I'm going to say like 91 or 92. Somewhere around there. That's if I had to guess at the latest, I could think it'd be like 93. But it was weird. Weird. It's really weird. It's like you're watching pirates of the Caribbean or something, so it's straight, but they don't do that anymore. Thank God. But I mean he had to go to fucking tbs to probably get rid of the 93. There we go. That was pretty close. Yeah. I don't get that man. I mean it's so I, I can't wait for that to change. That's. TV's going to get so much better. They don't do that anymore. Nobody does. Nobody does that. They did that because he was a writer who did that because he was a writer. They really didn't have a performance background and all of a sudden he was hosting this late night talk show because he was so funny because in writer's rooms, Conan O'brien would just smash.

Speaker 6:          02:09:11       He was the guy. He was so fucking funny and his jokes were so good that in writer's rooms they will like Jesus Christ, you should be a fucking comic. Like should be. You should be the host of a show. And then the next thing you know, a bunch of people got behind him and they said, listen, we're gonna bankroll him. I'll have him do the guy. And you know, once he loosened up and got used to the role, I mean, you know, he became like one of a lot of people's favorite. Watching the early show and watching them do it. Like what a script. It was very enlightenment. What would you do this as a late night show to. I'm sure you've gotten. Someone has got. Must've come to you by now. This is early morning show. It's a late night show. It's a mid afternoon show. It's available whenever you want it. It's 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And. But do you ever think about like how, how often do you think about translating it to the TV environment or something? Never. Almost never. Almost never. You must get pitched all the time. No, I don't know. I don't even, I don't even take pitches.

Speaker 6:          02:10:11       I don't want to do anything other than what I'm doing right now. I've thought about it before and you know the, the experience of doing the spike TV thing, the Scifi thing rather. What was fun was doing with you. That's what it was. Fun. That was what was fun, but it's not fun dealing with all those other people. Not The people that we worked with. Although the producers on that side were great and a lot of people in the networks that were great, but there were so many voices. It wasn't even that they were bad folks. You're dealing with too many people in it. Everybody's got discrepancies and I think it should go like this and maybe you should try that. Or maybe you can come in here. Maybe he could dress different. Maybe you could hold that or maybe you could stand there like, fuck man.

Speaker 6:          02:10:44       There's too many of you talking like, look, we're trying to make the best thing, but you're not the person that's going to like figure me out. Okay. I've got a good sense of who I am and if you want me to wear a suit and tie and you think it's going to change. If I come in on a parachute or if I step out of a fucking flaming Hula Hoop, we're talking crazy. I don't want to do that. Like if I had, if I want to sit down with some comedy writers and bounce around some ideas, I don't want a year to many people's voices and that. I mean it's their prerogative. I mean if you're, if you're on a television show or somebody wants to pay for it, right? And it's not you. So it's their prerogative to do that. But I don't want to be. I don't, I just don't think I operate the best doing that.

Speaker 6:          02:11:23       Right. I don't think this podcast would have ever occurred if I had a boss who would have never happened now and most of this shit I would've never said and I would have to like debate who the guests were. The idea of debating who the guests are make me wants to. I just want to throw up like the idea of have to convince someone that Joey Diaz should be on Tuesday. I've got to convince them. I know Joe has been on two months ago, but it doesn't matter. You need a black guy. You need a black woman. That's what you need on your podcast, a black woman. What we're looking at your diversity statistics, right? I'm going to do what the fuck I want to do and do whatever I want to do, and the only way to do whatever you want to do is to do your own thing.

Speaker 6:          02:11:59       As soon as you start doing it on television, you're not doing whatever you want to do unless you become wildly successful like south park, to the point where they just leave you the fuck alone and new regimes come and go while you're still the king. They just, they don't say shit to Daniel Tosh. Everybody just shuts the fuck up and leaves them alone. You don't want to fuck that up. You got a monolithic show. Lucky South Park. It's been going on forever and it's just as funny now as it's ever been. Just stay the fuck away from them or don't talk to them. Don't ruin anything.

Speaker 3:          02:12:27       Are there any examples of a show where they let them do whatever they want at and the show failed because of it? I'm sure. I'm sure there have been no what it is. I don't know. There's got to be generally always here with like Mr show or like a lot of the great sketch groups or like any great show. One thing you always hear, it's like they mostly just let us do what we want it and it's the. It's when the opposite effect happens.

Speaker 6:          02:12:52       Well, that's what the Chappelle show. That's what broke the Chappelle show up. Dave Chappelle was like, fuck this. There's too many people telling them what to do. Saying them that he couldn't say certain things, couldn't you know? There was a lot of money on the line for that show. He's talked about it. He's talked about. They wouldn't let him say the word nigger. Like there was a. There was a real concern with him continuing to say that word. That's crazy. And they were saying that if he didn't say they could make more money in advertising, I would love to really sit down with him and find out what was. What was like, what was the feeling when all that was happening? What was the feeling of being connected to this cultural monster rage? I was on it twice, but I didn't. I didn't really talk to them about.

Speaker 6:          02:13:35       It was in the time. It was just like, wow, this is great. Dane's got this awesome show. That's hilarious. Holy Shit. Fuck. I'd love to be on it. It was one of those things. It wasn't like, like, what is this like for you? Like, like now having the podcast. I'd be like, what is it? What is the feeling of everywhere you go. I'm Rick James Pitch. Yeah. Did that fuck with you? Because I know people used to heckle him with that and it was like a real problem. Right? Like people would heckle. They would yell that out. You know, everybody was yelling out, I'm Rick James Bitch. It was ridiculous. They got to the point where they would yell it out and he couldn't even compete continuous show because like dumb white kids, it'd be yelling out, I'm Rick James Bitch. So bad. It's so fucked up is that.

Speaker 6:          02:14:14       But obviously he made it through it, but the point being what a weird experience that must have been just to be a human being, to be at the tip of the comedy spear like that for a while and then have a bunch of people fuck with it. Have a bunch of people just wouldn't make David. You need to listen to David, David two lane. Uh, Mr Chappelle thing about all the money you're leaving on the table. How many people telling him what words to use. And not to say that don't be yourself. No, no, no. We need to do, to be a little better packaged. We're trying to make money here. David's right. We're trying to make money. And so he walked away like a gangster from some, like $50 million dollar deal. That's right. Good. See Ya. Integrity. That guy's got serious integrity man. Through his, through his pores. How many people would down a lot of people who would not walk me?

Speaker 1:          02:15:09       Yeah. Would be like the n word. It's unimportant. You know? I think bill crosby wants to saying that. I'm like, yeah, I was thinking I definitely wanted it for a second. What I was thinking for a second, I was thinking of like other people in my mind I'm going to be like, yeah, they definitely wouldn't work him. And I'm like judgmental shit. Fucking top of it, Paul. If people walk away, you as I look, I hosted fear factor. Sure. I'll change my name. What'd you want to call me? Yeah, sure. Senior poopy pants shall be senior boot. Oh yeah, I'll share. I'll go into the float tanks and someone just shit it ain't no prob mats me Senor poopy pants for Citibank. Mastercard. Citibank. Mastercard is the best mastercard. It's the one senior poopy pants. Use it. Why not? You know what? But why he wasn't Chappelle. Kind of

Speaker 6:          02:16:04       like wasn't, isn't he? I don't know if he's still is busy. Kind of like an illuminati believer, like aren't there interviews with him where he kind of talks about, well look, I don't know. I haven't had these conversations with him personally, so I don't know the full extent of his beliefs, but he believes in some shit that's real. Like the Bilderberg group, the fact that these industrial, it's really do get together and meet and try

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       to figure out how to continue running the world the way it's run right now because they're extracting massive amounts of money from it. I mean that's real. We know that the Bilderberg group, those are real meetings. We know that the federal bank. Okay. W We know how that works. We know that the federal bank isn't bank. It's not federal. It's just it's a privately owned company. We know that international banks and as well as well as the banks in this country have all done all sorts of horrible shit involving laundering money and gotten little slaps on the wrist and a little baby fines and when they're about to fall apart, our own tax dollars are used to step in and save these fuckheads. We all know all that, yet we all know that. We just sort of accept it.

Speaker 7:          02:17:19       Yeah. Kennedy shot in broad daylight.

Speaker 1:          02:17:23       There's so much of what it is to be a person that runs a government that no one other than that person or those people is ever going to understand. I think it's probably like a helpless position where you realize once you get there like, Oh God, this isn't. Nobody does this. Right. It can't be done. Right. Right. Literally can't be done. I'm going to try to do my best to get some healthcare pushed through some other, some other things. Maybe gay marriage, gay marriage on the books. Fuck Yeah, man, that guy's having a great week. Great Week. He really is. Yeah. I, you know. Yeah. I don't know. We don't know. That is the belief that the president has a kind of hapless victim that gets pulled into a web of darkness and does the best that he can do is certainly more comforting than the other version of the story, which is that it's just somebody who's a narcissist to trick themselves into thinking they were some capital is Jesus and then they're going to walk across the stage of history and create incredible changes for the better in the world while hoping to God that the people you're creating the changes for.

Speaker 1:          02:18:31       We'll forget about the countless children you've transformed into hamburger meat

Speaker 7:          02:18:35       from dropping bombs at a drop drawings on top of them accidentally and they we do because maybe it is a game. You start thinking, is it. This is like a game of thrones style universe where you know every decision that you make are five percent of the decisions you make are going to result in someone dying and someone not dying and you're forced into the predicament of saying, wow. I guess if I have to pick between dying and not dying, I'm going to pick people from the country. I'm currently the president of over the people from the country. I'm not the president of. That's going to be the decision I have to make because that's the oath that I've sworn. So yeah, from time to time I'm going to, I'm going to explode some fucking kids and I'm also gonna get gay marriage legalized and I'm also going to help ease the prohibition on marijuana and then once a month while

Speaker 1:          02:19:22       I will completely destroy a village. Fuck that. Fuck that job. Indeed. Jobs insane. It's insane. It's insane. And being a cop and being a cop's insane. Saul. Insane. Well, yeah. Well, jobs are insane, but you got to suck it back down to your job. Like where you're at, man. I mean that's the thing. Like my brain will go, go in those directions so much, you know? Uh. Did you see Obama or here Obama on Marin? I absolutely did. I didn't hear it yet. Good. Oh, that's a good interview, man. He did a great job, man. I was super. One of my favorite part of the interview. Uh, one thing that happened, I heard Marin on a bunch of interviews afterwards because everybody's like, what the fuck is that like to get to interview the president? And he was remarking on how Obama put him at ease, like how Obama was really good at putting him at ease, like it's his podcast, but Obama, just this master of like getting them to relax and now so that he could do the interview and not be nervous because you could hear him at the beginning, just like most people, he said he sounded a little nervous as you shouldn't use the fucking president were secret service.

Speaker 1:          02:20:34       Uh, all over your goddamn house they have, they had to block the window out with garbage bags because there was a sight line where there could have been a sniper on a roof. There's a sniper on the roof of his fucking house. Man in his intro, he's like, there's a sniper up my roof. My neighbors hate me. They shut off the whole street. Like they came to his house, you know, it came. Why did he do it as house? What did he just do it at a place where they can secure it gets bad. That's bad. It's a bad ass decision because it's about us. They must have been like, you know, that they were like, do we have to do it at your house? And he must've been like, we're going to do it at my fucking house. He did it. He wore his flannel.

Speaker 1:          02:21:11       That was another bad decision. Mark Marin Morris fucking flannel in the United States. No suit, no change of attire. That's, that is his attire though. That's his outfit. Much like you're a bishop and I'm a NASA guy. That's right. I will think about what you said. He wore his flannel so he puts his out sake. You were like a grateful dead tee shirt or a fucking wife. But a lot of people, they're like, I'm in the president, I'm going to present to the president, I'm going to wear a Tuxedo or whatever. But that dresses in his normal attire. That was pretty cool. And then, um, the interview itself was really great. It was like, it was like Obama was very funny and they were, it was like they're great funny moments and that one of my favorite lines in the interview was a Obama like mentions like Mark Marin mentions black helicopters and he's like, but there's no black helicopters. Right? And Obama was like, there are black helicopters, they just are in other countries more than we use them here. But he did say they're black helicopters. It's kind of everybody knows that I know. But it was a funny thing for the president to hear it out of the president's mouth and it kind of funny way. But again, man, you know, outside of the how incredibly charismatic, affable and how grateful I am to a lot of the shit the Obama administration has done healthcare. And I know a lot

Speaker 3:          02:22:25       of people out there fucking hate what he's done. But as somebody who has had cancer, knowing that if I wanted to get insurance, if my insurance lapsed or something and they're not going to do what they usually do, which is a uh, uh, they would investigate you before you couldn't get insurance for days and days and days. They would investigate you to find out if you have previous health conditions and you couldn't get insurance so you'd have to, like, you could die or you get shitty healthcare. Uh, it's cool to know that a lot of people don't have to deal with that shit. I think it's cool. I know it's not a perfect system and from a libertarian perspective, I, I know a lot of you probably have good reasons to really hate it, but I think there's a lot of good reasons to not hit it too. So I'm grateful for that. Marijuana seems to be becoming legal during his administration, even though his administration has done a lot of shit to obstruct research on marijuana, things seemed to be changing. Gay Marriage is now legal. That's under his administration. All those things. The whistleblower stole that Shit. See, that's the shit that bugs me, man. And asked him about that. No, I don't think so. I didn't. I actually, I had to. I didn't. I was listening to you.

Speaker 5:          02:23:30       Well, I'll have to listen to it to see if he did because that's super important subject and the idea that someone who's doing what they think is the right thing for humanity by expressing they have a huge issue with the legality of certain actions that are, that are commonplace. It's fucked mean he seen, he seen these things happen on a daily basis and he thinks they're unconstitutional and now he's hiding in Russia,

Speaker 3:          02:23:55       man, than how. How crazy is that? To me, this is where you get into this problem with presidents were and they kind of remind you of like, Oh fucking uncle, uncle Jack. What a cool guy. Right? He's a super sweet guys. Really awesome. He's so fun. The kids really love him. Everybody likes Uncle Jack, but there's a car jacker. You'll either that or he's like molesting someone and you're supposed to ignore the fact. This is in families where I actually was listening to this great documentary on npr about the phenomena of why that kind of shit is sexual abuse will happen in a family and keep happening in a family because to acknowledge it is to implode the family to acknowledge it is to that family is done and it happened. This is when those. I don't, I don't even know. I wasn't following the newest thing that happened when that weird religious group of people where there was sexual abuse that happened.

Speaker 3:          02:24:54       I can't even remember their names. So it's in relation to that, but the doers, right? So the Duggar's, so you in a family, if you like, admit that this is happening, father, mother, uncle, whoever is doing this thing, you will transform the terrain of that family permanently. Right? So in the same way with, with the president, you know, it's, we're almost being asked to do the same exact thing, which is like take the good. He makes great hamburgers, he gives the gate candy. He's like really fun. He's got a slip and slide, but for God's sake, never mentioned the time. Two years ago when you were standing behind the tool shed, he slid his finger into your asshole because if you do that, it's fucking ruined our family in the same way we would with like that with Obama. Man. You're not supposed to you. You just are like, all right. Just ignore the fact that right now we're dealing with for profit prisons. One of the greatest heroes of our time, snowden was a real patriot, is having to hide in fucking Russia right now because we were supposed to ignore the fact. Even if Obama can't change it, can he come out at a press conference and say, I support and endorse what snowden did. Okay. I

Speaker 6:          02:26:10       can't say that because then people will be able to just hack into anything they want and take information that the government has distributed all around the world and oh fuck up all sorts of counter terrorism activities. They're doing fuck up all sorts of surveillance that they've got going on with real questionable people. That might be some fucking isis character. Yeah, but I mean the whole you gotta you're supposed to like kind of devil's advocate buddy. I know you are, but and you literally are playing devil's advocate, but I don't mean to. I don't mean to like get all constitutional and everything, but isn't the point of the president to uphold the constitution and isn't, but I don't think the constitution existed when it was created with the understanding of the Internet, with the understanding of the distribution of information, with the understanding of covert intelligence, with the understanding of terrorism, with the understanding of a lot of things.

Speaker 6:          02:27:03       I think that was a real problem was that first of all, when, when he did tell everybody that the NSA spying on every fucking American on the planet, they lied. Right? That's bad. That's a huge problem. That's one problem. And second of all, there's no rational justification. There was no significant number of terrorism events. They've. They've stopped it while compromising the privacy of everybody. Then they started talking about how I was just metadata and that wasn't true either. It's not just metadata. People were going into the the emails of their ex boyfriends and girlfriends and reading their shit and downloading pictures on their computers. They're doing whatever the fuck they wanted to do and they can do whatever the fuck they want to do because they have this autonomy. They have this power working for the NSA, but what he was saying was like, he was like, I didn't even graduate from college, and he goes and I have access to all this stuff and I'm just a normal person. I'm around a bunch of other people. Yeah, and I got this information. I leak. I got this information out to people. What's the stop all these other people from taking information. What's to stop them from sharing it with each other and passing it back and forth? Nothing. Nothing. Obviously if he was he able to leak as much as he leaked. What? What? What safeguards are in place for People's privacy? Believe very little and whether or not you're doing anything wrong, whether or not you need to

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       worry about it, that's not the argument. The argument is it fundamentally changes the relationship that you have with another person. The same way being a cop changes the relationship. When you're talking to someone that you think is committing a crime, all of a sudden you have power over that person's information. They don't have any over. You could say, sit down, put your fucking hands over your head. You'd be like, no, fuck you. You sit down stupid fucking tumble and your role with your stupid uniform on. Don't put a point a gun at me. I need to sit down because you're pointing a gun at me. You're an asshole or you need to put your hands behind your back. I'm going to handcuff you because I don't trust you pointing a gun at me. Pay Your bills, dude. I pay your bills and you're pointing a gun at me or my daughter.

Speaker 4:          02:29:01       Right, but no one is going to accept that. No one's going to accept that you're not gonna. Accept that because a cop thinks he's a cop and it's similar in a lot of ways. It's similar. The idea that someone has access to Duncan trussell's email, but you don't have access to. There's no. You don't even know they're there checking in on you. They have power over you and observing you, making sure you don't fuck up. Guess what? Just like how, when you're talking about those, uh, those experiments that they do on subatomic particles and waves and other quantum shit with the observer changes the effect. Guess what? When you fucking follow someone around and observed the shit out of 'em, uh, changes them and changes them similar to that stupid double blind double slit experiment. It's a wave and it's a particle. You're innocent, but you're also a criminal for diff.

Speaker 4:          02:29:45       Constantly following you trying to look yet changes. You fucking changes the way you feel if someone's hounding you and fucking with you. It changes you. Yeah, man, it's. Yeah, that didn't, you know, that's the thing. It's like, it's such a confused. It's such a confusing thing to hear. I mean, I hear such an affable, cool guy, done some really great things and to know that this other shit is going on. It's just kinda sad man. It'd be so beautiful if, uh, you know, he, he had actually shut down Guantanamo, like the, the, uh, staff coming back about either treating those poor bastards like raw, you know, they're just like force feeding them even though they want to die so they're not even letting them die. They're keeping them alive like something from the hellraiser dimension, just shoving tubes into their throat and putting protein gel into their bellies.

Speaker 4:          02:30:35       And a lot of these guys, I'm sure some of them are not great people, but I think a lot of them are probably, they haven't even been given a trial. You know, there's a lot of them that got interested in alternative ways to govern and live lives and alternative philosophies and religions and our alternative ideologies and maybe even militant ideologies that were curious. They were curious about. It doesn't mean that they've committed any crimes. Doesn't mean that they've. I mean they might be, but they might not be. But the idea that all you have to do is just be interested in these things and they can lock you out a lock you up. That's there's a thought crime aspect to that. That's really scary. We got to hold. The thing is, God, this sounds so cliche, but you gotta hold your leaders accountable. You must hold leaders accountable and we haven't doing it. It

Speaker 7:          02:31:20       doesn't happen and because it doesn't happen, they keep taking more liberties and the problem is we don't know how to hold our leaders accountable because they're in charge of everything. So that's the predicament outside of holding them accountable by voting or hold the, you know, that's one way to do it, but it's a really confusing, you know, again, and again, you hear the term war criminal thrown in the direction of the Bush administration and you know, I don't know if it's true or not, but I know there's never going to be a trial. I know that there's never going to be any, anything, even close to a real investigation into why we went to war there and what we did while we were there and all that shit just kind of gets swept down the river of history and you're invited to ignore it and look in the direction of the progressive things that are happening and they're great, but then because great things are happening does not mean that you ignore all the other dark shit that's happening and it doesn't mean that you're being a conspiracy theorist or negative or pessimistic because you won't let go of the fact that the last few presidents who've maybe done some shit that is, seems to go directly against the rules that were written down and whatever this current game of being an American is.

Speaker 7:          02:32:37       And everybody's got to be held to those rules. If everyone's not held to those rules, then we're all supposed to either wander around in a state of denial and pretend that everything's cool and it isn't. Or we have to like, I don't know. What

Speaker 6:          02:32:51       did you hear about this? Uh, there's a great article that I tweeted yesterday, Isis and the lonely young American, it's about this girl who's a 23 year old Sunday school teacher and a babysitter and she was a, she converted to Islam. She was lonely. She was living with her grandparents. She converted to Islam and it goes over this long slow sort of story where it's just like you, you understand like who she is and how she got sucked in and she fucking joins isis. Isis like offers her like some, some feeling of belonging and she, she goes through this process to join isis. I don't want to tell you any more of it. I just want people to read it because it's really fascinating and it's, it's. It also highlights an aspect of adhering to ideologies that a lot of people don't want to admit is that people are extremely vulnerable because we don't want to be alone.

Speaker 6:          02:33:40       And a lot of times when you see someone who is absolutely committed to something, whether. I mean, how many times did people like seeing that Bob Ross guy committing to painting and they wanted to become a painter because it's attractive when you see someone who's into something you want to Julia Child Cook or Anthony Bourdain Cook, you want to cook like God damn, I don't want to cook too. How's exciting? Well, when you see someone who's like really into being a Muslim or really into being a Buddhist or really into being a lot of things, you get sucked into it. The archetype of like the Yogi, like the people that are like that fake bullshit sot nom you know, no mas De, you know those guys. It was like an archetype that they sort of follow into and they fall into it because when you see it, it looks like super attractive.

Speaker 6:          02:34:21       Like, Oh wow, that is like really spiritual. I want to be like him. Well, there's people that are like that. They're alone and they're sad and they're vulnerable and being a Muslim looks like a good idea to them. Or being a Mormon looks like a good idea to them being in in some sort of a group that accepts you and pulls you in the zero. They're giving you interaction and that's this. This story is really fascinating because it's something that I've always felt compelled by because I felt minorly compelled by all sorts of different religions in my life will like I will watch like even speeches are radical Islamic speeches when these guys are talking in front of these people, in other parts of the world that speak English, but they're giant populations of them, but there's something attractive even though he's saying nobody shit about.

Speaker 6:          02:35:04       It says in the Koran, you're supposed to stone adulterers and it says in the Koran, but they're good going over like, how could you? How could you possibly know better than God? This is the. Is this not the greatest answer to this problem that God has provided and everyone will clap. He goes, thank you. Then exactly like this is Islam, and he was going on and that was like the confidence that this guy has and what he's saying becomes attractive even to me. Even to me, okay, I'm nowhere near joining Islam. I'm nowhere near joining Isis. I'm nowhere near becoming a mormon. I'm becoming a scientologist, but you know what I'm saying? Man, I'm watching this, but I feel the draw. Everyone feels a little bit because the guy is, he's compelling and and a lot of them are religious people. People that believe in wholeheartedly in everything that they're saying and they have charisma and they have passion behind it. Like I don't have those things. I want to be like him because I feel like he's giving off positive, strong energy and if he's right, if he's right about God and God really is on the side of the righteous and he will lead us towards God damn. Guys seem super convinced. I'm not convinced of anything like that, but you get drawn into it.

Speaker 7:          02:36:13       I think one thing that you're overlooking is the idea that I was at sheldrake. He talks about, I think he used the term ease is the term Murrano how like certain belief systems create Ronald's and the time space continuum or like they. It kind of like like you know, like in Conan when he's walking around in the wheel, the wheel and it he like he did like from walking around so many times. There's actually like a trench that he takes out. His groove comes to, exist in the universe and those grooves are the major world religions and so you know right now, not only are people shitting and float tanks, but right now at this very moment, people and mosques in great numbers all across the planet or intoning these very sacred words that come from a mystical book and they're singing them and that creates a resonance that you can tune into at anytime that you want to.

Speaker 7:          02:37:09       And that's the poll that I believe you're feeling. It's more than just I want to fit in or I want to be a disciplined person. It's like you start by dipping your toe in this river of subjective universe, which is whatever religion it is that you're exploring and then you stick in your foot and then you stick in your other foot and the next thing you know that motherfucker will suck you in and we'll pull you into the into that particular dance that a group of people are doing and it's a very beautiful dance to beautiful thing to watch. We've talked about this a million times before, but when you're watching that and credible drift of pilgrims is they're moving around that. What's the name of the cop that. What's it called? The Kaaba Makkah, but it's called. I don't know what it's called, but I know we're talking about and it's got a media right in it and his beautiful surging ocean of people dressed in white or like touching the stone and it's incredible to watch and it's really does help me to write in it. Right? I think it's immediate. It's a black state. I think it's a media. It's a blackstone hold us up and it's rundown from other fingers touching them and if you think all those people in that swirl of humanity or isis level, fundamentalist lunatic assholes, you're just tricking yourself because you want the universe to be black and white and it's not. A lot of those people are really very advanced beings who have just been drawn into the particular way that the universe expresses itself.

Speaker 5:          02:38:34       This is not to be trusted because it's one of those World News daily report. Dr. Trusted. What did they say? It is Saudi Arabia. Blackstone of Mecca. Blackstone of Mecca revealed to be a media. Right. It's a real problem with that. Websites were printed though.

Speaker 7:          02:38:50       I mean, I don't know what it is. It's. It's price. Something weird though. Media, right. Worship of the blocks down. There's more than one website that says that. I'm got to go to wikipedia and look up. Blacks done for some reason. Wikipedia Islam's media at the circle. At the Kaaba. The Kaaba. Yeah, that's what it's called. I'm googling it right in front of her.

Speaker 5:          02:39:12       Page two. It says worship. It's not what worship are Muslims, but it is a media right inside that thing though the Capa stone, but it is. Right. So even if it's not worshiped by Muslims, it's at the center of their worship spot. I think that's probably significant.

Speaker 7:          02:39:28       Yeah, that's pretty crazy. But you know, and the other black stone, do you ever play as it is that it right. There isn't the only image of blackstone or hygiene. Oral as swabbed is the eastern corner stone of the Kaaba that the agent still building, located in the center of the Grand Mosque in Mecca. It is revered by Muslims is an Islamic relic, which according to Muslim tradition dates back to the time of Adam and eve.

Speaker 5:          02:39:53       Dude, go to the Google image search and you can see the actual thing. It looks like a vagina. It's like the vagina of the universe. Could imagine if that was like that. Literally is the vagina of the universe more like

Speaker 7:          02:40:08       a belly button. Oh yeah. It does have a kind of very vaginal wow. The region

Speaker 6:          02:40:14       there and touching the vagina of the universe.

Speaker 6:          02:40:18       Well, I mean if that was a media right. Okay, and that means it came crashing down to earth from the Schuylkill, smoothly touching it. I don't know where you've been buying your walnuts. I can go to a new place. Looks like a dragon egg. It looks like a vagina. Goddamn man. It's a dragon egg. It's a vagina. So if you think about it, birth life came out of impact. If it wasn't for the impact of comments, we wouldn't have water apparently. Is that true? I believe that water came from comments. I've heard that. I don't know if they know that for sure, but we do know for sure that if it wasn't for the meteor impact that killed the dinosaurs, we'd be fucked. We would not have made it. Okay. We've got neat and everywhere you look, giant fucking dinosaurs have a loss of raptors t rexes.

Speaker 6:          02:41:05       You never figured out the airplane. If there was terra data, you are taking too much time. You fly around a jackie would eat you. You'd be like, fuck, we can't fly yet. We gotta kill all the carryback dose and that you'd never get to them because you can't fly. So how are you going to get to them? You'd have to get to the point where you invented the the jet, like a fighter jet where there was no Tara Dac dolls. That was the only way, and then you have to fly over to where the fuck they are. Make sure you have a big tank of gas and Jack All. Make sure you kill all of them. Then you can spread air travel. Imagine if you had to try and sell tickets for American Airlines and you might get taken out by Tara dactyl the fuck out of here.

Speaker 6:          02:41:39       No one's going to fly anywhere. Most people wouldn't even fly on an airline that has a last name. Asia, right? At this point, people are terrified about things drop into the ocean. If there was tared axles in the event of a pterodactyl attack, do not panic. The key is to look like an egg. They can't see very well. The only they don't move. They use egg edge detection in the very unlikely event of a pterodactyl attack. It's like, well, I feel. I feel like that when I go swimming in the ocean. It's like, you know, sharks are the terra data. How's that see there? These ancient to mouth that are just monsters grow. Yeah. That one in North Carolina, like jaws is happening in North Carolina. Well, how about two people got their arms cut off inside of the day. She's two people an hour apart from each other. Cut Their fucking arms bitten off. First of all. That second dude, did he know about the first two because that changes everything for a second. Dude knew about the first dude in new. They didn't catch the shark yet. He's probably like, well fuck man is full now. Swimming in Hawaii when there's shark attacks, you know, on Maui and we were there. So many d I e deed.

Speaker 6:          02:42:47       Sure the kids are listening. Oh my God. Yeah. We had to tell. We haven't talked about that. That did happen when I was there. Dude happens all the time. Yeah, sure happens. Yeah. They like to keep that shit on the DL. You know, they'll talk about on the news out there, but the people on the island, they're not scared. You know? I mean, they just, that's just life. That's, that's the, the life that they live, they don't want to get eaten by sharks, but when I was there one time I was there and someone and another

Speaker 5:          02:43:11       time I was there and there was a news report. Totally different time where this dude got jacked. He was fucked up. He was in the hospital, his leg was fucking eating apart and he was just talking about what it felt like and I was friend rescued him and then the whole, this is a regular occurrence. I'm talking about two separate trips to Hawaii to fucking shark attacks. Both took place while I was there. I was a little buzzed and almost fell down a volcano inside. Well not inside, but like on the far side of it, like because there's a fucking damn this beautiful observation place where you could look at a volcano and yeah man, I. There was a bar and I vote who I like had a couple of Margarita is. And then we were standing out there and like I, I kinda stumbled for a second and realize I could've just gone sliding down volcanic rock.

Speaker 5:          02:43:54       It wouldn't have been into lava. Which will be a glorious way to die. No, you would have broken your legs and starve to death and you'd be on like 18th youtube videos, especially if you have a Gopro gopro video of the dude who was on the motorcycle got hit by a truck. Now you haven't seen it. You saw it. Does he die? Brian showed it to me the other night. Um, no. He might as well be dead though. He's just fucked beyond repair. This is going fast and he hit on collides with the truck. God dammit. Dude, that sucks. Woo. It's crazy to watch. Do you want to watch it? Okay. Let's see. Let's add this to the beaker. Goddammit. This the tough.

Speaker 5:          02:44:36       Are you fucking kidding me dude? I mean, this is a fucking madness. Uploaded the video he must have. So he's okay. I don't know. I mean someone else picks up the Gopro and starts filming him. He's good enough to upload videos. No, no, no, no, no. Someone else picks up the Gopro, but like, stop. I can't watch this anymore. You can't play more than two times. Well, I hope he's doing okay now. He's much better. He might have. He has nationwide need home insurance. Geico. Which ones? Cars. I'm a saying in my hands are sweating from watching that. Like feel. Feel my hand right now. Feel Jesus Christ. Yeah, I'm soaked. Hyperhidrosis. What does that sweaty lets me, dude. I'm hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis. The Myth of height. Hyperhidrosis. Yeah. I get nervous anytime I get nervous. My hands sweat. Like crazy guy. Mind to my body just thinks like you better run.

Speaker 5:          02:45:36       Run like no, we're just about to take a test. No fucking run. Dude. Fucking run. No, no, no, no, no. We're just watching a youtube video. No, no. The fucking truck is coming. Fucking run. I see the bike going towards the truck and my hands start sweating like they have to just run away somehow. I don't know what's going on with your body. Like heating up. Like it thinks it's a. it's preparing to burst. I don't know. It's a great question because it doesn't seem like it's going to help like sweaty palms. It's like worse. If you want to grab onto something, it's going to be harder to do it. It seems weird. I don't worst. It's not good for anything. Yeah. Your. Your grip gets

Speaker 6:          02:46:10       slippery for a pool. It's like it was always a plague of mine. I used to actually spray anti perspirant I'm a hands. Oh Wow. Yeah, and then I found this stuff called. It's called like hands dry or dry hands or something like that. It's essentially like antiperspirant for people that have a problem with the doing something, need to have dry hands. Now it's squirted on my hands and rub it, rub it all over my hands and then it would allow me to play pool better where I could concentrate on just playing. I didn't have to worry about my hands wiping them down every five minutes like I used to drink. I used to bring a wet towel with me that would wipe my hands with a wet towel and then I would drive them off with a dry towel and I had to do that over and over and over again.

Speaker 6:          02:46:48       My hands are sweating for no reason, no reason. It was a stupid game, knocking the ball into another ball and I'm like life and death. Life and death. My body temperature is changing. I'm sweating, sweating over a fucking game. Wasn't even for a lot of money, you know, playing a tournament or playing with a buddy and my hands are sweating like an asshole. Yes. Sweats. Fucking weird, isn't it? What a strange thing that your body just squirts out. Saltwater whenever it gets too hot, freaks out. Well, I've been on a hot yoga tear last two and a half months. I got to tell you, first of all, there's two things that have been doing the last two and a half months really regularly. And I know one of them is not feasible for a lot of people, so don't complain. And that's cryotherapy. I know that Shit's expensive, like 60 bucks every time you do it.

Speaker 6:          02:47:32       I'm fucking addicted dude. I do it almost everyday. Where do you do it? I do it down here in woodland hills. They have a place on Ventura Boulevard, cryo healthcare. There's another place in la, but there's a lot of people that do it. They just, um, it's not as effective, but it's pretty fucking effective. Just an ice bath. Just fill up a tank filled with water or a tub rather filled with water and a lot of fucking ice and just climb on it and it's a box, but there's something that happens when you ice yourself down like that. The decrease of inflammation makes you feel fucking fantastic and it allows your body to heal more effectively. Like dude, extreme cold is incredible for inflammation, so I've done it every day except the weekends. I didn't do it the weekend he did apparently to do today, right before the show.

Speaker 6:          02:48:17       I do it. I do it, try to do it five days a week these days and I'm doing it five days a week and I fucking feel fantastic. Fantastic. I've heard that all my like little aches and pains, they're all like diminishing significantly. Everything seems to be like loosening up and relaxing, like what's the mechanics of that? Like what? Explain it. But the other thing I'm doing is hot yoga and the hot yoga in combination with that is very interesting because I've been doing the hot yoga at least two days a week and then I'll do like some other stretches, like a third day a week with my other workouts that I do. But I'm forcing myself to do two days a week of hot yoga. It's fucking hard, dude. It's hard to do like surprisingly hard. And the. When the class is almost over, I'm fucking exhausted.

Speaker 6:          02:49:01       I mean like really exhausted and so hot that I want to quit. I want to quit. Like the last 10 minutes is don't be a bitch. That's the last 10 minutes. All the exercises are fairly easy and it's just don't leave yet. Don't leave yet. Hang in there. Don't leave yet. Hang in there. And your body's like, dude is too fucking hot near. You've got to just deal with it. Just deal with it and get through. And there's this. I don't know if you've ever seen the podcasts I've done with Dr Rhonda Patrick. Nope. I can't wait to talk to her about this, but she's just brilliant, brilliant lady, and she wrote a paper about sauna and one of the things about Saunas is that they've experienced this radical decrease in mortality rates amongst people who take sauna and she was like, it's a 40 percent decrease across the board.

Speaker 6:          02:49:44       Everything with like cancer, heart attacks, all these different things. There's an effect that's happening. You mean like a steam hyper heat? The Body Saunas? Yeah. You go into a sauna, hot sauna. There's something that happens when you extreme, when you extremely heat up the body where the body has to respond to the heat and then it develops this reaction to these extreme temperatures for short durations. Now I don't know how much time you're supposed to sit in a sauna, but the time that you sit in a sauna, whatever happens to your body, once you get out and your body cools itself down and there is a compensatory mechanism that helps your body in some crazy way that they're still trying to understand now, and the same can be said for Cryo therapy and cryotherapy. I think it's called sidechains, like when you get below 150 degrees, your body produces these anti inflammatory responses.

Speaker 6:          02:50:30       There's Pub Med studies on it. There's a bunch of different studies explained to her. I don't understand. You don't because you're only in there for three minutes. Seems like a long time. Seems like a long time while you're in there too, but it's enough that you can get out of it. Like when it gets more than three minutes, it gets real tricky and you don't have to. You don't touch anything like your hands are in gloves, surgical mask on your face. You have earmuffs and the extremities are covered. Your extremities are covered with gloves and your toes are covered with socks. And then you wear crocs. So you're standing in rubber crocs, so your feet don't touch the out of your cock. Your cock is in your underwear. Believe it or not, the congress doesn't get that cold. I mean, I deal with it. I deal with my cock, my legs get cold, my, my, um, my nipples get fucking cold.

Speaker 6:          02:51:09       Sometimes I wind up doing this. I want to cover my nipples, but for the most part what's happening is your body is freaking the fuck out because it's freezing cold and then because the fact that it's not freezing cold anymore, it releases this burst of these sidechains and this, this feeling of just warmth and power through your body where everything just feels like things are knocked loose. It's almost like a river runs through a clogged up stream and knocks out all the trees and I want to do it man. Oh please. I don't want to take it. I'll take you tomorrow. Want to go tomorrow? I can't do it tomorrow. When can you do it? I got to look at my youtube. Well, we'll talk about it often off screen, but you're going to do the comedy store on Friday. Let's do it before the comments died. Done. That's great. Well, there's one on La Sienna gotta. Do a workout before that too. Is that I will have like, well sometimes I'll actually like to do it after a freeze. They like to freeze first and then work out later, but apparently

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       you can't do that with the ice bath. So they were describing this the other day. Don't listen to me, but this was something that they were talking about. Uh, Ryan, the guy who runs the woodland hills location was telling me that if you was telling somebody else I was eavesdropping that if you do an ice bath, you're done for the day. You don't work out today because you're sitting in that thing for like 20 minutes and it's freezing cold and you know, you know, you're apparently you could fuck yourself up if you work out hard after that. Funny Man. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. You're so fucking cool. I just realized that I realized like I'm sitting talking to a guy and an astronaut suit about going on Friday. Freeze my body. Ice Chamber Bucks.

Speaker 4:          02:52:48       Well listen man, if you can do it, you should do it. It sounds awesome. I would want to say, and even like be the guy that tells people while you're wearing a nasa suit that you need to get a trier agentic chamber for 270 degrees below zero for three minutes. Yeah, you should do that. I'm doing it. I want to do it. We can do these things. Yeah. You have an isolation tank in your house. You can do these things. You have a fucking Mercedes now. You can get these. These things are happen. So weird. The world is weird. So you're selling out all over the country. Ideas broke all the records in Boston this weekend. Oh good. That makes a sold out in advance. Before I even got there. The place was packed. What? Uh, what? Relapse. Boston. Great Room. You've done it. I haven't done it.

Speaker 4:          02:53:31       It's very, it's very good. I haven't done. My Boston is a reemerging comedy scene. We're done with three minutes left. Can I announce the show? I have to.
