Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Let's get home. He Ha what's up dude? What's going on? Come on your shirt. What is that? You've got a lot going on there. We take a penguin with shark teeth. This is my homage to Albert Hoffman in the creation of LSD. Oh Wow. In shirt form. Oh, well that's Hoffman talk with Jesus Christ and then you use all these crazy animal parts for squares and I'm full garden blowing out of his head. Did you know that a road runner can eat a fucking rattlesnake? I didn't, but that's gangster. There's a video of it. Somebody tweeted it to me the other day. I'm like, there's no way this is real, but it's 100% real road runner hunts and killed a fucking rattlesnake and then eats it and it's eating this thing like it's way bigger than it and it's just trying to swallow it. You've no idea how gangster, maybe that's a hard runner.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       Identifies as a pterodactyl. Maybe he does. Check this out. Watch this. First of all, when you really get a good, you look at them from a distance. It a little bird. You're a little, I'm not worried about you, but when you look at them like close up like this and it's high resolution photography, you realize like how fucking predatory these birds are. Like, look that, that the snake takes a lunge at him. He's like, Nah, bitch, not today. Snap gets them right on top of the fucking head. And look how he does it, man. He smashes his head against the rocks, man. Yeah. When people discovered the dinosaurs were probably birds, that's even more terrifying. I a hundred percent believe it. I've told you the story about my chickens, right? With the feed the mice, dude, it's really, the whole thing is really bizarre because it just shows you how like people have these attachments to a certain species for no reason.

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       Like a Steven Nela talks about it with bears. He calls him charismatic Megafauna, but there's something about 60. So eloquent. You know, when he's, uh, he, he's, he's right though. There's like something about bears that make some very different in our eyes, in any other animal and birds, they have these hierarchies. So this hawk flew into my fence. I have a glass fence hog. Didn't know what the fuck is going on. Boomp kod jacked. My daughter's rescue the bird and then they go to the pet store and buy little pinkies, which are these little tiny mice and they feed them to the hawk. So they feed this little tiny mouse had decided the mouse is not as important as the hawk. The Hawk has stay alive. Fuck these little baby mice. So they feed the baby mice to the hockey. It's all of them. But one my daughter went to keep, but I said, you can't keep, it's going to die. It needs, you know, it needs to have milk. I'll just feed it to the chickens. So there's a lot of hemming and hawing and a lot of crying. Everybody wants to the mouse to stay alive. Ft just fed 30 of them to this fucking dinosaur majestic hawk. It's flying monster. And so I bring it into the chicken coop and I mean I put that thing on the ground for not even one half of one second and they were tearing it apart and running around with it. It was their monsters. That rotor thank just confirms

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       that I've to 100% new respect for birds now. Yeah. I think it's, it is interesting how people, but it's, you think about bears, right? And people have love bears since way, way back for like teddy bears. You know, before there was the internet and these different things. There's just certain animals that you have this kinship towards and certain like sacred animals when you're down in the jungle and different places that always seem to inspire something within mankind. Yeah. And I don't know why it is, but I, I think I just sort of accept it now. Like I don't feel the same way about bears. I do about deer. I think deer are wild and they're cool and I love that they exist. But I have a much more predatory feeling around them than I do around bears. Bears are like this weird thing. The, Oh, you can eat them too, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       Yeah. You know, it's just, it doesn't have the same feeling. And as an animal, there's this insane reality of what they are, this enormous like wild dog thing that can kill you. And some of them are just giants, just gigantic wild dog thing. You can kill you and we'd love them. I remember sitting in the, obviously we were out there with the bears, just sitting there in the woods and watching them screw around. It's, it's something different for sure. It's at least in, especially too, when they're kind of looking at you like the connection of looking at the bear and the bear looking at you. I think it's different. Yeah. It's very good. When a deer looks at you, Oh dear, looks at you like, what the fuck? What the fuck are you doing that's inside? And the bear looks at you like, hey man.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       Yeah, that's what doing here. That's what's the different, it's like a different whole thought cycle. I sometimes think of thoughts like the small wheel and the big wheel. It's almost like bears are just on that slightly bigger wheel like us, you know? That's what it is. Right? That's gotta be a big part of what it is. Like we almost inherently recognize that they have a level of understanding that's above the undulates. You know, like there's something about those omnivores. There's like a level, especially them, there's a level of understanding, but at the end of the day, like if you see how they behave, like this is a thing, especially about grizzly bears that I got out of that grizzly man movie is there. There's so almost robotic in their predatory drive and their, their drive to survive. There's survival drive. It just, just moving around looking for stuff to eat all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       Yeah, there are so big, you have to eve teach so much when you're that big. But the advantages, instead of hiding all of the food that you need for the winter, like a squirrel, you ease, eat and eat and eat and nobody's going to take your food from you cause it's just fat on your body. Like the only way to get that fat is the fight the bear. And nobody wants to fight the bear so they can survive the winter a whole different way. It's just a cool way to approach it, but a bizarre way. It's so fascinating when you see all the different methods that nature's figured out to sort of overcome the obstacles that the environment can throw at you. It's animals that

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       can survive. I was in the ocean, uh, recently, we were snorkeling and I'm looking around and all these turtles and all these fish and I'm like, did they live here? They fucking live. I mean I can only stick my head under there for a few seconds. I come up, I got to spray water on the top of the nozzle. They fuck it. There is a living thing surviving in there. It's like life has found a bunch of weird, weird ways to get along and a bear was one of the weirdest ones. Just get fat as fuck. They get big round in Jelly and then he's take a nap. Like fuck this winter. Fuck that. I'm not stupid bro. What am I a moose? I'm going to walk out there and freeze to death like an asshole. I'm just going to sleep like there's the strategy involved in that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       It's so much deeper than the strategy of all the other animals, the other animals. That's the pig. One of the big things with I guess a deer cause they fucking freeze to death, man. That's how they went up dying. Yeah. I wonder, you wonder as that evolves that whole hibernation pattern. If they're just like taking a little naps first when that's the fellow and then f one bear like sleeps two weeks and all the other bears. It's like, what the fuck? That was awesome and it just sleep a little bit longer all the time. How the fuck does that take place? This is one of those really dumb, like people who don't believe in evolution. Art are arguments. You're telling me, you're telling me that's not by design. Come on dude, because somebody who's posted a video, some guy posted a video, like an animated Gif file of the flat.

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       He was a flat earth guy and it was just the earth, like a flat plane there. It wasn't even high resolution. It was like low resolution. It was flat and he's like, show me again the curvature. I'm like, oh my God dude, this is, people are fucking crazy. Yeah. Well, I think that whole people just want to get a leg up, you know, and everything you're doing, you're just trying to edge someone out. So if you can believe in flat earth and it actually is flatter, you got a little bit of leg up on everybody else's shit. The Globe, right? So they're willing to take that gambit. They're willing to place that place that bet. Like fuck it man, I'm going in. I'm flat earth. Cause if I'm right and I can say fuck you to everybody else just a little bit. That's the ego.

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       That is the ego I have to do is watch a couple youtube videos. You'd be convinced if you don't do anything else other than that, like that's the thing. It's like Jordan Peterson talking about how we could all become a Nazi guard. Like we can all believe in flat earth if we just stretched our mind a little bit and then a little bit more, I mean maybe all is the wrong word for Nazi guard or flat earth, but I think they could get a lot of us that you could get. A lot of us. I've told you the story about those fucking rod things that I thought were real. I thought there was rods. You ever heard her? Roswell rods, those little w they're supposed to be insects that are flying through the sky so fast. You can't even see him. And the only way to pick them

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       up with his video cameras and only way to actually see them. So they would find them on these videos like, oh my God, what did you even notice this a time? And uh, they decided that there was these gigantic things that could be, you know, who knows how many feet long and they're like jellyfish and they fly through the air like fucking lightspeed. Yeah, it's those stupid, it turns out what it was is just an artifact when you film things, when you film things with Shitty old cameras and when they have new cameras, he, that's the Rod. See that thing. It looks like a twig. That's what they look like. And some of them you see like way up in the sky. Some of them. It's just a bug that's flying so fast that the camera can pick it up. Right. So the camera makes it look like that.

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       Like that last one, Jamie. Yeah, look at that. See how it looks like. It's almost like a jellyfish. We've been through the air. It's just a video art or like a Bat with a vapor trail for me. Yeah it does. That's that one. Yeah. Cause that one's in front of the tree, but sometimes you see them in the sky so you don't have a outside of reference. Yeah. You know you don't have like, that one's interesting because it's in front of the tree. Like the trees just only, you know, a few yards away you can tell. And if that rod things right in from the tree, you can get a guesstimate on how big it is. But a lot of the videos of them, they had them in the sky, you know, just flying in the sky for, I feel like it's 16 feet long. It's flying.

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       The speed of light. I was in Sedona just having lunch and I was in Sedona is a place where there's some cool shit and then there's a lot of wacky new age shit there. And I was listening to this guy just talk about orbs, right? Like these orbs and he was able to capture, I've seen those on film and I've had orbs in photos and stuff. All it is, it's like the, it's the lens flare effect that creates like, I'm not like super into the science of it, but I know that I can reproduce it if I create a lens flare and the thing, there's going to be an orb somewhere in the picture. Right, right. So, but the way they were describing it, it's like this one, if you go out it at the right time at dawn in this special place, there'll be orbs on the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       It's like where they gather. I'm like, no bitch, it's the sun come out. And every time it creates a lens flare and your camera, you know it's, I would love it if it was that though. Why is such a party pooper? Plenty of be amazing if like you could find balls of light through your round you like little like organisms are lifeforms and like if you were more loving, they surround you do and you just had to take a picture of people and tell whether or not, oh my God, it's studes awesome. Like the seeds from a Wa just kind of like zone. They were all just floating all around. I would deal with that feeling that way to see it was a camera, right? Yeah. I'll tell you man, Eddie Bravo had one picture was it was Eddie Bravo, a bunch of orbs around them and he had his hands open like this and the biggest orb was in his hands.

Speaker 2:          00:11:39       And I said, damn, imagine if we're all, just imagine if we're all just super skeptical and we're ignoring something, I'm going to say fucking real. Oh, it's just a camera auto fact. It's reproducible. You can go back. I sure. Well that's, I mean it's kind of like once you've done enough Iowasca and done enough dmt though, then you open yourself up to the possibility that there are things potentially outside of our ability to perceive them. That's Eddie, right? They're like, look, it's like he's holding it. It's like you got high enough to see it before I have his girlfriend spitting on the camera, trying to get some more herbs. Gulen, like could you recreate orbs? It's spit, but look, if you were going to believe in orbs, that would be, I mean shit, that would, that'd be the one that I'd go with whole. Sure.

Speaker 2:          00:12:30       He's got to know his hand can see it. It's clearly a balancing his center, his love. It would be the shit if it was real. It's like all these things would be the shit. If they were real, like there's some ufo videos over Turkey and I saw it. I didn't even click. I you even click on it. That's how blahzay have gotten about the UFO or deal. I don't because I don't believe you anymore. I'm not clicking on it. Yeah, I would love it if it was real. Wow. That's the weird thing about real, right? You know, it's like when you go see something was such a vivid imagination, like especially in like the psychedelic space, you see something and then there's that debate, like is that real? Right. And then if enough people, like if enough people have seen it or not, people believe in it.

Speaker 2:          00:13:12       Like dragons for example. Like are they real or not? Well, they're clearly not in three d space, but everybody knows and has emotional reactions to this one being and they come to you envision. And so what is that? Is The dragon real? What? What? What's your definition of real? You know, like, is it the collection of an idea in your brain? All of the lights gathering around that you can share and reproduce. And then that thing comes through like an archetype in your brain. Like it's the archetypes. There's so many of them, right? There's the Chinese Dragon, the Japanese Dragon, the Gothic Dragon. No, those, the Medieval Look Dragon. How many different ones are there feeling? Dragons videos, infinite dragons, slightly slight variations on the dragons. That's, that's the thing. It's like it's, it is an archetype of being, I've seen them, they've come to me many, many times always. And it seems to be there, the being of ultimate power, like a being of supreme power.

Speaker 2:          00:14:07       And that's the archetype that it recommends. There's no animal in the animal. A hierarchy that trumps the dragon. And he shows up. Everybody shut the fuck. Exactly. He comes flying in with fire coming out of his face. Everybody just settles down this giant flying Lizard. A con blow fire. Yeah. So it represents that kind of power. My Tattoo artist actually got a cool thing. It's like I never tattoo a dragon snarling because no dragon would ever need to snarl. Like there's nothing he would point, there was nothing, a dragon, whatever, roar at kind of a snarling, you know, cause it is that being of fucking supreme power. It's a strange thing that there's so many different cultures that have sort of captured that. And you've got to wonder

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       how many different things when we missing from the fossil record, you know, and we know of birds exist, who knows how many things existed that we just haven't found yet. It's entirely possible that some weird fucking lizard existed at some part of the world and people could say it, you know, some weird snake thing that walked and then the legend spread of that. And then people saw a bunch of different giant lizards. Like if you saw a Komodo Dragon, if you were just wander through the jungle and you saw a full size Komodo dragon and had its mouth open, you would for sure. Thank you. In the presence of a demon. If you ran away from that, right, no cameras, right? No cameras. Got To take things from your imagination and drawing for people. What are you going to draw? You're gonna draw goddamn demon hissing giant lizard with saliva coated in botulism.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       Those are horrible monsters, man. Those are fucking ruthless, ruthless predatory lizards. Giant lizards. And you would draw them. They would be, they would be, you know, have wings. I mean if you are just a primitive person, you ran into one of those things. If she ran into a Nile Crocodile, Jesus Christ, I put a video up, a one Jack and it vulture does he that shit. This vulture fucked up and got too close to this lake. They Jack everything except for the hippo. Don't see the crocodiles Jack in the Hipaa. No, they still clean. They stay clean. Look how he gets him. Look at this. He's just boomed bitch. Just out of nowhere, get the fuck at Uhmm. Gimme that chicken just jumps right back in there with them. Oh, right under the water. What a what a creepy animal. Lives in this place where you can't see it at all. It's Brown water, fucking brown water and they can hide in three feet of that shit for like hours. They don't have to come up and they just hear the vibrations. They know where you are and they just jump up and chat to you.

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       I think so much of the way that we developed was to try and avoid that situation. Fuck our soft bodies. You know all of this brain activity that we have so much of it you after credit towards avoiding that exact fucking monster. Yeah, well hence the like the stereotypes that the stronger the person dumb or the person, you know like if you have time to make all that muscle bitch, you ain't got time to read any books. You're not. You know, I learn and what that soft dude over there, he's going to save us. That's, he's over there doing physics and shit trying to figure out how to make swords. Your bench press will not help the asteroid collision. That's going to be a big one. That was the creepiest podcast we did last week for sure. Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson freaked me the fuck out again. It's too easy to not think. It's too easy to just not think about the variables. Too easy to not pay attention to the fact that we really are just a species. It's clinging to a spaceship without a roof that were just clinging to this circular orb as it a thousand miles

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       an hour and hurls through infinity or we were just hanging out on it and we don't want, we don't want to think about it. It's due grazie. Yeah. The depressing part of that whole cataclysmic particularly is we're, we got all these fucking nuclear reactors everywhere, so like one goes off and then those things get all disrupted and then the nuclear radiation is the big issue that you have to worry about. Right. Do you see what they did to Chernobyl? They created a dome that's two football fields long. It's gigantic and they're getting case the entire enclosure plus the astro realm of led on that. Yeah. That's what it looks like. It's huge. It's crazy. It's a crazy engineering undertaking. If you look at it and go, what? Like you just have to imagine like what kind of resources and how many brains were involved. Look at this thing.

Speaker 2:          00:18:39       They're going to lift this fucking thing over the dome is this enormous. They have these designs for it. They show the fully competed thing fully completed. What does it say there? 30 countries are involved in this. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I mean, the key is we've got to elevate consciousness to a point where we're actually looking at these situations and being able, and I think that's the point that Graham and Randall make. And I couldn't agree more. Like people have to be at a, at a level where we can actually do something about that instead of fighting with each other. You're 100% right. Look at that image. That's what it's going to look like. They're just going to drop that down over the site. Like Jesus Christ. That's big and so big. That's so crazy how big it is. Look how thick it is. That's insane. I mean, what are the, what the fuck does that way? And the weird part, it's, it just feels to me that it's not fully going to work. Just like putting, like, putting like a tupperware over a Fart, you know? Like, are you going to get the whole part in the tupperware? I doubt it. I think the farts out there, uh, Shane Smith went down there and uh, he was in trouble and they were, they were hunting these wolves. There's these radioactive wolves episode.

Speaker 2:          00:19:56       I was like, what are you talking about? He's like, all these animals that live around that area, they're all radioactive. Like, oh my God, it just hulks out and turns green. Well, they probably are experiencing some mutations. There was some viral video that was going around the Internet that was saying that these are fish that lived near Chernobyl and it showed these just enormous, crazy fish slopping around this little river and they were there. That was the vial. But apparently it's bullshit. Apparently they're just giant catfish or something like that that just do exist in some spot. They're not radioactive. That is deep in our psyche though. That idea that radioactive matter is going to turn something into some amorphous new thing. Yeah. And it's always, it's always bad. It's, except in comic books, if you're a dude, if you're a dude, it always works out well.

Speaker 2:          00:20:42       He always become spider ran or the hulk or you know, you just got to pick the animal. You go into that radioactive soup with. That's true too. Yeah. Yeah. You got to get a good deal. Like the stretchy guy. What's the guy? The and the avengers, not the vendors. The fantastic four stretching guy. That's a shit fucking superpower. That is shit. Oh, you get to bend. People get to stretch you out like Taffy. I'll fucking, where do I sign up? You got to go in with a road runner for sure. Oh, he's got a guy next to him and it turns into fire. Like what the Fuck I get? I just can. This guy can turn into fire and fly through the fucking hair. All I can do is stretch. That is the most bullshit superpower of all time. He could stretch. He makes his arms go into circles.

Speaker 2:          00:21:29       He could turn them into a figure eight like what? I don't know. I fought with Dawson and street fighter and his stretchy ability was definitely helpful. Does he have stretchy ability? Is pretty fine. He could push both his arms out like that and they go away in front of the shoe and the leg, just straight double Dick Punch and then he's got that, the foot like that, like a long ass front kick, someone out of the sky crowd to say, I can't name any of the characters in street fighter, nor can I tell you what they do. I don't know anything about that. I played that a couple of times. I was like, this is the old man that hit me right in this sweet spot and I couldn't, I couldn't ignore it. I was just at that age, you know where you have all the testosterone brewing but the frustration because we little and you couldn't beat anybody up, right?

Speaker 2:          00:22:09       So you just play something in a video game and then you can beat everybody you up if you're that avatar. I wonder how many fights have been started from street fighter? Like if there was like a running tout. Do you know what I mean? Like Mcdonald's has. How many burgers sold? How many likes fights started by a game of street fighter. Less than Madden for sure. Less than that because I see right playing that and it often ends in fights. Yeah. That should be a whole youtube channel. Like Madden street fights. They should come with some gloves. Dudes love their flip all man. They love, I listened to bill birth podcasts and sometimes he'll go like an hour just talking about football. They fucking told us we couldn't do it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:52       Who told you? Yeah, us as the US is the funny thing too cause that's again like the identity playing this trick. It's that that lust for tribalism that we all have. Like we want to be part of a tribe. Oh that team is our tribe and you'll fight for it and you'll feel shitty about it and you'll feel elated about it. I mean it makes the Games interesting but it also opens you up to a weird spectrum of emotion. Yeah. You're that kind of pride for your neighborhood, for your town or your state. All that gets weird. Yeah. Till till you get to America. That's where we crossed the fucking line. Boy. Mirka you better be proud that'd be proud of from here. Donald Trump says he's going to put people in jail for a year if they burned the flag. Here's what's hilarious. Hillary Clinton proposed this in 2005 I didn't know that somebody tweeted that to me on twitter. I think they're having an affair. They probably been out the whole time.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       I feel like either way we win. Yeah. That's what's been going on. All those little shitty little caddy remarks. Yup. What lovers say to each other. That's exactly right. When they get nasty with each other and then them taking me you fucking deplorable. Deplorable basket, but a bucketed deplorables. What was it and people, it was, people just jumped on it. They've been the worst at like creating like memes and stuff and like the worst at coming up. They were the worst that like coming up with a campaign. Thoughts, you know? There was just too, too many things going on with that election where it was just like, wow, you guys are not not that good at this. Like this. I'm with her. Don't say I'm with her. Don't say that's Jesus Christ. How obvious we making it. It were just voting for a check. Like how obvious. Well it's more than that. It's more than that

Speaker 3:          00:24:41       man. This everything is getting squirrely and I think one of the most brilliant parts of Jordan Peterson's podcast yesterday was that he identified in his mind and I tend to agree with them that one of the reasons why things are getting so squirrely as we've removed the metaphysical underpinnings behind our understandings of everything you know and so like all of this social justice and all these pronouns, I think a lot of that is that we've removed the metaphysical understanding of self. You know and so if you really don't understand who yourself is, then you really can't have self love, self worth, self confidence because it's all built on something else and that surrogate for self that they create his identity, who you are, what Pronoun you are, what you know, what tribe you identify with, what you do, what your race is. And then all of these parts of identity, which really have absolutely nothing to do with self in the metaphysical sense become the thing that you defend. You defend that thing as if it is yourself. But it's not. And I think that's, you know, one of the paths that I've taken is to understand those metaphysical underpinnings. I understand what the self is rather than just trying to work on self worth and self confidence and self love. But you got to fucking first understand the cell.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       He was a deep dude, Ben, that the stuff that he was saying about religion, about the need for this understanding of good and evil and then how it plays out and to just stay on that balance of good and evil and to, to live. You know what he was talking about a true life, really fascinating because it was one of those things where he's, he's thinking at an extremely high level. And so when you're following them, you have to be sure you're following him. Like, damn, I'm really getting what he's saying here. You know, cause he's talking about being someone who hates ideologies, but he's a very religious man.

Speaker 3:          00:26:34       I think really the most confusing part of what he was saying was the use of the word religion because it a little bit like Danielle, he and his book create your own religion. He's created

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       his variation of religion that allows him to use that word, you know? But for most people, the colloquial understanding of religion is much, much different. And I think it was confused. I think he would probably benefit from maybe looking at that word and seeing if it's conveying what he actually means. But yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:27:00       I think you're right. But I think I understood what he was saying and I think he definitely understood what he was saying. The problem is, you know, he's, he's looking at it in terms of that these archetypal stories are integral to being human 100% and that they've been a part of our life for so long that this recent jettison that our society has taken away from it. You know, we've sort of launched ourselves away and become more and more cynical about our roots and our understanding of who we are in this world. And like what is important and what is bullshit, you know? And that's all great. I think that's super important and that's, that's what human beings are here for. We're here to be curious. But one of the things that I think people really do really well with his structure and when people don't have a structure, like a reason

Speaker 4:          00:27:49       to behave in a, uh, an ethical and kind way yeah. Or, uh, you know, a better to strive for. They struggle without structure and without truth as the bedrock truth forms the bedrock. And I think that's what he really meant about these religious truth as compared to scientific truths, these, these true understandings that form the bedrock that you can build everything else off of like, again, going back to self, like what is the self? Well, when you look deeper and deeper, it's nothing but you know, the embodied consciousness, the consciousness within us. And then when you understand that your consciousness, then you can ditch all of these other things that you're trying to pile on top of and make it so important, like all of these identity things. But you have to get to at least where my metaphysical understanding is that the self is consciousness embodied in this awesome meet vehicle we get to play around with and experience life and interact with each other and tastes things and fight things and fuck things like it's amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:28:46       But ultimately, you know, we're just that that spark of consciousness. Yeah. Who the fuck knows. Yeah. But what he was saying was cool cause we'll do what he was saying it was when Peterson was talking about it, it was this different level of understanding I think. And he's so incredibly well read. No doubt. I really liked what he was saying too about you know how and one of the, one of the metaphysical understandings that I have it, I mean I think you arrive at it from different ways. I think religion can obviously be a great vehicle to help you arrive at that. You can do it through philosophy. You can do it through experience. And I've kind of gone mostly through that experience route with a different plant medicines and things. And you arrive at these different truths and that idea that you reconcile the darkness within you, that thing inside yourself that is inherently has all the capacity for evil. That was brought to me and in like in a psychedelic experience where I was going

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       in and I realized that I myself was all the darkness and all the light. I was good and bad, a raid on a spectrum and was capable of doing every good thing in every bad thing. And it was the most horrifying experience I've ever had. Like recognizing that I was all of those things. But the only thing that made it, that decided who I was was choice. And that choice was enough. But you had to first reconcile the capability of being everything before you can layer on that element of, all right, I am everything, but I choose to be this. I choose truth. I choose love. I choose to have faith against the fear. And that's, you know, that's ultimately then who you are. But going down into those subterranean depths and realizing that we all have fucked up thoughts. You know, we're all a little bit off here or there and I think it's super important to reconcile.

Speaker 1:          00:30:33       Just like watching that fucking road runner Jack, that snake. We're animals, we're living organisms and we are living organisms that are aware of is crazy. See of genes that we live in is see a fucking sells competing for survival and these weird forms with these weird rules and we're in that. But what we're, as far as we know when the only ones that are aware that we're in it, unless dolphins are aware, they can be aware. If you've ever heard of something called the false killer whale [inaudible] dude, I was in Hawaii this week. We did a little fishing with the kids, had a great time and we're on this boat and this Guy Steve, who was on the boat with me, uh, who was one of the guys working on the boat told me that they had a run in with these false killer whales when they were pulling in these 50 pound tunas and this fucking gigantic 20 foot long thing.

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       That thing ever seen one of those? No. What the fuck dude, how did I not know that that existed? This crazy looking weird whale thing with giant ass teeth and they call them false killer whales. Um, I dunno. I guess it's like some sort of a dolphin subspecies or something. So this a killer whale is too, they're all cousins I guess. But this, this thing snacked this fucking 50 pound tuna right off the hook. Just ripped it off in front of him while he was pulling it in. And so they said, oh Jesus Christ, these things are going to find it. Let's, let's get outta here. We'll go somewhere else. They went five miles away. These fucking things. Follow them. Five miles and Jak, two more fish. Wild, wild, wild world out there. This weekend I had a porpoise steal a tuna from me. We were t catching these little amberjack tuna's, they're not that big like a big one is like 20 pounds is like as big as they get to like most of like 10 pounds, but they're really tasty. Anyway, we're catching these things and I'm pulling them in and he's going crazy. This thing is going crazy and the skipper says there's probably a porpoise chasing yet. I'm like, no fucking way. He's

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       like, yeah, they do it all the time. They grow up going around this. There's this one area where these, uh, these tune is live skipjacks that's what they're called, non amberjack skipjack tuna and this one area where they populate. These fucking dolphins have grown up to know that they can hang around those boats and they wait until someone catches one and then when they fighting fighting, it can't move very quick. So these swim up to it. Well it's on the line and they just jack them and he jacked it right in front of me. Right in front of me. I'm like, no fucking way. And I see this dark shadow underneath the water come near this flashing fish. I had to yank this crazy tug and then the line goes limp. Thanks. Oh, this porpoise. Just Jack that tuna right in front of me. Do that for the Chinook salmon out in British Columbia to yeah, they pull your salmon off the line.

Speaker 2:          00:33:31       They're smart. I mean they figured out that if your line is taught, the fish ain't moving anywhere. It's fighting. It's trying to go this way. The drag and the real. That's like easy one to get. Yeah. And you never hooked those animals to theirs. They're too smart for that. But I said he's hooked him before. Oh, really? Hooked him before. I didn't know that they accidentally had snagged one before. Oh. Like body snag. Like I said, it got bodies like a dolphin. The dolphin will eat your fish to see people. They'll get caught in nets. They just can't see him. But you don't see him get cotton, those hooks. Yeah. They never get, that was one of my bits that you, if people live in the water, you'd catch them all day. Like this difference between dolphins and people. It's like they eat fish but we don't catch them when you go fishing.

Speaker 2:          00:34:09       Like it's Kinda crazy. But the um, the guy said that they had to pull one in some, I forget what the circumstances were but it got foul hooked and they had to pull it in and a release the hook. Yeah. Taking the, be really careful with it. Yeah. Yeah. Going back to what you were saying though about the self being this like collection of cells. I think that's really kind of interesting because the self is so many different cells that are kind of sending competing signals to the brain. All of them trying to almost vie for their own survival and then the brain puts out like a prime directive of what the things that are best for that. But now that we're understanding so much of our gut biome and how much that contributes to the self, it contributes. You know, neurotransmitter production, immune cell production, but every time we shit we drop a bunch of that gut biome into the toilet.

Speaker 2:          00:34:58       I mean it's, it's going to feed on the, on the feces and then we drop it in there. So it's like ourself is changing, you know, every time we take a dump, like that collection of things that we call self, which are some pathogenic organisms, some helpful organisms, some skin cells, all of it's contributing to self. All of it's contributing messages to the brain and it's changing and all the time. And I think that's why people, when they go looking for the self, it's so squirly cause what is the self, I mean it changes every single day. You're a different self when you're angry or happy or mad or in love as when you're inspired or after a workout you're different self. Then when you start, we're just this amalgamation but it's almost an ideology of self to call it one thing and call it, oh this is me.

Speaker 2:          00:35:41       Yeah, we're really, we're just this a lot more nebulous than that. And that's why people get confused and they want to cling to something concrete and ideology self. Here I am. I am. Well you got a v a vague idea of who you are. Yeah. Like you kind of know you know a neighborhood. Ah, I've been down this road. I know that's road, but you know, he could go down a bad road one day, you know, go down to someone towed your car and they weren't supposed to road and you're like, oh I didn't even know this dude.

Speaker 2:          00:36:12       He there's, there's weird parts of you that come out and weird altercations or weird moments of vulnerability and you go, wow, I didn't even know that person was in there. Yeah. Like just looking at, even as much as I think about it, I'll still get stuck and weird self land. Like this past Saturday, I don't know what it was all the Thanksgiving from like noon to 7:00 PM on Saturday, I was a comment. I was the worst. I was the worst. I mean, I didn't even want to hang out with myself. Like, and then at some point like around seven o'clock I was like, oh my God, like what is going on? Will you let, did you eat too much shitty food? Maybe. Yeah. I don't know what it is. I don't want to make excuses. I just, you know, as the my mail menstrual cycle, it was in what way were you like short with people where you just like, I just didn't want to be around.

Speaker 2:          00:37:00       Everything was like such a big deal. Not a big deal, you know like whatever, whatever little thing came up was like a life ending life shattering thing and it was just weird. It's just weird understanding. And then it lifted like a fog. Like just like when the clouds move and the son Pierce through and I was like, what the hell was that? He's like, so that self is a slightly different self then the self that came after it, the self that's here now the self on a cup of coffee versus that. And so I think, you know, it just, we try to oversimplify that when really we're so much more than what we are and there aren't boundaries. This idea that you can contain everything. This is me, this is not me I think really doesn't make a lot of sense, but we filled some techniques to making yourself more positive all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:37:48       Like I think that's one of the things about the Wim Hoff breathing that I really like is that when you, when you do an any kind of breathing exercise, I think any, like even a the beginning of beak from Yoga, when you do that crazy breathing, when you breathe and then your net goes back. I think what, what that really makes you do is concentrate on the moment and it releases excess tension to the point where you have a better ability to be yourself. You know? Totally. I think there's a lot of burdens that we don't recognize that cling to us and we're carrying them around and we don't realize it until we get them free and then we'll go, ah, I just, I needed to go run. You know, like there's some times you just go, I just needed to lift, I need to do something now. Nothing's bothering me. Like this same world exists but 45 minutes or rigorous exercise

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       and he don't give a fuck about it anymore. And this thing that was this overwhelming moment in your life, like it's all a matter of perspective. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:38:46       and the best perspective that I find is when I can tap into that consciousness element, what you can call it, your people call it your higher self, whatever. There's a billion names for it, but it's the best version of yourself. You know, like who you are at your very, very best when you're filled with the most love and the most peace and the most like inner just contentment and satisfaction, like your best self. And then when you can ask, find ways to access that, I think absolutely right. Yoga, breathing, flotation, you know, nature flow state, all of these ways are ways to tap into that best self, which is usually, you know, anchored in the present moment and is you at your very best. And from that vantage point, you see the obstacles laid out in front of you and maybe they don't go away, but maybe you can look at them, you know, as you should like an advantage and opportunity to grow stronger, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:39:37       Yeah. Just perspective. I think their purse, I think all of those things, including marijuana and a lot other psychedelic compounds, their perspective enhancers. Yeah, and I think that's what they're here for. We just, we equate them with the negative aspects of, we know that some drugs have on people, so we know that, you know, sometimes they can be bad, but I feel that same way about religion and I feel that same way about government. I feel that same way about a lot of things, just because certain aspects of it are fucked. It doesn't mean it doesn't have some massive benefits for us. Like even like you could call it like religion. A lot of ways it's like bill cosby. Okay. Is Bill Cosby did some horrible shit, some horrible shit. Most likely. Right. But he made a lot of fucking people laugh. Yeah, right. It's a lot of people.

Speaker 5:          00:40:26       If you looked at the number of victims versus the number of people that benefited from it, hit him. You'd go, wow, what a complex situation that says you have this monster who also is doing amazing work. Yeah. Like he's making people show happy everywhere and he's enforcing this like really positive way of behaving and thinking for people. Like you could never imagine yourself swaying around bill cosby, you know he was this upstanding PhD guy. I think in a lot of ways that's the same way about religion. Like if it wasn't for religion and I'm not an advocate of religion currently, like to use it currently in the same form that everybody's using it, but I'm just saying if you looked at like humankind as a whole, if it wasn't for believing that we had these crazy rules, then we had to do good. Otherwise the dad would come and strike a stat if it wasn't like the fear, literally live literal fear of God that kept people from just raping and pillaging and doing whatever the fuck they wanted to. Who knows how much longer it would have taken us to get to the place where you can fight over gender pronouns. Yeah. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:41:30       It's almost like a system that may at some have been necessary.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       Yeah. We don't know that people, we weren't around people 3000 years ago. We don't know what they would've done without the threat and that fear of God because there was no dna evidence. There was no, you know, inspectors and detective. So maybe it was necessary, but clearly now the dogma that's surrounding it is an impediment to our happiness and impediment to, you know, the, the better truths that are going to hopefully make this world, you know, a more positive place for everybody. Well they, because I think you nailed it when you said like a program because I think that's really what it is. It's almost like a program that human beings sort of manifested to travel to the next stage of development. Like, look, we're just not going to get here to thing and claw. I ain't going to work, boy. Okay. You know, we've got agriculture but we're still behaving like monsters.

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       You know and they had to just figure out things to worship, things to love, things to cherish, things to believe in and the new pass these things down. I was like this higher daddy, this higher daddy thing cause that's what it is, man. The problem is a couple of people got it, saw that, jacked it jacked and then manipulated it for their own power and they want to talk to the gunk. Yeah, exactly. I mean that whole move of all right, you, you can't talk to God to talk to God. You got to come see me and you got to build me a big house and you've got to pay me every year and then I'll translate that message, you know, to the divine on your behalf. Thank you very much. My favorite version of that is you ever see the dude who took pictures of himself in heaven? No. That's awesome. He fucking, he went to heaven pastor. He came back, he had a suit on and a white background, white background and he said he was in heaven. He took photos and he put them up on instagram.

Speaker 2:          00:43:15       The photos. He was selling the photos of him in heaven. Yeah, I come on son. I think in order for that to work for people, you have to break the brain early and I think you break the brain by saying something like fear of God. Oh amazing. I thought it was all white man. Why does it have like a Rainbow Hue to it? Is it the same photo? Hmm. That's weird. I could've sworn I might be another person. No, it's the same guy. It's definitely the same guy. And that's the same photo. But the image looked yes. And that image he, it was, it was white and some of images it was, well I think somebody's added something to that photo. I think they put like the, the sun rays and shit. That's the one. The one, see the one above him with the suit. Not that one right there. That kept going to the second row. Second row. Yeah. There you go. Click on that one. That was the image. It was just him with a white background. He said, Yo, I'm in heaven. Dog. Fucking know Jesus loves you. I'm telling you man, and he was selling these photos. Slick suit though. Suit. What's that? Ruffled shirt? What does it say? What he saw? We'll burn your heart.

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       What? Yeah. I don't know if that would bring your heart. I don't want my heartburn. I think it's green. Your heart is good the way it is. Imagine if there was a heaven and we were just talking shit. Imagine if like one day the space shuttle takes the wrong turn and it's on its way up into orbit and it just pops through this little hole and like, oh shit, we're and have a Dan Heaven and they get out, take their head gear off. They can breathe. His angels hanging around up there. It's like, you know, I think it's just people have made that wrong turn. Like Jordan Peterson was saying of taking these things as literal when they should be metaphysical like we all have the ability to create heaven and hell in our own life, which is a point when we made and then you know when we are pure consciousness what I've experienced at least from from all the psychedelic experiences.

Speaker 4:          00:45:20       When you, when the body disappears and becomes less prominent and you're thinking you are what seemingly just pure consciousness, you know, there's also that opportunity there for heaven to embrace all of the love. And then there's also the opportunity to look back on your life. Like, what the fuck? You know, I really, I made these choices that hurt these people and that is this almost hell, you know, so, so Helen Heaven is again, you know, as above. So below it's just a mental state, you know? And that could be the same, very same mental state that we go across. But instead we tried to make it concrete. We tried to, you know, Salvador Bosh, you know, tried to create all of these horrible things of things biting you and burning you in vis, rating your genitals and prying you apart when all of that is really a metaphor for what's happening in your mind, you know, not an actual place.

Speaker 4:          00:46:10       Yeah. Like the mind of Dick Cheney. Yeah. I kinda his Dick Cheney, go to sleep without pills. You know, what kind of, what kind of dreams does that guy have right now? Woo. And what happens when he's liberated from, you know, from all of the rationalizations. You know, like when, when all of those things is to be like, like, you know, you get in the float tank and you see all these things that have allowed you to think a certain way and then you go floating and then all of those structures go apart and then you look at that thing you did and go, ah, was that cool? Was that Douchey? You know, like you cause it, but he's never had that moment. He's never stopped the hamster wheel long enough to get still to be able to look at his life from his higher self and be like, Whoa, what am I doing?

Speaker 4:          00:46:52       Look at all this momentum. Look at all the software viruses that my open open source consciousness has picked up along the way. These different fears, different greeds, these lust for power, these different things that have created this thing that's never stopped. And the momentum's never gotten quiet enough for them to really analyze it. Do they kept that guy alive with somebody else's heart date? They cut him open and put another dude's heart inside of him. That is fucking crazy to think that human beings can do that. We could fix, they can take out your lungs, man. They can replace your lungs with someone else's lungs. I think that's all helpful to thinking about it because the more we lose that attachment to this body as being like anything but the machine, the machine that's going to allow us to experience consciousness in the physical form. I think when we really look at that, then that's going to be a helpful kind of metaphysical underpinning. So we're not so caught up in these, in these elements that are causing us so much discomfort and suffering. Right. We're not trapped. Yeah. And this idea of what we are. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:48:02       but like isn't it inevitable if they, if they come up with bionic eyes to let you stare at the sun, you could watch netflix on them and they're way better than regular eyes and they give the people who lose their eyes first and then people start going to scoop these fucking Shitty bitches out and give me some of them. Good eyes. And you get them good eyes and he start, I mean everybody has a good eyes. You just walk around and look at each other a wink, you know, you know I got the good eyes. You've got to go. You could see each other, can fucking read sports scores flying in the sky. It's the hardware upgrade. Yeah, upgrade. Have binocular vision. You can decide to zoom in on things far off into the distance. Why wouldn't you do that? What do you like seeing at your shitty old fucking bloodshot eyes?

Speaker 4:          00:48:43       Yeah, bitch ass eyes. The upgrade, the hardware and then we just gotta make sure that we're upgrading the software and eliminating the viruses, wanting those system checks to get all of these bad programs out of our head. Get the better metaphysical truth programs like, like the platinum rule, like you know, you, everybody is you living a different life. Treat him as such, you know, like get some of these other software programs running. Discard the old ones. Then upgrade the hardware all you want and, but both have to kind of come in conjunction. Otherwise we'll do what we did with technology. Elevating faster than consciousness. Technology elevates fast and the consciousness and we just fuck each other up better. Yeah, we definitely do that. I think

Speaker 5:          00:49:24       also technology is just, it's just trying to get us more and more addicted to it. I was thinking of this the other day and I was flying back from Hawaii. I was thinking of how many people I see stare at a phone at the airport, at the fucking mall and a restaurant myself. I'm staring at my own phone. Well, I'm mean, I'm not immune to it. We're all staring at fucking phones and I'm like, if I was a pilgrim, if you took took, you went back in a time machine, he grabbed a pilgrim and you dragged them to 2016 and you said, what are you saying? They'd be like, my God, they're all, they're all prisoners to the looking glass. He'd been captured like do were like, it's like threaten their spouse. They're under her spell. They stare at a fucking glass screen first thing in the morning.

Speaker 5:          00:50:10       They check their email to go to work. They stare at a screen. They look at their navigation system. While they're fucking driving to work. They get home. They watched TV before they go to bed, they check their email again. They're just staring at fucking screens. They're living their lives through screens. I would think to looking glass. It's captivated though. I would think they were under the spell of glass. Like there was something about something bond. They're not moving. They're just sitting there in front of this fucking thing all day. They're almost does almost no movement. Almost all the time you're in front of a screen. You're just sitting there. Yeah. If you saw that and you had no idea what the fuck had television was or a phone, you were just a person from another time period and he said, what do you think's going on?

Speaker 5:          00:50:52       Like with these fucking people are under a spell. They're clearly under a spell. Like it's giving them something. Yeah, but that's what a spell is and mean. The fucking when the the the, the hip dodick dancer dances in front of you and then all of a sudden you don't even know where you are anymore. It's cause you're looking at something cool. It's a strip club. Yeah, exactly. There you go. Know where you are. Yeah. You ate the edible did Joey Diaz gave you, that was mislabeled on purpose. You, this is what you're seeing. You're, you're seeing something amazing and that amazing thing is making you want more of it so you're, you're spending more money to get a better computer to make better explosions on the bigger screen that has the better sound and it keeps going deeper and deeper and every fucking new phone has some new way to get chicks excited and you're staring at the newest and best screen and just locked into this, this sort of hypnotic trance of technology. Oh, it allowable allows you to Bluetooth with your navigation. So stone syncs up to your car and like you're still staring at a fucking screen and not doing anything. It doesn't matter what's happening. The same effect is taking place. You're staring at a screen.

Speaker 4:          00:52:00       I think what's, what's interesting to me is I think we're in this intermediary intermediary stage where we're watching this rapid advancement and things are getting more and more interesting, but I think there's going to be a tipping point where technology is so ubiquitous that will actually, it'll, it'll kind of settled into our lives in a better way and maybe some people will get completely lost, but I think a lot of us are already reaching that point where it's almost too much and it's forcing us to make our own boundaries, put our phone down. You know, this idea of put your phone away on this retreat. There's no phones here. We're starting to develop the counter reaction to it, but it has to get to the point of ridiculous in order for us to do, you know, have this kind of counter reaction. I think that's the way it's going. I think that's like using them. Fred flintstones breaks

Speaker 5:          00:52:46       Formula One car. Good luck. We're going to put our phone away for a whole hour. You know, it's just sitting there and your bag.

Speaker 4:          00:53:03       Only the only hope that I have for that philosophy. How was espousing is I like I learned, I thought it's something at burning man and burning and burning man. There was, it's so much shit like you have no idea. You can't even fathom how many lit up amazingly beautiful fire breathing, art creations, dancing

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       people, half naked people, fully naked people or g tents. This crazy amalgamation. I mean I was in this like thunder dome. They rebuilt the thunderdome basically and they had people on bungee cords and two topless chicks were smashing into each other on bungee cords, beating each other with foam sabres as like house music played behind and a fucking fire breathing dragon car like rode by breathing fire. Like that is ridiculous. Sounds awesome. It's ridiculous. But what after you've been there for a while, like you realize the Times that you enjoy the most are getting high with your homeys in the rv. You know, like that's the absolute best time you have a burning man and those like just laughing and hanging and drinking a beer in the rv. Do you think that's enhanced though by the chaotic environment and the fact you have this crazy feeling like, wow, we're here, we're here.

Speaker 2:          00:54:18       For sure. That's kind of what goes on at a place like that, right? It's like, wow, we're here. Yeah, yeah. All of it contributes. But then just realizing like we can do that rv moment anywhere. Like you don't need to be in burning man. You don't. That is the most special shit. Like the most special shit is the simple shit. So you can take all this technology does all this awesome stuff, but it's never going to be like that hike or that time you're hanging and playing with your kids or that time you went fishing or that time. It's never going to beat that. You know? And you start to realize that when it gets to the ridiculous, it's just when it's on this kind of intermediary level that it's hard for us to figure out, I think. Yeah. Well I think the only way to truly appreciate the natural world, excuse me, to truly appreciate the wonders of the natural world is to, to be engaged in it.

Speaker 2:          00:55:05       Separate of the electronic world, like if you're on some crazy hike but you're also staring at your phone the entire time you're walking, you're just not going to get the whole feet. Like if you, if you're hiking in Yosemite and you know some of those incredible views and vistas and you're traveling around these amazing nature, just like you're not going to really take that in. If you're looking at your phone all the time or thinking about what picture you're going to take. Yeah, yeah. You got a bunch of selfies because you're inherently, there's nothing about the phone that is in the present moment unless something is immediately popping up. Right. It's all about the past. How I look, you know, if the future, how, what am I going to post? What's going to come? So it takes you out of the present moment. I think present moment is really the only pleasurable state that we have on the planet is when your presence, those fucking screens, man and your ego is just preen. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56:03       Look up like 5,000 likes, 5,000 likes. Yeah. You put filters on shit. Get that angle perfect. God get those. It's so seductive though. I mean, even before, even before there was, you know, these phones and selfies, there was paintings and then there is just your appearance in general. So people would get seduced by the, you know, their reflection in the mirror and looking pretty good, you know, and then all the way back, maybe even before there was mirrors, there was that time in the brook and that's where you get that, uh, the myth of narcissus who just couldn't stop looking at his reflection in the, in the waters of the Stream, you know? And that was like the original point of you start looking at yourself, not ad sells. Separating yourself from self. You'll never be in the present moment. You'll always be looking at yourself, judging yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:56:51       And that's a game you can never fucking win. You're not gonna win that one bitch. W W how much do you think it costs back in the day to get your portrait painted? Like if you got your portrait painted back in the Hellenic Saul's, you are a bad motherfucker, right? You had some cash, man, you gotta, you sat there and looked regal with your best clothes while some dude just painted you for how long? How long does it take? Well, they would pose for marbled busts back even before then. Like you go back to the Roman and Greek Times. That's insane. That's insane how long that takes three to get carved in marble. Yeah, that's insane. And you can't move. But the ego is so seductive. You know, you want that. You want to portray that image and it, the problem is it's just always so vulnerable. Like it never feels confident no matter how wealthy you are, how good looking you are.

Speaker 2:          00:57:42       It's always unshaking ground because it's all nonsense. You know, your consciousness. And that's enough. Like you don't need to be all of these things. But you do though. If you're that guy, he'd be that guy that sits there for the bust. I mean, that's one of the things I was thinking when I was in Rome and I was going through the Vatican, uh, we were looking at all these different sculptures of like that there's no way everyone was jacked. Like everyone was jacked. Everyone, everyone. Everyone had a six pack. It's so polite how they made everybody with a small dicks and nobody felt like, you know why they did that? So nobody felt like it was just, no, no, no, no. It's interestingly enough, I asked of course, and uh, the, the guy told me that in the Roman age it was considered a barbaric.

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       If you had a big penis like you, you weren't a person of culture or thought if you had a big penis. And whether he's correct or not, I'm not sure Jamie looked that up. Please. But that's interesting that like these little Dick dudes and say, listen, this big Dick thing, it's a fad. Okay. Don't get attached to it. There were all brutes and assholes. That's why we're in this mess in the first place. It's all those big Dick assholes. You want a solid, a solid Roman Catholic government. You needed a little dick dude with a six pack, just jacked. The tits looks like GSP with a leaf over his death. The leaves were a lot of leads or put over the Dick's later. And a lot of the leaves, uh, the, that like style of the leaf over the deck posts, Constantine. Yeah. It happened later after some religious period, they just decided to stop looking at Dick's. They just like, what? This has been in front of us the whole time. Oh my goodness.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       That's, I mean, it's, it's really, uh, like that classic example of let's make something that we're not, yeah, let's make that bad. You know, that thing is bad. So we don't have a big Dick. But I mean, I think there were also the honest inclination that guy's got a hog and a half though the devil. He's the devil. Yeah. The demons always had giant dicks. You don't want that girl, that big Dick Demon Monster. Um, yeah. That guy's got a hog. Put it away, Jamie. Kind of looking at it. It's, um, it's, it's, it's just weird to think that they were struggling between like, I guess a big Dick represented virility, which represented conquest, which represented war, which represents a strife, like all those big Dick dudes just coming over the mountains. Fucking big shaggy beards, swinging swords and shit. Brennan. The Gall, we gotta stop this fighting himself and yelling and his bear skins on mushrooms as he's looking at a line of impenetrable shield.

Speaker 1:          01:00:23       That guy, that guy. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want that guy and his giant Dick that thought we had a hawk or sure. Just hair braided around like says Les Pauls. Yeah. I mean if a girl tried to suck his dick literally sucking on one of those cat posts, it's just say Harry Dick Harry. Like, look what you imagine a Buffalo Dick would be like, oh, he's just random hairs hanging off of the shaft of his Dick. Just dreadlock barbarian Dick. He probably comes up a bright white, bright white light toothpaste. Just raw is the moonlight and glow boom. Shoots out. Looks like bones, like liquid bones from out of his dick. You could, you can't have that guy around his milk deck. You need a little dudes with six packs that look like they could go gay at any moment in time. Cause they did. Yeah. Every one of them was just ready to suck a cock and conveniently the dicks were small, so nobody gagged if that's what was going on too.

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       There was a lot of Dick Sucking back then the guys who made, it's just a friendly little dick. You know, they didn't have those barbarian dicks deal with wonder when they realize you shouldn't fuck dudes all the time when when they realized when they were, when he, she's like, because people who essentially weren't even gay, we're fucking dude's right. Not there's anything wrong with being gay. Let's just get that out of the way. I'm not judging in any way homosexuality, but I'm saying that it's, it's uh, less likely than being straight. But back then that was on the case. Yeah. Whether you were an actual gay person or not, that's the question. Were they gay people? There are more gay people where they're more bisexual people or was everybody greedy? I think it's, I think it's a combination. I think we're naturally a lot more bisexual then we act on because we're, everybody's also naturally quite a bit

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       and that's, that's part of it. But I also think they were fucking kids back then. And it was like there was like the momentum of fucking kids. Like if you're a kid and you get fucked by a dude, like I think there's gotta be a correlation there between, you know, having the desire to do the same thing. It's just like if your dad beats you, then you want to, you know, beat when you're a dad. It's this the same kind of an ingrained thing. And I think they just got this momentum of kid fucking, and then that probably contributed along with there's the open mindedness and not being homophobic. Actually they, they sometimes are homophobic against the people who would receive the Dick, but the people who were supplying the Dick, it was like prison. It's kind of like prison basically. Like the whole society was prison, you know, cause if you're, if you're the pitcher you're not really, you know, it's Kinda normal.

Speaker 2:          01:03:05       Everybody's a picture. Yeah. You just show the character of the loads, you know? And, and that was like one thing, if you look at some of the graffiti when Cesar was taking over power, like some of the group for graffiti was calling him like the catcher. Oh like Cesar, you catch her, you know, whatever, whatever word that was for that, you know, cause that was still a slight like you were supposed to at at the most virile. If you're head of the Roman legions, you know, you want to be the pitcher. When I was in high school and my friend Jimmy lawless I'm still friends with today, I love that dude. But Jimmy Wallace was, what a great name by the way. It's right up there with Eddie Bravo. But he, uh, w we knew this dude who was bisexual and we were kind of weirded out because we were, you know, I think I was 17 and Jimmy was 18. And you're like, what the fuck? Like what do you think? What does that mean? Like, uh, cause he, you know, he goes, I don't know if I believe in bisexuals. I think they're just greedy.

Speaker 2:          01:03:57       He started laughing. He started laughing so hard cause he was only like half serious but cause I think they're just greedy. I'll never forget it. It's like so burned in my head as a 17 year old that laughed at everything. You know, I had a 17 year olds, ridiculously stupid sense of humor. And to this day if someone says bisexual, I just think of him going, well is this, I mean humans have put their Dick and everything. Anything, anything, whatever. Who's these couches for? Cheap flashlights, people, men, women, whatever. How we met. Yeah. Well I think we should clarify. Aubrey and I met when he worked for the flush, right. If you didn't know that I'll be working for a company that, a fake vagina. You have sexual gelatinous fake. It was like man, if something form with gelatin or something, food, chores. Gelatin can't divulge family secrets.

Speaker 2:          01:04:51       But uh, um, it's a, that's how we met Pete. People love to just get rid of com and makes you feel better. And I think we got to just remove all of the fucking stigma about it. Like, I know it's just, it's the come release mechanism for the pleasure monkey and that was actually like that. That word was something that came to me actually my Wasco trip. But that's what we fucking are. Where pleasure monkeys. Like we're here to soak in as much pleasure, laughter, feel all the things that you can fucking feel to your

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       body. Hit all of the pleasure buttons. Like why would you have a pleasure button and not push it? It doesn't make any sense. Like push all of your pleasure buttons. Let's feel what that feels like. Let's go through and finish this existence in the material form saying like, man, there was like, you don't want to have that button. You're like, man, I heard that button was awesome, but I just never pushed it because I was afraid and it was a religion said this thing and blah blah blah, like fucking pushed the pleasure buttons. Like let's look shit. Yeah, you know, recognize that that's what we're here for. And stop. Stop stressing so much about it. Like the idea that you should be guilty for your pleasure. Like you don't deserve it. Like you do. We still have the echoes of the puritans that landed here and sort of tried to reestablish

Speaker 5:          01:05:59       mean w w what's really similar to a lot of other crazy religious ideologies, views on sex, like really rigid restrictive sex practices, you know, and that stuff's stuck. It's hard to shake that shit off. It's hard to be grown adults like you are with your friends, you know, like you are with your friends, you talk about sex, you know, it's just sex. It's, it's what people do. It feels, you don't say, oh, she wants sex, that dirty, dirty demon possessed woman going to go, yeah, look at her. She's hot, but she wants to Dick all day. Hot Girls. Like that's probably like what's going on when you look at Jennifer Lopez, his ass, like that's, that's the ass of a woman that probably enjoys a dick. Right. You'd hope so dude up. So it seems like there's some system there, right? It attracts them. She probably likes them.

Speaker 5:          01:06:45       It's like a flower and the, the bees land on it and the flower wants to be. Exactly. It's mutually the more fragrant the flower, the more it just desiring mutually beneficial relationship. But somewhere along the line people decided to restrict it and they've really clamped down. I and I think it was during the hard times and I think it's just so much, there's so much to the restriction on sex that I think also has to do with our worrying about people not being able to handle hard times if they come again, like there's a lot of people I think in this world with the preppers, whether people that are just concerned about the future of the world, they're really worried that people are losing could. And ironically it's funny because the people that would be more restrictive when it comes to sex and usually the right wingers, but the right wingers are least concerned about environmental damage.

Speaker 5:          01:07:32       They're more concerned about fiscal profits like currently and then the left wing would be much more concerned with environmental but much less restrictive when it comes to sexuality. Like the, the idea that you could just run around having sex with whoever you want and just experiencing pleasure and not committing to people. And having a good time and smoking a little pot and drinking and dancing and just enjoying life. That's not good for commerce, right? That's not good for business. That's not good. And so if you want people to embrace the same sort of level of materialism that you're going to need to make your bottom line go up every year, you've got to stop these fucking hippies and their goddamn fucking dance out in the desert. Sure. So he

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       burning down the bullshit out there, cutting back on our profits. You got to look at that motivation. And you've also got to look at the motivation of, of just control. You know, like you take something that someone is going to think about all the fucking time, all the time, and then make him guilty for that and make it as sin and make you the one who can absolve them of that sin. You got him fucking locked like every single human on planet earth is going to sin and they're going to need you to rescue them from hell. Fire. Boom. It's like the ultimate fucking rear naked choke on the human psyche, right? Because no one's going to be able to stop themselves from having sexual urges and thoughts. And if your thoughts are a sin and you're the only one who can take it away from its fucking the world's greatest con, the world's greatest con might be making prostitution illegal, right?

Speaker 2:          01:09:06       Like how do they figure out a way you can fuck anybody you want for free? Like there's, it's not like it's illegal to fuck. It's not like murder, you know, like you just can't go around killing people. I don't care how much you pay, you can't go kill people. That's not what we do. Okay, we're civilized. But you could just go get some coke, go to a bar, started doing shots of people. Next thing you know, you're banging people. You put beverly, even know them, right? If you're some fucking wild person, you could just, if you're a girl, especially God damn, you could travel from place to place to place and give it away and just get dick every anywhere you want. Right? Well that is okay. But if you go there and you actually exchange pieces of paper or coins, that's not good, or bitcoins, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          01:09:49       Like how is that possible? Pick coin prostitute. That's high level. I'm more interested at high level. If I can pay for very high level and pay for my sex act with a bitcoin really smart girl too, they show up. They just see things differently. I just think this is saying that you could pay people for massages, you could pay people to do your nails, you can get pedicures and manicures and you could have people do all sorts of stuff. Do you wax you and just don't massage your Dick? It's, it's crazy and I, you know, honestly I think it's, it's this special distinction that that religion has given him the other, some consequences of sex. There's potential pregnancy, but we've mostly eradicated that. If you're really trying, at least if you're trying, you can eradicate that, that issue in there. Some, there's some diseases, so there's some consequences.

Speaker 2:          01:10:36       I get it. I get, it's a little different than a massage where you're less likely to get, you know anything of where it's a condom. You filthy animal, it's almost zero disease problems, but the amount of, the amount of difference that people give that to like, like you imagine your girl getting massage from a dude. You're like, okay, but then he massages her vagina. Oh man, the stomach, the stomach feel funny and you want to Puke and you want to fight them and you want to stab him in the throat for touching your girl and you just think how wet she probably was. She couldn't believe how naughty this was. She's probably leaking down the side of her legs. Oh my gosh. By came immediately. As soon as he,

Speaker 1:          01:11:13       his thumb just gently rubbed up against her assholes. Jill toes spread out under feet, cramped up, Jesus and everybody felt so naughty, naughty, naughty, naughty, terrible person, terrible rule breaker violator later of the trust.

Speaker 4:          01:11:35       It's so crazy, man. We just got it all. We just got it all, look at each other and be like, we're all just fucking pleasure monkeys. It's cool where you get your pleasure. I'm not your pleasure dealer. You know, let's love each other and just

Speaker 1:          01:11:46       be cool. Yeah, it's going to take a little while. They can't close to that in the 60s for awhile. You know what I mean? You think about the difference between the fifties in the 60s I think about like the people in the 50s were all like locked down watching Hawaii five o and shit. Well actually that was probably the 60s dragnet. That's what I was trying to think of. Did you ever see the dragnet thing drag net Guy Joe Friday? It was talking to some fucking Hippie, some God damn hippie and he's explaining to the Hippie uh, how easy they have it and how, how lucky they should they feel living in America today. What all the people that have sacrificed so much to allow them to dress like silly people. And it's so hilarious cause it sounds like a person to this. Is it like listen to this is fat and I'm selfish and you the first generation to come along with felt dissatisfied.

Speaker 1:          01:12:31       They all have, you know about different things. And most of them didn't have the same opportunity in the freedoms that you do. Let's talk poverty. Most places in the world, that's not a problem. It's a way of life and rights. They're to give you a blank stare because they may not know what you're talking about. The fact is more people are living better right here than anywhere else ever before in history is I don't expect us to roll over and play dead. When you say you're dissatisfied, it's not perfect, but it's a great deal better than when we grew up a hundred men standing on the stoop, Peckham, Joe Friday's in a purple fucking strictly and tars talking down to look like they're the dudes in the back of the Jimi Hendrix pan that nobody can tell you their name. I mean there's like Jimi Hendrix and the dudes he was with and I'm sure if you're fucking heavy duty music had, you're mad at me right now. I understand, but no, this giant Jimi Hendrix Fan, obviously giant. I don't know who the fuck he toured with. I don't know who those dudes were. I have no idea.

Speaker 4:          01:13:29       People when they see other people having fun and they don't feel like they can get there, they want to shit on it. Yeah. That's like, that's like these got looking at having all this sex get an eye, they look happy as shit. Like that's going to, cause it's that resistance towards towards joining it that if the actually just relaxed and, and did it, they'd probably feel good but they can't somehow they feel like they can or they shouldn't and they won't. So the reaction is to remove that thing to squash that thing to make it more like them so that it feels so they don't have that, you know, those eyes that are looking over there saying, oh, maybe that life's better and what's wrong with me? How come I can't do that? You know, so people shit on it.

Speaker 1:          01:14:03       I think the lines are being blurred though between like uh, really like hardcore no nonsense people like a Joe Friday type character and the hippies, those lines are getting like, there's a lot of people that like go in weird slots. Like how'd that guy get in that? Oh, he's in a weird spot. Like he's kind of both of those things. There's a lot of those people now that you can't really lock them down. He can't say this is a right wing person or a left wing person is a no nonsense discipline. Get to work person. And this is a pothead and this is a guy likes to do mushrooms and this is a guy who gets up in the morning and runs. They might be the same dude now. Like there's a lot of like crossover between people who are like very disciplined hard workers but also experience pleasure and also understand that this is, we are a temporary life form hurling through infinity.

Speaker 1:          01:14:52       Wake the fuck up and just have fun and enjoy this because this is madness. And it could very well be over at the blink of an eye, a fucking giant rock. The size of Pittsburgh can come flying out of the north and no one catches it until it's too late and it slams into the fucking polar ice cap. And we're diggity diggity done. We're done. That's it. It's a wrap. There's like 50 of us left. We eat each other, you know, we turned into mice. The only thing, the only thing that we're, that's keeping us from engaging in all of these other forms that we went to is this clinging to identity and these and these fear programs. We like, we ditch all that then then you just get wide open for everything else. And it's not a new idea like the idea of the warrior poet, the idea back then if someone who could go to battle and like Musashi who could be the best swordsman and also be the best calligrapher and also a writer and also meditate and also, you know, have affairs and also do whatever like passionate love affair, all of the things like at a certain point people realize like, oh yeah, all the things is best.

Speaker 1:          01:15:55       And then at a certain point now in our culture, or at least getting to here, it was like you have to identify with this one thing and that's your thing. And then you defend that thing and, and Nah, man, chuck and enjoy all of it. Well, what I realized from Musashi when I was, um, I think I was in my teens when I read the book of five rings the first time, what I realized is that he was explaining this concept that was totally alien to me at the time as like an insecure teenager. He was explaining this concept of to be balanced at anything, to be like at your best, at anything, you have to have no loose ends. You have to be loving, you have to be kind, you have to be an artist, you have to be creative. But you also have to be ruthless with your sword technique. And you have to be ruthless with your psychology and how you engage with your enemy and you, I mean, he was a fascinating, fascinating guy. He got bored fighting people with swords. So he stopped, he started using oars from boats. You start fucking people up with oars. He's like, I'm just tired of fucking these bitches up with swords. He killed 62 people and one on one combat with weapons. Wow. And along the way he developed this really

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       intense, very rigid sort of guideline for maintaining the ultimate warrior spirit. And that was a balanced perspective. It was really weird because I remember reading about that at the time and I thought he just had to be a killer man. I thought you had to be, you know, you had to be like Roberto Duran when he was young. You had to be just a savage. Like that was the only way to be a good fighter. He had to be a savage. It'd be just someone who just came in, just guns blazing, didn't give a fuck. Like Mike Tyson, the early days, there was the only way to be successful. That's what I thought. And what he was saying is, no, you have to be a master of yourself. Yup. The master of all aspects of yourself. And there's no, there's no more terrifying form of combat than one on one with a fucking sword. I mean, he was the master. He was the guy that figured it out in a very strange time in Japanese history where he was a Ronin just traveling around fucking killing people. Yeah. I think,

Speaker 4:          01:18:05       I think some of these times when you look back some of the philosophies that developed her or even more advanced than ours, because when you have a strong external pressure, like the, like the likelihood of a sword battle to the death. Yeah. That forms this point of resistance where you got to cut out a lot of the bullshit, all the bullshit. Like you really have to look at the world in a different way. And even when there was the threat of, of fighting somebody at any point, you know, that changes how you are as a man, like that chain. That's an external point of resistance that causes you to understand certain things about, about the nature of life and the nature of your manhood. Whereas now we have so little external pressure like most of us can go through life and never get in a fight.

Speaker 4:          01:18:48       You know, that's not something that it's in a lot of people's lives still in some people's lives. For sure, but like you're removed from these different things and, and sports offer that and kind of a very controlled way, but you take away all of these external pressures and then you get read. It gets really squirly because you have nothing to define yourself against. You don't have any resistance. You're like lifting weights on the moon and no matter what you try to do, you can't get a fucking squat right, because there's no gravity. You know what I mean? Like, and so you have to, you have to go out and I think actively put yourself in situations that are going to challenge you, going to test you. And it doesn't all have to be physical. That's just one way in. Find yourself in challenging mental situations. Find yourself in challenging emotional situations, emotionally challenging physical situation, pulling crazy relationships. Do they started fights, right? They put, they build up challenging emotional situations who they can escape them. They make their own obstacle course to get through life. No, you're totally right, man. I think we're good.

Speaker 5:          01:19:45       We're just experiencing an UN, like the safest time ever. You know? And we're sort of trying to find demons don't exist instead of

Speaker 4:          01:19:53       on the ones that do. Yeah. And that's to me, I think I mentioned it a couple times, but do you know if you're interested in wanting to tell that story, but about the time I did, I wasco because these plant medicines are that form of resistance. It is a bit of a trial by fire. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:20:07       it's going to, you're going to confront yourself with, you know, some of the darkest, deepest fears and concerns that you have. And, and that's, and that's the process by which it makes you better. It's not, you know, a magic potion. It's just like, here's resistance. How are you going to respond? And when you respond through that and you get, you just get better from it and you know, you feel better. I wonder with, with California, with this latest recreational marijuana marijuana law passed, I wonder how long it'll be before someone tries to do some sort of a psychedelic clinic, whether it's for a addiction to opiates, like a and a Boogie Boga I began a clinic or um, if this kratom stuff, you know, this, there's shit, what do you think about this? Cause I think I did a podcast with Chris Bell the other day. He was trying to explain it to me and to me Kratom in mild doses it Kratom or is it creative?

Speaker 2:          01:21:03       I don't know. Kratom Kratom I'm not, I'm not really sure. I don't even, I'm in mild doses. It seems to be like, uh, like a bit of an energy. Yeah. Energy buzz. And then in, in heavier doses it seems to be more like a painkiller. Like it's almost like a slightly euphoric but numbed sensations. It's a really interesting plant. You know, clearly I don't think there's any reason for it to be illegal. I haven't found personally a ton of value from it. And I find value in some other things. But the only thing I found disturbing, I said I was getting a bunch of text messages from people or tweets rather from people that were telling me that they had some addictive experiences with it, that it was very addicted to them, addictive to them. So I don't know if that's true or not. Um, I also don't know where you're getting it and what's in it.

Speaker 2:          01:21:48       Yeah. You know, I don't, I don't exactly know how pure that stuff is. I mean, this stuff is this, this is like a retail version of it. The Guy who sells it came with Chris. I trust that. But if you're buying it from a dealer, which is like essentially what a lot of people had to do for a long time. Like what? I'm not exactly sure what you're getting, you know, it's coming from Indonesia or wherever it's from. I would like to see some real tests done because, uh, to me, I tried it. I was like, this is like a mild stimulant. I kept, it kind of feels okay. Like it doesn't feel bad. Yeah. You know, it's interesting once you opened the doors to that scientific method with these plants, you find the amazing results. And I think that's what we're seeing in this, in this revolution of understanding of psychedelics.

Speaker 2:          01:22:28       Like I just read an and tweeted about a study on, uh, both silicide been an MDA for like social anxiety and social anxiety, you know, which are one of the things that you think of the classic school shooters syndrome, you know, it's this feeling of being excluded from your tribe, excluded from the social situation and the anxious and anxiety and all of the medications that are prescribed for these different feelings of feeling like you're not part of the group. Well, they wanted to test that with both mgma and with silicide siliciden and they found that it was effective with both, but differently. So they created this game called Cyber Ball, right. Where they had what seemed like just random other test subjects all in a circle

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       with a ball. And, but really it was researchers and then one test subject. And so to create social anxiety, they would play this game of catch and just not pass the ball hardly ever to the test subject. So We'd feel eventually like, man, what the fuck? Why aren't these people passing me the ball? Like what's wrong with me? And so they tapped into some and they would test that at baseline is placebo, right? The, the, at least in the kind of concern of like, man, what's wrong with me? Why do these people not want to give you the ball? And then they tested the baseline for Placebo, gave him the whatever placebo they were using, and then they tested it with psilocybin. And what they found with silicide been was that it dramatically reduced their amount of anxiety, their angst or stress about not giving the ball there. They were just looking at him like, man, look at these people. They just don't want to pass me the ball. That's cool. You know, and so and so, but they could accurately tell. Now Mdm may also reduce social anxiety, but in a different way. The People Mtma thought they were getting the ball all the time. They thought like they had no idea that they weren't on the ball. They're like, Oh man, I got passed through all the time. It was amazing. He loves money, Dude. They

Speaker 2:          01:24:13       just will love and other people catching the ball. Yeah. So, so happy for you man. You caught it. Oh, you through it. He got an a I'm happy for you too dude. Yeah. That an interesting Mtma can be extremely beneficial to anybody. At least one trip. I just found the only trip that I did, I was, I was like, this is really, you can learn something from this. Well it's also, you know, like a Mescalin which comes in both what tumor, the San Pedro Cactus and pay ot is also a Sarah to nudge it kind of psychedelic. So if you haven't had a lot more to MDM, very similar. Yeah. I mean, MDM may is, you know, like a more pharmaceutical approach to elevating serotonin in that feeling that this associated with selling Serotonin in your body, whereas the masculine drive, psychedelics do that in a similar way, but with the little bit more of a visionary component.

Speaker 2:          01:25:01       So, um, but both have, you know, once one is just a more direct application and I think that's great for a situation like maps is testing with ptsd and certain other kinds of situations because it's very reproducible. It's very like clinical reaction of what's going to happen in the brain. Whereas something with like what Chuma gives you this overwhelming experience, but it's woven in with all kinds of other different things. The problem really holy resides in the fact that these drugs are illegal because if they, if they weren't illegal we would look at them. It was like, wow, this might be solutions for people suffering from Ptsd, from this, from that social anxiety, social anxiety. And also kind of gives you your brain a chance to almost detached like a lens that detaches from the camera, get a look at the inner workings of the thing. And then before you put it back on, you kind of get a better understanding of it. And so I guess there's a detachment that MDA has like from some of the nonsense you've carried around with you, like clothes that you know, you've just worn it your whole life. You don't realize bullshit until you

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       take something that makes you feel like this is all so ridiculous. Like, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:26:08       what, what, what I think, you know, talking to the psychologist and the psychiatrist of why it's so beneficial is we all carry a lot of trauma. We all carry these things from our past that are the stories. And I think that was another thing I keep talking about the Jordan Peterson podcast, but he talked about that self authoring program, which is rewriting these stories. Well, he was talking about actually writing it, but what MDM is doing for people with Ptsd and with anybody is it's going back and looking at all of these traumatic things in our history and our past and which is also one of the things that in the studies that they're showing, they have a psychologist, psychiatrist who's guiding people back to these potential traumatic events. But when you're flooded with Serotonin, you see things in a totally different perspective. You see things from the vantage vantage point of love and it's all good.

Speaker 4:          01:26:52       So no matter what situation came about, you'll see that kind of higher perspective rather than that fear response, that kind of cringing, that creates more fear and more trauma. You look at it and you're able to relax, see it and say, man, that was pretty horrible, but you know what? It's okay. Like I'm still okay. I still have these bright things. And you repattern the, uh, you repattern that traumatic experience. So when you go to draw that back up from your past, you're drawing up a different recategorize experience. Like you're rewriting the software that's, you know, always rewriteable like those rewriteable floppy disks. You know, you take that thing out, you rewrite it with a whole different hue of your neurochemicals in the feelings that you surrounding it. And then when you access it again, or when it's just carrying around in your, in your memory, then it doesn't have the same sting.

Speaker 4:          01:27:41       It doesn't have the same trauma. And that's one of the mechanisms of action of of MDA and also what they're looking at with Iowasca Iowasca going back, not flooding you necessarily with Serotonin, but showing you that if these events in a slightly different perspective showing you well, hey that's actually what made you so ambitious and so strong and this traumatic thing that you thought was so horrible, it actually brought out all of these other benefits and it was actually, you know, if you really see from the person who the perpetrators perspective, you know, look at all the sadness that created that look at where he was coming from so you repattern that traumatic event and then it's not carrying that sign, the same dramatic, terrible weight, that lifeless body that you're trying to carry around. It's just been rewritten.

Speaker 5:          01:28:23       There's also the perspective that who you are like as a person right now is an accumulative effect of all your experiences. That's what makes you who you are. Well, if you have some mind blowing experience, which is what the psychedelic experiences you are going to change, like you're going to be a different person. I mean, it might be a, a microscopic shifted the dial. Like if you had a safe and you are clicking click, click, click. It might be like one click click like after a psychedelic experience and then you might have another psychedelic explains. You might get a double click, click, click, you know, but it's very small movements, right? But ultimately you're a different person. So if even if it's a small movement, that new experience has given you a chance to sort of mock the things that were threatening you just momentarily, just as just a few moments ago, just four hours ago before he took the mushrooms, he like, God, why was I worried about that? That's nothing like it gives you that opportunity because you're literally a different person now. You've had this experience. The fucking problem is they're illegal. If they weren't illegal, you'd be able to eat because it has the big fear, right? How do I know what I'm taking? Of course, how do you know what you're taking? You don't fucking know. You don't know because big Daddy Pharma has paid off the fucking big daddy government to keep it out of your greasy little hands so you can't trip balls and live in the woods like a fucking Pixie.

Speaker 4:          01:29:39       The beautiful thing is though, it's common cause I think the open, as soon as they opened the doors to clinical research, it's an undeniable force. Like you cannot deny the evidence that's coming back from the maps. You know phase two clinical trials. You cannot deny the evidence coming out of Johns Hopkins and these are the research institutes about psilocybin. They are helping people with conditions and you just, you know, follow the scientific method all the way through and all the plants are going to arrive. Like we're going to get them all home. We've got to get trump on drugs for sure. We've

Speaker 5:          01:30:08       got to get the new president to do DMT. If we got him to do DMT, it would change so much or just just a little dose of mushrooms, Bro. You don't even have to get crazy. Take a gram and a half, just a gram and a half or a little reset. Just a little reset, just a little little sit back and a little, wow, what? What are we doing here? What are we doing here? Exactly? What are we doing here? I just think this is a unique and special time and as long as we can be aware and as long as we, we, we verbalize that. We say it all the time. This is a unique and special time. Let's capitalize on this unique and special time. Let's use this unique and special time to establish a new understanding for this generation and to set things up way better for the next generation.

Speaker 5:          01:30:53       Dude, my parents, I'm older than you. My parents were essentially raised by barbarians. They came over on a fucking boat. They had no idea what was over here. You know their, their parents did it really like my grandparents parents did it. That came over from Italy and from Ireland. They were savages, man. They were hardly different from the people that came over on the boats during the pilgrim days. There were barbarians. They just had a little bit more culture, a little bit more language, a little bit more. This. They beat the shit out of their wives. They were always drunk. There are monsters. A lot of them, they're just crazy people scratching and clawing. Their understanding of life during the Ed Sullivan show, their understanding of what the world was really all about. It's so far removed from the average 20 year old with a an internet account who can go on youtube. As long as he stays away from those flat earth videos, he's going to have a real good understanding of how this mother fucker works and a way better understanding than any grown adult with children did in the 1950s when my parents were kids. There's no fucking way. There's no, you can't compete. So I think that we have this unique opportunity to set up the future

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       society where all of this silliness that we still have to deal with. Like the wiki leaks email that came out about Hillary Clinton has said that she opposes marijuana quote in every sense of the word. You can't do that anymore. You can't do that anymore. Like that to me, that people were still willing to support that. Like this, oh this is better than him. He grabs pussies. Is it, are you sure it's better? Cause I don't know if it's better. I think the whole thing's a mess. You can't have people stopping pinebrook Oh, it's all both the part with you, it's all about freedom and anybody that wants to stop pot, they can stop sex, they can stop whatever the fuck you want to do that they decide they can profit off of. You not doing that and you think they can't stop sex. Look what religion did to sex.

Speaker 2:          01:32:43       Sure. Right. Look how many people were burned for their sexual practices at the stake. Literally like you can ban absolutely everything. There's laws on the books that are throwing people in jail for homosexuality that will flare up still now like a k in different places of the world where they'll kill people for sex. So it's not that that hasn't even been tried, like the, the ability of the monstrous nature of humans to be able to impose those restrictions on people of the sovereignty of their own consciousness. And their own body. You can only ejaculate this way. You can only expand your consciousness in these manners. Like women can't drive. They have to dress like genies have to cover themselves. Genie. That's so wild. But yeah, it's like we got to discard all that shit and it's idea that you know, these, these pastors have more knowledge than someone who just spent, you know, a few days out in the woods doing mushrooms.

Speaker 2:          01:33:36       Like, are you sure you know the other ones photo from heaven, he's got a lock. Yeah, he's, he's, he's at all, there was a story that was out just a couple of days ago about some woman in Indonesia that received a hundred lashes for like being around a man, being too close to a man. There's a bunch of people that were publicly flogged for sex crimes, but there were sex crimes as similar, like as, as, as innocuous as a woman was too close to a man. Like they gave her like 90 lashes or some crazy shit. All the little boners on find the fucking robes west from the people who are lashing. The way I hear it as a student gets a hundred lashes for sex outside marriage and Indonesia. So he got a hundred lashes and there was another one about a woman that dude looks just like the male dudes in that fucking sex bdsm dungeon porn from San Francisco where they took that old prison out and they all fucking dress like that and locking people up.

Speaker 2:          01:34:26       It's the same dude. He just gets to do it in public. Oh, it's even extra kinky. I got to whip people in fucking public. She was flogged with a rat and candy. Say Rattan. How'd he say it? Written cane. Yeah. At least seven times for being too close in close proximity to a man. So they beat her with a cane seven times for being in close proximity to a man. That 32 year old male who was with her was also flogged seven times. Hmm. That's interesting. Let's take a look at that sentence is structured. The 34 old one was flogged with a Kane at least seven

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       times being in close proximity to a man. That's the Har. The 32 year old male who was with her was also flagged seven times like that's, it's not the man and the woman were both flag flog seven times each. It's like the woman horror upon horrors. This beautiful young woman was flogged because she had sex with a man or because she was close to a man. That dude was flogged too, but fuck him. You know, and the woman, it hurts so bad. The woman said, she cited AFP raising her arms in the air. What about the dude? The dude didn't even ask him that. Even ask the dude. Fuck him. He said, dude, that fucking CIS gendered asshole with his male privilege is white mates probably white in Indonesia. They probably would have given them a hundred if he was black.

Speaker 4:          01:35:41       Yeah, man, it's, I went to the dungeon of the inquisition in Italy and that's, that changed my whole perspective on everything.

Speaker 1:          01:35:48       Put that back up. Let's do this one, but we'll go back to where you were. Here we go. Look at this. No, no, no. Oh, Jamie doesn't know how to do the Internet. Okay. The a man found guilty of sex outside the marriage was also flogged at least 22 times by the person delivering the punishment who is dressed in long robes and a hood. His partner who was two months pregnant is still waiting for her fate to be decided, wow, she's pregnant and they're going to decide her fate. Whoa. In such situations, officials in the province usually order the flogging of the woman after they give birth. Holy Shit. Holy Shit. That's Indonesia 2016 that is holy Shit. That's scary. That is just what happens when people decide what the rules are. You can't let people decide the rules and

Speaker 4:          01:36:43       and Lou and have false metaphysical underpinnings, have that underpinning that. That's someone who deserves that kind of punishment, you know, have that, you know, you lose the idea. There's fundamental things. That's me living a different life. What I want to do that to me like do you understand the actual truth of the urges that that person had and the truth of everything? You start turning everything on its head and then you get these crazy rules and abilities like, and it's not just Indonesia, like I went to the dungeon of the inquisition in Italy and it was so much fucking darker than a cane. She may feel it when you're in the room for sure. It was, it was nauseatingly especially when you start seeing that 60% of these fucking things have to do with your genitals, like burning rods. They're shoving and Dick Holes and assholes and, but it's all for Jesus the way.

Speaker 4:          01:37:26       Yeah, exactly. For Jesus, like the absolute antithesis of the Jesus message when you really look at it. Mystically but like if like from the, from the what, the metaphysical truths of what he's espousing and then somehow they go from that to that. And I think it's, again, it's like that incremental creep, you know, towards a little bit harsher punishments, a little bit more sadistic, you know, and you get more and more and more and you get that, you start feeding that urge for sadism, that urge to, to not only, you know, punish somebody but to do it in the most horrifying way. And you know, that's part of human nature.

Speaker 5:          01:38:02       We know about the Stanford prison experiments, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. If you haven't heard about that folks look it up. Um, it's really interesting story. They, um, they had these students and these college students at Stanford, they put them through this experiment where some of them were guards and some of them were prisoners and the guards almost immediately started abusing the prisoners. They fucking cancel it. They had to cancel. They just stop it short.

Speaker 4:          01:38:28       Yeah. It's a, and I think, you know, the problem is, is that we all try to, we all try to bury these, these thoughts, these darker thoughts that we have. You know, like all of us inside of us, you know, you look at times of war and you know, whole armies that would go, part of why they would go on these contracts was for rape. You know, like we all think of ourselves like as as men now, like man, I would never be capable of of doing anything hurting anybody else. But inside our genetics, inside the things that was passed along our lineage where warrior cultures that probably produced are fucking ancestors through rape, like that's part of every individual, these dark thoughts. This, it feels somehow good to hurt somebody else. And the fact that we deny those entirely, they become monsters, you know, is where if you just acknowledge and like look at them and say, man, I'm all the bad stuff, I'm all the good stuff, it's all good. What am I going to choose to do? You know, what do I want to put out in the world? And I think that's a really important, important facet to recognize that, you know, we're all, we're all fucked up, you know, but it's our choice to decides, you know, who we really are and what we want to bring into the world. Are we going to make this amazing video game a better place, a better game? Are we going to make it miserable for everybody? We encountered,

Speaker 5:          01:39:41       I've always wondered about, um, mob rules. Like I've always wanted about the mob mentality. Like what is that? Where's that coming from? Is that coming? Is that like an acceptance of war? Like is that, I wonder if that's some sort of a survival mechanism when you able to do horrific shit, as long as everybody around you is doing horrific shit, it's all a sudden the, the, the collective mindset shifts and new rules apply. Like if people are coming over the fence and y'all have axes and you're coming out of them, you're doing things you would never do on a daily basis. You're hacking off arms and attacking people. And once it's real, it's real. Right? Once the first guy gets an Arrow through the fucking head and you see the shit going down, like you're swinging and it's all going crazy and everyone around you is doing the same thing and no one, no one could go, guys, guys, seriously, no, what are we doing? Let's let's stop here and let's realize we could all get along. There's plenty of vegetables for everybody. Let's stop the rape and get to know these girls. They'd cut your fucking head off and let your house on fire and stab your mom. They would go crazy. I mean that's what they did. Yeah, blood lust. This is something, a thing, because there's a, something that happens. There's a thing that happens to people when you have that mob mentality,

Speaker 4:          01:40:49       you could probably look at like Steve, someone like Steven Kotler can probably you more about the,

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       you know, the adrenaline in neurochemical response that's creating this version of yourself that sucks, supercharged and these certain things. So your empathy, you know, your empathy ratings go way down. It's like you're looking at the westworld control board, right? And it's like empathy ratings, way down, aggression way up like all of these different neurochemicals that are changing, like literally changing yourself into something that is much more favorable for those actions. Right. You know, it creates a collective mindset.

Speaker 5:          01:41:24       The individual, because it's one of the things you hear all the time about war is the, the really noble, heroic warriors who sacrifice themselves to save others. It's one of the main themes that we love hearing about like the guy who dives on the grenade to save his people, to save the guys who are around him. Like that is something that happens in that crazy, that crazy environment of that intensity of life. It's one of the weirdest things about a man is how many people who go through that say it was the best time of their life and they'd love to go back. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:41:57       Well, presence, man. I really think that anytime your presence, every time you're present, you're some of the best time in your life. Not like Christmas present. Yeah. No. Like when you're just present, like when you're, you're in flow state when you're in war because part of it is that intense threat, you know, like you don't have time to think about your email that incessant, you know, voice from your phone to check. Instagram is not in your fucking head. You're more, you know, and that's, it lends, some girl's been like dm and and Dan, let's go on down, we'll meeting up tonight for sure. And I think probably at a certain level of like Tim Kennedy, he might have those thoughts like it's just so called for him. Doesn't fuck well the Musashi thing. Yeah, exactly. That's probably why you actually started having to fight with oars because at a certain point with a sword, he probably wasn't even getting the same feeling anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:42:44       Right. Probably didn't even feel like a sword battle. It was like a, like a sparring match when you know you're going 20% and you're all relaxed and shit rather than when you're just knowing like, all right, these people are coming for me. It's a different kind of mental state that you get in. And maybe, you know, the or thing was like, all right, I'm just not feeling it. I'm too good. Well, he actually realized to that or had a much longer reach. So who's cracking dudes in the head from the outside? So there was actually a good strategic element to the or, and I said, I'm pretty sure he whittled the or down like a, and he would show up super late and then he said to James, just be so tired. They'd be just freak. Oh my God, am I gonna die tonight? They'd be thinking of that for hours and then finally shows up. Yeah. But back then mean, what do they had fucking Sun dials on the wrists. How'd you even know what time it was? You could definitely get away with a lot more. There's a lot of wiggle room for fucking dawn. What's done to you bro? Midday to midday is a real fucking day. We're supposed to meet Jesus high noon. Come on. What does that even mean? Yeah. Unless you're around a Sundial. Yeah. And even that seems like it'd be hard to get that right. Nobody had that on rest. I was only the flintstones.

Speaker 1:          01:43:54       Flintstones fucking Sundial. That's hilarious. I wonder who the front, the first dude with a watch that he carried around. What a pimp doc. I must've been clap mother fucker. He opens it up like a coffin flavor. Flave size hanging from his neck. Like when, let's, let's just guess when was the first pocket watch created? I'm going to say 16 hundreds is that, is that ambitious? I say 1712 woo. Jamie civic. Very specific. It's like price is right, right. The very first pocket watch. If you have a pocket watch tape, by the way, you're an asshole. If it's hanging from your vest and a string and you drinking handmade beer, you piece of shit. Stop using mustache wax. Stop, stop dressing like you live in a different time zone.

Speaker 1:          01:44:48       What did those, those brothers, those brothers that used to, everybody had drank out of mason jars and all the wood was raw. All their commercials like they're all wearing spat. Damn Tino for wow. Are Way smarter than I give him credit. Why don't we were both off by, I was on Bart over a hundred years to work about 40 hours though. But good enough dude. Why so picky? 40 hours as a whole week. You could use it for the week for working. Huh? Look at it. They were small enough to be worn around the neck or carried it in a bag or pocket. Interesting. Did they have a photo of one of those? Is someone, one of those still exist today? See if it still exists. Gangster. Cause you get a statue made out of you. If you could invent the pocket, whatever, you're a dope motherfucker. Cause he didn't know. But that was what led to the Apple Watch. He didn't know at the time it's going to be, you can never get away. Is that what it looked like?

Speaker 1:          01:45:37       Hmm. I wonder, do you think you'd just slapped that thing out on the table? If you're trying to impress a girl, fuck this giant giant like Harare keys for archies never stay in the pocket. Right. Breaking those things out. Always wearing like a ring going around your finger. Wow. Look at the mechanism in that thing. Holy Shit, man. That's gorgeous. That's a thing that people super dork out about madness. Handmade watches. Yeah, I didn't, I had no idea. My friend Mark Della Grad [inaudible], you know markdale grantee. Mark del Grande's a watch nut. So was a Anthony Giordano. What a fucking coincidence. Two guineas. Two shiny guineas. I really watched nuts, but uh, they did. Anthony was telling me that there's a anthony's, the guy was directed all my, except one of my comedy specials. I love that dude. He's directly UFC too. He told me that, uh, there's watches that are half a million bucks, like insane for a watch. I go, it just is what it looks like a regular watch. She's like, it looks like a regular watch. What's the deal? It's really rare then, you know, it's very accurate. The mechanism, it was like super complex, all handmade and it takes like six months to make one. I'm like, what? Take six months to

Speaker 2:          01:46:49       make a watch. You know, you get, we have this one, 219,000. Oh my God. What does that, what does it look like? That's it. That's definitely not it. Oh my God. It looks like a transformer. Click on that. Looks like a Cobra. Oh, it's probably loading. Still. See how it's spinning up in the right at the top. I don't know. It's just not coming up. Huh? Should we fished? Be loaded fast. Wow though. Holy Shit. Click on the image. Just clicking the image instead of the link. What the fuck man? $219,000 for the ugliest watch you've ever worn, but everybody's going to know it's $200,000 and that's the rub son. I uh, Hubo it's funny. So my buddy bodie was sponsored by them and he got a bunch of watches and he just doesn't care about watches. So they were just like in the drawer with like the regular other stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:47:40       And I finally convinced him to flat to give me one and it's sweet, but it's not like a big deal. Like it's disgusting. That thing is ridiculous. That is so like a safe vault that looks like they would sell it at best buy in the line before you leave, where they have the candy. They got that design from sharper image for sure. From sharper image. That is so ugly. That is such a weird looking stupid watch. Look at that guy. So site, look at it. Look at his yellow eyes like the dude from sin city. He's like how rich banks. Thank God he's so happy. He's going to jump in his Ferrari and take it to his private jet and cause Dick talked to all the way to Monaco.

Speaker 2:          01:48:22       That'll probably happen. Look at those fucking ugly watches man. They're so gross. Look at the one where the guy's wrist in the upper right hand corner. Jamie up there. Yeah. Look, look how big. That stupid thing is. Definitely needs to be bigger. That is crazy. It looks like an alien locked onto that dude's wrist. Like some alien bug like like the running man fucking the neck, the neck piece. They would explode like that. Watch might just clamp down and remove your hand. Blow your hand off. Squirt, squirt, squirt. Yeah. Fuck that. Watch $219,000 that's so stupid. It's ugly. Yeah. Swatch costs just another way to, none of the way to subtly shit on people. Weird man. Just show your show your status, your identity and blah blah blah. It's, you know, it's these, these games, the games that we like to play to, to push our, to what Jordan was saying, like create that temporary inequality, you know, create that appearance of inequality.

Speaker 2:          01:49:21       I'm better than everybody because I have this giant fucking safe fault on my, on my hand that's had a conversation with this dude about watches and I was like, what kind of watches that, I guess it was one of those, uh, mvmt watches as a sponsor of the podcast and they only cost like 150 bucks and they're dope. They're nice, they're real, they're really nice looking watches and he's like, Oh man, I thought it was a nice watch. I go, but you thought it was a nice watch b. Dot. It was a nice watch, but now it's not a nice wash cause you know, it's only 150

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       bucks. It's still, it's still the same watch. It tells time, look at it, see it tells time. Said, what is this? How much is this piece of shit? 5 million. Oh my God. It's the same company q bolt. So you bought this, whatever. They've figured out how to find the retards. They figured out how to lock them in. This one down here is 25 million. Oh my Jesus. Fucking cool. What is that? This is the watch park. That's like a stellar nursery. That's what it is. That's how many million? 25 minutes. If you're a chick and you can get a guy to buy you that, your pussy is gold. You must have that Super Pussy that that snap and pussy. The Richard Pryor used to talk about in this whole records. Yeah, it's the pussy that extends into the soul. 30 million. Is it a pocket watch? The pocket watches 30 million. So you're an asshole and you spent $30 million cause anyone with a pocket watches an alcohol.

Speaker 1:          01:50:45       What is that thing? Look at it. It says it was started work on in 1782 and was finished in 1827 by the guy's son. Oh, that's different. That's different. That is wicked. So that that was a long to make that watch men's. You get drunk and left out at the bar. Hey guys, I'm super sorry. Did you see a price live watch? It's worth a couple of houses. It's worth more than a couple 30 million to work with a fucking mansion and a jet in the hamptons. You can live in the hamptons off a watch. Imagine that you get by the whole, you can just say, uh, how you gonna pay. I'm going to give you a watch. Like what? Imagine going back to like going back to like a primitive more tribal culture and like explaining how much value you could get for something silly like that.

Speaker 1:          01:51:35       You know, like, like there was this watch and I could buy houses and have control vast lands and get unlimited food and, and make people evolve varieties, do all the things I wanted just from this one little token. And they'd be like, well what does it do? And you're like, nothing does nothing but it's valuable. You know, they would be like, what the fuck are you talking about? Like there's not a better arrow. Like it's not a better, you know, it's just this, it's one of these things that comes up when you get a a society of of luxury like we have. Yeah, yeah. That's the status purchase. The status purchase. It's interesting. They're not even good. That's what a lot of them are not good. Like, uh, I've never bought a rolex for myself, but the UFC bought me a rolex long time ago.

Speaker 1:          01:52:18       It's just, it's beautiful watch. Right? Beautiful. But he was always running fast, like five minutes fast. So I brought it in and I'm like, I don't know what it is. But like after a month, it's like five minutes fast. The Guy Goes, oh yeah, yeah. They always do that. So you just got to bring it back and reset it every month. I went, what? Like you have the change at the time every month. This, this watch, I don't know how much it costs. I don't even remember, but I don't have to change the time. It's always right. It's right. It runs, it's got a quartz movement. He's like, Oh yeah, a quartz movement is just going to be more accurate than this. Well, why is what wait a minute. So these are just bad. They just suck at telling the time. They still fucking so bad to tell them the time to like five seconds or five minutes fast after like, uh, just a couple of months.

Speaker 1:          01:53:01       So you just got to accept that that's it. You just accept it doesn't really keep time. It's Sordo keeps time. The status with his dad, his bracelet that happens to keep time. How weird is that? They did not get in it. You have to check like with sea up. Nope. Launches off. Hold on. We'll watch like you've watched this gets off. Like you rely on the actual real clocks, like this fucking piece of shit that we wouldn't be spending like four bucks on this, that things right all the time. It's never wrong. You wind that bitch up to four o'clock it and then when it's five it'll show you it's five. It's fucking right. It's always right. It didn't cost anything. Yup. Yup. But that's rolex bitch

Speaker 4:          01:53:41       doesn't satisfy the ego in the same way. It doesn't get it fired up. It doesn't let you get to feel better about yourself. So that, you know, I think when you really don't know, again, going back, you don't know the self, you want to feel better by your, about yourself by making yourself better than somebody else because you have no other reference point of what it is. So, all right, if I'm better than these other people, you know, whether it's something you have or something you are inherently are the Melanin in your skin or whatever the fuck you want to say. If that makes you better than someone else, then you can, then you can feel better about yourself. Well, I don't know who I am. I don't know if I'm good or bad, but at least I'm better than these fucks. You know? And then that makes you feel better. But it's all, it's all this fucking bullshit game that we try to tell ourselves. It comes from the fundamental lack of knowing who we are and knowing that whoever we are is enough and it's all good. And we're all the same.

Speaker 1:          01:54:32       You say that, but Boris, the guy with that fucking transformer on his rest, he was getting his dick sucked right now while drinking vodka flying his private jet over the Atlantic. He disagrees with you. That girl knows that that's a $250 million watch or whatever the fuck he's wearing it. She knows he's bawling adequate control on his private jet. It's covered with feathers. Boris got his whole jet decked out like an eagle. The wings actually flat somehow makes the flying worse that they flat just for effect and that's when he starts coming. Ah, when the eagle wings flap, while he's looking at his watch, oh he looks at his watch at the girl and then out the window in that order, the best, the best moment of his life. And then he shoots himself in the head cause he knows it will never be any better.

Speaker 1:          01:55:29       Everything has been building to that shoots a couple holes in the plane so that it fucking crashes and then shoots himself. There was, the Eagle Wings would clearly bring the plane down. Actually the minute you activated Eagle Wing, that plane is fucking taken. It taken a nose dive and a captain solely. No one's ever gone out on top, right. No one's ever had like the ultimate life like that. And then you said, I think it doesn't get any better than this. Let's just, we're good. We're good. Boom. No, I was watching the Loma Chenko uh, walters fight the other night. Did you see that fight, that boxing match? God Damn facil look, think you save a seal. If I see a woman Chanko the silly I've heard Wassily um, but Lama Chanko is a masterful boxer. I mean, he just boxed it shit out of this dude. This dude was undefeated and just footwork, just unbelievable footwork and ability to predict where his, where the punches are coming from, his opponent where he's going to have openings.

Speaker 1:          01:56:28       And he was just lightened this dude up in the last round and a at the end of the last round, that dude just quit. He just quit. He quit in the seventh round. Just said, I'm done. Like he didn't get knocked down. He didn't get like we got staggered in the six round or in the seventh round. He gets staggered, but it wasn't to the point where you thought they would end the fight cause he ended the round on his feet, went back to his corner, walked, sat down. I was like, fuck this, it's over. And then you know, in his post fight speech was just basically saying, look, the guy was hitting me too much. I just thought I saw the writing on the wall. Check, please. That's smart actually. What people should do that you just want to see him for your own, for your own desires.

Speaker 1:          01:57:06       You want to see him go out on their shield. Like that's the noble way to do it. Knock you out. Do you know why Pat Barry vs check Congo. Remember that shit? Yeah. You just never know. Never Know Pat Barry vs check Congo was like one of the craziest one round. Slobber knockers ever Pat Barry. I had checked Congo all kinds or hurt had him staggered and Pat Barry super aggressive. He's trying it on and smashing check Congo and add a know where Congo on corks all bomb. I mean, pat has got check Congo, all kinds of hurt. He's rocks. And with that overhand right co Congo gets up, he's tagging them and it looks like he's almost out of his feet. I mean, he's getting hit by bombs here. He's all kinds of hurt. Pat Barry sprawl and he keeps a fight standing as Congo tries to take them down and hits with another right hand rock some again, boom, another couple punches.

Speaker 1:          01:57:59       And He, Pat Barry Looks fucking unstoppable here. Look at this again. But now as he closes in, boom, he gets clipped with that right hand in hand. How cold? Two punches later out of nowhere. Crazy. I mean that is as close as someone's comes to the brink of disaster and come back instantaneously, instantaneously and won by knockout, wasn't it? Didn't Chris leave and do that to somebody? Vandelay he did it. The vandelay starched vandelay vandelay came out and blast him with the right hand. Had him hurt, but he fell into the trap because lead punches so fucking hard. And he always had an iron chin and you just uncorked one on vandelay vendor and like, oh, nothing happened weekend. Right. Did you watch

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       the bride? Was it Derek Brunson fought? Yes. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:58:45       Well similar in a way, but more calculated. Dark Bahnson just got crazy and he, it fought Robert Whitaker who won the ultimate fighter Australia smashes addition. Was it Australia versus England? Is that what it was? No, I forget what it was. What did they, what who was competing on anyway, whitaker one and a whitaker since moving up to one 85. He's just so much better than it was at one 70 and Derek Brunson just came after him. Derek bronze is the same guy who he had just knocked out, um, uriah hall. He caught him with a beautiful left hook and heard them and it was just crazy fight. And then he came back from that sort of employ the same strategy against whitaker. But what did your, kept it together? Kept together? God, he ate a lot of shots, kept moving, no, kept his hands up, kept his composure and then finally found an opening him boom.

Speaker 5:          01:59:34       Dropped one on Brunson and then had Brunson crazy hurt and then moved in on him. So it was an awesome, it was an awesome exhibition for Wediko show that whitaker could overcome the storm of like a super confident and really dangerous guy who hits fucking hard, who's had a lot of confidence because of his most recent success doing that. I mean, Bronson came after him, really, really came after him. Super aggressive, maybe too aggressive for sure. And now in hindsight you could say that, but a lot of people other than whitaker probably would a wilted to that storm. So it's interesting. It was a really stern test for whitaker and showed you how strong he is. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:00:09       It was one of the, one of the beautiful aspects of watching these different, this chess play out with the whole body being utilized. You know, you're never going to beat it for its excitement level. No. Yeah. You have to realize

Speaker 5:          02:00:20       while you're watching it that liked life, nobody gets out for free. Yeah. Like life. I mean, it's almost a microcosm of life. It's crazy struggle and it, you know, it doesn't always end your way is this is what competition is in mixed martial arts is the most extreme version of problem solving. We have outside of war, some most extreme with dire physical consequences. You get brains like we saw Pat Barry get k out there, you know what I mean? That's the consequences of this game. But the, the, the, the reality or the, the, the take is nobody gets out anyway alive. Yeah. You can, if you choose to experience this, this extremely high level, very short bursts, understand how much resources you're burning off, understand what you're doing and you know, proceed wisely.

Speaker 4:          02:01:10       And when, uh, when I talked to fighters who, you know, sometimes question like, man, what am I doing it myself? I'm just beating people up. And that's what I do, you know, to remind like remind them that what really is happening is two people are coming to an agreement to provide a form of resistance for each other. Like at the highest level of what this is like you're going to come face to face with someone who's also training and also striving to do everything that you're trying to do, which is what's going to push you up against that form of resistance and give an opportunity

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       not only to overcome physically, but overcome emotionally, spiritually, psychically, everything. You know, you'll have to bring everything to bear against that form of resistance, whether it's the weight cut or the opponent or the training or everything. And there's something to be said for that. The, obviously the only issue for a lot of people is that you end up paying that price, not only then, but later if you get the brain damage, you know, and that's, that's the only bummer of it and something that, um, to be considered, but as if it wasn't for that man. What a fucking beautiful way to do it. Like to get everything, everything all together, unified in one and provide that ultimate form of resistance. It's like unbeatable. It was definitely the most difficult physical challenge that we know of because you're competing, especially at the highest level, you're competing with someone who's the same size as you, has a commensurate level of expertise as you and is as motivated as you are to win, and you're in this crazy competition together where you're literally playing a game of press the button and then who you know who's who can shut off, who's central nervous system quicker.

Speaker 2:          02:02:48       What I'm fucking crazy game you. You, you're never going to duplicate the excitement of that with any other sport. You come close. Like I guess football is probably pretty close for people. Boxing's probably a right up there in moments, you know, like when one men wall Ma, let me say that again. One man, well Marquez knocked out Pacquiao. He hit him with that beautiful clean, straight punch and just flat and Pacquiao. That was about as dramatic a moment that you get in any sort of combat sports. You see a superhero like pack. Yeah, get leveled with one shot. I'm like, Whoa, but that woe is just so much more prevalent and mixed martial arts that whoa happens so much more often. It's a totally different thing. And I think the, the more rules that you put in, in, in front of that kind of primal conflict, you know, the, the little bit more, it kind of separates it.

Speaker 2:          02:03:39       It makes it a sport. You know, like when you see boxers kind of grabbing each other and doing nothing about it, you know, that's when that moment of like, oh yeah, this is a sport. Right. Whereas in MMA, there's fewer of those moments where you go like, oh yeah, this is a sport. It really just feels like people fighting to the death. Yeah. They're the only moments where you go to sports. Like, you can't grab the fence, or I am punched the balls, or Oh, he pumped it high timeout. Yeah. Yeah. There's moments in boxing where you go, well, this is kind of silly. You know, how come you can just hang on like this? How come that guy can't trip you and take you down? How come he can't kick your legs? Right. You know, it's really hard for me to watch boxing sometimes and not think about kicking someone's legs like, or someone kicking someone's legs rather. Not that I'm running around, man. I mean, I'm see the way they're standing and I'm like, yeah, well there's those little thoughts like this is effective. As long as someone's not kicking your legs. Yeah, we know. But if you're fighting the same fight, but you're, you know, you're fighting someone like Joe Schilling, it's going to be fucking kicking the shit out of your

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       legs. Yeah. You know, it's a totally different experience and he's a long dudes. She's going to be standing way on the outside and if you don't know how to deal with that, you're only going to be able to absorb a few of those before you're useless. Yeah. Or you think of like Badr Hari's like leaping overhand, right. Where he commits everything, all of his childhood pain and to that right hand, right. You can't do that all the time. And mma because someone would just duck underneath it in double leg, but he's never had to worry about that. So you know, it's still still, he's one of the most exciting motherfuckers ever and he's fighting against soon. He's fighting Rico Verhoeven going to be on December 10th. Yeah, that's a crazy night. There's a gang of fights that night, that same night. Bernard Ha. No, no. Bernard Hopkins is the 17th he's making his final fight.

Speaker 1:          02:05:21       But uh, that same night is a, the UFC from Toronto. It's glory and there's something else going on that night too. There's some sort of a boxing fight that night as well. It does it, but it's a crazy night. That's a, it's a weird fight, man. Verhoeven and bought her Harry Potter hard. He's a scary dude literally and many, many, many ways. It's so fun to watch. He's just one of my favorites ever cause she's like you said, he just commits commencing this extremely violent way and sometimes he gets carried out on the shield. You know, he, sometimes he had goes down. Really can't shut that off. Like once he gets that thing going, I mean he would want to stomp his bone and after they're down and he's just a fucking savage. Yeah, he's definitely, I would love to see there a laundry list of Mexican supplements. I'm like, what kind of cocktail you guys run in here?

Speaker 1:          02:06:12       He definitely has hair braided around his dick, like Princess Leia. So big. Now. Have you seen him? You've seen the most recent photos of bought her pull up the recent photos of bought her hard cause he puts some photos on instagram of him training and you know, took pictures of him with his shirt off. He like what? Jesus Christ. He looks, he's about to 50 now, something like that. And he's a big giant dude. He's always been a big giant dude, but he's like super, super muscled out. Now look at this shit. He's fucking, he's fucking jacked. But there's uh, there's some other photos or maybe a little bit clear if you go there. It is right there. That one in the middle. What in the fuck is going on there? That dude's gigantic now. Yeah, I mean that's terrifying. That's gigantic. He's so much bigger than he was when he first started.

Speaker 1:          02:07:01       When he first started kickboxing, he was this long, tall, thin guy. Cause he started like some of his early fights that I've seen during the k one days. Even he was way skinnier like back in the day and then kicked out like put up. You want to see something put Badr Hari versus Stefan Leco. Um, and that was just typing Leco yeah, there it is. Stefan [inaudible] and this is Badr Hari look at like what he looked like back then. Upper left upper left image. Yeah. That's Badr Hari. Then look at the difference. Yeah. Crazy. He hits stuff on, go with a spinning back kick to the face and flatten them. They had fought previously and Leco stopped him with a spinning back kick to the body. So a, in the rematch, she, he hit him with one of the face. Crazy but look, great picture. Yeah. Beautiful. You could see that. Find the video. Find the video. Potter, Hari Kao, Stefan Leco. Um, there it is.

Speaker 6:          02:07:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:07:59       You got to think that this, this dude's probably put on like 50 pounds or something.

Speaker 1:          02:08:05       Yeah. Is this, this is Leco. Oh, this is Dubai. 2014 I think this is the other one. This is, that was a, yeah, that's it. You just had it right there. This is it. Here it comes. He throws one in messes. But look how skinny he is here, man. Yeah. Total different guy. Different selves. Yeah. Here it goes. Watch it. He set it up, set it up with a jab. He faked it to the body. That bomb goes up top. Damn flatline. Nothing quite like a, like that Barbosa kick. Yeah. Well that was almost a different one though, that he did it. A side kick to the face. It was a, he didn't do it as like a wheel kick. If you watch it again, rewind a little bit. He shot it as a straight kick. Rewind it. Uh, he, he threw it as if you see how he's throwing it there.

Speaker 1:          02:08:49       He threw it to the body. That's a spinning sidekick or turning sidekick. He's not doing it as a back kick. If you did the toes to be down, but see how he went up there. That was just a turning side kick to the face. It's kind of halfway between, both halfway between a wheel kick and a spinning back kick or a turning sidekick. But it was fucking beautiful. Boom. Look smaller wheel kick when I look at it there. But Jesus Christ the perfect Yup. Right on the blocks and Stefan Leco uh, who was uh, he was a great fight or two man. That guy. Yeah, he knocked a lot of dudes out, saw him knock out Peter Earths in Vegas One k one was just starting to come up. They were do it putting on some shows in Vegas this before the UFC was big. They thought that k one was, would I think really still think it could have if it was promoted properly, could have like gotten a grip in North America.

Speaker 1:          02:09:38       Well that's what, you know, Gloria is pushing that boulder now. Gloria is a good example. And so as lion fight, I prefer the rules of lion fight though. Cause lion fight is full. Moitai yeah, elbows. We went to one of those [inaudible] Vegas. Yeah. That's one of the few things that I go to see live. I still like to go see live. Yeah. Fuck man. A high level Moitai in America. It's like the level of the fights is very high. It's just people aren't just, didn't totally not aware of it yet. They need to be though. It's crazy exciting. It's just, and there's so much talent. It's not like this is an exciting thing, but only like five guys are good at it. It's an exciting thing where, especially in the lighter weights, like Thailand's full of fucking killers, they got a ton of them in Europe. They've got them all over the globe. There's so many good Moy Thai fighters out there. They just, for whatever reason, we haven't caught on yet. That's why I think when I think about this time, I think it's the best time ever because

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       we get to see all of these incredible contest, still extremely physical, like we're still at the rising peak of our physical prowess, but we're also at the peak of our technological prowess and the peak of our ability to access all of the best foods and access the best ideas and all of the different things that can shape us like as pessimistic as people get it is for sure the best of times right now. You know, for the majority of people now obviously they're hell's on the planet still. There's hell's that we can put ourselves in. There's suffering, but overall on the macro level, it's a fucking, it's the golden age now. Sure. Anybody argues with that? It's an asshole. Yeah. Yeah. I want to go back to a time where you had to speak with grunt and even in the future, like I can't imagine that the, I guess maybe maybe it would like maybe we've just seen too many gray aliens, you know, where the body kind of becomes less and less important and everything is focused on the consciousness. I feel like you get to that level and you fucking miss this, this certain, you know, evolution and epoch for the pleasure monkey where we had all of that physical access to strive and train and, and feel all the physical things as well as, you know, reach incredible heights in, in consciousness and meditation and you know, community and these, these great things. I think, you know, I think really no matter what stage before or after, I think we'll look back at this one. Like this was a special fucking time.

Speaker 1:          02:12:00       It's definitely a special time, but I think every time it's a special time because every time, no matter where you are and the timescale, if you're in that moment, you're in the most present time, you're in the most current time and I guarantee you at every step of the way, people were logging with nostalgia for the past. I bet they were like, God damn man, who used to rape is run across the village. Chop heads off and shit. Good old days, Bro. Yeah, good times before they started writing things down on paper is probably a lot of people that miss that they miss to shooting arrows. Just launched them in the air and whatever's over there. Fuck them. They did. They made it rain arrows from the sky

Speaker 4:          02:12:38       and like 50 years after that was over, some viking king had a slogan, let Denmark race

Speaker 1:          02:12:43       again. Everybody was excited. Not Denmark rape again. We let the killings begin a new, but that was a big problem with Japan's. If he didn't want to embrace the gun was like, no, you pussies can't be fucking shooting people with guns. That's such a bitch ass way to go. You got to use solar. It's come on, come on, don't be a bitch. But they, they, they've held on too long. They didn't embrace the gun. They need to get on that right away. If they had the Japanese engineering that you see today in Lexus, if they had applied that to guns back in the day, had same knowhow and discipline, they have the best gun stayed, not the best gun,

Speaker 4:          02:13:17       but you dedicate yourself and become masters in the world at swordsmanship and then the gun comes along, right.

Speaker 1:          02:13:23       Ah, fuck this. Fuck. This trumps all of my years of work. But the sword. Yeah. Yeah man, they made it easy.

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       I mean, it's sort of like a supermarket did for versus being a substance, a living off the land type person. You know, if you've watched those shows from a Alaska where the people are all living in and grow their own vegetables and shit and they catch fish in the river, there's something romantic about it. Write something that drags. I love those shows, man. I watch those shows.

Speaker 4:          02:13:53       You know, you like, you know, your purpose every day. And I think when people know their purpose, my purpose is to survive, get food, stay warm, you know, uh, make babies. Like it's really comforting to know what your purpose is. Well, yeah. And especially if you don't have any internet like before they got on television, I wonder how much access to Internet even had up there.

Speaker 5:          02:14:11       Ma, why watch this one family that apparently, you know that uh, that singer jewel, do you know who she is? She has a one snaggletooth but she's very beautiful and people like the fact that she doesn't fix her teeth because she's imperfect yet. Perfect. Um, she's apparently from this one family that has this, this show, goddammit Alaska, the final frontier. Is that the name of it? Uh, but anyway, it's her relatives. Yeah, I think, I feel like close relatives that live up there in this crazy way and it's a, you know, real simple like some of them farm and they raised cattle and they have to like move their cattle across this area to take them to where they graze and they drop them off. And they have to move them back at the end of the year. It's nuts. And so while they're up there doing this, grizzly bears just start ripping their fucking cows apart.

Speaker 5:          02:15:03       So now they have to go and deal with these, you know, 11 foot tall giant dog things that need food constantly to consume. And on one hand you can't blame them like these fat stupid cows just wandering around over by the grass. All they have to do is go by the grass. There's fucking hundreds of them. Where else are they going to find hundreds of things that they can eat? Nowhere. Like you just put out a buffet in front of the Grizzly bear and you're mad at their eating. It's bare supermarket. So they had a, he had a hunt them down. It's crazy watching this guy because although it is reality TV and you do not know how much of this show is, bullshit goes clearly, some of it's bullshit. There's clearly some setup. Like I saw one scene where they had a filleted salmon and the bear was supposedly getting fish from the river and it was coming too close to them while they're fishing. But you never saw the two of them, the same frame. And then you see the bear and the bear has a salmon that's filleted meaning like someone cut that Sam and threw it in the water and gave it to the fucking bear, which is like, come on stupid. You know. So you guys are the only people here, but yet the bear, you haven't caught a fish yet, but the bear is a fish that has filets removed off of it. Shut the fuck up man. I'm not stupid.

Speaker 4:          02:16:15       Yeah, that's the, that's the TV game. But it does give you like a little window into the wild ways that all of us humans live. It gives a window, which is cool. Like I got to um, there's this book before they pass away and you gave me that book.

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       Give me that. But yeah, it looks amazing. It's amazing photos. But then you start reading about these different cultures, like actually had the photographer on my podcast and he was telling me about, um, what is his name? It's called before they, pat Jimmy Nelson, Jimmy, Jimmy Nelson. So Jimmy Nelson was on the podcast and uh, he was talking about the Himba people, which have these amazing photos or like a really tall tribe. And I believe it was the Himba. And um, he was telling me about their custom, they live in just such a dramatically different way. So they're, they're like a pastoral shepherding kind of tribes. So they have all of their cows, but there's very little grass. So the men have to take the cows on these long walks to feed them like four weeks away. Right. But what they do is they leave one man behind in the, in the village, and it's his job to sexually satisfy all the women, all, well, all the men are gone. And that position rotates, right? So that everybody gets their turn as the one dude that gets to sexually satisfy the entire village. One of girls get pissed if it's all this motherfucker turn. Yeah. Hate is dirty. Dig to watch this little tiny dirty dance. There's certain guys that they're never, they're never on vacation for when it's, that guy's turning around. Some girls will hold out, but like I'm good, I'm good. You can go fuck my friends. I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait until Igor is term. Igor slangs that good deck.

Speaker 2:          02:17:56       No, I wouldn't want that. I only want her pleasure to come from my penis. Penis. I heard of the massage man. The way he touched her anus come so hard, tim. With all my being one day I will remove him from this life with a sword. It's so funny that someone who you love, someone else makes that person who you love gives them pleasure and interfaith their ass. She's got her ass up in the air. She's backing up into his tongue. Ah, nope, nope, no new, new, new, new, new. That's the thing that makes you vomit as a man because it triggers these, these things. But it can all be worked through. Like you can push through the other side and that's, you know, or you could shoot yourself or you could, I think we played that. We played that country song where it's like I flashed my headlights that are window.

Speaker 2:          02:18:47       Yeah. It all fucking crazy in your head about, or just be like, oh, the pleasure monkeys getting pleasure. Great. Yeah. Well men who freak out about other like girl there, girl liking another guy. Like, man, you can't win that one. You got to let it go. Because here's the thing. When someone likes someone, they fucking like someone and you're going to accept, Ooh, can't believe it's fucking cold. I'm going to go for a walk. Nuke it. Don't do it. You're going to freeze to dead. Fuck that. I like walking naked. I know you like walking naked, but he can't go walking naked. You're gonna fucking freeze to death is a reality of going outside when it's 30 below zero. Right. Okay. Well this is the same reality applies. So when someone doesn't like you, if a girl does not wanna have sex with you, but she wants to fuck the rock, there's not a lot you

Speaker 1:          02:19:27       could say about it. Okay? She's not, you will, you know the rock doesn't love you the way I love you. I love you forever in eternity. And it's not even like the body. It's like the soul now. It's not going to work. She's thinking of the rocket has giant Samoan Dick just ramming it home. That's what she wants. Okay, you got to accept that and you're going to have to enjoy another aspect of life other than having sex with one person who's now having sex with a rock or be happy for her and be like, man, that's fucking awesome. That's not going to happen once per, you know, just exactly. Look at that photo. Is that when he's holding one of the, uh, he's, he slings those fucking bigfoot's Bro. Those primal bells that we have, he slings that thing around like it's nothing. Yeah. That's an enormous human dude.

Speaker 1:          02:20:09       It's, it's possible to make that move, man. I mean, I've been working on it in my own life. It's fucking possible. It's hard. It's hard as fuck. But you know you can, you can transcend these things were and just understand that deeper metaphysical truth, pleasure for someone I love. Makes that person my friend, not my enemy. Of course. In theory I believe you. But for the sake of humor, I'm going to keep talking shit about the rock banging your sister areas. He's got a gorilla there. I can't believe he use two hands. What a bitch. I throw that around with one. Yeah, the rock. It's a strong human man and you know what? Just not just strong like physically but strongly. His personality, the way he projects himself. Like he's a perfect example of someone who projects like this very positive vibe man. He's like, this is very energetic, positive, happy vibe.

Speaker 1:          02:20:58       It's very infectious. Like I see that guy talking. He does like youtube clips or instagram clips rather. A little videos he makes and his, his positivity and genuine enthusiasm and happiness is so infectious. I'm a fucking fan boy of the rock. I said it. I fucking said it. I don't care. You know, he's got a great bit Andrew Santina. I don't, I'm not going to give out a word of it. Not a word. I cannot, I cannot even, but if you get a chance, Andrew Santiago has a fucking hilarious bit about the rock. God Damn, it's good. It's really funny. But um, that kind of person, man, like those are fuel, those, those are, that's human fuels. That guy's like a, a light. So like, I mean, I, I've come to look at ourselves like a, like a software operating system that can constantly get rewritten a little bit by even by the people that you're around, you know, whether it's, you want to look from the point of like mirror neurons, you actually experiencing the same emotional state that the person you're around and, or if it's just ideas or thoughts or whatever you want to, however you want to look at it, it's like adding a little bit of code to our code base.

Speaker 1:          02:22:02       And sometimes it's helpful and sometimes it's a virus, but the more you surround yourself with people with that kind of positive vibe, it's like building on the software in a positive way. When you're around these more negative people, they're implanting different little, you know, bugs and viruses that you're going to have to scan and remove later. Essentially all open source. Exactly. 100% open source. Some beings are open source but uh, you know, mine your firewall.

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       Totally, totally. Should I be careful? Put yourself in situations where you're adding to that positive code base, the books you're reading, the things you're listening to, you know, and, and be careful of the things on tv to that are adding to the, you know, creating more of the viruses. Reince like supporting these negative thought patterns, these, these limiting beliefs, these things that are not helpful for the coaches,

Speaker 5:          02:22:48       committed to do these things that you have in your idea and in your mind like don't be so set in your ideas. Cause understand that people have to be just as sat in their ideas in order to, I'll lash someone for being in close proximity with a man or to lash. Someone who had sex with a woman. You know those, those people have the same. Or to wait til a woman who's pregnant gives birth before you give her a beating with a stick because she had sex. That's the, those people believe what they believe just as firmly and a lot of the notions that we have that we think there are rigid rules. They're not rigid rules except dudes with man buns. Let it go. Let it go. Stop twisting your mustache in a circle. No more man Bun. No more pocket watch. Fuck you. How about that

Speaker 4:          02:23:36       says the man with the fanny pack on. Ironically,

Speaker 5:          02:23:42       but you know what I'm saying.

Speaker 4:          02:23:43       Yeah man. Man. Bus. They're not necessary. What are you doing, Steven Seagal. He doesn't even wear one anymore. He gave it up and we were pat. I got some man been friends. They're going to be disappointed. I know they are. They're trying hard. They're trying hard to wear that vest. Yeah. Those weird shoes, the wooden soles, everybody just j everybody's just looking for love and they're looking to judge themselves as a good person, you know? And, and that's, that's, those are two things that you can get yourself, you know, you can understand that you're worthy of love and supply that and you can understand that you're a good person. Just being a person. Like, you know, you don't have to be better than somebody. You don't have to shit on somebody. You don't have to have this identity, you know, everybody could just relax. Then I think all of a lot of this striving and conflict and suffering, you know, just fucking falls away. Like it's so easy to say like that's a beautiful concept. You're worthy of love,

Speaker 5:          02:24:34       love. But I think people have to experience a certain amount of difficulty in their life just to exercise their system. I think our system is put in place to have a certain amount of obstacles to overcome and when we don't have any or when it's like really simple stuff that's fucking boring, you know? I think people have real problems with that. I think we have real problems with our minds, real problems physically with our entire unit. I think we absolutely need a certain amount of exertion, you know? And, and my, I mean in might not even be physical. Like, um, my friend drawn, drawn Horton and went to Colorado with him. We did a gig out there. He just got into chess just a madman. But the chest now playing on his phone, constantly moving things around and he's like, you want to play? I'm like, fuck that. I'm not getting sucked into that God damn rabbit hole. I see him there on the plane. Can't wait to play chess since we're off in the sky. I'll fucking with his

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       phone. Shit. That's uh, that is another discipline. I mean, they're all disciplines. They're all these different things that you try to seek truth through. I mean, chess is a form of combat, you know, it's just not painful, but it's most certainly, yeah, it's a form of combat. It's absolutely a form of, it's a contest. You know, if you treat it as a war, I mean that is essentially what you're doing. Like you're breaking it down to a very innocuous but very safe, but very obvious what's going on. I'm testing my intellect against your intellect and we're going to do it. Do so through a very established series of movements of these things are allowed to participate in. We have a, a established playing field. You know the rules. I know the real rules. I think I'm smarter than you go. And you have that little clock thing that those dudes to have those dudes, they fuck they fuck with you.

Speaker 1:          02:26:11       So they move it quick and then eat that fucking clock. Ooh. And you want to move a quick tool. You want to say fuck you bitch. I know that. Ah, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, clack. And you see them giving up pieces and moving fast. That's some mental war. They're playing a mental, some sort of a strategic conquest game. Yeah. And that's uh, and you know, that's one, like you said, that discipline, there's so many ways up the mountain, but you need a mountain. You need something. You need a mountain. I met. It doesn't, it's not mutually exclusive to, you know, the self love aspect. You can still find your mountain, you know, without thinking you're a piece of shit when you stumble because everybody fucking stumbles. It doesn't mean you're a piece of shit. It doesn't mean that you should hate yourself.

Speaker 1:          02:26:50       It doesn't mean that you should isolate yourself from the love of the world because you feel you're not worthy of it and is create these negative patterns like, yes, go out fucking fine your mountain. But when you stumble, like everybody fucking does understand that. That's just life. Like we're all going to stumble. You just get up and keep going. Maybe you bitch, I'm not stumbling. I got this thing I'm doing, Bro. I'm doing a lot of tight rope walking in the house. I got rope set up all around the house, Tyrell proc into the kitchen. I figured somebody could do it. I saw this thing. This dude lives in the mountains, just tight ropes to work. You mean someone tight ropes, right across these giant spaces. What w what's to stop people from just doing that all the time from creating like a civilization high up in the sky and if you fall down you're fucked.

Speaker 1:          02:27:33       So don't fall and uh, just tight rope because people love to drink. That's why that's a problem. That's why you got to get that psychedelic honey because it helps you tyrell better type room over to the psychedelic honeycomb. Snatch it while there you gotta stay calm while they're staying in the fuck out of you and you still in beehive stop. You ever tried, you ever gone skiing on mushrooms? You were telling me how awesome it is and I need to try it because I skiing to me is a, it's a weird thing. It's like I can do it but I'm always like the consequences of this like little bit of fun. It's really not worth it. Like I do it because my family likes to do it, but part of me is like, don't fall down bitch. Don't fall down bitch. Don't fall down bitch. Okay, here we go again. Don't fall down. Don't fall down.

Speaker 1:          02:28:17       I mean it's fun. I get it. And if I was better at it would probably be even more fun, but it's like, dude, I know too many people that have fucked their bodies up skiing. I mean fucked up, blown their neat cap up to the side of their hip and their fucking legs broken seven places and their next never moving to the left ever again and like, Whoa, what happened? I hit a tree. I'm one of the lucky ones. I think that's people. That's why people liked skiing and even why people like riding a motorcycle, it's like the stakes are high. When the stakes are high you have to focus on what you're doing then your present again. So it's fun. Yeah, you got to get better at it. That's what it is. Just coming up with bitch ass excuses, but it's, it's what's easier.

Speaker 1:          02:28:58       Snowboarding or skiing, skiing, I think really, at least for, at least for me when I've tried it snowboarding, the falls are way gnarlier because when you fall and you catch like your toe edge, like you slam back. Oh yeah. I've gotten, I hit my head so hard coming from a steep mountain down into a flat and caught an edge on this icy part. Oh, I hit the back of my head so hard that the front of my goggle lenses popped off into the air, like a fucking pop tart out of a toaster. All right. And I was fucked. Like I couldn't just, yeah. Yeah. Cause I woke up, people were like helpfully, like terrified helpfully, like you, okay. So that probably wouldn't happen to your skin, Huh? They can, but it's less likely because the way that you catch that edge and just like hook up the hookup, the board and it's like a slingshot and just slams your head back down.

Speaker 1:          02:29:50       We're skiing, you'll like usually skid out or tumble or, right. I mean, I'm one of those things. So yeah, I think the con, I mean that's why it makes it harder to learn because there's these fucking fatal crashes you do on a snowboard. Yeah. And skiing to men. Sometimes some people get too close to you, like that's another problem. Like they don't know how to control themselves. Very good. Yeah. And they're kind of like out of control. And so you have to kind of like adjust quickly to get away from them. Like, Oh shit. Like this lady was coming down like, ah, like it looked like she was going to go down hard, but she, she got by me, I'm like, Oh shit, I've got a ductus lady. And so I had to take a hard left, but then the trees are right there. I'm like, fuck, I gotta take a hard right and hope it ain't working.

Speaker 1:          02:30:30       Boom. When I started. But it was, I was fine, but I was like, Ooh, boy. Like that can go wrong if you're in the wrong spot when that happens. Like if there's a tree there and you cannot get away from that tree, like you gotta be real fucking careful who you zig and zag. I'll take that bitch out next time. Like if we're near a tree. Sorry Lady. We're both going down together hoping not to fall. Fucking good to say don't swerve for the deer. Ah, yeah. He's supposed to just hit the gas, right? No, no. He's supposed to not do anything. She was just let it hit your car, but that's ridiculous. That's like saying don't blink with someone, punches you. How many deers do you get to hit before you realize not to hit the gas like it takes? It would be like, like you ever seen a picture of Floyd Mayweather eating a jab? Like he's cutting a punch to the face but his eyes are wide open and he's punching back because he's so conditioned to being

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       punchy. So used to it that he can keep his eyes open as the punches are coming in and then counter perfectly. You're not going to have that kind of resolve with a deer. No. You're going to hit that break. Yeah, you're going to swerve good again when them giant fucking meat cleaver bumpers and they have like people live in Wyoming and shit. They have those road warrior bumpers and the trucks. It just makes different stakes cut and I'm like t bone and then it's like, it's like extruded like Plato. Yeah. You have to like some places you can't just throw it in the back of your truck either. You'd have to kind of call somebody and prove that you hit it that way cause they want to discourage poaching. That's it. Well it makes a lot of sense man. But fuck deer jumping in front of your car.

Speaker 4:          02:32:05       What are the odds that you're going to go, okay, you can't hit those brakes. Remember they said just don't swerve, just hit the deer. I think some people are better at that super calm moment of like decision making and crisis. Like I've been around people in certain situations that like are you can't prepare for. And then there's some people who just freeze like straight fucking freeze. Yeah. And then some people act and I think like all like off police officers and military, they train yourself past the freeze. But it's funny, like I was in Australia and this dude was drinking Bundaberg over proof rum and he was used to doing this trick with regular butter proof from, which is Bundaberg rum, where he lights it on fire and pours it in his mouth and it goes out when it hits his mouth. But he was doing it instead with over proof from right.

Speaker 4:          02:32:52       Was He never done before? Well, the thing was over proof from is that mother fucker doesn't go out ever period. Like the wind is not going to get it out. So he's pouring his flaming shot and it doesn't go out and so it's face catches fire. Oh Jesus. Full full on hell raiser face catches fire. He's in the kitchen of the house we're renting and like everybody is just looking at him, he's clawing and his face is not working. Obviously he doesn't know what to do. And then I'm looking at them and I don't know what the fuck to do and everybody's just staying there. So I go to the Faucet and I'm like trying to get water and like spray it on from the fall, not the right thing. I should have put like a towel or a roof over his head, you know, but you just don't think you're not prepared at that moment.

Speaker 4:          02:33:32       You know? And then, and then so eventually he fucking rolls around on the ground and gets it, get figured out. He got burned but it was more like a facial, like took the, took the first layer off and he had like a nice laser peel. Oh yeah. Like when someone goes does that and it doesn't say anything and you sort of go, okay, did you just visit the sun a little bit like that? He ended up ended up being fine but I've been around other people. Like another incident, it was like a home stripper pole. Right. And I was there with, I was there with Roger where ty. Right and how's you should never buy, I'm talking about a haunted house or your own poles alum superbad ago and it was, it was tied to the wall and this girl gets on there and she's swinging. She's a little bit bigger. We're all around the raw kind of laughing. Everybody's clothes were all just laughing and, and, and the pole goes

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       like on hinges from the roof. She's going timber from like 10 feet up inverted like it's going to be really bad. And literally everybody around the circle just looked like this is going to be bad. And Roger just quickly like immediately moves over and like grabs the Paul [inaudible] style. Right. And that's when I realized like that's a different dude. That's a dude that when that totally random thing happens, he has the ability to act instead of just look around like all of us dummies like damn, that's going to hurt. Yeah, it's a good point. That's hilarious. Well Rogers, the same guy that knocked out that fucking due to punch that girl in Austin. Yeah. That was a giant giant football player. Football player. This is when Roger was fighting in the UFC and he was, he's fighting it 155 pounds. It's not a big guy.

Speaker 2:          02:35:08       And this a football player who knows what the story was, walked up to some woman in, punched her in the face and I don't know in the back of the head. Yeah. What's, so they were coming out of a club and it was actually a club that we used to go to a lot. I just happened to be out of town that weekend, but we're kinda coming out of the club and this girl, like he gets the guy gets an f, like a fight with one of her boyfriends or whatever. And then she's like the whole thing because he punches a girl in the hedge whole the whole thing from the beginning. But no, you get us a little bit of red there. There you go. Here comes boom. Okay, watch this punches are right in the back of the head. Boom. And just flattens or, and then walks away and everybody's like, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          02:35:48       Yeah. And this guy is huge. And look at Roger. Roger walks up to him. He's literally a hundred pounds lighter than him. And I'm like, you're kidding. And Roger starts talking to him. He just says, at that point, you can't do that man. You can't do that, man. Wow. And so Roger Walks up and decides, okay, I'm taking my shirt off and takes his shirt off because he doesn't want to do to be able to grab his shirt like he's thinking strategically, like, which is like way one step ahead. It's not like he's going to physically intimidate this guy. The guy's giant. And so roger standing in front of this guy and the dude's big and it looks like somebody else tried to jump into somebody else, tried to jump in on both sides and stop them from fighting the guy that guy runs and then roger corners corners and by the truck, what you can't see you going on right now, corn is and by the truck, the guy swings, Roger Somehow gets a minute, muy Thai clinch and started kneeing him in the head and knees him in the head and then he gets them out of hosting and stomps him and then runs hold pride rules style.

Speaker 2:          02:36:47       And this all happens in 1520 seconds. Maybe not even. It was really quick, like, yeah, the whole video is only two minutes and 28 seconds long and it became this viral gigantic kit. Whatever happened to that dude. Did he get in trouble for that? Um, I don't know. I don't think so. I know that the police knew, obviously the roger hit him and they just basically shook his hand and we're like, yeah, hey, all right. We understand. You know. But, uh, I don't think anything ever happened to that dude. But that was fucking brutal and hard.

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       Just went full, full overhand right to the back of that chick's head. Yeah. But he's just that type of dude. He also saved somebody from drowning on the beach. Raj. Yeah. He's just like finds himself in situations and he acts, you know, whereas other people, you know, might freeze or might not. Well, he has a brutal upbringing, you know? And I think sometimes people that have overcome brutality when they're younger, they developed this ability to understand like, oh, I've been here before. I know what this is all about. I know what this kind of chaos is. And there's only one way out of this thing. You got to meet it head on where someone is coddled who grows up and you know, a cushion room. Everything. Everything's dolls, no sharp edges that that person when confronted with some horrific situation, like some giant steroids up, football player punches a girl in the back of the head and you've got to act and that guy's a hundred pounds bigger than you and Roger just takes the shirt off.

Speaker 1:          02:38:08       Right. It's just like, well I can't have him grab me. Yeah, that's the dude you don't wanna fuck with you. Sure. Unemotional dude. I really wished that that he didn't have that falling out with UFC. Yeah. People forget the Roger worked or was the first guy to ever be on the cover of sports illustrated for MMA. He was on the fucking cover of sports illustrated. He was being groomed as one of the top guys, but there was some sort of dispute between him and the UFC. Who knows which side is correct. Who knows what happened, but he wound up leaving the UFC and then, yeah, he just won his last fight so I have to do that. Is he in one now? Was he fighting over one RC? One FC. He's got some real talent, man. You know they've got, ben asked went over there, but I heard it's crazy. You know, he's got some real talent right now. The bell tour, welterweight division, Douglas Lema just knocked out chorus cough. You know that guy who a fucked up? Uh, um, uh, what the hell is his name?

Speaker 6:          02:39:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:39:01       What he, he's beaten a few guys. Let me think. Chorus. Cough. Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:39:05       MMM.

Speaker 1:          02:39:07       Oh fuck. Did he beat up? God dammit. What am I thinking of? Who Give me his uh, chorus cobb's last few. I know he fought Benson Henderson. He beat Benson Henderson up when Benson came over to, um, to tour and he fought as well to wait for the first time. And then a Benson just fought. You got it.

Speaker 1:          02:39:33       Oh, who, who, wait a minute. Why does it say Douglas Lema twice? Douglas. He was the opponent. Who's is this course cough? Oh, he lost a Doug Islam at twice. Are you one the first one lost the second one. The first one. Cause Cor de Lima had a fucked up knee. That's right. And then he'd beat Benson and then Lima just crushed him in the rematch. Which fight am I thinking of? Man? God, I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't remember which side it was, but the Benson Henderson one was a big one. Even though it was a decision, you could tell the difference in size is pretty significant. But then when Lima fought Korotkov, you could see Lima looked way bigger than Korotkoff. So they, and they've got Paul Daley. Okay. That's what it is. So Lima just, I'm getting all confused. Lima beat Paul Daley, who's super legit and he beat him

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       by decision and then just knocked out Korskoff I, for some reason I thought Lima are thought daily had fought Korskoff I fucked it up. But dailies Super Legit, I mean, dailies a scary fucking striker. Sure. So for Lima to beat him and to be Benson Henderson who's relatively undersized for the division and then to knock out Korotkoff like that, I mean that was stunning shit. I think he's world class. And uh, meanwhile that guy was ragdoll by Ben [inaudible] who is the one FC champ ragdolled. Both of them were Korotkoff cough and Lima Bolt Rag dog by aspirin. Aspen's a motherfucker, dude. Yeah. His minute. Then another level. Who, when did he lose? When did, uh, Douglas Lema lose to aspirin? Put Up Lima's record again cause uh, he did I fuck that up back in April, 2012. Yeah. See Lima's had some, uh, some serious injuries he's at. He had serious knee surgery, but uh, that was quite a few years ago.

Speaker 5:          02:41:11       But then ask her and did that to him. He did that. The korotkoff he, he's done that to a lot of dudes. He gets a of those guys and just, they look like world beaters until he gets a hold of them. You get two drags them lyman. Good. He did it. The lyman good too. Same thing. It gets all of them, dragged him to the ground, beats the fuck out of them. They can't get up. It's just crazy. And he's so relaxed. When I saw him do that to somebody, he's like riding. I'm like a bowl, like waving to the crowd. People are booing. He doesn't care. He doesn't give a fuck. It's crazy. I mean, I, it's one of my most a perplexing puzzles in mma, but he fought when he fought in, um, Bella tour when Jay Hiran went over there, Jay Heran gave him a hell of a fight and Jay Heron, who was a very good fighter who didn't do so good in the UFC, but it was really talented and then went over and had this fight with a acronym.

Speaker 5:          02:42:06       Beltour. I mean, Jay Heran was, um, you know, a good wrestler with a little bit better crisper striking than aspirin and magic. Keep it on the feed lot and ask her, had a real problem with that. So that was one of those things where I was like, man, I want to see him against world class fighters, know how to stop that take down against a real good wrestler. And those that have stuff to take down who's his size? But Michael Chandler just beat, uh, um, Benson Henderson too. They've got real talent over there now, no doubt. But it's still one of those things where nobody watches it. It's like you look at the ratings, it's like they're lucky they get a few hundred thousand well it's the human, it's the human drama that people love, you know the, and the bigger that personality, the more it's a celebrity of the more interested you are in the fight. You know, like you get to understand this character that conor mcgregor is and it's part of the compelling nature of watching the fight. Like the personality people want to identify with it. It's like some, I think it's the difference between a good epic movie and a Shitty epic movie, like a good epic movie. You Fall in love with the characters before the fucked up stuff happens that propels them on their hero's journey. You know, you can't just go straight out of the gate and show that that whole backstory happen and then

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       he's all of a sudden kicking ass like you want to be emotionally invested in. Then every time they're swinging know, swinging a sword or every time you're watching them punch and take down your way more invested. And I think boxing did that with 24 seven the UFC has done that with all of their embedded, and I think that's just something that they do better than anybody else. They get you emotionally invested into the fighter and then when you're there, you know that's when, that's when you really want to watch. There's also those epic personalities, those mega personalities that come around around every few generations or once a generation or a couple of times a generation, I should probably say like the Tyson's or the sugar ray Leonard. So the people that people were just so compelled to watch, and connor is just one of those people.

Speaker 1:          02:43:54       If he was inboxing and having the same sort of success, he'll be just as big. He'd be gigantic if triple g had his personality and my God, Oh my God, I mean Jesus Christ. But triple g's not doing things the way connor's doing things. Not even close because connor has those little gloves on and you know, he's fighting mma, he's, he's landing these one shots like that. Just stunned guys and have them rocked and he's putting them away like he's got lead in his hands. Sort of a different thing. Like you see his fight with Josie Aldo that you very rarely see that happen. 13 seconds in a world championship boxing match where someone connects with one shot flatline. Somebody that's in the realm of MMA almost exclusively in early fights like that. It's so rare than in a championship fight. Someone knocked someone dead in 13 seconds, but in the UFC can happen all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:44:45       I mean it just fucking happens. There's a lot less armor on that button on the lights out button. Yeah, less padding in there. A lot harder to defend to. It's easier to defend with those big gloves. Yeah. There's so much going on with big gloves versus small gloves. You see guys that have devoted their whole life to big glove defense and then they come in in the small gloves just don't offer the same sort of protection. Even look at Nicky Hoskins, main defense. He gets in that kind of turtle posts where he pretty much is covering everything. That's super important. You know, in his head with his gloves and forearms and Yup. Can't do that with a little gloves. No you can't. But see, that's one of the cool things about watching a guy like holt skins that he can do that like with the big gloves, like, oh look, we can do here.

Speaker 1:          02:45:26       Right. You can't hit that guy. Well, he uh, did you ever see his fight with Raymond Daniels? Two fights. Walks him down, man. Just beats the legs up, walks him down. Starts beating the fuck out of him. Yeah. Just absorbs those shots. Keeps Chop Chop chopping away. He's a bad mother fucker, dude. There's a bunch of those guys now. I just, uh, I just hope that it gets the attention that it deserves because these guys are, you know, they're really risking their health in such a dramatic way. Well, Whitney's working for glory now. I saw Holla at miss two jets. I saw that this is going to Germany. We were in, um, we were in here and Joe Schilling and Eve Edwards and I did a glory fight companion and we're like, oh shit. I look away. And if

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       your mother fuckers does, she like it. She likes it. It's um, you know, just I, for some reason I don't know what the reason is, but for some reason it's just never completely like took root in America. But it's not because of the talent. I think it's, again, you got to tell the stories, you know, that's what people want. You need to have invest way more in the, in the pre fight, you know, video crew. It's putting out these videos or get a reality TV show. So I think that's a genius thing that the UFC did. Cause you're exposing people to the personality of these characters and then when you watch him fight, you care. That's the fucking missing piece. It's not, I think they're always looking at how can we improve the actual sport you got to improve. You know, the people's access inside these combatants.

Speaker 2:          02:46:58       And I think that's the, that's the key. You don't. Another thing, it doesn't seem like there's a number, like a venue that is anything even remotely like the venues that used to exist just like 10 years ago as far as like putting a fight on showtime or putting a fight on hbo or putting a fight on NBC seems like 10 20 years ago you could've put Moitai on NBC at nine o'clock at night at some crazy Moitai night and people would have got hooked. Like, Whoa, this is nuts. But now it seems like there's so many options for entertainment. It's really difficult to like lock in a substantial group of people just by putting something on a certain time at night. Like they have so many choices. Yeah, there's almost too many choices where almost like overrun with possibilities to stare into the looking glass and get chanted.

Speaker 2:          02:47:44       You know? It's true. And, but I think ultimately that's our salvation. You know, you get all of the choices and then, then you can really decide what you want. You know, I think we're going to be robots. This is what I told him. I really, not just robots were that. Anyways. I think that's the cool part about westworld is it's showing that like where his robot, whereas consciousness, at what level, and I think we're just a more complicated version of that. Yeah, man, don't spoiler alert. I haven't seen the last episode. Yeah, I haven't seen the last ones next week. That's okay. I've seen all of them up till now. I'm caught up, but a lot of people listening aren't, yeah. Yeah. I think before that ever happens before there's a place where you can go and interact with robots. You're going to be one. I think it's going to be way more likely that you're going to take people that have been injured, like soldiers that have lost a limb in a war, they're gonna replace it with better limbs than the first person is going to offer to get their limbs cut off.

Speaker 2:          02:48:37       It's probably gonna be someone with a disease where the limbs don't work so well. They get them cut off and then they win the Olympics. Just start jumping over buildings and shit. Next thing you know, everybody's like, why don't have these regular legs? And then one day it's going to get to a point where you can take your whole brain, take that brain sticking into fuck another body. I think it's not necessarily the brain. I think it's whatever that that thing that we call consciousness, maybe that originates from the brain. Maybe it's something something separate, but the transfer of consciousness, that's one of those archetipal stories like a religious story. The the shape shifter like you find in so many cultures, someone who can transfer their consciousness to another vehicle. I think that's definitely going to happen. Like we're going to be able to transfer our consciousness into other things that can hold that level of complexity.

Speaker 2:          02:49:21       You know, like as long as it can hold that level of complexity. Like I think trying to transfer our consciousness into a stinkbug would be really challenging. Obviously the brain and how it worked, it's too, it's putting something that's too big and something too little, but if something is of, you know, similar complexity, I think we could transfer our consciousness into there. We just got to figure out what consciousness is, how you know, how we measure it. Somewhere in between the spaces of quantum physics or maybe that's the frontier. Maybe it's somewhere, but how we transfer that I think will ultimately figure out, and I think we know it and I think that's why it's in all these stories. They're going to work. Yeah. They're going to have conversations with people. They say, hey man, don't worry about it. We made a copy of your brain so it doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          02:50:00       We just put you back in your own body. Yeah. Like, oh cool, you made a coffee. Yeah. I mean it's copy from November 21st, 2016 do not worry. Everything from here back. You're not going to remember anything from today, but it's no big deal, man. You're going gonna lose a couple of days of shit going on and you catch up, get on your twitter or the top trending. Just objects, just rides and it goes out a body for a little while, stays current, and then just drops back in. Well, now you're talking crazy. I don't know why he of thing to the next level. I just feel like we're going to come to a point where we figure out how to express ourselves outside on language. This is what I believe. I believe that the intention, like pure intention, we're going to be able to broadcast that through some form of third party software, hardware solution, whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          02:50:46       Like there'll be able to figure out what the actual intention of a thought is and transmit that and so instead of a sentence, it will be a series of thoughts that you can transfer the intention where you know it without language. You don't have to have a comprehension of German to be able to communicate with a person from Germany because you'll be able to see whatever they're thinking in pure intent or feel it or know it or whatever the fuck it is. And that's so much closer to truth than language, which is always just an approximation. It's just a symbol for an idea. Whereas if you could express in pure intent, you know like just the feeling of it and I think that's also what you experienced sometimes in in the psychedelic state. You feel what you would think is God and you can't fucking describe it.

Speaker 2:          02:51:30       All of the words fail. Nothing that makes sense when you're actually talking about it, but you feel it. And the intent of that thing is there and then you just approximate it and approximate it until it's almost gets ridiculous. And it is ridiculous because you can't put that into words, you know? But you feel that and you only way you really have a reference if you'd experienced it as well. Like you're saying this and I'm like, I'm listening to you say this and I agree with you. And then I'm like, man, how would I describe it any differently to somebody? And I'm like, well, let's see what we got here for tools. Oh, they don't exist. There's no tools in the toolbox that allow you to explain like a really heavy duty breakthrough dmt trip did. They don't exist. Like you can try to approximate it, but you sang it.

Speaker 2:          02:52:13       I register it. But it's only because I have what I believe to be a similar experience to what you've experienced. And even that, it's just guesswork. Yeah. And I'm assuming you're explaining, you're explaining to me what went down when you had it. And I'm like, well that sounds a lot like how I would clumsily trying to explain my experience but we don't know and you don't know. Don't know. And that's why we should go out and look for yourself, you know, feel these things, see these things, experience these things. But when you see burning man, when you go to a place like burning man and you see what's possible, I mean obviously I haven't been, but you've been a few times when you see what's possible. When these fucking freaks I'll get together and rewrite the rules and go crazy. It gives you a lot of hope.

Speaker 2:          02:52:53       It really does because it makes you realize like these are a lot of people with normal people around us and yet they're choosing in this one moment to behave in this stark contrast to everyday culture and society. But there's no litter. People are friendly with each other to give it away food. Like they're only doing it for short bursts. You know, they're doing it for a week at a time. Once a year, but they're doing it. They're still doing it. And they didn't do it 30 years ago. It didn't do it 50 years ago. They're doing it now and they're doing it in one spot, but we're talking about it and people were starting to get together and they go, well let's, we could do this more often. Like we can do something similar to this more often proves the concept because it changes your view of how an interaction with a stranger could be.

Speaker 2:          02:53:38       It not somebody who's trying to take something from you and fuck you up, fuck up your energy, whatever. Like you're all in it together in some weird way. And obviously their shit heads at burning man too. But you'd get the overwhelming consensus that you're all in it together. And it's a, it's a cool, cool feeling. Just transcends these kind of very solid cystic. I'll, I mean, I would even for myself, these are my things, this is my fortress that I build and you just collapse all that and, and surrender to a much, much happier state. And that's part of the magic. I mean, isn't that one of the more genuine problems with any sort of egalitarian or more altruistic vision is that people are not going to reciprocate. Like, you know, like if you could find a like minded group of people where instead of the mob mentality going fucking crazy and grabbing swords and chopping each shop each other out, there's the mob mentality of peace and love.

Speaker 2:          02:54:30       We're all just sort of everybody around you sort of adopted this thing. You know it really radical way that we're in fucking goggles and riding bikes everywhere and everything's lit up a solar power and you're like, Whoa, these people are going deep with this. Like everybody's embraced this, so there, so all in every fucking chip is on the table when you're out there that it reinforces this different and very peculiar sort of mob mentality that's psychedelic trip and, and, and happy, you know, and that that's possible too. Like while we're watching mass rape in India, you hear about these horrible instances where these men rape women on trains. Like what the fuck is going on over there? While that's happening, Bernie man's happening. Yeah. It's like there's another, there's another sort of mob consciousness that can erupt when it's considered carefully applied ethically, morally, sensitively with an open heart.

Speaker 2:          02:55:25       Like that can be done to like, there's a bunch of different states. Again, you apply to who, you know, a human goes into an environment with love and radical acceptance. True in in the truest sense. You're going to more adapt to that. Whereas you get in these systems of fear and control, you know, you're going to adapt to that. And I think anybody that we encounter, we have that choice of what we're going to give back to them and turn that tide. And maybe it won't be reciprocated, but it can also stop the, it can stop that trend. So if someone really, you know, if they do something fucked up, you know, and you can't prevent it and you have to accept it and move on except that with love, show that person love and not this desire for justice and revenge and you'll start to switch the pattern.

Speaker 2:          02:56:05       You know, you'll, that's the only thing that ends the cycle. The only thing that ends the cycle ultimately as love, like violence, you know, you get something violent to you, then you do something violent to them, then you do something violent to you. And it continues to go until one person just holds like, man, I see your pain, I see where you're coming from. I see you as me. You know, I'm sorry you've had been driven to that state. I'm going to love you no matter what. And then all the sudden that person's like, what the fuck? And then it can end that cycle. And I think that's what we gotta do in, in society. That's where we got to do the right and the left, instead of continually shooting these barbs at each other. At some point the conscious people have to say like, you know, whatever you say, I hear you.

Speaker 2:          02:56:45       I don't necessarily agree. Here's my point of view, but I'm going to love you. I'm going to love you as if you were me. And then that ultimately ends it. But as long as we're just lobbing fucking hand grenades at each other, what fault? Sounds like a bunch of hippy bullshit that trump's gonna make a legal, that's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking he's throwing people in jail for burning the flag. We're taking it old school again, folks, old school, you know, uh, the fake Tan that he uses is, uh, from, uh, he takes a native American graves and the, uh, he takes the soil and that's what they use for the fake Tan is the only way to get it that perfect cue, but you can't get it too close to your eyes, hence the raccoon look. But it empowers you. It gives you energy and such a great supervillain move. He just needs it. Move trump tower, inactive volcano, move trump tower to an Indian burial site, put a trump tower up right where the Dakota pipeline is being built. One trump tower and just show the, or just show redskins games were wearing a red hat. Make America great again. What the fuck, ma'am? Hmm. Strange Times Change Times, but beautiful times. They're the best times they are. And the more we realized that the best times, the more we're going to be okay. Like right now. Yeah. It is entirely possible. We might get hit

Speaker 5:          02:58:02       by an asteroid the size of China. It is entirely possible. There are out there, there's giant chunks of the world rather was at one point time hit with another planet that's established. That's what they believe. They believe the moon was created when the earth, we nearly collided with another fucking planet that did sleek. It's not happening right now though, so right now it's just be nice to each other and have some fucking fun. Totally. Let's go champ.

Speaker 2:          02:58:32       Yeah, man. If we can always figure out shit to worry about, we can figure out all of these things to stress us out. It's our job. It's our relationship. It's the fucking media. If he's long as you enjoy the now, you're not going to regret it. If I go back and talk to my younger self like, hey young Aubrey, if I could tell you one fucking thing, it's to stress less like, yeah, think about the possibilities, but then let it go. Like enjoy your time because all there is is the enjoyment of time. You know all of these goals you have, they're all false summits. Like enjoy the whole process all the way through. Enjoy to that last moment where the fucking Chinese size asteroid smashes into, enjoy up to that last minute and you won't have any regrets. Yeah. If you can prevent it, do that. But if you can't do anything, don't fucking stress. Relax.

Speaker 5:          02:59:14       Yeah. And then even realize that like goals, they actually help you be happy. As weird as it seems like achieving goals and going after things and showing yourself that through discipline and focus, you can achieve these weird creative ventures. Take things to new places.

Speaker 2:          02:59:30       Yeah. It's the going for the competitor. It's the going for the goal. That's the best part. It's not the actual achievement of that goal makes you feel suddenly different. It's that you're striving for making progress and then you hit it and there's that. Of course that satisfaction, but then you set another goal. Yeah. You know, and then you set another goal and just know that you'll constantly be setting goals. So if at no point you're ever happy, unless you're achieving the goal, you're only going to be happy if fractional part of time, unless you're with that transformer. Watch getting his dick sucked over the Atlantic elude. You knew too. He probably has those cheesy limo lights inside of his jet where they change colors all the time. It's like purple, green, red, yellow. And he's in there with a bottle of Stoli activate an eagle feather, supervised Agora and Gorge Dick. We're just got so much viagara system has ears are ringing. He hasn't breathe through his nose a days. He uses coke to open up his nose so that he can breathe out of his nose while his deck as hard as titanium. Anything else? Nope. Shanice for me. Um, you want to talk about your Iowasca experience or how long would that take? I mean, that's a, it's a good 15 minute story and fuck it man. People are driving right now. They're like, keep going, keep going. Oh, let's, let's, let's set this up.

Speaker 5:          03:00:52       Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:00:53       Last time I talked to you after you had an Iowasca experience, you were like, dude, I think I'm done. Yeah, I think I'm done. Yeah. It almost

Speaker 1:          03:01:00       done. He's like, I don't, I think I'm good. Maybe some little dmt trips here and there, but I think I'm done. And then next thing I know you're off to the fucking jungle again. Let's go champ.

Speaker 4:          03:01:12       Exactly. That's called change. What happened? Well, one of the things that I enjoy is taking people who haven't experienced it and going there with them going like, there's no better rite of passage bonding experience. So this time I just brought all of my homies, like everybody in my inner circle that I love that wanting to go, you know, we all went. And um, so for me it's a lot about that kind of rite of passage experience. I still really like and appreciate the plants and I learned a ton and I sometimes underestimate how much more I have to learn from the plants for sure. I don't think so. It was a combination of that. Um, so anyway was set up this trip. Everybody I know we're going to do Iosco we're meeting Don Howard, who's, you know, we've done two documentaries with him now. Latest Iowasca documentary is with him as well.

Speaker 4:          03:01:56       Awesome guy. He's like Gandalf, the white wizard. So we're setting that up, but I knew this one was going to get interesting because a month, about a month before, sometime in August, I wake up in the middle of the night, we're going in September. I wake up in the middle of the night and um, from a dream and in this dream I look over and to my left side, I see this demon head and this gnarly looking demon head nosferatu looking thing. And he was just looking away and in my dream, he looks at me, it's fairs at me dead in the eye and goes, I'm going to kill you on September 23rd. Oh Shit. Like super fucking specific, right? So I wake up and I'm a little freaked out. I was like, damn, that was specific. So I go to my, and I knew my Peru trip was over that time. I go to the calendar of events, the itinerary and that night is the night we're drinking IOWASCA for the first time cause we were doing what Chuma afterwards.

Speaker 4:          03:02:45       So September 23rd was the night we're doing our WASCO. And so do you start thinking your mind was fucking with you? Like for sure. Like this is just your setting yourself up for a fall. Yeah, I played out all the scenarios. Right. And I'd try to like what was that? Maybe it was a metaphor. Maybe. Hopefully it wasn't for real. Hopefully you know, but, and you know I, maybe I might've known that date in my head, so I'm not trying to think this is supernatural. It's all kind of metaphor. But it was very specific. So by the time we get out there, I knew that I had this feeling like, man, some shit's going to come up here. Cause that was like something's in my psyche that's incredibly specific about this. So we're going into ceremony. And one thing I like to do to prepare for ceremony, and I do this for the whole group, is they do a meditation where it anchors them to their consciousness. And I put that consciousness in their heart, right? So cause the head can get really squirrely and you can get lost in belief in different ideas and thoughts. And if you identify yourself as consciousness, which I, I tell them to symbolize is a brilliant piece of white light in your heart and you symbolize that and you imagine that, that there, that's an anchor. That's like your anchor, that's your anchor to home. And then, you know, I, I talked to him how, when you imagine that there, then you can imagine it actually showing up. Atomically

Speaker 3:          03:03:58       like in, in the rules of quantum physics, the observer effect, you observe it, then it's connected to yourself, all yourselves connected to all things in space, connected to the, you know, to the one source of consciousness, the collective consciousness, that thing. And it just kind of anchors you and keeps you in this feeling of safe. So whatever's squirly things happening in your mind, you do that. But this is important for the story that I'm, that I'm setting up. Cause you know, so I do that meditation and that's where I go into the psychedelic experiences, anchored to my heart, connected to the cosmos, connected to the infinite through that. And it's a very kind of comforting, comforting meditation to do. So I'm going through and um, I take the medicine and right off the bat it's like super, you know, it's super chill. Like I'm seeing beautiful scenes like flowers, these flowers of light.

Speaker 3:          03:04:45       And I get this message like, hey man, it's this, this, this one's going to be easy. And I was like, oh, okay, cool. And is like, we're just going to fix a few things. So I felt like what it feels like all these little doctors of light, the doctor, Cheetos, you know, these little light beings, good going through my body and start fixing little different areas, fixing little parts in my head and they're fixing little parts here. And meanwhile my mind is being distracted with flowers and butterflies and it's super chill. The only memorable vision I had was I go to this shrine in this jungle and I see this giant monkey human hybrid that's super happy and it's like they're just butterflies and everything going around. And then in scripted in stone it says we are the pleasure monkeys and that's what have been, have been using that word today and has this like really cool thing like Oh yeah, we are pleasure monkeys, we're here to enjoy all of the best shit that we can.

Speaker 3:          03:05:34       And I start thinking about, you know, the foods and the people and the camaraderie and everything around me. Super Positive. Meanwhile the light's going through my body and fixing it and then you know, as this really idyllic thing and I think we're at an hour and a half and I'm like, fucking, we're good. Like whatever. This demon was not going to worry about it. It's fine. And then right to my left, I see this gnarly looking Gollum, Lord of the Rings Looking fucking my precious knows fraud to demon guy. And he looks at me and, and I was like, you know, one of the practices that I have is anchoring to that point in my heart. You know, I, I, you know, I encourage the feeling of invincibility. Like he can't be harmed, you know, this is your consciousness. It's this peace in your heart. It can't be harmed. And I see this demon and it looks at me and then it jumps, jumps towards me and it starts biting my neck.

Speaker 3:          03:06:26       Whoa. In my vision. Right? So it's gnarly looking demon is biting my vision. No, it's all like, it's all in this like a movie of me being played out. Right. I think you just going with, but the emotion ratchet it up, right? So at this point, you know, I know it's eating in my, you know, in that vision, it's eating through my neck and I see what it's aim is and it's aiming to eat through my neck and eat that thing in my heart. The white light in my heart that I've been meditating about. Like that's what it wants. So in, in what I thought was this like heroic act of invincibility, I was like, go ahead man, you want that thing? Go ahead. Eat all the way through me. Get that thing, it's fine. You know? Instead of, cause I've learned in a lot of these practices, the more you resist these things, the more aggressive they become and the harder you just get in this, this dance.

Speaker 3:          03:07:15       So it was more you surrender generally the better off you are. So it's like, oh you want to eat that thing, go for it. So it goes through each through my neck, through my chest, and it grabs a hold of that piece of white light in my heart, snatches it. And right at that moment I've never felt more free. I feel like I got shot with a bullet. Like I felt like I went dead completely dead and fear just shot through my entire body and I was like, Oh fuck, I just gave this demon my consciousness. I just gave this team in my soul and I let them have it. It's like all the fucking vampire movies, like they can't come in unless you give them permission, then you give them permission and all of these fucking thoughts are going through my head. And meanwhile I felt completely dead, like hollow from the inside.

Speaker 3:          03:07:57       Fear was that like 1000% and then the eco rows of the sham and start getting more intense. And I'm like, Holy Shit, I'm fucked. So I started negotiating with this nosferatu demon guy and I was like, man, I'd really like to get my piece back. Like you mind giving it back. Like, you know, it's all good. I understand you have your place, you know, for polarity to exist, there needs to be the dark that needs to be the light, you know, it's all good man. We're all on the same team. Ultimately we're all, you know, consciousness and the cosmos, he's having none of it. Right. And then finally, is he like he's, yeah, he's sometimes talking back and sometimes just kind of like mocking me really like kind of laughing and then he goes, here you go. And it gives me something, and I greedily like a, like a hungry, like a hungry child, like grab it.

Speaker 3:          03:08:37       And I stuffed it in my heart and it was dead piece of rock, like a dead stone. And it's just this demons just laughing at me. Now I have your heart and watch where I'm going. And he goes and he takes it and I'm following him and he, and you know, through this kind of like wormhole thing and he takes it and I see who he's giving it to and then I go, oh fuck. Because he's giving it to the demon of all demons. And this is very archetypical and I'm not religious, but these archetypes are coming through in this kind of, you know, demon, demon, Kibo type of sense. But anyways, this demon that he gives it to, I can only call the world crusher because literally he's of the size where I'm seeing him hold planets and crushing them into dust in his hands.

Speaker 3:          03:09:20       And he's just moving the cosmos. These giant horns made of this deep, dark black and red smoke and just laughing in the ecstasy of destruction as he takes galaxies and he rips them apart like the ultimate black hole of destruction and evil. And I go, fuck, like that guy's got my heart piece now. I like the little demon gave it to that thing. So I'm thinking like, what the fuck do I do? I can't even communicate with his demon world crusher. Like there's no way, there's no way I can even talk to him. He's too big. So I try to like, well maybe I can blow myself, you know, maybe I can get bigger. I'm thinking like video game style, like that's going to work. Like maybe if I fucking get bigger than we can talk and negotiate and I'll be on his level. Totally doesn't work.

Speaker 3:          03:10:03       I can't get even near the size of him and my vision. So I'm like, fuck, what the fuck do I do? Like what am I going to fucking do here? And, and I get the idea, I was like, man, I can't fight this thing. There's no way. But you know, understanding that again, that the consciousness in the cosmos needs dark and light. I understand the value of the polarity of that something that dark, you know, I understand that that's necessary. It's like, man, I got to send this thing love. So I go and I imagine floating up to its head and right between its eyes, I kissed him on the forehead and it's, I know it sounds weird and for a moment I see his eyes go google the eyes, like the Emoji heart thing where the heart's appeared, crushers eyes. And it was really kind of cartoony.

Speaker 3:          03:10:51       And um, for that moment he relinquishes and he's like, you know, I can give this back to you, but we never took it. No one can take that piece of your heart. It's yours. You know, it's impossible to steal unless you believe it can steal. And it was just like beautiful wisdom. And I was like, oh my God, thank God. But I was still like shaken up by that, you know, I was still kind of fucked up, but that move worked. And in that moment where his eyes were all googly hard, she was like, man, we can't take that from you. That's your, so I had this renewed sense of confidence and so I started kind of going, it was kind of more peaceful then it grows, seem to be falling. My trip died down. I'm going through about all the relations in my life and the different, you know, kind of doing the general work you do on Iowasca and I get to, I'm a member of my family who's really suffering from some mental illness is really dark, like a dark mental illness.

Speaker 3:          03:11:39       And I think that now maybe the world crusher, my friend. So I get the feeling of the world crusher has that element of darkness is in him. So I think in my imagination and, and kind of call back on that, on that being, and immediately it comes up but in a different shape, like a giant fucking sea serpent. And it's wrapping these tentacles around my body, like a Leviathan from the deep and, and, and I'm like, whoa. I was like, um, what do you think about maybe letting you know this, this family member, what do you think about letting him go? And he's like, you want his soul? I'll make a trade your soul for his. And I was like, fuck, fuck that. Fuck that. Right. So, so at that point I was like, man. And then I was like, I don't think I can make that trade.

Speaker 3:          03:12:26       He's like cower. And you wouldn't do that for someone you love. You're a coward. I thought you said you were invincible and starts mocking me. Clearly not my homie. Like clearly take the world crashed, takes his job seriously. So eventually I have to go like, you know what, that's between you and him. I can't step in there like there's nothing that I can do for you. So I just had to let it go and I let them go. Not Making that proverbial deal. And again, I don't think this is like really happening. This could just be an archetype, right? Of course. But so anyways, from there I was like, fuck man, this is turned super dark. Like, can I get some help? Like in since the archetype was demons, I was like, can I get a Jesus in here? Something like some kind of light and nothing light would come.

Speaker 3:          03:13:06       Although I did get a cool vision of like Jesus meeting the world crusher and I was like, Ooh, this is going to be squared like showdown UFC ultimate Jesus versus the world crusher. And immediately they turned super gay and they started making out with each other and having sex. Jesus in the world crusher started like having sex with each other and it was so, it was the wildest vision cause it was this like the ultimate love affair, like the two polarities of the cosmos, like all of the love and forgiveness and all of the power. Who was the destruction. The pack in darkness was the top, the doctor's bag of Jesus. Jesus would turn, he was man woman. It was like super. He could be whatever he wanted, but they were dancing in this like passionate love affair, which was like all creation. So Jesus became man and woman, Jesus man, woman.

Speaker 3:          03:13:53       He was just, it was just like love versus power and darken and destruction. Creation versus structured like the two polarities dancing but expressed as the world crusher is devil like creature. And then Jesus, you know, which started as kind of Jesusy and then went and a woman and then went into man, whatever it was, at least gave me a chuckle. And it was like a moment of like relief from this really fucking heavy trip. But I still wasn't getting any personal interaction from anything on the light side, you know? And so I'm still like kind of a little shaken up, especially after, you know, the world crusher called me a coward and I couldn't help you know, this person in my family and it's like, fuck. Um, so then I see this, I keep trying to reach out to like the helpers, like something from the light and I get this very faint message.

Speaker 3:          03:14:38       You know, sometimes the visions are super clear and sometimes they're faint. It feels like you're, you're kind of reaching for it. But I'll go with that. I'll use my imagination is a bridge, so I kind of go with it. It's like, here we have this thing for you and put it in your heart. It'll give you extra, you know, it'll be what you're looking for. And is this brilliant? Ruby like redstone, right? It's brilliant. Ruby stone. And I was like, Oh wow, that's beautiful. Like I always imagined the thing in my heart being white but red. All right, it's cool. I put it in my chest and then instantly I could feel myself getting this like hunger for power and feeling like the world crusher, like I wanted to destroy and manipulate and I was like, Oh shit, that's not the thing. You know, that's not, that wasn't a real gift that was getting tricked again.

Speaker 3:          03:15:23       So I pull this thing out of my heart and for sure like I can just feel the evil emanating from it, right? And I can hear the distant laughter, the world crusher, like, ha ha ha fooled you again. You accepted this stone. And so I have this ruby stone in my vision. I'm like, what the fuck am I going to do with this? All right, so I have this place that I've developed in my meditation. It's like a little hat. It's like my happy place, right? It's place. I go and I imagine it in my mind, it's like my happy place. So I was like, all right, I'm gonna put my stone in my place and I'm gonna leave it there in my, in my vision. Why put it there and the happy place and it turns to fucking like swamp and bog and everything.

Speaker 3:          03:15:58       All the trees are withering like you see in one of those fantasy movies where the darkness anchors into a place and all the life dies around. And I was like, fuck man, I can't put it there. It's going to destroy this, this world I created. It's like I bring it back and I was like, I hear this voice, like just put it in your heart. You can hold it. You're strong enough to hold it. So like, okay, yeah, maybe my heart is the only place I can put it. It's the only way it's gonna be safe. Put it back in there. Bad idea. Obviously that was another trick. But I'm really getting shaken here because I keep getting fucking tricked and I keep not knowing what my mind is telling me that's helpful or whether it's coming from something else. So eventually I would like move it out of my body and I'm looking at it, I was like, fuck.

Speaker 3:          03:16:38       The only way that I can get rid of this is to dissolve it evenly across the entire spectrum of creation. Right? Take this and dissolve it into the all so that the entire game, all of good, all of bad, everything can hold this amount of evil. It's too concentrated for any one thing to hold. I got to dissolve it. And I tried that move with my imagination and it worked. Boom. And the red stone dissolves. And then all of creation holds that darkness and that power. And I'm sitting there and I just, at this point just fucking surrender. Like I've just been totally getting my ass kicked, you know, for the majority of this trip. And especially just having been tricked and, and I'm just kind of like in a state of surrender. And at that point I feel like kind of like iron man style, I feel this like breastplate, like come slap onto my chest and it has this really beautiful fire opal stone.

Speaker 3:          03:17:30       And this thing is helmet come on, my head pink and his helmet comes and it has this other brilliant white light and I feel wings shoot out from my back. Right. And it's obviously, it's, I lost, it's shit's crazy. And, and I'm flying in the air and there's a bunch of like eagles and other birds and it's all like peaceful and all good. And it was like all of the allies, like all of the good guys, all the good team Kinda came through and they were flying over this world that was dark and fires and pollution and chaos. And they were just bringing this like fresh air of like white light. And I was just cruising. And so for the last 30 minutes of the trip, I was just literally like flapping my wings in division, just Kinda cruising over the world with all my ego.

Speaker 3:          03:18:14       Homeys and, and it was fucking one of the GNARLIEST, obviously experiences I've ever had. No doubt. That's why it's illegal. But your speech is going to be used in the Senate. They're going to get together with Congress. They got to play this speech back. This is a successful guy, folks. Look what he's doing. Yeah. It goes down with the God damn jungle fighting world crushers and Jesus's Gay. Do you want Jesus to be, you want that? Oh Geez, give me a woman. Jesus can be a man. He can be a woman. He's gender fluid. Yup. Wow. And tense. And again, I think the lessons necessary, it's really just about, that was the type of resistance that could summon the very best out of me. You know, the move to move to show the world, Krush her love the move to, you know, all of the moves that I had to make.

Speaker 3:          03:19:05       I was only able to learn about myself from the extreme pressure of that vision. And that's one of the beautiful parts of the IOWASCA vision. It tends to give you just enough that if you show up with your best and you and you choose, you know, choose love and you choose the, the things that are going to bring out the best outcome, you'll make it through, but it, but it brings you to that very fucking brink where it feels like, man, you know, the stakes are really, really high. It's interesting because I think stories like that

Speaker 5:          03:19:33       and experiences like yours, although you've got to go somewhere to experience them legally, the those stories are what people are going to rely. That's like almost like a road map of the potential experiences that people are gonna come back with and go to, dude, look what he's saying about this. Do you want it? Do you want to go there? Do you want to go? How do we get there? You got to go over the mountain. You go over the mountain to meet the world crusher. Fuck man. Okay. He definitely came back. Yeah, he's back, man. He's in Austin. He's hanging out. Yeah. Like one day, all this stuff is going to be legal and one day all sorts of psychedelic experiences, whether it's masculine or fucking mushrooms, whatever, they're all going to be really commonplace. They're going to be as commonplace is going to get a massage or it's common places, you know, taking a yoga class.

Speaker 5:          03:20:19       Just right now we're in a weird place where someone like you tell him that story seems like a crazy person. Yeah. You know, even talking to me who's experienced a bunch of shit, you know, and I've experienced a bunch of shit with you. I mean, I know you're not, I mean you're not crazy. You're just relaying this very odd thing that very few people who are ever going to be able to relate to right now, but one day, one day it'll be real common and I think it's more common now. I think when you, you saying this now way more common, do you talk about Iowasca and people understand what you're saying then? Just 10 15 years ago, you know?

Speaker 3:          03:20:52       Oh, no doubt. Because people have had similar experiences of reference. I mean, I think the way that a lot of people experience this is in archetypes that you learn about and there's a different character in the story. You know, which something you can learn from like the Harry Potter movies, like, uh, like Jordan was talking about, you know, you can learn from those archetypes, but it's different when you know, you get a chance to play as the main character playing is the main character. It gives you a whole different series of lessons. Like none of these themes that came up, you know, our original themes, these are all deep archetypes. Even fucking the Lord of the ring, like the stone, it was a stone of such evil. How does it be destroyed? It destroyed in the fire from whence it came, right? All of creation created in concentrated and there was dissolved in that. I didn't think about it then, but I could see the analogies. You see the, um, the deal with the devil. You know, that, that I'll trade my soul for this one. You see these archetypal, but you

Speaker 4:          03:21:46       know, I can watch as many faust places I want. I'm never going to feel what that feels like, right. Until I have the devil mocking me for being a coward, for not being willing to make that deal. You know? And then you understand these certain, these certain things in a much, much deeper way. And, and that's, that's, I think the value. It just puts you up in this situation where you're, you have stake in the game and you have choices to make, and that's where you get the real value. I think Roger Huerta would've put that world crushing in a Thai clinch and slash or right into is fucking stupid phase for sure. And that's part of it. You know, some of the Shamans, that's their move, right? They're constantly trying to get mastery and dominion over all of these things. Wow. I just find that the more you try and fight with them, the more they just love it.

Speaker 4:          03:22:28       Do you like whatever thing you're trying to fight, whatever darkness you're trying to fight, the more you fight with them. They're just like, fuck yeah, bring it on. This is what I do. You're in my house now, bitch. You know, like you're trying to wrestle with Ben Asker and like they got the drop on you, but the minute you change the game and recognize them as an important part and send them love, that's when the conflict ends. One day. Ladies and gentlemen, you too. We'll be able to go to your local IOWASCA center and partake and it's already been approved by the Supreme Court for a couple of different churches to different churches I believe. Right? Yeah. And you mentioned center diamond and uh, uh, udv. Yeah. And they are legally allowed to serve super high potency IOWASCA. Yup. Over Rick Strassman went over there and did it with him.

Speaker 4:          03:23:15       He said it was incredible. They're all wearing like golf shirts, Hawaiian, White, sit up, sit down, talk to do different things. Yeah. It's all common, you know, whether it's religious or whether it's medical or whether it's, I think the plants are going to show up when humans need the help the most.
