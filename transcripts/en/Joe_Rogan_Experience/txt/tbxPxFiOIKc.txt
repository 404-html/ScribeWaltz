Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Joe rogan podcast all day, the Joe Rogan experience podcast all day.

Speaker 2:          00:00:15       Hey everybody. Let me introduce you to everybody here because we've got a large group of humans. First of all, we have my good friend Dr. Mark Gordon. He's been on the podcast before, brilliant endocrinologist slash all around. Awesome dude and his friend and patient, Matthew Gosney and Matthew and I'm right here to my left. We have Jason Halls, a screenwriter for American sniper and we're going to get into a lot of things on this podcast, but one of the big ones that we're going to talk about is Dr Gordon, if you've listened to the previous podcast that he and I did have, you haven't. It's excellent. Go back and check it out if you're bored. Um, but you're an expert in traumatic brain injury and you contacted me about Matthew and you've, you've done some amazing work on soldiers coming back from, uh, from Iraq and Afghanistan and also athletes with ptsd and the issues that come out of ptsd.

Speaker 2:          00:01:08       Not just psychological but traumatic brain injury, which is something that we're dealing with more with these series of wars. And we ever had before, because of the advancements in medical science, they're able to keep people alive that may have died before and also they're able to recognize what's going on, what shell shock is this term that they used after World War Two and know would they. They changed it a little bit in Vietnam that they altered the name of it, but essentially we're dealing with the same issues. We're dealing with the trauma to both the mind and the consciousness that's happening to people that experienced horrible things, see horrible things, but also experienced damage to their actual brain itself.

Speaker 3:          00:01:49       Absolutely. The point of a foundation is the distinction between what ptsd is versus minimal or mild traumatic brain injury. Unfortunately about 410,000 vets were coming back with what's being late. They're being labeled as traumatic as ptsd when in fact they have a form of traumatic brain injury. The distinction between the two is a psychological one which has ptsd and a physical one which is traumatic brain. Under the psychological. You've witnessed, you know, horrible things out there in the battlefield where you've seen your friends being gutted or ied, blowing them up in being left without any limbs, and then in the psychologic, in the physical one, you actually have the impact of the explosion or a penetrating wound like a shot to the head or being bludgeoned and in football, and it's believed that under the psychological one with the ptsd, that reliving the event that precipitated is what causes you to become depressed and anxious and so forth.

Speaker 3:          00:02:52       Under the minimum or the mild traumatic brain injury. It's the physical trauma to the brain that leads to deficiencies of hormones, which is what my whole premise has been for my treatment of traumatic brain injury. So what's being missed is there are guys that go out there in the field who have already had issues of traumatic brain injury because they'd been fighting a firing weapons which caused jolting action or they've been jumping off out of planes and hitting the ground at 10, 15, 20 miles an hour. These types of impacts are significant amount of to make a traumatic brain injury and interrupt the way that the brain controls our hormone balance in our body, and this is all fairly new, this understanding of these things like jumping out of planes or even playing soccer and heading the ball. Correct. That's what we're finding in in football, you know by the time you get into the national football league, you've already gone through peewee pop warner in high school, junior high school and so forth and college football, and by the time you get to the major games you've already have the entire process of loss of functionality in the brain and then you need just one more hit, one more, not even loss of consciousness to create the scenario of inflammation in the brain that leads to hormone deficiency.

Speaker 3:          00:04:10       Yeah, it's the. The issue has always been thought of as when you. When it comes to brain damage, you, you always thought of people who have been beaten up like boxers that have had long careers or football players who have had long careers and they just stayed in too long, but we're finding that a lot of athletes like mark Henry's, his name was no, what was his name? The young guy, Chris Henry, Chris at the young guy who fell off the back of a truck, did something really irrational. His girlfriend was driving away, jumped on the back of her truck, fell off, died, hit his head, but then when they examined his brain, like this guy has a brain of a 70 year old Alzheimer's patient. Right, and it's all just be. And he was 26, I believe, 26. I'm a mid twenties and just a career of playing in the NFL as well as well as college football, high school.

Speaker 3:          00:04:59       The whole deal that like you detailed had left this guy with a significantly damaged brain before he was even 30 years old and he was running around functioning. Nobody had suspected this. He was behaving like a normal person. Correct. If you look at the suicides that have been happening in football, when they're between the ages of 25 and 35 that committing suicide, looking at their brain, you see that they're aging a lot more faster than normal person, and in fact a study that was performed by the nfl showed that there was an 18 times faster occurrence of Alzheimer's disease in people who have had traumatic brain injury playing in nfl. We've had boxers as patient. Two Thousand and seven did a espn outside the line with a two football players in a boxer, James, Tony, and we showed his hormone levels were down low. The laboratory read them all as being low.

Speaker 3:          00:05:54       I didn't have to interpret it. The lab did so that verified the fact that they were really low and he had a lot of difficulties with weight, with control and so forth. And as the host of the show said, how can you be testosterone growth hormone deficient and still be able to do that kind of functioning. You know, the personality takes over. You know, it's just the way that the person projects their life hormones help to stabilize it, to make it available, and then you as an individual get to decide what you do. And he was in the ring fighting as though there was nothing wrong, but he had a lot of problems outside the ring.

Speaker 4:          00:06:27       So what you're saying essentially is that is just his, his discipline and his will that kept him fighting, but he was significantly depleted. Correct.

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       He was unbelievably depleted. And then looking at a gentleman by the name of Brad legged, who was the mariners and the patriots, his hormone levels were incredibly low when he talks about how his, I'll use rejuvenation occurred where he improved in mental functioning, physical functioning and physiological functioning. When he had his hormones returned to normal and pat harlow was on the show and they all talked about their experience when from multiple head traumas. I think pat said he had double digit head traumas and um, you know, if we go back and start doing some of the new technology, like a dtm awry, which has an MRI that looks at the connectivity of nerves. Look at a pet scanner spect scan that looks at the flow of blood through the brain and you can find areas of deficit because they've been damaged and you can't get them back.

Speaker 4:          00:07:21       And Matthew, how did you get in touch with Dr Gordon and had this whole process start? I'll start with your shell. Actually, when he was on here last time I was in the hospital for a suicide attempt and was an avid listener. Was listening to that. He was on here talking about it. You know, I was at my last. I had no other options essentially. And you're a veteran explaining. Explain your history for the people listening to this. Sure. On the navy seal medic. I've been out since 2008. I live up in Washington, got out, started having all kinds of issues, just kind of down spiraled. Went into the va finally and said, this is going on. Immediately they diagnosed me with PTSD, handed me about 10 medications and then we did follow ups checkups can what kind of medications? The SSRI antidepressants, antianxiety meds. I have chronic pain, so they dosed me up on pain medications to cotton things along those lines. Fentanyl, morphine, oxycontin. It was on all three at one point. Jesus, by the way, how high did you get

Speaker 5:          00:08:32       the ground? Totally feel bad for them or jealous did he share?

Speaker 4:          00:08:43       Wow. And so, um, I was just having a lot of issues. I was really depressed. I started gaining weight. I couldn't get up out of bed. I was married at the time, really struggling all that. Then my wife left me because of what was going on and I just, I mean, I literally had no hope because it, I was thinking that I can't be fixed because they're giving me all these things saying this is going to make you better, this is going to make you better. And my mind wasn't getting any better. So, you know, I decided it was better that I just wasn't here. And ended up in the hospital, was there for a week. My wife actually brought me, um, my ipod and all my stuff. So I was able to listen because she knew that I and listened to the show. And he was on here, it literally, the day I got out, I went on and I applied, got a grant, had all my lab work done, got sent to him. Uh, he sent me all my results back and so we figured out kind of what kind of protocol I needed to do and then I flew down here to talk to him and started, uh, the trt.

Speaker 6:          00:09:46       So what do you think, I mean, if you could, do you have like a series of events that you can recall that caused your injuries or is it just a, just the entire entirety of your career in the military?

Speaker 4:          00:09:59       Well, I was in two IED explosions to the face, so I have six bolts in my jaw. I took shrapnel to the side of my face. I was shot in my leg. I'm just from all the damage of doing everything, not related to any mission, but I ended up having surgeries on my shoulder, arthritis and all my joints I have back issues. I mean, so it just all kind of compounded into one of damage. And then just, you know, shooting on fours all day, jumping out of things, rolling around, you know, even just, um, you know, just hand to hand combat when we're practicing things you can get thrown on the ground and, you know, over time it's just, that's essentially what it was, is just so much stuff happened over time. Then that just compounded.

Speaker 6:          00:10:41       And did you feel this coming on slowly or was it very quickly? Was it when you got home was when you were over there?

Speaker 4:          00:10:48       Um, that's a hard thing to answer because for me it wasn't very noticeable other than the fact that I just didn't feel good mentally. I wasn't there mentally. You learn to shut things off, you become desensitized to the world around you. It as a soldier, it's a survival mechanism. And so emotionally I was able to do that, to turn it off where everyone else around me could see something was wrong. I wasn't acknowledging it because to me there wasn't anything wrong. Um, but, you know, I just thought the pain that I had, that was just going to be the way it was. I was depressed with everything. I thought, hey, that's just life. Now I went and did this. Now I have to deal with that, and you have this stubborn mentality because you put all these goals in front of you and you've always accomplished them, so now here's something that they're saying, yeah, you have this, okay, I can beat this too, but as you're, you keep going. You're fine. Hey, I'm not doing. I can't beat this. What's going on here? So then you look at yourself when you go, this is just me.

Speaker 6:          00:11:50       And does it get to a point where it seems like life is

Speaker 4:          00:11:53       so painful and there's so much negativity involved in your day to day existence that it seems pointless and you just want to shut it off and ended. Is that like what's the mindset before you decided to try to take your life? That's exactly the mindset. I mean, for me the breaking point was I think when my wife left because she didn't leave because she didn't love me. She left because she couldn't live with me. And if this person that I love and who loves me back, he can't live with me, then what's the point in me being here and if she's begging me to get better and I'm going to counseling, I'm going on all these medications, they're switching my medications up every three months because the fucking not working and you're going, okay, I can't keep doing this. I can't keep going on meds. I can't keep being stoned out of my mind, I guess you could say with all the pain meds and just.

Speaker 4:          00:12:41       I mean I didn't even feel like a human being. There was this fog. I didn't have cognitive function. I could barely read. I'm an avid reader, I mean 10 minutes, 15 minutes. And I was like, fuck this, I can't do it. It just, even even sleeping and was like, alright, I guess I couldn't sleep. Struggled with that. So even sleep wasn't even giving me comfort. And so it was just, you know, there was no point to be here. And were you in contact still with a lot of the guys you served with and did they have similar issues? Some of them did, some of them had different kinds of issues. Um, I think there's a stigma that ptsd causes us huge aggression. That's, you know, anyone I discussed with a and I tell them, you know, I have ptsd like, oh, are you gonna you're worried you're going to fucking snap and kill everybody.

Speaker 4:          00:13:28       And I think, um, that's not, I don't know if that's as common as it's been made out to be. I think there's just been some huge cases and it's come out, but it definitely is an issue. But for me that, that wasn't the case. Excuse me. For me it was more just internalizing everything and shutting off and just, um, uh, but you know, having the ability. I was telling Dr Gordon this yesterday, you know, for like for my wife, she didn't know what Matthew, she was getting each morning and there was the matthew who was loving could listen or whatever, you know, the one she married or she was in get the math, you could rip your soul out and eat it right in front of her. And she didn't know. And I was never, I never hurt her, but um, there's definitely, when you shut off emotions, uh, there's a fierceness to that and it's scary, you know, she would tell me, you know, your, your face scares me and I wouldn't hurt her, but there it's a protection thing for me.

Speaker 4:          00:14:21       And you just, um, you just learn. So a protection thing, meaning, like your aggression, it was almost like to shut other people out. Yeah. Well, yeah, there's multiple things to that. One, I didn't want to deal with it. And two, if I could shut them out, then um, then I didn't have to acknowledge that I was interactions. I just don't want to interact. I don't want to talk to you. I don't even want to look at you just go away. And because you could see the pain, every time they look at you and it's just a reminder, it's that case of, you know, you can't, can't get better until you acknowledge it's wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       So you just don't acknowledge it in the same bucket. So you, you hear about Dr Gordon on the podcast. You hear about this, the treatment for traumatic brain injury, and you hear about hormone replacement and the damage to the pituitary gland that happens during these impacts. You, you get together and you start hormone replacement therapy. And then what are the results? Well, it sounds like an infomercial does. I mean, it almost sounds almost sounds like a miracle cure, but at this point, for me it was, um, within 10 days, the biggest thing for me was my cognitive function. Within 10 days the fog was lifted. I could think clearly I could do things again. Um, and even physically within those first 10 days, I was able to get out of bed, less pain, you know, I could move. Um, and then within like six weeks I started feeling like matthew started feeling like me, okay, I can go to the gym today, you know, and I can go do this today.

Speaker 3:          00:15:46       I can read today, I can interact today. I mean, it, it's so hard to describe because you got so used to how it felt that once it starts changing, you're like, Whoa, this is unreal. This is happening. So this, I'm a different person, my real, I'm the real me, but a different person than you know, or had been the last couple of years and so it's, it's almost an adjustment because now you've got to go back and try to just heal all the damage that you did around you. Wow. You know, so just replacing your hormones had that significant an effect on your wellbeing, how you interacted with people. She cope, changed everything. That's amazing. So what, what exactly did you. Well, what'd you put them on? Tell me what, what, how did it start as a medical issue of talk about that now he's given me the green light.

Speaker 3:          00:16:34       He gave me the green light for it. You know, we ran through a 28 point hormonal assessment and that 28 hormones assessment looks at brain regulation of the peripheral hormones, you know, in order to make testosterone signal comes from the pituitary and tells your testicles or a woman the ovaries to make Gastrin, stoss drone and then whatever. And in looking at his pattern, he had a very deep deficiency of the regulatory mechanism for production of testosterone. But testosterone is only one of the multitude of hormones that we focus on. There's Dht, dihydrotestosterone is Dah, da Di dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. And what we're finding, you said we think of hormones as gender or sex hormones. Well, the sex aspect of it as baby 30 slash 40 percent. The roots, the remainder is on repair and maintenance of our body. One of the greatest things about testosterone's, anti inflammatory.

Speaker 3:          00:17:27       What happened to your joint pains in your back? Pains on testosterone. So reduced by half of that first week. That's incredible. And this is in the literature, you know, I won't get too technical because I won't understand it myself, but the issue is that the testosterone growth hormone like estrodial progesterone all regulate inflammatory chemistry in our body, our immune system. And we've also found in the past seven to 10 years that the brain makes its own hormones and its own hormones being testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrogen and so forth in the brain. And what they do is they regulate the ability of the nerves. And I just gave a lecture that we called, um, the non permissive environment which talks about when you have head trauma neurotrauma, where you've been hit or explosion and so forth were areas of the brain shut down in their ability to produce hormones that regulate how you feel in your ability to have cognitive functioning.

Speaker 3:          00:18:21       So not only on testosterone replacement, we use physiological dosing, which is, you know, an average 25 to 35 year old male makes about four to 10 milligrams a day. So we'll use 60 milligrams a week or 80 milligrams a week, which is about a fourth. The amount that's used out there by traditional physicians who are replacing testosterone. And he got phenomenal response without any of the side effects. So the hormone replacement includes I'm anti inflammatory medication, which are all natural things like Pqq, which is a form of Co q 10 that stopped the production of oxygen. They call it reactive oxygen species, which are oxidative chemistry oxidants. And that leads to death of cells. And there's an incredible amount of literature that has been out for many, many years. And now it's getting more focused that in order for us to heal the brain, not only do we have to replace the hormones, but we also have to protect it from this oxidative stress that the brain goes through.

Speaker 3:          00:19:17       Sounds like, you know, one of those trendy kind of statements, but it's actually factual and there's just thousands of articles coming out and how much we need glutathione or we need vitamin C dot Pqq, Co q 10, all the things that take the free radicals that are damaging the ability of the brain to regenerate. And uh, in this lecture I just gave back in 1911, there was a guy by the name of Italo who proved that we can generate our nerve cells or neurons. And then 19, 28, and then there's a guy in Canada who's like the guru and the ability to regenerate the brain, but you have to have the right environment. That right environment involves, you know, hormones. And also to help step up the system's ability to fight the oxidative stress.

Speaker 6:          00:20:02       Why is this a sort it, if not ignored? Why is this not commonly known by a lot of physicians or by a lot of people that talk about different neurochemicals that change behavior because we think of dopamine and Serotonin. Those are the two big ones, right? When you think of Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, when you think of antidepressants or when you think of people depleting that with drugs, you're thinking of dopamine and serotonin primarily. Well, very rarely does he do. The other ones get brought up. Well, I think

Speaker 3:          00:20:35       unfortunately there's a financial motivation to things. Matthew is on probably about 40 or 50 a month of medication. One of the medications that he was on was a couple hundred dollars a month and when you're talking about, I think you said 15 total medications that when you add up the cost per month, you're talking about thousands of dollars a month, so it was history and keeping these people in medical industry as well. As you know, the analogy that I make is, if you remember back in Legionella Pneumophila in Philadelphia, which was a lung infection, they went and gave these people know thousand dollars drugs and it turned out that it was a fifty cent drug. Erythromycin that treated it. We're looking for things that are so brand new that we've ignored the very basic fundamentals. My martial arts instructor always said back to basics, back to basics. Thank you young you. So,

Speaker 6:          00:21:33       so Jason Hall, uh, you're a screenwriter, you, you wrote American sniper, which has been directed by Clint Eastwood, which is a, uh, when is that coming out? It comes out at Christmas and it's about Chris Kyle, a famous story of the book, American sniper, of course, best selling book and a tragedy where he was killed while he was working with Ptsd sufferers and he was working with someone on the range who was suffering and he wound up getting killed by them. How did you get involved in all this?

Speaker 7:          00:22:06       I'll say first that you know, that's a, that's a pending trial. So we don't know if that guy had ptsd or you just had a screw loose or what it was. He got approached by a woman who is working to get that sucker right up to your mouth. Woman who was working in the parking lot at his kid's school said, you know, my, my kid is suffering and read your book, you serve. Can you help him out? And that's about all he got. And uh, he'd been helping out a lot of vets and uh, you know, this guy had it informed and uh, it was, it was a tragic story. I met Chris, uh, in 2010. He got out in 2009 and I'd heard his story and I went down to Texas to meet him. And, uh, I'd never been to Texas before either and had, hadn't met many navy seal snipers.

Speaker 7:          00:22:51       Welcome to America to access and navy seals altogether. I showed up and it's like 60 cops, 60 Texas cops, like half of all the Texas Rangers were in the room and uh, and I don't drink. So I wasn't real popular at first. The only way I could ingratiate myself to them was one of them was picking on me and call me Hollywood liberal and this and that and panty waist and, and uh, so I throw them in a front headlock and I had jacked him up a little bit and then Chris finally started talking to me. It was like a choke him out a little bit. Yeah. How did you get

Speaker 6:          00:23:28       involved in this? You, you read the story?

Speaker 7:          00:23:31       I heard this story. Yeah. I heard the story of this guy had shot, you know, you've got more confirmed kills in anyone US military history. And uh, I called a buddy of mine who was serving. He had a, he had been seal team six. He was working down at the CIA at the farm and I said, hey, this guy, this guys killed, got more confirmed kills than anybody. And he hit a shot from 2100 yards, confirmed, kill at 2100 yards. He's like, I got news for you buddy. Your guy's full of shit. You're full of shit. They're five guys on the planet who can hit that shot in your boys. Not One of them. I was like, all right, well look it up. So he calls back and he's like, so uh, Chris, cause one of the five. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:12       There's a vortex optics. Some, a friend of mine that are provided me with scopes and stuff for hunting. They, they actually got a call from someone in Afghanistan that was about to shoot somebody and they needed to know how to adjust their scope correctly. So they were talking over a sat phone with the guys at vortex and giving them the exact adjustments to make some fucking thousand yard shot. Yeah, thanks. Take care. It's great when you get to like real long distance, like a thousand yards plus, I mean a lot of it is just calculations and mathematics and understanding scopes and how much the bullet's gonna drop.

Speaker 7:          00:24:51       Yeah. And I think some of it is, some of it is instinct and I think some of it is, you know, he said God kissed the bullet. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:59       Jesus Christ. Amen. God's mean fuck or not either way kissed it or he blew on it. Whatever happened, it worked. Um, so you get involved with these guys. You start in just becoming immersed in the world of the soldiers and their issues. And how did you get connected to Matthew and to Dr Gordon?

Speaker 7:          00:25:24       Well, when I met Chris, you know, I walked in, I met him, I looked him in the eye and I was like, Oh shit, you know, this guy's not home yet. Like you could see it in his eyes. There was something going on and it felt, it felt like there was turmoil there. It felt like he was still fighting and I called my wife and I was, I was like, I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't know what's going to go on with this guy. I don't know, you know, how he's going to work it out. But he's, he's got some stuff to work out and it's, you know, it was hard to look at. It was hard to look into his eyes. And uh, thankfully his wife and his kid showed up the next day and I saw it change. I saw for a minute the fog kind of lifted and I saw him light up, his kids ran into his arms and, and I saw like, here's what this guy was like before the war, you know, this is the man who, who was there before the war and, and here's maybe the man that he could become again.

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       Wow. How many of these guys are just tough and they just deal with this new reality. I mean, it seems like that is a big part of what's going on when you're saying the guy wasn't back yet, but yet he was physically and he was going through emotions and living his life. But all the shit that probably was going on in his brain and certainly going on in his psyche, I think most come back that way. I think that's their first mentality is like, for me, you don't, you're not going to admit that

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       I've beaten things worse than this. I'm going to keep going. Especially seals, right? Yeah. Just to get through buds, just to get through any of it. That's what I said. But any, any challenge has been in front of me. It seems like I've completed it. And so this, that's all it was. And once I finally realized that I couldn't how broken, because then I, then I really felt broken because it's never happened. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. I just all dark. It goes dark to the end of time. Yeah. I mean the best parts about me were gone and had Chris Kyle, if he received any treatment for ptsd other than the standard dose of painkillers and Ssrs and what have you.

Speaker 7:          00:27:27       No, you know, I think Chris, I think Chris dealt with it, doing some drinking and then he finally kind of worked his way through it. Got a little, you know, got back into church and, and started actually helping these guys helping other veterans and he found peace in that he found peace and helping other guys. And you know, I can't speak to, to what he felt when he laid his head down on the pillow at night. But, uh, he found some real solace in, in helping these vats and they'd, you know, they'd bring them up and they'd go out shooting at the range or go hunting and uh, you know, and end up talking around the bed of a pickup truck for four hours with a couple of beers in and then you, you get a little bit of this comradery and, and they don't feel so alone. We had a purpose. Again, you have a purpose while you're in, you have a job

Speaker 4:          00:28:15       now and it's gone. It's ripped from you and there's not, you know, there's no clear goal or mission in front of you anymore. So you kind of searched for that. Like for me, I kind of was trying to figure out what, you know, what the fuck am I going to do with myself now? What mission can I accomplish? And it's not there anymore. There's no people, you know, there's the structure of things are gone, the command is gone. It's just you. And I think if it hadn't been for my wife, I've never even would have gone in to the va honestly because there's, there's just happened to be someone that lived with me the whole time who's like, you need to go in or I'm gone. And I mean if she hadn't been there, I'd probably still be that way. Now. Honestly, the UFC has done a lot of work for a traumatic brain injury and uh, in, in, in helping to fund the Intrepid Center for traumatic brain injury.

Speaker 4:          00:29:08       And one of the most shocking things to me when we got involved, we started doing these fights with the troops, was that there was no funding for this, that they had to get funding from other sources that they had to get funding from donations and they had to ask people to call in and donate. And just unbelievably shocking to me that we spend so much money to send these guys over there. So much money for weapons and so much money for the latest high tech ways to kill people. And so little on how to treat

Speaker 7:          00:29:42       these guys when they come back. And girls. I mean it's, it's an issue, so little money and also so little imagination and so little willingness to, to explore new things. We're talking about a fucking blood test. Yeah. He's talking about a blood test to test their hormones and it's like, oh, what a crazy idea. This guy's out of the box. He's crackers, you know, and it's, it's. You look at the, you look at, at the symptoms, they're having the same symptoms the guys in the nfl are having. It's the same symptoms that guys would. Low Testosterone or habit and it's not a huge mystery, you know, but it is a mystery to all these people and you know, we're also talking about Kris Carr who was the Achilles of Iraq and like that guy was having a hard time. That guy had to go through the same thing and go talk to somebody.

Speaker 7:          00:30:31       You know, there's a lot of guys out there who served and got no thanks for it. They've got no recognition. They got. They were anonymous soldiers in a, in a war that nobody wanted and they came home and they were messed up. Most, most of them. Most are like that, you know, and, and look, I'm sure there's guys who came home and they were okay. Like I, I haven't met a ton of those guys. I've, some of the seals are like that. They're fun, you know, God bless. But I spent the last year after writing sniper, I'm adapting a book called thank you for your service and this guy followed these guys home. He followed a battalion of army guys home from, uh, from Iraq and followed their wanderings into like how they were going to get back into their lives and how they, these guys were going to deal with their stress and dealing with the Va. And it was a nightmare man. And you meet these guys that just, they don't have any hope. They don't have any hope. And you know, some of them have, have, have the ptsd and some of them have additional injuries like matthew had and they've got nothing. They've got nothing in the va is like, you know, you're talking 22 soldiers a day kill themselves for soldiers who have killed themselves and have died. And they'll correct which is the first time in any war in us history.

Speaker 3:          00:31:47       Well, the thing we keep, we keep records of it now there's a website which is called prevention and awareness, suicide prevention awareness, which is a military site which keeps track of all the suicides and also things to prevent it. And they keep records of the dod in the 22 a day I think is, uh, is not an accurate number. and there was another report that came out where it's like 40 today where it's even more, but you're right in 2012, when they started really releasing the numbers, there were more people killed, more people committed suicide. Then people were killed in A year of fighting in 2000 unfucking. Believable from a patient standpoint going into the va. I liked the va and they've been nothing but very kind to me and very good to me. So I don't have anything in that regard to say. But when you go in there and you get diagnosed with ptsd, they you

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       one of the meds and to with all these appointments to talk to people who want, you're not gonna fucking relate to, I'm sorry, but ms dot susie over there, hasn't seen what I've seen or done what I've done and she's trying to engage me in this conversation and all I want to do a slim face on the floor because she's trying to act as if she's my friend and knows what I'm talking about and she doesn't. And I know she only has goodwill, but as a patient sitting there and this is supposed to help you and it's not helping you like this is fucking stupid. And that's what happens. Most people go to like one or two sessions and never go to counseling again. You cannot fix the mind when the body is not working. When it's physiologically not working correctly, the mind will never get better.

Speaker 4:          00:33:24       So that's essentially what's happening is they're trying to fix these ma, the mind and these mental issues without fixing the physiological aspect of it. And then wondering why none of these people are getting better. Okay, well, why are none of these medications working? How many more medications can we give you, you know, before you end up in a situation like mine. And that's what's happening. And it's that part of it is ridiculous. And that part of it angers me because it is such an easy fix. It's such a, it seems like an easy fix, you know, as a patient that was effective fix in effect the fix. But it's that, um, you know, I remember when I first was going in there for my chronic pain, you know, they started me off with like aspirin, tylenol. They went through this progression to where they were.

Speaker 4:          00:34:08       And I remember my doctor look at me saying, I know what you need, but I have to do it this way. So not only did I waste another six months to a year going on these ineffective because I did need something for my pain, probably not what they gave me, but that's just another, you know, um, example of sometimes I think they know that it's not working, but they're in this bureaucracy where they have to just, that's, you know, it's a federal institution. They have to do this. That's what they have to have, sort of a chain of prescriptions. There's, this just didn't work. We tried that and documentation of it. Is that what it is? Well, yeah, I mean it's, it's a rainbow of medications that everyone starts off on it seems like. And that's what everyone's getting when they go in there and then they're wondering while none of them are effect, you know, some of them are effective, but as a whole they're not.

Speaker 4:          00:34:55       And so you go in there. I mean, I was going in, you know, you know, I would go in after 30 days, it's, I really do anything. All right, let's try it another two months. Okay, here's three months. Well, let's either up your dose or let's just throw that shit in the garbage and give you something else. So noT only are you taking something, my body's been on for three months now and then just introducing it to something else. you know, that I was like, I was becoming worse. I was just becoming more just not when the frustration, frustration you need by the end of that you need a stronger medication just to deal with all the appointments you've been to. Oh yeah. It's ridiculous. I mean, I, I did stop going to all my mental counseling sessions because I knew that wasn't, was, wasn't what was going to help me.

Speaker 4:          00:35:37       I didn't need, especially not talking to them, you know, maybe maybe a friend or something, but a lot of that stuff that happens over there, I don't want to talk about it at all. It's very sacred. It's very personal and intimate and to me it's not a game. Most of the people around you talk to you and it's a fucking video game. It's cAlled a duty and they sit there and they talk, you know, they talk and he was at that like that and you're like, listen, this is not okay, so you just don't say anything. Not only that, I'm not going to tell my wife because she doesn't need to know any of this horror stuff that I went through. So you just internalize it. You internalize it, you're buddies. You almost don't want to talk about it because you know either you're still buddies or just anyone else she knew in the military because then you're bringing it up to the surface again so it just becomes this thing where you take the deepest aspect of your soul and you just shut the fuck in there and then you pray and walk away and that is part of the problem and it's a mental issue.

Speaker 4:          00:36:32       It's that mental issue of like, I think it progresses down this, this slope downhill because when your body just starts smell functioning, all this stuff that you're trying to deal with mentally goes with it. It just all goes down and then you then you can't start handling just the daily things of life around you can't handle, oh, they got my coffee wrong. All right, well now I'm fucking pissed and let's go break a ton of shit. You know, just simple things like that, that everyday it's like, no, it's not a big issue, you know, but you can't handle the little things around you and you don't have a buffer. Yeah, there's no buffer. There's no nothing. I mean, and you find things to do. I tried to find all kinds of hobbies to do and they work for a week, but then you're just, you realize you're right where you were and you just keep moving on and it just never gets better. And that's the thing that was so frustrating about it.

Speaker 6:          00:37:20       It's also got to be frustrating for you, Dr. Gordon, to know that there's sort of an ignorance involved in just treating the mind or just treating the symptoms of antidepressants with these kinds of medications when you're dealing with so many different things holistically. The entire body has so many issues that aren't being addressed and they just addressing this one thing because this is all these doctors know,

Speaker 3:          00:37:47       correct. It's really an a masking process that they're doing. The patient has complaints of isolation, which matthew had isolation, withdrawal, and hedonism. He weren't enjoying doing the things you were enjoying before. And that's classical depression. So we'll put them on an antidepressant. Uh, you're having difficulty sleeping and put them on tresona and put them on whatever medication in the frustration is. The literature is so clear. I mean, I didn't invent anything. I just sit in front of the computer for eight, nine hours a day and read the literature that's coming out from all over the planet and they're so compelling that I put it into clinical application, uh, with not only the veterans but with the civilians who have had traumatic brain injury from motor vehicle accidents, slip and fall, what have you, and the responses across the board. Once you find the laboratory proven deficiencies or insufficiencies and you replace it, you get these incredible responses.

Speaker 3:          00:38:46       A woman 32 years ago who had an motor vehicle accident head on we're neck, hit the steering wheel and crushed her karate and she had a stroke on the opposite side, 32 years of being on a multitude of medications and then she comes in and within a month she's feeling better. They had her on adderall to counteract the side effects of the five psychotropic drugs like the ssri is and whatever and whatever, and I'm at one month goes back to her psychiatrist in the south and she says to the doc, a female doc, she says, I'd like to get off these medications. The doc says, honey, I put people on antidepressants. I adam, take them off, and that's the mentality that we have to start educating that there are all our alternatives, but they're being told the quick fix is to put them on an antidepressant.

Speaker 3:          00:39:31       Listening to matthew story, in 10 days, the clouds started to lift. The fog started to dissipate and by six weeks he was coming back to who matthew remembered himself being. That's the place. Then that's the place where he can deal with the other stuff that has been suppressing. Yes, correct. Exact. Because these are. These things are not independent of each other. You know, in the past I started in 2004. I had four head traumas and when I was between 34 and 46, I think I shared this with you once before. Between 34 and 46 I started developing depression was depression was on paxil just wasn't a happy camper. What will your head traumas from, let's say at four years of age, playing jungle gym in New York during the winter, hit my head on the metal bars, landed up in the ground at, believe it or not, I was sitting,

Speaker 3:          00:40:20       dare you shut that off, shoot it. And then when I was riding my bicycle to a hebrew school at between twelVe and 13, I was hit by a car and knocked down or cut my face, cut my chin. let's see. At 18 years of age on the swim team, I was screwing around and hit my head on the swimming poured. And then in the February 9th, February 9th, 19, 71 sylmar earthquake, before you were born, a shelf, a large shelf fell on my head and knocked me out. So I was, you know, went through undergraduate medical school, residency. Everything was fine, but between 34 and 46 started developing all these symptoms and then I went to a facility and I had my hormones checked and I was thyroid, which you saw me take earlier, thyroid, testosterone growth hormone deficient and uh, started on it. And within a period, let's see, august to November 3rd, I woke up totally different person, similar to what matthew was stating.

Speaker 3:          00:41:17       And not until that was 99, not until 2004 when I read an article out of Turkey, Turkey, they have a lot of pugilist. I like boxing. And there was this one article that said that boxers in Turkey were found to have unusually high amounts of growth hormone deficiency. And the following year, muay thai in Thailand came out. And then that was my epiphany. I went back to the literature and started finding one, two, five, 10 articles talking about head trauma associated with hormone deficiency and from 2014 to present, that's all I read is these relationships and we know in gerontology and geriatric medicine, internal medicine that as mail gets to be in sixties and seventies that you see them go through a process that they called dysthymia, which is a mild kind of a blue, you know, feeling blue depression and they have significant testosterone deficiency. When you replaced it, they get better.

Speaker 3:          00:42:10       so why can't we see that things that accelerate your last head trauma leading to testosterone deficiency causing depression, that looking at the older generation who have, or the older age individuals who have hormone deficiency, both males and females that they developed depression. Why can't you link the two? And that's where the problem's been in linking the two issues. Hormone deficiency for whatever cause can predispose you to, uh, issues of, uh, you know, uh, psychological problems and psychological problems like depression is the number one is fatigued. Did you have fatigue, fatigue, fatigue with out being able to sleep, correct. Fatigue, insomnia, depression, rage, just for no reason. You just start being angry and rage, screaming at people. Patients has gone, a libido, sexual drive is gone. You start doubting yourself. A sense of wellbeing is gone. A plum has gone confidence and assertiveness has gone and that's this issue of what they call co-morbidity.

Speaker 3:          00:43:12       When you're arguing the fact of it being ptsd, psychological versus a physiological cause for that psychological, I think the head trauma creates the scenario biochemically to allow you to have sensitivity to these things that are called cycle effect of disease or cycle neurotic diseases or whatever they're using today. So it predisposes it so it mAkes you susceptible to the correct or the bad thoughts. Correct. What's the difference between, you know, you were talking when you were talking to jason, that when you saw, when chris saw his kids, his personality changed. That was the stimulus that was something that, you know, put them on a peak. Same thing with hormone correction. It can correct those thoughts and we're finding something called neuro steroids, which are the minor hormones that run through our body that are lost during inflammatory processes throughout the body can affect the brain that stabilize our ability to not be schizophrenia.

Speaker 3:          00:44:04       Our ability not to be depressed, our cognitive ability so that the long neurons that conduct information over long period of time to ingrain our raw memories and so forth are stabilized. And if you lose that stabilization, it's like pulling the plug. You lose that ability to control it or you know, turning the sound all the way down. So by correcting the hormones, that allows for the sound to come back up to where it should be so that you can function at the level that I'm matthew is. We have a lot of people that have had a multitude of injuries. Um, what happened was because of a laboratory access medical lab in Florida, they gave me a grant. And what happens that they gave me a chunk of money and I matched it out of my pocket of my practice to provide the type of services that matthew in a large group of other vets from the green berets from the navy.

Speaker 3:          00:44:59       Unshipped navy. It's same navy, right? Yeah. The st louis side, the blue side. Right. And, um, in fact, matthew matthew was the last one to get in on this program and because we ran out of funds and, uh, we did a radio show a couple of weeks ago and one of my patients calls and offers US the money to get the system back up and running. And last week when I was lecturing in vegas, I'm approached by someone who had put in a grant with deal with the dod, uh, doctors and get a patty and dr dash at a university test of Texas who are now helping me to apply for a dod grant so that I can continue doing the work that we've been doing. I'm still taking money out of my pocket. And uh, the lab is still providing us With the funds so that we can have a trickle of people, but before we get 10 people at a time and they've all gotten better, just not a lot of people that are talking about this though in the sense that the way you're talking about it, like did you see the hbo real sports piece on traumatic brain injury in football players?

Speaker 3:          00:46:02       No. Well you're, you're seizing all these pieces on these guys that have all these issues, but what you eat, well they know what they're saying essentially is we have to be careful with the amount of damage these guys take and football and there's gotta be some sort of methods in place to mitigate this or at least to monitor, like put sensors on the helmets, but they're not talking about hormones. They're not talking about an another avenue of treatment that is based upon doing the right testing to see what the problem is. They're not doing the testing to find the hormone deficiency. Defining, finding brain damage. They're finding you're going to find dte, the encephalopathy from trauma. You're going to find that. And what the literature is I referred to earlier is showing us that we can regenerate neurons. It's been done, we can heal the brain.

Speaker 3:          00:46:51       And the piece that came out in life extension magazine a couple years ago, you know, they interviewed me for this thing about healing the brain with hormones is happening and healing the brain, regenerate neurons. Like how has that done and what's the process involved? Well, it was my three hour lecture, so I'll make it as short as I can, having head trauma. It initiates a group of inflammation, inflammatory cascades in the brain that have, that changed the chemistry of the brain so that the natural ability of the brain to regenerate nerves is lost. we're finding that thyroid hormone, specifically thyroid three trial to directing, is extremely important to help stem cells in the brain, which they just found, you know, recently in the past 10 years that we have stem cells left in the brain that could regenerate the brain. so when you're thyroid deficient, what happens is the cells lose their ability to stimulate growth factors for nerve regeneration.

Speaker 3:          00:47:48       And so having all the hormones back, removing the trump, the inflammatory processes in the brain can foster a neuro permissive environment with the nerves will grow and the sciences there, they showing the things that stop the things that stimulated and in head trauma, the not have been testing it because the difficulty is in order to know what's going on in the brain, you have to take a brain biopsy. They'd been trying to get a markers. s 100 is one of the markets they're working with right now. That just tells you that it's happened. You know, we're doing so phenomenal at diagnosing that you have traumatic brain injury and seeing it on one of the neuro radiological techniques, but they're failing in treatment. What about the connective tissue between the brain and the skull itself? I mean, isn't that an issue with boxers and fighters that have had repeated trauma to see the connective tissue gets damaged?

Speaker 3:          00:48:41       What happens is subdural hematoma, which is a bleed between the pia mater in the brain. And then there's intra, um, cerebral bleeding that occurs. And what happens, the cause for loss of consciousness is because you've torn, you've shared is what they call an shearing or too few secs o'neil trauma. You've broken the long nerves that connect everything to keep you stimulated to be awake and through this process called an mri or a dtm mri, you can actually see a where nerves have broken and when you break them, that's when you lose consciousness. And so we can detect it. We can not regenerate those directly, but we can build secondary pathways and that's what they're finding. There's a chemical called nogo a and o, g o a, which actually inhibits the ability of nerves to regenerate. And it's by controlling the environment, you know, using ivy gludethyon, using some of the products that we have that can allow the brain to have an a environment and environment where it can regenerate.

Speaker 3:          00:49:50       So the, the, the trauma to the brain itself, the nerves that get damaged will never be replaced. But the secondary pathways that are created to in response to that damage, can they put someone back to the same state that they were at? Will they always be diminished? Like say you're talking about a guy like you know, an unnamed mma champion who at the end of his career starts getting knocked out a bunch of times and we see that with guys who used to be able to take tremendous punches and now all of a sudden they get hit and they just go. Is that because of all those nerve breaks that have happened over the course of their career and the secondary

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       pathways just simply inadequate or is there another response going on where the mind is protecting itself? This is what I've heard described to me. They're shutting off quicker because the mind has recognized this pattern, oh, we're receiving trauma. The best way to do to mitigate this is just shut off.

Speaker 3:          00:50:46       Well, that's a simplified version of it. I'm not to make it too deep, but their tolerance has changed. We're in the past, they have a regenerative capacity or they have endogenous system inside that can help to keep things in balance. When you've lost the ability of this automated system to control things, you pass out whether or not it's the vascular. You're more sensitive. Vascular, so on the head trauma, the blood shunts from one area to another, so you lose the blood that keeps you awake and you pass out. Um, neurologicAlly, yes, they could be breaking more nerves and therefore I'm losing it more readily. It's about resilience tolerance and how much of that you've lost. So you no longer have $100,000 in your bank account. You got a penny. So when you buy that piece of gum that you can't buy you your empty.

Speaker 2:          00:51:41       So any shot, I mean that's what we just shot a shot to the head. They just start going and that doesn't get fixed.

Speaker 3:          00:51:48       correct. Can't answer whether it gets fixed or not because it depends on the individual individual looking at their hormonal. May lou looking at anything else that's a cold morbidity, things that are predisposing them to have a more sensitive response to it. Uh, you know, certain drugs, alcohol, I mean a lot of the drugs that we use, there is one drug that's used a lot, I won't say the name, but deals with cholesterol that doesn't allow cells to regenerate. Also wax your vitamin d and your co q 10

Speaker 2:          00:52:17       when something like that. I can't say the name because I want to get sued. Doesn't want the fucking evil army comIng after them. Well, there are articles showing that to know that the cells

Speaker 3:          00:52:27       breakdown more readily and there's a process for processes in the brain which regulate a nerves staying strong and then being destroyed by.

Speaker 2:          00:52:37       So anyone who's on those kinds of drugs, like anti cholesterol drugs, they're risking a lot of damage to their body. There are multitude of levels you shut off because I have a friend who's on it. Well, anthony bourdain's on it. Uh, you know, and he's, he's on it because he won't stop eating pork. Is it kosher? No, I don't believe he's jewish. He may be the port kosher. Obviously he isn't, it doesn't. Dad's french, right? It could be jewish. I don't, I don't think he was a. Well he's not religious, but he, the Libya. So it doesn't matter. Yeah. But my point is he's, he's taking this just because he doesn't want to do anything to reduce his cholesterol because he, because he enjoys fatty. Awesome food and enjoy it, but that shit is not good. Right? Well,

Speaker 3:          00:53:22       so if cocuten vitamin d in one of the chapters of the new book where I talk about, um, treatment for hormonal, the first case that I presented as a guy who came in to me who was on one of those cholesterol lowering drugs and his, all his hormones were down because cholesterol is the precursor to all our hormones are androgens and estrogens. So cortisol, cortisol, pregnenolone, testosterone, estrone, island, dht and dah da. And they were all reduced. all we did is stopped. Is staten drug and it all came up. I didn't have to do anything. And what do you do to reduce cholesterol other than diet? Like for a guy like that? well, opens up nice, warm the box of worms. The question is, is cholesterol really the issue? When you look at the statistics, 50 percent of all heart attacks happen in people with low or normal levels of cholesterol.

Speaker 3:          00:54:17       So the question that any intelligent person has to ask, excluding myself, is that I'm than what's causing it? How did these people get heart attacks? if the cholesterol is normal or low, why don't die of a heart attack with my cholesterol between 75 and 3:49, and my ultrafast ct scan that looked at my coronary arteries were perfectly clear. how is it that when my best buddies, who's a fighter pilot, uh, has a cholesterol 1:40 to 1:50 and he ended up having open heart surgery because his cholesterol is calcium count was greater than 2000. Mine was zero. His was greater than 2000, less than 100. Great. Greater than 400 dangerous. He was greater than 2000. He had 95 percent occlusion of the main artery. The left anterior descending ends up having open heart surgery and you know, hard to re replaced from his leg. How do you account for it?

Speaker 3:          00:55:05       Well, we went back and we did a series of tests which were gifted by this laboratory. I work within Florida, which called the [inaudible] that looks at the inflammatory markers, inflammation markers that lead to heart disease. So something called pla. See small density, ldl, homocysteine, c reactive protein. There's a whole group of chemistry that causes inflammation to lead to the hardening of the arteries in the body, responds by putting calcium down. That's the atherosclerotic lesions to try and work like a bandaid. And, um, what spinoff that you've heard of culation therapy? Well, culation therapy for many years has been pooh poohed by medical community. In three years ago, the federal government did a study and what did they say? Culation therapy works. What is culation therapy relationship is a two levels of it. One is to remove all the toxins from the body. Our focus was to try and remove the castle calcium deposition of in the arteries and use calcium edta, sodium edta, festival title coleen chemicals that remove it.

Speaker 3:          00:56:04       There's a, a, another product which is called k one, two, three, and seven, which helped to remove calcium deposition from the lining of the arteries. So if you can remove the calcification, you improve the atherosclerotic lesions that narrowed the blood vessels and lead spasming and inflammation that calls and cholesterol. Cholesterol is has two major functions. One is to supply the cells with the precursor to all our hormones except growth hormone and so forth and thyroid and all the sex hormones, and also to repair the wall of the arteries and studies that were done where they took a whole bunch of stuff like trans fatty acids, nicotine, sugar, uric acid, cholesterol, c, reactive protein, testosterone, estrogen. They put it in cultures of the lining of the arteries called endothelia. The only one that didn't cause inflammation was cholesterol. Wow. Wow. And then a lot of articles you know that talk about this, the myth of a cholesterol myth, and that's what I see. Otherwise I have hardening of the arteries, but my genetics on this panel that we do an lp six, all my inflammatory markers are low. My cholesterol is high in keith. His inflammatory markers are high, but with low cholesterol.

Speaker 6:          00:57:20       And so is this just a legacy? Diagnosis is just something that we've said for so many years. The cholesterol causes heart attacks and it just imprinted in our brains. I do remember when people say sodium causes high blood pressure, but if you have no fucking salts, a mineral, goddammit, it's an important part of your body like you. You need salt, you need certain amount of it.

Speaker 3:          00:57:42       Correct, and I think they're making generic statements where they're selective. It should be selective in certain people. Sodium might be bad in certain people. Cholesterol might might be bad. I don't see it

Speaker 6:          00:57:53       wasn't that sodium. The whole diagnosis of sodium causing all these health problems. Wasn't that like inherently flawed in the first place?

Speaker 3:          00:58:01       Yes. What was that? Did you remember what it was specifically, but they were saying that overload of salt in certain racial groups. Can I say that? Yes. You don't say the blacks. Okay, fine. Then I won't say that. I'll say in certain racial groups they've always been known to be more susceptible to a kidney related issues and fluid retention on sodium, so it predisposes them to enlargement of the heart, congestive heart failure, fluid retention in high blood pressure. So in treating certain racial groups, use diuretics that make you go pee to lose the fluid and the blood and other groups use beta blockers to relax the contraction of the heart, other ones to stretched the blood vessels and so forth. So every, um, genetic predisposition has a specific kind of medication that works best. So you can't ubiquitously say, okay, everybody needs a stat and drug. Everybody needs water pill, everybody needs a beta blocker. You have to be very selective and this is what's being lost as matthew experience in his experience. You walk in wiTh any of his symptoms and everybody gets on a prepaid prepaid package of medication instead of individualizing what he needs. He just needed a blood test, a $179 blood test to look at just his testosterone related issues and find out he was deficient and replace

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       it. Any. Are you still on your medication? Any medication? Nope. You're on off everything you go through withdrawal will that morphine and uh, I'm sure it's been awhile, but I know I still take oxycodone and they come down to um, between two and three pills a day. So it's five, three, 25. How many were you on at the peak? Eight a day. A day to day. And that's with morphie? Um, I was on four day. And then you're still taking oxycodone for pain? I do, yeah. And what is the, what, what is causing your pain? Um, well, my gunshot wound in my leg, uh, developed compartment syndrome in there. So essentially I guess the easiest way to describe that as the blood goes into the tissue, it doesn't have anywhere to go. So the pressure builds up and it starts breaking down muscle, a muscle tissue and it's painful.

Speaker 4:          01:00:12       Um, I have six titanium bolts in my jaw from one of the explosion, so I have a lot of joint issues and I took shrapnel in the side by my ear canal. So I just have joint pain from all the movement. Um, yeah, just stuff like, I mean it's not, I'm not near where I was. I mean I have arthritis, things like that. Um, But yeah, I mean I think I was on fentanyl 25. Was it micrograms I think is what it was. Twenty five milligrams every three days. So it was a patch of morphine and was I'm 40 milligrams a day I believe because I think they're 20 milligram pills. I'd have to remember that. And then oxycodone was a five, 3:25 and I was on eight of those and then. So now I'm down to no fentanyl, no morphine and uh, just three. Oxy was a day and it seems to me, I mean I'm ignorant to this, but that still seems like a lot of pain medication for your body to absorb and process is that. It is a lot, but you know, he's got a detox and then you can go through cold Turkey.

Speaker 4:          01:01:15       So I've been on um, the testosterone replacement a little over three months and from there I went from um, I got off the fentanyl a little bit before I started that because I just, I couldn't function with that and there's too, too high. Not high, but I didn't feel high because I was in pain, but I felt down like a suppressed immunosuppressed I guess, something like that. So I went off the morphine and then within three months I went from eight oxies down to three and so, I mean it could be two or three, just kind of depends how I am during the day. So I might take one in the morning when I wake up and then maybe one at night. And is the goal to eVentually eliminate that completely? Yes. Yeah. Hopefully three months Is a pretty significant improvement. I mean, that's amazing. It's such a short period of time. That's the pain meds. That's even the antidepressants, anti anxiety. I mean it's all this stuff. I mean, the only thing that's left out of like a 12 medication panel is literally just the three pain meds. How, how did it, your relationship at home and you have kids almost impersonal. I mean this is what we got divorced. So that. Yeah, that end you have, you have a couple kids, right? Yeah. Um, yeah. I mean I'm,

Speaker 4:          01:02:35       yeah, I mean we're divorced. I mean I interact with, uh, with my ex every day, but

Speaker 8:          01:02:41       um,

Speaker 4:          01:02:43       I'm pretty sure she's got a bitter taste left in her mouth. But does it, um, maybe that was the wrong way to phrase the question, how has it affected your ability to like deal with day life stuff? Yeah, it's much better. I mean, it's hard to even describe it because it's so normal. I mean, I feel so normal now to where it's not an issue.

Speaker 8:          01:03:04       Um,

Speaker 4:          01:03:05       I mean I'm not having that issue of just the biggest thing for me I think was um, the ability to let go when things are upsetting, you know, little things that people everyday just tap in this part of life. Whereas for me, it was end of the world and you know, I want to tear things down. We're now at, just kind of goes off. Um, my interactions with the ex have been better. There's a lot of hurt there. So that comes out sometimes and on both sides because a lot of mistakes were made in anger or in pain. And, you know, that's for me right now, the big thing is physically I'm getting to where I want to be and I'm getting, you know, I'm not, I'm not 100 percent there, but I'm 80 percent physically where, where I want to be and you know, I still got a little ways to go. Now the second half of that will be working mentally tr, trying to figure out what it is I need to do to mentally get 100 percent clarity of where,

Speaker 8:          01:04:04       um,

Speaker 4:          01:04:06       I can think is clearly as possible and deal with any of the things that have happened, whether a pre military military and after. And it is going to be a challenge because, you know, I'm trying to heal broken relationships, you know, my wife, my ex and I, um, she's with someone and very happy. So does nothIng there.

Speaker 8:          01:04:24       Um,

Speaker 4:          01:04:25       I'll always love her. You know, she was the only woman I've ever loved. And so that's there. But I want the best for her and it wasn't with me at that time and she's moved on and that's okay. It wasn't okay for me beforehand because I mentally couldn't brought us it, whereas now I can look at it objectively and say, I get it. I just want you to be happy and that's awesome, man. Good for you. But it's an attitude that, man, I wish more people would take, but it's not. It's not easy. Yeah. That's incredible. That's not easy. Now, how many other people have you turned onto this? I mean, you, you must know other guys that are suffering from similar conditions or at least you suspect they might be. Sure. Um, that's this process right now. It's part of coming on the show is we're creating a dialogue as we would like to say Because no one knows us.

Speaker 4:          01:05:13       We want to empower veterans to be able to say, hey, go into their doctor and with something just to say, hey, can you do this? Because now they don't know. And if they know they can at least start something or contact me or maybe jason now or Dr. Gordon and just get some kind of info and get it going. Um, and that's the thing, you know, we're kind of limited because it's almost like there's just a handful of people that are doing this Dr. Gordon and then a few doctors that he's trained and gone over and, you know, they're not, they're not in every state and every city and every va in every practice.

Speaker 7:          01:05:50       It seems like they're getting an attack to me. I mean, I, I got introduced at a naval special warfare event to a guy who's doing some of this work down in Texas that kerrick and, you know, you, you look him up and people are attacking him and no, this and that. And it was getting attacked by a doctor. Other doctors, people saying they were licensed to do this or, or it's experimental medicine or you know, these kinds of.

Speaker 3:          01:06:17       yeah, nothing that we're doing is experimental. It's all written about doctors are treating it whether they know it or not, you know, they're, they're treating patients who are testosterone deficient. They never go into great depth. Ask them their history because I know I get a lot of patients coming from other men's clinics type of organizations and there was a guy recently who wanted to transfer from his organization whereas from his clinic to us and I asked them to send a copy of his original labs and to make sure it wasn't about using steroids for bodybuilding or something of that nature. And he sent to the lab silver and screaming on the lab results. Very limited but significant enough you can see that he had traumatic brain injury in the past. So I called them up, use 41 years of age, called him up and introduced myself.

Speaker 3:          01:07:02       And I said, um, uh, were you ever in an accident? He said, yeah. At 18 years of age he was broadsided on the car and his head whip lash and hit the glass and broke the glass window. So we need to go and do a better job at history relative to traumatic brain injury. We're finding people who have hormonal deficiency and never ask about their history or someone comes into their doc because they're depressed and the first thing they do is they put them on drugs instead of asking them, have you had any head traumas or any slip and falls or anything? well, there's that delay effect too.

Speaker 4:          01:07:37       It doesn't have to be wrecked car onset, so when you go in there with this problem, no one's thinking to go, hey, did you have this? Because it might have happened 10 years ago, and so that's an issue with fighters. It's a big issue with fighters where I see guys who have retired and then even though they've retired, like say if they're retiring like 2010, you will see them three, four years later with no fights at all. They have deteriorated significantly over that period of time, like what it is. How long does it take? I've heard 10 years.

Speaker 3:          01:08:07       It can be up to 17 is an article that came out just recently that said that it can take 17 years and it might be that all their fights brought them up to the edge and then something silly like getting into a automobile accident, five to seven miles an hour, push them over the edge. We had someone in san diego, they had traumatic brain injury from a five to seven mile an hour rear end, but they've had history of trauma in the past. It's just how much of the hormone may lou do you have to lose before you flip into symptoms? You know, we have a lot of reserves, systems In our body, a growth hormone reserve, and when you lose that reserve, you start deteriorating from growth hormone deficiency with same thing with testosterone, estrogen, all the hormones. We have a reserved mechanism where there's a little bit hanging around and when you lose that reserve, um, you lose the battle. You then become a susceptible to all the situation, you know, the depression, the fatigue and so forth that occur. And how'd you get. How'd you guys all get involved together? How did jason get into this?

Speaker 7:          01:09:08       I looked him up.

Speaker 3:          01:09:10       You didn't look me up, looked you up on the internet. Did you really? Yeah. What would, what did you put in Mark Gordon or what?

Speaker 7:          01:09:16       No, I just, you know, I've been, I've been hanging out with these guys. I looked up ptsd, hormone therapy and your name came up, you know, a tbi, ptsd hormone therapy. Okay. And how did you hear about the hormone therapy? I've heard of some, some pretty well known a navy seal's going out and getting this therapy that clearly wasn't available to the army guys I was talking to who have never heard of this at all in any way, shape or form. And uh, you know, because this guy had some ways and means and, and was, was known. he was able to go get this therapy and is able to go get it and you know, it significantly helped his, his quality of life. And so to me, you know, this, this movie that we made is about a guy who's, who makes this huge sacrifice, you know, when he sacrifices spiritually, mentally, hIs family, everything for his beliefs.

Speaker 7:          01:10:14       And he comes home and he's, he's got to fight another war, you know, this guy fought as hard to get home as he fought over there and uh, and I just feel like we're looking at this thing and it's kinda like the public is just standing outside of glass and banging their head on it. everyone's like, well, why are these guys shootIng themselves? They hear the statistic that are like, why are these guys putting guns in their mouth? So I don't get it. They're not even asking that question. Just the general public is completely ignorant to it. I mean, the average person you walked down the street and say how many soldiers killed themselves? They would have no idea that it would be as many, if not more than that stigma I was telling you about. You say you have ptsd or something and they meet, whoa, we need to lock you up. You know, there's that mentality that now you're dangerous. And it's so. I think they, it's, you know, ignorance is bliss. Let's just snow. It's hard to talk about. It's hard to like, it's hard to dig in, you know? And it's hard to, we have this thing where we're like, thank you for your service and it's the polite thing say, and it kind of

Speaker 6:          01:11:13       also puts a hand up at the same time. You're like, thanks for your service. I don't really want to know what you saw or what you did, you know. And a lot of the guys correct me if I'm wrong, who served or like, hey, you wouldn't thank me if you knew what I had to do here. You know? And, and it's uh, it, it kind of prevents conversation in a way. Well, there's also that movement out there and it's not support the troops, you know, and it kind of, I mean, I remember coming back a few times and seeing protests and it's, it doesn't anger me, but it was a, a situation of it's like you, if you just knew this wouldn't be what you're doIng right now. So convenient to protest it mean just saying that you support the troops and just saying that you, you know, you want them to come back home is really support the troops come back home.

Speaker 6:          01:12:00       But that's all. That's very convenient. It's very correct. You know, we all would like less war in this world, but the reality of supporting the troops and the reality of the protesting as you're dealing with these people that have gone through something that you're never going to be able to comprehend, it is absolutely impossible for you to be able to comprehend just psychologically what they're dealing with and to add in this physical aspect of it. The traumatic brain injury, the loss of hormones, the the loss of the ability to cope because of this hormonal deficiencies. There's so much going on. there's so much going on and when you see people protesting, getting upset at troops, you're talking about kids. You're talking about 18 year old kids that are in unbelievably easily influenced that are sent over there and essentially brainwashed. You're immediately thrown into your.

Speaker 6:          01:12:46       You're thrown into these training courses that treat you how to block things out, how to become a trained killer, and then they come back and people want to protest against them. Like what do you expect them to be unbelievably unique and be able to deal with this and process it in some sort of a strange and very unusual way where they don't they, they become a conscientious objector. They step outside of it. I mean, when I see people protesting the actual soldiers themselves, it's very maddening because that could have been me. It could've been a lot of us. It was you and it could have been anybody who joins the military and that that shit drives me fucking crazy that you're blaming the soldiers for what happens. It's one of the, one of the most infuriating things and I've seen it time and time again.

Speaker 6:          01:13:33       It's so easy to do and it's so short sighted when there's also no course when you get, when you're getting. I mean really, there's no. I mean they do all these training things to help you deal with getting out, but there's no like magic course that you take and all of a sudden you can fucking deal with life again. I mean, you're used to a structured life almost every day. Have you do this at 6:00 in the morning? You do this at 10:00 in the morning, you do, you do this, you eat here, you eat when they tell you this much, you do this, and then you go over there and you're doIng the same kind of. You do these routines, you do these routines and then you get out and you're literally left to just fucking figure it out. Guys say that about prison as well. Yeah. Well why? A lot of guys want to go back

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       to prison. I mean I've known people who have gotten out, couldn't handle it and went back in because they were so used to that structure life. It almost is that kind of indoctrination of when you're 18 in a way because that's all they've known and they're still babies at 18. They don't, you know, maybe that's just how life was. That's just what they know and they go back and it's comfortable. It's comfortable. Yeah. Three or four years ago they had a strategy. Anyone coming into the military had to go through assessment and then when they exit they're supposed to go through some kind of exit assessment. Is thAt being done? Don't know. You don't know collIns, I think doing it, yeah, you always go in with some kind of a, a basic assessment physically just to see if you meet certain criteria. Um, but when you get out, I mean, so as like a person who is in charge of most of the team's health type of thing.

Speaker 4:          01:15:07       You do like physicals, you do their lab work, you do all this stuff for them. But um, yeah, I mean if it checks out, you just go, okay, you're good to go. I mean, you're not, I'm not doing anything extensive that needs to be done. Do they give you any psychological counseling about like how to reintegrate to society, how to deal with protests, how to deal with people calling you a baby killer or whatever the fuck Vietnam? Uh, I, no, not you go through like things where you have classes, like when you're a pqs and out or however you want to call it. Um, that just, you know, that teach you basic skills to how to get out of reintegrate into the world, but I mean it's very basic on like you can learn like job skills. I mean, I didn't personally do any of those courses.

Speaker 4:          01:15:57       I did different things, but they have these things for them and you go through these things but nothing like. And can you train anyone really to how to deal with being called a baby killer? I mean, you can't, I guess. I mean you just, I don't know. Well yeah, we put all this money into training them to fight it and then no money into training them to find peace. It's a very good way of putting it. Yeah. The internal piece that they need, that we need. And there's this uh, I don't know, you know, I look at the met, I've been doing a lot of thinking of the medication lately and stuff like that, just because I can't believe everything that I've been given and you know, it is, it's like there's a market in this ptsd thing right now and it's just like everyone's coming back.

Speaker 4:          01:16:37       If you have this symptom or that symptom, you go in there and you fall under this blanket of that and they're, they're gonna put you in there and you're not getting out of it because no one's going to look any farther than that and that past to change. They, they're treating everything backwards and so who knows, man, that's the info. Just needs to get out there. Well, I think this is going to help, but obviously it helped you the first time. I'm Dr. Gordon talked about it in the podcast that you heard. For sure. Yeah, I mean I deeply indebted that you have people on here that are coming in and sharing new ideas or just things that people need to hear. Um, yeah. I mean this. Yeah. I have no idea. I mean I could be dead right now if that hadn't happened because I mean let's be frank are probably would be dead and that in a way probably needed to happen for me to get enough courage to say this is something I need to try.

Speaker 4:          01:17:33       I mean, I had nothing, nothing to lose by applying or nothing to lose about coming down here and just seeing what was going on and trying nothing to lose. And the problem right now is we need to get money so that we can help people. We need funding, we need to get the word out there. Um, we're trying to get a non charitable going so that we can get donations, things like that. Um, you've been a nonprofit five, zero, one c, three non charitable or thinking of charity in my head and I'm just so people can get money because how many people are on a waiting list

Speaker 3:          01:18:12       right now? We have about 28 and we just got another to sober up to 30. ThAt's just your practice and how many people like you are doing this all over the country. We not just know fornia, no one. Jesus jason looked. I've got a couple of people who have looked. There's no one else doing it and now they're doing some very basic hormone because since 2004, I've been going around the world lecturing on traumatic brain injury and hormone deficiency syndrome, but it doesn't have the nuances that are in there, so they start off by giving. Just to start from. One of the issues with just giving testosterone is we have a mechanism in our body. If you give a hormone or a chemical into the body that's normally there, it shuts off the origin of that chemical. So upstream precursors are shut off. So in testosterone, the two very important upstream precursors or pregnenolone and dah da. So it takes about four to six Months before you shut off those two and they affect the brain. So what you'll see in patients who are just put on testosterone is that they'll start complaining that they're not experiencing the same effect. They're losing the benefit and the commonest thing that's done is they increase the amount of testosterone, increased the amount of estrogen. They get bitch tits, and they get, you know, feminine kind of attitudes and so forth.

Speaker 2:          01:19:26       What are you trying to say by feminine? Well, how dare you. I've got three daughters, you know, what are you trying to say? You're going to get the feminist as well. As long as they're pretty. That's pretty feminists. You just said jumbo tron, military intelligence. So I think it took huge balls for you to come down here and do this too. I had no idea. Was was

Speaker 4:          01:19:51       three months. Like. Honestly, that's fucking awesome. It think that's a success story, but you know, it's just how many other people do we need to have the same thing so they can wake up and there's guys, there's guys out there suffering, man, you know, we have a captain families, you know captain

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       who is. I'm 21 years after his initial, a traumatic brain injury and five weeks he was 70 percent better. He gets better. He gets redeployed to Afghanistan because he's better at for a year. He comes back and he's up in the eightY percent improvement. Ninety percent now he's been a have five shaped building in Washington over wherever he is and he's trying to help to find the avenue for us. Because you know, he's living, breathing proof that what we do is it works and it is very simple basics, back to the basics, replace the hormones that are deficient and protect the brain and it works. And the other thing is that we're missing or things like alzheimer's disease, we talked about traumatic brain injury. We think it's just blunt injury to the head while ionizing radiation from excessive x-rays, ct scans, regular dental x rays, skull x rays can cause damage to the control mechanism in the brain called the hypothalamus.

Speaker 3:          01:21:04       I'm also subdural hematomas, which is bleeding in the brain from like, boxing has now been associated with all the same symptoms and hormonal deficiencies akin to traumatic brain injury. So strokes or it's another one, um, surgery. Uh, I have, uh, one of the robin williams issue that this is that now there was one article that came out that started looking at this, uh, where there are some 20,700 articles that had been written on. I knoW that because I use something called google scholar and it tells you in zero point zero, one seconds, it pulled up, you know, 20,700 articles and you put in, um, cabbage, which is coronary artery bypass graph and depression, and you see 20,700 articles come up talking about postsurgical post heart surgery, um, depression and robin williams in 2009 had a major heart surgery on an air valve replacement. And now what we're also finding is that thyroid changes the thyroid production in the body changes after prolonged surgery and it generates a form of thyroid hormone that's inactive and associated with low thyroid is depression associated with damage to the pituitary from prolonged surgery is hormonal shutdown.

Speaker 3:          01:22:24       So I believe that it probably is, you know, contributory, especially when the pathologist came out and said that there were no drugs and no medication, no alcohol, no medication in his blood, but of course they're not going to look at the hormone may loop to see if there was a deficiency. Low levels of testosterone leads to depression, and you can find a 70,000 articles in this chapter on neuropsychiatry and traumatic brain injury. There are 432,000 articles on growth, hormone deficiency and depression. There are 235,000 articles on thyroid. 70,000 on testosterone, a dah da has about 17,000. Estrogen has a large amount of progesterone. All have depression articles that have been written since 2000 2013, almost 850,000 articles. What? No. Instead just producing it. They're just publishing them to publish it and no one's reading them. So essentially what we're dealing with when it comes to happiness and avoiding depression is the entire body as a unit, as an individual unit has to be balanced.

Speaker 3:          01:23:31       Correct? You have to be healthy, you have to have the proper nutrients, you have to have rest and exercise, and you have to have your hormones in line. If they are not in line, you're going to deal with all sorts of issues, compensatory issues, depression, the all the buffers that caused you to lash out, to not lash out. All those are gone, correct? Yeah. This is a crazy thing to talk about. I'm starting to revenue, but it's just. It seems like there's a rush to get this information out here while these 40 soldiers of killing themselves a day and we're just talking about soldiers were not dealing with people in car accidents. People will kick box, you know, the people have played football that are all dealing with thiS. There's a lot going on here. There's more than enough going on and the resistance of the industry, my industry and the medical industry is what is perplexing on one part because we went through, you know, medical school and hopefully we all read the hippocratic oath and we're supposed to serve the betterment of humanity and trying to help fix them. And I don't think that's being done. I don't think it's really being focused on. I think unfortunately I believe that we're more pawns in a game of chess where pharmaceutical companies are dictating to the insurance companies. Insurance companies are dictating to both the patients and to the physicians on how to run medicine so that you walk into your office and you know you're no longer an individual, you're just a number on a card, but the pen will dial bill.

Speaker 7:          01:25:03       Yeah. The people getting this treatment are the rich 45 year old white guys who can afford it, who are all on testosterone, who are all finding some benefit to their, to their, to their body and mind,

Speaker 3:          01:25:18       but even that is not being done correctly. It doesn't sound like it's being done correctly at all. It's they're doing it as an entry point. I mean, I've been giving classes on andropause which is testosterone deficiency amount of pause, which is growth hormone deficiency and menopause and how to balance female hormones a little better since 2001 and a lot of docs are listened to it. A lot of docs went into the industry to make money and therefore they go to one class, one class for three days, like I just participated in and they walk out and they are the expert. I don't consider myself an expert on anything. I think I know a little bit and try not to get in trouble by keep on reading so I know a little bit more. and what I do is I go out and I share this information I'm at and uh, when I was in chicago at a, you know, teaching in medical school there and that's just my personality.

Speaker 3:          01:26:10       I read a lot and I find ways to deliver it so it's palatable and usable in a very relatively short period of time. But you have to change, you know, unfortunately since 2008, everything is financially oriented. So I've put my family life and the quality of my life partially on the line because I try to make it so that my office comes as close as possible to breaking even and my outside lecturing, whatever is what really I get my sound. You put in the wrong place, uh, to, uh, to, for, to be able to do it. And our pricing, I mean, the laboratory tests, uh, patients are paying a third of the average. I'm medical director of education for the laboratory in the lab has put a lot into what I do. They support what I do by matching the funds that I personally put into it so that people like matt and I have some patients who are not in the military, not in law enforcement and other areas of government government who are just great cases that I want to, you know, I want to see it work and it works and I can back this.

Speaker 3:          01:27:17       I know you do this because I know you very well and this is a real labor of love for you. This is a very important thing for you. This is not just lip service. This is something that you've. From the moment I met you, you've been very adamant about this and it's because of guys like matthew and this is one of the reasons why you wanted to bring matthew in here and you. You contacted me right after he started treating him and right after he started experiencing positive results and I could tell that this was something that was very important to you, which is why we brought mathieu in here to discuss this. Right. And I'll tell you, jason is in an arena where I've been trying diligently for the past three, four years to get some champion for what we're doing. Someone in the entertainment world to step in and to pick this up and to spread the word to spread, help spread the word, you know, I think without saying their names, some of the people in the industry that I, um, I see I work with could do it, but they don't want to be looked at as being out there on the fringe because I'm.

Speaker 3:          01:28:16       Even though I'm in core medicine, everything I do is called evidence based. Every single thing I do is An article and you know, I have a collection of 7,000, $400 articles that I've gone through in the past 10 years that address each area. And you know, colleagues says, you know, I'd like to see an article on testosterone and heart with that craziness that was going on. So I sent them my portfolio with, you know, 600 articles about heart and testosterone and all the benefits. So there are thousands of articles, benefit of testosterone in the heart, and you come up with these three bullshit articles that you know, try to taint the benefits that testosterone. And we had one of the, one of the top guys in harvard, dr abraham mergenthaler wrote the book testosterone for life that refutes testosterone causing cancer. He came to us in the beginning of the year to an organization called age management medical group and phenomenal dissertation on the bullshit of these articles showing that they show a three percent, they report a three percent increase in coronary artery disease, greater heart attack onto stastrom when the actual statistic showed a 30 percent improvement, but the way they picked and choosed everything.

Speaker 6:          01:29:23       But hOw, how is it the fringe? These guys don't want to be perceived as being on the fringe, but they're coming to you as patients. Well, it's, that's what I, you know, personal and public, right? It's about personal image and paulo, but how do you, how do you push this thing across the line so it's not fringe.

Speaker 3:          01:29:40       I've been on the phone with them frequently trying to get them if they don't want to stand up and be a participant, direct me to someone directly,

Speaker 6:          01:29:48       stuff like this. I think. Yeah. I think stuff like this, especially something like this where it's a long form, uninterrupted conversation, you could really get deep into the facts and the reality and your anecdotal experience. Controversy is not new to you. Yeah. Everything I do is controversial. I don't worry about it. What's the hottest controversy are in right now? I don't know if it's cage fighting, forcing people to eat animal. Dick's dirty jokes. I mean a pot advocacy. I mean I don't have a single thing that I do that doesn't have somebody hating me, so it's okay enough yet, but I've been through after everything I'm saying though. No, I think we're good at everything. I'm saying no. W, w, w regardless of whatever it is, whatever the subject is. This was what I truly believe. I don't have any other motivations, so I'm fine with the controversy and I think hormones have a stigma in this country because of barry ponds and fucking sammy sosa and all this crazy shit where everybody's like, oh, this fucking cheaters in baseball.

Speaker 6:          01:30:45       They ruined everything and sports and everyone is so concerned with what we hear about with cheating and steroids and athletic performance. That means you're missing out on a core essential aspect of being a human being. Being a man, especially the lack of testosterone directly related to depression, directly related to these. These people that start hitting age regardless of traumatic brain injury, they start getting older and they feel like fucking shit. They feel like shit and I've talked to a lot of them. They get on testosterone and all of a sudden their glow again. They have energy. They want to start doing things. There are active and someone I've talked to, guys who are on testosterone that don't like to talk about it because they're worried that someone's going to look at them first of all as being inferior because they need to add artificial testosterone to their system and that they might be a roid head. Now they might be a cheater and some like, what are you fucking playing? You're 55 years old, are you playing major league baseball beHind my back with life? You're life cheater. You're doing too good with these new. meanwhile you'll take aspirin if you have a fucking headache, you take ibuprofen, you'll take medication if you're sick, like why won't you take testosterone? Why won't you get your hormone levels change? I have a very good friend that won't do it because he's afraid of all these other things,

Speaker 7:          01:32:07       bro. You look like shit and you're tired all the time. Right? Like what are you worried about? But the, and the difference to me is like us being there and these guys who like I sat down with a guy two weeks ago, wrote a script about a metal for the first time. Lovely guy, like the sweetest, sweetest, nicest guy, loves the fish and all this and I'm like, so how is it like we really get down to basics. He's like, it's good man, it's good, but some days I just have to find a reason to go on living and you're just like, you understand at that point how different it is for these guys, how much more drastic it is, how much more important it is to reach out to these guys and, and

Speaker 6:          01:32:51       somebody's got to do it. Well, this is a subject is very near and dear to my heart, both because I know a lot of guys in the military from martial arts and just from life in general and I know a lot of guys have had head trauma from fighting and I've had a bunch of head trauma myself. So explains it. Yeah, I'm sure there's some bad shit going on. There must be. It doesn't make any sense, but it's a, it's a subject that's very near and dear to my heart. And once we started getting into it and we started discussing it, it was very confusing to me that it wasn't hearing this echoed in other places. And when sometimes when you hear things and you don't hear it echoed in other places, you say, well, maybe I'm talking to a crackpot. Maybe this guy's fucking crazy. It's just try to get everybody on the juice.

Speaker 6:          01:33:34       But when you look, when you research it and you find the, all the hypocrisy and the contradictions involved in the, the counteracting of it or the, uh, the people who are against it, you start realizing like, wow, this is not a rationally approach subject. This is a subject that for whatever reason is either the people who were talking about it or ignorant of it, they don't have personal experience in it. They don't have, they don't have a conversation with a guy like you that has spent decades working on this stuff. There's, this is not. This is not a really well understood subject for a lot of physicians.

Speaker 3:          01:34:16       They don't have pharmaceutical reps coming in and telling them that they need to replace testosterone for whatever reason. We're stArting to see it with an issue, right? The pharmaceutical reps coming into the offices. What? Which doesn't make any sense because there are what? The underarm deodorant to testosterone. There's the rub on deodorant, testosterone. It's a. It looks like an underarm deodorant thing to try to avoid contaminating your loved ones with excessive amount of testosterone cream. Put all of your body. We don't use any creams per se, except for fun issues. Well, don't take how dare you. Don't. The creams have also some sort of an absorption issue as well. Well, what happens is when you put a cream, a 10 percent or five percent gel or cream of testosterone and skin, the little hair follicles have an enzyme in it that converted from testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which is the active form of testosterone that you want in the cell, not floating around in the blood to cause loss of hair.

Speaker 3:          01:35:13       At one point in my head, motherfucking loss, loss of hair, shrinkage of the testicles pointed me again. Plenty large was set over there at your monster over there. The werewolf and the world will and a enlargement of the prostate. Uh, you know, for women, enlargement of the clutter is not bad. It's an imbalance, an imbalance or lack of dht along with the too much dht instead of having free testosterone that you need to get into the brain. So we have, we're interacting with some other delivery technologies, uh, aside from injectable and topical, uh, that increases the amount of testosterone that gets into the brain and we see the major benefits in our tbi and, or a head trauma, neuro trauma patients where they do phenomenally well. So it seems that, well, it doesn't seem that there's a whole panel of things that have to be balanced out in order for you to have a said happy body.

Speaker 3:          01:36:17       You said at the beginning of a holistic approach, you need to have physical activity and nutrition and you have to have a balance of everything you take into your body. Whether or not it's A medication or a hormone or a mineral or vitamin. You sent me another thing. This is very important to talk about because I sent it to a buddy who was experiencing some depression that you sent me, something about propecia or [inaudible] or whatever, the finasteride finasteride and dressed drive direction that has been shown to cause depression in people and I have a buddy who got on that shit and he was experiencing some hair loss. Get on that shit and became really, really depressed. The reason being is that to stop when it gets into the brain, goes through a cascade of changes from testosterone to dihydrotestosterone 300 scenic diane, and then it stimulates a chemical called adenyl cyclase, which gives us our upgrade feeling.

Speaker 3:          01:37:10       And when you block the conversion of testosterone, dht, you lose all that stuff down the road. So you can have issues with anger, depression. We have a couple of people who were developed it within a short period of time, like 18 months on the finance finasteride and, uh, had to put them onto hcg little clomid and a little testosterone. Six months, they're back in line. They were depressed, they'd lost their libido. And it's because the effect of dht and testosterone, the brain, testosterone and growth hormone also work in an area of the brain for memory recall, and the ability to learn new things called the hippocampus also are panoramic vision and our panoramic memories. So you look at something panoramic or you have a sequence of, of, um, of memories that you can lose if you lose your testosterone in the perry campus area of the brain, it also kills your dick like pesticide.

Speaker 3:          01:38:05       Oh, dah di, that fucking that print finasteride stuff. Oh yeah. That's because dht is important. Testosterone's important dht in the brain. So when you use stuff that converts the dht in from the application on the skin, it gets into the blood but doesn't get into the brain. So you have to generate your dht in the brain, in the cells, not in the blood. And when I look at people who are on some of the topical products out there, you see free testosterone's good. Total testosterone is outrageously high. Dht is sky high. And they're wondering why their hair's falling out in handfuls. Almost their testicles are disappearing or else, you know. But they are straight strengths up strength from dhd, but it's this, this pill that makes your hair fall out. I mean that's like, that's one of those things like if someone could come up with a pill that makes you, that keeps your hair from falling out, boy, that's a, that's a very popular thing.

Speaker 3:          01:38:57       And then you look at the side effects. I was like, don't give it a pregnant woman. Your fucking kids going to be fucked up if she touches it. Like you can't even touch it if you're a pregnant woman. Like don't take something that a woman can't even touch when she's pregnant. And the reason is that they found that d, h, d helps to distinguish the brain's gender orientation, dht, dihydrotestosterone, gender orientation, so that you can have externally a, a, you know, a male body. But If female mentality woe and it's biochemical. so do you think that this is a maybe possibly related to transgender people that are there that say they were born a man physically but they brought born the wrong sex dht related? I think it's, that's it. It's not. I don't believe in the social, cultural reasons for it, you know, someone becoming a homosexual or lesbian is, you know, as a ptsd kind of response.

Speaker 3:          01:39:56       I use the data. A gal who was a lesbian who would just go out. No, it was my goal to fix her if she needed to be who she was, but she had been raped. I'm kidding. yeah, I know you were. She had been raped multiple times when she lived in this country. That's always conflicting over there in the east area. Okay. Now, okay. And uh, I don't know what you're saying, but middle east area and you know, that country that everyone's picking on because it's a warmonger income country and creates all the wars. Syria, Israel, Israel. So she was raped in Israel bite. Oh god. Some people there. And um, she feared men, she had a ptsd. Every time she got close with the guy, she would freak out and she didn't have it with women. And that was, you know, the pts. But I think, uh, you know, they say it's a choice.

Speaker 3:          01:40:45       Well, I don't think it's a choice in all the cases. I think in the transgender they were put into the wrong body. Their mindset was in the wrong body or their body was right. The mindset was treated with hormones that created the, the other gender, and they're fulfilling it by transgender surgery. You know, I worked in Thailand for the past, uh, four years going back to starting the project and was exposed to a lot of the transgender or the gender reassignment individuals relative to hormones. And um, there were people who were in the wrong body. I mean their physical expression in the opposite. Then sex they were born in was obviously the wrong body and they went through surgery to have things corrected for them.

Speaker 6:          01:41:31       And do you think this is related to these hormones in the wound?

Speaker 3:          01:41:35       I think it's hormones. It could be, you know, alcohol, cocaine, crack, meth, any kind of chemistry that is introduced to the woman's body during that very frightful period of time, the first seven weeks where everything starts developing and the change in hormones, whether or not it's externally introduced or internally manufactured because of things that they've been taken into their body like alcohol, which can alter chemistry or smoking weed that can cause an elevation. Esther dialed levels. And if you have elevation to dial dial levels in a, in a male, you can predispose them to be female brain, physiologically male, female in mental.

Speaker 6:          01:42:14       This is an issue that a lot of people get very emotional about when you're talking about transgender folks. And yes, and when you break it down to a chemical relationship and you break it down to this, what, what you're saying about the introduction of the certain chemicals in the womb, people resist this information.

Speaker 3:          01:42:33       Yes they do. They like to say that, you know, they're always female. Uh, they want to be female or male or male. Sorry, I just preference or female regardless. But um, yeah, it's a very heated, very emotional because you don't want to have that doubt that they were a male. You want to eliminate the fact that they were a male and that there are female, as you know, in, in mma. The situation that's going on,

Speaker 6:          01:43:02       the situation that I'm involved in, well I'm involved in it because I was one of many people that thought it was incorrect. There's a woman that was born a man. She was a man for 30 years and then had gender reassignment surgery two years later. It was fighting women in mma fights. Never fought as a man and he's fighting and beating the fuck out of these checks and not letting them know. The first two, at least that she used to be a man, which I thought was just completely incorrect. And I based it on my knowledge of martial arts, my knowledge of things like the size of hands and shoulders and the different relationship that the body parts of the hips, there's the, there's the structure of a male body is very different. And then if you take steroids, one of the things about steroids that's hugely problematic, people that cheated and then don't cheat anymore is that when you cheat, when you take steroids, and I'm not talking just about testosterone and talking to them like real radical steroids and a lot of people taken you enact permanent changes to your body, not just permanent changes, but permanent changes that improve the performance of your body forever.

Speaker 6:          01:44:12       You there, there's been many studies that have come out recently that people have taken steroids, you know, x amount of years ago and been off them for a long time, still have the benefits of taking those steroids. If you've taken 30 years of testosterone in a male frame, I'm a male frame which has different tendons, which has different, uh, different jaw structure which changes your ability to absorb punishment. Two years of estrogen therapy. How much of that is going to change that

Speaker 3:          01:44:43       externally? It'll change. Estrogen has a counteract some of the Benefits of testosterone. So the question is, is there also supplementation of testosterone at the same time, it taking estrogen or are they using gas testosterone to convert into estrogen as a means of getting their estrogen? You'd have to look at how they're being treated and you know, their personal selection of what cocktail of hormones that are taking. Usually what happens is [inaudible] acetate is a drug that's used to block the androgen receptors so that a woman can develop the or transgender woman can develop the softness and the femininity of her body. But if the individual, the transgender female as a female maintains a lot of the muscle striations and contours of a male, then they're probably not getting adequate amount of estrogen or they're supplementing with one form of another, of either testosterone or deco or nandrolone or a loan. Um, what androgen, a nfr some of the other dht like products. So it'd be interesting to find out what the chemistry, the bIochemistry is the individual, but you're right, muscle muscle response, time, absorption, hips, tendons, cartilage and joints, resilience, thickness of the bone. Men have more dense bones, more dense jaws than women. Um, mIndset. The aggression, there's a totally different direction. Imprinting, imprinting right from that 30 years. Men are different for a lot of ways. The way we analyze things,

Speaker 6:          01:46:24       so we're not fair, but when it comes to bone density, um, african american women have similar bone density to white men.

Speaker 3:          01:46:32       Correct. For whatever reason, my significant other is a dentist and would share with me over the past 30 some odd years about the difference between different racial groups and the african american have much thicker bones, much thicker bones comparable to a male or female to male, yes.

Speaker 6:          01:46:52       And astrogen. In taking estrogen post transition transition, estrogen allows the bone density to remain because estrogen, which is one of the issues in osteoporosis, is when women go through menopause, their body stops producing estrogen, so their bones lack density. So in giving a transgender male estrogen, it actually preserves bone density, so keeps them with a male.

Speaker 3:          01:47:18       That's correct. They don't lose it as long as they're making sure that not only vitamin d but extra dial testosterone growth hormone all help with bone density. In fact, a growth hormone works about point one point six percent increase in bone density in a year, so it raises the bone density. We have patients who are growth hormone deficient with thinning of the bones. We put them back on physiologic dosing of growth on, you see in six months to a year that bone density responds where in using some of the medication that are out there, which I won't name, you know, can take, I'm 23 years,

Speaker 6:          01:47:52       and bone density is also altered by weightlifting, correct?

Speaker 3:          01:47:57       Correct. The body responds through pulling. I mean people. The most common, abnormal, uh, example of that are either achilles tendon spurs or plantar fasciitis spurs from pulling a muscle or tendon on bone. It stimulates more bone to be made. So if you're stressing the bones is really what it is, you increase the density. So if you look at people who are sedentary, drink alcohol, blonde, blue eyed, male or female, you'll see scandinavian study. You'll see that their bone density is less than people who are dark skinned, dark haired, and physically active. These are things that helped maintain and promote denser bone.

Speaker 6:          01:48:37       What happens to tendon strength and things along those lines, because tendons play a vital role in striking in, in combat sports.

Speaker 3:          01:48:45       That's right. Uh, specifically about tendons I can't answer other than the muscle. IT improves the muscle in muscles are connected to tendons. Tendons are a inert kind of tissue. It's the muscle that pull on the tendon. So it's the muscle issue, but the muscles decreased with estrogen therapy. They can do decrease with estrogen therapy, but if they're also on something that puts back testosterone, you can generate a balance. So they get some softening, but they don't lose the muscle. And then estrogen, you'd have to look at the biochemistry of it to really answer it because if you're being strict on the process of total transgender transformation, you need to give them lots of estrogen in diminished the testosterone which competes with the estrogen. So if you want to be a dominant estrogen dominant to be a female estrogen dominant, then you have to wipe out the testosterone.

Speaker 6:          01:49:38       Well, this has been such a highly charged and emotional discussion and it becomes a transphobic or an anti transgender more than it becomes an argument of fairness involving a sport where the very goal is to use your body to hurt somebody else and if you have some sort of just natural physiological advantages over that person because you were born male, not because you're. I meAn this is a spectrum involving women. There's some women that are very feminine, very petite, and there's some women that are very thIck and very physically strong just naturally, but from the womb, you know, no added hormones, no added anything. So. but the idea is that that's mitigated by weight classes. The idea is that a 135 pound woman in 135 pound woman, you know, they're both 135 pounds. They're pre, whether they're, you know, there's variations, but pretty close, let's, let's have them compete against each other. But 135 pound man versus 135 pound woman. Very different. One hundred and 35 pound transitioning man to transgender woman. Still different than a biologic,

Speaker 3:          01:50:48       a woman, they would have undue disadvantage. The competitor, female natural born, digital born female, would have undue disadvantage against a transgender female from male to female. Genetically, you know, you're always going to be a male genetically, so it means that the biochemistry, when you put these things into it, the body wIll respond to preference male, unless you totally put in chemistry to, uh, to stop that. And that's that cypress.

Speaker 6:          01:51:20       But let's assume that they even do put the chemicals in to stop that. Would they still have significant advantages in any area?

Speaker 3:          01:51:27       Yes. For a timeframe they would. Until the optimal effects that you're looking for by giving estrogen for softening the musculature, take effect.

Speaker 6:          01:51:37       well, it's still, there's a 10 percent benefit that men have over women, like across the board and reaction time. Would that still be a factor if they had transitioned to a woman?

Speaker 3:          01:51:49       I really don't know. That answer

Speaker 6:          01:51:52       is. There probably hasn't been that many studies on this as well.

Speaker 3:          01:51:54       I think the biggest problem in this one case that you're talking about is that there's really no precedences, no wealth of documentation where they've actually looked at someone who goes from male to female and gets into some male sports within and not wrestling or grappling or mma or whatever the situation is. Or baseball was there. Someone recently went into transitional. Went into a sport

Speaker 6:          01:52:19       that cyclist. Yeah. Michelle, do more ask. Yeah. This, it's a fascinating story. She transitioned. She had sex reassignment surgery, became a woman, and started competIng in biking in, and in her first she, she entered a novice female class. Her first finish was two point five seconds faster than the winner of the professional female category. She went on to win the fall in 2002. She, uh, she was awarded a license to race in the women's category. Three weekS later, she entered her first race in the pro woman's class, finished third the following week. She plays first beating her compete competition by 10 seconds. And this is, you know, a novice, a person who's just just entering into this world of professional racing and she's just stomping these women a wave of protests and sued and petition was created and signed by female and a few male racers asking her to be dIsqualified because she had a race licensed.

Speaker 6:          01:53:18       The request was denied. So it became this huge controversy. Um, and you know, this is another example of someone who has an unfair physical advantage or is thought to have that tech chemically. Um, there's another problem with this is that there's a lot of confirmation bias about this and there's a lot of emotions. They're riding on this. And this person who we're talking about, the person in question has become essentially a poster boy for transgender rights and transgender acceptance. And I couldn't think of a worst possible example. It's one thing to say, hey, you know, this person wants their own personal freedom to be living their life. As a woman. Do you accept that? Absolutely. Change your name, change whatever, whatever you want, but when you're asking for that, right? But you're entering into combat sports with natural born females and literally beating the shit out of them. Boy, that gets really fucking tricky. That gets really tricky.

Speaker 3:          01:54:16       So what do you think the resolve will be? Have a separate organization that only deals with transgender. That's the best way. I mean, that's probably the best way to professional. I mean that's the. But if there's a point at which the body, the body provides homeostasis as a woman after doing all that testing. Isn't, isn't that measurable? It's measurable, but It's going to take a long time. They might be in their seventies by the time it takes. So it takes. Yeah, but the point is they're genetically there. Whatever you throw into their body, their body's going to respond to it as their original gender. so the testosterone that you're talking about, the problem that people have that I've talked to is if I start taking this thing, I'm going to have to take it the rest of my life. If you're deficient, I used to get this for the past 14 years.

Speaker 3:          01:55:09       You're a diabetic who needs insulin, right? What are you going to do? Rest of your life. Correct. Same thing with testosterone. Thyroid. I'm committed to my thyroid for the rest of my life because without it I gained weight. My thought processes are slowed down and now I race all the time. Brain wise it's. So you have to treat it like a, like a disorder, a disease. It's a deficiency syndrome. Efficiency. Yeah. To do, you know, I don't understand why, you know, my colleagues tend to isolate it just as you, you know, positioned it. If you're deficient, you replace your replace or replenish it. bringing it back to where the normal love. Liz, the other thing is we have developed a statistical models for at 20 years of age, you need this amount of hormone at 40 this mount which is less and at 60 this amount, what do we replace everything to one word, the healthiest between 25 and 35 and that's the premise of our practice and that's why we get the responses we do. We don't return a 70 year old to the average 70 year old level because they weren't getting any benefit in the past. So we bring them to a level that has the, the peak of it.

Speaker 2:          01:56:17       Do you have a seven year old wives coming in and go, let's do one stop fucking man. We fucking dose back. Jesus christ.

Speaker 3:          01:56:23       I had a. You brought it up, you brought it up. Ninety four year old guy comes in with a walker. Rice 94 year old guy comes in on a walker, was brought in by one guy that I talked about, keith and he'd been using the walker for about 17 years. Comes in, come in, and we put them on two hormones now in the past I would draw the blood, get results and then starting. But he had a classical syndrome called the frailty syndrome. He was holding onto the walker and shaking because he didn't have muscle tone to support his own body. That is classical, uh, fatigue syndrome. So I put them onto a middle of the road treatment protocol, low dose regiment, and waited for the labs, come back, told him to come back in six weeks, came back in six weeks and we started them, you know, reviewed the labs and he was on appropriate mount and drew blood again to monitor him. And we chit chatted a little bit. And as he started leaving the room, he turns to me and says, oh, by the way, Dr. Gordon, I probably should tell you, I finally had sex with my 60 year old girlfriend. And that tells you that at replacing the hormone, that psychologically you have to be psychologically attuned to want to have sex. You can't just have sex because the brain is, you know, not with you physiologically. everything that has to be working in physically, you have to have the moves.

Speaker 2:          01:57:44       Well, that's what he did to me. He's got some. The other thing is he

Speaker 3:          01:57:47       carried his walker in. He knew it, didn't walk on it. He carried it in under his arm. And I said to herman, I said to herman, uh, why are you carrying the walk? He says, well, I've used it for 17 years. I've had to continue using it. I said, did you use it today? He says, no, so we'll leave it home. He says, but I'm afraid I might fall.

Speaker 2:          01:58:06       He's committed to his walker. Like, you're committed to your thyroid. Absolutely. So, um, I think it's different. That's like if he needed, he didn't need the thyroid, he's still taking it with them. How about levitra or stylists or something like that? It does help your testosterone does allegedly allegedly know anything about it? So the answer is yes. You've had some 90 year old dudes. Fucking the shit out there. I shouldn't say it like that. Well, no. Um, what, what, um, if you ever had negative responses, people, you've put them on some of a hormone replacement protocol and that becomes issues. Absolutely. What are those?

Speaker 3:          01:58:44       Um, let's see, uh, a gentleman who was put onto 60 milligrams a week of testosterone and all they wanted to do is have sex with anything that walked. Uh, so we had a lower them down to 40 milligrams, three patients who had a panic attack because this process of testosterone in the brain going to this thing called adenyl cyclase. If it's the wrong person or too much relative to their body, they can get a panic attack, which I've had in three patients. You load those in, disappears. What is, what's causing the panic attack? It's a chemical called adenyl cyclase, which is like a stimulate in the brain, just, it just pushes you over the edge.

Speaker 2:          01:59:24       So is it that they have so much testosterone and then their body thinks, well, we must have, we must be in a dangerous area. Is that why we have. Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:59:32       it's relative. Hormones are relative. It's not absolute. You can't say 100 is what everybody uses. You know there are people who need 20 milligrams. I have one gal that the average production of a woman in a week is about 20 milligrams. She would use 20 milligrams a month and she meet her it by her libido. so average weekly dose she used every month because she was super sensItive to it. Women, when they get on testosterone, get super horny, they get assertive, which is great. They get allegedly, it was mostly living with them. The confidence, assertiveness a, they start feeling great. They absolutely feel better, a competitive and it's all degrees of. It's all acceptable degrees of and when you overtreat them then you get into, I want to be fucked now in our and in two hours and three hours in four hours and you know, you're using science from personal experience.

Speaker 3:          02:00:32       Absolutely not just a. I had to go back and take human sexuality classes so that I can feel comfortable saying the f word on your show. Really. Absolutely you to take. I took it years ago. It helped me with dealing with my own upbringing and my conservative conservative. When you grew up in a time with no internet man, the world's changed. Absolutely. working it out. Doctors dot dropping, f bombs left and right. And these days, oh you got a fucking broken leg kit and being from New York, you know, fuck is the what? And his first and idea is second and fuck his third. yeah, it's a common one. It's a common one, but there are better words in some of us. there are better words.

Speaker 2:          02:01:15       Again, this people have this response to the testosterone. They developed this anxiety issue, panic attack, panic attack, but what exactly is a panic attack like what's going on when you,

Speaker 3:          02:01:27       it's an explosive fear of the unknown where they think something bad's going to happen to them and they get hyperventilation and they get a fast pulse and from the hyperventilation they can actually pass out because they changed the ph of the blood. We had a guy in the ufc that was in the, um, in the locker room about the fight, had a panic attack and was hyperventilating and they actually pulled them from the fight, haven't breathed it into a brown paper bag or a plastic bag or put one of those black hoods over their head. Well, what does that do? What the lag. What it is is, uh, when you hyperventilate, you're blowing in, you're getting in too much oxygen and getting rid of your calcium and it falls out of solutions in calcium's, responsible for a neuro conductivity. So when you breathe in too much or giving you a hyper ventilate, you create a change in the acid balance, acid base and calcium is used to try and stabilize it.

Speaker 3:          02:02:20       So what happens is it falls out of solution. Calcium hydroxide. What does the black bag do? A, I was just being funny. Brown paper bag. I like plastic over brown paper. Brown paper makes too much crunching. Noise, cocaine. So the idea of a bag being that you're not getting all the oxygen from around where you're breathing in carbon dioxide, you need to bring back your blowing from hyperventilation. You blow out a lot of carbon dioxide which your body actually needs. You know, if you give someone pure oxygen, you can stop their breathing because the balance of breathing is between oxygen and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is actually what stimulates you to breathe. What about those like oxygen bars, places? What's the actor's name who has such with age? A woody harrelson I think has a lot of the action bars. Yeah, they're great. Uh, you know, Michael Jackson used to sleep in a hyperbaric chamber.

Speaker 3:          02:03:15       He did, and that has higher oxygen concentration, so getting more oxygen, you know, in las vegas, you go to the airport, I was just there and they have all these oxygen bars there. So after you had been bombed out for three days, playing every night until two in the morning, we're never getting to bed. Oxygen can help you, uh, with some improvement in improving your focus. But don't they pump it into the casinos as well? Yes. The supposedly is what they said. I don't know what the true keeps you up. That's what I've heard too, but I don't know if that's true. We need to find. I don't know if they would ever fucking admit that you bring an oxygen meter in and if it's a 21 percent or higher, you know they are because it's, I think 19 percent in the natural world. The fucking tackle. You want them to oxygen. That's why they have all those cards tackle them. That's why they have the cameras up there to make sure you don't bring oxygen meters and the frisky for oxygen meter walk through the door. And the idea that the oxygen keeps you awake, is that what it is? Correct. WhaT he says is false. Snopes says it's false. how the fuck do they know?

Speaker 3:          02:04:20       It's just the gambling. Gambling is. Could you ask him, is it true that when you ask for a drink, when you're playing craps, they put a lot of alcohol in it, so it disinhibition so that you put more money down then you have. Well they definitely give you good free drinks when you're gambling. that was good.

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       That is a crazy fucking thing that they're allowed to do. Give you free drugs That lower your inhibitions and cause you to make irresponsible decisions while you're doing something that involves gambling and fucking crazy. But so they got oxygen there. I supported him 100 percent with it. I've done those. Um, those oxygen bars. I did one in vegas once we sat down and tried it and my friend eddie and I was like, you're feeling anything. He's like, did you get to sit in their flavored? Probably was going up my nose or sucking on it. I don't even remember. But I remember like given up after awhile, it's like, this isn't new, this is not enough. It's not like you have a shot and you're like, woo, like this is working. Maybe you awake. that was the problem. You had to be asleep to do it.

Speaker 2:          02:05:22       Oh. So if you're asleep and you have little oxygenic does better. The guy at the float lab, he pumps a oxygen into the isolation tanks. He uh, has an oxygen scrubber, like one of those ones that make those weird noises and you know, those auctions, scrubber things, it pumps air into the isolation tank to enhance it. Doing that tomorrow for the first time. Where, which, which place? Venice float lab. Yeah. it's awesome. I love it. Yeah. So I wrote lab a life changing word. I going to have some flashbacks or something. You mighT. how long are you in the tank? Depends. You could do it for as little as an hour. Miki. I've done it for a half an hour. If I just want to relax, I have something to do and I'm just trying to unwind. I got three kids, so I'm thinking three hours signal deprivation it. Two hours is good. It helps. I do it every time.

Speaker 4:          02:06:11       Come down. Yeah. Yeah. What, uh, what helps about it? Um, you think in a clear fashion like things are coming to you and I believe, you know, it's just, you, you're able to kind of work through it a little bit better where there's no distractions. The distractions, there's not. Yeah, you don't got other stuff going on. And, and I, I work better internalizing things like that. Like Was talking about the counseling for me, that's just my personality would never work because uh, the person I'm talking to doesn't know what I went through, but in my own mind when my own dialogue is talking to me back because I, the last time I was talking to, I remember talking to myself and I was talking back to me it was, yeah, it was very, it was very strange. But that's what was happening was I was bringing up things and I was talking and I was responding in fashion with what I was talking about, like calming myself down. And it just worked better

Speaker 2:          02:07:08       the way I describe it as a, the first 20 minutes or so, me and the tank is sort of like a seminar on my own life. So giving myself advice because the mine untethered from the body's very difficult to get to that state unless you're doing some really fucking heavy meditation for long periods of time. It's very difficult to achieve this kind of state. You get in an isolation tank after half an hour just floating. It takes me a while to get there. Yeah. You got to compensate. I don't know. I don't. I mean I don't do it often. Yeah, that's a big of it too. It takes me a while, but once I'm there it yeah, it does help. I do leave clear and it is something that I think is a benefit, especially for things like ptsd and mental issue. You know, if you had one near you and you could do it on a regular basis, I think it would help even more because it's part of it is relaxing with the experience itself.

Speaker 2:          02:07:55       The experience to me, because I have one of my basement, it's a very natural part of life. I go in there all the time, so it's a natural thing. It's not like, oh, what are we doing here? It's like, here We go again. You know, it's normal. It's almost over, buddy. The other thing too was for me with my body, just wIth paint, you know, I'm used to walking around at a certain comfort level of just the way my body works. Some laying down in there when my body's not supporting itself, I was able to let that go. I let that go and just kind of focused like I said on my mind and that's a huge thing for me. Like I. It wasn't until I did that the first time that I realized how much my body is impacting my mind, you know, really just because you get used to feeling a certain way the whole time, especially with like pain or my leg or my knees.

Speaker 2:          02:08:41       You take that out of the equation, oh, you know, your mind's like, okay, this let's we can focus on something else and that it is nice and besides the alleviation of pressure, because you're not carrying your weight anymore, there's also absent salts in it, which is an excellent source of magnesium, which also relaxes the muscle. So you got like sort of a dual effect going on. You have this no gravity effect because you're completely floating, you're bobbing in this water and then you also have this magnesium when, and this, one of the things that people always recommend for muscle soreness is epson salts and this delivery method of getting the magnesium through your skin that way supposed to be excellent as well. It's the biggest organ in the body. So it absorbs a lot. What do we need to do to help more people out here with this?

Speaker 2:          02:09:25       To spread the word out about this, about what you are doing. And matthew, thank you very much for doing this and coming on here. And uh, and jason, this is, this is a very important issue. And, uh, I think all the things that we've discussed here today, the, the, the benefits I think could really greatly help a lot of people. So how do we, uh, how do we spread this? Well, as we found out in january, you had an impressive response curve for the program that we did. We talked about, you know, big foot and we talked about narrows and we talked about,

Speaker 3:          02:10:04       yeah, the injection, you know, everything we've talked about and then lead up to this area of tbi. I think finding A multitude of avenues. That's why I've been dragging matthew with me to some of the guys that I know around the states that have shows not similar to yours but not as grand and have each helped to make a little dent. And we just need someone to come up and champion a. I'm going to get in touch with howard schultz, who's the ceo of starbucks who, uh, yesterday I had this really great statement he made that we need to honor our vets by giving them a concert and a job now in order for them to go to that concert. And I appreciate and enjoy it and have that job. We have to fix the underlying problem not to mask it and therefore letting vets know that there is an option and next year, uh, april of finished my book by january and then put on a class which will be limited to a hundred docs to come in to be trained in this process, these protocols which are relatively simple, um, and then go out and start being representative of an alternative to antidepressants, antianxiety meds,

Speaker 6:          02:11:25       bit of an uphill battle that has to be fought also with the idea of supplementing hormones to achieve a balance in the body. Because a lot of people, when they think of soldiers, what do they think of? They think of these testosterone fueled savage men. And then, you know, you add testosterone to that boy, you know, like you're just gonna make more aggressive, crazier.

Speaker 3:          02:11:49       It doesn't work that way. The reason what is up yet, it's uphill battle. If they weren't in the military, they go into a clinic. Now what's happening is you might have low testosterone syndrome, let's check you. And they do two tests. And I find that they're low testosterone, but they don't know the cause for it because they didn't do an extensive enough to say that it's due to head trauma, you know, whichever way they can do it, to get guys onto a ask the history of trauma, do the lab tests and get them on it, but the resistance is because of the controversy that has always stood there with testosterone and with the balco and the barry bonds and all these things relative to public guide that negative. They demonized growth hormone, they demonized testosterone instead of talking about the benefits of it and how it could be utilized in this specific situation and it works. So anyone who's listening, you know, I know someone who might be there to connect us with the right people in government and so forth to go and do it. That is the issue.

Speaker 6:          02:12:48       Knee jerk reaction, right? Immediately people want to think of it as like, this is a. This is a cheating thing. This is a bad thing, right? Just like the salt thing that we were talking,

Speaker 3:          02:12:57       we'll stop everybody's estrogen replacement stopped everybody's insulin replacement or thyroid replacement. Our body had it from when we were born, so why do we assume that it's not necessary? I mean, I've had a number of women who came in who were significantly testosterone deficient with the all the symptoms that a woman get from testosterone deficiency. they're not nice to be around and their doctor says, well, you don't need it. You just need your estrogen replaced and they don't even replace the progesterone and you need to have that balance so they don't get sleep deprivation. Developed depression, panic attack, and ended up in the emergency room every two weeks

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       like we see.

Speaker 7:          02:13:34       My thing too is that I think, I don't think this is a cure for everybody. Every single person is going to fall into this category. You went to war, you know, you suffered some through some stuff and now here's your cure. I don't think that's what it is, but I think that there's a. There's a two stages here. There's the stage where, you know, like math, you talked about where he admitted he didn't feel okay and he was willing to go seek some help for it, you know, and hopefully this movie you're watching chris, who's a guy who was tough as nails, he was the baddest, baddest, you know, seal there ever was. He found a way to admit that he didn't feel okay and went and sought some help for it. Then then in seeking help, there needs to be more pragmatic solutions. Like right now we're looking at the thing and it's like, it's a grab bag, you know, and to me this feels like a, a mind body solution.

Speaker 7:          02:14:27       This isn't, this isn't freudian counseling, this isn't some lady sitting there, you know, god bless these women who work at the va in the men too. Who are these counselors? Did they go through hell? I mean, imagine sitting there every day. They're on the clock, they're seeing guys on their lunch breaks. They're seeing people After work. They have huge hearts, but they can't handle it, you know, and after awhile you shut down, you hear this story over and over again, you see the misery and it's just like, it just sucks the life out of them, you know, and, and so I don't think that's the solution for everybody. I think that there's, you know, there's a, there's a number of things that are going to help people, but If this, if seeking blood work and seeking a mind body solution through medicine is available and, and is out there in the public and is getting vetted through other doctors and, and spread among the medical community than these guys have a chance. But if it's not, if it's just one thing, one doctor sit in here and uh, you know, some guy in Missouri is not gonna make it out to see Dr. Gordon.

Speaker 2:          02:15:28       I think it's really important that you said what you said about the it's not the solution for everybody and it's only one part of it that what we said before, thIs is a holistic approach, but if you don't heal the body, it's going to be incredibly difficult to put the mind at peace and it's healing. The body's not necessarily going to put the mind at peace, but it's a step in the right direction where there's. I mean it's you have nothing to lose. You do it and you try and if that's not really what's going on, then you take the next step, but you don't know if you don't look. Yeah, you don't know. You don't know. And matthew came down, we took a look and it's a simple blood test. Simple blood work. Okay, so for the guy out there or the gal with ptsd, with depression that's dealing with the things that they have some sort of traumatic brain injuries in their past, it could be contributing to this. What's their step? What do they do? Well, they can go to the website which is tbi, medlegal.com. Tbi, medlegal, tbi, med

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       legal.com and put in an application and those that are coming through and it asks military and asked the type of injury you had and what medications you're on and the military get put into a separate grouping and we're waiting for funding to come in. Uh, so that we can start takIng more of the people. and this is the laboratory testing has always been a 100 percent covered. The treatment wasn't met, paid for some of them, but I help him in his, uh, in all their situation and we're hoping to get someone who will champion with some money. I had one patient offer a significant amount and that'll help to cover about 100 patients. So it'll cover everything for a year and cost for treatment. I meAn the blended to start from that we developed about 10 years ago is $100 for six months supply.

Speaker 6:          02:17:19       Well, let's talk about doing something through this show and let's talk about promoting something like maybe through a kickstarter or go fund me or something like that at all. Contribute to it and we'll try to get other people to contribute to it and let's just try to get something where there's at least

Speaker 4:          02:17:33       a point of. Have a starting point for a lot of people. It'd be great. Let's do that on my end. One thing you can, anyone can reach out to me on twitter. Matthew gosney to black dicks coming your way soon. Those send it off to going to be awful. Just I'll send it right back. What is it again? Matthew gazani too.
