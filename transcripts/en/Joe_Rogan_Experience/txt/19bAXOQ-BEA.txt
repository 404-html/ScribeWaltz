Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Don't right. Yeah, and we're alive. You got to put dive, put that thing down. I want you to focus. I want you to fuck cause I gotta get into your head band. I got to find out what you're about. Your instagrams just at Joe Rogan, right? Yes. Okay. Did you post it

Speaker 2:          00:00:17       posted?

Speaker 1:          00:00:19       Go, go. Okay. Turn that oversee. Can't look at it as the key sign that I wouldn't think that a guy like you'll be easily distracted. You can't be. I'm like, I'm just like on different things. If I get on something I'm on it and then it's like something else and my brain is doing so many different things that at one time, how did you get to be the guy that makes people shit their pants when they watch your videos? Because if you haven't seen any of his videos, stop, pause podcasts for perspective. Go look up James Kingston. What is your youtube? I just put James Kingston, James Kingston will pop up and all forms of social media, right? You got Instagram, all that jazz, and there's just ridiculous photos and videos of you doing shit that people watch with their friends and everybody goes, John Chase of Christ and they cringe.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       And your asshole puckers out like this one. Where are you out here? Uh, climbing in the Ukraine with Mustang wanted. Is that the guy's name yet? So as you, you hooked up with the Russians, you out rushing to Russians? Yeah, I didn't, I wouldn't say out rushing to them, but, but that's what they do, right? That's the whole thing. And he said, I think only Russians can out Russian Russians. So he's climbing. First of all, how hard is it to get to this tower? We're looking at this video and I am fucking freaking out. How high are you up here? This one, I think it was like just over 200 meters.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       This is my staying. Oh my God. He's hanging by one hand. This one is the second tallest building in new crane. Right? Oh my God. How do you go in the bottom and it's like a shopping center. And then they took me like through all these little doors and then we took a lift down into like the basement and then we walked through the basement and fight another lift. And Oh my God, he's standing on the edge here. Who standing yet? You must thing again. Oh my keys out of his fucking mind. Holy Fuck. This video is hard to watch, man.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       So in these mosques and what your hair, what, what led you to this and how long have you been doing this? So I've done Porco for nine years. You know what Parkour is? Sure. Jumping around, all that fun stuff. That classes for little kids now they do. Kids have pretty cool. Yeah. Break their arms at about four years ago, I got to a point where I was like satisfied with what I was able to do. Right. But I was still like super scared of heights, so I was like, okay, I know that if I want to get over this fear of fights, I need to do it face my fear. So is this your stuff? Yeah. So this is you running on trees and stuff and the whole idea behind [inaudible] is to use the world around you. Steps and fences and all kinds of crazy shit and uh, you know, you're essentially performing acrobatics with all this stuff. Yeah, just jumping around. Yeah. I think the now how do you do this and not get hurt? He's just practice a lot. Like the whole idea isn't to go out and just do crazy stuff and, and risk your life.

Speaker 1:          00:03:16       You start slow, you start with small jumps and then you progress steadily and sensibly. And then eventually you'll get to a point where you can do things that make most people feel a bit sick. Well, what did you start doing? Did you take gymnastics and snowed or something? I was like a little fat kid when I was younger. Not Super Fat, but unhealthy. Just played computer games. That was it. How were you able to jump so far too? That's another thing that freaks me out. There's growing legs. You know what? I'm six foot three. I can jump. I know, but there's a lot of people that are six foot three. They can't jump from one building to a next. Like I've seen some of the ridiculous ones where you jump from the top of a building to another building, like on a very small ledge that you landing on.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       Yeah. This practice, you start with like the fuck do you practice that? You stopped with the jumping. That's like four foot wide. Right. And then as you get, but you do that hundreds and hundreds of times until that becomes like nothing. Right. And then you'll realize that you can now jump five feet and then blah blah blah blah blah. And I, my peaks like 1111 and a half foot standing jump and a half foot. Yeah. Wow. Duty should be in the Olympics. They are on another level. How far can like a long jumper jump? Eight feet, 20 feet, something like that. I think the record's probably 2122 with the whole shit, but still 11 feet in between buildings. Now when you're jumping in one buildings taller, another building smaller, it gives you more time to, to travel, right? Yeah. So like, like when you're jumping, I saw this one video of you were on, you were on the ledge and you leapt across from one building to another and I'm like, this has gotta be Photoshop.

Speaker 1:          00:04:52       This can't even be real. The one that you post are, yeah. Yeah. That one's in Cambridge. That one's actually a small jump because it's quite big height difference. Massive impact because of the height. Yeah. And you've got alleged that's maybe like a foot deep to land on and then there's a scaffolding pole right in front of it, dude, that you kind of slam into. You can see it in the video. I slam into that pole, Jesus. But that, that's all part of taking the impact to you use your arms as well. Yeah. But that's, it doesn't seem like something could practice a lot. Right. Slamming into something that hard. Those ones you can't practice a lot, but no. Yeah, you figure it out. You figure out how to take impact and yeah. So you started doing this about four years ago, right? You started doing the height stuff, started doing the climbing kind of scary stuff. And when did you start releasing videos right away? Um, no I don't really, I mean I'd, I'd released one though. This one. Oh this one makes me shit my pants. This is it. That seems so far. That seems so far. How far it's not that fun. Like you could jump to the lower bit there quite easily. That's what other people have done right. Into a pole arc.

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       Yeah. That is bananas, Dude. Yeah. So how many, how, how much is the distance between those two buildings? Between those? Probably like 10 foot, 12 foot maybe. It does not seem like it, but didn't do it. Cause it's because there's a big drop as well. It's more about judging it correctly and not jumping too far and not jumping too little. Right? Yeah, I see it like 12 foot, I think. Run that one more time Jeremy. I just want to see this one more time cause this freaks me out every time I see it. Every time I see it I'm like, he's gonna die for sure. There's no way you can make it. So you kind of like lean forward and then swing your arms and then push off of it. So you're, you're like a standard. Yeah. Jump cause you're already committing to the jump as you like.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       Yeah. You could see it in your momentum like your head, cause you have a Gopro on his above. It's past the center line of like that, that beam that you're standing on and you're going out there, what's it called? And that's it. Oh that's the idea. Like you train, you train enough so that when you're stood on the edge looking at something like you have no doubt, you can't afford to have any doubt. If I doubted myself there and I commit to it and Eileen and then I back out, I'm dead. I had him go crazy dream last night man. That I'm just remembering. Yeah. I had a crazy dream that I was climbing with Alex honnold. Yeah, no Alex. Alex has been on the podcast before and uh, every now and then I'll think about how crazy he is about how crazy what he does is, but how like mellow and she is about it, you know, like, you know when he's describing climbing, he's like, it's really actually kind of mellow.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       It's like if anything is like, if you're really scared, so he's gone horribly wrong and it's really, really bad. It's exactly the same. Yeah. People think I'm like, hello and Adrenalin jumping. Yeah. Yeah. It says he fell, but unless you just fine. She pulls it out right there then. There it is, dude. Fuck all that. Is this Alex? That's not hidden. Don't think so. No. It looks like, Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm not into that. Crazy. That's too much trust in the backpack. Everything I do is like interesting that, yeah, not into that. My friend Andy, Andy Stump, he does that wingsuit shit. He's got with a world record and wingsuit flying. Yeah. He's out of his fucking mind. He just loves to do that. He gets to the top cliffs of the world and just throws his fucking body Hoff. And it has like a squirrel suit, like the close proximity stuff where like we watched one the other day where a guy slammed into a bridge. Yeah. He missed in it. Yeah. I've seen that. Yeah. The sound as Rod. I don't know why. Rough and expect it to be so loud.

Speaker 2:          00:08:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       The meat and those people on the bridge. Oh yeah. And his family were there. Oh yeah. That's not good. That's not good. Yeah. Um, do you worry about that when you're doing these crazy jumps? I don't know. So I mean it's, it's in my mind like if I make a mistake, that's it, but I don't make mistakes. That's, that's what you got to be confident and you've got to have confidence in what you're doing. Otherwise. Like if you're, if you're up there and you're scared, right. The chances of failing are so much higher, I think. Yeah. I think with anything, I mean, you have to be in the moment, right. Well prepared in the moment. Yeah. Um, how much of what you're doing or is it really you taking a chance and how much of it is just you having a better understanding of what your body is capable of and the average person than most people I should say, not taking chances.

Speaker 1:          00:09:24       Maybe like 10%. Wow. That's interesting. And that's, that's only on me taking shots and trusting structures. Like maybe jumping to something that I, I'm not able to check first. Right. But it doesn't happen often. Every time I do it I'm like probably shouldn't have done that. It's really interesting. Also the, that you picking this up four years ago is sort of like we are social media. It's around the time where social media really started to take off. Yeah. Maybe a couple of years before that it did, but like youtube videos of people doing crazy shit really between like six and seven years ago. That's when it really, is that right? Am I saying that right? Yeah. Yeah. Like 2000 tennis is a really started to take off. Yeah. So you kind of caught, you caught that wave and I didn't, you know, I didn't really get anywhere any kind of good, decent like following on youtube until three, four years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       That was it. I released my first like crane climb video that that blew up and went super viral and that was, that kicked everything off. And then because of that video and now the a TV show in the, in the UK on channel full and then that was everything just took off then. Wow. Now these Russian cats that you were hanging out with in the Ukraine and we climbed up on that tower, there's a lot of those guys. Like you seen a lot of videos? Yeah. Like what is it about Russians and climbing on the, what is it about these crazy kids and why they're so nutty? I don't know. That's something I've been trying to figure out. Like I've, I've only been to Ukraine, I haven't been to Russia, but there's not much, like there's not much going on there, you know, there's not much to live for in Russia or Ukraine.

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       I don't want to sound mean, but I know what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. And that's so much cut. Uh, they're just familiar with death and violence and stuff like that. Like Mustang, he goes out, I don't know, every week. And it goes like organized fights, just like street fights and just beats the hell out of brandon people. But that to me is like, so he does those English boy, those organized treat fights where they like five guys take on five guys, big groups. I've seen those. Yeah, he's, he does that. And I was like, what? So he just does everything crazy. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Whoa. And he just, does it offer the thrill? Yeah, I think so. Damn. What a weird way to live. I know it's weird way to have your brain wired. It was such an interesting kind of insight when I was there to people like that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       So how do you make contact with these guys? Do you speak or Ukraine or whatever? The speaker. They're Russian. What are they both usually, what does it, both Ukrainian. Russian? Yeah. So it was organized for me to go meet him for the TV show I did in the UK. And that was a part of that show was me going to Ukraine to meet somebody else that did similar things. And that was where I met him. So they somehow or another got in contact with him through his youtube videos or something along those lines. Wow. In a strange world we live in now, you know? Yeah. You can go to that place and risk your life with a bunch of other crazy people. Yes. No, that's cool, I guess. Yeah. Now what has it been like for you to become famous for being like this crazy risk taker?

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       Um, I wouldn't say I'm like super famous. Already famous. I know who you are. I told my friends, they're like, oh, that too. It's crazy. How many millions of hits to your videos have fucking millions. Bunch of million. That's famous man. That's what's called famous. Right. Unless it's one dude is watching it over and over again. That's just my mum, my boy, he's alive. Oh, that's cool. I Dunno. That's a bit weird. Yeah. You'll famous. Yeah, I guess it's the same as that, but on a much smaller scale. Yeah, but you're famous for doing like risk take. I'm just framing payments for talking shit. Yeah. It's easy to talk shit. You just have to say funny things or be ridiculous. But you're famous for like literally doing something that makes people shit their pants when they look at a video of it. I look at videos of the stuff you do, and I started Jamie, I'll tell ya, I started squeezing.

Speaker 1:          00:13:29       I'm like, fuck. And I go, oh, what the fuck is he doing? I don't, you know, I don't have any desire to do what you're doing. That's why my dream about Alex, about climbing with Alex, like here's one. Yeah, this is the first one. So this was the first big one I ever released. This video literally changed my life. This is what we announced two, 2016 it's three years climbing over some water. It was this the first time you had done something like this? No. So I'd done a couple other ones, but this was the biggest and this was like the first big one that I'd hung off. God Damn Dude. No, you, you're in it. It's funny cause I live like just next to that, which is really cool. Oh Wow. Dude, if you fell that would not be good. Not even into water. It's just the water.

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       He'd survived. Oops. Oh you fuck, you're out of your fucking mind man. Well you dealing dude. What were you thinking right now when you're hanging above that water? First of all your hand sweaty. Not Hands. My hands. Never already. My hands sweat when I'm not doing anything, but what? I'm doing this stuff quite, it's like who's stopping you right now? Send my friend Simon is up there with me and another friend Doug was there too. What do you think Simon and Doug would do if you fell? Well, they just hurry up real down and oh Jesus, you go in one handed mother fucker dude. Like what are you thinking? Why you're doing this? You know what? Just like Alec Arnold said, there's not much going on. It's just me in that moment. But there is, you get a first time to eat breakfast, right? Yeah. But thinking about what you're going to eat for breakfast, you know, most of the time when you get to a situation where you're about to do something that you've never done before and you kind of naturally, your brain kind of hyped it up and makes it seem a lot worse than what it actually is.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       And then you do it and you're like, why the fuck was I scared of that? That was exactly the same. So it's like just scared of that because if you fell you're fucking dead. Yeah. I mean that's not rocket science. That's a thick pole you're hanging on to. I sound like a small poles, like super easy. Can you do a one arm chin up? No, I'm not. I'm not like particular stone fatigue at all. Please work on that. You should be able to do it when I'm channel. But if your like what? Active limbs, man, it's not, it's not easy to do one. I'm Chins when you have this big, but there's gotta be some crossfit guys that can do it. Yeah. I feel like strength isn't in my jeans. No. Started out of it. And that you were hanging from your fucking, how long did you hang for a, I saw him three times.

Speaker 1:          00:15:46       Probably like 30 seconds each time. It's hard to hang 30 seconds. 30 seconds is tough. It's not when you like, when you do that all the time we'll stuff is swinging around and all that stuff. It's quite easy. But most people overestimate the amount of time that they can hang. Yeah. I uh, we had this thing on fear factor where people had to hold onto a bar that hangover like a river and a girls beat the guys. Really? Yeah. Interesting. Because girls don't weigh as much thing. Yeah. So the girls would be like 110 pounds and they'd be able to hang on for a couple of minutes. Where's the guys at? About a minute and a half. There were all tromping off. Yeah. Yeah. I weighed 200 pounds. That's a lot of weight to carry around in your hands. Flat at the moment so that I don't know how you could possibly allow yourself to get fat when you're not jumping across every, I think every ounce is important.

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       Yeah. Like backpackers lose weight so they don't, they don't have as much body weight around. I need to lose it. I need to sort my life out and start your life. You're doing crazy shit. So you, um, this is like what you do professionally now, right? How does that work? I'm like, what is a normal, a normal day. Yeah. Did you go out, jump up and say, you know, the normal day I do a lot of work behind the scenes. Just like editing and emails and just like boring stuff that people don't see this trait of duties. Exactly. Yeah. It has to be done, but it just works the same as any other online influence. They're like, you got a big following, opportunities come your way. And if you do something like that, that's a bit different and a bit, I guess crazy to most people.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       Even cooler opportunities come in when it that's, that's it, right? You got Youtube money, you've got like merchandise on my website. You've got sponsored videos and sponsors. That's it. Really. So you work directly with sponsors. You have like an agent or a manager. That's hilarious. It's kid. You're going places. Yeah, I smoking a big cigar. Listen, we're gonna have to take it to next level. Can you walk into your hands? Can you walk in your hands on top of the Russians? The Russians are walking on their hands. I can't beat the Russians, man. You can't go too crazy. How many of them die a lot? I think there's, there's a few videos floating around of people falling off cranes and shit, but it's super like, oh, that's not nice to look at it. Yeah. Have you seen those videos? I haven't seen any of these.

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       I want to see him. Well, the wingsuit guy flying to the bridge the other day, I thought I didn't want to see it, but then I watched it six times in a row and blacks out before he hits, right? Oh No. Have you found that? Oh yes. Oh, you see him bounce off the bridge and it sounds like a car accident. It's a bang sound like the bang. But it sounds like a car accident. Yeah, it's fucked up. It's the screams afterwards that get me. Yeah, it's all bad. Yeah. All of it's bad that people going, oh, bone line. But that is half of the reason why these people were watching is the possibility that that could happen. Even though they don't want it to happen. That accentuates thrill. It's a strange thing, isn't it? Because I hate watching and stuff like that, but there's something in me that's like, I can't not click it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       How could you say you hate watching stuff like that? Because you do dare devil videos. I mean, I hate watching people die. Yes. Oh, I understand that. But do you like watching people live? Do you like watching people take risks and live or do you go, oh Jesus, I don't, I don't really watch that much stuff. So you just do it. I just do stuff. Yeah. Interesting. So do you look at like the competitors? Like is there like a, a bunch of you that are like pushing the boundaries and you're like, Huh, Nah, I literally have no interest in beating other people or making something better or more dangerous than other people. I have no interest in that. I'm doing it because I love it and I love making videos and you just see those guys that were walking on their hands and they were doing flips and then they were doing hoverboards on the edge of this building.

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       Yeah. That when I have a real problem as rough because I've been on hover boards before and sometimes you fall off, sometimes they fuck up, sometimes they stop working, sometimes she goes wrong, like you're trusting and some cheaply made Chinese hunk of Shit. Jesus. Oh you fucks, I can't. Oh he's spinning around in circles. Spinning bothers me so much. And he's like literally like getting to the edge and spinning around. I mean inches from fucking certain death and moving quite quickly by the way. I mean, I don't think it's that bad. Like shut the fuck up. Of course it's, I've been in one of those and it's quite easy. Shut it off, Jamie. He's got his hands, his hands, dude, he's standing on his hands on a fucking hoverboard on a building on the top of the world. Fuck you. He's crazy. These people are crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       Look, my hands are Russian. Russian. Yeah, they're different folk, right? Yeah. Yeah. They're their own species. There are definitely wild folk. It's just the ability to do that, and then, and this new thing that we have now, we can take videos of it and just upload it instantly. You don't have to have any sort of a network or anything that approves it. You put up your own thing and then boom, all of a sudden you're like, yeah, you're a one man show. That's like the most amazing thing about youtube is it's like everybody has a job on youtube. Anybody can go on Youtube, upload stuff, get paid for it. Right. That's just, it's just so cool. And then if you make good stuff that's inspiring people or people enjoy [inaudible]. Yeah, it's crazy. So cool. It's very strange, right? It's a completely new world that I don't think that anybody anticipated that they were going to have individual content providers.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       We're essentially going to be like their own network. Yeah. Now how, what kind of an obligation do you have to the people that are, that are watching your show? Like how often do you post stuff? Um, I have no like set schedule. I probably should, I feel like I grow a lot more if I had set that. Like the more I upload, the more I grow and that's just how it works. But like how often can you do that? Common ground climb stuff every day, you know, it's not that. Right. So how, how many days a week a good month in terms of like video uploads would be like three, three or four videos. One I was like good for me. That's interesting. Yeah, because some people try to up hit, I'm trying to do better but, but it's hard though, right? It's just given the nature of what you do.

Speaker 1:          00:22:01       And I live in the UK most of the time. And the, the weather there is just like, yeah, you can't be hanging when it's raining out and it's always, oh fuck that. Oh, you get up there and just do, but your friends are there with the camera. You're like, let's, what was, tell what off, tell it off. I've had a few Jewy situations. Oh fuck. Climate. It's normal. And then when you get to the top, that's what it was like, fuck. Where did this witness come from? Oh my God. Why don't you put that sticky shit on your hands? Like football players use football, American football. Sticky Shit. Like chalk or, no, it was like for cars like glue, they spray glue in their hand, stick them, stick on his own. What's called, yeah, yeah. Spray some shit in your hands. Make some sticky. I'm like, hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       Thinking to taking it to the next level with the sticky. Imagine if you're like hanging in, you just kind of get off. Stripper's use it to allegedly, um, some stuff that you could buy that uh, you would, uh, put on. I think they spray on their legs so they could cling onto bars better and their hololens. Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense. They also helps not getting like calluses and stuff. Ah, that makes sense. No, that doesn't make sense. Because you think like it would you want it to be lubricated then? I mean like, um, when they start to like get sore blister, if I use chalk, I don't get that because they either rip shock. Oh yeah. I use chalk. I use truck for weightlifting and stuff like that. I sweat a lot though. I'm really sweaty hands for whatever reason. I'm just a sweaty fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:23:27       So when I watch your videos, I start sweating, man. I started freaking out to change your clothes. Yeah. Like when I used to play pool, I've always found it really hard to use a pool cue that doesn't have a wrap on it, you know what I mean? And like if it's just a, um, a piece of wood that had like a Polish or a, um, a finish on it. So what I would do is I would get that stripper stuff and I'd put it on my hands. And then that way it allows you to like gently hold onto the pool cue. That sounds so dorky. But uh, this stuff unfortunately though gets on your hands and then you could transfer it to the balls and it makes the ball stick to each other. It's not good. Not Good. So that's my knowledge of a stripper.

Speaker 1:          00:24:03       Gooky stuff that you can have it on with whatever it is, but it's not stick them though. It's probably something similar, but there's also a product that I've used called dry hands that it's like any per sprint for your hands. Yeah. Yeah. I found out about this cause I tried to choke. You seen that stuff? No, it's that, it's just like, it comes out like a Suntan lotion. Ah. And then it just rubs in and kind of dries out and make some pretty sticky. Ooh, I haven't heard of that. Liquid Chalk. I bet. At the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, essentially somehow or another they've figured out a way to stop you from sweating if they spray some stuff on you. Like, well, that's what antiperspirant is. That's a big thing that people like. Right. And they like to not sweat and their underarms.

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       Disgusting. Yeah. Fuck man, this, I, I really have a hard time just watching these videos. I can't imagine if this is like the world that you've, you know, I mean this is the path you've chosen. Your on your, you know, you're in one of the top guys in this madness, I guess. Yeah. You are not for me to say no, but I'm, I don't mean in terms of ranking, I'm just saying that it's, it's a crazy path to take with your life. What digital. Yeah. Yeah. It's unusual. Um, but I've never been kind of, I've never fit into like just the normal world. I hated school. I ended up quitting school, like fairly early. No qualifications, nothing. And how old were you when you quit school? Uh, I can't remember the ages, but it was like, what's, what do you have hit you up high school and then you have college.

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       College? Yeah. Um, so high school I quit like two years before the end. I think I was like 13, 14. Wow. You'll like done. So done. Really. Did your parents get mad? Yeah. He's like, don't worry mom. I I climbed trees and shit. Yeah. I put my mom through a lot of shit when I was a kid. I will do you now 26. So you started off this stuff really early. So at 22 you're out there filming these fucking crazy adventures. Yeah. What'd your parents think then? Well, when I started like I started a little bit of filming, just the park or stuff. Maybe in like 2001, it won't be in now what I was 17, 18 was what I think I first I first made a video and it was me just jumping between railings and, and like small stuff, you know, safe stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:26:17       Moms like, Oh that's nice. And now I remember what I felt shut out, that she was just like not the fuck. I think she hit me by the back of the head. How old were you when you showed her the video of you hanging from the crane? What? I released it three is it goes right away. Like when you look, check this out mom. I never show her. She doesn't really know about things until I, until the, the video is done and it's uploaded. That's a good, yeah. So what did she say to you when she saw that besides hitting, you did have to sit down was he never hits me. It's usually just like, I think she was just freaked out and blown away. Yeah. But I don't know. I can't remember. It wasn't like encouraging words. It was like, what are you doing right while you're doing this and do you remember what you said? Not really. I, I usually just say the same thing. I enjoy it. Just enjoy it. That's it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:08       Now was there any legal repercussions to doing something like that? Have any, has anybody ever gotten mad at you? Uh, yeah. In the UK, there's not really, because it's trespass. Right? And there's no like criminal damage or anything. And Trespass in the UK isn't a criminal offense. It's a civil offense. So I can only get in trouble for it if the owner of the property for some reason wants to take me to court, I sweating like a pig over here thinking of you hanging from that bar over that water. I'm fucking sweating. My hands are sweating, my feet are sweating.

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       I'm sorry I interrupted you. But so it's just a civil offense. Yeah. And Uk, it's just a civil offense. And if they catch you, what does that mean? Like you have to pay a fine or something. Uh, the people that catch me, it's usually just the police. Somebody sees me, calls the police, the police come and they say, what you doing? Try to kind of tell me off and then sent me on my way. Cause there's, there's nothing they can do, which is, which is good for me. What is this? Jamie makes climbing a tower guard. There's a guy up there, right? Yeah. So this, this is the tallest thing I've ever climbed, right. We're in the middle of get up there and there's a dude up there. Yeah. So I went up and then about 10 minutes after I got to the top, the crane starts powering up like, like spinning and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       And I'm like, what the Hell is going on? Like somebody like got a remote for this crane. So I climbed back down from the, it's like it's one of these, right? So there's a little kind of thing here. And then that's the main arm. Okay. So I climbed down from the backside and then he's in his little room doing this crazy stuff. And so you're still climbing even though you know this thing's gonna move all. I spoke to him and he said, hey brother, I had a little conversation and I was like, can I climb this crane? And then I was like, can you, can you just like leave the crane still lock it off for like 10 minutes while I do it, cause I've come all this way. And what'd he say? And he was like, yes. Okay. Wow. What a nice guy. Yeah, I know.

Speaker 1:          00:29:00       And this has been moved down. The bottom does in Dubai. This is in Dubai. At the Marina. Yeah. It was really cool. I love what happened. Now when you're doing this and you're climbing, when you're worried about being arrested, cause if you get arrested in Dubai, that's no joke. Yeah. So they say I don't, I don't know. Dubai. Dubai's a funny one. I felt like they've got, I feel like they've got bigger fish to fry and they're kind of dealing with actual serious stuff. This what, what, what happened when I got down, I had to like sit with all the site managers and everything for a few hours. And the main guy, like the site manager, the main site manager said if they phoned the police, they'll all lose their jobs. Okay. So that's kind of how it works. Oh, okay. So usually they beat the fuck out of you and tell you don't come back.

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       They don't know and never, no, but I mean, I'm joking, but they can't be happy that you're doing this right. And it wasn't, but they also work because it just blew their minds. Oh, I see. Every time it's the same. They're like, you shouldn't be doing this. They tried to tell me off and then when, when, uh, when it comes to me leaving they're like, can we take a picture with you every time you're so high up here man. How, how high are up? Your right, it is 450 meters. What in the fuck is, yeah, I'm just thinking of 450 feets ridiculous. 450 meters. That's, that's insanity one over the water was only 300 feet. So this is like full times,

Speaker 3:          00:30:22       full time.

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       It would take you a long time to hit the ground. Yeah it would. So while you're climbing up here, what is going through your mind? You're just being careful and watching your stuff. This one was like really greasy cause I've been for that for two years. I think the driver's head and it was just coated in like grease and dust the air and fuck. It was like climbing, climbing yet like somebody had just smothered it in moderation. Oh my God. Just while I'm gone slow and I'm getting my feet in the right place. And so the feet part of slippery too. Everything is like butter. Yeah. Christ, James, James, James, James, James. So you get up to the top. Please tell me, don't hang from the top of this too, but it was just too slippery. Yeah. Oh fuck you made a judgment call while you're there.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       Yeah. This is such a mind. Fuck. Good Lord. You're up by the way. How awesome is Dubai credits? I love it. What a crazy. A city that didn't exist just a few decades ago. So cool man. It's one of my favorite places mainly because you can do stuff like this. Where do you do when you get up to the top? Do you just like put, throw your hands up like I'm the king of the world or do you have a jerk off up there? That'd be a feat. It's a light up there in case a fucking plane hits it. It's how high you are. The Oh, trump. It's hard to watch. So, um, how many hours did it take you to do to get up there or how long did it take you? Two hours. But it was like, so the beginning was I got there at like three 30 in the morning and in Dubai they start work at like three 30 or four o'clock because it's cooler and that's just like hundreds and hundreds of these dudes stood outside the, like the entrance to the site.

Speaker 1:          00:32:14       So I'm like, how the hell am I going to get into this place dark when this is all going on? It was pitch black. Yeah. And I managed to find like a little corner that I could sneak in and then sneak over the fence and there's people everywhere and I don't know how I managed to get in without them seeing me. And then as soon as I dropped down, I just dropped to the floor and they crawled across the floor between like these scaffolding bars and stuff like that. And then Tom Cruise mission impossible. I've had some cool situations, man, some really fun stuff. And then I get to the bottom of the crane. So the idea is I get to the crane, I climb up like a bit of the crane and then I get into the building. That's the easiest way. And usually because to climb the crane for 450 meters is just like insane.

Speaker 1:          00:32:56       Especially in that heat is a killer. And I had like just one of these one bottle of wineries. So you are your, um, so it takes you a couple of hours and you're going through the building first. So it took me a while to get up the crane and then in, cause I've got backpack and it's hot and it's like dry and it's hard to breathe and wow. Yeah, it was the wrong time of the year to do it really. And then I get in and then it's just stares and stares and stares. That's crazy. You get here at three 30 and everybody's just showing up for work too. So they work three 30 until like early morning and then they quit. They seem to work nonstop. Those guys, I don't know how they do it. It's not good. And that probably paid like two bucks a day or something. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33:36       There was a whole a vice special on it about, uh, some of the more unscrupulous builders out there. But they do is they go to third world countries. They promise these people a certain amount of money and then they bring them over to the life. Yeah. Then they going to be able to send money home and change their family's lives. So they go there and take these jobs and they take their passports away. Yeah. We give them a fraction of what they were offered and then they live in squalor through, I think I've seen it. They live like out in the middle of nowhere and they will have these shared showers and toilets and toilet. It's like a hole in the ground. It was awful. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean that's a, that's how you get up city built that quick, cheap. Yeah. It's scary is so, uh, but as uh, as a completed entity as a thing, it's pretty impressive.

Speaker 1:          00:34:23       Yeah. Cause his truck, you know, as a city, it's amazing. Yeah. This is one of the coolest cities I've ever been. They're just pushing it, just pushing, you know, they just living it up all the time. Have you seen the new big, um, what's it called? Big, but like the London eye, that building a London eye in Dubai, in the marina, and it's like so much bigger. What does the London eye, you know that, have you been to London? Yes. Big. Oh, the ferris wheel. That's what it's called. The London eye. Yeah. But the building a bigger one, that voting not times, like five or something ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah. I've been on, I've looked at it by that. I haven't been on it. Yeah. The one in Seattle, I want to go there. I want to go that around Christmas when it's cooler and see if I can get 690 foot high Dubai.

Speaker 1:          00:35:12       I will be the low world's largest ferris wheel upon completion in 2015 it says it's not finished, those motherfuckers union. So last time I saw it was just the do need to get more and to kidnap more people. Yeah. Get them to work. Yeah. That's, uh, that's when you get on a ferris wheel now. Like do you go to Disneyland and be like, what kind of bullshit is though? Something like the last time I went to Disney land was here and I went I two years ago and yeah, I was like, you be like, Ooh, space mountain tower of terror on space mountain was the best one. It's pretty bad ass. Yeah. It's even better now cause there's, it's like star wars themed. Is it? Yeah. I don't know if it's permanently star wars themed and be guardians of the galaxy. Oh, they just closed it or about to Oh yeah, they can net.

Speaker 1:          00:35:58       Yeah, the ad graphics and stuff like that. Yeah. Spice it up a bit. Yeah. I liked dlt cups. Yeah, those are fun. That fun. Yeah. But for a guy like you who experienced is real life and death fears like that. Disneyland. Shit's gotta be boring as hell, man. Yeah. It was pretty boring. Pretty Boring. But it's like something you've got to do once in your life, right? I bawled like a little Mickey Mickey Mouse and there's an adult version out here. You've got to go to six flags. Six flags. Yeah. What's the one that's opposite? California is something that's right next to Disneyland. Oh, California adventure. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. That's really good. I felt like the rides were better. Well, it's more, they're more adult oriented, but they have a bunch of kids rides there too. Yeah. But um, six flags. Six flags is way more like the sum of their roller coasters.

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       Just fucking ridiculous on their way. Crazier. Yeah. Way crazier. But it's a different thing. You know, it's not, it's more like older people. It's more like, like high school age and up versus Disneyland's is really fun for little kids. Yeah. Six flags. I got like a lot of shit. It's not even designed for little kids. Yeah. I think that some of those ones where you go upside down some of the roller coaster once and same one, what is it, an x factor or something like that? X something out there. I should go while I'm here. I should check it out if it's a good one. Yeah. It's exciting, but it's just, we're just thinking like, do a guy like you, like that kind of excitement is probably really bland. Yeah. But like I said before, because it's not in my control, it's still kind of gets me a bit. Oh, right. Of course. It's good. Yeah, it's good. Scares me a bit. Do you think long term

Speaker 2:          00:37:30       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       Little bit. Yeah, a little bit. But like, I mean, do you think long term is as far as like how long you can do this stuff? Not really. No. No. That's, that seems to be the thing that people tell me the most. They're like, well, if this is your job now, surely you've got like a, a limited kind of time to it. And like I'm 26 I would say I've still got another 10 years of good strength, good health in me.

Speaker 2:          00:37:57       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       I don't know. I think in that time I can build something else up so I don't need to worry about what happens after. So do you want to stay in some form of entertainment? Like, you know, I'd like to have a good entertainer. Right? Consider yourself, I'm sorry. I hit you with all those career goals. I'm just a dude, but what people call me. Right. You're a professional dude. There's a little data. Yeah. Yeah. It's a new disk distinction nation. I'd like. So after I did the TV thing, I really enjoyed it and I've shot like a couple of pilots since then for things and I think I'd just like to, to have my own TV show. Hmm. Well doing what? Like what would you do? Do Crazy Shit. Wow. The idea in the moment that I shot the pilot for is I travel the world and meeting other extreme athletes and I try out what they do and that's, yeah, good luck getting insurance for that show.

Speaker 1:          00:38:54       That's going to be a problem. You might have to shoot it on your own and sell it somebody. Yeah. Device. So like if, yeah. So if you do something like that and somebody falls, yeah. Then when you do the show it like if I was there and I filmed it, yeah. I wouldn't know. No. What if you show them falling and at the end you just put a smiley face. I put an Emoji, rest in peace, lol, lol, lol. I couldn't do it. You don't see the actual impact. You just see a smiley face. Maybe a bouncing smiley pace where they were going, going, going, and then year dip, dip. That's all folks cut to commercial. By the time you come back, people are thinking about other things are ready, their phone's buzzing and people are texting them. They're trying to get laid. Yeah. Pizza got delivered or over it.

Speaker 1:          00:39:42       I wonder, man, what, what, what would they tell you? Like if you were doing something for a production company, do you think they would want to include all that stuff? Like, yeah. I surely they're not allowed, right? I don't know. I mean, what are they allowed to do and not to do if people died in reality shows before, I got to think they must've done that. Reality shows have been around for quite a long time, but it's the kind of thing that would happen and then they'd cut it out. It's not live though, was it? So you can cut it. Yeah, you would cut it out, but everybody would find out. Hmm. There was a show footage always leaks as well. Yeah, there's always something. But there was a show in the early two thousands where these people were doing some sort of a wilderness adventure type show, like a race through the wilderness.

Speaker 1:          00:40:32       They were on rafts or kayaks or something along those lines on rapids and a woman got trapped. Um, we've got wedge and a rock, her boat, capsize weights, and I think she died. And that was the first one that I had heard of and I was like in the early two thousands but there's gotta be a bunch of them because there's so many shitty reality shows now too. There's so many production companies that are just, yeah, people are going to die. Yeah. People up must be dying already. But that's, is that something that you think about when you're doing this show? Like if you're hanging out with these crazy Russian cats and they're, they're doing these things, it is a possibility. If you do it a thousand times, there is a possibility that one of those times, so I'm just going to fall. Yeah, I dunno.

Speaker 1:          00:41:18       I've, I've been in situations, it was one building in Ukraine where I'm sad. It's like, I think you shared this clip where I'm walking across the white beams and it's like nothing underneath it. Um, and we both walk out to the edge and then Mustang climbs down and hangs off it and I'm looking down at him and I'm thinking like I can, I can create the image in my head of him slipping and just disappearing. Yeah. I've, I've had a few moments like that where I've just kind of tried to imagine what it would look like, but it's not a nice thought. No, it's definitely not a nice thought. But that's the whole reason why it's interesting is because it's possible. But if I was doing a video in here of me hanging from a chin up bar, that's the only a foot off the ground, nobody would give a shit if I'm there looking everybody one arm.

Speaker 1:          00:42:08       Yeah. I'm just like James Kingston and do well, fuck, I'm crazy. No, there's a floor below me. Even if I perform the exact same movements that you do, if I'm not, my life isn't in danger. It's not even interesting at all. The only reason why it's interesting it's because your life is in danger. Yeah, but that's, that's like one of the funny things about it because it is a simple as handing off a bar. Yeah. But people are just like, what? Yeah. Like if there's a small ledge. Oh Jesus. There you go. Barefoot. Huh? How come you decided to go barefoot? You get bad grip barefoot. Jesus son. This is that moment. Yeah. So you're standing up there looking at him. I'm just looking down on him and he's hanging and then he'd like, does this stuff always go on one handed? Oh Jesus Christ. The only goes one handed for a little bit and then he goes back to one handed.

Speaker 1:          00:42:55       Oh you fucker, Yo, fuck. Are you freaking mound? You're freaking me out. And he's just hanging there too, by the way. He's hanging in there. He's still hanging in there. He's one arming it the entire time while this security like patrolling around the button. No idea that were there. Yeah, the clang of his body weight hits that ground, that fuck. And he's laughing and smiling. What is he saying? His hands are slippery. It was, it was a strange color. Like you'd end up with like chalky hands, but it was like a purple. He kind of color from the paint. Yeah. Wow Dude. You guys ready? And he's wearing sneakers. That's the security down there. Let, oh Jesus dog as well. Jump on that dog right from there dude. Um, do you have this, a desire to like keep upping the ante? Is that an issue?

Speaker 1:          00:43:44       Um, not really. No. I just like, ultimately I just like creating stuff and I liked making videos and I liked exploring places. I like heights, I like jumping between stuff. Like the natural progression for me is to, is to get higher and things get bigger. That's just how it is. So it just happens. But bright but not thinking about it. I'm not thinking like, okay, I've just released this so now I need to do something bigger. Like it's just there. It's just not true. So how do you go about making a video? If you decide I'm going to make a new video, like what? Do you have a thought in your head like, I need to get on the Eiffel Tower? Like what? Do you know what? The Eiffel Tower was? Never, never a plan. I never thought, let's go to Paris and do the Eiffel Tower. Did you do the Eiffel Tower?

Speaker 1:          00:44:27       So how'd you do it? If it's not a plan, how'd you do it? So I was in Denmark just traveling around with a bunch of friends and instead of getting in the minivan and driving all the way back to London, I was like, no, I don't want to sit in a van for 15 hours. Let's just fly somewhere and continue this adventure. So me and my friend flew to Paris and then the next day we ended up climbing. Now for tower. Do you think this kind of stuff was being done before people were videotaping it? Like was this must've been, it must have been. I feel like for certain people it's just a, it's just in them to kind of explore places you shouldn't really explore. And I think he's, yeah. Well, for you it seems like something that was fostered though, right? Because you started off just doing the par course tough. And this became of it. But you know what? When I was a kid, I was like, I was annoying little kid. I was always do things that I shouldn't know. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean now I'm just a big, just a big version of what I was then. Wow,

Speaker 4:          00:45:23       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:45:24       Ooh, there's some pretty cool videos. If you look up on youtube of like urban exploration and people were finding weird pathways and like, oh shit. Looked on 60 feet underground, we made it and there's this shit that's been buried under here. Wonder why it's buried and look old electronics fifties and stuff like that. Like under like uncovering the hatch and lost. So it was sort of like that. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:43       Well that's, that's very interesting to me. But what I'm, what I'm really most fascinated by is this willingness to put your life in mortal danger.

Speaker 4:          00:45:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       And that, how exciting this is for people to watch. Like what's the most viewed video that you have? How many hits does it have? A, I think just over 4 million people. Yeah, this one's got a few million I think. Oh, this is you. You get, so we climbed it. We went, we just pushed it too far. Like we went up to the very top platform. If you've been to Paris, no, it didn't say off the tower. So you can take the lift up, right? You can, you can walk. Can you take the stairs to the second platform? That's the highest you can take the stairs too. There is stairs to the top, but they don't allow it because they're like weird and narrow. And so you take the lift to the top and then there's like a door that's always manned by a security guard that is the door to that staircase.

Speaker 1:          00:46:37       And that's what we came up from the backside. So we, we went up, I'm, for some reason we just had the urge to just go inside even though it's lit up, even though there's cameras everywhere. Uh, we opened that door, I step in to the top platform and then I just hear this, this walkie talkie just go like, ah, like you go crazy and French. And I was like, Shit, we've definitely been seen. Let's disappear. So then we ran down, we climbed out of the staircase and then on each, on opposite corners of the tower in the main beams, there's like kind of like a little pocket inside the beam that you can jump into. It must be like two by two. Like size. I barely for intimate, right? Cause I'm huge. My friend is small. So you just like Brooke disappeared into this hole and then we sat on opposite ends of the tower and hid and the lifts, you start hitting lifts coming up, you start hitting people running up and down.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       The stairs you see taught is everything's kicking off and we're hitting these little holes and they're searching for us. And I'm just like hiding in this hole. And I'm like, I've got one shoe off because it wouldn't fit in. I've got my knee wrestling on my shoe, I've lost all feeling in my leg because the blood circulation has gone. My head's sticking out the top and I've got like my tee shirt of my head, like a little Ninja and this people with torches going up and down looking for us. So do you have video on that little pocket that you were in? Uh, it's not in this, no. I do have, it's only on two sides of the tower, which is strange, but it's kind of similar to this gap here. Oh, I see. It's there. It's in the right in that corner there. So yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       And it's like a foot and a half by a foot and a half. I think I barely fit in. So how long did they wait? So we're in the room in, this was coming up right now. Yeah. This is what it was starting to open up. This was like as we, so this is like right where as here, just before we go. Cool. Yeah. So He'd tucked in. It was just before he got caught. So how'd you get caught? Because the lifts started coming up because of that. The staff start coming up to work or to clean or something and they just saw us. We're just like running around these beams and there's lifts everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:48:47       So what happens then? So it like, so we're still in this hole and we sit in this whole for like two hours, at least two hours where they're going up and down. It goes quiet. So I jumped out of the hole. I have a look around, I go and see stevie. Stevie's like half asleep, just chilling in the hole and then come back to the whole. I'm like, yeah, that seems like pretty clear now. I think they must have thought that we jumped off with parachutes and we would go because they couldn't find us. And then I was like, yeah, this seems pretty clear. And then every single light on the tower goes, the whole thing lights up. And this isn't like the twinkly lights that they have on every hour at night. This is like internal lights that are like this big, like the whole fucking tower up.

Speaker 1:          00:49:34       So I jumped straight back in the hole. I'm like, what's going on? And then lifts again, people up and down the stairs again looking for us. So when we sat in these holes again for ages and then, and then it finally goes quiet, the lights are still on for a little while and then the whole thing just shuts down. And I think that was it. So I jumped out, I had a look around to went and got stevie and then it was ours again. And then we were up there until like 9:00 AM I think it was. How long was that? How many hours? A 1:00 AM til 9:00 AM. Wow. So you were climbing around I think for eight fucking hours. That's nuts. Yeah. Running some. That French chocolate barb. She was really good. Oh, that's all you eat. It's all we had. Yeah. So he came down because you were hungry and we came down because we got caught now.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       And so you would have stayed there for the rest of the day. Um, the idea was to like wait till it opened and then get into a, a place where you could hide like near the second platform and then just drop into the second platform and just merge in was like the tourists. But we didn't get that far. That would have been car. So the plan was to wait for it to open and sneak out with the crowd. Just jumped out of the beam into the crowd. Disappearance or lift done. So when you get caught then what happens? So we've got seen by like a big group of people in, in one of the lifts and we just like waving and they're like, ah, like angry looking people but like angry people and happy people. They're like, what the heck's going on? And then, uh, we were like above slightly above and maintenance platform where they have like lifts that take workers up.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       And then, so we had to climb down and we met people on the maintenance platform getting the left. There's like five of us, like to me and Stevie and they're like few other people. Security, just like private security for the tower. And then we come down to like the basement lifts open. There's just like a room full of policemen and we're like go scene in the movie. And when they do that bit, I had to hide every single way, sd card and everything that I had on me. How'd you do that? Three counters? No, no. It was an option. That is the only option. Yeah. I haven't had to do that yet. But he had a condom. You tied in a knot? Yeah. Put them in the condom. Put your finger up, move on. Yeah, that's right. All right. So how do you um, hide the SD cards?

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       I mean they must have went through your stuff for the flight. I thought they would, but they didn't. I don't know. Paris, they don't give a fuck. The attorney delayed drink wine chocolate had like a big five d like a big DSLR. And then I had I think two gopros and so to mike arrestees and one like cf card from the, from the big one. And I had like this bag that I had, like little tiny pen pockets, like really thin pockets. Right. And I just stuffed the Mike cresty cars down there and it had like a, a little rip in the back padding of the bag. So I just threw the CF card in the back of the bag and it just fell down and I just hoped. And then when like we got to the police station, they were like, you have so many cameras on you, clearly you've been filming.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       And I was like, no, I forgot the SD cards. Cameras died. And they, they believed that I had to surrender everything on my phone. I um, you had to surrender everything on your phone. Yeah. So, so I had three cameras, right. So it was like I had three cameras and my phone. So I was like, I'm going to have to give something up to try and save the most valuable, the most valuable footage. So I was like, they were like, did you feel most, I only filmed in my phone because my camera's died and I forgot my SD cards. And then they went through like the footage on the phone just made me delete it or, oh, that's cool. So the, the footage and the phone was like a ruse. The footage on the phone was like me in the, in the little hole filming, talking to the camera and like filming the people looking cause was like this and I put my phone down.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       Great. That you had something to give them. Yeah. Yeah. So now then what happens? How long did they detain you? Uh, we were there for like eight hours. So that another eight hours. So when you're eight hours up there climbing around, how do you pee? You pee off the edge of the town. Oh my God. That's probably where he got arrested. The person on these French people as if life wasn't clicked on them enough. Yeah. I think by the time it gets to the ground, it's kind of all spread out and we're not, or it's a fucking raging river of pis, right. On some little Old Lady's head. Yeah. It seems like if you were, why don't you just pee on the tower that way it dribbles down slowly. It doesn't hit anybody in the head. I mean if you were sitting on the Eiffel Tower and you needed to pay, there was no one below you because it's like 4:00 AM okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:08       You'd pay off the edge. Maybe that's even ruder. I'm sorry enough person. If I did pay on them, maybe it was a romantic couple going for a walk, maybe it would have really worked out. All of a sudden the girl goes to lighter cigarette and you piss running her head and she gets mad and the fucking evening and poorly and they could have, it could have been a perfect relationship, but you ruined it. I killed it. Yeah. So you come down and then another eight hours of detention. Yeah. And what do they do to you? Handcuffed us to a chair. We just sat in the middle of the, of this police station. There's like sales behind us with people going crazy and like people bleeding from the eyeballs and we just sat there like people bleeding from the rivals, from other crimes, nighttime fights and stuff like that and just drunk people.

Speaker 1:          00:54:53       And we just sat there for ages and then we finally got taken into separate rooms where we were questioned by some high up, I had a woman, he had a dude and we were both questioned for a couple hours and then we were back out handcuffed to the chairs again. And then they took all of our stuff and they searched it and I was like, well, if they find it, they're going to be like, okay, you just told us that you feel nothing. And we've just found hours and hours of footage, like what's the deal? So I was like, oh please. Cods. Yeah. And then, um, they finally brought the, brought the bags back. Like it must've been an hour. They had them full and I thought they were going to go through everything, but they brought it back. I checked it and I was like, [inaudible] the gods are still here. Then we just like, we just lost it. We were so happy. But the, the policemen, I had no idea what we were doing. So did they kick you out of the country? No. Record. And I said nothing at all. So I had to go back to that room. I had to sign an agreement that said, I promise I will not climb the Eiffel Tower for three years. For three years. That's it. That was it. Yeah. Wait a bad them. Right. How come they only give you, how can we, I'll take forever.

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       They must like it. Yeah. You know what? Interviewing me, he loved it. She did. She was like, you really shouldn't be doing this, but how did you do this? It's incredible. Like she loved it. Why Oak? He loved it. Yeah. Well, I think once they realize that you're polite, you're a gentlemen, you're a very nice guy. You're just a thrill seeker. They're like, okay, this is not a threat to society. Yeah. Sky's in a terrorist. Yeah. So the second question she asked me was, did you leave a bomb up there? Oh God. And I just laughed. I was like, what? Come on. Oh Wow. Well, that's something they have to take any consideration. They have to actually trust you. Right? If they let you go and turns out you did leave a bottom up down [inaudible] then they have to like, they would have to comb over the building with a fine tooth comb and you just say he's going to be like, yeah, you know what I did? I left the bulb up there. No, no one would write. So they really have to trust you. Yeah. Fucking Europeans. Ridiculous, ridiculous people. Three years. Fuck you. You throw me in jail forever. His America, they put you right in Guantanamo Bay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       They throw dogs in there with you. Cool. It just seems like um, they're a little bit looser over there. A little more relaxed about things. Yeah. I was under, I was driving from La to San Fran a couple of weeks ago up the one is it the one amazing drive and I find like a couple of cranes. I went and saw like some elephants, the elephant seals and then shortly after that I just found like a building site on the site, like near the beach, like a hundred meters back from the beach. I was like, of course I need to stop. And just do this because it's dead. It was, um, what we can, was it a holiday weekend? Right. So I did it and I stopped and I climbed it and then I'm at the top and I looked down. So I had like a rental Mustang and I popped the Mustang in the site, like on the top of this peak, it looked really cool, but you could see it from the road.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       So a cop, cops driving past, he sees the Mustang. He was like, what's going on? So he pulls in and he's walking around looking, and then you looked up and he sees me at the top of this crane and he's like, you get your ass down here right now. And I was like, fuck, this is the first time I got caught in the U S I was like, shit, what's going to happen? Well, you in California, it's better than getting caught in like Arizona. Yeah. Yeah. This is Texas. The shoot. You just shoot me. Yeah. Okay. I'll bear that in mind. That's what I'm scared of. That's what I'm scared of him when the UK, what? We know that the cops over here to be like this, they just shoot people. That's like what we're told, you know, that's what they feed us. You're white. You gonna be okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:35       Um, so the guy gets you down the woods. She was telling me, get out of there. He shouts at me. Yeah, I've got this all on video as well. He shouts at me, I come down and then he just lays into me. Yeah. Asking me from England, you don't know any better. Exactly. Yeah. It was like, oh, in England it's nicely. Well, you're not an, you're in the United States of America, boy, and you need to do what you should do. So yeah. So he doesn't want to fill out the paperwork. It took my driver's license. He checked all my stuff and then he, he was like, okay. He came back after like 10 minutes. He was like, okay. So I made a decision and I'm going to leave this in the hands of the site manager. So he goes and he tries to find a site manager, but it's a holiday weekend.

Speaker 1:          00:59:16       Nobody's there. So he goes to the office, he phones up some number on the, on the door and he speaks to the site manager and the site managers just got back to La from, from where he's working. And he was like, you know what? I've just got back home. I cannot be bothered to deal with this. So just, just let him go and then we just go. And that was it. What is the worst you've ever gotten in trouble? Uh, there's nothing, you know, nothing. There's nothing like bad. Are you worried now though there with your Internet fame that now you're getting millions of hits in these videos that people are gonna, they're gonna recognize you and maybe even like a target you yeah. Set an example. Yeah. I don't know. I've thought about it, but it doesn't seem to happen. Happen. It seems to be getting easier because that all shit Yo, this guy like can I take a picture of that?

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       That's just how it works. Do you worry that you're encouraging people that are not as competent or thoughtful as you? Um, I'm worried that somebody that is a bit silly, you might see it and think, oh, I need to do this to, to be cool or to look cool in front of my mates. Like young kids. Right? The allegory about that. Yeah, but there's not much I can do. Like there's, there's so many more things out there that are so easily available on the Internet that kids could watch and be inspired by. And like I'd just, I always make it clear that what I'm doing is just, well, I want people to get from this is like I'm just going out exploring the world, live in my life in a way that I enjoy doing things that make me happy, pushing myself, developing myself, becoming a better person, a stronger person.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       And that's it. And climbing and jumping around. It's just my way of doing it. Like we all have our own little passions, right? That's just mine. Yours might be badminton or like something Ping Pong. That's another thing that's interesting that's happening now with the larger number of content providers, like so many people like yourself that are doing things like this. The idea that one person is responsible for their influence becomes less and less plausible. It just comes more like, well, what is he representing? Well, he's representing a 26 year old guy who absolutely knows how to do that. You know? It's not, you don't have to do what he's doing, but he can do what he's doing. So are you supposed to stop doing what you're doing? Which you obviously very case actually, because you're not a good example with, they're the perfect example of someone doing it correctly.

Speaker 1:          01:01:36       Yeah, exactly. But that people just don't just don't get that well. The idea that you're influencing people is always, it's always very tricky because we'll please supposed to do, he's supposed to live your life in a cushion room so no one gets injured because that's the only way to influence people positively. You know? In terms of like if you're going to do risky things, you could always be an example or be an inspiration to someone who's not as competent as you. Yeah. I'm naked. Risk, death or injury. Yeah. I don't think, honestly I don't think anybody is stupid enough to see it go out and try it. Like most people on Earth. Right. Can put them up a crane and they'll shit themselves. Yeah. I didn't think any 12 year old, 14 year old kid is going to say it and be like, oh dude to the, to the climate. Right. And off it. I just don't see that happening. Oh, they're definitely gonna do it. I disagree. There's going to be a bunch of them. Yeah. There's a lot of crazy fucks out there. Just like you pal. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:02:30       It's be on me. Like I can't, Russians have been doing it longer than I have flat. Did they start this stuff? Yeah. As far as I know. Yeah. He went up there with big ass heavy cameras and stuff. I saw was Russians big ass fucking boom box cameras. Yeah. I wonder who the first guy was to climb up on top of some beam. Cause I saw one where there was a a steel girder that it was extended out into the forest by rusty, right? Yeah. And it's trees everywhere. Asked for the first one I saw it was, it might've been the first one. Yeah. That one's doing push ups and all that. Yes. That fuck yeah. Russia. That's right. I want to go. Then I really want to go there because it's still there. Oh No, don't do it. And he's not that picture where he's like, this is epic.

Speaker 1:          01:03:14       Yeah, here it is. Do you these hanging upside down and he's extending his lens. This guy's out of his fucking mind. He's doing like flips and he's doing chin ups and he's letting go of his hands. He's doing chin ups and he gets to the top. He lets go of his hands and he's doing several of them. He's doing one leg with one leg crossed over the other one kind of winded. Oh my God. They're balancing on their hands over these beans. That's the one fucking Jesus Christ. This is driving me nuts. But you see like there's a bunch of videos of dudes in this place. I know. Well how many people have died from this place? It must be a few. Oh my God. Look at this guy gripping. Ooh, this is so scary. Good Lord. This is so sad,

Speaker 5:          01:04:04       Gary. As a watch. This video isn't that old. Do you think this may be started once the, sorry, once cameras became the portable enough to get up there, like the small little flip cams and blogging cam. Yeah. Maybe it wasn't, you weren't capable of taking a big ass vcr camera like you got a drone in one of yours. I saw them and drones are being able to do live video now. Look at my hands. He could, I could. I could like ring the out in a glass

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       right now. I'm watching this video and I'm freaking out and these guys are doing it and they're laughing. You know, they're so high up. Look at that forest below them. Yeah, I think, I think you're right that people have always probably done this.

Speaker 4:          01:04:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:44       Amazing feats of athleticism too. If you look at this guy bouncing in his hands, his feet up boxes, full plank hanging off. Look at this guy. I mean that is, that's some serious fucking strength.

Speaker 4:          01:04:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:56       I mean it's just, it's such a crazy endeavor.

Speaker 5:          01:05:02       Where are you doing some of this before you could film it like before you even had a camera. So it's not just about showing people. Okay. Do you know anybody who's fallen and died?

Speaker 1:          01:05:11       Um, no. None personally. You know, there was a, it was a park old guy that fell off a rooftop. He was doing a back. Some are still on the edge of a rooftop from you, like a wool like this, which is like an easy thing to do, but something must've got to him and he fell off and he died. Yeah. 16 stories, I think. Woo. This is recent. Couple of years ago, I think. Where do you fall? What place? Uh, I think it was Russia. That's pretty sure it was rush. You Google it, you'll find it. So it's surprisingly few deaths. Yeah. That we know about the, a publicized, I don't see that many.

Speaker 1:          01:05:51       Yeah. Which is good. I guess. Yeah, for sure. So you're planning a lot of leads me to believe that people aren't stupid enough to go out and mess up. Well, it's such a scary thing to do that it just takes a very small percentage of people. Yeah. And, and it grabs a hold of them and says, you got to do this too. Yeah. There's a video that's actually on youtube that probably shouldn't be on youtube. Have somebody fill me from the ground up at a crane and a guy like walks across the top beam of the crane and falls and you'd just see his body just, Oh God. Yeah. It's disappears behind some of the building. Well, I think as long as it doesn't hit the bottom, they'll that you show it. Yeah. And then we have rules like that. Like you'd know the guy had died. Yeah. Which you can't see it.

Speaker 4:          01:06:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:38       Strange. So 10 more years of this. I Dunno. I Dunno. You're not thinking about the future. You're just a wild man. I was just the wild man. Yeah. Living on the edge. Yeah. Just see what it's all like. Yeah. Wow. It's like pointing to thinking that far ahead. You know, I could die tomorrow, we could all die tomorrow. It could all get hit by a bus or we could live and then you go, fuck, why didn't I think about tomorrow? Yeah. It's not a bad idea. A plan, assuming you will live. Police released horrell video of school by falling a hundred feet to his death as warning to daredevils. Police in Russia. I've released the horrifying video at Russia. Yeah, we don't need to see this Jamie.

Speaker 1:          01:07:18       This kid is going to fall and I'm going to freak out even farther. Like I've seen this. Yeah. What other interests do you have to train side's doing this kind of crazy shit I do or not? No other sports really. I just love filmmaking. I just love making videos. I love filming stuff. I love taking pictures. I love creating these little films and it's like both of my passions just work hand in hand. I've got the Parker and the climbing stuff and I've got the filmmaking. Do you ever film stuff that's not scary and Dario and stuff and do people need to do more of that? Do People respond to that? Yeah, I um, so I put out a video a couple of months ago of my new car, like at my new car video. So it's basically like a car review. Right. And people love it. Oh, I think I might've seen that.

Speaker 1:          01:07:59       Do you have an m three and four for a new one? Yeah. I think I did see that. People like it. It's like 200 normal guys. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great car. It's an amazing Chi. And you got that car from money that you made from risking your life? Yeah. Wow. Yeah. From like Youtube ads and stuff. Is that what it is? Cheated money. Sponsorships, everything. There's a beautiful car. They're so well engineered. Yeah. Look at it, man. It's a piece of law. It is. I had an m three. The last one. Yeah. I had the old one. The Old v eight. Yeah. Yeah. This is interesting that the v six turbo, right? You like it like it's a completely different sound. But I like it. I used to have like a turbo charged car before the va m three and I missed all the, the little hisses and the wobbles and I missed it, so now I've got it back.

Speaker 1:          01:08:47       That's stuff much faster. A lot of people like the roar of the v eight yeah, it's the big complaint about the m three m four rather. He doesn't have that roar and it doesn't, it's completely different, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't compare them. I wouldn't say all the m three is better. It's just a different, it's a different breed, you know? It's like, well we're getting used to cars that you make. Those electric cars are becoming more and more prevalent. I saw that the Tesla numbers the other day, Jamie, it's 2.5 seconds, so let, it's so less than three it's 2.5 they like the model x, like the big one as well as the other. Really. I think the big ones a little silly. It's sub three I'm just say this week too. I wonder if they updated the speed, like the software update, like a foam or update at speed to your car. Yeah, it's nuts. It's crazy. Elon Musk, man, he's, he's killing it. He's on the spectrum for sure. Right. Gotta be super wizard. Yeah. He's an alien. He's probably, yeah. This, uh, those people, those like people that pushed things like that. What does this zero to 60 in 2.5 seconds has 315 miles of range. Not if you'd go that fast.

Speaker 1:          01:09:54       It's 289 miles. What does that stop lying? What does it say? Is it a different one and model two? They make that sweet one, that little tiny one. Do they still, there's Tesla's still make that little sports car one. Nah, they don't, they, they released them in limited numbers. The little tiny one. The little little lotus look at him. Yeah. Yeah. That Lotus looking one was beautiful that first wasn't it? Yeah. But it is on skinny tires and apparently the weights all fucked up. It's like Porsche nine 11, but way to the extreme cause all the weights in the back. Yeah. Just like a Porsche, but way more weight. Yeah. So it's like if you go around a corner and the asset and kicks out on you, you just won't know. Or if you're going around a corner and you're hitting the gas and you let off the gas, you know, you get that, that tail end Sorta pendulums out on you.

Speaker 1:          01:10:47       But the beauty cause man to you cause it fun. Yeah, me too. I'm a big fan. Big Fan of engineering drive. Um, my favorite car, I have a Porsche nine 11 gt three r s dude. Yeah. I have an older one, a 2007 when there were still manually. Yeah. They don't make manuals anymore. Now they're all up those paddle shifts, which is a, they're really fun but it's just not as fun. Yeah, it's different. Yeah. I'm a big fan of a clutch. Not just one thing I like about the m four. It's one of the few high end sports cars where you could still get it, that clutch all the American cars do it. Like corvettes. Yeah. You still get with a clutch, but like a Porsche Porsche's, the Gt three and the gt three Rs. Now you gotta get automatic Ferrari only automatic. Yeah, that's my car.

Speaker 1:          01:11:34       That was before I took the painting off the, the wheels are off the side, the gt three Rs logo. I'm like, that's a little school boy racer. Now it's just white. But those are uh, what I like about those cars is not even really growing that fast as the connection. Like when you're going around corners, it literally is like a ride. It feels like a Disneyland ride cause it's so hard. Yeah. And it's also the engineering, like you can appreciate the amount of thought and trial and error in calculation that's involved and creating something that's so capable. You know, when you drive a regular car, you know, it's just a car. You drive and around and you drive one of those things around and you're on a ride, you know? Yeah. So Siphon, yeah, me too. I'm a big fan. So do you, this is like all your life.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       You just enjoy making videos, taking photos and doing these crazy stunts and filming them and he just living day by day and keep on keeping on living the dream. Yeah, you are. And a lot of ways, man. I mean there's a lot of kids that are going, wait a minute, you could just do chin ups on a crane. You can get a fucking BMW. Yeah. You'd be surprised how many people are like, you don't deserve this. Oh fuck those people. Because you're risking your goddamn. What you do is what you do is climb ladders and listen. People watch the videos. Jealousy. Does this tell us you're always going to have that? Yeah. Here's going to have haters. Do they motivate you? Nah, that just let me laugh. Haters do. Yeah. Do you have a place that you want to go? Hong Kong. Oh Chinese don't fuck around dog, but she looked at some videos from Hong Kong.

Speaker 1:          01:13:15       Man, it's the place to be, but if you get caught over there they might throw you in a hole. I don't know. I don't know. I think a few people who have been banned from Hong Kong for like some years or forever. I've not, I've not heard anything bad. I think I would imagined that anytime you get arrested in a foreign country, he was this Hong Kong. Oh High Rise Hong Kong. It's guys walking around with a selfie stick sponsors. Oh my God. He's shown his sponsors. Who the fuck would have been at backup. Backup is sponsors. Yeah. Backup. Click pause. What is this? Jet Flight search engine. Jet Radar flight search engine. Hotel. Look. Hotel search engine. So what's that was her sponsors. What's happened here is he's been like, okay, I need to get to Hong Kong but I have money. I need to get a hotel in Hong Kong by die of money.

Speaker 1:          01:14:05       I'm going to contact a flight company and a hotel company and see if I can get them to give me both for video. But how insane are those companies that they like? What are you going to do some illegal shit in China? Yeah, man. Yeah man. Put My name up there. I want to, I want people to know 1 million, 100,359 views. That's why I like fuck it. Have a lot of those people are going to use our service. A couple of those buildings I guess if the guy lived, it's not negative, right? Yeah. If you made it through. Yeah, exactly. It's like, yeah, that's the deal. If you uh Oh my God, this is so bananas gloves. Oh He's got clubs on you. You think he's a pussy for wearing gloves. I mean, but that's like, that's like a pole background, but the idea is to not have to rely on anything.

Speaker 1:          01:14:53       Like you build your hands up so that you can do shit like this and not have to worry about cutting your finger. Now when you were doing park horse stuff, we do in like back flips off buildings and stuff. Have you ever seen that video where this kid in the ghetto, he's on a second floor roof and he does a back flip and lands on the ground? Yeah, probably. It's, I've seen some seriously high. One fucking crazy. Like, how does a guy live from that far away? You did. You just learn how to land. How does he learn how to land land in landing away, right? Your legs take as much of the impact as they physically can. And then you smash your bum until the ground and then you just do it backwards. Roll. That's it. Watch this guy. And if you bumped back, flip off the 40 foot roof. I think this smashes his head. Yeah, for sure. But what's crazy is he actually did this. He did a back flip. Like somebody gave him something like a dollar or something crazy, right? Wasn't it like 20 bucks or something ridiculous with this dude? Like he's standing there.

Speaker 6:          01:15:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:51       And this is no one had to please don't hurt yourself. Please look at this. I'm going gonna say a prayer. You hear that? I'm ready. I don't even want to look at that. What? You're not going to turn away either though, are you? You want to be there. So this guy is standing there with his back. He's building height right now. Here it goes.

Speaker 6:          01:16:18       Smash. And he made it.

Speaker 1:          01:16:25       I'm good bro. I'm good. Holy Shit. He's got strong bones would be snapped. Yeah, that is. And that was a hard surface he fell onto. Yeah. You would just think that if someone just jumped, like, is the flip helping at all? Does how's that? Just because of the momentum is it's going this way instead of just going to slam straight down.

Speaker 1:          01:16:52       I think it makes sense some of that into that, which is like, you know, when you see people jumping massive roof gaps and they laugh and they roll, that's converting all this downwards momentum into a forward and to Ford. And that, that means you can jump a lot further than you think. Oh, that's interesting. So, but how do you, if you have to drop straight, what do you do? A, you lied and you just slam your hands until the ground as well. Spread out. The impact is as best you can. Yeah. It rolls are any good, really a feel going forward. Quite a lot. So running. So if you had to jump off of that 40 foot high wall, that guy was on, how would you jump? Uh, I'd probably hang off the edge and just straight drop. Um, yeah. It's not one that, that's not that high at the fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:17:32       Are you saying you don't think you'd have a problem making that jump? No. Really? Yeah, I've done big drops. It helps. I'm big as well. So does it, but makes it your heavy too, right? Yeah, but I, my legs a lot. I've got good legs, man. My legs like my strongest thing. Do you exercise or do you just do a lot of that? Just the exercise comes from doing it and that's it. And how often do you do it now? Not so much. I used to do a lot, like I used to go out every day and train all day and just repeat jumps and everything. Now it's kind of like bill in me, but it doesn't have, it's not a problem. Like as the more famous you get, the more obligations you get, the less time you have to practice and the more people expect of you do crazier shit.

Speaker 1:          01:18:13       It's a problem. Yeah. But fuck, yeah, don't die dude. You seem like a nice guy. No it die. Please don't. That'd be, it'd be a wonderful story if you made it through this thing. Yeah, no problems at all. And you know, people be like, look, you just, the only thing you have to fear is fear itself. Yeah. That's true. Anything else to add to the people before we get the fuck out of here? No, not really. Thanks for watching. Thanks for watching. Thanks for having me on please. My boss room.

Yeah. Whoa. So they're the kings of this shit that I guess. Yeah man,
