Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Boom. What was the original pronunciation? Well, standing is back in the old days, it was Sam the butcher and Joe the barber, and, and my great grandfather was a husband, which is a singer of holy songs, like cantor would be the term now. And when my grandfather came to Ellis island, he didn't speak English and they wrote it up as h a s s a n. And so I've lived my life being thought of as an Arab, being persecuted at times by Jews. I'm actually Jewish and I belonged to the persecuted you. I've had experiences where people made yes, your name because of the spelling of my name. Let them, hey, you asshole, I'm one of you. Well first they'd say, you know, being a bigot. And then I'd say, by the way, I'm Jewish. And what did they say? I'm so sorry. They would look at me and then they'd say, you don't look Sephardic.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       I'm on Ashkenazi. But uh, anyway, it's, you know, like act with some dignity and compassion and kindness. Yeah. Especially for no reason. It's not like you did something antisemetic right. The first time I was actually physically assaulted was during the six day war back in the 60s when I was in elementary school and on a stairwell in Queens, New York. You were assaulted because of your ethnicity? I was assaulted by Jews who thought I was an Arab. Jesus Christ. And they, they attacked me and I threw them down. I grew up, I grew up in my father's hardware business, so I kind of like knew how to pick up a hundred pound bags of rock salt and stuff. So they like fell on the floor. And then I said, you schmuck some Jewish. I like how you schmuck that way.

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       No, he's in Judaism. Sort of a cult. So let me just explain what Steve Does. Anyway. Steve Hassan. Hassan. Hassan. Hassan. Hassan. Yes. Yes. Um, you, you, you wrote a book, um, combating cult mind control. I got ahold of you because of my friend Nate quarry who used to fight for the UFC and a, he is one who, uh, uh, connected me to you. And uh, he was a Jehovah's Witness for Awhile and, uh, grew up in it. Yes. Yes, he did. And he wrote me a really interesting email about the mind control process of that. That particular call, your book combating cult mind control, um, is, um, right here it says number one bestselling guide to protection, rescue and recovery from destructive cults is Judaism McCall.

Speaker 1:          00:02:36       So first let me just say that book first came out in 1988 and it had a fellow on the front cover who looked a little bit like you but, but clean shaven and he had a pad lock and a chain around his forehead. I hated it. I told the publisher I hated it. They created the artwork, did the artwork. And anyway, it's been out for 25, 27 years now in hardback. And

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       I've finally bought the rights back and I've updated it post-internet including terrorists and human trafficking and including people born into cults like the Jehovah's Witnesses. So that said, um, I grew up in a conservative Jewish family, the youngest of three. My mom was an art teacher. My Dad had a hardware store. It as a musician before that and after that, um, and I really didn't like the Judaism that I was taught, but I was very close to my mom and my maternal grandfather. He was Orthodox and I grew up with a spiritual feeling and connection. I may still feel that connection and I'm actually part of an alternative Jewish community for the last 17 years. But the, the point that I want to say is that there's a whole range and I actually gave you a blow up of a graphic, I don't know if you're going to use it, but have ethical influence and unethical influence. And the idea is that one can look at specific behavioral components and determine whether or not it's a destructive cult or a benign cult or constructive cult. So the word called in and of itself tends to be pejorative, but as someone who is quoted in the book called the cult of Mac as a disciple, uh, myself and the book, uh,

Speaker 4:          00:04:23       Max, yeah. Max Being Apple.

Speaker 3:          00:04:24       Yeah. That was literally interviewed by this writer who actually has a website called the called the Mac. And he said, your editor, my editor said, I have to interview you. And I said, what about writing a book about computers? I said, that's weird. That's not the typical interview. I go, what's the title? He said, the cult of Mac, and I laughed. I said, I've been using apple since 1982 and a half, five Max right now, but if you still want me to do an interview, I'll be happy to do it.

Speaker 4:          00:04:52       I do believe that people, there are certain people that are in a cult of Mac, 100% and I noticed it in the 90s when I was on Newsradio, all the people on the staff, all the people that work behind the scenes, they would get so excited when a new ios operating system came out, apple s and they would talk about it like we've got a new one now. It's going to be better than windows. It's going to be amazing. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:05:12       Science is a social science to creating a called, but again, I, I cite the bite model and site that you know, if there's deception, so there's lack of informed consent. If does extreme use of fear and guilt. If there's information control where people are being told you can't talk to critics or or defectors or you need to cut off from family or friends who are questioning you. That's I'm, I'm concerned about human rights. I think the easiest way to understand what I do as a former cult member myself, it's really in support of the United Nations Universal Declaration of human rights,

Speaker 4:          00:05:49       not necessarily anti cult. You are anti negative cults that have a detrimental effect on a person's life.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       Yeah, and I would actually blow the frame up a little bit bigger since I've been doing this work for 39 years and I would say I'm against undue influence. Undue. How do you, it's a legal term for exploitative influence as compared to ethical influence where it like a therapist is trying to help somebody to confront their fears or as a influence of helping somebody who is addicted to something that's that's killing them. When you put a lot of religions in that category, then that classification of undue influence, right, so the B you asked me is Judaism and halt. The answer is there are Jewish cults for sure. And there are lots of other Jewish temples and affiliations that are not destructive cults. So what would you consider them?

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       Them meaning the positive ones? I belong to Temple Beth scion in Brookline, Massachusetts. Brookline agree. My, my rabbi wrote the Big Book of Jewish humor and he was a comedian for most of his adult career. He became a rabbi later on, uh, emotional wall docs and he cracks jokes even during Yom Kippor and he's my kind of rabbi. It's not it, it's gay friendly women's Center, social justice. But we love to sing. We left the chant. We love to dive in. We love to do oven. Davening is, is religious prayer. Oh, okay. Going through the side door and learning toe or I love to go to tourist study. It, it resonates for me, uh, in terms of my spiritual path. That said, I've also studied Buddhism and I have a teacher who was teaching me a Korean form of meditation and movement. He's a martial artists by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       Oh yeah. Korean martial arts would kind, he's a swordsman. Swordsman so it does like Kendo or something, something like that. The version of like the real sword thing. Endo is a real art of sword and they just use bamboo sticks. We kind of know his Japanese legs. Yes. Yeah. Um, I learned a little bit of that in the movies they would teach you in the moonies Kendo really shiny. It's nice to teach a little zone. It's probably just in case they have to take over the world and everybody's out of, boy, I hope we have a chance to chat about the moonies at some point we will definitely call chat about the moonies. So you, so you, would you say your, uh, by doing this being involved in an organized religion and ancient organized religion in a sec that you feel as positive, would it be just more of a community of philosophy and maybe just a, a just a, a nice group of people that, well, it is a nice group of people.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       Fans. We are independent, although were influenced by the renewal movement of Zalman Checked Shola me, but we're trying to, what does that mean? Where that's the name of a, of a spiritual leader, a rabbi who passed away who basically said, yeah, and he liked to smoke pot. By the way. I like him already. He talked about like updating the traditions for the modern time and that we need, the whole point is growth and connection to other beings in a loving, compassionate way. It's not about being exclusive. It's not about putting other people down to be on your path. It's about awareness and consciousness. Well, that sounds like a very healthy perspective. I don't think I would be part of a spiritual community after everything I've been through that wasn't super healthy and giving me more than I was taking from me. Are you allowed to eat bacon in that group?

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       People eat bacon. I personally don't eat bacon. My wife Loves Bacon, but uh, we're, we're not. We drive to temple. I live several miles away. My rabbi drives to temp even on Saturday on Shabbat. Whoa. But you know, it's more important to show up at temple then too, you know, then to Miss Temple, some mystical. So the, all of the carbs, the rules should serve the spiritual purpose and not the other way around that these people are just compressed into this rigidity, right, of conformity and obedience and guilt and shame that we are not into guilt and shame. We're into joy and love and laughter and helping one another. That sounds very ideal. As far as Cultco I, I think so. So it's a call. It was just a really good one. It's a good, um, some people in Boston call it a cult and I'm like, I'm a happily say, I've been there for 17 years, from the very beginning of his, uh, his invitation to become a rabbi there.

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       And we've had our ups and downs, but it's, it's healthy, it's accountable. Uh, the membership make the agenda. It's not tap top down, you know, a dictatorship type thing. It's the membership and a downs. What's the downs? Um, there was some personality power conflicts with teen and an assistant rabbi and Moshe that was, um, other, you know, just always how it works. So he's some power struggle, you know, human beings are imperfect. And the key is, is you know, if somebody calls you on your shit that you step back and you listen and you reflect and you the correct your, your your behavior or you don't. And if you don't and you're, and if you're a part of a community like that in a leadership role, then they ask you to leave. And so that was what was going on there. Uh, in that particular case, I think she wanted more say so she didn't want to be the assistant rabbi. I don't know all the checks be rabbis. Oh yeah. We have, haven't, we have an assistant rabbi right now arrived. Claudia who is amazing. And this is rob, like the form like doc, I'm sorry. Yeah, it's like rabbi, Rabbi means teacher is a female you call rob or is it distinction for a male as well? No, you can call a a male, a Ralph also see this

Speaker 4:          00:12:17       weird to me that you were like an anti cult guy, but this is clearly, um, at the very least a very strong ideology with some pretty rigid

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       sort of classifications of things. Is that, is that fair to say? I mean Judaism as the one that you yeah, it seems to go here and we'll get started. Nobody makes me, it's fine. Uh, it's not the typical interview that I'm asked to do, but then again, I didn't expect us to be. What is it? Well, it's not just conversation, really try not to interview people. Yeah. Okay. Um, for me, I just want to grow and, and I like being part of a group that's bigger than myself, particularly one that's interested in helping Boston where members of the Greater Boston interfaith organization where we're fighting for justice to raise minimum wage to help, uh, get rid of agregious banking fees on immigrants. Um, we bring in pro Palestinian peace activists to speak. We bring in, um, Steve Hassan to speak about costs to all kinds of interesting programming. And I love being part of a community. And on a personal note, when I had cancer nine years ago, I had Hodgkin's lymphoma. People were offering to drive me to the hospital, make us meals, and it was just great to feel like we weren't alone facing that. That's great.

Speaker 4:          00:13:51       What I always hear from people that are in Christian churches that really, uh, really enjoy it. They really enjoy the community and they really enjoy the bond that they have with all these folks. And that it seems like coming together and sitting together on Sunday or whenever you do it and worshiping that really, in fact, part of what's going on there is you're all making this sort of agreement to look at the possibility of there being a higher good for all of us and that you all joined together in this and then you get this, this bonding, this feeling of community that we kinda don't really have that much in this world. A lot of folks don't know their neighbors. They don't, you know, they just, I have a buddy lives in an apartment building, it's like 50 floors. He doesn't know a fucking single person in the entire building. Yeah. I'm like, that's so crazy and isolated. Hundreds and hundreds of people. You don't even know who they are.

Speaker 1:          00:14:42       Right. And that's part of what needs to be changed in my opinion, and make the world a healthier place where people do know their neighbors and they do offer our help. Uh, if, if somebody needs help,

Speaker 2:          00:14:55       beauty of small towns, the beauty of less people is those people get appreciated more. It's sort of like a, you know, you can have too much stuff and then that stuff doesn't have any value anymore. Or you can have one cherished item that like, wow, this is the baseball glove my dad gave me when I was 10 and I will cherish it forever instead of like a fucking warehouse full of baseball gloves. They don't mean Jack Shit to you. And I think human beings are kind of a warehouse full of baseball gloves. It's just so many of us that it's, we sort of lose value. We'll lose an appreciation for us because there's so many of them.

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       Uh, that's part of it. I also think that, you know, modern culture and civilization and technology has created a, uh, a false, um, construct of what's important and what's real, where beingness and being part of a family or a community or a tribe mattered as a central theme of our identity. Now it's consumerism and, and what status you have at your job or how much you're making or what car you're driving and where you're going on vacation. And this information overload and sleep deprivation that is very troubling. Sleep deprivation. How so? Um, it's probably one of the most studied a phenomenon, the effects on the, on the mind and on, um, on the brain lack of sleep. And it's one of the classic techniques used by destructive cults by the way, is sleep deprivation. But if one analyzes American society, my understanding is that the average American is sleep deprived.

Speaker 2:          00:16:39       Isn't that one of the things that Scientology supposedly does to those folks that they have that work for pennies? The, would they call them c Corp?

Speaker 1:          00:16:46       Uh, uh, it's the, it's a C or c or billion year contract

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       billion. And that hilarious. You signed a billion year contract.

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       Yeah. Um, and I want to mention that I was part of a, a five day seminar in Toronto a few weeks ago called getting clear and some of the top former officials of Scientology were interviewed on stage. I was on stage talking about hypnosis cause Hubbard was a hypnotist and a lot of the processes in Scientology or straight out of a hypnosis textbook from the 20s thirties which is when Hubbard was reading about it, is like doing auditing. Such a mean. Yeah. So to sit with your feet flat on the floor and your hands in your lap and you're closing your eyes and just being there.

Speaker 5:          00:17:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       Not Reacting for 20 minutes. The Scientologists will tell you, oh Joe, you just licked your lips or your knee quiver. No, you've got to just free is for 20 minutes. It's creating an altered state of consciousness known as trance. And I know we're going to talk more about trans. I'm sure there's nothing wrong with trance states, but when you're in a trance state, you're more suggestible. Someone who has authority and who has an agenda to implant ideas in your head because you're not in your critical analytic part of your mind.

Speaker 2:          00:18:16       So just sitting for 20 minutes with your hands in your lap and your feet flat would lead you to be more influenced by someone suggestions.

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       It's the first one. The next one is sitting opposite of Scientologists three feet away, staring into the Scientologists eyes for 20 minutes. That's the next step. That's the next one that Jamie, it's really hot in here cause ac on out. And the next one after that is bull baiting where you have to stare straight forward and the Scientologists tries to get you to react or respond. It's like a bowl with a red k. Really? Yeah. So they are training obedience. There di Di desensitizing people from normal social cues and interactions and they're cultivating a compliant, obedient trans identity as a scientologist.

Speaker 2:          00:19:17       I didn't know that. Just staring at someone just staring into someone's eyes can create an altered state of consciousness. Can, a bunch of kids are going to race, actually staring at it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       The candle staring at a spot on a wall of it's known in hypnosis language as an eye fixation technique is of very, very common technique for inducing an altered state of consciousness. Why? Because the eyes are pretty wired to move and scan. And when you, and I should also say hypnosis is not sleep. It's an altered state of consciousness that's the best characterized as concentration or absorption. And um, and I just want to say one more time. There's nothing wrong with that state. I liked that state. I do self hypnosis. I do meditation, I do many different altered states, uh, techniques. The point is I'm in control. I'm deciding I don't have somebody who's alienating me from my own inner voice and my own self and trying to imprint me with an a totalistic ideology that's black and white. US versus them. Good versus evil.

Speaker 2:          00:20:29       So let's talk about you. You, you got into the moonies that's, and you were there for two years, is that what it was? Yeah. Two and a half years. Two and a half years. And that led you to try to get a greater understanding of cults, the cult mind control and to help people. What was your experience? How old were you in 19 is that what you were

Speaker 1:          00:20:46       I was a, I had skipped

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       eighth grade. I was an extra honors student. I was a creative writing major at Queens College. Humblebrag see that? Just kidding. Um, so you were an honest reading Plato

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       eight. I wasn't too Utopian novels when I was nine, but aside from that Copia novels, it was, I was wanting an ideal world and looking around at what I saw in the media and the Russians are going to nuke us. And already I was sensitized to global climate change way back then. I was in the last draft lottery to go to Vietnam. Anyway, I had been basically dumped by my girlfriend checks. I do it every time and I was kind of bummed and I was sitting in the cafeteria waiting for my new semester to start and three women pretending to be students stress like students carrying books. Like students asked if they can share my table and they started asking me about the books and I had from students. No, they were moonies. Wow. And it was a deceptive systematic at which I later learned how to do, uh, as a leader I learned how to recruit people and um,

Speaker 4:          00:22:05       I had a similar situation, college to do, you know me well, there was this Italian class that I was taking, it was just beautiful. Puerto Rican girl, check glasses. She's so hot. Ooh. And she was always asking me to go to these parties. She's always inviting me to these parties, like, come to this, come on, go on to the Cape for the weekend. You should come. And I was like, whoa. Oh my God. But I was always busy. I was so mad. I was like, fuck, I got to find a date where I was busy too. I was a waiter on the weekends. What year is this? I graduated high school in [inaudible] 85. Um, I took a year off before I went to Umass Boston, a wasted three years just fucking around there. That was a, so he was probably 86, 86, even Church of Christ, I don't know what church they were in because they were hot and heavy that period of time, it could be in Boston.

Speaker 4:          00:22:54       They were, they were inviting me to these retreats and they had invited me to more than one and I couldn't go what I was about. I was still competing in martial arts tournaments back then. I was always busy, but I really liked this girl. She's pretty hot and she's very friendly too. I was like, wow, maybe she's the one really friendly, loving, cute severity. This is how it goes down. Um, there was a, an airplane crash in Boston and uh, it was one of those weird plane crashes where the, um, did Trump have an airplane at one time to Donald Trump have an airline? Maybe. I don't know why we're connect him to it and some strange way, but whatever it was, this airline, um, the way the wheels wouldn't come down, you know how sometimes they make those crazy landings where they skid across the one way and the sparks fly and everything like that.

Speaker 4:          00:23:41       So I sat down with these, uh, girls and, um, uh, we're at lunch in the cafeteria and a, I go, did you guys hear about the plane crash? And they go, no, what happened? And I said, yeah, well some, uh, uh, the, the wheels wouldn't, it was Trump airlines. Yeah, that's what it was. I'm pretty sure it was his, you could probably find the actual date that this happened. Finally, actual date that Trump airlines, uh, wheels wouldn't come down. So anyway, it said Logan Airport in Boston, skids parks, the whole might've been Boston, it might've been somewhere else, but I was living in Boston anyway. Boy, am I getting off track these, uh, I, I tell him the whole story then too, by the way. So they go, what happened? And I said, well, the wheels, uh, didn't come down. And, uh, they had a skate across the one way.

Speaker 4:          00:24:25       It was anyone hurt. I go, no, no, no one was hurt. They go, oh, praise God, praise God. And I just went, what? It was just, it was weird. They all clasp their hands together like this. Praise God, pray. It wasn't like, wow, whew, thank God nobody was hurt, you know, which is like a normal expression. But it was, it was a very pious, like a devoutly religious praise God. Oh praise God. And I looked around, I go, pray, okay, what do you guys do? And then, and then I started realizing, fuck man, she didn't really want me to come to a party. Like there's something going on here and save your soul man. Yeah. Well, and then, and then I started asking him, I said to you, you think God like saved that? Oh, absolutely. I go, well, why didn't God just make the wheels come down? Why Freak everybody out? And then quick question. And then, and then it got weird and then it got ugly and then they never talked to me again. I forget where it went. I was a dick back then. I probably said something stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       Well, a lot of Bible Colts, uh, Jewish Christian and Muslim are into Armageddon. You know, the apocalypse is coming any moment. It's a good way to get people to sign up. Exactly. The heavy pressure or scarcity time's running out. If here, if, if the world ended tomorrow, are you ready or are you going to hell for the rest? Doesn't matter if it's ready or not. The world's gonna end, you know, it's like, are you ready to sign over your real estate and your bonds? And so you're sitting at this table, these girls come over. They weren't even students, right? So what are they doing in school? How do they get in? They lied. They just walked in Shane's colleges, city university, shitty security. Probably can't do that. And not only that, but later when I got recruited into the group, I was told to drop out of Queens college from the cult, sent back to Queens College to start a student group on campus to get people into the student groups so they would drop out of Queens. College does adorable. It's very slick. So you're sitting there at this table, you're bummed out, you're broken hearted. What was the girl broke up with you? What was her name? Let's call her Debbie fucking shoe is a shoe model. That's all I remember. Model. She had great legs and I have no recollection of what

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       her name is. Oh, okay. Let's call her Debbie. So Debbie tears your heart apart and uh, just leaves you there at this cafeteria alone. Vulnerable. Poor Steve. You're like, what now what now? I thought she was going to be the one and these gals come over and where are they hot?

Speaker 3:          00:27:01       They were cute and they were very flirtatious. They didn't say, by the way, masturbation is a sin and father's going to line us up with thousands of people in the sign. Who's who you're gonna marry and you have to wait four years to have sex with them. Was that the moonies? Yeah. How they do it? Yeah. They didn't say anything about that. Well, so I, and I said, are you part of some religious group? Oh No, not at all. We just a group of students who are concerned about modern issues.

Speaker 4:          00:27:31       What was their approach to you? They sat down, they started talking to you. What, what, what did they, what are they open up with?

Speaker 3:          00:27:37       Hey, nice classes. Mm, no, I think I had, it was the spring semester. I had a pile of books, I was taking philosophy, psychology, writing a, I think I had to partner shots. I think I had Heidegger's being in time and they were like, why being in time is that thick. Oh Wow. You must be really smart.

Speaker 4:          00:27:58       Uh, what is, what is that about? So they start flattering you serious?

Speaker 3:          00:28:06       Yeah. The call is known and other cults are known as love bombing. You know, Puerto Rican girl did to me too. Damn. She was hot steam. It's all about saving the person's soul and you know, step by step, incremental recruitment, finding out as much as you can about the person saying almost nothing about

Speaker 4:          00:28:28       what you are about and what the group is about. Well unlike you, I wasn't particularly vulnerable at the time, so it was a good time for them to get after me cause I was in the middle of some pretty intense stuff. My lab, I had a goal, I was pretty focused. I wasn't get roped up in some religion, but if they got me a couple of years earlier I think they could have gotten me, I was real vulnerable when I was like 18

Speaker 3:          00:28:54       so the, the reality is as, as human beings we have lifecycle events where were situationally vulnerable, death of a loved one, breakup of a relationship. You know, moving to a new city, state or country illness, there are things that every human being goes through and for me is a overwhelming ignorance of the public to kind of blame the victims. Like you were stupid for believing in this. Like what was wrong with you? You are a week for falling for this as opposed to tell me about your experience and tell me what you know, what happened. You know there's a principle in social psychology called the fundamental attribution error. I know that so a of of syllables but it basically is the single most important principle of social psychology. And when it means is what I was basically saying before, when people try to understand why other people are doing what they do, they over a tribute individual variables and they under attribute social environmental variables,

Speaker 2:          00:30:02       social environment variables are gigantic. I think that's correct. One of the things about a person being older and wiser like that, you always hear the expression older and wiser, but if you really look at it like it mathematically, well what is it? It's data. It's accumulation of data and the understanding of the relationships between events, reactions and consequences. And when you're 18 years old, you don't have a lot of data, you only have a few things that are going on. And for, for me, when I was 18, it was a, the breakup of me and this girl that I was dating and the uh, all of a sudden becoming a man, being responsible, having to go to college or get some sort of a job or some sort of a career and just the, just the overwhelming possibilities of the future and, and not having any clue as to what, how it was all going to play out. I was terrified. And if someone came along with bright, then I feel like they could have got me, I feel like I was real vulnerable around 18. But I met this hot Puerto Rican girl, I think I was about 20. And I was pretty, I was pretty determined at that time, so I was okay, but

Speaker 3:          00:31:09       well not said that there were so many different types of destructive cults. So they're not just all religious cults. There can be a therapy called clinical called can be a cult of personality.

Speaker 2:          00:31:19       That's very important. That's very important because there's a lot of different things that can lock you in and then start to control you and start to suck money off of you and start to really dictate your behavior in a very unhealthy way. And that is so common. There's so many different versions of it. It almost seems to be like a pattern of human behavior and thinking like a, a code that you can kind of crack like a cheat code and people.

Speaker 3:          00:31:48       Hmm. We've experienced a revolution in science and medicine and in psychology and in particular social psychology. There had been so many, you know, pivotal experiments in the last 50 to 100 years that give us windows into understanding our vulnerabilities. So for example, when I'm counseling someone who's involved with a destructive cult, I don't start out by saying, hey, you're on a call, let me liberate you or something. In fact, my whole approach is empowering people to think for themselves. So I asked them questions with respect cause I really want them to think about it. In any case, I showed them the asch conformity study, a Solomon Asch. What does that the, so the Solomon asch conformity study was framed to people coming

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       into it as a visual perception experiment. Basically, they'd be brought into a room with several people in a semicircle and there'll be a person in the front with a card with four lines on it, a sample line, and then three other lines of different sizes. Okay, let's say a three inch sample line, a three inch or four inch and a five inch, but everyone is in on the experiment except the person and seat six. And after going around twice giving the correct answer, everyone confidently starts giving the wrong same answer. And the test is how many people will start to conform to giving the wrong answer, even though they can see what their own eyes, what the correct answer is. And that study's been replicated thousands of times, and the answer is two thirds start giving the wrong answer even though they know intellectually that it's the wrong answer because it feels too uncomfortable to be in the room.

Speaker 1:          00:33:43       And is that the, the, the testimony that they give when they are asked, what did they shoot? Assuming the interview these people absolutely. Yeah, it's uncomfortable. And I even show a dateline and old dateline episode where they asked Anthony Pratt, Kansas is one of the foremost social psychologists to, to actually do the studies so they could film it. And this, they start out with the Asian woman who is the, her role at resistor who gives the correct answer, but she's grimacing as she's giving the wrong answer, even though she knows it's the right answer. But because of the social forces we are, have mirror neurons, we want to fit in to the people in the room. It's just human nature. People survive. Exactly. Clan behave. Exactly. But it's hard wired. So I show that video that, that experiment and I always like to ask people, so tell me a, something you could do if you were in that situation to scientifically reality test that situation.

Speaker 1:          00:34:44       Scientifically Reality Test meaning meaning what? You're in this room, everyone's saying a five inch line is a three in July. And what could you do? Let me ask you, what would you do? Because you have the data now. Okay, you're, you're a cult expert. You would, I'd get up and measure it. Right, but you would obviously understand what's going on. Right? Exactly. But if you asked me prior to my induction into the moonies that I understand the asch conformity study or the power of B, I would have said, no, I'm an individual. I'm a nonconformist. I had the bumper sticker question authority and I had the ponytail and you know the word unique right in you rebel. Totally. So anyway, after the asch conformity study, the Milgram obedience study, Stanley Milgrim did a test at the time, the dominant

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       theory in psychology for explaining how the Nazis good do what they did was called the authoritarians personality. And Milgram's said, I wonder if Americans would do the very same thing. And he developed this ingenious shock box, which really was set of switches. I had no electricity at all, but it sounded electrical. And he basically would bring people and tell them they're doing a scientific experiment that's very important, that tests memory and punishment and learning and set people up into a situation where they thought they were giving an electrical shock to the person, the next room, and it was all tape recorded with, and it would increase 15 volts from mild to moderate to severe to extreme to x, x, x, x, and there'd be a guy in a white lab coat acting very proper who happened to be a high school teacher who was moonlighting a few extra bucks. And the test was how many people would electrocute of fellow human being in an hour because an authority figure told them they had to because they had made a commitment to do a scientific experiment. And the answer was two thirds.

Speaker 1:          00:36:54       Yeah, I saw a regular lab listen to a radio lab podcast on, on that very thing. It's, it's in fact there's a movie that's coming out about it called the experimenter. And the next study that I'm about to mention, the movie just came out a week or two ago called the Stanford prison experiment. The fills for Barnardo. Yeah. Who was one of my mentors trying to get it. I was trying to get him on the podcast, but I was out of the country when he wanted to come on and I was really bummed out. Well, try to get them back.

Speaker 3:          00:37:23       Yeah. I'm going to fly in this amazing, he taught a course at Stanford called the psychology of mind control for 15 years and use two chapters of my original book in it. Um, and he was also president of the American psychological association, but he, so in his experiment he randomly divided guys and to guards and prisoners and he did basically controlled behavior, information, thoughts and emotions. And people started having nervous breakdowns and some of the guards started becoming sadistic. And instead of saying, you know what, I don't want to do the experiment anymore. They had gotten so sucked into the experience that they, that they're only out was to have a nervous breakdown. Wow. It was extraordinary. So when I'm helping people understand what happens in the Scientology called the Mooney called the TM cult, or any number of other destructive cults, I want them to,

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       what's a TM called? Transcendental meditation. That's a cult. Oh yeah. Really big time. I thought that was just like a method of like cleansing your mind. I didn't know that there was even a coat behind. Oh, my Rishi. She yogi. Oh yeah. This is not,

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       I'm a, people practice it. They practice techniques of transcendental meditation alone by themselves. So they in a cult.

Speaker 3:          00:38:43       So, uh, the answer is you don't need to be in a room with other people to be in a mind control cult, but it can get inside your head and create a new cult identity that suppresses your real identity and it's not healthy.

Speaker 2:          00:39:00       Well, I have a very cursory understanding of transcendental medication meditation. So if you could please tell me what exactly does that mean? So

Speaker 3:          00:39:08       cool. Um, and I have the story of a woman who was raised in TM in chapter six of the new book, Gina Catania. So, first of all, there's a thousand or more ways to meditate and there's not one way that everyone has to meditate. In fact, neurologically, it's very detrimental for people to do, for some people to do a mantra meditation where they're repeating it over and over, it actually increases anxiety.

Speaker 2:          00:39:36       Really saw like Buddhist meditations where they, oh, so breath meditation. The point is, is that it's a tool

Speaker 3:          00:39:46       for training consciousness. And ultimately, depending on your level of training, you want to not be a victim of your thoughts or your feelings. You want to not only develop a perspective and a wisdom, uh, consciousness. You want to also get out of the entire frame of self dialogue and just, and total being this. But any group that says you have to do it our way or else, or if you're having bad reactions, they say, that's good. You're unstressing keep doing it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:40:18       Is that what trends, denim meditation? I'm afraid so. Well, when you say bad reactions, how so? Let's Hicks, headaches,

Speaker 3:          00:40:26       um, barking like a dog. I've heard from some, uh, Jamie, who would that instating. Um, there person go wrote a book about TM and some of the net negative after effects. Um, and what you need to understand about a destructive cult is that that there are many levels. If you're just doing a meditation and you're not doing the advanced than the next advanced and then becoming sell a bit and then,

Speaker 2:          00:40:55       oh, that's all in transcendental meditation

Speaker 3:          00:40:57       goes. And Maharishi was saying if we didn't, if they didn't have 40,000 cities, which meant people hopping around thinking they were levitating, that's hilarious. The world would blow up. So he was using the whole fear trip thing to me, raise a lot of money to get people to be these devotions.

Speaker 2:          00:41:17       Yeah. This yogi flying. It's is that, first of all, how dare you? How dare you, this man, these people are flying and you're claiming bs. You're very rare hopping on mattresses today and they take a picture, they're on the up, see, they're flying. We've got the proof. Someone is just like, you're poopooing magic. Have you ever seen Jamie? Have you seen it? Have you seen Yogi flying? It's adorable. It's hilarious. He's full. So I want to plug a documentary. This here it goes. Yeah, look at this. I mean, no effort at all, right? Phil Donahue actually edited a show on this and it filled, put his legs in Lotus and hopped. Well, what's really funny is, wow, I made amazing the Phil can put his legs in Lotus, but what's amazing is back when this guy is getting tired, so his is hops. Let's go back to the beginning.

Speaker 2:          00:42:08       Jamie. His hops in the beginning were much higher because he was fresh. Celia, that kid's getting some air. Now let's go a little bit further. Jamie, look, good luck. See right there. He's getting tired. I'm a fight commentator. I understand what people are fatiguing. It's guys getting lactic acid flying. It's but my hurry. She said, you know, this raises the energy level of the planet earth so that there were fewer automobile accident and less war. I feel for all these people. I really do. I feel for that guy right there with the classes in front of this cat because he's fucked. All these people, they're fucked. It's like social anxiety, lack of friends, and a lack of community and there's so many different things that can lead someone to, to want to seek comfort in these, these ideologies. And he's, or they could have been born into it or they could have been deceptively recruited by a hot chick back to that guy.

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       But the the thing is, is emotions. If you're having doubts or if you're having bad feelings, they're like, it's telling you to like look at what's happening and maybe you need to make a change. But if you're in the TM movement and you're having bad feelings about the group, you're told that, that you need to meditate to get rid of that. And that's known as thought stopping. That's one of the, the techniques and the t of the bite and model to shut down any reality testing in the moonies. We were taught to chance crush Satan crush seat and crush Satan Rush, Satan. It has a piece on her. Gloria haven't of, I want to tell you a true story. Joe Rogan, but not be about Satan. It is.

Speaker 2:          00:44:01       So I'm raised in a Jewish family. We don't believe in Satan. Okay. At all. You believe in God and the Jewish family. Yeah. We'll wait a minute. Hold on. If you believe in God, then you have to believe in the god of the Bible. Is that what you're defining goddess? Now you're asking me to define what I was believing as a child. As a conservative Jew? Yes. I guess so. The God of the Bible. Isn't Satan in the Bible as well? No. No. Satan is not in the Bible. No, not in the, not in the toe run now. Oh well that's a Torah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       That the new testament was a invention later. Of course. Yeah. Constantine. How many bishops, right? Didn't he put it? 380? I believe it was. Yeah. So, um, here's the story. So I'm in the Frickin Mooney's if I may curse cause I've watched, I don't think it was, is not a curse. Okay, good. I don't think you said a curse. Uh, the exorcist movie comes out. Oh, buses, 300 members, including myself into Greenwich village to watch the exorcist hard watched the movie. We all get in our vans. Go to Terry town to the palatial estate, and they have a palatial estate they had. They had multiple ones. This one particular one, a Terry town is where I got a lot of my indoctrination. It used to be owned by the Seagram's family. Moon gets up and he says, God, the exorcist, this movie is a prophecy of what will happen if people leave the unification church.

Speaker 1:          00:45:36       Okay? Now, before we, before he gave that speech, we were singing holy songs for three hours. That's after watching this crazy excersice movie. And, and I only remembered the exorcist movie for years after I got out of the cult. And I was studying psychology and we were learning about phobias. And I was thinking back, well, so what was, how was I installed with phobias? And then I remembered this movie and this lecture and it's like, holy crap, I believed it. Hundred Percent Satan was everywhere. And only by being in God's holy family. Yep, that's it. And the head zips around and levitates movie. It's scared suck though in any way. So how can an intelligent person from an intact family who is going to be a professional writer and be a college professor and get sucked into a cult that wants to take over the world, make an automatic theocracy, abolish, say tannic democracy, uh, kill everyone that doesn't believe it was literally what we were pretty much told by moon that, you know, we needed to reclaim the earth for God, not unlike Isis and a few other cults out there.

Speaker 1:          00:47:07       Um, I was told the Holocaust was necessary because the Jews didn't accept Jesus. Well, I had been educated about the Holocaust I'd been and what, I didn't mention Israel to the Holocaust museum. When you heard that, what was your reaction? I had been so, so mine in the extreme cult example is a dissociative disorder. I'm speaking as a mental health professional and Steve has since on a Milton and Estelle Hassan from flushing, Queens became Steve Hassan, son of some young moon and hock Jaha and the true parents of the universe. And he needed to be a clone of moon and he was evil. And my whole time in the group was suppressing who I was. It totally shutting down any element of me. I was sleeping three to four hours a night. I was working seven days a week for no pay. I was recruiting people, I was indoctrinating people, I was doing political events, Ramon, including fasting for Nixon during the Watergate, fasting for Nixon, fasting for Nixon because God wanted him to be present.

Speaker 1:          00:48:23       That's how you know you're in the wrong color. So I'll tell you a quick funny story. So my father voted for Nixon. I voted for McGovern and we would, my father was a business owner. He thought Nixon was good. I said, daddy's a cruck. How could you vote for him? It's pathetic. I'm in the cult. I call him up. I say, dad were fasting for Nixon, were in the capital, and he says, Steven, you are right. He's a crook. I said, dad, you don't understand. God wants Nixon to be president. He said, now I know you're brainwashed. He's a crook. I said, dad, you just don't understand. And how old were you at the time? And this was when he was 19. 20. Yeah. So I want to take it back to the cafeteria if you don't mind. So you sitting in this cafeteria, these girls come up to you, they start flattering you.

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       They, they, they're flirting with you. Um, and then what's the next step? So they're part of an international group of students who are trying to make the world a better place that happened to have a house, kind of like a commune, which was kind of interesting. What I like to come over for dinner. So it was the free dinner. Would they cook? I have no recollection. And, and it's interesting because back then I was feeding them all the information about myself, how I thought, what my values were, what my interests were. So I was telling them how to manipulate me. You say in this day and age you can go on the Internet and read people's Facebooks and all of their posts and you don't even need to ask them. You say this. Right? But, um, I'm assuming the girls you're talking about are not much older than you, right?

Speaker 1:          00:50:08       So how would warrant them being manipulated themselves? Weren't they as essentially a part of this whole thing? And in that they were really victims along the same way. They were making you a victim. Like they were bitten by the vampire from victimizer model and they're called identity is, we're suppressing. They were sent away from Japan, from their family and friends, and they were Japanese chess. They were Japanese checks. Right, right. That's what's up. So, but here again, um, but they were, we knew that they would have to report each other if anyone deviated. So that's why they would not send people out individually, like this tattle tale system. But, but my point being is if they were not much older than you, if at all, and they were also victims of the same ideology, call it whatever you want to call it, the why would they be looking to manipulate you?

Speaker 1:          00:51:02       Oh, wouldn't it be a part of it? So members were taught to believe as they still are, right. And enlarge that the world is headlong into an Armageddon situation of any moment. Judgment Day is happening. And as much as you can to bring people into God and save their soul. Saving a person in the moonies meant saving 10 generations of their father's ancestors that are in the spirit world and their mothers and sisters and less feral world. And they're all looking at you all the time hoping you're going to make good decisions because if you do good things for God, you're going to make good vitality elements that will feed them in the spirit world. And it got, I mean, every culture has its own convoluted yet internally a totalistic system. So, but unlike Scientology, the Mooneys or like save others, Scientology is like, you know, become a god and control everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       Control matter, energy, space and time and, but we'll get people to do it. You want them to do. Right. But my point was that they, these people were also manipulated, so they knew that they were manipulating you, but they didn't think that they are being manipulated themselves. But at the same call, I think they were trying to find information. When you're at fault Joe, you're not having that reflection of, right. You know, of course server looking back and going, hey, what just happened just then is no medic commenting. It's like your program to think the right way, feel the right way, act the right way. And um, you're self censoring. And in my particular case, I guess because I'm somewhat competitive on some level, I know you have enough no relationship to understanding what it feels like to be competitive. Uh, I wanted to be the best Mooney I could be chosen by moon and one of his right hand people to be the model leader in America. So I was hand groomed to help take over America and the world for two years. So this had to be a very quick transition from you, Steve Hassan, normal college student to boom full on fasting for Nixon. Yeah. I didn't mean it was very

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       fast. It was about two weeks after my first contact to me, uh, having what I thought was a spiritual experience and believing that I was being directed by God to this organization. Wow. Yeah. So this madness attribution happens a lot. Now for some of my clients that literally at a vulnerable point in their life, maybe their religious in there praying, Dear God tells me what to do. You know, should I leave my marriage? But you know, what should I do? And the next thing they know the doorbell is ringing and it's a Jehovah's Witnesses who want to study the Bible and they're like, miss attributing, thinking God just rang the doorbell as opposed to these people are going ringing every single doorbell within a six block.

Speaker 2:          00:54:15       Great. Of course it's like my friend Gary, he hits on every girl he meets his ideas that if you swing enough pitches [inaudible] you never know you're going to it. It's like he'll, he's, he had some girls way hotter than him, just way above his head and it never works out. But he's like, you just got to keep swinging. He didn't have her know. I'm always hopeful. Yup. So that's what they're dealing with and winging it. Every pitch. Essentially they're, they're knocking on every door and every now and then they get that one ball that's in the strike zone. And that Steve Hassan sitting there. What does pile of books? Well, in my case, so I went to this three day workshop. I didn't want to stay, I was a waiter on the weekends. I was busy. I can't go on

Speaker 3:          00:54:57       on a weekend and they just kept saying, it's going to be so great and Dah, Dah, Dah. I didn't even know it was a workshop. And after two years of working at the Holiday Inn in Hempstead as a banquet waiter on the weekends, I call up to find out when I'm supposed to report it and he says, Steve, you won't believe it, but the wedding was canceled. So take the weekend off, man. I had just had this, these women working on me all week. And I was like, well, maybe I'm too, well, I did give them my word because, but I gave him my word thinking f is never going to have a weekend off. And then I was kind of like, well, maybe I'm meant to go. I should do this. So I say, I'm okay. I'm free for the weekend. Let's go. And we're driving up. It's a middle of the winter through this palatial estate.

Speaker 3:          00:55:47       And they say, by the way, this weekend we're having a joint workshop with the Unification Church. And I said, what church? Nobody said anything about church and workshop. Nobody said anything about a workshop. What's up with that? And they did the typical, turn it around on you. Technique of Steve, what's, do you have issues with Christians to do? You uh, uh, you biased against Christians? And all of a sudden, now I'm on the defensive, but there were no cell phones back then in 1974, uh, it's a middle of the night. I have an option of getting out in the snow and trying to hitchhike. I'm like, what am I, well, just wait for the morning. Just stay here and we'll drive you back in the morning. And they slid around your bed like sirens while I was in a room where I wasn't sleeping. Yeah. So you've learned a little hypnosis. The Joe, uh, in any case, the morning comes, the van is laughed.

Speaker 3:          00:56:53       Now what? Um, you know, and I fucked, well let's just go in and, and see what you think. And it was all orchestrated cause I later learned how to orchestrate it and how many people were in there with you that were also new recruits. So that was another trick, a little bit of a scam because they had people there that were acting like they were newcomers but they weren't creating small groups where there's the illusion of, so essentially a lot like the study where they have the one those alerts and it's not in on the study. There was, it was very systematic. Wow. And it get so good at that with this Mooney character. How did he create all this? So we want the, the long shorts, the shorts, real answer.

Speaker 3:          00:57:42       Okay. A background in science and psychology or something. Sure. I'm all so moon himself was apparently in a cult and North Korea. And it turns out that most cult leaders were in a cult themselves. So they didn't learn the techniques out of thin air. But the interesting thing about my former cult was that the CIA set up the Korean CIA because that had been two coups in South Korea to that point. And they were very worried about North Korean brainwashing and they thought, you know, we need to do something to stabilize South Korea. So they had this brilliant idea of creating a private group that would help to reeducate political dissonance. It's called victory over communism. And I only know about this because there was a Korea Gate investigation from 76 to 78, um, where the founder of the Korean ca was interviewed and he said, he quote, organized and utilize the Unification Church for use as a political tool unquote. Wow. And this was at the point where Americans were getting fed up with Vietnam wanting us to withdraw. The hawks were very worried about and like needing a stronger stance against communism. So they thought, oh yeah, we need to have student groups on campus saying we need to have a military response to communists. We should be in Vietnam. And the moonies we use for that too later. I was part of the fasting for Nixon thing. There was a whole political,

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       very shady piece here. So you go from this, you get out. How did you get out? How'd you figure out that? It was all bad. I was rescued by my family essentially. Uh, they didn't know where I was for a year. Uh, I drove into the back of a tractor trailer truck on the Baltimore Beltway at 80 miles an hour in intro and basically nearly died. Broke my leg really badly, fall asleep on the wheel or something. Fell asleep three days, no sleep and two weeks in the hospital sleeping, eating away from the group. I missed my sister Thea, who was the only person in my previous life that didn't say I was in a cult or brainwashed. She was always just like, I love you and I don't understand, this doesn't seem like you Steve. I reached out to her not because I wanted to leave but cause I missed her and she was like, you have two nephews.

Speaker 1:          01:00:20       I want them to know they were uncle Steve Come and visit. And I'm like, if you promise not to tell the parents, I can arrange it because I'm a leader and she promised. And fortunately she broke her promise and she told my parents and they hired some x members and they did a deprogramming intervention with me. Ex members of the moonies. Yeah. Wow. So your parents went deep with this. They knew what they were dealing with. They put everything on the table because they knew they could have gone to jail too if it didn't work. One of the, one of the team was a woman I had recruited, could have gotten the jail. Yeah. Why? Because it's illegal to abduct and adult. In my case, I just took my crutches away. I had a cast from my toes to my groin abduction. Correct. But uh, at the point that I said I want to leave and they wouldn't let me leave, I could have been something about false imprisonment.

Speaker 1:          01:01:15       But the long and the short of it is, is I was so confident that what I was doing was correct and that I wasn't brainwashed and at a critical juncture where we were, they were moving locations cause the cult was coming after me to rescue me. My father's weeped, she just started crying and said, what would you do if it was your son who quit? You dropped out of school, quit his job and during his bank account and got involved with a controversial group, how would you feel? And he was crying and I never saw my father cry and it just touched the real me and I could, I build my cult self thought he was brainwashed by the communist media against spot there. But the real me was like, dad really loves me and I want to prove to him that I'm not brainwashed. So I said, what do you want me to do? He said, I just want you to talk with them for another four days. Like having an open mind and if you want to go back, at least your mother and I will be able to sleep at night. Knowing we did the responsible thing and I agreed and I had this days

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       where they were teaching me about thought reform in the psychology of totalism, which was a book by Robert J lift and about Chinese Communist brainwashing of the fifties I had all of these experiences that we're starting to surface that had been suppressed at during my leadership.

Speaker 2:          01:02:37       It's the same mechanism that allows people to be inspired, the same mechanism that allows people to be manipulated. You know that man mechanism being you see something that's, there's something about it that makes you excited, like, like a, a great performance, a great concert or an athletic performance we get out of, they just feel inspired. A great book that inspires you at manipulates your, your brainwaves, manipulates your consciousness and it steers you in a certain direction is that same sort of mechanism that allows people to be influenced by others. What allows people to be manipulated by others in this form where you can actually literally change the way they think and view the world. That's a big piece of it. Is it sort of a law in the, the beautiful thing about inspiration? Is it a flaw in that? Because inspiration is beautiful. It's fuel, right?

Speaker 3:          01:03:27       Well, I think you need to have the analytic part of your mind, right? And a, and a consciousness that just because it sounds great and looks great, doesn't mean that it isn't

Speaker 2:          01:03:37       great. But you know what I'm saying? Like, you know how sometimes things happen and you're just carried away by them. Like you go see a movie and you're like, God damn, I just want to go do something. I just feel so good. He's just like, he got you. You know? Do you ever, do you see Braveheart? I have. I saw brave heart man for like two hours. I wanted a sword fight. After that movie was over, I wanted to join. I'm like fruit. Um, you know, it's like there's, there's those mine grow up

Speaker 3:          01:04:01       with watching combat on TV and just, you know, and I not see and yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:04:08       I really wanted to fight. What I'm trying to get at is there's, when you see things and when information and data gets into your mind, it influences you in this very strange way that can be positive and it can be inspirational. Like whether it's seeing Michael Jordan put on an incredible formats or Rhonda Rousey, you know, beating someone or you know, those, those moments where someone does something truly great, it's fuel. For you, its fuel. Is that the same sort of mechanism that they kind of tap into to change your mind?

Speaker 3:          01:04:38       Definitely. It's, it's a piece of the emotional and the brain stimulation.

Speaker 2:          01:04:43       So it's like the hack your mind. It's kind of like hacking.

Speaker 3:          01:04:46       I talk about in the book the via like a virus that gets in and corrupts your operating system. You still have your original one, but the, now this malware has been inserted and now you're working, you think that it's you, but I thought it was Steve, just the true Steve and that the old Steve was the fall and Steve. But stepping back and getting perspective and seeing the patterns of mind control and manipulation in other groups. And then reflecting

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       back on your own experience is the one of the basic tenants of what I do in my, in my work, helping family members to rescue loved ones are helping people who are either born in a cult or recruited into a call. So in a sense that this, this experience that you had when you were 19 was incredibly beneficial for your career. Ah, yeah. Um, I have mixed emotions when I hear you say that, cause I didn't, I don't want to do this work to be completely honest. Really, really, really. You don't want it because you don't want it to be work that it would be done. It's traumatic. It's helping people who are suffering, but don't you get a benefit out of that? I get, I get a fulfillment that I'm doing something really helpful to individuals. I'm trying to help people around the world to understand this phenomenon.

Speaker 1:          01:06:13       I'm trying to counter some of the major forces against totalitarianism, but to suggest that, you know, wow, you know, you have the moonies to thank for Korea. Oh, I'm saying it's beneficial for you having a negative experience. You don't have anyone. So it's, it's, it's a wounded healer model. Yes, yes, yes. It definitely deepened to me in a way that I could not have been deep before because when you wake up from being in a group like this, the shame, the embarrassment, that confusion, I felt like I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what was real. I literally had to have my family and my friends show me videos of who I was before to remind me, wow, what I needed to go to places that I used to go to. Like I had a belief, and this is very common and I want to touch on Stefan Molyneux, uh, which is how I learned about you seeing your interview with him.

Speaker 1:          01:07:13       But, um, I believed I had an abused childhood. It was part of how they conditioned this new cult identity, suppress my old identity as they poisoned me against my past and what coded everything. So what did they tell you happened about your childhood? It wasn't that someone stood over me and told me, but it was, it was part of the whole indoctrination system, listening to other people, talking about abuses in their families, et cetera. But I literally, when I first got out of the group, I thought I was miserable, depressed, that my father was physically abusive. And when I said to my sister while dad was physically abusive, she went, what? You really thought it? Yes. Wow. Yes. But what you have an actual image in your mind of your father doing it. So one real memory that everything else was built off of. And it was an actual event that happened.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       I think I was 11 or 12. My father wanted to know where the change was for lunch and I had bought baseball cards or something and I lied and my father slapped my face. That was the one true. And that was the one time my father had me. Um, but I really believed it and my sisters were like, dad never hit us because his father beat the crap out of him. He never, you know, that that's issue wasn't, you didn't want to hug us or hold us, but that was not physically abusive.

Speaker 2:          01:08:47       So just one moment where he lost his patient. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:08:52       Formed false memories based on that. Right. And what what Scientology does is they have you go back and, and, and remember abuse from the past, but then once you're done remembering whatever, then you go into your past lives to remember all the

Speaker 2:          01:09:07       abuse. That's where it's really, and it keeps going on and on, don't they? When they're doing that and that auditing process, aren't they trying to get you to let it go? Like isn't the idea that you, you were repeat a traumatic event so many times that it means nothing to like, like if you've ever been around someone who doesn't swear, like you're your grandma or something like that and she says, fuck you. Like Whoa, what the hell? Like your grandma doesn't swear, but if you're around one like Jamie, this kid's got a total potty mouth. It just comes flying out of him. You know what I mean? Like if you're around certain people, they swear all the time, it seems normal. And in the word lose its meaning. It just becomes a part of the normal vernacular. But if you're around someone and it's very, very, very rare, it becomes like this, this big moment. Well, the idea being that you repeat this thing, this event over and over and over and over again, so it loses its meaning, it loses its impact.

Speaker 3:          01:09:56       So is that what they do? So that there's a qualitative difference? We'll change the sensitization around a word or something. And actually trauma processing harbored was using a very old model of Catharsis that you have to remember the abuse and you have to reexperience the abuse over and over and over again. And that's been thrown out by the mental health profession decades ago. Why? Because you're, you're revictimizing people having them suffer the experience over and over and over again. If I want to help someone who's been abused, I tell them, you have to be in your body in the here and now, and you have, uh, a window or a TV screen seeing the younger you, but you're safe. You're here. The abuse happened over there and I don't want them to have associated memories of abuse. I want them to know that they're safe, that that did happen. But it's not, it's, it's just incorrect to think the, the brain and the emotions are battery and all you need to do is drain it and then it's gone. It's just not,

Speaker 2:          01:11:05       isn't a, but it doesn't work. These theories about how to approach a various past traumas, traumatic incidents, these theories are a, essentially a variable, right? Like what work work with one person might not necessarily work with another person. And a lot of these ideas that you put into practice, I mean, don't they? I mean, aren't there flexible?

Speaker 3:          01:11:27       There have been therapy colts. We were open this up by talking about different types of cults and if any ideology that's black and white in that you're trying to compress human experience into the ideology is worrisome because no one model is, is true. Everyone's different, everyone's different. But the, the goal as a therapist is do no harm and empower the person to be functional, right? It's the goal isn't to trauma process. So in the last few years I've been trained in a form of attachment therapy where we're people, people who have personality disorders, which were hitherto, um, believe to be like permanent can actually be cured in two to three years. And the technique is basically using hypnotherapy technique where you're asking the person to go back to a key traumatic moment in their childhood and imagining asking them to imagine if they had the ideal mother or the IDL father that was uniquely suited to them and they did exactly what you wanted them to do in that situation and ask their imagination to fill in the scene.

Speaker 3:          01:12:46       You do it, you, you, the person literally can create a positive reference point of safety, of security, of love, of a tea, of connection, all the things that children need to experience to have a sense of how a healthy sense of self and people know that they were abused, but they're repairenting to use another term there internally using their imagination, their repairenting themselves. And what we is now proven neuroscientifically is there's, there's, um, neurogenesis and neuroplasticity to the point where people can know that they were abused, remember it, but they can act as if they had that healthy mother and their healthy father and a healthy childhood.

Speaker 5:          01:13:37       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:13:38       And be functional. It doesn't not seem to know it works. It works. It works.

Speaker 2:          01:13:44       Act as if they believe, I mean this sounds like fantasy. Am I reading it wrong?

Speaker 3:          01:13:49       MMM. So, well, it's interesting for me to hear you frame it like that. People are not coming out of a therapy like that thinking that they had a great childhood. Right. But they're no longer walking around, bleeding all over the place. Afraid to trust somebody. Uh, having self

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       doubt, unable to touch and have sexual contact. That's, that's, that feels good because they've created these reference experiential states from themselves. Now these reference experiential states that they create these, these theories and these practices of therapy that someone has to invent these. Like someone has to look at the problems, you have to figure out what's the best way to approach these things and come up with an idea and hope that it works. And as you said, there's like the l Ron Hubbard methods that he was using that he, that were really ancient, those they thought that was going to work and it didn't work.

Speaker 1:          01:14:50       Yeah. And he was never a medical health professional, but he was arrested for practicing medicine without a license. And they did call it a religion to try to

Speaker 2:          01:14:59       right in the birthday. But this, these, these ideas, they're, they're essentially, people come up with ideas of how to treat people that have various elements, right. They, they, they, and they, and then they apply them to people. I mean, how do they practice this stuff? I mean, this is not like something like, hmm, I need to figure out how to chop this tree down. Oh, I'm going to try to invent an acts like in, in what I'm saying. In my case,

Speaker 1:          01:15:22       I was out of the cult for four years when I first, um, um, so a, a formal hypnotist do a trance on somebody. And my reaction was I used to do that when I was doing lectures. Like I had no awareness that I had been taught to do hypnotic methods. I was told to model the older brothers and it was kind of a behavioral modeling kind of thing. And I started wanting to learn hypnosis. I wanted to understand what it was, what it was and how to do it ethically. And essentially there has been a lot of trial and error and a lot of people have gotten hurt by the misuse of it. But if you're in a professional organization with as a strict code of ethics where there are clear boundaries and people can trust that you're there just to help them and they have, it's not about keeping you as a, as a, as a client forever. It's like the faster you can get out of treatment and just live your life, the happier the therapist is. And the more you can teach the person about how, how to know themselves and how to control their feelings or control their thoughts, et cetera. The better what is happening right now in Europe because the socialized medicine is, they really are testing a lot of these approaches and demonstrating that people, for example, with narcissistic personality disorder actually get cured after two to three years.

Speaker 2:          01:17:05       But coming back to my work, when I was, when I was first doing

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       this work and I was uh, uh, struck by people who is saying, but you are recruited at 19, you had an identity before I was born into the group. I don't have a pre called self. What do I do? I didn't know what to say to them other than make one up. Right, and they started doing that now 39 years later. It's actually a treatment modality and I'm not, I'm not taking credit for it. I'm just saying

Speaker 2:          01:17:37       a successful, happy, positive childhood free of this ridiculous confining ideal. It's like if, if you're, if you're

Speaker 3:          01:17:47       real life is this story line you're making, he's making some create an alternate one spaces fingers as a as a default where instead of a parent beating beating you when you're asking for help or saying you're being a sissy, but you have someone saying, tell me what's wrong, let you know you need a hug, and they're visualizing that and feeling like there's someone who's really there for them. That's an anchor. That's a good role model for them. It really can enable them at the point that they're parenting their children to not just reenact the, the, the, the modeling that they learned and beat the crap out of their kid but actually behave like a healthy person would.

Speaker 2:          01:18:38       [inaudible] it seems to me that it's beautiful that all these theories are being developed and tested and applied its beauty, but it seems to me like it's all a work in progress. Is that an incorrect, like it's not like there's any hard fast method for definitely curing people of weird psychological ailments are caught like thinking. I,

Speaker 3:          01:18:56       I think where I think the human species is evolving, I think we're very at a very low level of evolution in terms of our understanding of things. However, um, people are able to get out of the most horrendous abusive childhoods and be functional and not just commit suicide or be drug addicts would be psychotic and a mental ward, but they're able to function and in what we're learning about the brain is, is, is just wonderful. I'm excited about the future in terms of that. That said, there's a huge potential for abuse.

Speaker 2:          01:19:35       Now you technique by you saying that you don't like doing it and it's just, is it just because it's too taxing on you? It's, or is it because you really wish that this wasn't something that you really needed to do? Correct, right. Yeah, I mean, we can all sort of empathize with that. I mean, of course anybody who has children will look at, uh, you love your children. You look at people who were abused as children are abused by, especially by their parents. And it's just this unbelievably painful thing to, to here in, forget about witness or be a part of, but to hear about someone being beaten by their parents or f, you know, abused in some sort of a way. I had my friend Barry Crimmins on the podcast yesterday, a great standup comedian from Boston, and he has a new movie that's out today.

Speaker 2:          01:20:21       It's called call me lucky that, uh, Bob Goldthwait directed and it's about his, uh, he was raped when he was four by his babysitters boyfriend. They would, you know, multiple times. And this is horrible, horrible, horrible, traumatic story and a big part of his life as his, his perseverance and overcoming this thing that happened to him when he's four. He's 62 years old now. Right. You know what I mean? This, this trauma has sort of like defined him in some ways and strengthened him. And other ways that he, his, his ability to overcome it, showing his perseverance but fuck

Speaker 1:          01:20:58       right. And, and often people who have been suffering a trauma like that, if they become comedians, they're compensating to try and balance the pain

Speaker 2:          01:21:10       and maybe call it members. Right. Because that would be someone who'd be vulnerable for someone who, you know, would have some reaching for a utopian view of the world or some, some better way. Cause you know, the horror of the abuse.

Speaker 1:          01:21:26       Yeah. So a lot truth is, is that the, the, the bigger cults don't want people who are seriously emotionally disturbed because they can't control them. If they're serious, seriously disturbed. They don't want them. You want your money, but they don't want you on staff and they don't want to to be part of the PR. So did the, Oh, okay. So do they have like hierarchies like say a funeral, Lee. So have you joined Scientology or something like that? Here's your book. I'll show you that if you, uh, if you go to Scientology and they did give you one of those personality tests, which I took by the way, it's hilarious. They make you hold on these Folgers coffee cans. And this is the pyramid, right? So if you're in the CR gear in the upper quadrant of the pyramid, the leader Tom Cruise, you're in the fringe.

Speaker 1:          01:22:16       He's a friend. She's not a leader. I think he's a leader. I think you're wrong. I think you got a metal dude. He did gold metal. Yeah. But he's, he's not staff. He's more like a symbol and it gives tons of money and he's good for recruiting, but he's not running the group. What do you think's going on with that? You think he's gay? Uh, uh, I've yet to hear an argument against it by, I would say John Travolta. Apparently it's by John's gay and he's buy toms by. Uh, that's my impression. But I have not heard from any farmer Scientologists through just accept being gay. Would Scientology go away immediately? Well, that's homophobic. It's totally homophobic. Moonies oh yeah. It's a degraded human being. If you're gay. In fact, cupboard San Quintin was gay and he killed himself all his murder.

Speaker 2:          01:23:12       So when you saw going clear, were you happy that, um, uh, I'm, I'm in the middle of the book right now. It's God damn amazing. It's amazing when you go over l Ron Hubbard pass and how absolutely ridiculous it was, how many times he lied about things, all the nonsense. And he said, and all the different times he was caught lying and all the different people in his life that he would just make up crazy stories about being this world war two hero was God. He was blind and he's completely crazy. Completely crazy. It's amazing that a guy that's that damaged could get that many people to buy his nonsense. And it is.

Speaker 1:          01:23:52       So, um, Larry, right? And Hbo did a documentary based on that. Yes, Larry, right? Janet, right man, they all took their material from my friend John a tech who was a former member OT five who wrote a book called a piece of blue sky and John and put together this, this, uh, conference in Toronto called getting clear. The website's getting clear.co and we debunked not only Hubbard, but the entire policies inside the organization. I was explaining mind control and it's going to be made live on, on the Internet that people can watch while this, the reason that he did this and why I encouraged him to do this was people were leaving David Miscavige's Church of Scientology but starting their own splinter group of Scientology where they were still idolizing Hubbard and still doing the tech and we wanted it to bunk the whole thing from start to finish. And I think it was done very masterfully. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:24:55       So they were starting like subgroups where they came up with their own stuff. They would do it. They were taking, they were on

Speaker 1:          01:25:02       well automatic pilot of all these [inaudible] closer up to your face. Yeah, I, yeah, sorry about that. No worries. Um, so for example, the number two man, number three, man, Marty Rathbun and Mike Rinder had left the group and we're spelling all the secrets of what, you know, all the criminal activities that were being done. They were creating independence Scientologists and trying to keep doing auditing and keep doing the processing. And it's like, dude, come on, like wake up. The whole system was warped and weird and like,

Speaker 2:          01:25:39       so they were trying, were they trying to like find some beneficial aspects of what they had based most of their life on? Is that what it was? Were trying to salvage some of it right,

Speaker 1:          01:25:47       but like there, if to use the cult identity thing, they're called identity was trying to re, you know, Redo things

Speaker 2:          01:25:54       that Miscavige guys a trip. [inaudible] listen to him talk and those conversations and especially that giant speech that he gave, you know when they got tax

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       free status, like wow, that was a really good book by Tony Ortega who has the blog. If anyone listening wants to know about Scientology, it's Tony or take it out. Or he wrote a book called the unbreakable miss, lovely about Paulette Cooper, who was a friend of mine when I left the moonies in 1976 she wrote a book called the scandal of Scientology. And the book is all about her life story and how this group harassed the hell out of her Scientology. Yes. Because she told the truth about Hubbard and and the organization, and Hubbard said, never defend, always attack, and they did all these criminal activities systematically, which still goes on to this day.

Speaker 1:          01:26:49       So wait, I'm having a book release party after this and you're invited if you want to meet some of the people in the going clear handle it. I, I'm too busy today. No worries. You're doing something at the sea bound theater. Yes. Tomorrow night, the Steve Allen Theater on Steve Allen, by the way, son was in a cult for 11 years and I, he was a big supporter. I watched you on the Steve Allen show. That was one of the first things I saw of you. He was a substitute hosts on CNN back in [inaudible] 88 when the book first came out and he gave me a big plug and I loved, I love him for it and how I get to be at the theater named after him talking about the book again. But the new edition and these days I'm particularly focused on helping victims of pimps and traffickers, pimps and traffickers, sort of a form of a cult in some ways is a commercial cult.

Speaker 1:          01:27:46       They, they do all the bite model, the behavior control, information, control, thought, control, emotional control, make people over and to a new identity and they are dependent and obedient. And I've code developed a curriculum to help survivors to you in the game to get to stand because that's what pimps call what they do the game. So to basically understand that they don't love the women in their stable, that their products and for exploitation. And the only way to win the game is to end it and get out and have a life. It's fascinating that you equate those cause it makes sense. But I've never done it before. I've never put it in my head and thought of a pimp and a prostitute being like the pimp runs a cult. So, um, if you read some of the manuals online by pimps, how to brainwash the hose there terminology for women.

Speaker 1:          01:28:42       I actually tell the story in chapter six of Rachel Thomas, who was recruited while she was in junior at Emory college. She's a beautiful black woman and she was recruited by a pimp who basically said, you're beautiful. You should be a model. I want to take your picture, put you in some rap music videos, which he did. And then he started beating her up and, and, and farming her out for sex and threatening to kill her family if she told anybody. Fortunately she turns to the FBI, he's in jail, she's doing a project to help young girls. And we've codevelop this cause she read my book, she said that this really helps me to understand how

Speaker 2:          01:29:25       he did it to me. Have you ever seen those documentaries, like pimps up hoes down or Americans? Yes. Yeah, that's a big part of it. As they would talk about how they would find people that came from broken homes or they've had daddy issues and they would foster this feeling of family.

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       Right, right. Well, and the, the, the, the cult that I was most experienced with helping victims of was a cult called the children of God. Uh, which the leader was Moses, David Berg, and he was a pedophile and he had to leave the u s cause he was gonna be arrested. And he in his, in his culty had women be happy hookers for Jesus. And he basically told people they had to have sex with, with, uh, two year olds, three year olds, four year olds. So it was a sex cult. And when people would be either kicked out of that coal or run away, my theory is that pimps found them on the streets and, and started learning from them, but the religious terminology that family, et Cetera. Um, and uh, so the sex trafficking and then the other thing that is occupying a lot of people's consciousnesses, terrorist cults like Isis, Boko Haram, which are trafficking women by the way.

Speaker 1:          01:30:43       Um, and they're taking not just weak, uh, stupid people. But, uh, for example, the one of the architects of Isis as social media recruiting that work was the son of a, of a endocrinologist at mass general hospital. Someone who has raised in Boston, went to a Catholic high school. And unfortunately or fortunately he was killed by a drone strike few months ago, this kid. But my heart goes out to them, you know, people who get deceptively recruited in mind controlled cause it happened to me and if I hadn't been deprogrammed I could have done horrible acts of violence. So that's how I was trained.

Speaker 2:          01:31:27       Wow. So they were training you to sword fight, you said? Yeah, they, they basically trained me

Speaker 1:          01:31:33       hi or kill on command. And they trained me that if I allowed a doubt when I was given an order by my superior that Satan was going to be invading me, I'll exorcist. And so, you know, whatever I was told to do, I dead. It's incredibly frightening. What literally when I saw the, the, the body's down a Jones town, my first thought was I could have done that. And when I saw the planes going into the World Trade Center, I thought, yeah, I could have done that too. That's part of my passion and what propels me so many years later because the problem hasn't gone away. It's gotten worse. Have documentaries like going clear the HBO documentary, has that helped? Definitely. It's been great. My Gripe about his book and the documentary is that it didn't deal at all with mind control or brainwashing. It didn't give anyone who was watching the documentary or reading the book tools for how to protect themselves or if they were in a cult to self reflect and analyze what was happening.

Speaker 1:          01:32:44       He's only got enough time to just fill an hour and a half or whatever it was, two hours, but there's so much. So my Rand's Joe, when when, when Wright's book first came out, I did a short video ramp. I said saying going clear as the definitive book on Scientology is like saying you've written a definitive book on cars and leaving out guests combustion engines. That was what I said. So I was frustrated. In other words, cause yeah, brilliant. People like Paul Haggis who has incredible how they would career saying I was stupid for believing this for 30 years and giving so much money to them and what has happened. He's not stupid. What has happened to those guys? They being attacked. The, the group has changed dramatically because of former leaders coming out and speaking out. The group. Anonymous helped a lot initially by harmful now homeless by wearing masks and saying, come on, let's protest.

Speaker 1:          01:33:44       It scared them and it created a culture where people were, we're more empowered to speak out against them right now. We want the tax exemption to be stripped. There's no reason we should be subsidizing a group that's paying millions of dollars to harass form. Remember, that was one of the most disturbing aspects of the movie when you find out that they, how they achieve tax exempt status by a litany of lawsuits, right? They propelled against the IRS and also hiring pis to dig up dirt on the IRS commissioners and hiring powerful lobbyists and a, it's dirty. The whole thing is dirty. Just seems too easy. Like, how can they be so easily influenced to give these mean I have to do is read one of his fucking books, right? And you go, this guy, this guy wrote Scientology, the guy real battlefield earth like fucking Christ. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:34:37       So, but the bottom line is that if, if there's a total list group that has a black and white us versus them, good versus evil, simplistic ideology that says that, um, you know, we have the vision for the world has to be a, we have the tools. So how to be the best person you can be. One needs to operate with some consumer awareness and say, who is this person? Why did his background, is he trustworthy, end whatever it is, seek critics and x members and know that if it's true, it will stand up to scrutiny. And if it isn't, you know, if it isn't true, why would you want to invest your time and your energy and your money in something that's not real?

Speaker 4:          01:35:28       People would just searching for meaning. I mean that's what a lot of this is

Speaker 1:          01:35:31       all us searching for, meaning to make their life a better. Well that's how the suck

Speaker 4:          01:35:36       you in, right? I mean, they suck you in with dianetics. When I was, uh, living in California for the first time in 94, uh, there was no internet or I hadn't been on you and it was just, it was just starting to get on. I think I might've gotten a computer around then. I, there was a late night television commercial for dianetics and of the volcano. Remember the volcano

Speaker 1:          01:35:55       of course be the OT three story is he knew when the galactic kicked dictatorship.

Speaker 4:          01:36:00       Yeah. Well the, the volcano just looked like, you know, unleashing your potential to me, like, yes. Dianetics powerful. I had, you know, listen to some Anthony Robbins books on tape and I was ready to rock and roll. You know, I was trying to stop it

Speaker 1:          01:36:11       studying. He was studying Ericsson and an LP and that is basically covert hypnotic.

Speaker 4:          01:36:18       Can you have a happier marriage in 1989 page one 11. How can you have more job satisfaction in 1989? Page two 27. Yeah, this was the commercial. So I, uh, I bought the book. I ordered it online. I don't even remember how I pay it. I guess I had a credit card. Um, and these fucking people would not stop sending me things. Right. I mean, for years, like every week or so, every month or so, whatever it was, I would get something in the mail inviting me to this, inviting me to that. I mean, it was just amazing how persistent

Speaker 1:          01:36:51       counted as one of the 8 million followers, even though there's really 20,000 or less. I was a follower. So somewhere your name. Exactly. Am I in a database? Dianetics member or title? So I'm on my end. Scientology it was I at one point in time, no. Well, how would I counted then? Uh, because they, cults like to fudge statistics. They're much bigger than they really are. So what is the actual number of Scientologists number that my friends tell me? It's 20,000 or less. That's not that many in the world. That's it. Yeah. So how do they have so much real estate? They have billions of dollars. They've sucked a lot of wealthy people dry. That's incredible. Yeah. Paul Haggis paid a shit load of money. Right. That's one of the things you talked about. Yup. Hubbard was into money and power. Let me empower sex. It's the three Universal's with all destructive cults. Yeah. Like the Waco thing. Right. They always want to have sex with everybody. His wife. Um, yeah. Power money. Uh,

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       interestingly I met the, I met Byron sage last December. Who is the lead FBI negotiator with David Koresh at Waco.

Speaker 2:          01:38:04       Is he the guy that sent the tanks in to burn everybody out here?

Speaker 3:          01:38:07       I'm afraid so, or somebody that you're going to negotiate the FBI? No, he was, he was clearly, um, unhappy and he more or less said that we didn't know what we were doing and we wish that you had, you know, we had known what to do.

Speaker 2:          01:38:23       He was clearly unhappy with the result. He, he knew that they screwed up. Well that's a nice way of saying they murdered a bunch of people

Speaker 3:          01:38:31       cause that's what they did. The videos, well, they should never have gone established. You know, they should never have gone in with guns in the first place. The David Koresh was molesting minors and they were, you know, making automatic weapons but the lord him into town and arrested him and they could have taken away the guns and

Speaker 2:          01:38:50       they were sure that he molested minors. Oh yeah. How old were the miners? It's hen very, Joel

Speaker 3:          01:39:00       testified before Congress. It was one of his victims. But, um, I just, I guess because of the, I want to come back to how I learned about you and, and, and, and your good work with Stephin. Mala knew if I may and free domain radio,

Speaker 2:          01:39:16       that was, you could say good work. It's just a conversation where I asked him some questions,

Speaker 3:          01:39:20       but it helped a lot of members wake up because they respect you and they got to listen to their divine leader lie, you know, and, and it was powerful to hear him say, oh no, I don't tell people the Dfo, I always tell people to go to therapists before they cut off from all their family and friends. And people knew that that was a blatant lie. And it took a chink out of the mysticism of people who were true believers because you held your own with him. You know, he didn't, you know, wrap you around his finger as he's used to doing with the followers and their respect for you. So I, I, my hat's off.

Speaker 2:          01:40:10       It wasn't my intention. My intention was just to have a conversation with them and trying to figure out what he's doing or what his thought process is. He's got some really good ideas about things. It's, it's fascinating. He's, he's a very eloquent guy and he's very smart, obviously, and he has some really interesting concepts, but he's very firm in his belief about certain things as well, to the point where you're like, one of the things that I talked to him about, we played a video of him yelling about someone, if you believe in the state that you want him killed, you want me killed, and that you should get rid of all of your friends that believe in the state, you know, and this idea of a narco capitalism, her kids, and like you, you don't want any government whatsoever. Like who's going to fix the streets? So there was, and there was no answers to those whose going to pay for anything, who's going to, who's going to organize, where were, what do you, how are you going to like, this is not like a well thought out thing. This is like this someone, someone said it best that he's an incredibly eloquent man that is screaming north while pretending to be holding a camera

Speaker 1:          01:41:15       bus. That's interesting. While he's another one of those, you know, and like corporations, while he's owning a corporation type people and you know, saying that he's liberating people and he's in fact enslaving people into a totalistic belief system.

Speaker 2:          01:41:35       Do you think that he's, do you think this is just something that sort of happened along the way? Like as he was, you know, I honestly having his philosophy and

Speaker 1:          01:41:44       I don't know enough about him, I was hired by a family to consult to help a young man who was getting sucked in and they were worried about that. He would try to cut off contact. And fortunately he's okay. So it was a relatively new phenomenon for me but was particularly interesting about this particular call was that he was recruiting over over the Internet and that's how isis is largely recruiting as well. So it was an interesting,

Speaker 2:          01:42:11       well you say recruiting though. How has he, how he recruit, he just does videos where he kind of talks about his ideas.

Speaker 1:          01:42:18       Right? Right. And he gets followers to tell other people to watch the videos and they watch for hours and hours and hours and they, it, they re he rewires their thought processes to the point where he gets them to question their own belief systems, their own value systems. And because he's a bully and he's a loud mouth and he talks so confidently about a lot of things that he doesn't really know very well. What play, we talked a little bit before about Robin Williams and that has just one small example.

Speaker 2:          01:42:57       Yeah. The Robin Williams one really disturbed me. It's one of the things that I questioned him on because he said that he believed that Robin Williams, he made a video. We're saying that Rob Williams killed himself because of all the women that we're addicted to. Free Shit I think is the way he described it, that these women who were addicted to getting money from him, they sucked him dry. Robin and I had the same agent and he was worth millions of dollars when he died. He was not broken any way, shape or form. He certainly was diminishing in his ability or is it ability to earn money was diminishing as he was getting older, but that's just normal for actors. Right. You know, he, he was, he had real depression and he also had Parkinson's and the Parkinson's medication that he was on, one of the side effects was severe depression.

Speaker 2:          01:43:45       Uh, also, um, there's a good friend of mine, Dr. Mark Gordon, who had, he's done a lot of work, uh, people with traumatic brain injuries. He wrote a paper on, um, uh, surgery and how, uh, people who have undergone a large, very traumatic surgeries like bro Robin when had open heart surgery oftentimes experience postsurgery depression and that it's a physiological response to your body being under an anesthesia for long periods of time plus the physical trauma of the actual surgery itself, the injury and you know, your body's healing. And especially as you're older, that is a massive task to heal a heart that has been cut open and stitched up and your, your chest plate has been spread apart. It's very traumatic, physically traumatic, and that oftentimes can lead to a diminished a state of consciousness. And then depression sets and also the reality of mortality sets in on a lot of people. So I was upset at that because I just didn't understand why he would do that, but I didn't, I didn't have that conversation with him, like trying to expose him. I had that conversation with him, just ask him questions and then after it was over, that's when all these videos started coming out. And that's when I realized that he was deceptive about a few things in the conversation.

Speaker 3:          01:45:09       Yeah. It was initially fantasizing that you would invite him back and I would be here and then some families who have been cut off from their loved one would be here and we could be like, you know, dude, tell all your followers to get a therapist and reconnect with their families. Like if you really care, like do something.

Speaker 2:          01:45:32       Yeah. The diff, the defunding thing was one of the things that he swing his family of origin after hello family aboard. And He, uh, apparently is fond of telling certain people to, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:45:45       got rid of all of his followers. And not just your family though, your friends, your childhood friends that have nothing to do with your family. He, because he wants people not to have other influences in their life that can say, hey dude,

Speaker 2:          01:46:00       do you think this is conscious? Do you think this is a conscious thing or do you think this is a natural state of someone trying to achieve power? What do you mean what, what is, what is the mechanism behind that?

Speaker 3:          01:46:11       I, um, I don't know about him specifically. I would say most cult leaders are not cold calculating con artists, they're delusional. They often were victims of mind control themselves and are kind of playing out of, uh, an identification with the aggressor type scenario. Uh, I don't know enough about him to comment intelligently, but for me it's about wanting people to reclaim their personal power. And I want to say to anyone who's involved with Molyneux who may be listening to this is take, take time out, step back, learn about mind control, learn about cults, talk to former leaders, talked to former members, reflect over your own experience. Ask yourself what, when you were first getting involved with mile and a, what did you think you were getting into when you were first getting involved? Did you believe you were going to be cutting off from your family, your friends, your life, dropping out of school, turning over your trust funds? And if the answer was turning over your trust, when who's turning over your money,

Speaker 2:          01:47:20       what do you mean? And what, what, who's turning over money?

Speaker 3:          01:47:23       I can't quote a particular person, but that's the pattern with all these groups as if they know that you have money, they want it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:47:30       Yeah. But as far as I know more than you, he's not asking people to give them all their money. He's not doing that. He's not asking people to turn over their trust fund. He might ask for like small donations, but I don't think it's fair to say that he's asking people to turn over.

Speaker 3:          01:47:43       I don't want to misspeak. So if you are sure about that.

Speaker 2:          01:47:47       Yeah, I've never heard of that. I've never heard that accusation. But what my impression from him when I first met him was that he's very intelligent and oftentimes very intelligent people are frustrated by really stupid people that are around them. And when he has solutions for particular, particular issues that are in society or particular behavior patterns, he speaks about them very confidently and people, uh, become enthralled with that. And then I think that's a very addictive process. The addictive process of offering solutions, having people praise you for those solutions. And then having people come to you for advice and sometimes you get ahead of yourself. You just see this momentum in that and sometimes you get in front of the wheel and you can't stop it and then you're just spouting off about everything. Like he would do these videos, the truth about this or the truth about that.

Speaker 2:          01:48:36       The truth about people that died and you're talking about like people that had very complex lives, they lived a hundred years or whatever the fuck they lived and the you, you can't just boil that down into one video with very little research, especially when you're doing a hundred of their videos a week and you're doing all these interviews and doing podcasts and doing all these things that you, you're talking about someone's life, man. You can't see the truth about Lincoln unless you fucking study Lincoln for a long period of time. And even then, like Dan Carlin is my favorite historian, doesn't even call himself in the story, but as, as a podcaster, he's brilliant in his podcast, hardcore history. One of the best things about it, he will offer opposing points of view. He will say, some people believe that this is what happens. There's, there's some dispute about this because it seems to be there just certain schools of thought about why this took place.

Speaker 2:          01:49:27       I think that's super important. So whenever he starts saying the truth about something like, man, that you're just, you just can't do that, you know? And that's why the truth about Robin Williams as a person, as a professional stand up comedian, right. It was particularly offensive to me cause I'm like, come on man, you know, you're talking about this beloved guy who had this incredibly complex relationship just with his ex wives, but with show business, with life, with depression, with drugs. Like this is not something you can just boil down to a one hour podcast or a one hour youtube video and just called the truth about someone.

Speaker 3:          01:50:01       Right? So I want to mention there's a retired, uh, child protective agency, social worker named David Cooperson, who wrote a book about corporal punishment because that's one of a Mala news claims, et cetera. And, and cooperson has studied a number of vol new videos and the whole ideology, and he's written a great book by the way, it's on a stop legal child. abuse.com is David's website and he just more or less says as someone who's worked with children who've been traumatized, whether it was beaten by their, their parents or their foster parents are sexually abused. The best thing is not to cut off contact with the abuse of family. It's to have therapists and to have a healthy frame to work within it. And not just to impose from the outside or by some authority figure who says that they know what's better for them. Because even kids who are being abused still have feelings towards their mother or father that are positive because of the way we're wired.

Speaker 3:          01:51:10       So anyway, I wanted to get a plugin for his book and the fact that, and then I wanted to mention Molly Kotch, Molly be Kotch k o c h. Dot. Com wrote a book on parenting called 27 secrets to raising amazing children. And she too, when I asked her to comment as an expert on parenting about what [inaudible] was saying with saying, this is not going to help people to be healthier human beings, to cuddle off contact from family and friends no matter what happened in their childhood. But the best thing is with therapy and ideally with a family therapist to approach it to the extent that people, uh, are protected so they're not further abused by their family of origin.

Speaker 2:          01:51:56       Well, this seems very black and white to me because if you're coming from an, an incredibly abusive family and your, your, your family was brutal and they beat you and I did horrible things to you, which I know people who've come from cutting them off is a great idea. I disagree. Really. So you think if your father sexually abused you, rapes you, beats you up, it comes home and an alcoholic rage and breaks your skull, you should still call that guy.

Speaker 3:          01:52:20       I didn't say that, but what do you mean if that, if you're in that area. But if you're in that scenario, um, I'm saying you should be in therapy if that's happened to you and your therapist should, should consider, depending on the course of treatment approaching the f the father or the mother and getting them into therapy, maybe they need to get off of alcohol or drugs or maybe they they need therapy. But just cutting off your entire background and past as a chop it off for me is really not a healthy long term solution.

Speaker 2:          01:52:58       But not even saying cutting off your entire past. I'm saying don't have contact with someone who was horrible to you. You don't.

Speaker 3:          01:53:05       So what, what I'm trying to say Joe, as a therapist and I've seen these situations, I'm also involved with parental alienation cases where there's a divorce and the custodial parent brainwashers the children against the father or the mother, which is horrendous. People can grow, keep people can change, people can evolve and whatever is on. Also there's false memory syndrome where people were getting in with, uh, not good therapists or using hypnosis or getting into cults and being like, I was believing I had this horrible childhood. Just cutting off and saying I can't ever talk with them again is not a healthy choice in my opinion. Being being with an ethical therapist and finding a way to who evaluate what's happening with them and getting them into treatment and then PR potentially to have some type of family therapy situation if it's not going to be helpful ultimately, then of course don't, don't reach victimize yourself. Don't allow yourself to continue to be abused. But this kind of, this notion of lopping off your father, your mother, your sister, your brother because they were Shitty to you 20 years ago or 40 years ago, I think is a mistake as a therapist.

Speaker 2:          01:54:25       Do you, you think it's a mistake across the board? I do, but what it, but there are gotta be scenarios where you shouldn't be hanging out with your brother because your brother used to rape you or your brother used to beat me. [inaudible] I'm not talking about hanging out and communicating with them. Why have any contact with someone who horribly abused you were just because their family would you do that to a friend? So this idea that blood and DNA somehow or another make you inexorably connected to some person that was horribly abusive to you. If you had a friend that you grew up with and your friend, he's to rape you and beat the fuck out of you. You supposed to still contact them because they were your friend and they'll always be in your life.

Speaker 3:          01:55:04       Uh, I think a friend who raped me, uh, is a different category than a father. A brother, a sister, a brother. Well, how's it different? Um, cause it's bloody right.

Speaker 2:          01:55:14       Yes. That seems crazy. Family seems like ape thinking. That's like monkey thinking. That doesn't even make any sense. Well, I mean if someone, if someone was horribly abusive to you and they're an evil person and we both agree that there are evil people in the world, right? Yeah. Someone was

Speaker 3:          01:55:27       evil to you 30 years ago. The question is, are they still evil today? Why? Find out

Speaker 2:          01:55:34       why not? Cause he's not enough time. The if a hundred years, if you're lucky, you know, I mean if you, if you want to really try to fix someone who raped you and beat you up most of your childhood or would you rather just move on?

Speaker 3:          01:55:46       Oh, who are like raising the children of God and they were raped by their brothers and sisters and fathers and mothers and they want to have a healthy relationship with their children because they realize that's the past that's not now and that they were doing the best they could under those circumstances because that's how they were indoctrinated to be.

Speaker 2:          01:56:06       But this is a different thing you're talking about people having, you just said people having a relationship with their own children. You're not talking about people that the people that raped them and abused them. You're not talking about people having a relationship with those people.

Speaker 3:          01:56:19       So, for example, I mean, when they were in, for example, a cult, like the children of God, they weren't thinking that their father and mother were raping them and their aunt and their uncle raping it, but they were having abusive sex, right? That was not something that they were ready for or wanted it to have and it hurt and et cetera. Now they're out and for me to just say, look, you know, cut off all contact and, and assume there's no possibility that they could grow. They can change, they can evolve, they can apologize, they can make it up to you. For me, that's, that's not the ideal. It's not what my, my position as a healer, as someone who's worked with so many other people now, and I'm not saying is if you've been hurt by someone to just call them up and then have them hurt you, that's, I'm not saying that. I'm saying use professionals as mediators to see what's possible in terms of constructive, healthy change.

Speaker 2:          01:57:22       But you're, you're, you're putting this in this family context and this is where it confuses me like that. You should do that because they're your family, but you shouldn't do that if they were your friend.

Speaker 3:          01:57:31       No, I'm not. I guess I'm not meaning to sound so absolute and every case should be evaluated individually, but I, I do have, I guess I've had too many cases where it was this kind of total cuddle off. Right. I see what you're saying and maybe it's justified, but maybe it's not. Maybe the person really, you know, got great therapy and they are incredibly remorseful and they want to apologize and there are a decent human being. You can keep carrying the pain and the judgment and say, I'll know I'll never talk with you again. Or try to accept them for where they are now and see whether or not they're going to be beneficial to your ongoing.

Speaker 2:          01:58:15       It shouldn't the onus be on the person who victimize you. If someone raped you and beat you, shouldn't the onus be on them to come and apologize to you or attempt to apologize to you? I got to spray them out and bring them to therapy and try to hash it out with them.

Speaker 3:          01:58:29       I would agree with that. Yeah, I would agree with that. I think everyone ultimately has to take responsibility for their own lives and their own actions. I mean, I felt terrible for a lot of the things that I did in the Mooney is, and I did best to reach out to people I had recruited who I, whose lives I had interfered with and, and it was a burden for many, many years. As long as they continue to be in the group and they're all out now. But virtually no one wants to talk with me. I think they still harbor really bad feelings towards me.

Speaker 2:          01:59:00       Wow. That's gotta be so strange for you to be in the position that you're in now, to have these people that look at you as someone who victimize them. And the very way you're trying to shield people from today.

Speaker 3:          01:59:12       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:59:14       so the, that's probably flavoring this idea that you're, you know, you want people to always try to hash it out or work it out because of your own personal experiences. Well, let, I think people can grow and people can change. They can or they cannot write. But also stagger them and advocate for change. I am too, but I'm also, I also believe there's some people that are just beyond fucked up and there's nothing you can do about them and it's not a bad idea to cut them off. I know I have their parents off and they're very happy because of it, because their parents were evil and the parents are fucked up. I mean, and there, every time they would be with them or communicate with them would just be incredibly damaging and they would have to deal with it for months on end and the stress and the pain, we're just not worth it. And ultimately they felt better to, you know, to forgive that person but not communicate with them.

Speaker 3:          02:00:00       See, here's where we differ. Uh, I guess if I have more of the Jewish angle on forgiveness, like I don't believe in forgiving people, don't apologize and don't offer compensation and don't promise never to do it again and then never do it again. That's kind of the Jewish formula and only then is the person who was wrong in a position to forgive. But I'm not of the thing of just forgive. But I, I guess I, I think ultimately the more sense of fullness of wholeness, of knowing that we do everything that's within our power, our sphere of influence to do, to be a good person, to, to bring goodness to the planet is the way to operate. And I think that for me, with my father, he, he didn't beat me, but he didn't hug me. He didn't, you know, give me a lot of praise when I was growing up because his father never gave him that. And instead of at the, when I was in therapy, instead of being angry at him, he neve under stepping into his shoes as a child, realizing he was doing the best that he could. And at 30 I just, when I saw him, I just started hugging him and he'd be like a board and I'd be, I just say s stand there because I need a hug. And by the time he was in his eighties, he was actually wanting the hug and he

Speaker 2:          02:01:37       50 years. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       Yeah. It took 50 years. It actually said, I love you. And I'm proud of you. He died at 92 but I got to see my father evolve. And what is the big difference between that and someone would beat the shit out of you and raped you. That's a lot of people's reality when you're dealing with their parents. I mean, your dad doesn't sound abusive. He just sounded like he's the victim of his own. He wasn't abusive and I had a relatively normal cha, you know, boring in many ways cause they didn't smoke. They didn't drink, they didn't have affairs. I lived in the same house. That wasn't like moving all over the, you know, it wasn't a child of divorce. But I guess I want to just come back to everyone needs to kind of be in touch with their inner voice, their inner intuition and instead of holding of frozen frame in their mind of what happened 30 years ago and just keeping that, eh, I can't be with him because of that. Find out what's going on. And I'm not saying put yourself in a position where you can be harmed, but you can use third parties to find out what's going on there and there could be some really radical positive changes that happen. That could be a really good thing. I see here

Speaker 2:          02:02:58       in up to a certain degree, there's a certain degree of abuse that I think some parents have enacted on their children. There was a story that someone told me recently about this brother that was raping his sister and the, you know, this went on for years and then the dad found out about it and the dad joined in and this went on for more years.

Speaker 2:          02:03:20       Those people can both go fuck themselves. If I was that girl and if I knew that girl, I would tell them to, I would tell him never, never contact them, never talked to them. There's no need. You don't. Just because they're your blood, that doesn't mean anything. It's nonsense. Your family, you know, you can have family that's not related to you. The people that you love and trust and if you treat them like they are family, they'll treat you like family too. I think you choose the people that you can be in contact with and that's the problem that a lot of people have with this whole idea of family is that you're born into them. You don't, it's like just, you just get a random hand of cards, right? You know, and that's your family and you just have to accept that for the rest of your life.

Speaker 2:          02:03:58       And then when they fuck up, you have to keep trying to forgive them or help them or bring them together or not. I say not say with certain people like that girl whose brother and dad raped her. This no fucking need to bring those people into your life. If you can get away from them, stay away from them. Hopefully they're in jail. Now. I don't know what happened in that particular situation, but I grew up with a father that beat the fuck out of my mother and I saw it a bunch of times when I was little and I was five years old. And my mom laughed. So these images are very old and they're very distorted, but there are 100% real. There's, there's certain things that were undeniable, the physical abuse, and I have had no desire to talk to that person ever since, and I don't ever want to, I don't need it. You know, this idea of blood that this, because this person had sex with my mom and made me that I have to forgive this dummy and spend time with them and try to work out why beat the fuck out of my mom in front of me. I don't need that. And I don't think that, I don't think you need that to heal and grow. I don't think it's necessary

Speaker 3:          02:05:01       and I'm not imposing my point of view on you. I'm just sharing my point of view as a therapist who's seen literally hundreds and hundreds of different cases and people can change. I also want to go, come back to the false memory point because there's a lot of people who went into therapy or they got into a cult and they came to have the belief that are in a satanic cult. They were beaten and tortured by, by their family. And it's not true, but there's still acting as if it is. And there's no effort to reality test to actually talk to the siblings or talk with the neighbors or see if there's a, most sexual predators have multiple victims. They're usually not just enacting on one particular person. Um, and what I've been saying from the beginning is, you know, find a good therapist who's experienced with trauma and sexual abuse and such, and, and do it to your process and consider, and especially if there's anyone listening who's a follower of Stefan Molyneux who's cut off contact with their brothers and their sisters and their mothers.

Speaker 3:          02:06:15       Is this an epidemic? I think there are a hundreds really. I think there were hundreds and I'm just saying, take a timeout from Molyneux. Stop listening to his podcasts for a few weeks. Learn about mind control. Learn about cults. Read the book. I, I, I watched a video that was put on line by a follower of Molyneux who was, you know, had just left and I, I reached out to him. I said, I've, I've got free videos on my freedom of mind website. Check out my book. And he just emailed me literally yesterday was this morning saying, you know, it's given me a new understanding about everything. Thank you so much. And, and if you have cut off contact for years and years and years, find someone to reach out to your family and create a way pack. Because a lot of people are afraid to even reach out and they're confused still because they're like Israel.

Speaker 3:          02:07:16       Yeah. I've had some people who've left Scientology, for example, come to me because they many years of being in the call didn't go to mom when she was dying in the hospital. They didn't go to their brother's wedding and they were supposed to be the best man. What? They borrowed money over and over and over again. The families like, screw you, we never want to hear from you again. Now that person's woken up, they've left Scientology and nobody in the family wants anything to do with them. And I feel like I at least should make an effort to say to them, you know, there is such a thing as mine control and they were doing what they thought they were supposed to do. I being in the cult and you know you were right to be angry at them, for not being there for mom and for not being there. However, that doesn't mean that they're bad, bad people and that there isn't some value and reconnecting. Again,

Speaker 2:          02:08:10       it was one of the more disturbing parts of going clear was seeing the people that were just emotionally devastated by the fact their family wouldn't talk to them anymore because they had been excommunicated.

Speaker 3:          02:08:20       Right. So this disconnection, the JW is call it this fellow shipping. It's a common mind control technique to manipulate people, to cut them off from family and friends. If people are breaking no rules or questioning the authority, et Cetera, it's not something that should be done by any legitimate religion. Certainly not any, any legitimate organization telling people you can't talk to your sister, your brother, your mother, your father, because some, some authority figure says God doesn't want it, or that you've violated the rules.

Speaker 2:          02:08:57       Well, either they're taking it to another level right there saying you can't talk to them because it's against the rules to talk to them. They're not encouraging the fooling, you know, getting rid of your family of original origin. They're there. They're encouraging. They're saying there's no rule. There's a rule. I mean, it's not encouraging. They're there. They're actually saying like, you can't talk to them.

Speaker 3:          02:09:19       Right? And if you do talk with them, then you risk being kicked out of the group too. Right? That's the threat. Now, one of the things about mind control cults is, um, like I was shown the exorcist, if I was going to leave the moonies part of my unconscious, saw that little girl with the et cetera in the mind of someone on the mind control, they can't visualize themselves out of the group being happy and fulfilled. And, and in the mind of Scientologists, if you leave, you're going to go insane. You're going to commit suicide, you're going to become a drug addict is no possible. And they put phobia's a member's minds against any mental health professional. So if you're feeling suicidal, if you are having major Migraines, only do auditing only do Scientology techniques. And at the point that I think it was Paul Haggis that you know, we refuse to, you know, refute his gay daughter when, when he learned that Scientology came out against the bill in California at that, that was his wake up call because his love for his daughter trumped the cult ideology.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       How bizarre is that? That Scientology has an anti homosexual ideas?

Speaker 3:          02:10:41       I think it's very bizarre, but a lot of cults are very anti, but why? What is, what does Hubbard was a homophobe, is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah. Probably. He had sexual drives towards men that he couldn't deal with, so he decided to make a rule and make it into a horrible thing.

Speaker 2:          02:10:59       So how does it fit with a guy like John Travolta who's allegedly gay? That seems so bizarre.

Speaker 3:          02:11:07       It's, it's incredibly horrible because essentially you can't eat it. The cult. The cult identity does not want to acknowledge the person's true self and every time he acts out his true nature, he feels bad.

Speaker 2:          02:11:23       But the speculation is that they have some dirt on him. The speculation is that through the auditing process or the files they keep on you, that was what they implied in the documentary that they have these stacks of files on

Speaker 3:          02:11:34       and they do massages, folders, et cetera. They send that in the Time magazine cover story in 1990. Uh, there's a huge amount of fear and threat that if you leave the group or speak out against the group, they're going to come after you and ruin your life. And unfortunately a lot of people have fear and for me and other people who've left, you kind of have to rise above it and say, screw you, I'm not going to live like that. We're scrolling towel, whatever you want to tell that screw you.

Speaker 2:          02:12:08       For certain people though that the ideology of Scientology, the, the, the, the, the tenants or the, you know, the principals seem to help them give them some sort of structure. I mean, is there any way that there's anything beneficial to like the way they, I mean there's a lot of successful people that are Scientologists and they seem like ambitious and motivated. It seems like there's part of it, and I'm not trying to support Scientology, but I'm trying to look at this in a balanced perspective. It seems like at least some of what they're doing is trying to enhance your ability to function as a person, right? Is that not true?

Speaker 3:          02:12:43       Uh, they say one thing and what they do as another thing, they say that they're going to give you power over your mind and your body over matter and are joining a clean space. But a lot of it comes down to the belief that's programmed into the Scientology identity. That you have this higher truth that you understand the nature of reality, that a certain technique is going to work. But what we know from the placebo effect, the power of authority and the power of suggestion is what's happening here. It's not the techniques itself, it's not the ideology.

Speaker 2:          02:13:20       And also the, the, the feeling of being empowered by being a part of a successful group, a successful group, and the motivation that they give you. You got a buggy. Yeah, it's pretty late. [inaudible] five 30 and this half an hour ago. Your bladder's talking. Go ahead. And then there's a bathroom right over there and we'll just wrap this up. Then I'll, I'll tell everybody. All right. That's, uh, we're going to wrap this up here, combating cult mind control, Steve Assan and you can get a hold of Steve on Twitter. His Twitter handle is, hold on one second. Hall. It is a cult expert at cult expert on Twitter. Um, so Nate and conversation, I don't know if I agree with him on everything, but, but obviously a very knowledgeable guy and a very nice guy. So, uh, that's a, that's a wrap. You fucks. We'll be back tomorrow. That's right. Bitches. The fight companion returns tomorrow. 7:00 PM Pacific Time. Eddie Bravo. Brennan shot. Brian Cowen, the full
