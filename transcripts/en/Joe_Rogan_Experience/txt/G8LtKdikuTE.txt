Naturebox is my newest addiction around the office and a lot of people on my message board. I had questions about exactly how healthy it is. Well, you can vary it at naturebox. You could be like a real freak and go, uh, the gluten free route, which is how I did it. Or you can get a little sketchy with shit like pretzels.

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       Let's be honest. It's only you can only make pretzels so healthy. There's really not a lot you could do to them that makes them actually healthy. Pretzels are fucking pretzels man. But what naturebox do have products are natural and contained a much higher quality ingredients than the typical vending machine. Food ingredients there is over 100 snacks. Choose from. And if you look for something with certain dietary needs, like wheat free, lower sugar content, etc. They have that too.

Speaker 2:          00:06:21       login experience, joe rogan podcast by night all day.

Speaker 1:          00:06:30       I love when people are really, really, really into shit and user are really, really, really into coffee. That's true. And what's important about people like you is that people like me who really do love coffee, but I know nothing about it and I'm not going to do all that research. It's just not going to happen, man. It's just too, too much work. I need someone like you out there that's obsessed with coffee that can bring me some coffee that smells like lemons. I'm here for you. What is this stuff that you brought? You brought this ethiopian blend that was warm when we got it.

Speaker 3:          00:07:01       Yeah. Okay. So, um, I brought you ethiopian coffee because okay. At some point. So I'm a coffee guy, right? I've been working in coffee for years, 25 years or more. And when you're a coffee guy, everybody asks you their coffee questions. And the number one question that people start asking you is, what's your favorite coffee? You know, everybody wants to know that. So now most coffee people, when they're asked that question a little bit, the way I lied was I would say a that's like asking a parent who their favorite child is. You know what I mean? You can't, you're not allowed to. You got a coffee problem. Right? Right. Yeah. I got allowed to do that. Right. You're not allowed to do that. You're not allowed to play favorites, et cetera. But, uh, putting that lie aside, most coffee people are affectionate about coffee from Ethiopia because that's where coffees from originates. It originates.

Speaker 1:          00:07:51       Of course. I'm going to be beautiful shit out. It smells so good. By the way, what is the name of this particular blend that you made? It's

Speaker 3:          00:07:58       called yirgacheffe. And you're a chef is the name of a town in southern Ethiopia and it is in coffee to coffee people. You're a chef. Is like a mecca. Yeah, that's the spot. This smells unbelievable. That's what. And that's why it it. It's uh, it's so famous. The coffee smells like flowers and um, and then like lemons, like lemon oil or something. And that's really unique if you, if you taste coffee that tastes, smells and case like this, it's almost certain that it comes from Ethiopia because because of the variety they grow there because the way that they process it, etc. It makes it really special. So, um, this was roasted by, by company in san francisco called wrecking ball coffee and the coffee is called Ethiopia classic yirgacheffe classic meaning shove again. Why I g m, why I g

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       r wait, sorry. Y I r g a, c h e f, f e isn't a weird thing where you have to write it down to look at it to make sure it's right. Well, the other weird thing too is that that's one way to spell it. There's like if you're in yoga chef and you look at signs, they're all spelled a different way because it's actually an mri tech. It's a different language and they just translate it to english and various ways. So you can spell it. There's, I've been in involved in internet. Okay. Here's another coffee geek admission. I've been involved in these internet conversations about how you should spell yoga show also how you should pronounce it, but in in ethiopian they pronounce it differently in a way that I can't actually pronounce it. How do they say give it a shot or a gut check or good chef.

Speaker 4:          00:09:40       Yeah, exactly. The last thing is like, it's like a breathing, but you just did it when, how we get to do it. There was an ethiopian guy next to me. Yeah, exactly. I feel like, you know, like saying I've just been to roma or something like that is a weird thing. Have my friend amber lyon who's coming on the podcast soon. She was talking about boxing. Yeah, exactly. Instead of Bahrain, which is almost, she was saying, but then she, she let it go and she said, by rain, I'm like, wait a minute. I got to be one or the other here in southern California in the newscasters suddenly just goes into the perfect spanish pronunciation. Yes, yes. Burrito. Yeah, exactly. That's very important. If you want to maintain the latin audience, you gotta roll your r's. But anyway, I don't try for that with coffee names because it's a little too low.

Speaker 4:          00:10:21       Well, you're taking a chance on being like already like kind of labeled as a crazy coffee person. But if you could pronounce all the words then the pretentiousness level. It gets very risky. Well, it's, you know, that's the thing with being a coffee person, you know, because people are afraid that you're going to be like a kind of a douchebag about, about, about your coffee, you know, because. Because it's a weird conundrum because on the one hand people like that you take it seriously and, and because you're trying to, you're trying to make, you know, embrace something that's super delicious and you want it to be more delicious and better tasting and stuff like that. And so that causes you to learn stuff about the geography of where coffee comes from and all this weird trivia, you know, and, and, uh, you start to learn about that stuff and it's good.

Speaker 4:          00:11:09       But at the Same time, it's very easy when you get really into something to start to alienate people, you know, and that goes for anything that goes for wine or food or you know, any sort of hobby, you know, when people can't talk about anything else and then they start to get kind of snobby about stuff. But. And so it's a struggle for coffee people all the time, you know, because what I know and I've learned in my many years of doing this thing is that, especially in the morning, you know, people just want their coffee, they don't want to fuck around with, with, you know all this, stuff like that. And we learned that in, in, you know. So I started as a barista. I worked for many, many years as a barista behind the car, behind the bar, making people their coffee in the morning.

Speaker 4:          00:11:55       so do you really appreciate like when someone's a connoisseur, like the difference between the guys, like I just want a cup of coffee and a guy's like, what's your blends today? A guy like who's really into it? Lots of times it's the same person, like a person that later in the day will be like all into what kind of coffee it is and really particular everybody just their first cup of coffee, they just want a freaking cup of coffee. Even even coffee pros like me, you know, we dispense with all that stuff that, that time when you know you've been there, you wake up in the morning, you don't know what's going on. All you want is a cup of coffee and people to be nice to you for the first couple of hours of your day. Usually most of the time when I don't have any time and I just want some sort of caffeine, I, I have one of those little suppress things.

Speaker 4:          00:12:40       Will you put those little capsules in there and you catch it down, you press the button and a shot of espresso comes out. Um, are those bad? Well, it doesn't taste as good as the real. That's the thing. They're convenient, you know, and, and whether they're there, there's a lot of disadvantages to a, to a thing like that. On the other hand, I've tasted delicious coffee out of, out of those real. If the coffee going in is, is good if the machine is working right? I mean there's all sorts of different kinds of machines. WhaT is the expect you to know this because you don't manufacture these things, but what is the. Is there plastic right? Is that what it is? Like a, some out of aluminum. Others that are made out of plastic? Yeah. Yeah. I think the ones I have are aluminum. So is that stuff okay for the flavor when you're heating that up, eating up the illumina.

Speaker 4:          00:13:29       It doesn't mess it up. Yeah. That's not the problem. The problem that's aluminum is pretty resistant to stuff like that. And they make that metal work, you know, it's like a soda pop cans so they have an engineered it to work well. So it's not an issue with flavor, it's just an issue of what's in it will rise and also how the, how the machine works. So if like you guys made coffee here today and you did it in a great way by boiling the water in a kettle and then you have a french press and use it. now, the great thing about that is that you're boiling the water. The water is getting to 212. That's where it boils. And then by the time you pour it in the french press, it's cooled off. Maybe it's 200, seven, 205. Is that where you should have it at 195 to 205 degrees is where you should be.

Speaker 4:          00:14:13       Oh my gosh. It's crazy. I know he, he got so intense, 195 to 200, five degrees and sunny spot. It is, it's the honey spot. That's what, that's where we get guys like me get fired up over stuff like, well we bought today's the first day of using it here. What I have at home, which is I think it's called breville b r e v I l l e and it's uh, it'll show you like you could have one button for oolong tea. the other button for french press and so this was the french press button. So I assume they get it right then. That's even better than what it did. And this is breville. They make some wonderful, incredible coffee equipment. Yeah, they do. And uh, and so the french press button will, I'm sure get it to 205 degrees. We should put a thermometer in that bitch.

Speaker 4:          00:14:58       Find out whether or not I bet. Find out we need a thermometer. Just me. And it's very important. Um, well that's the thing guys like me, we have thermometers at home because we, it makes a difference. So. No, but check this out. So I believe what I was going to say is the machines, whether it's a pod machine or a capsule machine like you're talking about or a mr coffee type machine, black and decker, whatever, all those kinds of coffee machines. One of the big challenges with those things as if they don't get hot enough. If they're brewing coffee at 180 degrees, it's going to taste like crap. And so you're cooking it while you're brewing it. Yeah, exactly. So the water is hot,

Speaker 3:          00:15:35       you know, some amount of hot and if it's, and if it's the right amount of hot in between one and 95 and 205, right about 200 degrees, then it makes the coffee taste.

Speaker 4:          00:15:46       So it actually literally changes the flavor that's coming out of the beans when it's hot enough to activate it, right? So, and too hot is bad, too hot is bad. And so here's, here's the deal with coffee. It's like if you looked at it under a microscope,

Speaker 3:          00:15:58       took a slice of it and then looked at that under a microscope, you'd see all the cellular structure of the coffee and it's like a sponge. And inside the sponge is all the oils and sugars and fats and stuff that may really complicated. It's thousands of little different chemicals in there that, um, that you need to get out of the sponge. You need to essentially rinse it out of the coffee to get it into your cup. And that's what brewing is all about. Now, um, if you don't do that well enough, you leave all the good tasting stuff in the coffee that sponge, the coffee cell walls, you know, and it doesn't get into your cup and your, and your coffee doesn't taste very good and plus you've wasted all the good stuff. You wind up throwing it in the trash. If the opposite thing happens, if you extract too much out of the coffee, if you squeeze that sponge till it's perfectly dry, then the last stuff to get extracted tastes kind of bitter. And uh, like tannic, it, it doesn't, it doesn't taste good. It has a characteristic that we call over extracted.

Speaker 4:          00:17:10       And so that bitter tannin comes from a prolonged exposure to hot water. Either the water being too hot

Speaker 3:          00:17:16       or you bring it for too long or a. Or like for example, if you boiled coffee like they used to do in the cowboy days, he used to like boil coffee over the campfire that will make the coffee taste

Speaker 4:          00:17:28       bitter and accurate and offline because it's over extracted. And that over extraction is what creates tannins. A, right? Well, not tan and specifically, but those, that tannic sort of flavor, it's makes us stringency, flavor, taste in your mouth, and that bitterness is from the heat itself. Well, it's extracting, extracting bad tasting stuff out of the. So it extracts

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       all the good tasting stuff. But then there's an additional extraction, a bad tasting stuff too. Fascinating. yeah. So you want to get the stuff that's like loose. there's like a ripe fruit, right?

Speaker 3:          00:18:00       it's like right in the middle. It's this sweet spot. And so this organization that I worked for called the specialty coffee association, we in the 19 fifties, they started to do some science about this and how to brew coffee properly and get the coffee to our tasted best to the most people and they had thousands of people tasting different coffees, you know, and they determined what the perfect extraction of a cup of coffee was to most people in the, in the world. And um, and then we, then they designed a amount of extraction. So I'm going to get technical on you. Okay. So 100 night I already told you 195 to 200. Five is the right temperature, the extraction that you want to get is between 18 and 22 percent extraction. Now this is coffee geek stuff that nobody wants to hear, but this is the kind of stuff that we talk to each other about.

Speaker 3:          00:18:53       Wow. And, and so, uh, and so like good. If you have a favorite coffee place where the baristas are like really good and they make the coffee taste really good, chances are they know about that extraction window and they're trying to get the coffee within that extraction window. So it tastes great if you exceed 22 percent, um, and something closer to 30 percent of the coffee is actually extractable, you could get 30 percent of the material out of the coffee if you want it, if you totally squeezed the sponge dry, but 18 to 22 percent is where it tastes good.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       WOw, that's crazy. It is. Now you jumped at the chance to pour this coffee and to brew this coffee or something. you didn't want us fucking it up? Well, yes. Well, it's true with good reason. Neither jamie nor I know what the fuck we're doing. Was like, he knows what he's talking about, the dive, I doubt it, trust me, he learned everything from me. We know a little bit, you know. Um, but when it comes to these sort of things like times of extraction and temperature, does it vary depending on what kind of coffee you have? like, so this is the ethiopian coffee, would you have a different if it was a jamaican? Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:20:02       IT absolutely does. And, and so when, um, when coffee pros sort of start to work with a coffee, we'll experiment with different temperatures, different kinds of extraction, different coarseness of grind to try to, to try to get it right, find the sweet spot. Yeah. We call it dialing it in. So if we're like, if, if a, if a, if you're with a group of coffee people and there's a new coffee, you'll ask somebody, did you dial it in? And that means that means did you get it tasting the way it should be tasting? Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:20:36       So what are the variables? Like what? Like, how much is the spectrum of variance between say what's like an extreme given extreme on each end of, of what? Of like brew times temperatures, what's the difference?

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       Okay. So every. There's a. FIrst of all, there's a lot of different types. Marley's yeah. Yeah. Stuff's delicious. Thank you. Um, there's a lot of different. Uh, I'm gonna have a little more to smell. Really unique. Yeah. It's really beautiful. Clean, clean, floral coffee. Yeah. It's so different. We usually have this a hawaiian stuff lately. Yeah. A Hawaii roasters drinking. That's really delicious. Cool. Yeah, this is, this is probably like the polar opposite of that actually. It's very different. Smells amazing. Yeah. That's the thing about this coffee is it's super fragrant. Yeah. In a very unusual way. Like it doesn't smell like coffee. It's almost like it's almost like tea. Exactly. right. And that's, I would describe this coffee is being t like. Yeah, it's really beautiful. And uh, so anyway, so there's all these different ways to brew coffee. So you've got a french press here, there's a pour over coffee drip coffee that you, certain things, but it was a little vacuum thing.

Speaker 3:          00:21:45       Uh, you might be talking about an era. Are those good? Yeah. Coffee people love them and each one of those has a different deal. So like in this french press, coffee will steep for awhile, sort of like tea and then you press it down and whatever. And how long do you usually steep it? four to six minutes is kind of a window. Really? Yeah. Know how does something like a clover work then? Because the clover, that crazy computerized coffee machine that cooked at very quickly, very quickly. Right? So the way that that works is it's designed to be able to have fine, finer coffee, you know, so um, uh, which changes the changes, the extraction surface area, right? If you, if you grind it really fine, then it can, it can brew, it can extract really quickly. so that's why like in an espresso machine, it's ground like to a powder.

Speaker 1:          00:22:35       Pull thAt video up of the clover machine, just so you can see what we're talking about. For folks who don't know, some genius guys who were coffee nerds. Sorry. Yeah, no vander nosler. He's like, yes, I'm a coffee nerd. I'm just under fdr, but from stanford university, and they figured out this machine which costs some upwards of $10,000 dollars. Yeah, like 11,000 bucks and I've never thought about buying one until I watched someone do it and use it, and I was like, oh, this might be the fucking coolest thing ever. Looked for a real coffee dork. And then I found out that starbucks bought them all those sons of bitches and I don't even see them. I never see them in a starbucks. Oh yeah, they have them, but they're not that. Well, starbucks should fucking sell them. I one of these for the office. Tell it to you. If they would, I would be totally willing to buy one of thoSe and just put it in this office.

Speaker 3:          00:23:23       I'll see if I can make that happen. Then it happened. The. Yeah, but I mean I used to have one in my office,

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       so this is incredibly variable. This thing, if you've never seen it, is this really beautifully constructed, it looks like a giant Piston, like a car engine piston and you pour coffee in it and the water in it and then you stir it with like a little whisk

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       and then dial in the coffee based on the known recipes for that

Speaker 3:          00:23:51       coffee. Right, exactly. and so. And it was made really fancy. You hear it? Yeah. It could communicate with other machines and you could send the recipe from one machine to another.

Speaker 5:          00:24:00       Oh, that's creepy. They're going to take over. Yeah. Coffee machine is going to take over and at the end it's really unusual. It leaves this hockey hockey puck of griNds at the top of the machine and then you have this squeegee which is kind of an elegant way to deal with that little problem of what do you do with the coffee grinds and they come off that piston yet, but it comes up like a cheeseburger. It's so weird looking burger, coffee, break, coffee, break out. We call it and then you slide it in with this little like gas station, windshield washer, squeegee thing. Yep. It's fucking bad ass.

Speaker 3:          00:24:31       Yeah. And so on the. So the reason that that can happen so quickly is because you can use fine coffee because it's got that hydraulic piston that sort of pushes it up that's incredibly strong. It's got these, these, this metal filter that the coffee grounds kind of sit on top of. And so it's a pressurized situation somewhere in the same realm as, as uh, the aircraft we were talking about something similar. And by the way, the aero press is essentially a home, you know, $50 version of that

Speaker 5:          00:25:09       and it's just as good and. Yeah. Alright, fuck the clover then jesus christ, we almost, we just saved ourselves 11 grand or whatever it is. Yeah. That was really designed for like a coffee service and bad ass though, man, of that kind of technology. The fact that they want to support them, they were willing to go out and invest the money to make something like that and design it.

Speaker 3:          00:25:28       Have you seen that? The steam punk, yet there's, okay, there's all these great coffee machines out there that pulled out of steam, pull it up. And, uh, and this is, uh, recently, uh, uh, designed machine and it's got, it's got these glass tubes and bubbles and you know, all this crazy shit. You're, you're, you're gonna love it. When, what is, what is the benefit of that machine? It's just another, um, it, it actually works on a very similar principle to all these things. Um, but they're, all coffee machines are designed to make it easier to do what I said before, the, the, uh, yeah, that's, that's it. That's the steam punk. So that's that. All each of those looks like a pirate chambers. Yeah. Each of those chambers brew coffee. Whoa. Um, and uh, now interestingly, you might get a computer, a computer screen. Yeah. It's. Yeah. And that computer screen is to dial in all these, all these variables, you know, so recently out of the clover. Too much pressure. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:26:36       That's a question that's like asking me what my favorite child is. Sorry, I probably can't play favorites. No, but it's right up there with clover. Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       How much has that been a thing? That's a good question. I don't know the answer to that. I would guess in the same sort of range, but, and all of these things. Now I'm going to tell you something else, which is these, these machines, all they do is make it easier to brew coffee like this. So you've got, you've got some pretty sophisticated equipment in your kitchen and this is all what he's doing right here. This was the right stuff. Wow. This is wild, man. This makes me feel like a scientist though. I'd like to have that. It's kind of laboratories. It was very mad scientists and so the water's boiling and one of them and then the coffees and the other one. Is that what's going on here? Well, the one in the middle is kind of getting ready. He's going to dump some coffee in there.

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       He's in the one on the right. It's already extracting the coffee and these little, those little up pistons are there to sort of be the filters of the coffee. It's a complicated machine. And I would say so a couple of weeks ago heRe in los angeles, there was a, uh, there was a battle between, um, a guy called nick show. Nick cho is the, is the guy who, he's one of the owners of this coffee company who arrested this coffee, we're drinking, and then the inventor of that machine, the, uh, the steam punk went head to head and had like a man versus machine kind of thing. And nick was just using very simple little brewer that he poured the water on, just totally manual. And then the other guy was, was, uh, was use manning the steam punk and they were like having this head to head where they each had to brew six different coffees for these three judges and they couldn't see what they were drinking all this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:28:21       And uh, now the, the. So the result was that the steam punk machine won by a hair. It was essentially a tie that the, uh, um, uh, and the point is that you can, you can make coffee delicious by being really good at mastering the variables, knowing what your, you're knowing what grind looks right, knowing how hot the water is, et cetera, or you can interest that stuff to a machine. And that's what machInes do. They just get the water right every time they get the, they get the, what we call the turbulence, like how much it gets stirred right. Every time. And if you can replicate something very precisely again and again and again, the coffee is going to be really good. I get a sense

Speaker 1:          00:29:03       though that you're a purist and the you prefer to use manual equipment. Almost like if you drove a car, you would want a manual gearbox. Are you that guy?

Speaker 3:          00:29:12       I am that guy. Well, I told, I told somebody. Somebody was interviewing me for something a while ago and I told them I don't own a coffee machine in my house and I don't that I have essentially the same setup that you have a water boiler that boils the water for me. A good grinder. I notice you have a good grinder in there. Um, and uh, some home style pouring, you know, I use a basically very cheap $30. Do you have a friend that I have a french press. I usually use paper filter though, just because I prefer the flavor.

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       Do you really? Yeah. Okay. that's an interesting thing to bring up because I'm. One of The things that I like about a french press is when you get that sort of bubbly surface and then when you pour it into a mug, you get kinda like a little phone like that. Do you still get that when you go through a paper filter? No,

Speaker 3:          00:30:00       that's exactly what it takes out. That seems like that's a good thing. It's good thing to you and that's great. so you know, you don't like it flavor, you know this. Okay. So we're tasting it now. can you taste in your mouth how you feel like there is? You can still taste the coffee a little bit. Yeah. And it'S coating your mouth, sort of like as if you just drank a glass of milk or something. Okay. So that's called body or after taste and after taste. Those, those are technical coffee tasting terms. Um, and so body is the feeling, the texture of the coffee in your mouth. And aftertaste is the flavor of the coffee that remains in your mouth once you're gone. Once it's gone. And aftertaste especially is really important because you drink coffee in the morning and you're driving to work. You still have that flavor of coffee in your mouth.

Speaker 3:          00:30:43       If that's good, then that's great. Then you get, you get an extra 20 minutes out of your cup of coffee. It's A bonus. If it's bad, if it's bad flavor and you feel like you need a mint, then that's like a bad after taste. And so you either. You're used to drinking good coffee. You like that feeling in your mouth. Do you like that flavor in your mouth? You like aftertaste. That's good. You're brewing coffee the right way. For me, I, I just tend to want to move on to the next flavor, whatever it is, whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       Oh, you're such a coffee geek. You want to geek out with a bunch of flavors in your mouth all day. Wow. You're taking it to a new level. You went with a paper filter just to remove aftertaste so you can move onto the next flavor. Couldn't you rinse it out with some seltzer or something like that? People do that. Yeah. Maybe some ginger like you do with sushi. Yeah. Would that work? I get. Yeah. I am. Blood palate cleanser. What? You could do power plans or do you have to brush your tongue or anything like that in between? People do. There are people that scrape the tongue. Man. I don't do any of that mess. That's the dark end of the pool. People Where you can't see the bottom. Yeah. Your coffee geeking out in the woods. Hardcore. Whatever. Yeah. So this is a very delicious coffee and you. One of the things that I noticed is that you, um, you serve it completely black. You don't fuck around wIth coffee filters or sugars,

Speaker 3:          00:32:01       but I mean genuinely coffee, coffee people don't judge people that, that do that. Everybody [inaudible] to me.

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       I appreciate that. That's really sweet. Do you put stuff in your coffee? Yeah, usually. Yeah. Usually we will. This is what I wanted you to try this. This is a coffee mixed with grass fed butter and mct oil. I found about this from getting familiar. Yeah. Yeah. This is Hawaii roasters, right? I'll just. Hawaii roasters, rusty, rusty, rusty. Rusty's hawaiian. And so, um, this, uh, I found out about this from this dude dave asprey, he calls it bulletproof coffee and apparently a guy named rob wolf, he was the first guy to figure it out. What it is, is coffee mixed with grass fed butter and mct oil and then it's blended. And the idea being that blending it all up like that has you get all the healthy fats, make steam with the caffeine is sort of a seat. Well, medium chain triglyceride oil, it's like palm oils and mostly coconut oils. You take the spinning in a centrifuge and extracted, I don't know the exact process, but it's essentially healthy fats and then it's all mixed with this. And the benefit of it is that because it's all connected to the fats, you get sort of a slow burn, a slow release. I get the impression from you though, that you fucking hopped up on coffee all day and a bunch of different kinds. You don't need no slow release. You just ride in that boat right into the rocks.

Speaker 3:          00:33:20       It's interesting. There was something you said earlier as we were getting started, you were talking about, oh, you were talking about the bars at the top of the show, you the meat bar or something like that?

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       Yeah, yeah, the warrior bar, right? The buffalo and cranberry.

Speaker 3:          00:33:35       So there's a story in coffee and uh, we don't know if it's it, if it's true or not, but this is the legend is that in ancient Ethiopia, the ethiopian warriors would take the fruits of the coffee. So coffee grows like a fruit. It's got, you may have seen pictures. It looks like a cherry. Yeah. And the two beans or like flat up against each other, like the pits of the cherry. But around that is like a fruit layer, like a sweet fruit layer. The fruit tastes sort of like, it's kind of slimy, but it tastes like a mix of a, of watermelon and jasmine. And then there's a kind of a tough leathery skin outside. And the legend says that the ethiopians would take that fruit and make a ball with a animal fat in some stories, say butter and other stories say like, like, uh, um, uh, like cow fat, and they would make balls out of them and put them in there.

Speaker 3:          00:34:34       They're a packs. And then just before a battle, these warriors would eat this, this like power bar thing, and it was like fat from the, from the, uh, from the animal fat to give you energy and, and kind of. And then the sugar from the coffee fruit to give that blast of energy. And then the caffeine together. Now some people say that this is like an invented story. Other people say that, that you had no, this is what the ancient ethiopians actually did before, before flight fighting a battle. What is known is that the engine ethiopians were known as, especially intense warriors.

Speaker 1:          00:35:12       How come nobody has recreated this? We need an on it coffee ball. We need to make that right away. That seems like something we need to.

Speaker 3:          00:35:19       But when he said, when you said coffee and butter, that's what I thought of is, is, is that kind of thing, these coffee balls with butter? Maybe. Maybe that's what they're trying to kind of recreate here. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:35:30       Well, um, this was, uh, apparently the original people have been putting, gee, you know, it had been putting that in coffee for a long.

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       But there was also like a yak t that uh, the himalayans used to tibetans used that was mixed with this yak butter and t to make this creamy sort of a concoction. I like what I like about the mixing it with the butter and mct oil is that it gives you like a long lasting effect of the caffeine. Your body has to break down all those fats and sort of blended in, connected with the caffeine. You don't get it as a big burst. Like I drank this stuff because I haven't drinking black coffee for a while and with, with nothing attached to it, it's just like, whew. It just goes right into your system. And you could, you could feel yourself like pepping up. Um, how do you avoid heart attacks?

Speaker 3:          00:36:15       It's interesting. Uh, I a, I don't,

Speaker 5:          00:36:19       don't worry about it. No, I'm just kidding obviously, but yeah, but you do get a rush from this. This is some strong caffeine coffee. This is some strong stuff. Yeah. I mean, I guess, I guess I don't look good way. I'm not criticizing. No, no, no. I know and it's really uniquely delicious. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm kinda shocked. My favorite coffee lately is this stuff called rusty's hawaiian. I've been drinkinG this a lot lately. Arrestees? Yeah. oh god. It's so good. Yeah. God, that stuff is good. I just, something I really love about coffee from the big island. I don't know what it is, but I had first tried hawaiian hawaiian roasters is the red bag that somebody told me about it. Like, dude, you got to try a hawaiian coffee. And so, uh, I got a hold this stuff a while back and it's my all time favorite coffee just has this like really sort of a um, a, a dark rich taste to it.

Speaker 5:          00:37:08       Very, very different from this stuff. This ethiopian stuff. Yeah. So different deal. If coffee started there, it started in Ethiopia. Is that now, did people take the plants and plant them in other places? Is that what happened? Yeah. So what happened was, so the ethiopians were the first ones to sort of discover coffee. This is what we have here, which we usually drink. That's my favorite. The one in the red bag. That's what is it called? It has a name though. It's like it says here, it says mocha peaberry from maui. Yeah. That's like a 94 on the coffee's so good man. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:37:41       But this is, this is part of the story I can tell you. I can. You were asking about coffee coming from Ethiopia, etc. Okay. So, um, uh, yeah. Okay. This is cool. They're really tiny, really tiny. And so, um, what happened was from the forests of Ethiopia, um, on the, on either side of what's called the rift valley, it's where it's, where the human species evolved. It's where we evolved over there and coffee have all been in the same place. So, uh, uh, which is crazy to begin with. And, and, uh, the ethiopians consumed it somehow. But then the, uh, somehow probably by the people on the other side of the red sea and what's now Yemen, which was then called arabia felix, this is like in, uh, about uh, 1100. They said they said, wait a second, we got some, some of the ethiopian slaves brought some coffee seeds over there and they started planting coffee in what's now Yemen. Um, and they started growing it and it turned into a big deal and they were the first ones that actually expoRted it out of the, out of the area. So, um, and the biggest, the port, the main port at that time in Yemen was called mocha. So

Speaker 4:          00:39:03       you've heard, you know, have a cafe mocha or coffee is called mocha mocha, mocha, java, all That stuff. That's all a reference to this one port in Yemen. It's still there. It's called alma alpaca. And, and, um, I thought mocha had something to do with chocolate. Yeah, we, we in the now in the states. Yeah, we kind of. Well, it's that people started adding chocolate to coffee that wasn't from there to try to make it taste like it was from there. So it had a natural chunk actually chocolatey taste to it. Can you still get coffee from you? It's very hard because it's Yemen, you know, it's crazy. And so yeah, it's a difficult place to do business and need to make friends with prince naseem. How mad do you remember that guy? No, he was a boxer from Yemen. He did a lot of wild shit. came in on a magic carpet. Oh, crazy. He used to dance around the ring. Yemen's an amazing place. I mean I've, I've never been there, but I've seen lots of pictures. I've known lots of yemeni people, but it's just politically politically dangerous. Volatile. But that's unfoRtunate. It sounds like it's something unique coffee out of there. But so, so anyway, so they brought, when they brought coffee for me,

Speaker 3:          00:40:10       Ethiopia tm and they brought only a few plants and then they use those to be the parents of all the, the, uh, the coffee in Yemen and that they were the ones that exported it anyway. Then, but then this is in history, they were Growing coffee, they were exporting it. Other people said, wait a second, we want end on this coffee deal because you're making money selling coffee, but they had a. They had a penalty of death if you got seeds, if you took seeds out of Yemen at that time, you got caught exporting fertile coffee seeds you can be put to death. It was that valuable, that valuable. That's incredible. And this is at a time where when like the english and the dutch were fighting over the dutch east indies as the spice islands, you know, people, all these, everybody was trying to get some colonies going to export these cash crops and they saw coffee as a potential cash crop. Some dutch spies successfully got some coffee out of Yemen and they planted it on and they had just won the war with the english over the dutch east indies and they planted the coffee that they stole from Yemen in what's now Indonesia on the island of java.

Speaker 4:          00:41:18       Wow. And they turned that they did great. They. They planned it. All these farms, they were producing coffee and that's why we still call it coffee java. Wow. So in mocha java, mocha java is in, you know, 150 years ago. those were the two places

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       that made most of the coffee in the world. The port of mocha in Yemen and the island of java in the dutch east indies.

Speaker 1:          00:41:41       Wow. And Ethiopia back then, like if that's where it all started from, they weren't exporting anything then they were just like letting it go.

Speaker 3:          00:41:49       It would juSt eat drinking it themselves. Wow. Yeah. And they, they didn't build an export market so. So then it gets weirder. You ready? Yeah. So, uh, the in the, at one point the dutch and the french signed a treaty and like, uh, you know, some sort of treaty and as a gift the dutch gave one coffee tree to the french, one coffee tree and the french in like, uh, in France they built a, a hot house like a greenhouse just to hold this plant. And it was the first, it was the first greenhouse in europe. The first greenhouse in europe was for a coffee. Right. And, and they planted other stuff there too, but this coffee plant was like really special and, and they used cuttings from that plant to plant. They wanted to plant some stuff in the west indies and the caribbean.

Speaker 3:          00:42:47       Um, they wanted to plant some coffee, the french did to for their colonies. And so this one guy named gabriela the clue he was responsible for bringing the coffee from France to martinique, but so he brought this one plant and he had it in a glass box, but they ran out of wind on the journey and the. So they were stuck in the middle of the atlantic ocean. Gabriela, the clue was sharing his water ration with this plant to keep it alive. Oh my god. He managed to keep it alive, planted it. And that one plant was the parent of most of the coffee in central America, south ameRica, etc. Holy shit. Yeah. So, so now there's a scientific impact to this because all the genetic diversity that was in Ethiopia, all the thousands of different coffee varieties that were in Ethiopia. Imagine how that got narrowed down from getting a brought from Ethiopia tm in the first place. Then whatever plants those dutch spies a stole to put the coffee in java. Then that one plant that went to a, that went to the new world that went to France first and then to the new world that's a, they call it a genetic bottleneck, so all the coffee outside of Ethiopia is kind of siblings to one another. That's incredible and that. And that's a problem for us because if there's a disease that, that one genetic variety of coffee is, is susceptible to, it can wipe out the whole coffee deal.

Speaker 1:          00:44:18       it's so incredible that one particular area of the world was the only place where this stuff was growing and now it's considered to be a completely worldwide beverage.

Speaker 3:          00:44:27       Yeah. Oh yeah. And the ethiopians are kind of, they're kind of pissed off about that. Seriously. If you go and you talked to them and they're like [inaudible], you know, everybody says they've identified coffee with columbia right now while fucking one. And they hate, they hate one valdez and epo. They're like, that's our thing. That's our thing that the world is getting richard. So, um, and, but that's right. I mean, that's true. If you go to Ethiopia, the different kinds of flavors that you can get in coffee from Ethiopia is crazy compared to any anywhere else I was saying was the genetic diversity genetic diversity thing each, each. Uh, each village in Ethiopia has their own variety of coffee that they grow traditionally. Wow. How many different varieties are there? Well, that's a good question. We don't know completely. They're still doing their scientists that are out in Ethiopia right now trying to count all the different coffee varieties. And the estimation is that there are somewhere between three and 5,000 different varieties of coffee growing wild in Ethiopia and outside of Ethiopia there was like 30. Why? Yeah. Wow. Yeah, it's, it's crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       That's nuts. So every legit coffee connoisseur is like a big fan of Ethiopia. Do you have like in Ethiopia tee shirt that you were in the spot? It's like brazilian jujitsu. Brazil is the spot, right? So you can pop up the origins center of origin, right? If you want to get into taekwondo, you go to Korea, right? Yeah. Wow. That's amazing man. So, um, this particular blend that we had is from Ethiopia and um, what are the variables in ethiopian coffees? Like what's, this is a, sorry, say the name again, how you said you're a good chef. You're a chef and a chef is a fruiTy floral one, but I would assume that with thousands of different varieties you get a broad spectrum of different flavors. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:46:19       So, so in, so, uh, just north of, of yoga chef is a kind of a larger area. And actually you're a chef is within an area called saddam is the name of the region and we call coffees from there, the dominoes dominoes are similar to [inaudible] but they're not as floral. They tend to be sweeter. They tasted like honey to me. So yeah, they have a honey, like,

Speaker 1:          00:46:44       like what's a good name for one if someone wants to try one of those sidamo any, any sit donald. And he spelled out house id. A, m o as any donald? No. Pretension. Damo,

Speaker 3:          00:46:54       yeah. Yeah. There's different ones that, that the, that names that you get besides sidamo will often be, um, uh, or even yoga chef will often be the specific name of a washing station will wash the coffee itself. And uh, and so you can get geeky about that. But sidamo is in what way? Well, you see people develop favorite,

Speaker 1:          00:47:15       favorite washing stations. Yeah. Yeah. And what's the variables in the washing process? Changes the way the flavor is. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:47:21       So, um, yeah. And then I noticed I listened to a podcast you did recently that had a nutritionist and you've been talking about washing, washed coffee being important. Yes. And I thought I could explain that process to you if you want me to. Yes, please. Okay. So it's all about how the, I told you that coffee beans are like two seeds inside of the cherry and you got to get that fruit off because if you don't get the fruit off it can mold and spoil and tastes yucky. So the whole challenge with coffee is to, is to do something with that fruit layer before it spoils. Okay. And like, because like any fruits of any kind of fruit, you pick it and then you either you either do. So whaT the ancient ethiopians did is they just picked it and they set it on the ground or on a mat to dry and the and the, and the, the, the coffee would sort of turn into shrivel up, turn into a raisin and once it was totally dry, they'd pound it in a mortar and pestle and the seeds that would separate from the dried up husk.

Speaker 3:          00:48:26       And then you could roast the seeds and drink the coffee. So, um, that was the original method of doing coffee, but when they moved coffee from Ethiopia, which is very warm and dry, and they could, they could grow it in Indonesia and in central America, but um, and it grow fine. But when they tried to dry it, it was tougher because there's more rain there, it's more humid and the coffee would mold and get musty and tastes crappy. So in sent in Costa Rica, they invented a different thing. And what they did was they ran it through a machine that would take strip off the, the, the, the leathery skin. Yeah, well the leathery skin, but it would leave this slimy fruit, you know, and it's sort of like, you know, if you eat a peach and some of the right, it sticks to the seed.

Speaker 3:          00:49:16       And that's exactly what happens to coffee. It's the sticky fruity stuff is sticking to the seed and you got to get it off. So what they did was they let it ferment for about a day. And if you let that stuff for men in a bucket or a whatever, a tUb for about a day, then it, it, it looSened itself through magic. It's like amaziNg. It's, it's, uh, the bacterial action and yeasts and stuff act on that stuff to dissolve it. And then you can wash it away with water, just rinses right off. That's wet process, that's wet processing. And then once that sticky, slimy, sugary stuff is rinsed away, then it's very easy to dry the coffee in the sun. It dries in a few days and then you can husk it and send it for roasting.

Speaker 1:          00:50:03       So there's a difference between drying it out and then roasting. It must be dried out first and then it must be roasted later. Right? Right.

Speaker 3:          00:50:11       So there's. Right. So in those two processes, those two major processes, or we call them either dry processing and wet processing or the natural method and the washed method, so washed and and wet processing the same thing

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       and dried and natural is the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:50:31       So. So in a certain way I'm changing climates and moving coffee plants to other geographic locations. Presented a lot of pretty unique challenges. Absolutely. For coffee they were doing in the 19th century it seems so different than anything else, which is also a fruit that you would grow me. You would just take it when it's ripe and you eat it when it's ripe, but this seems like a really complicated thing because what you're doing

Speaker 4:          00:50:53       student, I mean unlike most fruits, most fruits aren't cultivated for their seeds.

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       Is there outside of the seed, the isn't the abstract like the outside doesn't have some sort of nutritional benefit?

Speaker 4:          00:51:04       Sure. Well it's, I mean it's, it's a fruit, it's got sugar and it's got. What does it taste like? It tastes like I'm a. I always say it's like a mixture of, of watermelon and a jasmine real. Yeah, it's beautiful. It sounds delicious. Delicious. It's totally delicious. You can't just buy coffee fruit. Well you can. The problem is that if they. Coffee doesn't really grow around here. Right? So by the time they got it to you, it'd be spoiled. What do they do? Here's a few things for you and I should have brought some for you. They, they, some places they keep the fruit that they husk off and they drive that to a and you can make sort of like a beverage out of that by soaking that beverage in water, treating it like tea. And they do that in Ethiopia and in Yemen they call it has shara and Yemen.

Speaker 4:          00:51:51       They call it kesher. And in, in, I mean sharon, Ethiopia, Kenya and Yemen. And so it's another beverage that comes from coffee and it's sweet and it's got plenty of caffeine. Really? Yeah. And uh, and then more popular it seems like that'd be more popular. It's interesting. you would think that that would be maybe this new thing. It's kind of. Yeah. What do you call it again? Well, a lot of places that sell it here, call it c, a, s, c, a r a. That's the spanish word for it. Yeah. Scada that now. Is that what you said? Starbucks could start selling. They could, yeah. Why don't they do that? That's a good question. Fuck's wrong with you? Starbucks. Get on the ball. Then she bitches like money. But like there's some, there's other coffee companies sell it and it's good. Yeah. It's, it's kind of an, it's not satisfying in the same way that coffee is, it's kind of an oddity you'll, you'll try it. Yeah, I certainly will. Yeah. You tell me what that sounds interesting. Coskata. Okay. I gotta remember that now.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       The, the actual beiNg itself. Is there more caffeine in the fruity outer layer or is there more caffeine in the bean itself? I don't know

Speaker 4:          00:52:50       the answer to that. Okay. But there's theory and there's coffee. That's true. It varies. And the, and uh, there's caffeine in all parts of the, the coffee plant, the leaves, everything. Yeah. It's there and everybody even look like I don't even know what it looks. Um, it's about, well, it depends on the variety of coffee, but generally they're about eight feet tall at the bush. Yeah. All I know about that as now that I'm realizing it's fucking Juan Valdez, man. Juan valdez. The only why they did they really got attached to that burrow and him with his coffee beans. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. How odd now

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       is there a variation in the caffeine content of beans from one part of the world to the other? Because I've seen something called kicking horse that was called kicking horse coffee claims to have super excessive amount of caffeine.

Speaker 3:          00:53:41       Yeah, I, well, I don't know that brand, but what they might be talking about is there's another species of coffee. So I'm. so there's the species that we've been talking about from Ethiopia and all that stuff is called cafe. Arabica is the name of that spa. Okay. So theRe's another species that comes from the western part of africa and um, it's called cafe canephora, but we call it robust. Have you ever heard of her breasts? Okay. So robust. It comes from west africa. It doesn't taste as good generally. Um, it's uh, it, it's sort of my, in my experience, it tastes like burnt popcorn, you know, you know, cheap diner coffee has that burden, popcorn kind of taste to it. That's from the robust data in it.

Speaker 5:          00:54:23       And they've used burnt popcorn. Yeah. Rubber star diner in white plains, dr. Totally. I used to eat it this fucking place. Their coffee was just always like burnt popcorn. I didn't even thought of that, but it tasted like shit. Yeah. So that's the robusta in it. Never bust. That has a lot more caffeine than, than, than arabica does. No kidding. But it also has a bunch of other chemicals that don't taste very good. uh, so that's why it's got such a jolt to, it tastes like shit. So some

Speaker 3:          00:54:52       people I've seen people talk about high, you know, high caffeine coffee and they're just using robust enough to sort of, to sort of amp up the, the, uh, the, the caffeine level,

Speaker 5:          00:55:04       let's I think floating around. That's the scoop scoop. I didn't take it up and jamie were drinking plastic soup here. Um, the uh, but you know, I mean obviously caffeine is an important part of the deal without it the fit, let's be honest, this is a drug. The ride wouldn't be nearly as a line list nearly as long. It's true. Yeah. But, but

Speaker 3:          00:55:27       after that, once you've satisfied the caffeine, you know, part, um, you start drinking coffee for what it tastes like and so, and so people that are focused on coffee flavor tend to deemphasize the jolt part and, and emphasize

Speaker 5:          00:55:47       the flavor, the flavor part. What is the, the orange, why does the plant produce caffeine in the first place? Is that we know that? Yeah, it's an

Speaker 3:          00:55:54       called an alkaloid is the, is the, is the, uh, class of chemical. The caffeine is. And uh, and there's, in general, plants seem to, to produce alkaloids to drive away, um, predation. Yeah, like insects and stuff like that.

Speaker 5:          00:56:12       Okay. so the insects eat the coffee, have a fucking heart attack, follow scott that's toxIc to insects at a micro level. So the animals, a lot of animals as well. Right? But from what I understand, that's the reason why dogs don't like chocolate. We shouLd feed your dog chocolate.

Speaker 3:          00:56:27       It's another alkaloid called theobromine. So, um, so theobromine chocolate has and it's very similar to caffeine. It'll make you your heart. You know, and I talked to a veterinarian about this once and the problem with, with dogs is they eat a bunch of chocolate and their heart pounds so fast. They have a heart attack. Yeah. From the, from the, from the, uh, theobromine and it's like caffeine and in, you know, people say that, that uh, the chocolate has caffeine, that active thing is actually feel bromine, which is.

Speaker 5:          00:57:02       So it's an alkaloid, it's very similar. It's a stimulant that works on dogs in a different way that it works on humans. Yeah. Yeah. It's the dogs are more susceptible to it. That's fascinating because in humans it actually has some weird like representation of love. Right? It gives a very similar, if they say yeah. Yeah, just kind of makes sense. Right? They give chocolate to people.

Speaker 3:          00:57:21       Yeah. Then that's what they say. Yeah. I mean, my, myself, if I drink, if I eat too much chocolate, my heart pounds, I can feel it much, much more than.

Speaker 5:          00:57:30       Well, you're a hairy dude. You're probably much more animal. Like a. There was a recent article that I was reading today online about chocolate. That chocolate is going to be extremely rare in the future because of our, um, our overconsumption of chocolate. We consume so much chocolate. They can't keep up with the production. The demand can't keep up, keep up with the production

Speaker 3:          00:57:50       and they've got a similar product, project problem that coffee does. So, so genetic problem or genetic problem and, and uh, and the same. Okay. So chocolate is indigenous to south America. I'm like, coffee is indigenous to africa. A cacao is from latin America and uh, but then it's been spread all over the world has a narrow genetic base. I mean, all these tropical crops have these, have these problems. The other problem is climate change. Um, you know, as the climate gets warmer, these, the, the, the suitable kind of environment for these very climate, very temperature intolerant plants, narrows diseases spread more easily, etc. Etc. It's a problem

Speaker 5:          00:58:45       that is very interesting. So you said that coffee can't be grown in the United States?

Speaker 3:          00:58:50       Well, it can. Mainly. Hawaii is in the United States, in Hawaii. Um, there is also one farm here in California, really up in santa barbara. It's not far. You can drive here in santa barbara. Yeah. How's their coffee? Delicious. Real? Yeah. And heat. But he only planted this farm a few years ago. No shit. Yeah, it's called good land organics.

Speaker 5:          00:59:08       So he's the only guy in America and these growing coffee in the lower 48. Yeah. Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:59:12       And it's because he's in a very unique kind of microclimate there. There's actually, if you go to his farm, it can be warmer at night on this farm than it is during the day because of the weird way that the weather works around their santa barbara's paradise. It is, it's beautiful. It's amaZing. This place you should, you should go to this farm should. He also grows amazing fruits like, uh, these, these crazy australian lines called finger limes that are looked like caviar inside chair. A moya says. Have you ever heard of chairman? Yes, they are very rare. Tropical fruit. No. Never heard of that. Grows all these insane fruits. Wow.

Speaker 5:          00:59:45       What's the name of his place? Good land organics. That's pretty cool that he's the guy that, uh, figures out how to grow coffee autos. He has there. So there's a lot of avocados in santa barbara. So he, he,

Speaker 3:          00:59:58       he got this avocado. He's a, he's a guy from hearing it. I think it came from the here in la and he got into agriculture and he bought this farm that was an avocado farm. But then he started planting dragon fruit. These finger limes. I'm ciara moya is all this stuff and he grows coffee there. Um, and he just like a really good fruit grower and he grabbed his coffee and, and he, uh, uh, he was telling me recently he's, I mean, this coffee that he grew, he's planted the right varieties of coffee, including this one, the moca variety that has these little tiny beans. Um, he's got that growing there, etc. And it's just now coming into fruit. You know, one of the interesting things about coffee as you plant a coffee seed, you don't start to harvest coffee from between three and seven years after you planted. Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:00:49       So he's just now starting to reap the rewards of all these years and years of taking care of plants. That is fascinating. Yeah. Dude, you should grow coffee. You love it so much. Why are you not involved in growing it? Well, yeah, maybe someday spot in santa barbara, a small patch of land in santa barbara and let the party begin.

Speaker 3:          01:01:08       I would love it. I, I've, I've always traveled too much to like be at a, at a farm. So I mean, I've spent the last 15 or so years just traveling to coffee farms all over the world, working with coffee farmers to get their quality better and, and, uh, and kind of learn about all this stuff because that's kind of a new phenomenon to his, his coffee roasting companies that are interacting more directly with farmers and getting the, you know, getting the quality thing really worked out. UnderstandIng, um, what makes coffee grade. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:01:42       So most farmers that are growing coffee the, are they doing it just for a profit or there's other places where you go in there, real artisans. Is there a broad variation? It's mostly the first thing because most of the artisans. No, no, no, it's mostly businesses. It's mostly, well it's mostly the

Speaker 3:          01:01:59       small farmers struggling to get by. So, so going back to the history, so the dutch, you know, they planted their thing in java and they basically enslave the local population to work on their, on their coffee farms. This is in the, you know, in the 18th century, the, everybody was, all the european were trying to get colonies everywhere. So, you know, colonies, the spanish during their colonies in central America, the french doing their colonies. And in west africa, the english we're trying to colonize Kenya, the, the, uh, the, the dutch were colonized east India and they, they kind of enslaved the local population to grow coffee and, and, and so, uh, and so that was sort of a dark period in, in world history. And unfortunately coffee was part of that. But since then, so then, you know, the enlightenment happened. A democracies started to spread around the world, but still many of these countries that were former former colonies were, had poverty problems like central America and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          01:03:07       Um, the place that I started first started working with coffee farmers was in Nicaragua and in Nicaragua was formerly a colony, you know, and, and, and had that problem, but then they had the revolution. They, they, uh, they dissolved a lot of these big farms and gave little parcels of land to a lot of people that used to work on the farm. So here you have all these people that used to work on a farm that now have their little tiny farm of them have their own and that's cool because then they've got, you know, they've got their own business, their farm that's going. The problem is it's pretty tough in any country, whether it's the United States or Nicaragua or anywhere to make a small farm profitable. And so in many, many parts of the world, you've got small farmers that are just trying to get by, you know, and put food on their plate. And so one of the, one of the great things that coffee that special coffee companies can do is get engaged with those farmers and try to get the, the, celebrate the product, get people to pay more for it because it tastes really delicious and it becomes a better livelihood for farmers all, uh, all across the world.

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       So your friend in santa barbara, what was his name again that owns this place? J rescue is his. And what's the name of the place again? Good land organics. And so he's just a guy who loves coffee and decides I'm going to try to grow some stuff in santa barbara. It's growing. He's, he loves agriculture growing. And he thought it was a challenge to grow coffee, I think. I think he loves coffee too, but I think really he loved the fact that it was a challenge to the likes, these unusual fruits. So it kind of takes a person with a sort of a deep commitment to, to make something like this take place. Otherwise it's a pretty significant investment in time and effort before you reap any rewards. And there are those people

Speaker 3:          01:04:54       two in coffee. I mean even in, you know, in, in, uh, El Salvador and Guatemala. I'm in Panama in Brazil. I know if I know of like amazing farmers and all of these places who are like focused on like making the best imaginable coffee.

Speaker 1:          01:05:12       So now when you work with these people, say if somebody contacts you and say, peter, I know what the fuck I'm doing.

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       Come down here and help me grow some bitch and coffee. Yeah. What is your process like? Let's say a guy from Hawaii calls you up, says, I want to grow some coffee. I don't know what I'm doing.

Speaker 3:          01:05:28       Yeah, well coffee is kind of an unusual. I mean, Hawaii is kind of an unusual situation because the university of Hawaii is involved and they can actually call it the university of Hawaii and get. So they wouldn't, they wouldn't need me.

Speaker 5:          01:05:38       Okay. So where would they need you at south America? Peru. busted for cocaine

Speaker 3:          01:05:46       the first. Yeah. And Peru. I've done a lot of work in Peru and Bolivia and, and uh, and not just me. I mean there's lots of choice. Lots of, of people out there and, and, and in fact that the us government through usa id is out there trying to give a, give good support to these guys. The first thing you do is you teAch, teach them to taste coffee and amazingly, and some of your listeners may may have had this experience. I've had this experience. You go to wherever and Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Peru or whatever place that's famous for its coffee and you go into the hotel and they've got nice cafe and the instant coffee in the restaurant or whatever. And it's because a lot of these places, people don't drink the coffee, they grow the coffee, but they don't drink it.

Speaker 5:          01:06:33       And it's crazy. That's so weird. totally weird. How's that happen? Because it's more valuable to export so they don't drink it just because it's not worth it. It's worth it. That's part of the culture that's interesting now. So not part of the culture yet. It is, it is. It's part of the agricultural culture, but it's not part of the consumption culture.

Speaker 3:          01:06:51       It's weird. Okay. A Ethiopia is the only place in Brazil to some extent, um, where they drink coffee as much as they, as they, as they exit

Speaker 5:          01:07:01       47. Brazil has the same issue. The rest of south America where they have a very limited genetics. And is that the same or different? Because Brazil is so much bigger, but they're more than one variety from Russia in general. But um, and, and all of these countries, by the way, are aware of this problem and they're trying to diversify their genetics. So do they contact you through the coffee website? Is specialty coffee association of America

Speaker 3:          01:07:27       in the, in the, uh, yeah, so in the, uh, about starting in 2000 or so we, we, uh, we in our group that were affiliated with, called the coffee quality institute, put had this program called coffee core. It's sorta like the peace corps for coffee people and guys like me would, would, uh, would sign up and volunteer for two weeks to serve in a coffee farming community. And if we had a skiLL, we might have marketing skill or, or, uh, aCcounting or tasting. My, my Skill was tasting. So I would go down, I would teach a coffee cooperative in El Salvador. Do you speak spanish? yes. Oh, okay. How to taste their coffee and taste it like we do, you know, look for things like sweetness and flavor and aroma and stuff like that. And just that is like extremely powerful because if you're running a coffee farm and you and you know how to taste it, like your buyer is going to taste it and then you can say, all right, this case, it's better. I'm going To do this, I'm going to grow it this way, I'm going to dry it this way, I'm going to ferment it this way, etc.

Speaker 1:          01:08:37       Now when you say grow it this way, what are the variables involved in changing the flavor of coffee? Is it just climate or is it the soil content or is it something that you add to the soil the way you water them? What do you do? Well, most of them

Speaker 3:          01:08:49       biggest thing is the climate and a lot of that is determined by altitudes. So remember mrs. Mrs. Owen on folgers. What was the lady? I don't know. Anyway, I'm a commercial. She used to say mountain grown folgers. Oh that's right. Yeah. So, uh, and That's because coffee likes to be at high altitudes. So in general, the higher the altitude the farm is, the better the coffee and then. But a farmer has no control over the altitude of their, their farm, but what they can control is how much shade that the, uh, the coffee gets. So they plant trees next to the coffee to actually provide some shade for it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:25       Really. So they have coffee and they're like oak trees or some shit. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:09:29       Yeah. Usually it's a different. They're different. They're like latin american indigenous,

Speaker 1:          01:09:34       something that large leaves shady.

Speaker 3:          01:09:36       Yeah. And, and, uh, and sometimes it's a fruit tree so they can get fruit as well from the or other j is avocados in, in, uh, in santa barbara for this.

Speaker 1:          01:09:47       Wow. Okay. So he grows his avocado trees and then sandwiches them inbetween. Yeah, exactly. So,

Speaker 3:          01:09:52       so the deal is the coffee now a shaded coffee. So coffee evolved under other trees. It's called an understory shrub. It, it, it naturally likes to be protected by the trees. However, if you take it out and put it in the full sun, it will be more productive. It'll produce a lot more coffee. But in general that coffee won't be as good. So if a farmer has to like figure out the benefit, you know, it it, if he puts it in shade, the coffee will taste better, but it won't be as productive. So he has to sort of balance and that's, that's what happens in coffee all the time, you know, it's like the better you make it taste, the less there is of it kind of thing. And so a farmer is always trying to make that balancing act between having this far and be more productive versus having the quality

Speaker 1:          01:10:42       I hire. What is the ultimate taste expression? What is the move to get? Forget about no money involved. No, no financial reward. You're only trying to achieve the greatest taste ever. What's, what's the way to do that?

Speaker 3:          01:10:56       Start with a variety of coffee that's known for being really good tasting. So there's these different varieties of coffee that we talked about. Some of them tastes really good, some of them maybe are more disease resistant and don't taste as good because of that. So you choose a good, a good

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       variety to start with. The disease resistant coffees don't taste as good as the thing. And what diseases specifically is it getting there is a disease in and you may have heard about it in the news. It's actually a big deal right now. It's called coffee rust and it's a fungal disease that it makes the coffee leaves, get this powder on them that looked exactly like rust makes all the leaves fall off and the coffee plant. So is it similar to like, what's going on? Like, like, um, what is that disease that was hitting? Oh no, that was the bark beetle. I was thinking of a bug. But it's like that in that, in that, uh, you know, these, these crops can be susceptible, particularly if there's a narrow genetic we were talking about and what, what specific? Where's this coffee? Rust, like what is the, uh, is it all over the world or is.

Speaker 4:          01:12:01       Yeah, it's all over the world except it doesn't occur really in, in Ethiopia. So there's some sort of natural control happening in Ethiopia that seems to be the motherland, is that like. So if you're a real coffee dork, you're going all due respect. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that in a good way. I get it, if you're a real coffee connoisseur, Ethiopia is the spot. That's where you want to get your coffee. This for the strongest flavors, the widest variety of flavor and because it's the, oh gee, I think so. You know, but then you know, not to qualify that too much. I mean there's amazing coffees from central America. Colombia has some of the most incredible coffees and they're very different. Crazy diversity. Yeah. In Hawaii, like I said, I really enjoy a coffee from Hawaii. It just seems to me to have a very different taste as well.

Speaker 4:          01:12:49       What causes that? Is it the volcanic ground and be a. And then coffee's within Hawaii too can taste very different. There's a, there's a, uh, this is a maui coffee and I usually like to kona coffees. Yeah. Kona is the most well known area on the, it's on the big island, you know, um, and then it's got altitude. you can, once you go up that mountain, that's the biggest challenge in, uh, in Hawaii. I used to know some people that managed the coffee farm in molokai, which is a smaller island, not as much altitude. The coffee wasn't as good, so that's interesting. Yeah. There's a place in, in, in Hawaii and on the big island called mountain thunder. Have you ever heard of this thing? No. Great. Great coffee from mountain thunder from the big island, the big island. Really delicious. I'll get in there.

Speaker 4:          01:13:33       Yeah. But anyway. Um, but in general coffees from islands, like a, like a Hawaii, Jamaica, places like this, they've got a kind of a unique characteristic. You mighT like coffee from, uh, from Indonesia, from papa new Guinea. And this stuff has four stars. yeah. Uh, Indonesia and papa new Guinea. You know, I, I really enjoy coffee, but until this conversation I was a full. Yeah. Well, you know, fool. I knew nothing. I relied on too many unscrupulous people to fill my head with useless information. This is what we do in coffee people. This is what we do. We get dial in to what people like

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       and, and you know, show them other options if they want.

Speaker 5:          01:14:16       So to continue what I was asking you before, say if someone contacted you from Let's say somewhere in south America and they wanted you to go over there and hey, we need to fix our flavor profile, what would you do besides planting trees? Step one is start tasting the coffee themselves and, and how can you, how can you change that taste?

Speaker 3:          01:14:36       Well, okay. So you can either shade the coffee or not. You can, you can, you can. One easy way that a farmer can change the quality of their coffee is how ripe it gets. So as coffee gets riper, it gets sweeter obviously, but you don't want it to be too sweet or else it'll get like overly sweet. And also we'll get this kind of rotten character. So figuring out dialing. And there was a farmer I worked with in El Salvador, um, uh, who like got super focused on how ripe she was going to pick her coffee and she wind up figuring out this is good. This is geeky and amaZing is that if she let the coffee get half of the coffee you get to get ripe to where it was, the color of blood, uh, or I'm sorry, of wine, right? Like burgundy color, and then half of the coffee cherries get to where they were. The color of blood, like bright red like this. Um, and blended those together. It was the perfect flavor.

Speaker 5:          01:15:35       wow. What a dork. And she dialed in, but she's famous.

Speaker 3:          01:15:39       They did a, uh, a uh, uh, her name is aida by eight. They did a, uh, a piece on her in the new yorker a couple years ago because she's become the rockstar of, in the coffee world.

Speaker 5:          01:15:49       That's so fascinating to me. Like I said, when you sat down, I love people that are really industry. When someone gets really into something as you are in a coffee, it's very infectious. Like, you know, I want to like start trying all these different flavors now, but I don't want to be hopped up out of my fucking mind on caffeine all day. Well, you don't have to drink that much either. I mean, it's like, you know, I've already drank five cups of this space it out a little bit, but it's really good, but if you go to a coffee shop all the time, they can blow your mind with a different flavor of all times. How do you feel about a place like a chain, like a big chain? We don't even have to mention any names, but one of those big chains that cells sort of generic coffee like does that. you're talking about starbucks. I am talking about starbucks. Does that make you sad when you see these fucking things are popping up all over the place now?

Speaker 3:          01:16:36       Well, let me tell you a story. So I started in coffee in san diego. I was running a coffee shop in the. I started in [inaudible] 87. Right. So I was a barista in the early nineties and stuff and in 1994 we're running this coffee shop in san diego and we got word that starbucks was going to start opening stores in san diego and everybody freaked out like, oh my god, we're done. We might as well, you know, they're going to. They're going to drive us into the ground that the year that starbucks showed up, um, was the busiest year that we had and every year after that got busier and the great. So the great thing that starbucks has done and starbucks is, you know, they, they started in the seventies in seattle, a bunch of guys that really liked coffee and they just, they just figured out how to grow this business. Um, uh, they taught in many ways. They taught the world how to drink coffee.

Speaker 1:          01:17:29       They taught the world to drink coffee in many ways. When I was a kid, we used to drink coffee in the morning, like before I would go to work or you know, like um, guys would go to dunkin donuts and I was working on construction job sites. Guys are good at dunkin donuts or bring back coffees for everybody. Yeah. But there was no, like going to a coffee shop and buying a coffee in the middle of the day. That Sort of starbucks shifted people's mentality, shifted their behavior to shit. Like brian, like he's, oh, the guy was here earlier. It was always gotta fucking venti coffee in his hand where he goes, he's got to starbucks.

Speaker 3:          01:18:02       That's right. And so and so, and that's important, you know, so, uh, they've, you know, they've grown and gotten very ubiquitous and stuff. They've got shops all over the place, but it's not that delicious. It's not the best stuff. It's, well, I mean,

Speaker 1:          01:18:19       you know, I know you're trying to be nice. I don't want to accuse anybody of anything but okay, let me put it this way in a very nice way. Instead of saying something negative about them, which I use all the time. By the way, I'm not going to starbucks hater. I, I buy starbucks all the time. I have no problem with it. And um, if you were going to look for a very specific, very gourmet type of coffee, that's not where you would go.

Speaker 3:          01:18:43       I'm not a bad cup of coffee, not a bad cup of coffee. But if you want to go really, you want to have some of this stuff and have it this way, I wouldn't go to a starbucks store because that's not what they're doing. They're bringing coffee to the people, they're bringing back up pike's peak and maybe a dark roast. And that's it. And I will say though that I've tasted, I've been to starbucks where they blow, you know, whether they've got access to awesome coffees and they do have that. They do do that. It's not in every store, kind of. Right, right. You know, we'll have the clovers now. Uh, yeah. They've got the clovers, they never seen one In a starbucks. Yeah. They've got them in special stores in and uh, and that's another thing that they're doing. They're starting to, uh, you may have seen it in the news.

Speaker 3:          01:19:23       They're designing different stores that do different things and, and they're, they're, you know, they're, they're, they're a specialty coffee company that's doing their thing and they do have a wide variety when you bought bags. Yeah. Got, like limited small lot stuff that they do. And how should you store coffee? We put it in the freezers that bad. Uh, it depends. Uh, it can be bad, it can be bad, it can be bad if your freezer stinks and you don't, you know, you don't seal the bag up well enough. No, we don't have a stinky freezers then you're good. we don't ever put anything in there. But coffee. Yeah. One. And the other problem is like right now we took the, we took the coffee out and it got him to room temperature and you take it like if you take a coffee mug that's in the freezer out, you put it in your thing, it gets All wet on the

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       outside. Right. Then you've got that problem, you know, in general we don't tell people. We generally encourage people not to put it in the freezer just and just drink it fast. Okay. So I will say that if I was on, if I was in Alaska or something, you know, and I could only get a shipment of coffee once every six months, I would freeze it. Oh, okay. But, but ideal, I don't. Okay. Yeah, it's not ideal. So you should essentially, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you should essentially do it almost like you buy vegetables so you shouldn't. exactly. I always say like you buy bread so you should get it and between the time that it's dried and between the time that it's roasted and then you drink it, how much time should it take place between the time it's roasted and the time you drink it?

Speaker 4:          01:20:48       So the dry, it's essentially, it's good for how long. Once it's drawn, once it's dried and in Nicaragua or whatever, then it's usually good for about a year, a year. And that's good because it's about once a year, you know, coffee, coffee harvest happens once a year. They dry it all, they get it together, they stabilize it by drying and then they ship it to roasters in the us. Okay. So assuming you're in the correct window then once you get it to a roaster, uh, how long after it's roasted, should you drink it and does it matter or should you brew it and does it matter how it's stored? Then? Usually the window after roasting is about two weeks, two weeks only. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Like bread. Wow. You know, that's crazy. And, and really should roast to order. Yeah. And, and so that's why, you know, a good that's interested in coffee roasting company.

Speaker 4:          01:21:39       We have some old coffee. We should just throw it away. Yeah, there's no point. Just get some new coffee. But I'm like this one, it says, it says when it was roasted. Yeah, right there. Yeah. So that's a, that's a uh, that's a good sign when a, when a roaster cares enough to like put the roasting date on there. This shit was roasted just a couple of days ago. Yeah, that's how you do it. Huh? And this is from wrecking ball wrecking ball. Whereas this company in san francisco, san francisco is awesome. Yeah, of course they would have something like this there. Yeah. And the uh, the uh, it's kind of a cool company to that. The, a couple owns this company, she's like a kind of a legendary roaster. She's been in coffee for a long time and uh, and he is like a pretty famous barista guy and they got together and they've got kind of the, the, they're kind of a power couple in coffee.

Speaker 4:          01:22:29       That sounds amazing. Yeah. They're breaking ball coffee. All right. I'm going to buy some of this. You can buy it online. And so when you buy it online, do they roast it when you order it? Yeah, a good coffee coffee company will do that. They'll sort of collect the orders and then and then do a roasting day and send it out all out. I have time she'd get it the day after it was my friend has a coffee company called caveman coffee and when you order it from caveman coffee.com or whatever the fuck it is, they, they roast it as you or that's cool. That's the only way to do it. Right. Very cool. And they should probably start including roasted on dance. Huh? They don't have roasted on dates, but that shit sounds like it's important. Sure. well, I mean if you're the bag or something,

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       I was making a decision about what coffee to bring you today that made a difference. Dude, you knocked it out of the park because this is a unique flavor and it's, it's different. It's unique and weird. Uh, unexpected way. You know, I really, really like it. I love the smell of it too, man. What are the beans smell like? Did they have a unique smell? So you should get a little bit of a whiff of that, of that, a low of that lemonade, jasmine kind of thing. Why don't they make sense out of this shit? I know, right? Smell so good. You know, I used to, one time I had to, I had to work with an airline to try to get their coffee tasting better up there. They. And how did you do that? And you go, I didn't. It wasn't that successful in this.

Speaker 5:          01:23:47       In this particular case, it wasn't that successful, but with all the flight attendants were doing is they were taking the coffee bags and they're putting it in the bathroom to make it smell a little bit better in there. That was the best thing that they couLd do with this. Oh, so you just used it as coffee popery yeah, exactLy. That's interesting. Well, that's kind of a good move beCause when you smell, even if it's crap coffee, you know, when you smell the grinds, it smells good. You can open up a folgers and get it out. That's folgers is crap, but you get that, that smell of non roasted the coffee. It's delicious. It's like so people, human beings like the smell of brown things, you know. Have you noticed at all brown things? Yeah, but like, you know, toasts. Yes. One of the greatest smells ever eat steak.

Speaker 5:          01:24:31       Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Good point. Bread, baking all these chocolate. We love things that are a little bit right. Yeah. This brown, the column browning reactions in science, you know, and when he turns food brown, it tastes good. It certainlY does. It's fascinating thing. Like try eating a piece of raw steak. Yeah, it really doesn't have that, that great. The best flavor to it, but god damn when it's got that crust on the outside of it and you cut through it and. Yeah. Delicious. Yeah. I am a fan of tastes and flavors and I think it's sort of an unsung art form that people have figured out how to cultivate different tastes and flavors and all sorts of foods and I'm in in cooking. I became a big fan of cooking. I can't. I don't really cook very well, but I became a big fan of the art form of cooking very well when I started watching anthony bourdain's no reservations show and then and becoming friends with him and getting to know him and talking to him about chefs and going to a restaurant with him, which is what was one of the coolest fucking experiences of all time is amazing.

Speaker 5:          01:25:32       It's like, you know, playing basketball with Michael Jordan or soda and you're hanging out at a restaurant with anthony bourdain. Totally. But he, you. I developed a respect for the art form from him, from watching his show, the art form of cooking, and then I started considering it in a different light instead of thinking like, oh, it's nice when people cook good food. Oh, that tastes good. I want to eat there instead. I started thinking of it as art is artwork right now. No different than a song. No different than a standup comedy sketch or you know, or a cup of coffee. Right? The, the,

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       the, the art in the creative, the creative. Literally creative because you're creating. I mean, you're growing and you're, you're, you're influencing the actual finished product. Yeah. It's sort of an overlooked aspect of creativity, isn't it?

Speaker 3:          01:26:18       Yeah, absolutely. It totally is. And, and people, it's nice to hear you talking like that because guys in coffee, if we start to talk about how we think of coffee as an art form, a lot of times people are like, ah, come on, you.

Speaker 1:          01:26:31       People are always looking to call bullshit man. People call bullshit too much. It's true. It's good thing to call bullshit because there's a lot of bullshit out there, but it's not a good thing to call bullshit about people's passions. I think it's more interesting to observe those passions and try to find out what it is and if I looked at it on a surface level and I wasn't really into flavors and I didn't have that sort of transition in the way I thought about flavors because of cooking, I probably wouldn't think about it that much either. But when I sit down and talk to a guy like you who obviously is dedicated, incredible amount of time to this passion, then that's when it becomes infectious. You kind of understand it.

Speaker 3:          01:27:06       Yeah, it's true. So, um, and that's the way I, you know, I, and a lot of my colleagues think about it is, is like how can we make the flavor just kind of stopped people in their tracks? How can we use coffee and like. So like for me, I kind of mentioned this before, when you're in, when you're a coffee person, when you're a barista, you're interacting with people at like this really delicate point in their day, you know, they don't know what's going on. They're coming to your coffee bar. They, you're usually the first person they've seen other than their wife or whatever and uh, and they're, they're not sure what kind of day they're having. And then if you give them something that's sort of like, tastes really good, it makes them feel good. It's like a great thing and if you. And if you do that for people a lot, you know, you feel like you're doing something positive for the world. So I always get really focused on these things.

Speaker 1:          01:27:58       Sure. I mean, you certainly do, you know what I mean? I think that anytime you can inspire someone to, you know, you can inspire someone with your passion for something I'm in. I'm constantly inspired by things that I don't want to have anything to do with. You know, like there's people that inspire me. Like I watched that movie, jiro dreams of sushi. I don't want to make sushi or you know, I really don't want to eat a. I certainly do. I was thinking literally thinking about flying to Japan. Yeah, and booking a reservation. I was going to try to see if I really should call David Lee roth who lives in Japan and in Japan. Fuck jay. Does David Lee roth lives in Japan and practice sword fighting all day. David lee ross, one of the greatest bad motherfuckers to ever walk the face of the planet. Guy walks around and overhauls gives zero fucks.

Speaker 1:          01:28:46       He's in his sixties and still doing new things and challenging himself. He lives in fucking Japan in tokyo with his dog. He has an apartment that's fucking David Lee roth man. He's a David Lee roth and he's got an apartment like a normal person with a dog in tokyo. He's. He's incredible. Well, if you do that, if you go to Japan to. There he is. He's such a cool guy. We allowed him to wear sunglasses indoors. I didn't shit on him while we were taking that photo. That's an old school thing. I thought those, those old school rock stars, they still wear sunglasses indoors and we let them get away with it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:25       Um, but if you do that, if you go visit jiro, let me know and I'll, I'll send you some coffee places that are sort of the equivalent of that. Ah, in Japan, Japan. Really. So these coffee guys. So in many ways Japan, there's a concept in japanese called coda and that is like practice, practice, practice until you're the best in the world and keep practicing and keep getting it wrong, but you're going to get better all the time. You know, and it's, it's evident in martial arts, it's evident in jiro dreams of sushi. Right? And so he's like, focus

Speaker 1:          01:29:58       was what they were calling each other. Was that the phrase? This phrase? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:30:02       Yeah. And uh, and this exists for coffee to this, this idea of getting it perfect. There's this one coffee Place I went to last time. I was in Japan that would blow your mind. It's this guy that's like super. He has this coffee equipment. I walked in, my wife, uh, she actually found out about this place from a japanese friend of hers. We walk into this place and he's got all this crazy equipment like, like you'd like it. It's like, it's like weird weirdly excessive coffee equipment. I'm saying what is going on? And also in this place, this guy has stereo equipment, these giant speakers playing, uh, playing like perfect the and the incredible turntable and all this stuff playing like perfect classical music and he's serving. His goal is to serve you the perfect coffee while you're listening to the perfect music and it's like a crazy library and this guy takes five minutes to make you a cup of coffee.

Speaker 3:          01:31:02       Whoa. Um, but along it, well, he's just like practice. He's getting it right. You know, he's, he's nailing it. He'll throw stuff away if it's not perfect. And how will we know if it's perfect? Well, it's like judo man. It's like he's just trying to get to the ultimate coffee experience. There's another guy named katsu. He's got a place called bear pond espresso and he learned about coffee in New York and so he's trying to bring the New York city coffee experience to, to central tokyo, you know, and he's got this little place. He, he, this guy, he, he shows up to his shop like an hour and a half before they open these spins, that hour and a half, making his coffee taste right and taste it, throw it away, adjust. Tasted again. You know. And if it's not right, he doesn't open. There is. Yeah. That's, that's, that's katsu man. God damn. That place is awesome. And that's in tokyo. That guy is a bad ass. He sounds like a, he is a coffee bad ass. And him and

Speaker 4:          01:31:59       his wife, that's all, you know as a tiny little place you go in there if it's not open it's because he's trying to get the coffee right. and uh, you just wait and then you go in there and he makes you awesome coffee. Did you go there? Oh yeah. You fly there just to drink off? No, but I was there for it, but I definitely made it make a trip. Every time I'm in tokyo I go to visit katsu. He's the man, so he rides around on a motorcycle and I'd never seen that before. Oh yeah. That's his place. It just jumped off a motorcycle. Yeah. Yeah. He's a bad ass now. Are they places like that here and you find that on vimeo there's a whole, like three minute documentary about. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:32:36       Say the name of the documentary so folks could watch it if they want to. Uh, I think it's just bare pond espresso. Bear upon his press. What other spots like that in los angeles or they're really, really exceptionally good coffee spots.

Speaker 4:          01:32:48       Yeah. So the place I actually bought that for you here locally in a, in a shop in culver city called kronos, anti c o g n o s c e n t I cognizant. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:33:01       Yeah. Cognitive study. Which means those in the know. There you go. Yeah. There's a queue. That's a pool cue. I play pool. There's a pool cue called the cognizant and by my friend joe gold. He designed this show gold. Well, it's a very common name. Yeah, but he's a. He lives in chicago. Okay. One of the best pool cue manufacturers are artists I should say in the world. Cool. Yeah, and the cognitive one. Yeah, and he had them designed based on. He hired these engineers to figure out what was the exact perfect taper and the right combinations of woods, like mostly uses ebony. He used all kinds of different Woods, but most of the time he uses ebony with a maple shaft and certain woolman dried aged wood because the wood has to be dry. They can camp any water in the water, a little move as it dries and it changes, so they have to cut the wood down.

Speaker 1:          01:33:51       He starts out in a big block and you slowly cut it down over long periods of time until it becomes a doll. He could make a qwiff because you have to allow for the wood to move as it dries. Second guitar maker. It's very, very similar and there's. There's a big difference amongst pool players in woods and how they perform on a table. If they have a different, like a maple, a forearm of the queue. There's a joint in most cues and then the shaft is almost always maple. The maple forum will be very Different than a coco bolo for like a springiness. Yes, yes. There's maple is a little bit more gentle and forgiving and a cocoa elbows a little more dense than ebony is denser. Still having also is heavier so it has like a more forward balance to it. The middle of the queue will hold a lot of weight, so sometimes people who prefer a maple queue, we'll go with the steel joint.

Speaker 1:          01:34:37       So the steel in the middle sort of access like a pendulum because the weight is forward on the queue. Like the balance of the cubes is very important, but it's also an artist in thing. It's like it's just like this coffee thing and a lot of ways is the people that are really into it are really into it and they, you know, the guys who make pool cues, like there's they're artists and they're doing a lot of, especially guys like joe gold do it on a very high end level. They're making a functional piece of art. It's very beautiful to look at as well. Yeah. This is joe's work here. These are like really super fancy ones. Were you seeing the end lazy bottom and these. I dOn't know whether he's going to have a wrap on. These are what sometimes they make some with no rap, meaning they'll know leather around the handle and some people prefer leather around the handle. There's a whole art to that too, I think. Yeah, I'm unbelievably fascinated by that as well, but like I said, I'm in anything like a guitar makers. I don't play guitar, but I watched a documentary on how a guy makes a guitar. I think I watched a whole documentary on a mongolian bowmaker last night because making traditional mongolian like recurve bows, you guys doing it at all these different woods and using animal horns and seeing you and It will glue that they make from from fish. I'd so much rather

Speaker 3:          01:35:51       pay my money for something that is like handmade.

Speaker 1:          01:35:54       Yeah. It means that their soul into it. Yeah, it does. It means something. It turns in our normal artifact into something really special. Yeah. It's functional and you also get a feeling from using that thing. You know, whether it is a handmade knife that you're chopping up food within your kitchen. You know that somewhere in brooklyn, the guy you know works in a shop that cuts that metal and polishes it down and sharpens it up and then sends it to you and you're, you're receiving a labor of love. You know, you're. Yeah. You're, you're receiving the fruits of someone's creativity. There's something about, yeah, handmade, stuff like that. Well, something about us human beings that we really appreciate other people's effort work. That's why you want to have someone's artwork on your wall. You know, what's, why you want to, a piece of furniture that someone made. It's like there's something uniquely satisfying instead of like something at ikea that's just like some form block thing that's made in a factory and it's totally true and spit out. But if you could buy a couch that Some guy actually carve the wood and, and, and planted the or put the cushions in place and you know, embroidered it all and oh my god, that'd be amazing. You get excited about it when you sit in it and you're sitting in someone's work. Totally. So anyway, you guys places

Speaker 3:          01:37:08       one, the chi is, he's the guy who was an architect but got turned on to cough

Speaker 1:          01:37:13       and this is in culver city is the city. Yeah. So cognizant, any coffee, there you go, there you go. And then another great place and yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:37:20       in la that I like a lot, um, is it's called g and b coffee. these guys, uh, uh, charles babinski and kyle glanville got together. Then they're the gnb and uh, and they put together a coffee program. Amazing downtown la. Their shop is. And uh, um, charles is the current reigning. Okay. Do you know we have champions like barista champion?

Speaker 1:          01:37:48       We've met a contest of champions. Yeah. Yeah. What do they do? Like crossfit? no, we, it's like a coffee. Anybody ever breached

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       until they died because that. Has anybody ever breached it to like John Henry just like dropped from. Yeah. Well like, you know, they have contests to see if people can do things for $20 a day. I like an endurance thing. Yeah. Have they ever have a barista till you drop it? I know. No, they shouldn't do that now because people will wind up dying. They would die. People are crazy. We need to limit the amount of competition that people were actually allowed to involve. And that's true. So this is the coffee, the coffee competItions that we do and there are, it's a, there's a barista thing where they're making espresso. There's a brewer's thing where there brewing coffee, there's a tasters thing where they, they're, they're competing on how well they can taste coffee and discern the differences between coffee and stuff. So there is a coffee version of the Somalia?

Speaker 3:          01:38:38       Yeah, absolutely. So you drank this, you would know this is from Ethiopia if, if you didn't, if you didn't drink this, if you drank this and you called yourself a coffee pro and you weren't able to identify it as, as a chef, you, that would be a major. Um, you'd be a faker. Well, kind of. Yeah. I mean this is one of the classic origins of coffee that you need to be able to identify what could you get confused by? Like if you were really worried, like if you had a bet your mortgage on whether or not you could nail one, which would be, what would be a tricky one? The differences between what coffee's still in central America. They get really new because I mean think about that central american isthmus there, you know, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, there all right next to each other and as you said, like the same.

Speaker 3:          01:39:22       Very similar, right? So those coffees tastes very similar but like a coffee from another great coffee growing area is right in the middle of Kenya and Kenya is right just south of Ethiopia. But the coffee taste completely different, huh? Um, and uh, so there's a city called the okay. JusT as yoga chef is special in, in, in Ethiopia, a place called neery and y e r I n Kenya is really special and that it, it the coffee, their tastes like a black berries, you know, like this is like lemons there. It tastes like black berries or black currents. Really beautiful and savory like meat. now what would happen if you took that stuff though? like you took some plants from that area and then moved them to Hawaii? That's a great question. You usually get into the coffee business. You're asking the right questions in general.

Speaker 3:          01:40:17       We don't have very many examples of that. Um, because only recently have people started to move coffee around. But, but I tasted once a coffee from a farm in El Salvador that had the kenyan coffees from this, uh, this place in neary planted on it. And I, at the time I didn't know anything but I was tasting this coffee and I accused the guy that was working in my lab with me of making a mistake. It tastes like kenyan coffee, huh? So, uh, it's the varieties that have grown to these places that are in many ways determine these flavors. there's also a farm in, in, uh, in Panama that was kind of accidentally planted with some coffees from Ethiopia and the coffee tastes like ethiopian coffee.

Speaker 1:          01:41:05       Really? Yeah. So is there a similarity in the climate?

Speaker 3:          01:41:10       Yeah, if the climate is the same and they've. Coffee variety is the same because remember, all these thousands of varieties that exist in the world, you know, if in, in, in yoga chef, they grow three different varieties there. If you go to yoga chef and ask a farmer what varieties of coffee he's growing, he's got a choice of three m and they're different from anywhere else in the world. Those they look different. You can see that they're different,

Speaker 1:          01:41:33       right? Like those little tiny ones that we have. Exactly the, it's called [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       A mocha. Yeah. Mocha is the variety. So mlk, k a. This came from Yemen somehow and made it to Hawaii and they planned it.

Speaker 1:          01:41:47       That's rusty's hawaiian by the way. And it's really delicious and really tiny. They're like little, they're like seeds, almost like bbs. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's a good way to describe it. On pbs. Yeah. Um, so how often do you travel around the world helping people define the flavors of their coffees?

Speaker 3:          01:42:05       Well now I have a kid so I don't do it as much anymore, but there was a, there was a decade there where I would travel a one year, 200 days in a year. Well, it waS, I was, uh, I was just bugged out of your mind doing coffee. Yeah. Yeah. Tasting it more than a lot of times, by the way, when we're tasting coffee will spit it out so you don't get too fucked up. They just taste it and spit it. That's interesting. Do you feel bad about spitting it out? Sometimes? Sometimes you don't. If you don't, if stute delicious and you don't want to, you can just drink, drink it. Yeah. Wow. But, um, but yeah, but there's a lot of. I mean it's not just me. There's lots of, there's lots of people out there right now. In fact, I was chatting with a guy and in Kenya this morning, now what can be done

Speaker 1:          01:42:47       about the soil itself is their composting then improves the health of the plant.

Speaker 3:          01:42:53       Question that. Yeah, that one of the issues with coffee is you take all this coffee out from a farm and wherever, Kenya and you bring the coffee here, but you got to, you got to be bringing stuff back to the soil all the time. And otherwise the soil will be depleted. So getting nutrients back in the soil is really important. Composting is a big deal. It's good to have, um, access to manure if you can from cattle or chickens or whatever that they put it. It's a lot

Speaker 1:          01:43:23       preferred type of manure that you use. It depends on the soil because I know people are really in a chicken shit. Chicken shit is great because we have chickens and people asking us for our shit.

Speaker 3:          01:43:32       Yeah. Well it's like, it's like dynamite. That stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:43:36       It's weird. People ask me for shit. Um, so what about like rotten vegetables? Most any

Speaker 3:          01:43:44       good coffee farm will have a gigantic compost heap that they, that they have the coffee pulp and like that from when they process the coffee plus manure, chicken manure, all sorts of stuff

Speaker 1:          01:43:57       and this is all sort of leave and, and like piled up and then it's evenly distributed over the farm

Speaker 3:          01:44:03       and then they have to carry it. So farmers, we'll put it in a bag on their back and walk up these mountains and like put, you know, two or three kilograms of manure on each coffee plant. Now one coffee plant will produce about a pound of coffee in a year. So this gives you an idea how much work it is.

Speaker 1:          01:44:24       That's insane. It's crazy. one coffee plant produces a full bag of coffee in one year. In a year. Yeah. So why isn't coffee a million dollars? that's a great question. What would happen if coffee can be grown in the United States? It is probably would cost a million dollars.

Speaker 3:          01:44:38       What? YoU know, that's why you know, straight. This was probably pretty expensive. This straight hawaiian coffee.

Speaker 1:          01:44:45       Oh yeah. It was not cheap at all. It's very expensive. I think it's like, well, I forget, I shouldn't say

Speaker 3:          01:44:50       yeah, but anyway, it's a lot of money and that's why it's because it's because it's incredibly laboR intensive.

Speaker 1:          01:44:55       Yeah. That's amazing. Now I'm, the issue that they're having with a lot of farms is the depletion of the soil, correct. Minerally deficient soils had been, that's been an issue with farmers since the 19 twenties when they first started realizing.

Speaker 3:          01:45:10       Yeah. And, and then so, um, and this is a big challenge for all agriculture but, but coffee is no different how to maintain fertility in your soil without, because it takes a lot of work, like a lot of labor to get stuff back. And then, um, so chemical fertilizers, another option for, for farmers they use. But that's a problem too because It takes energy to make, you know, they burn gas basically to make npk fertilizer, which is chemical fertilizer. So organic farms don't use that kind of fertilizer. They make their own with compost, but it's so much effort. It's just a huge lead, expensive undertaking to do. so it's a challenge. It's one of the things that we face and we talk about a lot in coffee.

Speaker 1:          01:45:52       Is there a variation in the flavor of a plant that's been fertilized with the chemical feRtilizer or synthetic or whatever you call it as versed as opposed to compost?

Speaker 3:          01:46:01       No, as long as the. As long as the plant is healthy, it's possible to make it healthy in both those ways. So if the plant's healthy, it's gonna make good coffee,

Speaker 1:          01:46:10       but it seems like a huge difference in the chemical process itself. Right? Yeah. I mean you obviously have to burn things in order to.

Speaker 3:          01:46:18       It's like it's. Yeah. And, and, and, and then there are, there's a lot of middle ground too. I mean, I would say most, most good farmers or many good farmers use a little bit of, of synthetic fertilizer and a little bit of compost as well, and they kind of

Speaker 1:          01:46:33       multivitamins with a good diet.

Speaker 3:          01:46:35       That's exactly what it's like using chemical fertilizer is the same as using vitamin supplements.

Speaker 1:          01:46:40       You ever heard of a guy named dr joel wallach? No. He's a doctor who wrote a book called dead doctors don't lie and saw about minerally sufficient, insufficient soils and about a real epidemic we have with minerally deficient diets. Now. I don't know how much of what he said. It's fuckery. I need to really probably talk to someone. I'll talk to dr rhonda, patrick about it. Choose one of the guests that we have on the podcast. I'll say an actual scientist and yeah, she really understands what she's talking about, but this guy was talking about areas in the world where people live to be much longer or live to me much older and we're healthier and had darker hair longer and that it was because they were getting something called glacial milk, which is the runoff like water from glaciers. They actually had like a milky quality to it because it was so minerally rich right now as their areas like that where they grow coffee, which minerally rich coffee people

Speaker 3:          01:47:34       like the legend. There's a lot of legends and coffee. Well, yeah, I mean about special areas that make special coffee. You know, and you. You mentioned earlier volcanic soils, places that have volcanic soil that the farmers, if their coffee is great, they will attribute it to all of these things. But so far there's not a lot of like actual evidence to support any of that. Um, uh, all it is is we know and we're discovering these things all the time. You know, it's like what is the magic? I'm sort of mixture of the right variety, the right climate, the right kind of soil composition, the right kind of husbandry. It's this, it's so many factors together. It's, I don't think it makes sense to isolate one thing. Another thing that people always ask me is like if they're growing pine trees on the farm with their green coffee, can you tease the pine trees in the, in the, uh, in the coffee itself.

Speaker 3:          01:48:29       And I'm pretty sure that there's no, there's no way that, that, I mean, I've never experienced that, you know, but people, there's, these legends kind of come up are around cost and you do, you do taste amazing things in coffee that are inexplicably, like that coffee that we just drank. The definitely smells like lemons, right? Well, it smells like a tea. Yeah. Like lemon tea. Right. And it tastes good even when it cools. Oh yeah, taste better. I noticed that too. It's just, it's, I don't know why is, that's not the case with a lot of coffee. No, no, no, that's right. Why is that? What's. Well coffee is, we'll continue to extract over time. So whIle it's been sitting in this, in this thing, it's continuing to extract. It's going from, maybe it was maybe 18 percent when I pledged it in terms of percentage of extraction and it keeps on going up as it sits and so it'll evolve in terms of flavor.

Speaker 3:          01:49:21       The other thing that changes is you. So, uh, so there's this thing called habituation in tasting things. And uh, I wasn't completely hip to this until I taste scientist. Um, he, he did this demonstration for me and he did it with wine. He said he, he gave me a glass of this, this, a white wine from a New Zealand and he had me taste it and he said, you, you taste that green bell pepper note in this. You know, and that's the thing that they say about wines from this area and I said, yeah, I can taste it, and he says okay, and then he gave me a little bit of actual green bell pepper and he said, eat that, and I did. And then he said, Okay, now taste the wine again, and I tasted the wine again and it tastes Like a completely different wine.

Speaker 3:          01:50:08       And I said, what happened? He said, okay, so that, that wine had this chemical in it and he named the chemical. I don't remember what it was, but it was the green bell pepper chemical and then he's. And then when he gave me the green bell pepper, it overwhelmed my senses with that same smell. And so you know how if you're, if, if you use windex in your house, you smell it for a while and you're overwhelmed by it and then in a few minutes you can't smell it anymore. It's not that it's gone away, it's just that your brain has sort of screened it out.

Speaker 5:          01:50:36       Well, all factory senses dePend on change. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          01:50:40       And so once you get used to something, you can't smell it anymore. Yes. And so it. Same thinG happens with coffee. If you're drinking coffee and there's an overwhelming element than your, your olfactory, we'll screen it out and then you start tasting different things. So tHings change over time.

Speaker 5:          01:50:57       So smell certainly does enhance tastes or change tastes.

Speaker 3:          01:51:01       Yeah. In, in coffee especially, it's, it's at least half of thing.

Speaker 5:          01:51:06       It doesn't whine as well. Like I find that like, you know, a good wine like are like red wine. When I smell a good red wIne, like the smell of it actually makes it seem somewhat more delicious.

Speaker 3:          01:51:16       Yeah. Will flavor the definition of flavor is the, is the combination of aromatic and taste together. So if you eliminate it, if you have a cold or something and you eliminate your aromatics, suddenly food doesn't taste right. Nothing is right because you're only tasting sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory, which is what you can experience on your tongue. But your nose is able to get thousands of things. So there's this, there's this phenomenon that happens when you're tasting things. Um, and uh, it's, it, it's called retro nasal, so when you swallow this is weird, but you swallow something and then it coats your throat and that the aromatics kind of go backwards up through your nose from your throat. Whoa. And um, and it's, that's called retro nasal from the back of your notes and so you're actually smelling things at the same time that you're swallowing them.

Speaker 5:          01:52:11       That is fascinating. Is there any restaurant in the los angeles area that gets the whole thing right? Like great food, great wine and great coffee. That's a great question. Why doesn't someone nailed that? Somebody should. Somebody should have like coffee, like this. Yeah, like the Perfect cup of coffee roasted March 4th, you know, so roasted a week ago. What's today's date? What's the offIcial day right now? It's the 17th. What is it? 10th, 10th the 10th. So six, six, six, 17. I don't know what day it is. Yeah. How about that? Seven days off. Yeah, I knew it was one of those mondays. Um, so six days ago. It's really recently roasted. That Would be an amazing thing for someone to pull off in a restaurant, have like really delicious wines to go with really delicious food and have the same effort put into the coffee's. A few restaurants are starting to really work on it and drill it right. Yeah. And what do they know that I know of in la, but none. But how dare you? La? Yeah. I'm sure there might be. I just haven't been there yet. San francisco must,

Speaker 3:          01:53:12       uh, san francisco has a couple. There was one in baltimore of all places really? That did an amazing job. Is it still open woodberry kitchen yet? It's still a great coffee service. Amazing coffee, sir.

Speaker 5:          01:53:23       Amazing conference service and amazing food is amazing. I mean, the guy, this guy named spike does this. I mean, he is amazing. This dude. Well, I'm going to get that number from you because I'm going there in a couple of weeks in baltimore. Oh, you have to eat it with kitchen. It's great. I'm gone. Yeah. Done. Yeah. How about that? Yeah. Wow. Um, awesome. Um, what, what else can we talk about when it comes to coffee? Is there anything that we missed?

Speaker 3:          01:53:45       No, I mean, uh, no. I don't knoW. I mean the, the, uh, the, some of the things that, that, uh, people always want to know is about decaf.

Speaker 5:          01:53:56       Yes. That was another thing. I, yeah. I'm glad you brought that up.

Speaker 3:          01:53:59       Yeah. Well, I mean it's the thing you see when you work in coffee, you go to cocktail parties or something. People always ask you these questions. They ask you what's your favorite coffee and why? Because they want to know. They also want to know what the deal with decaf is, is what is the deal? Well, I mean, so coffee has this alkaloid a caffeine and um, and then you have to get it out. So the first way that they got it out as they use it, a solvent like, uh, like paint thinner. Yeah. Kind of more like dry cleaning solvent. This is god. This is a, a 100 Years ago. And they noticed that it was able to take the caffeine out and that was the original. But nobody who wants to use that in there. So over the years they've developed better ways of doing it using carbon dioxide or charcoal filters to get the, to get the caffeine out.

Speaker 5:          01:54:50       And how much do you actually get out? Because I had heard that starbucks has a particularly high caffeine content of their regular coffee and that there might be a little bit left to that when you have decaf sound right to me. No, no,

Speaker 3:          01:55:04       I, I don't see any reason why starbucks would have a higher caffeine content

Speaker 5:          01:55:08       of their coffee. So it's just an urban legend. Sounds like engine to me. Yeah. Um, what about the decaf, does it have any caffeine in it at all or is it trace amounts? Trace trace

Speaker 3:          01:55:18       and, and uh, uh, so, you know, people that are like allergic sensitive to it shouldn't drink decaffeinated coffee, but, but people that are uh, uh, but you know, most and each of these methods is slightly different, but trace amounts of caffeine and decaffeinated coffee, that's good. The good methods, the swiss water process, for example, you may have heard of, um, is, uh, is one, there's a number of these methods that are really good at getting, getting the caffeine out and not destroying the flavor of the coffee.

Speaker 1:          01:55:51       So what is the law says? Starbucks tall decaf. A tall, which is a small. Has nine point five milligrams of caffeine in it. Okay. What is a normal cup of coffee habit?

Speaker 3:          01:56:02       Like a hundred 50, 200 years.

Speaker 1:          01:56:05       So that's the tray. So it's a little bit, a little bit, but it's not caffeine free. It's just low caffeine. Yeah. but that's pretty low. I mean, you know. Sure. But unless you're super sensitive to it. But if you have a 20 ounce decaf you're getting. What about 18? Maybe sort of double. What does that. A 16 ounce. Sixteen ounces double, right? Because that's an eight is a tall and eight. Now, I don't know. This is the starbucks bar language that don't write well. They're get all goofy with grande's. Call him. I know venti is 20 ounces. I know. Yeah. That's silly. Called medium. Just don't call it tall either. That shit ain't tall. And what world? Gulliver travels. What world is that tall? It's ridiculous. Yeah. So if someone is a really sensitive to caffeine though, they can also still probably get a little bit of a caffeine kick. Yeah, that's true. if there's a decaf, they're super sensitive to it. So it's not caffeine free.

Speaker 3:          01:56:56       It's not. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:56:58       I guess called decaf but it's not decaffeinated. It's only. Mostly. It's mostly decaf. Decaffeinated. Yeah. Um, but the flavor,

Speaker 3:          01:57:06       right? Well, so now the flavors. Okay, great. I've, I've done this, I've tasted great decaffeinate a great coffee that becomes decaffeinated and it's certainly the flavor is impacted by caffeine, by the removal of caffeine, by the process that goes through,

Speaker 1:          01:57:23       but it's still delicious coffee. Okay. Like give us an example of a delicious decaffeinated coffee that we should.

Speaker 3:          01:57:30       Well, any of these, any qa, any coffee company that's like putting extraordinary care into their regular coffee, it's very likely that they will be putting extraordinary care into their decaf to. And it Just, you should ask them about it, you know, I mean, uh, uh, you know, if you engage with them and they weRe proud of their decaf and his chances are that they are putting a lot of care into it. And I know that, okay, I used to run a coffee company, coffee program for a coffee company back east called counterculture coffee and I put extra effort into my decaffeinated coffee because I knew that the people that were drinking that we're drinking it only for the flavor. They weren't drinking it for the drug effect. They, they just, they cared enough about coffee that they wanted to drink it just because of the way that it tasted. And I felt like that was a responsibility, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:58:21       that's a very interesting point because you're not dealing with any people just looking for a drug.

Speaker 3:          01:58:25       Right. Right. And, and so and so, uh, but the, I mean, the problem, the problem with decaf I think is that consumers who drink decaffeinated coffee, they don't necessarily expect to pay more. They feel lIke it should be the same, you know, and I get that, but it does cost money to put it through the process of decaf

Speaker 5:          01:58:47       and eating well, don't they feel like that most coffees overpriced in the first place? I don't think people really truly realize the amount of effort when you broke it down by one pound is one tree for a fucking year. It's totally true. What is the, is that an eight ounce bag of coffee? What does that. How many? What was that? This is bringing that real hawaiian roasters. Was that sales is probably 16 ounces. Fourteen ounces, 14 ounces. So it's essentially a year of one plant. Yeah, that's an unbelievable man. Yeah. No, it's crazy. And you can get definitely 20 bucks or whatever the hell it is. So we have this idea

Speaker 3:          01:59:17       deal of the in the depression and nickel cup of coffee and, and uh, you know, that's what my grandparents had access to a nickel cup of coffee or a cup of coffee. They think it's stupid. Meanwhile, grow your own coffee dummy. Good luck. But I mean that was intentional. I mean, restaurants at that time, that was, they were losing money on their five cent, cup of coffee's even in the twenties really because, but they did that. It was sort of a lost leader. They were trying to get people into the restaurants, you know, so, um, but it kind of stuck in people's mind that coffee should be cheap and, and, and it shouldn't be. It's, it, it in my view, coffee should be the best you can possibly make it taste. And then if that costs money, whatever, just drink.

Speaker 5:          02:00:02       Bless. So let me ask you this. Save your traveling across America and you stop at a diner because you're hungry. And do you even fuck around even order a cup of coffee? Sometimes I do. Sometimes I get sad when they bring you out. That little stupid white cop. It is tasted. I mean, I love diners. you know, I love to eat at diners. I freaking love, but you don't love that. Drink coffee there.

Speaker 3:          02:00:24       And I love pancakes and hash browns and all that stuff. And uh, I wish that the few times I've gone to places where the coffee was out

Speaker 5:          02:00:35       regionally. Good. And did they tell you it was really good? Cool. Yeah. Sometimes sometimes they're, they're proud of their, their deal and they all make it good. So it's someone who takes as much effort into their omelets, right as they do into their craft. Well, it should be, yeah, it should be expected if it's financially feasible, but that's. And That's what it comes down to. People got to be willing to pay for good stuff. Like what does the bag like this delicious bag of ethiopian. You're A good show. Good show. Usually there'll be, I don't know, maybe 12 or $13. Dude, I'm going to sleep with this shit next to my pillow. It's good. I just want this. I hope you drink it, drink the shit out of this sometimes. And this always happened to me when I, you know, I'd get a special coffee, I give it to my parents and they'd throw it in the freezer and save it for a special occasion because they're like, well, none of this special coffee, you know.

Speaker 5:          02:01:24       No, no, no, we're drinking this all day. I'm going to put that out in the kitchen too. I'm not going to put in the freezer. I don't have to register. I drink, drink, drink it quickly. All right, so we're going to leave this out and we're going to report on this and thank you for coming by and thank you to wrecking ball coffee for making this awesome ethiopian years. It was a pleasure talking to you. Um, is there anything else we can cover? Anything that people a don't know about coffee that should know anything else while we're gearing up somebody that was looking at the twitter feed and somebody mentioned something. Oh, okay. I've got a few things that you're, that people might be interested. You ready to catch it? Coffee. Oh, I've had that kopi luwak. Yeah. Yeah, but that's made by a civet they eat, right?

Speaker 5:          02:02:07       Yeah, I've had it. I've ordered it. Interesting. Folks who don't know really is shit out by this cat thing. Right. It's like it's in the cat family that. Well, yeah, I think it's more like a raccoon. Yeah. And then eats the beans and then ships them out and then they take it out of its poop and when it goes through its digestive tract, it imparts a very mellow taste to the coffee. So it got in this movie, you know the bucket list, everybody. What movies? The bucket. There's a movie called the bucket list. Jack nicholson. And you don't remember this, but. No, I never heard of it. It's about some old guys and they had a bucket list of things to have things to do before they died. And one of the things was they drink the coffee and so that of course it started a rash of people asking people like me about this, this, this.

Speaker 5:          02:02:52       Here's the animal. Look at that cute little thing. Well, that's fake, man. He's not really talking. Oh, that's the beans that he pooped out. I first tried that with my friend tate, who's one of the owners of caveman coffee. Tate's always been a, a, a crazy coffee kind of sore. But we were in miami and we saw this caveman coffee by the way. Uh, he's out of New Mexico. Okay, cool. I'm in this place in miami was some sort of a specialty coffee joint. There was a restaurant that had these really expensive coffees and I forget what it was like 30 bucks a glass a cup or somethIng really expensive. Something really nutty because it came out of this cats. But yeah, and the problem is that it's really rare and that's why it's expensive. It's good though. I've had it. It's delicious. I'm glad. Yeah, I'm glad you.

Speaker 5:          02:03:38       Okay. There can be a. There can be some pretty rotten of this. wait a minute. It comes out of cats assets rotten. how weird it is. There are these places where they have the cats in cages in it a fuck. You know what I mean? And we think of that. You got me now. God damn it. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to. Yeah, you're black fish. My kopi luwak was black fleece. Black fish is that new documentary that's killing seaworld, right? Because people got a chance to see what it's really. Right. Fucking seaworld Is terrible. It's terrible there. Their slave colonies, they're enslaving intelligent beings that we can understand. It's true. It is. It is 100 percent and, and uh, yeah, so I, I got a touch of that same sadness when I saw that, when I saw that and I've been to the places where they do this, imagining it just stands to reason. if you have a product like this that's very expensive, then you're going to have these fucking animals. do you get a lot of fraud because it's so expensive, you know, I would imagine so. And, and, but, you know, I mean the amount of pleasure that you can get from a coffee,

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       like the one I brought you or some of these other ones that you've mentioned. Um, you know, it's not solely necessarily to go to that extent. The other thing I noticed on the twitter feed, somebody mentioned coffee going extinct. There was a news, uh, about a year ago, there was a news thIng that was talking about coffee going extinct. Um, and, and uh, and it's because, so that this is tied into this, uh, this Ethiopia thing. Um, the fact that, you know, 98, 99 percent of the total genetic diversity of coffee is in Ethiopia. And not only in in the country, but in one. There you go, you're, you're fast on the um, it's not even Ethiopia, all, it's the south west part of Ethiopia where coffee is indigenous to

Speaker 1:          02:05:29       pull an image of the beans itself like that, like that. Like you gotta get a blow up on one of those because most people don't even know what coffee beans look like. So those are, we call them coffee cherries for obvious reasons. Yeah, I mean they look like a fruit. It's so interesting because we think of coffee as, you know, if you, if you're crazy, you grind your own stuff, right? That's how most people think. But it's already cooked and roasted and yeah, we think of it as food

Speaker 3:          02:05:52       in coffee, you know, and you know, uh, one of the biggest things that we can do for people that is, yeah, it's beautiful grapes. Get people to understand that coffee is the seed of a fruit.

Speaker 1:          02:06:04       I need to get some of that coffee. Fruit I want to eat, but you'd have to send me the dry stuff. Where can I go and actually buy the fruit and eat it? Is there a place compete in san diego, santa barbara, California. So that's right. That's right. That's right. Five minutes away from here or something. Yeah. I fucking love santa barbara. I've actually thought about moving there. Oh, I'm there. So what am I there? I think I'm there in april or something should go visit. jay's a great guy. You go. The fruit is delicious. You eat fruit, right? I love fruit. Yeah. Then this is the. This is the guy I'm there in santa barbara. May second. Friday, May 2nd. I'm at the lobero theater with joey diaz. Yeah. go check. So I will do. I will definitely go and check that out because I want to go just to support that guy.

Speaker 1:          02:06:47       I love when someone does something that cool, you know, it takes a crazy project like that and then seven years. He's a cool guy for sure. Well listen man, this is really fascinating stuff. I'm really interested in, uh, I really, uh, appreciate you coming on here and educating us and giving us all the uh, the low down on coffee. I've been, um, been on a journey to kind of understand and learn the process of this over the last few months, just really kind of digging deep into the coffee flavor a barrel. It's, it's really been fascinating stuff and very intriguing and stimulating in a, in a lot of ways. just the ideas behind it. Like it's cool to uncover this whole sort of community of people trying to enhance flavors and tight taste them and

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       change. I mean, I had no idea there was a specialty coffee association of America until just a few days ago. Yeah, well, I mean serious business and you want to see a.org.

Speaker 3:          02:07:44       You want to hear a crazy thing you're talking about like intellectual connection and stuff like that. Um, so coffee was invented in Ethiopia as we said in, in Ethiopia. They do it like a coffee ceremony, like a, you know, it's a very ceremonial way to prepare it and drink it. And when they do the coffee ceremony, they, It's like they gather people together from the village, they and they talk about things. They talk about the news of the village, they talk about things that are going on in the world. When coffee moved from Ethiopia to Yemen, totally different deal. Like in Ethiopia, it's always a woman that makes coffee, whereas in Yemen it wasn't like that, but they still would talk about news and intellectual and stuff like that. Then coffee moved from Yemen to europe, um, you know, Italy and england and places like that and the coffee house still remained a place for intellectual exchange and discourse and stuff like that. They planned the american revolution in coffee houses, you know, in

Speaker 5:          02:08:47       we're wired, right? They're like, fuck, there's something about, there's something about coffee that like that, like gets your mind going as well as stimulates you and wakes you up. But also the tea party movement like that, that had an effect on the way the United States took off just by simply the fact that they went from tea to coffee. That's what the, the, there is. There are people who speculate that that's totally valid. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:09:09       That, that, that coffee consumption is a part of the american, uh, drive to ingenuity and imagination.

Speaker 5:          02:09:17       Ron's fucking speed. We're country on speed. I wonder if they could show gross domestic product posts. Starbucks. Not starbucks impacted people's productivity, but still right. If you go to

Speaker 3:          02:09:29       somebody at a coffee shop, you're going to talk about something that's different than going to drink with somebody at a bar or have dinner with somebody or something like that. It's different. It's somehow more about exchanging info

Speaker 5:          02:09:40       nation, more imagination. It's stimulating. The stimulant of caffeine in coffee is stimulating and then the flavor is enriching. You enjoy the flavor and then you get fucking happy and it's been that way since the origin of coffee. Coffee houses. Yeah. Coffeehouses were always thought of as places where people read poetry and you know. Yeah. And he politics, etc. And as you said, plan revolutions. That's interesting to me. Yeah, it is interesting and that's one of the reasons

Speaker 3:          02:10:08       that I think that I like to work in coffee because I'm into that sort of thing. Anyway. Intellectual engagement, creativity, you know, music, poetry, politics, these, this, this is always been like that. It's like this. And in asia, in arabia, everywhere the coffee goes to second.

Speaker 5:          02:10:27       Do you feel like coffee doesn't get enough credit for the impact that it has had culturally? Yeah, I think

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       I, I do think sometimes it bums me out this idea of like cheap people want cheap, abundant coffee, but it's just, it's only function is as a drug to get them to work in the morning, you know, and it's been cheapened by our culture. Um, but, but It's it special and, and it could go away, you know, really well. Yeah. So that, this whole extinction thing is about, about how we're 98 percent of this, this, the origin of coffee is because of climate change. The scientist who does this work is done the projections and if and if the weather there as predicted increases by a few degrees, then the coffee won't be able to survive and it could be 80 percent wiped out in these natural coffee forests in 50 years.

Speaker 1:          02:11:26       Whoa.

Speaker 3:          02:11:27       And then then we'll be up a creek because the motherload of genetic origin of coffee will be gone essentially.

Speaker 1:          02:11:37       That's intense. And then can there be steps done too,

Speaker 3:          02:11:40       guard that we're trying to do that in the industry. So we had actually at a conference about a year ago on this very question where we talked about preservation of the genetic diversity of coffee, which means taking coffee out of Ethiopia, planting it elsewhere to make sure that we've got other examples of the same, of the genetic diversity, diversity in other parts of the world. um, you know, preserving it. There's other ways to preserve a coffee, you know, by freezing the seeds, you know, and putting them in storage. So if we need them, we can go back to them.
