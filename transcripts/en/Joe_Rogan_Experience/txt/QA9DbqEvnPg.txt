Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Three, two, one, boom, and we're alive. What's happening? I, I'm just stoked to be here because I'm stoked to have you here. Man. It's a pleasure to meet you. I love your show. Thank you. It's fun. It's a fun fucking car show. It really is, man. It is. I tell people I might be the smartest guy in the world. I figured out how to drink beer and play with cars. Paid for. Yeah, but it's like, it's a fun show. It's like you're not taking yourself too seriously. You having a good time, you know you're buying and selling awesome cars. Oh yeah. For sure. It's was a dream of mine to get it done. It took eight years to get it sold, but here we are now. Did it really? Yeah, it started to. I started pitching the show in 2004. We didn't start till 2008 or 2012.

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       What were you doing before that? Uh, before television or before gas monkey? Yeah. I kind of had two stages in life. I was a firefighter police officer medic before I was old enough to drink. I mean, I'm talking 19 years old carrying a gun, probably want the smartest thing for them to let me do. And then I'm to let you know when you were 19 I had a badge. I was a cop. I mean literally I was a police officer and uh, so by the time I was $20, it's also a firefighter and a. So I did that for awhile and then moved into printing and advertising and then sold that and got into this. So was it just like something you just always into cars and that's what led you to the show, you know, how would I tell the story diplomatically? Um, realistically I was watching the shows that were on TV at the time.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       I'm always been a car nut and a motorcycle guy and what have you. And I realized one night that my kids are never in the room watching it and my wife's not in the room watching it, you know, and uh, the shows that we're on, we're a little bit too much bravado and, and I'm a tough guy and you know, so I dug it and all my buddies dug it, but the wives and stuff and I was like, golly, they're missing a big chunk of the market here. If you could tone down that part of it a little bit and still have a cool brand and still be a cool guy, you know, and get the moms and the kids in the room, hopefully it's a lot more successful. And so that's kind of where the idea came from and I just went out and started it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       That's interesting. So the marketing side, have you kicked in? So the marketing side of you went, ah, I think there's another way to do this. I mean, I'm still a tattooed guy with some jewelry, but you know, I got a pit bull or poodle on a leash, not a pit bull on a chain. The show, it doesn't seem compromised. That's what's interesting about it because it seems like a kind of a guy show. I never thought about it that way. Well, the way I approached it was just like when I was a kid and my dad had a garage, a not a not open for public garage. What do you have plays that we kept his car and the neighbors would come over and they tinker and they drink beer and that's what our guys do. So we kind of took that approach of that's what gas monkey does. We just drink some beer and play some cars and goof around. It's just like Saturday afternoon, but all week long. Did you have any background in, in automobile

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       knowledge? Did you know, like how to fix things or did you. Yeah, I've never really been the full fabricator. Uh, you know, I understand everything and networks works, but I'm probably more of a business guy. So I was able to go out and hire good guys to do the fabricating stuff and we've got a great team. But I did have the car knowledge and I and I had had the eyeball for what was good and keeping up with what was going to be happening and things like that. And that's kind of my strong suit is saying okay,

Speaker 2:          00:03:28       Porsche's are fixed to be popular so we're going to get into 3:56 is or broncos like the he drove it is you know, or what have you. And I keep my eye on the market. That's interesting. But you still do keep your eye on the market. I saw that 68 that you have outside of the 68 Chevelle. Sixty eight, 68 convertible. God Damn, that's a nice car. It's a good. It's probably the best one I've ever seen. I mean from an original standpoint. Yeah. It's meant. I mean it's got a little scuffs out. It's, it's driven, you know, but it's, it's in perfect condition. It doesn't have any dents or anything wrong with it is literally a little old lady from Pasadena. I mean the lady bought it brand new and she passed away a couple of years ago and I bought it from her grandson. Wow, what a cliche.

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       Fifty 2000 original miles and never been read old lady from Pasadena is a cliche. It was technically Pomona, but you know, same shit. Wow. Yeah. That car, those uh, I mean I've said this on the show a million times. I'm a giant fan of like the time period of 1965 to somewhere around like 71. They fell apart. Yeah. Know like you still get a 71 challenger [inaudible] 71. Barracuda is still pretty sweet for sure. But then you get into like 72, 73. They had to start putting. The big bumpers are there with everything just fell apart and he got the gas crunch and then everything got four cylinders and it was, it was a bad time in the late seventies for sure. It was a bad time, but it's a good time now. It's a really interesting, really interesting time now for muscle cars. It's the racist, so crazy that they're putting out street legal cars you could buy from a dealer with 700 plus horsepower and almost every dealer has one now. Oh yeah, for sure. I mean, I've got a demon myself. Eight horsepower. It's fucking crazy. Now. The new GT, $500 out, that's going to have over 700 horsepower. You know you have the Camaro l a m, what is it? One Ellie know. What

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       was it? [inaudible] one. Ellie know what? What the fuck is the name of the one? Zero. Zero. One one ellie, which is 650 horsepower and then the new M, Z are one at 750 horsepower. This is preposterous. Oh, it's, it's A. I think it could be a little dangerous. You know what everybody out there thinking, Hey, I can drive a 700 horsepower car because it's completely different than a normal one. Well, did you see the video of the guy from one of the head guys at gm who took it on track? Like one of the first days of the release in the car and he spun out on the first

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       turn and slammed into the wall. I can't say much. I wrecked a brand new hell cat the other day. Race in Woodward. Did you really? Oh No. I went to Woodward Dream cruise and they had a little celebrity match up and I was racing and just lost it and hit the wall. Took the whole side of the car. Were you on a track or where you want to strip? It was a street track, uh, that they had right there on Woodward Avenue. So they put up the blocks and you take off those, uh, those hell cats are beautiful, but they're not, they're not that great at corner. And that's still a giant car. Big Car. Yeah. Mustang and the Camaro going to do better in the corners for sure. Yeah, the hell kind of so much front. There's so much out in front. I mean, it really does remind you more than any of those other cars though, of those 1970 cars, you know, really has that, that shape is more I can like, if you look at it, 1969 Camaro and then you look at a 2019 Camaro you like, ah, I don't see it.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       That's not the same thing. But the challenger really does look like that old car. Well, Kim and Tim can discuss, killed it. I mean that was his whole passion project the whole time he was running dodge and he just absolutely nailed it. Yeah, no they did. They made a great looking modern muscle car. The other ones are just great looking cars. I mean they, they are still muscle cars, but they don't really think. You don't really think about the old days when you see him now. They've tried but they didn't get it as good as dodge. Now you guys make some fucking great built to, you know, you guys have done some really sweet custom builds like you were telling me outside that the longest you do a build for us 25 days a week. Got It down to about 25 from 32 ish when we started.

Speaker 1:          00:07:36       Uh, so when you see a car on the show, um, if it's a single episode that we built that car in 25, 26 days, that's crazy. Start to finish paint interior everything. How do you do it so quick? A lot of planning and we've learned over seven years now and 130 of them that um, you know, we've just got a process in and the crew that I have at the shop now is unbelievably phenomenal and there's only six guys doing it. There's six guys that do it, 25 days we're done. That's insane. But what about like if you're going to do custom suspension or you know, art more Morrison Chassy or something like that. It just takes some planning. So literally what we do is we build the car three times. This is what I tell everybody will say, okay, we're going to build this 68 Chevelle and so we decide how we're going to build it and what kind of parts we're going to use, what kind of suspension wheels, motor.

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       We, we put all that down on paper and then if it works mathematically for the project we want to do, then I go find the car. Then when I find the car, we order every single part and we don't start that car until every single thing that was on that list is in house has been checked and we're ready to go. So now we've got his actual fabrication time and human error and we're ready to go. Still. Seems like such a short amount of time and all the bills that I've seen take seven months, nine months, a year. It's just the shops are set up differently. It may be one or two guys or maybe they've got kind of, you know, assembly programs going on or what have you, but we get in there like you'll love the way we're building right now. We're building a 77 international scout and started with a really nice one. Orange, white stripes, plaid interior. I mean the whole ball of wax whack the, the chassis out from under it put in a full Chris Austin chassis works chassis with only two wheel drive and it's all 2018 hellcat. Eight speed automatic Jesus in it and slammed on the ground, but it's still removable top. And what? It was a great California truck, I guarantee you that. Oh Wow. So you made it. So you lowered it? Yeah. We're calling it the health gap.

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       Uh, wow. That's pretty bad ass it. It's going to be wicked Gar. Yeah. Those a hellcat. Chassies um, uh, Jonathan Ward, the same guy who's doing this is who, who did my bronco. The icon there. Doing that with a one of the. I think it's a super bird. One of the, one of those iconic mopars Yep. From the late sixties, early seventies. They're doing a full hellcat chassis and the whole deal with that. Oh really? Yeah. Um, what, what company was the first one to really get stupid with these cars? I guess it was Kinda corvette with the Zr one with horsepower figures. Yeah, for sure. Corvette guy stepped out there with the CR one and started cranking it up. Uh, everybody was kind of in production. You had, you had the resurgence of shelby? Yeah, there it is. There's Jonathan Wards or outlook or that thing that's good looking.

Speaker 2:          00:10:29       That is like literally like trying to have a block, like a city block on wheels. They take around a corner. Look how long that got him thinking is. Yeah, that's going to be a fresh card for sure. Bad Ass. He does some awesome shit over there too. He's a. he's doing well. He's doing one. I don't think you can talk about. I think he's. He's keeping it under wraps, but he's got a bunch of cool shit. Yeah, for sure. He's never been there. I have not been straight down the street. I know. Go visit afterwards with my. I don't think I'm going to make my flight. When's your flight? I don't know. I've got a couple of Martin hold notice. I said say I got a couple on hold because I don't think I make enough money for a plane yet. Going to talk to disco and that was like a private plane, is that what you're saying? Yeah, I don't. I mean we're all scrambling for something. Yeah, that's the ultimate scramble. The private jet money, but that, that is just so much fucking money. That seems ridiculous. Yeah, but I'd like to have a tricked out one gas monkey on it. Big Old monkey on the tail gas with a keg in it somewhere. Oh yeah, for sure. Now when you do these shows and you bargain people down and then they watched the show to people ever get pest. I've had a few.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       And uh, in the first, uh, first few years they were just excited, you know, that we were going to be doing something with the car and it was always an element of a, of a sentiment to it, you know, it was their dads or their moms or grandmas or whatever and they want to see it go to a good home. So you got several different kinds of people. They want you to not do anything or if you're going to fix it up, we want to see it, you know, all kinds of things like that. But nowadays it's a little more harder for me to get a decent deal because, because we will know the success of the show and I show up and they're like, oh, you're that guy on TV. Not, I didn't say $10,000. I said 13. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Well I would imagine when people see what you sell them for after you fix them up, then they get a little upset.

Speaker 1:          00:12:24       Yeah, they can. But I mean they don't understand the amount of work and time and money that we've put into it. Most of the cars that we're building on the show now, we're putting elite 100 grand in and sometimes as much as $300. Really, you know, I mean we're building everything we're building now. When the new season comes out in June, people are going to be amazed because we're building this kind of stuff. Wow. It's wicked cool when you're doing that in 25 days. Yeah. Fuck man. Just put together a good plan and execute it. Well, it must be like a thing now because the show that people want to get a gas monkey bill car. They do. But um, how would I say this diplomatically? If it weren't for employees, vendors and customers, business would be great. So we, we, uh, we don't do a lot for the, the customer, uh, until we built it for ourselves and then we sell it to them, but as far as coming in off the street, we just liked building what we want to build, honing our skills.

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       And then we find a buyer every once in awhile I'll have god come in and go, look, I can, this is what I want, but I can, I won't call you. I won't come in there with a new steering wheel, you know, it's like, it gets. That's why a lot of times cars do take seven months or a year or cause the guy that's happened, it's built is in there every other weekend going up. I don't know, maybe we move this over here and paint it purple. Oh yeah, I get it. Yeah. No, it does seem like it would be way better to just build it. How you like it and then sell it. Well, yeah, I mean it's still a business decision. I'm trying to build it to where I think it's gonna do the most, you know, the most money at the end of the day and stay true with what's going on as far as that particular car and what's going on in the marketplace and technology and what have you.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       Um, and we do get a lot of calls where people come in and go, okay, I want that exact same thing and so we'll build another one. Well sometimes you do buy cars and then just sell them without doing anything to it, right? Yeah. That's what we call our bs stories. Will buy something and bring it in. Maybe just put some wheels on it or whatever. But usually it's just clean it up, get it running, sell somebody else's dream because not everybody can afford a fully built car and slash or they want to do it themselves. So we get them a good project. I don't think people realize how much money is involved in a fully built car. Like if you ever seen those revegy mustangs. I was looking at those last night. It was pretty intensive build. Really, really interesting stuff. Has got to take. It's, it's essentially not really a mustang.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       I mean it's kind of licensed by Ford. It looks exactly like a Mustang and also a mustang parts, but he's got everything new is just brand new, like a brand new suv. You take the kids to soccer except really fast and fun to drive. And 19, 66, 65, 66. He's got a GT 3:50. That's a, it's not really a 66, GT, 3:50 every part of it. All the fenders, everything's all newly fabricated steel. We're going to do that this season to where I'm going to build a car back to the original, like a 60. I was sad. I'm going to do Mustang or if we're going to do a Camaro, but there's this guy's cars. I mean, come the fuck on. That is beautiful. Well, we're going to build one that never existed. Look how pretty that God damn thing is. He's killing it. I'd want to see what one of those things is like in real life.

Speaker 2:          00:15:39       He's even got pushed. Buttons start, you know, um, it senses when you're near the, uh, the car. So it will unlock for you, but it's the just, it seems like super high quality built to mean look how fucking pretty that is. The trick is, is how much work goes into it because yes they do make these parts aftermarket and what have you, but a lot of times that's not the best stuff in the world. So you ended up fabricating that and massage and it in and making all the gaps right. And so you can't just expect that you're going to buy a set, a new, a new front end it vendors and hood and everything going to work out perfect. You're going to always have to massage it and get it right. Well I've been paying attention to this guy for awhile and essentially what he's been doing is honing the process over the last few years and he's got a company now that makes a thing, it's called dynacore that makes all the parts.

Speaker 2:          00:16:32       They make everything in terms of like the body's body stamps. Yeah. And you know, he's got his whole process down, but you know, when you watch them drive the cars, it seems like he's. I mean it, it sounds perfect, like everything inside of it seems like completely locked down. No squeaks and rattles is really like a modern car for sure. And there's a lot of shops that do an amazing job at doing that stuff. That's what I like, what I don't like. I mean I liked the way they look. If I look at like an old, like a 67, gt 500. I liked the way they look, but if you try to hit the brakes on one of those things or if you try to make a turn with those old tires, everything's fucking that skinny and you know, the balance is all wonky. Nineteen 67 car balance. We get a lot of that. I've built a few cars for, for a contest and somebody when they're like, oh, I want this car, and then they're like, it's, this is horrible. I'm like, that's because it's a stock 65 bus thing and what have you. Because if you don't realize what you're buying and then yeah, it can be a disappointing process. Yeah. Those old cars man mean we've come a long way. It's, it's pretty amazing if you go back from 1970 car to a 2019 car and you drive and you hit the brakes

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       and he do all the numbers like stopping 60 to zero and handling. I mean the cars of today are pretty ridiculous. It is absolutely amazing. The technology that's out and the fact that we can use that technology so much easier. I mean you can build these kinds of cars or anything you dream up because you can literally do it right here with your google and your pocket. Yeah. Okay. I want to do this and this and what have you. So it ends up being the cars that we're putting out are definitely just like a brand new car yet, but it's a really interesting time to, for Resto mods because so many people are into that now. They realized that they liked the looks of those old cars, but they're not really into the way they drove. Correct. Everybody's about comfort and Bluetooth and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:18:35       So I'm not really that way. I'm a 32 ford nut and I kinda like cars the way that they more or less came out. I mean I'm all for maybe some disc brakes or safety or whatever, but I like the squeak it and having to learn how to drive it and figure it out. And the character of transmissions. Exactly. Yeah. How much longer before the manuals dead? I think it's already got the nails in the coffin. Seems like it. But then, you know, like American cars, they'll come out with cars like the GT 3:50. You can't even get it with an automatic fuck off. Yeah. They won't even sell it to you. Yeah. And they're going to hold on with that as long as they can. But you know, your big competition cars, porsche, Ferrari, Lambo, Mercedes, that you know, it's, you can't get them in a manual.

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       Wow. Everybody wants that nurburgring time. You know, want that super fast nurburbring time. And unless you have a double clutch transmission, unless you have paddle shifts, you're going to miss a second here and second there and then people are gonna. Look at it when it's so ridiculous. The people that look at those times, Jack is the average joe it and going out there and doing that. I mean the modern cars mean like the Zl one that we were talking about earlier. I think they're down to the one lie I think is down to a seven minute and real low seconds Nurburg green time, which is fucking crazy. That's faster than a gt three Rs from a couple of years ago for sure. For $60,000 car that you could buy the Chevy dealership, eh? Probably close to 80, but yeah. Yeah, I think it's like 78.

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       Okay. Yeah. But they're loaded. But nominal car, it's, it's, uh, I agree that that corvette and probably the demon or, or two cars that are the most bang for the buck. I mean just get in and go to zero. One in or the Zr one rather is almost too stupid. It's almost too ridiculous. It seems like if you're a regular person and you, you buy that and you try to take it somewhere for you to understand the limits of the grip, how much gas you can apply for you to have an educated foot. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I, I, those where they first started making those. How was it seven or eight years ago? Maybe a little longer. I had a client have me get one. He brought it back the next day scared to death because I just sell it because I'll never drive it. He does that. That is just stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       Yeah. I saw a picture of one the other day in my Google newsfeed that someone had bought and wreck the next day. Smashed it. I was just reading today. Uh, uh, somebody sent me a link. Uh, did you see the episode where we built the [inaudible] look at that fucking. It's fucking wicked. I'm doing something with that right now that, uh, I guess I can imagine everything you see there, the styling, the, the, the carbon fiber points, the lift in the front and everything that we all have it, but we're doing it with a 72 river boat tail. What? Yeah, it's going to be frickin sick. We've already chopped the top and brought it down so that it doesn't have that clam mouth and looking windshield. And so we're taking all of the bunch of our styling cues in our and definitely all of our driving components ideology and we're cramming it into a 72.

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       Ruby, how has that fit? Huh? How's that going to fit? Well, we're not taking the chassis and putting it over there and we were making our own and we've worked with Chris Austin on it also using that transmission, that independent suspension. Whoa. A independent rear. Got a video. You're a faggot. Isn't the 72 riviera like a million pounds. How much is the thing way? It's a lot, but we're clearing all of that out. We're working with a speed core and we're doing a lot of the tops going to be carbon fiber and so will the hood trunk and maybe even the full front clip speed core did a nasty 1970 Mustang for Robert Downey junior that I just saw online the other day with a supercharged coyote engine in it. Like a weird color to like a beige, like a weird kind of yellowish, funky, funky colors. The crazier the better.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       Yeah. I just let it. Like the art car is going to be like a weird, muted gray with a red and chrome and Carmen and I mean we're, we're getting pretty crazy with it. We were about halfway through, so it's a 72 boat tail Riviera CV and find one of those. I'm trying to picture that. I have. I had a riviera when I was in high school. No, I didn't have to skylar. So yeah. Here you go. Whoa. That's a stock one. But then it'll turn into what? Look at that. We just started chasing it. Yeah. So that's a, you know, a few people have built them into hot rods, but wow. If you stay on that video, it'll just feed to where what it's gonna look like when it's done. Oh, I see what you did. So you have. Oh Wow. That is crazy. It's gonna be nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       It'll probably be at sema this year in bare metal. Whoa. That's a beautiful car. Don't have wagon wheels on it. Like that stupid thing though. Yeah. I'm not a fan of those, those uh, that was a thing for awhile. That's going to be pretty, pretty bad ass. Pretty ass. Yeah. You don't see those now. You never see that car. Like that's a rare car now. And we found a one owner with zero hits, zero rust. I mean the metal launch. That's perfect. What are those Australian cars that were in Max now? Woo. Damn. That is going to look pretty nasty. It's going to be slammed like that and it's got to be nasty to. We're probably going to bring him in for around 1300 horsepower.

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       We're building that one just for sheer shits and giggles of her phone because nobody does that. Well. Someone who's going to want it for sure. I hope they have a lot of money. That's like a money pit right now. Yeah. How much does something like that cost to build? Three 50. Wow. Yeah. To build. And then how much would you like to make what you want to try to. I always try to make at least 20 percent. I mean, it's kind of a goal, right? But uh, that's reasonable. Yeah. Especially considering all the creative time and putting them together and yeah, we do everything in house. I mean it's, except for interior, we're doing every single thing in house now. I mean we've come a long way since the beginning. And when you have that kind of horsepower, what kind of rubber you're going to have on that thing?

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       Oh, it'll have 15 inches on each side. It'll have, I think we went with 24 hours and 20 twos and super, super wide. Wow. Yeah. You kind of have to. Right. And even then, it's probably gonna spin out everywhere now because we're using all the technology, we're using the independent suspension, we're using all of the sensors, all the stuff that's in that brand new vet application control as well. Wow. How do you adapt that over to an old car like that? You just go through the systems. We've got a guy working for us now that, uh, helped us run our standalone hill hellcat that they said couldn't be done when we were. We built a sharp cat and uh, so he just gets the whole thing and starts eliminating sensors or adding or, you know, and we ended up with all the same technology. So the sensors understand when a wheel spinning and then they compensated with breaks or horsepower breaks, you know, they'll get your stupid stupid light, you know, you can't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       You've got. So we'll be able to turn it all on and off. Just like a brand new car. Oh. So will you have different modes, like a race mode, street mode like that? Yeah. But what a lot of people try to do that I can't stand is they'll take the something with that idea and they'll go, okay, I'm just going to pull the body off and cram this under there and welded together and hope it works. And we make everything adapt to the old car. Still work though the way it's supposed to. And I'm brand new car. Yeah. I've seen, you know, there's a, there's a guy online that has, I'm on instagram gt 500 super swap. He took a, an old gt 500 body and put it on a gt 500 from a modern chassis and piece it together like that. But I was always thinking with a, with a setup like that, you probably can't have airbags, right?

Speaker 1:          00:26:34       You can. There's actually ways to added into there. But you get into the air. It is, yeah. You get into the geometry, uh, in the direction of the airbag. So beautiful. That looks so. Yeah. But you don't want to play with the R and d of trying to put an airbag into something like that unless you really, really know what you're doing because you don't know refraction of an inch off of, of being where it needs to be. That airbag could do more damage than good it. It's weird though because you're dealing with a totally different size body too. So I wonder how he's doing this. It's easy isn't. It? Doesn't sound easy, but it is, isn't really. Have you done that before? We haven't, but I, I, I understand the process and really it's just got massage, move in, move out, you know, because there's a company called Mag Motors.

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       You ever heard of them? I don't think I have. Go to a MAG motors.com. They have a. What they're doing is they're putting a carbon fiber body on a modern gt 500, but they're using a 67 like eleanor body, but they're making it out of carbon fiber. So it's a. That one's gross. Go to the silver. One white one looks to hate the eleanor body. So you're really overplayed. How dare you? It's just, it's just been done so many times, but who cares? It's amazing. Yeah. Go. Yeah, that's, those are the images, but go to get it, get it from the side so you get a better look at it. That's a beautiful car. See? To me it sits weird. It looks like it sits a little too high and it looks like they're worried, like I don't know anything about them, but to me looking at it it's like you need to get it down a little bit, get a little more agitated, get a deeper dish on the wheel.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       Um, well I think what they're doing is trying to use all the geometry of the modern car. Correct. So you ended up with something. It looks like it could go four wheeling a little bit, right? Yeah, it's not, it's definitely not slammed. Yeah. In terms of looks right. Yes. I mean I'm sure the car runs and drives and performs unbelievably, but it's missing a little to me it's missing some. Um, you know that our company, classic recreation's never seen them. No, I don't think so. They do. They're doing similar cars like that too. But they're doing it from the ground up. There's a lot of people doing it because it's with technology coming the way that it has, it's, it's not as hard to do as it used to be. Um, it's still the laborer's task, don't get me wrong, but you know, you can make all those systems work in anything and see a guy like you that's a car guy.

Speaker 1:          00:29:04       You look at an eleanor and you look at it like it's played, but a person who doesn't see them all the time, it was not in a car industry. When was the last time you saw one of those fucking things on the street? Shit, I would never say Jackson. There was like five of them for sale. That's the thing if you go there, but like fusion motorsports there, there are down the street here. They make, they're the only licensed dealers. They have some deal with the woman who was the, she was the wife of the guy who wrote, gone in 60 seconds or producing or something like that. And so they make a car, go to fusion. Eleanor. They make some pretty sick once. But you think there's a plate out personally? Yeah. I'm just not an eleanor car fan. That is fucking beautiful. Why do you hate America?

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       Richard? How could you, how could you not love that? It's just there's hundreds if not thousands of them out there. Come on, Bro. You must say to America, no way, man. Currently, and I love the mustangs. I've got three of them, myself included, a real 68 shelby. But uh, um, is it the shape or the color scheme? I think it's the shape. I mean, to me it's, it's such a popular car in the movie that, you know, too many people did it and now everybody's doing it and it's what have you. Yeah. But I mean, how many of them are out there in comparison to like say a modern Zr One? It was probably nearly as many of those thousands of those. I think so, yeah. There's different companies making tons of them all car people say that they say to cars that they think are played out 69 Camaro's and these things, like everybody does a 69 Camaro and everybody does.

Speaker 1:          00:30:40       Eleanor and the, um, the dukes of hazzard card. Oh yeah. Same thing. Yeah. Now a bad ass 69 charger. Don't get me wrong, but painted orange with a flag on top. That's played out. You can't do that anymore. That flag. It's fucking for sure. You believe they pulled that show off? The air did? Yes. Because the flag that shows off the showed on like some weird obscure cable. Jim pulled it off a TV land. That's TV land. I wrote a whole thing about it on Instagram, how ridiculous it was and I don't know if I agree with that. I mean it's like trying to erase history or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Well you live in Dallas though. It's a little easier to get by with a confederate flag and towels. Oh yeah. We don't have a bunch of Matcha tea drinkers and what have you like we do out here in California.

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       I, I, you know, living in Dallas, I have to do my business with the people out here in La and it's, you know, I'm getting off work before they've had their two chai lattes and walk their dog and showed up to the office. I'm like, come on guys, get up and get to work and I get accused of like, have you been drinking? And I'm like, yeah, it's 7:30 in the night here. I've been off for two and a half hours. People get upset at you if you've been drinking? No, when I'm trying to conduct some of the business calls that we do in the evenings because they haven't gotten to work yet. And they asked you if you've actually been drinking sometimes. Really? Well she's. Because they know you from the show. Well we all, I'm talking about my agents and managers networks and whatever. I'm like, yeah, because I've been off since 5:00 eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:32:15       Most people have a couple beers and sit around the shop. Well, most people there. Yeah. Yeah. It's a different world out here. A little bit of a culture shock. It is A. I don't, I don't know. I mean, I like it. It's okay, but I think if I was going to move a gas monkey anywhere, it would probably be Scottsdale. Scottsdale is nice. It's freaking cool. It's about a million degrees in the summer though. You ever go there? But it's a dry heat and sauna. It's fucking preposterous. We went outside. I was in the, it was in Phoenix last July and we went outside. We just stood there for a second. Oh, this is. This is ridiculous. We should get used to this because this is what global warming is going to be like an la a few years. Yeah. You guys are going to either be on fire from the, from the volcanoes or global warming or whatever or sliding into the ocean, but I really like Scottsdale.

Speaker 1:          00:33:06       Fun Fact. Next week they have any plan in the Scottsdale opening, the Waste Management Open in the celebrity program. Oh yeah. Do you golf? I absolutely suck at it horribly. I've been a member of the same country club for about 19 years and I probably played about 50 rounds of golf in my life and they've caught me playing in the pro am the celebrity thing and unlike we've ever gets teamed out with me as in big trouble. You're going to tighten up before you go. Are you going to take some lessons or anything? No Way, man. I'm sweating because. Because the way I look at it as, oh, I'm going to do. Then it's like be pissed off that I can't do what the guy told me to do. You're going to get much better. And then it's like what I tell them on it, but on top of that is I'm like, okay, you think you're so good at golf because you can shoot 72, you know, or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:33:53       Well, mathematically this is an 18 shot game, right? You can figure it out mathematically. Yeah. I mean if you had some insane ability. Well yeah, but you don't have to have in st ability to figure out the mathematics of it. So because it's an 18 shot game guys, but no one's ever done that. So how is it an 18 child game? Just mathematically is a one punch fight? Well, no, it's more like saying that because more fights are one punch fights than ever. A golf game is an 18 shot golf game. I'm saying mathematically propulsion direction, etc. And so forth. You cAn get that ball from that spot to that whole thing every time it's possible with enough power, right? Yeah. But in what have you. But that's literally like saying every fight is a one shot fight. No way. Why? Because a lot of fights are one shot fights, but there's never been an 18 hole game that's played with 18 shots, but there are whole ones.

Speaker 1:          00:34:51       So all you need is never happened. That was of the human race. I think the most I've ever done in an actual real tournament is to. Someone's done to I think somebody down. I'd have to look it up. But uh, Yeah. So one shot fight, they'd probably be, you fighting me, you just hit me and I'd go down. There's been quite a few in the that I've called one punch and the beginning of the fight, bam, someone gets hit and they go down at least three or four in the history of the fai. Duane ludwig like six seconds. First. First punch you through. That probably made me. We already talked about working out. So you're not to go down pretty quick. I can't believe you've never worked out ever in your life. I really haven't. I mean I'm just thinking about starting more, like just cardio and stuff. I turned 50 in two months so you know, I am a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       It's weird number, right? It's a weird number. plus I look at my dad and you know, he's 23 years old than me and I'm like, god, I got 20 years left. holy shit. Yeah. Well working out definitely holds off the grim reaper a little bit. Oh yeah. It keeps your body working better, but it takes effort. You got to be willing to do it. Well, like I said, I just hope things work out. Just hire a hot trainer. Hire a chick that's going to you. You'll be motivated. Who are embarrassed, you'll be embarrassed and that will get you motivated. is chicks like looking at me going, what is wrong with you, man? Are you kind of man? That is some embarrassing shit. What a chicken lift more than you. Yeah, well I'm sure there's a lot of. Oh, there's a lot of them. There's a lot of them around the block.

Speaker 2:          00:36:25       Yeah. Well, right around the corner is a giant fucking bodybuilding gym for chicks, for guys, for everybody. Right. It's just savages. I dunno. I like an athletic build on and grow, but I don't know if I want her to have giant muscles and yeah, there's a, there's a point I wanted to take bigger crunches than me. Yeah, there's a, there's a point where it gets creepy. There's like, um, yeah, rollover, holding her from behind little spoon and I'm like, oh, this set you joe veins, right? Like veiny forearms on chicks. Like something about some, about like veiny chest, like a girl with a veiny veiny pecs. Yeah. No, no, it's, it's a mistake. They're not supposed to have pecs anyways. Just that boobs. Yeah. But they have boobs combined with pack, so that's where it gets real weird when they have fake boobs, but they also have back muscles and you can feel the muscles underneath the fake boob. Like this water balloon that's floating on top of his cgu. Yeah, that's too crazy. That's one thing I do like about California. You know, the, uh, the southern California little blonde with all the tattoos and you know it. A little bikini on the beach. One ab. You take out those in Texas though? Not as many. They don't. Yeah, we got them, but not as many. I'm on instagram too much.

Speaker 2:          00:37:46       it seems like every girl from Texas on instagram has tattoos all over the place. Yeah. But that's, you know, there's 20 of them. Not 100, right? Yeah. Out here, this thousands. They're everywhere. Go to like venice Beach. It's hard to find a girl doesn't have a tattoo that's unique these days. That's a real rebel. Yeah. Girl with no piercings and no tattoos. It's either rebel or boring. Probably both. She's rebelling against being exciting. I think the girl bodybuilder though, what happens is people get into something and they forget how weird it is for everybody else. So as they get deeper and deeper into it, they just want to excel at it and they want to lift more weights and you know, they're trying to put more on the squat rack or they're dead lift in their neck gets big. And, and, and uh, I had

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       a girl that worked for me for a long time that was real into. She was like this. Uh, I don't know what competition she does, But it was body sculpting and stuff at this girls over there measuring florets of broccoli or to scale. That's when they fucked up. One little. Oops. Yeah. Once they start measuring their food and counting their macros, like settled down, once you're in some gigantic competition. Cheers. Cheers sir. Fixing breakout some tequila for you in a minute. Break it out, man. We have cups. Oh yeah. you brought cups to list. This guy comes prepared. Oh, you have gas monkey tequila. get the fuck outta here. You got your own tequila. Dude, can I get a gas monkey tee shirt? You have one I brought you on. I fucking love that logo. I got some of this crap down here. Did I put one on right now? I don't give a fuck to look at that. Ooh, got a couple of them here.

Speaker 1:          00:39:33       That jamie. Huh? Nice. Cool. Yeah. You guys have like a whole apparel line. Do we have everything? I mean we've got tools. We've got. I saw a bathmat the other day at like home goods or something and I'm like, I don't even remember it. Proven that is it for sure. Yours. it's a licensed product. Well that's part of the thing, right? You guys came up with a cool logo. Yeah. ANd the monkeys, you knoW, he's that lovable character that's also a pain in the ass and kind of in there messing stuff up all the time. But you can't shoot him because he's just, that's what he does. And What happened. So we did the gas monkey sentiment tequila. This is a, it's cinnamon. Yeah, it's a 100 percent blue. A gavi. Just swirled with a little bit of cinnamon and nice. My kids got a soccer game after this. I'm going to be fucked up time. Well salou, it's good way to get through the game. Yeah, for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:40:38       That's actually good. It's good stuff. Don't tell I'm ron white, but I think your tequila is better. He'll get mad. You get mad at me. He loves his tequila. We came up with this because this is the only tequila over finances made in America. Really? Because you have to do sco, you know, real blue golf. A tequila is always at your America from elise co to get around that. I ship it in and tankers and then I do it here. So we're switching built. Our distributors are just distillers right now and will be made in Texas. So you can't grow it in America. You can't grow the economy in America. You could, but a real tequila just like champagne in France, you know, real tequila is always from elise go area and what have you. How weird is that? It's like burgundy, right? These from your burrito burrito.

Speaker 1:          00:41:32       Exactly. But uh, that didn't, that's funny. I didn't, I, I kinda, I guess I kind of knew that. I didn't think about that. That's weird. Can make anywhere. We're literally sold out right now worldwide. Yeah, I took it to the troops. We went and did a deal with the px exchanges on all the bases in the world and they wiped me out and so we're having to make it right now. We're completely sold out everywhere. That's fucking great. I had to borrow a couple of bottles from somebody with hoarding them. That is a fucking dope logo though. That monkey with the tongue hanging out that you have that on the outside of your garage. You get a bunch of looky loos and find out where you guys are. Oh, we do it on purpose. We've got a little spot where people come by and see the cars.

Speaker 1:          00:42:15       We've got a building there and then we've got a a merch shop, and inside the mertz shop you can go in the back and there's like a party area where you can have a, don't sell beer or alcohol, but you can have a gas monkey energy drink or water and that will be like you're in the experience and you let people just come on down and say hi, get dressed. Yeah. Now everybody can come out. There's probably were on earth camera right now. Pull up earth cam, gas monkey. We can see how many people are there. Do you get stopped by weirdos because of the tv show? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what really freaking sucks in Texas. This is no bullshit. I didn't find this out until we got random. What really sucks. Somebody comes on my property and they're weird and I got to tell them to leave or they're aggressive or whatever and I'll get the hell off the property.

Speaker 1:          00:43:03       Get out of bed for the next 24 hours. I'm responsible for them if they like, if they leave and get run over at the corner or whatever because I made them leave. I forced them from the property. They're my responsibility. What? It fucking sucks. So if a guy shows up drunk and you say, hey man, you gotta get the fuck out of here, and the guy leaves and gets in a car accident, he could say, hey, they made me leave. Yeah. You know, so the drunk ones, I'll put them in an uber, but I'm talking about just the crazy ones. You know, we've got a homeless problem in dallas. It's starting to get to be about as big as you guys are having here. And they'll wonder onto property and were like, hey, you got to beat it. And then if they go down the street and gets hit, yeah, I'm responsible for their medical bills can be.

Speaker 1:          00:43:49       It's the stupidest freaking law and the planet. What waS that like a hospitality law, like what's, I don't sell alcohol, but it's because I'm a business and I've made them leave. They came to see me and I made them leave. They didn't leave on their own accord, so we have to call the cops to get them to carry those people out. That's so weird. I went to jay leno's garage and he's telling me that, uh, you know, jay leno's garage, not jay leno's garage. Jaylin was 11 garages. Oh, I know. I've been there. I've done the jay leno show. It's written daisy. I mean, I knew that guy was a car nut, but I didn't know the magnitude until you go and you see these 11 warehouse buildings, just full, full cars. He's got a real problem now. He's got a great problem. He's a great problem.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       I'm only up to two buildings. I need to start adding buildings. How many cars do you personally own? Um, iT's hard to answer because I've owned gas monkey and so we have inventory. I have to, I tell everybody, I usually keep between 50 and 60 cars that are yours that are sort of for sale, you know? So there's some comes along, man, I need that car. and you're like, there's a map, there's about 10 that I won't sell, period. What won't you sell? I won't sell my thomas crown affair mustang shelby a couple. What Is that? A year? 60 eight. You could probably find a picture of that on the net, but it's a, it's a remake of the one they used in thomas crown affair with pierce bronson when he's on the Island and it's got all the. I never saw that moment. It's all lifted on bf goodrich.

Speaker 1:          00:45:16       Never seen appears bronson movie a dude. Thomas crown affair is a remake of another thomas crown affair movie. And uh, uh, the mustangs just wicked cool. So I had a client, a friend of mine had me build it for him, good friend. and I wanted the car. Of course I couldn't afford it then. We didn't even have the tv show yet. And so I built in this perfect rendition. 60 eight shelby convertible mustang. Put bf goodrich is on it, raised it all up high. I mean it's perfect California cruiser. And uh, then when I got the show I call him up and I go, hey, can I borrow the car buddy? Cause I want stuff sitting around the shop that, that I built. I don't want other people'S stuff here. He goes, oh yeah, man. Just sit in the truck down to pick it up.

Speaker 1:          00:45:57       This is three years later. I send the truck down. It gets back. The cars got 42 miles on it. It's been sitting there doing nothing in his garage. He's down in new orleans, so it's got some of that haze and shIt from the salt air and gas is there. It is. The gas is bad. Oh wow. That is really high. It looks like you're going four wheeling in that fucking thing. What is going on with the tire on the trunk? That's the spare. Um, I know, but it's, that's an odd placement. That's just how it wasn't a movie. Really? Yeah. Wow. And uh, god, leah, my fat there are. What is that? You? I don't know. I don't know. That's not the one I built that, that's another guys car. So I'm just not quite right. Mine is more absolutely perfect to the movie. That's somebody else's rendition of it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:44       Um, but anyways, I called my buddy, I go, let me borrow the car, et cetera. It gets there with 42 miles on it after three years it doesn't run. The gas Is bad. Carpenters all fucked off and of course I called him and go, you're really shitty car owner. I said, this thing is freaking bad ass. Look what you've done to it. Well, he has a considerable amount of money, so the next day the title shows up in the mail and he goes, you're right. I'm a shitty car owner. Chairs. He gave it to you. Jesus christ. It helps to have a close friends that have a lot of cash. Massage, obviously like you to god. We're real good friends. He's. He's a. He's a bad motherfucker. Well, I want to see what it actually looks like without the fat guy driving. No disrespect fat guy. Yeah, looking at it Because I could see where if you don't work out at all, how do you stay thin?

Speaker 1:          00:47:32       Because you're a thin guy. I got. It's just metabolism. I do eat right. I don't eat fast food, but you drink. I don't do sodas. I haven't done sodas or anything like that and two decades. And how often do you drink every day? DoeSn't that cancel out all the uh, no. Sodas? I don't know. I mean maybe it says it doesn't have as much sugar, but you must have like a beer drinkers metabolism. You just, you know how to do it. Yeah. It's, it takes a lot of practice to get to this point. Your body's ready. I'm ready to go the fuck to do. I was like a marathon runner. Like everybody can't run fucking 15 miles a day with someone who runs 50 miles a day. Can do it. Yeah. I, I, there's, that's one thing that's just monotonous to me running my, uh, my wife's a runner and a, I'm like, that's just silly.

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       Like why do you want to get out and go run 20 miles? I don't run 20 miles, but I run hills a run for four is the most I run, but I run like pretty steep hills. There's your car, is that the one that's the same fat guy right there, jamie. There's a couple versions of it and a lot of the websites are pulling. Dropped down to the one right below that. Where your cursor that there is, that's the real one. It's that one right there. Yeah, that's a not zero and yeah, it was a nice car. It's so much fun and I a bang in stupid sound system in it. So you know, it'd be borrowed the whole deal. It'd be a great carter cruise around California. What kind of engines you put in that thing? Just the typical small buckets of gt 3:50.

Speaker 1:          00:49:05       So it's got a small block, three or two and um, what have you. it's a pretty fun time. We get to a lot of heads. And then we were talking about cars. I wouldn't say I got that. I got a 52 fleet line. That was the first car we ever built as gas monkey garage. What does a fleet land? I don't even know what that is. It's a, you can type in 52. Fleet line gas monkey. It's a, the fastback version of [inaudible]. Fifty two chevy kinda has the slope back. Some people call it a torpedo back. A look at that thing. Yeah. The not that one. The picture on the far corner. Yeah. That's us. And uh, it's all patina it out and kind of, you know. Oh, so you kept it like that? Yeah. That was the original body. We chopped it though and it's got a, uh, people love that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       Like the original patina it out body, like I'm icon does that, they call them derelicts. That's a good picture of the car. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Derelicts. And then we got a lead ops we have, I got my first car I ever bought. I won't sell that as part as the first one I ever bought for me. What is it? Five, nine, nine gtb 2009. Oh, that's a nice car. Super good car. And uh, you know, then I had a couple of other friends but I'd probably sell those, but that one first one just probably never will. And just because it's like a benchmark, like you, I'm a big proponent and believer in forcing yourself, you know, and so forth sell it to, to want more to do more, to, to give yourself motivation. A lot of people just save and save and save and I'm more like, okay, I'm going to do something that I probably shouldn't do right now so that I know I got to work hard to make sure I don't have to give it up.

Speaker 1:          00:50:39       I'm wiTh you. Yeah, that's me. I talk my friends into that shit. I talked to my friend tony into buying a corvette when he can't afford it. Taught my friend brendan and about a gt three rs. So it's the same thing. I mean, I bought the car when I probably shouldn't, but the show was going and I was like, this will make me work hard on this, you know, it sits in the corner when I'm doing it. I get up in the morning, I look at it, I got it. I got to make sure that I can afford that, so let's go do it too. And I believe in that wholeheartedly and people say you're ridiculous. And I go, yeah, yeah, exactly. Well, when I was young, I was a. When I first got into printing and advertising at shit, I could barely make rent.

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       I think I was buying my suits it, you know, a resell shop, but I would go to neiman's and look around and you know, and, and think about what I was going to buy it. Just putting the motivation in my head, you know, I guess there's a big movement now with making your imagination board or whatever. Well, those people are assholes. Yeah. My shit just wanted to reel in your head that I had that vision board. I get it. If you're 20 and you're doing that, you don't know any better. My vision boards, you know, the old poster of the rock band with his weed and you know, it looks like a great mission. Yeah. That's the real vision board. I, yeah. I, I'm a big believer in doing this is what I say to someone who can buy. If you can actually buy a ferrari.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       I'm like, listen man, if you don't, who will, if you're an 18 year old kid and you got no money, and he said, man, find enough to buy a ferrari. Oh god, I'd be so happy I'd buy that thing. Well, you should do it if you can. You can. You should do it. And is it, is it too much money? Yeah, it's, it's definitely too much money. That's part of the whole part point of the whole thing. Correct? Yeah, it's, it's. To me, I use it more as motivation. I know, can I afford this? And then if you. If terrell chef. No, you go, well then I'm going to. I'm going to afford it to figure it out. Exactly. I feel that way about everything. So do I. That's been my mantra forever. That's people are like, oh, you know, you got lucky. I worked my fucking ass off my whole life.

Speaker 1:          00:52:39       Well you definitely got lucky. He didn't get hit by a meteor. You got lucky for a lot of things. Lucky he didn't get home invaded. You got a lotta lotta luck. Luck. But I'll tell you your, your, your past guests of mr. Elan musk there, he kind of ruined it for us because now we actually have a possibility of getting in a car wreck and space. Yeah. You could get in a car wreck and space because that car is just floating around out there. What if that car slams into a fucking alien? Spaceships is coming to save us and elon musk just frivolously shot that fucking thing in the orbit. He did. He just shot it up there and they'd let him with a robot sitting in the front seat. You know? We were joking around about like, what if that guy in the front seat is actually a guy who fucked his wife and he decided to kill that guy and stick him in a fucking space suit. Shoot him into orbit. See, I don't get that. Why do you want to be at the guy if he does that? You got to be mad at your wife. I agree. I'm with you on. I'm with you on that to be mad. If I came home and a dude who's banging my wife, I will listen bro. I get it. You go, you gotta go. You're to.

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       Depends on what he looks like too. I mean, if he's like aqua man to her, I'd tell her I get it. Yeah. Sometimes you got to do that. Yeah. But uh, but uh, yeah. Oh, we're going again going again, bro. This doesn't. This devil sneak up on you. I could getting snuck up on since the eighties. Solute per. Ooh. It's so good though. It is good. It's smooth. I like the cinnamon too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And it's funny drink for a real tequila enthusiasm though. Is that like sacrilege? Is that like an electric mustang? Oh yeah. But that's what the monkey has always done. You know, it's like a play on the golf thing. I decided to launch gas monkey golf apparel line and so I'll be wearing a golf shirt out there and It's pretty crazy. It's got a skull and all kinds of crap or whatever. But uh, where I'm pushing the envelope as the monkey is, our tagline is snap and teas and filling holes.

Speaker 1:          00:54:43       Now when you bring that to the country club, do people say, sir, that attire is unforgivable here. Oh yeah, for sure. I've been thrown out of my own country club plenty of times. He really. And I've bought a lot of golf carts because I've crashed because I thought it was fun and thrown out of your own country club a bunch. It's really for what? Just raising too much hail, you know, almost like the old rodney danger movies, you know, it's like, sorry, you can't do that in here. And I was like, oh, I'm going to do it twice. Caddyshack all time. Exactly. Yeah. Now what did they say to you? Just, you know, they usually just take me home because I live on the course, so they'll drop me down there. So you, you have a house on the course? I did. I lived downtown in dallas now.

Speaker 1:          00:55:26       But uh, I'm the worst one was I decided to drive my harley home on the golf course. One grass. No, I stayed to the cart path. I'm not a complete asshole. but uh, I did drive it home at about 1:30 or two in the morning in my house is probably the furthest house from the clubhouse. And that thing is frigging loud when you're in that, you know, this trench of a golf course. Right. The cops were waiting on me when I got home, but thank god they were reading the cops. I was like, you can't do anything. I'm going inside fate. Golf course cops. Yeah. Yeah. You know, the community cops, community cubs. That's adorable. I had a good one for you. I actually got arrested at this country club. Well, at my house for it. I wouldn't say arrested Because they ended up letting me go, but they did come cuff me and put me away. Um, the um, we're coming home uh, from a christmas extravaganza, which I do with my buddies every year. Right before christmas we get a big garden pile in and we go christmas shopping

Speaker 3:          00:56:23       for our families and what have you coming home loaded. I supposedly through a burrito from taco bell or something and hit the guard. So there's four, three or four of my buddies. We get to my house, we pig out on shitty taco bell food, you know, until everybody passes out. And the next thing I know the cop lights are on banging on the door, get out of here. I come to the door going, hey, why? You know, after you've been drinking, did you do a bunch of food? You're fucking gone. And uh, so long story short, they said, well, you're going to be arrested for assault if you don't get at it and say you're sorry to this guy salt with a burrito. Correct. Right. And by the, so if you charge a man with a salt because he throws a burrito at you, you should, you should turn in your card.

Speaker 3:          00:57:10       But if we were to tape it was not like throwing it at him. It's not like I've barely with a baseball right here. I like chunked it to him to eat, but he didn't see it coming and so I slapped him and Fell down. So they cuffed me. They take me down to the guard house. Yeah, they put me in the back of the cop car coffeecake oh, these are real. It's so real. Yeah. He fileD a report and so this is how stupid it gets shaped by then. I'm so fricking loaded. Right. And I get there and the burrito stiLl on the ground, I'm like, it's evidence or some shit. And they're telling me I got to apologize to this guy and all I can focus on is there's a perfectly good vegan burrito. I'm going to eat this burrito. So sit down and literally start eating the burrito and you're like, please just tell her you're sorry.

Speaker 3:          00:57:53       So you go back home. And I'm like, okay. So I tell him I'm sorry I'm still eating a burrito and they just left me there like a mile from my house at the. You walked home with mild drug. Do you see the guy since then? Oh gosh, no. I was like, dude, that was perfectly back. This was in the days before the sprinters are so popular. So it was like a stretch limo, which is, you know, you just really don't ride it anymore. And I was like, that's a hell of a shot. Came out of the back window, 120 inches up to the front, hit the gas squared, the fucking chest. I should get a medal for that. Assault might be a plus in here. Assault with a burrito is probably the first time we've had that. And you're a little a podcast room. I definitely think it's the first time it seems like you'd just be able to say, hey, I just throw it to you because I was drunk.

Speaker 3:          00:58:44       I thought you were hungry. This is really what it was. This is what I mean. You can hear me on the video going, hey, you want a burrito? And uh, it was pretty ridiculous. The guy got a bankcard yang for sure. Yeah. What someone calls us salt, like how dare you. Some people get beaten to a pulp and you call him a taco bell burrito flying your way. That thing costs a dollar 99 dude and it's barely meet. We were going over like how much of a ruling on how much meat. It actually has to be where you can call it a beef burrito, but there's fillers

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       in that shit. Like what is the filler was like silicone or something like that. But it's something ridiculous like 34 percent of it is not actually meet. That's why. I mean that was 10 years ago, 80 percent for the internet. They can pretend it's me. Well, the cool thing, taco bell now starting to open all their ones up with bars inside there. What? Yeah. Well that's good for business to get people more drunks. I don't care where the food tastes. Exactly. Get them all tanked up, feed them some burritos and send them on their way. Haven't even taco bell in decades. It's been since then I have some real legitimate because we're in la. You're in Texas, but there's legit mexican places near you, I'm sure. Oh yeah, but like there's legit tuckerias here where you know, you go in there and mexican soap operas are playing.

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       Nobody speaks english. You got to a point this shit and say thing. You gotta roll your r's language. Language idea. Yeah. You to speak the lingo. See I can't do the linguists stuFf that. The tongue, right? Yeah. I can't do the shit. Don't ever have it. I have tried everything. I mean. Oh man. You gotta try elk tongue tacos. I just. Why For fucking delicious. So good. It's the, it's the most. One of the most tender meat you could ever have. Like the most tender Pot roast ever. Really. It's amazing. If I ever get a chance, there's a place right here on canoga, like maybe a few miles away from here. How good is that place, jamie? When I come to California, I'm not trying to get some elk tongue. I promise you. Well, I'll help tons in the freezer. But the cow tongues what they have out here.

Speaker 1:          01:00:56       Yeah. Calton elk tons mined. But a language case, ideas, you know, you don't fuck with that language talk. No, and I don'T do the uh, whatever that milk drink is, what do they call it? Oh, horchata. Yeah. Know which hat is rough because you know, there's no fucking safety standards that no one knows what's in there. It's like really shitty eggnog and eggnog is shitty. It's at least six percent is too at, for sure, depending on who's working there and how disgruntled. Yeah. Um, but you do cardio sada right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've got a, I've got a couple of bars and restaurants down in Texas and so we sell a lot of tex mex. Fusion tex mex is a different kind of flavor. It's a different thing. yeah. Like people that don't know, like a what a keto is, you know, like case.

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       Oh, in Texas it's like a staple. Correct. Yeah. Out here. No one knows what the fuck case. Oh is he? I want to get some and chips. So like what the fuck are you talking about? Any trade shows does a few places. Okay. So legit. A real good legitimate lotus and the corn with the a's and the. Yeah. Cream in there. I could get doWn on some of that for sure. Texas is a different fucking country. It really is. Well it where I'm at now in dallas, uh, literally I can go to the corner gas station and there's a lady there just saw on the corn off the cob and puts it in the styrofoam cup and squirts all the crap in there and I can make

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       myself sick on that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. There's tea. I'm wondering what texts y tex mex is so much different because there's no California max. Right. But tex mex is. I would never allow that word to be said anyway. California max is probably just pissed off. Seventy 2000 people. That's just a regular podcast. He said, California mix. Try ordering. Lat line is Mexico asshole and he's stolen from the mexicans. Exactly. know what do you think about this wall? Bullshit. Opening little. Those poor people in here give them jobs. I don't give a fuck. tax it. Yeah. I. I mean I don't want criminalS. I don't want criminals coming through. How do we filter out gang members and criminals? Just. I wish there was a way to tell there was a way that there's not. I wish there was a way to tell whether someone's a piece of shit and a criminal. I wish there was and or someone just poor because there's a lot for sure. Both sides are right. This is how I look at it. For sure. The people that don't want criminals coming in here or. Right. For sure. the people that want border control to keep out gang members and drug dealers and evil people there. Right? 100 percent. Look, I'm. I'm a fucking american taxpayer. I have a family. I fucking salute, right?

Speaker 2:          01:03:46       I, I believe in the law. I believe in all those things, but also my, my grandparents were immigrants. All of them, everybody that I that is related to me came over from europe. They all came over from Italy and Ireland. All of them. They all came over because their livestock, they want a better place. If someone walks here from Guatemala, they don't walk here because they're lazy. They walk here because they want a better life. This kid, america's made for it, so I say let them in. I say let him into, but I wish there was a better way to screen out the ones. If there was a better way to screen out the real shitty human beings to stop that would be. That would be ideal. We need to cut screener screeners. The way to go. I'm going to tag that doesn't exist right now.

Speaker 2:          01:04:32       One of my people are listening. Make sure you buy that whole thing that all these fucking government workers are getting paid right now because of a wall. Oh jesus. And this is a billionaire. Donald, you believe in the wall that much. Take $5 billion out of your fucking account. Shove those shackles towards the billion. How much do they have anything? They say he's got three, but it's all paper. I think you're right. It's like smooth ones and zeros somewhere. It's like his hair, but you know what? We elected him. We got to deal with it. Yeah. Yeah, and in our case he was the better choice, so he was a better choice of this is why he's the better choice because to realize that our system is completely hosed it like

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       that. This guy could get in there and build that wall, lock her up and everybody's like, check. It's. It's a. It's a good. It's a good example of how our system is the best, best system in the world for sure. This whole experiment and self government is the best on the planet earth, but without a doubt. But this guy, it's not his fault. That is who he is, but he exploited it. He showed everybody. He showed everybody the holes in this fucking goofy system. I know, but he's a reality star and that can be president one day and you could you and me the ticket, if logan rawlings ticket, we, we could win and I'm not bullshitting. You know, we could, when I could do that too. They did some fucking vegas odds and they found out that I have better chances of winning then a lot of people. That would be fricking rad. Yeah. There's like a whole list of people who had better. Just like throwing them out.

Speaker 3:          01:06:18       I got this, but it's, you know, I mean no one's gonna work. The most fun in that I'm having, right? This second is not even in this room, so I'm managing my pr person or back there to fuck up on talking about politics. See, I don't have one of those. My manager is awesome and my pr person is nonexistent. So let's get round three going. Let's go. Here we go. Salute. Salute. Marika. Marika. Woo. I'm telling you, it just keeps getting better. Yeah, it does. Keep getting better. Good whiskey or tequila or whatever the fuck it is. I forget now. Yeah, to politics or the. That is the one thing that people say you shouldn't talk about, but I like, isn't that what helps us to talk about it? It's just that people are so fragmented. People fragment out everything you say. And they're like, well, you know, it's like, it's like you said something, but then they turned it into this one little sentence going, wait a second. He said these two scripted averages in this fucking noun and verb and look at what he said. He said, screening. Yeah, you heard him. I told my pete, what about cut screening.com.

Speaker 3:          01:07:31       I don't know what I'm going to do with it, but we're going to use it. Well, if we could just figure out a way to put microchips and everybody will know everybody is what everybody did and that way we'll know if you're a cut. He walked past this little thing and it goes beep. You'll walk by. He throws burritos, but he's a good guy. I'm going to get 50 cars a. Well, a lot of them are for sale, but uh, we have some pretty cool stuff in there. Um, but I'm a big 32 ford guy, so I've got all the 30 to 40. What is 32 four. Why does that one? Because that's like, um, to most guys like myself. Anyways, that's what started the hot rod movement. They were cheap. They were plentIful. The guys came back from ww two and you know,

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       they bought a $20 32 ford and stuffed v eight in it and that became the hot rod scene and right because like in 47, 32 ford was like the old used car that he bought that thing for like 20 bucks and maybe even 10 or five, you know, now we're paying $50 for one that needs everything. What was your fIrst car? my first car was a 73 mercury comment. My first car was a [inaudible] 73 chevelle. Well that's way cooler than a pIss green mercury comet. I promised last I drove it from, the guy bought it from, I got it home and the next day the engine blew. That's operator error. No shit box. It was just terrible that a six cylinder straight six cylinder. So it wasn't fast, it wasn't cool, it was, it was piss green from the seventies and it was pea green interior and uh, you know, the ladies didn't like it and it had the squeaks and stuff, you know, going, I'd be pulling into high school and going over the speed, but I was like, shit, this is not cool at all.

Speaker 1:          01:09:24       But by the time I graduated, because I always worked hard, mowed yards, rake leaves, whatever I could do. Um, I was a hustler. So by my senior year I was driving a 77 bandit, trans am. Woo. Now the lady started paying a little more attention. That's legit. Those cars are still legit. Those bandit trans ams, that movie just revolutionized trans ams. It revolutionized a cars in movies when you had burt reynolds on your car, on your show, rather. I have to say that I got sad when I saw him walk out. I was like, oh man, that's burt reynolds baggies that broken down. You know, he was really bad broken down at that point in time, but towards the end of his life, he came back kind of full circle. He was a whole different kind of person about a year and a half, two years later, how, I don't know, but he, I don't know if he was just going through a bad spot, but towards the end he was hip.

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       Cool. We did a lot of different things together that you'll see a real, you know, and uh, what have you. But the cool thing that not a lot of people know in my office, I have the hat, the hat with all the feathers and the, and the what have you. Yeah. So when I was filming at his house, he comes out, he goes, hold on a second, how I get you something. And he goes in, comes back out, and he goes, I didn't ever know who I was going to give this to as the fuck. It's not that one. It's the one from smoking vent to. But um, that is to um, well fuck it too much. He is sitting in there and I've got a picture of him giving it to me. And um, I had like man tears. I mean, I had like, my hair was growing on my arms and stuff, but, you know, standing up and I'm like, dude, I can't take that. And he goes, oh, you will. And I'm like, okay, let me just going to tell burt reynolds know. And uh, so sits there

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       as kind of a memorial and he was a super cool guy and he was really a car guy and, but also there it is. And he was just giving you his hat and shit. Yeah, he was a bad ass man. I mean he didn't have a cane at this point in time. So whatever it was that he, he must have some surgery or something like that. It was, I don't think so. I think it was just frail at the time. Um, and he, yeah, he was, this was four years ago maybe. And now, um, you know, he just passed away. But uh, he, he came around, you know, he does the barrett jackson and stuff wIth us and uh, I've got a friend of mine that owns company restorative muscle car that does, uh, just transient type stuff. And it was cool those smokey and the bandit years were when I was in highschool, 81, I was a freshman in high school.

Speaker 3:          01:12:04       I was 84, so I remember watching those, watching those movies and, and saying like, this guy, he's like having fun, smiling. And he was like, he was silly. That's the secret to get smoky. I'm fucking having a blast. It's not a big fucking deal. Um, and, and did you look at all the other ones that people don't talk about? A lot like hooper or stroker ace, you know, not to mentIon cannon ball and all the other ones. I mean they were literally a group of guys that kind of took our overhaul. He would for a small period of time and just had a blast. Just had good times. they were like, hey, this might be fun to go film this movie for two weeks across America and fuck shit up. Let's go do It. All right, cool. Well he was just silly. He was always smiling and silly. And he had. Jackie gleason was the enemy. Like, come on man. What do you got? Jackie gleason is the evil guy, man, you got a goddamn great movie. That's silliness. I need a dr. Pepper.

Speaker 3:          01:13:03       Yeah. And diablo sandwich and make it a fast. I'm an ra. I mean it was just. I mean, jackie gleason from the hustler is a bad guy in a, a, a cop movie. You so bitch. Those are great. Fucking sally fields is the girlfriend. I mean it was just fucking amazing, man. You go. I'd love those movies, man. Dude. And getting to shave and my goatee often and dress like that and, and do the show that I did was absolutely second to none. I'm like, this is as cool as it gets. You know, I, I'm done. Cool. I do with that car. Did you sell it? You have. We actually gave it away on discovery. Oh really? Yeah. So somebody's got it. It's a good car. It was really nice car. Great looking car man. God damn those old. Those trans ams from that year that with the firebird on the fucking hood. God there. So as heavy though, man. I mean to. You can't. It doesn't matter how good a driver you are. That thing is asked heavy. It'll come around on you in a heartbeat. Of course. Mine, I bought a. My dad was actually, they said my

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       parents told me that I couldn't get it because they said they couldn't afford the insurance and everything and they didn't know I was always hustling and doing stuff and what have you. So I just showed up at home one day with it and they were like, we told you, I said I paid cash and I paid for a year's where the insurance up front. And they were like, my dad's like, where the fuck did you get that money working? He goes, how much money you got? RIght. So I take him to a room. I showed him my shoe box and he's like, which is more than I make will we do to make that money? Oh dude. I was a hustler back then selling car stereos out of my truck, you know, so anything anybody would buy, raking leaves, mowing yards. I mean, I was kind of a geeky kid at the time and a little bit on the small side, so I had a lot of free time.

Speaker 1:          01:14:55       I wasn't exactly banging the cheerleaders or anything, so I knew I'd just always kind of was a hustler. Wanted to make money and how to respect that. Oh, he did. He did. He was, he was actually very impressed. He was like, he goes, he goes, we don't have that much in our family bank account. Wow. You know. And uh, I was like, well, that, you know, and uh, but my dad was a, it is a phenomenal dude. Worked three years, uh, you talk about a good dad, you know, you're a dad. And so my, but a good dad. I mean, my mom left when I was two, ditched my dad with me at two and my sister at six or so and uh, you know, it was the seventies. So you would think that, uh, my dad would be like, I'm going to smoke this weed and drive away.

Speaker 1:          01:15:44       But instead he buckled down and got, got two jobs and worked. He worked two jobs Pretty much my whole life and provided for us and we defInitely didn't have much, but we had a roof and we had food and shit. He's still in contact with your mom now? Not really. I hate to say that, you know, but mom's, uh, she lives down in Florida. I'm sure she's a whatever she is, but a little too much for me. The exact opposite story. Oh yeah, yeah. My mom left my dad when I was five and I haven't even spoken a word. My dad went on til from seven years old on no kid. Yeah. Well I've actually, I've kept up with my mom and we talked about every two or three years and it reminds me of why I don't talk to her anymore. So then I'm good.

Speaker 1:          01:16:31       I'm sure if I met my dad would be the same thing, but I have a stepdad. He's a great guy. I got real lucky. I had a stepmom and it didn't turn out super great, but she did teach me a little bit about math and you know, to how to run books because she was basically a thief. But so I at least learned for the explosion one step mom until I moved out of house until I was out of high school. yeah. then my dad went on to marry like a series of super, really fricking just eft up individually. He just started running through them and I was like dad, married, any of them come with

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       two or three of them about people to get married like five, six, seven times. I, I respect that. This is what I respect. I respect people that keep fucking swinging, you know, even though you go down and the fifth, you know, you get back up and you go down the six go down to the seventh there, you know, my dad was like that. He was like, ah, it's fucking good party. So come on out and I'm getting married. You know, he had one wife one time. I get there for like family christmas on either christmas eve or whatever. It's like going to the dad's house with the young kids and what have you. And we get there and she's all doped up on, you know, whatever pills were popular at the time. And she's like, hey, can I take your shirt off? Oh yeah. When she's crawlinG around on the floor and try and take off her clothes and the whole family sitting there like, what the hell Is this dad? And so now he's, uh, he's in, uh, uh, an alzheimer's home. But, but, uh, yeah, that's the part of what's scary about turning 50. But he's like in, they're nailing all these chicks. We come, we go in there and he's like making out with some girl with a nasal cannula on and carrying her oxygen bottle. And he's convinced that they've been married for a few.

Speaker 3:          01:18:31       I have a bin in my act about the outbreak of stds in nursing. It's out of control. It's viagara. Oh, it's not only just that, these people, I mean, I mean my dad has really advanced alzheimer's and he knows that he misses his mustang. Uh, I took all those bicycles away and I need to get laid. That's it. And he's in there just running around with it. If we got called my sister and I take care of my data in that manner. And so we get called to tHe home, almost like being called to the principal's office as a, as a parent. They're like, your dad'S literally in here. Fucking everybody literally had the feeling of getting janked in there to the, to the principal's office. Like Your kids. Fuck up your, your dad's fucking. But you had to be proud of what do y'all care?

Speaker 3:          01:19:34       That's my point. That's What I say about him in my acts like, come on man. How do you want these people die out? What? Their hardest top where they're playing. Bingo. Yeah, have a good time. Just don't want him hurt each other. We'll see. I mean, I'm in the healthcare business also home health care. And so I know, yeah, I've got a lot of different ventures. But what, what do you in how you in the home healthcare business, a home health care with, uh, with my wife. Uh, we 16, 17 years ago, maybe longer. uh, so in the state of Texas, it's probably the second or third largest home health care. But I'm talking a real home healthcare. Like you got to get shots, you've got to get therapy, you got, these are trends that are going in and they're not people you go into bathe grandma, what is your business?

Speaker 3:          01:20:14       You hire a bunch of nurses to take care of people that are at home. Yeah, it's prescribed, uh, like through medicare or insurance or whatever to where maybe somebody gets a knee or a shoulder replacement or maybe it's an injury or cancer or what have you. And so it's a very rewarding business. We probably have 3000 to 2,500, 3000 patients at any given time all around the state of Texas. And uh, so it's, uh, it's, it's a fun business to be in that you're really getting help people. But at the same time, that shit out there, it's crazy. These guys are, they're getting after it. He'd go into the nursing home and it's like, damn, dude, this 78 year old dudes had more ass than I had last week.

Speaker 3:          01:21:02       Yeah. Why not? Why not? Why not? My thought is why not? Well, I bought my dad a, you know, he's got his room. That's kind of like an apartment or whatever. And I bought him stripper sheets are not stripper sheets, but uh, a twister, twister sheets with all red and blues and greens and I hug a board thing up behind his bed. I'm like, dad, if you're getting after you guys will have fun. I mean fuck bingo or freaking whatever. SO when, because he has alzheimer's, does he remember when he gets after it? I think it said he's just so focused on and he just, he was kind of, what would you call him? Accustomed nuba. he was, he, my dad got some serious ass my whole life. I mean as a teenager I was like god damn it as like bang and everything. But when your wife leaves you with kids when you're young, you just realize, okay, forget about this longterm shit.

Speaker 3:          01:21:52       Yeah, let's just enjoy the moment. Yeah. But I mean my dad was straight up products of the sixties and seventies, you know, so he, he like dyed his hair blond and his eyebrows blonde and shit. Walk around looking like matthew mcconaughey. Dazed and confused. Alright, alright. I'll try driving his mustang. You know, can come pick me up from school, what kind of back then it was like a 72 fast back, you know, red and black with a four speed and he'd be hammering it and I'm like, you know, five, six years old of age, I'd fall on the floor because nobody wore a freaking seatbelt back then. And uh, his idea of afterschool care was the skating rink because he knew that thing. It'd be open till nine, so drop us off at the skating rink and ninety nine cent corn dog meal and uh, he come pick us up usually around 10 or 11 and with some irate skating rink owners sitting there pissed off and like, wow, he was a bad ass. It is a bad ass still. I mean, he's nailing chicks in a nursing home. Come on. It's so weird when You become an adult, isn't it? Oh yeah. You know, when you think about, oh, round four, we got to drink water from rawlings, raymond rawlings, Raymond Miller, rawlings mother fucker. That ever lived. So I looped for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:23:12       I mean, I guarantee you he got more acid than you and I did this all week. I believe it. He's freaking probably banging one right now. it's like, hey, what's that noise in the back? Sounds like my son is the tv plus the goal. the goal is like, or the bonus rather is that they can't get pregnant. You got that mean it's over. Yeah. Well that's uh, that's not happening, but you can still get some diseases and stuff. And they do. Yes they do. But the thing is where they getting them. Well somebody had it and then the next thing you know, all 100 people in that building have done it right. But did they have it already or they're getting it from the building now. They had it already. He had already. So you're dealing with herpes or you're dealing with the real weird ones like syphIlis and gonorrhea and shit.

Speaker 3:          01:23:58       The syphilis and gonorrhea is like, hey, you got to treat thIs. Where are you getting this? Oh no, it's, it's, it's prevalent. It's everything. Right. But the question is, are they getting it from outside sources? Maybe. Maybe. I mean, who knows yet that, that, that uh, unfortunately they just had the baby, you know, that it's been invalid for a 20 something years. That's crazy. Somebody, somebody dr. F and I'm trying to. Two thousand 11 chlamydia infections amongst americans. 60 five and over. Increased by 31 percent and syphilis by 52 percent. Yeah. But the problem with that is 52 percent. All right. Okay. Let's say there's 100 cases and then the next year there's a 150. Alright. That's 52 percent. No big tins of that $100. Million? Yeah, a million thousand. My dad's probably in their gun. Come on baby. I'm going to buy some though. I don't like the number of percent because if there's four people and then the next year there's six.

Speaker 3:          01:25:00       That's 50 percent increase. And what I'm saying, I don't like numbers like that because you could make. Oh my god, it's an epidemic I want, I want, I want numbers like human beings. Yeah. Well I'm sure it's out there on the web, but like I said, my dad's probably thinks committee as a flower. He's given me. He's given this girl, I'm going to get you some ideas and we're going to have a good time. Yeah, there's no condoms in nursing homes. You know, we got 3000 reported case of committee among people. 40th five and older. Okay. But I'm 45 and older. That's normal. Forty five and older people are walking around meeting new people. Forty 3000. Seems like a very low number. Super low. That's what I'm saying. That's why I don't like these percentage numbers gonorrhea had see from doing this podcast all these years. I've. I understand when people can make things seem greater than they really are. Go back to that. Jamie, do you have your arp card? No, but someone set one to us to me and run to the comedy store, but I think that was some asshole thousand. Sounds low. Yeah. Primary and

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       secondary syphilis. Five thousand 650 cases were reported in this age group. 40th five. The thing about 45 and older is 45 year old people in 2019. It's not like 45 year old people in tHe sixties. Absolutely. These animals are out there fucking hitting the gym and doing squats and flying to Thailand. They're probably getting it from the sweat on the gym bench. They could get staff. I know a lady who almost died from staff from the gym. She ignored. She had some weird rash on her leg and no one told her that it was a staph infection and she. She went into shock and had fucking seizures from staff and she's 36, 37. She's fucking. She's my wife's friend. That's crazy. Dark shit. That dark dark staff from a gym. That's why I don't go to the gym. That's what I tell everybody. no staff.

Speaker 2:          01:26:57       You've got to get it. you go to go to the gym, dress like a superhero. You got work, tights going to call myself. Zero cards and fucking spray and all the. All the chemicals everywhere. Yeah. Like two guns to spray guns in each hand of alcoholic. She everything. No, I, I, I like the spray gun with alcohol, but it's one akila and one. So do some fucking chin ups. One of the mouse. Yeah. I've got staff twice from jujitsu. Oh yeah? Yeah, ringworm. Three times. At least staff twice and they'd be wearing once. It's rough ringworms. okay. But ringworms basically athlete's foot. Do you know the same? More or less? Yeah. You know, you piss on your feet to make athletes foot go away. Yes. Yeah. Girls go because girls can't aim with their pis. No, I can. I can help them grow this. Pat did just coming up with this gas monkey funnel.

Speaker 2:          01:28:01       Remember the fundal thing that, that they came up with the sheet. No. Yeah, there is a thing that girls can use. They stuff in their crotch that they can pee standing up. I just think that's probably not very sanitary. Well you're in is not really unsanitary. It's not really that bad. It's not a dangerous thing. Poking golden shoWer. Maybe they haven't, but I wouldn't be scared of it. Not scared to piss. They'd go. ms dot rogan. This is don't pay till he gets home. This is the thing about a jujitsu. You're so used to dude's sweating on you. Like, cause you're always looked. Yeah. I wouldn't like sweating like there was one time, just one time that I was. I was rolling with a friend of mine and he got on top of me, mounted me, and he was sweating in my fucking face, like his chest sweat was dripping in my face and we were laughing about it.

Speaker 2:          01:28:50       I was like, dude, what the fuck? You're sweating in my mouth. Basically. This is starting to get weird. Well, it's just part of like learning how to kill people, deal with the of training for Texas. We just use guns. No, that's not true. There's a lot of jujitsu schools in tech. I'm looking at the stats on the std thing for older people, and this is an article I found said only five percent of adults are using medicare to take the std tests, so it could be way higher if you're just not getting tested. It's way high. They're like, suck it up. I was in Vietnam. Come on. It's just a rash. Yeah, I mean the thing is like who's trying to stop these people? Who stopped those people, they're going to die. Let them, let them drop them. I'd be going in there and passing out all kinds of lube and toys and get after it math.

Speaker 2:          01:29:40       No, I wouldn't do that. Why not try it? If you're going to try matthew, try when you're 90. Yeah. That's an easy way out. Well, it's not even a way out. It's just a way forward. We gave uh, these, uh, ladies and my family, uh, weed for the first time when they turn 18 years old. they've never done anything, so we give them some brownies. Wow. And uh, we told don't, don't eat all the brownies at once, just eat a little bits, wait an hour or so. Yeah. You feel blah blah. They're like, well, we're trying it. We don't feel anything. We don't feel anything. We don't feel anything. Next thing you know, it's like only an hour later and they've made the whole pan. Now they think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread. Like, just bring brownies, thanksgiving dinner. Just bring brownies, just bring brownies. and they just like melt with the universe.

Speaker 2:          01:30:29       We just tricky in Texas though, right? Yeah. It's not legal yet. It's going to be. I'm in California though. It's right here. I got that elan musk trouble. We'd. What Is that? This is a, this is what's called a, a blunt. It's a tobacco on the outside and um, marijuana on the inside and nurtured the car. Shit dropped tesla stock six percent one day. Oh my, uh, my manager and pr person out there. I just literally shitting their pants right now. But it's legal. Well, it's legal here, right? There you go. I believe in the law. It's 100 percent legal. Here it is. A hundred percent. Who's the dude that I'm. Oh, Mike Tyson just brought you some of his weed. Is that how it comes? This is the box of death and life right here. Well, mike tyson's box of death in life. Yeah. Look, this is how hard Mike Tyson roles look at the sides of these fucking joints he gave me. I know the camera's not gonna be able to follow me, but I'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen, look at this shit.

Speaker 2:          01:31:45       Look at the fucking size. Oh, that's just insane. That's you, bro. I can't take that. I can't take it with you on the plane. How do I get on the plane? Then you just think thinking you'll appear in seat four c. That's the key. I would recommend any meaning more than enough for me. Alright, jamie, we'll take one more. Yeah, he gave me these joints that would make you think about people you fingered in highschool and want to find them on facebook and apologize. Just what is that? That's a goddamn cigar of marijuana. That's outrageous. That's tyson has a whole ranch. He has a hole put in this new one.

Speaker 2:          01:32:34       He has this uh, uh, tyson ranch. These growing marijuana and he's going to have like a resort desta destination or he's going to have like fitness classes, like tip toe through the tulips. Exactly who this you'll live. He's um, he's got a place down in palm beach. Where was it? PAlm springs, palm springs, palm springs, palm beach in Florida, palm springs, California out in the desert. They're developing this enormous property where they're going to grow weed and they're also going to have this huge place where people can go and have this resort, like a weed amusement park. Literally, they're going to have concerts there, like coachella type events, what do they call it, the kush fest or some shit fucking around the people. People behind it have deep pockets and they're going hard because what people have seen in Colorado and people are starting to see in Washington state and now in California, there's just an enormous amount of money involved in marijuana, like crazy, ridiculous, silly profit.

Speaker 2:          01:33:36       If you're doing it and you're taxing it and you're doing it responsibly. The way I look at it, it's no different than going to the store to buy beer. It's all combined too much beer and do something stupid. We've had four shots in an hour on a radio show. I have a driver driver. That's good. That's the way to do it responsibly. That's right. I mean, owning, owning a tequila company in, in, uh, in bars and restaurants. You kind of have to. Yeah. It takes the fun out of it because I'm a driver. I'm a car guy. Everything else. But yeah, but be responsible. Always be responsible. And the, you know, the thing is also if you are a person who likes fun, like what are you trying to stop fun? Like if someone's To smoke a little weed, have a little tequila, drink a couple of beers.

Speaker 2:          01:34:20       You should. Is that unless people are being responsible. Yeah. I don't see a drastic difference between the alcohol or marijuana. As long as you're obeying the laws being responsible for paying your taxes. Yes. I 100 percent agree. I also talk about it this way. Imagine if all the people in the world, but you, me and jamie and if jamie had decided that he. He thought that we were criminals and we're not allowed to drink alcohol anymore. Jamie's getting installed prohibition in our small community. He'll be ridiculous. We would be like, fuck you man. Well that's literally like the government telling you you can't do mushrooms. Are the government telling you you can't smoke weed? Like it's just a grown man telling other grown men they can. Based on what? It's not based on what we voted on. Like if people really knew the information involved in the safety of marijuana, does it freak you out?

Speaker 2:          01:35:12       Yeah, of course it does because it makes you paranoid 100 percent. But does alcohol make you an asshole? Fuck yes it does. Oh Yeah, but do I think that everybody should have all of it? Cbs rejects superbowl that based on the benefits of medical marijuana. Well, In their defense there's probably a bunch of people or stockholders and there's a lot of decisions that are made that are made by lawyers. I just want it just before people get angry about something that cbs decided to do. You have to understand the cbs is responsible for the employment of untold thousands of human beings. They're going to have bud light ads right next to this. They will or whatever they will. They will, but bud light, bud light ads are not going to affect anyone's bottom line. I dOn't agree. I don't agree, but I just want people to understand that.

Speaker 2:          01:36:00       Part of the problem is that the business aspect of this has not been fully established. Once it's fully established, cbs and all these people are going to realize it isn't any different than bud light. It's not any different than anything you can get fucked up on bud light if you just drink 20 of them, you can get fucked up. You could walk inTo trees, you do it on, you know, cough medicine or what else? Oh, that stuff's out there. anything. I mean, how many pharmaceutical drugs can you get fucked up on and do we deny that some people love, like serious injuries benefit greatly from pain pills? No, they definitely do. The thing about it at all, all is you got to be honest and let people form their own opinions. and part of being honest about it, about these things is tell them the pros and the cons.

Speaker 2:          01:36:42       Everything has a pro and a con including whole people banging it out and nursing home. Exactly. Getting committee, uh, you know, that's not good. The, the, the pro and the con is my dad's a pro banging old ladies in nursing home, but the con is he's probably got some stuff on his little winter down there, probably passing some biological footballs, but he's not getting pregnant. Yeah, he's not getting pregnant. No one's getting pregnant and listen folks, people get colds. TheY get the flu. all sorts of weird things happen when people corral around are the people. What are we supposed to live like john travolta and the boy in the plastic bubble and fucking lock ourselves in hermetically sealed chambers and never touch each other again. Get the fuck out of this true. Just take your penicillin back it off, but that's what napoleon did. Walk up.

Speaker 2:          01:37:29       Gladys, I think you might've given him a thing or two. Just hit the massengill. You'll be good. I wonder. I wonder who's delivering these venereal diseases. It's like, that would be fascinating if we found it was primarily women. It was like 78 percent of women are the original source of the venereal disease. Well, they pulled the apple down, right? I don't believe that happened. I think there was a bitch ass man who blamed it on the chick when I heard that adam and eve story. I was like, yeah, right. Maybe adam was a bitch. She blamed it on eve and he wrote, he was the guy who could write. So he wrote things down. He was like either drop a and do shit. I'm a good listener. He probably ate the apple first. I probably gave it to eve. You know, history is written by the winners.

Speaker 2:          01:38:19       This is correct. And a lot of women just to let that shit go. Let them talk. Yeah. Right down the night that I will fuck you. And he's like, fuck you. And adam and eve, I don't see adam and eve having that New York accent where they get it in New York. Wasn't there yet. I feel like adam and eve would talk like british people because anytime they have a movie where people talk like old timey, whether it's gladiator, whatever. Everyone talks with an english accent. Do you ever notice that? If we have to, right? If we have to, uh, there's like the suspension of disbelief. Like we don't know, latin and latin, who the fuck knows? That sounded like. Right. So when, when you watching some old ass movie about people talking lot and they'll speak english, but they'll speak it with an english accent. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:39:05       That only speak proper. They always have some weird old timey movie. What's ever watched the movie otherwise? Right. But you. Right. But why is that? Because it's got to make it watchable. That's why they ruined stories. What t two english people is that played out like eleanor's are played out to him. Do you know what I'm saying? Absolutely. Like to english people, they hear that accent every day. That's a normal accent. But to us it's like, oh, this is like an old timey language. Hangul. Why is russell crowe talking like he's from fucking london? This is bullshit. Yeah. I got a friend of mine, a big chris, and he likes to say, well we invented the english language and I'm like, yeah, and he fucked it up. Yeah, you guys made it so that people don't understand it. That's stupid. That's not smart. We've made it better.

Speaker 2:          01:39:50       We really did. I just say that my rebuttal to him was like, oh yeah, well somebody from your town still trying to be a rapper in their defense though, they will always say to you like, yeah, but listen, you guys respect our language more than you respect yours. And it's true. Like american english is not as respectable as english english because that's why they use those english people to sell like late night mops and shit. Right. Call me dude. They fucking nonstick frying pans. It's always some man with a proper accent. You look at this, I can just find these eggs and they slide right onto the plate. Believable. Throw back a nickels in there and scratch it up. Nope, not a scratch. If that was a guy from jersey that was selling you that you'd be like, look at this asshole trying to lie to me about his bullshit frying pan right.

Speaker 2:          01:40:38       And his fucking shitty mop. But something about like english accents get us foR sure. They have a better. They have a more respectable version of our language, but our sounds better. You could say it easier. I understand it. They understand us. We don't always understand them. That was lIterally just on a phone call with a, uh, a lady in europe before I got in here and I couldn't understand a word she was saying. The thing is though, here's where I'm wrong, here's where I'm wrong. They understand each other. They fucking, they'll start. I was in belfast, northern Ireland, which is mind will be in the cantina scene in star wars. These motherfuckers, they barely speak english. They speak english for sure. They understand each other a 100 percent. But to me, I was talking to this guy and he was drunk out of his fucking mind.

Speaker 2:          01:41:28       We were drinking dark beer. just me and this dude, this is like early 2003, early ufc, ufc in dublin. I all, I remember this guy saying how to fight any man. He was hammered. How tiny man, I'm telling you, your child and your fucking. Show them how. Show them right now. He says to him, he was making perfect sense. All I caught was I'll fight any man. This motherfucker might've said that a hundred times and just kept buying drinks. Hammered with me. And some dude from belfast, we will. You understood lIke 20 percent of what each other was saying. You got to use the translate thing on your phone. WoulDn't work. I'd fight anyone. Oh, what is this color?

Speaker 4:          01:42:09       This guy? You're saying, whoa, you skipped to kill. This guy is simply going to fight me to the hospital. You'd be puttIng off to the side if he like, it ain't finished. But if you're promoting,

Speaker 2:          01:42:24       pause it. Now. Imagine being hammered. Post ufc event, trying to mingle with the locals were drinking dark beer and whiskey. There's maybe 30 people around me that are yelling like that and I'm talking to this dude. So all the people around me, who are you drunk? No one knew. No one knew what anybody next to him was saying. Everybody's loud and hammered and this guy is fucked up. And he's telling me this. How did. Hi, my name's john. And I'm like, okay, you go fight him. That's so funny. We've. We've put up this video before that exact guy video a long time ago. He. What is this one was really old. You talking about this? Me telling me about this guy right here, eight years ago or some shit. What is that from right at the same time from an old. There's two things going on in the background. Did you hear it?

Speaker 2:          01:43:24       Damn, I had a beard back then. That's the same guy. That's hilarious. Now that's like pikey language, right? Yeah. I guess. I mean it says you. The first video I pulled up the study was from. I think I typed in belfast or something, but here's the thIng, here's where I'm wrong. They fucking understand each other 100 percent. They understand every word they say so wrong. I just. I'm just not in that environment. What do you hang out and you'll get it. It's got a flavor though. They have a flavor that we don't have, right? It's a dark old world flavor. Hey listen mate, that's fucking dude who just came over on a boat and shooting arrows at people. They kept that same language and they're always looking to fIght out of fucking fight homeready. Oh, I'm sure you get a bunch of that shit. I'm a pretty friendly guy, so most, most of that stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:44:14       I don't get the guys that I get are people that want to be like professional fighters and then want to just talk about it a little bit and they're always very friendly. You'd be amazed like people that aspire to be professional fighters are some of the nicest fucking human beings you're ever gonna run across because they've. They've figured out their own ego through competition to the point where they're not really. They're not. They're not worried about like putting out an image. They know who they are. Correct, and they were like real friendly, like some of the nicest people that have ever met ever a professional fighters. That's a weird thing for people to hear, but I think that for men there's something about trial through combat and just just be just being understanding like what, what it's like to overcome, like an insurmountable obstacles for the average person just makes them calmer. There's a different kind of human. The more chill

Speaker 3:          01:45:03       they are. My or not my hairdresser for 15 years been cutting my hair. He probably don't have this problem I'm used to. It was a real struggle. He's a, he's a bald head and he's a fighter and you trust them. I wouldn't take my and he's a fighter and he's going to give me a z. Some muscles is shit like hacking away with my head. I'm like, this is not really trustworthy at all. Yeah, there was a video out there.

Speaker 2:          01:45:35       Someone showed me. Was it you? Did you show me jamie? Some of the, the, the uh, I didn't even ask me what it was for us. The drunk we are, um, someone took a phone,

Speaker 3:          01:45:45       we had a sound like a hair cutter and it, and they run It by people's heads. I never run away and people freak out on them. Oh, there's nothing wrong with that. They've run it up the back of a girl's head. It's a good practical joke. I mean, it'd be way better with a real razor. So main would be. But that's a, that's a big deal for people can be cutting off their hair. So yeah, I've always wanted to shave my head at least once in life and I never just get a crew cut. You're a beautiful man. Thank you. Perfect. Shaved head, you've got a nice thick head of hair. Yeah. No, but, uh, now know contracts with crap. They tell you what, whoa, whoa, whoa. Got to keep the same style man. Continuity really? Which I kind of called continuity because it's like, do these people really believe I just did this in an hour or was it over the course of a few days?

Speaker 3:          01:46:29       Okay. Well I'll just tell him. I'm like, what do y'all think as, as, as producers and networks and whatever, how, how bad the I think the american public is. I mean, how unintelligent that You have to do a scene where I just walked in your door and sat down here and put on my headphones and then they flipped me over somewhere going, you asshole. I walked in the door and put on my headphones. I mean, it's so insane and it's like, it's like the recipe. It's like you have to tell them everything you do and then I set up for the shot and I have to walk out the door. They're like, well, the audience won't know where you came from. it's my fucking shop. I'm here. What do you mean they won't have any idea? That would be so confused. It's insane and I've tried so hard to change the recipe a little bit.

Speaker 3:          01:47:14       I understand you have to do certain things, but why do you have to tell the audience what they just saw? Period. You're noT stupid. You. If you make them stupid, you can make them stupid. You'd never challenge him ever. I think that as a society we might be on our way to that. What? What was that show? Idiotic. Because I argued all the time. I love my show and I love what we do, but I'm like, why do I got to come out of the door, put my headphones on and then go. So I got there and I put my headphones on. It was unbelievable, especially after I came through the door, so fucking stupid, but they've always done it that way and I think of it at the same way. I think about cbs and their medical marijuana ads. There's like a bunch of people that are just trying to protect jobs.

Speaker 3:          01:47:58       They're just like, we're going to make it easier, easier for people to know. You can't have anything left to chance. The, the kinda filled her numbers where they had such a bad thing that they can't show that commercial, but at the same time we're selling boxes that say this will kill you. Yeah, exactly. And people are buying them. Why do you think they still break up shows with commercials? Wouldn't it be more effective if they didn't do that? It's just a monetization problem, I'm sure, but I think you could get a little more bang for your buck by having this episode bias. So instead of a 100 percent, not only that, I think they, instead of having like two or three ads every five minutes or whatever they make it do. How about you just have a couple of product placements? Correct. Show and have them cost more.

Speaker 3:          01:48:44       Exactly what you put in the. Then you got to put it into the recipe. So some guy like us, it's car guys that are watching the show and I'm like, holy shit. He just bought that porsche and then it goes commercial and it's like I'm getting a beer and I'm going to sit back down on the couch and in the next five minutes has been going. So I went to la and I bought a porsche. You already wasted that guy's tie. Exactly. Exactly. And the only reason we have to do It, because you imagine that people are coming in from these breaks, it just jumping in the middle of it and might, they might be doing that. How about make them figure it out, figure it out, bitch. Well, figuring out what they need to get rid of the nielsen whole bullshit. I mean, does that real? They're still counting cable boxes. Are they even counting cable boxes and not doing anything? You have a nielsen box, right? So it's not even like cable box. There's only like a few thousand or whatever. And then they decide what the rating is and it's like, are you kidding me? Because I'll see you in my ratings. And I'm like, I know it was more than that on the energy company, you know? So, uh, I own a social media company. I'm like, oh, we had way more than

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       that. I wonder how they do really know and whether they just accept the fact that even if they don't know the real numbers, at least they have a reliable percentage that everyone can agree on. The problem that everyone agrees on it, they'll, they'll set their advertising rates based on that agreement more or less. But the real ideology of it is we have the access because all these devices and everything else to have the real number, right? Like the real, real number. But everyone will have to give it up, right? Like verizon would have to give it up and then I'm going to give it to each other and they want to say, yeah, I think they just need to remap the program and so they can really see how many people there are. Because right now in the industry and people think the viewers are way down and I actually tend to disagree.

Speaker 2:          01:50:34       I think they're up just the way that we count them or bad debt. It's definitely not good because I've never been counted fucking filled out a nielsen thing. I've never used the nielsen box. I don't know anybody who has I need to do. I, you know, I met with. I met one boy. You'd once said that his brother was like, can you find a picture of the nielsen box? Just like you know that directv has some numbers, right? They must have some digitaL. Hell yeah. They got numbers down to the way. Why wouldn't they know? Even if they're not using it as some sort of a rating system that affects the ratings of a television show, you would think that they would want to know how effective their product is. If you can measure that, why wouldn't you measure that and they've just never changed it. They really do need to though. It'd be way cool if they did. It would be weird. Be weird if you find out what everybody was watching. What if like keeping up with the kardashians, like a billion people in episode.

Speaker 2:          01:51:32       most of the world is going, what the fuck? Yeah, exactly. Actually the world is still. It looks at and goes, what the fuck? Yeah. But what if most of the world, what if you know what? What do you think is like the biggest disparity has gotta be it's gotta be satellite and cable. Right? Because they don't. They're not aLlowed to measure those. The mobile phone thing, like mobile phones or they say netflix specials, like comedy specials. they said 40 something percent of people. Plus watch them on their phones. Yeah, I mean I've started to watch everything on my ipad and my phone. I don't really watch tv anymore. I watched the ufc on my phone on espn plus I was like, wow, this is crazy. I'm watching live fights on my phone with a regular connection. Not, not wifi. This is a weird time. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:52:22       I remember when we were younger, we spent thousands of dollars for the giant tv. When the box it had the projectors. Well, the thing about the phone is this kind of selfish. It's like personal, like if you're watching a movie on your phone, it's just you watching that movie. Yeah. You're not going to get. You can't like sit next to your wife and watch a movie on your phone. No one's going to deal with that. Even if you're on a plane, that would suck. Exactly. but watching a fight on the phone is like, it's way less interesting than watching it on the big screen, but you can take it everywhere, so eventually they're going to get that into some large thing like a hologram or some shit. That's what I. Or ar augmented reality. It's not going to be too much longer before they're doing all the ai and augmented reality I think is really what's.

Speaker 2:          01:53:08       What's interesting to me. Wait, netflix doing something with that right now with that one show they have out or you can pick the different endings. Oh yeah, yeah. The black mirror show. Yeah. Yeah. We go back to that article again. What was the kind of new articles saying that. An example of one I was going to say like that. So the tvs are there, have been known to. They would screen. They watch what's on your screen and send that data back to a database based off of like everything that's currently live on tv. It's the same thing happens with audio streams and shizam or like there's a couple of different companies that do that. So they sell your data? Yeah. Then so that they'll sell that back to advertisers sort of like the same way. What's happening with some of these apps. That's how that.

Speaker 2:          01:53:52       That's how people found out that companies are tracking you because there's third party companies that are selling that data once they have it because they don't, they don't need it for everything. See the person with the problem with this kind of shit with people is that that's not what the agreement was. The agreement wasn't that you tell people that I'm watching the agreement was I buy a tv from you. That was the agreement. Like when You say, oh, we're going to sell the data from the people that are watching your tv, you're like, okay, well yeah, but the cables that guarantee it's buried in your cable deal. Yeah, the south. We get to keep it prop south park. Have a bid oN that, that whole human setup pad, they once you, the terms of service, like no one's reading it, but you're agreeing to becoming seen that episode because could becoming a fucking thing. So what, how's it going? I'm sorry. Like just just agreeing to the terms of service, like you don't know what you're doing. And like the joke on that was that your agreement to become a human centipede.

Speaker 2:          01:54:43       I never saw a human centipede either to a couple bars I've seen. Yeah. Um, they're going to get us in weird ways, but they're just trying to find out who's watching what. The thing is like, should your tv be able to just watch. You should be able To have a line on what you're watching. Because I know people now that just use netflix and they don't have anything. They didn't have an internet connection is hooked up to their television. Television connects to netflix automatically. It's like one of the native apps. Yeah. But if you're connected to the internet, you're getting watched. You know, is what most people would say. I, I'm so paranoid about it. I have a little piece of duct tape over my camera on my ipad. Good move. Yeah, good move. I don't need that on there, but the thing is it's like.

Speaker 2:          01:55:29       Yeah, but why are you selling data? Wants to buy it. Yeah, but why are you allowed to just collect data from people? It's pretty much in the contract you sign. I get shit. Literally there should be two prices. This should be one where you're allowed to collect data. You can collect data for me, but it costs like 50 bucks more a year. And the other one where you know, I, you can't collect my data, I have to pay a little bit more money. That's, that's kind of happening. There are apps you can use that'll track how many, how much are walking in exchange for letting them, letting you turn on that. They'll give you stuff out, like whatever. If it's useful to you. I don't.

Speaker 1:          01:56:11       What are you talking about? Like if you walked by mcdonald's, they can serve you, but mcdonald's ad

Speaker 2:          01:56:16       for sure for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's the ultimate goal, right? Is to figure out where you are and target you with something. Yeah. Yeah. So my friend animal green tree was on here and we were talking about he lives in Australia and he lives. He goes, he travels like deep into the outback where it takes us three days to drive in and I said, everybody has toyota trucks because those fucking things never break. They don't. They don't. And so he gets ads all of a sudden out of nowhere on his phone. Every time he goes to a website that says toyota trucks, he's like, what the fuck? He goes, I didn't google it. It was a cook cookies. Well, it's kinda called cookies, but it's not something that came from a search. It's something that came from something in his phone is listening. We said the word toyota trucks it, registered it and added it to his queue of is google. So many messages. Were they listening? So many messages from people that brought. We brought this up the other day. I go to these signs and messages like you guys mentioned, do they think it's real estate x? And they started getting served ads for that. Like I said, I Just said columbia,

Speaker 5:          01:57:18       I don't know, penicillin. he tried to buy stock.

Speaker 2:          01:57:26       It's like he's got so much chlamydia, we're going to sell him all the benefits that it would be smart to. My assistant just said, just bought a stock

Speaker 5:          01:57:37       screener.com. We actuallY own gas actually screener.com. Now

Speaker 2:          01:57:49       we'll get. That's a border. The border wall is a fucking tough question because it is a certain amount of people just going to be mad at you. You fucking cooks which go over there and soak all those marks can dirks aBout that. Some people are going to get, they're going to get there, they're going to get angry. I

Speaker 1:          01:58:02       might go down and chasing a latina ladies for sure. It's a, you know, such a hot, hot topic. But that's also, you know, few open yourself up to comments. Well somebody brought one up the other day that was a general discussion question and it said, you know, why don't we just do dna? Let's say your board, we take your fingerprints, we take everything else, we check you all out. Why don't we just do the dna and I get the privacy part of it for later on, but at the same time you're solving a lot of problems with the very beginning. Okay, this person just came out of here and they've done nothing. Right? So now if they ever do anything we know to go shoot him in the back of the, well, we certainly

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       could do that, but we would have to place a gigantic priority on getting the very best people in law enforcement. You would have to eliminate all shitheads. You'd have to pay those cops way more and treat them with the respect that they deserve as people that literally are protecting you from violent criminals. I was what I know mean I'm a huge supporter of cops. I've. I've been around cops most of my life because of martial arts. I know a lot of cops, and this is a weird issue with people where they fuck the police. Know if you're saying fuck the police, you might as well say, fuck the humans. If someone does something bad, if someone does something bad to someone, we don't say, fuck all humans. If someone murdered someone, we say, fuck that guy, and then you start breaking it down to whatever group you're not a part of, so it's fuck that x generation guy, fuck that lebanese guy or whatever nationality he is, fuck that straight guy. Or if, uh, if he's gay and he killed somebody, fuck that gay guy. But it's just humans. we're all individuals no matter what it is, no matter what we're talking about. And as soon as you start breaking down into groups like, oh, fuck these people, you can't do that with everybody. Then just because what's that? Then it just becomes a fight. Everybody's touching. It's, you can't do that. You can't do that. We're all fucking in this thing together. Correct.

Speaker 5:          02:00:11       God damn, we're drunk, right? Probably too drunk or not drunk yet.

Speaker 3:          02:00:18       You'll have one here that we had all I needed, so I'm probably going to be in trouble for that. Did they give you a hard time about that? Who knows if it's legal in California where I'm at. So it's legal. Exactly. You know how many people used to go down to Mexico to watch or whatever or do whatever. I'm amazed that people are still bringing in weed from Mexico. That shows me have a real lack of american engine nudity. That's outrageous. Well, the canadians are the ones that are now [inaudible] dot com currently or where you redirect you to this spot.

Speaker 5:          02:00:53       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:01:00       Oh, that is so stupid. The internet is undefeated. I gotta give a shout out to my people. They said that. That's amazing. If people did that that quickly. You got some rocks off automatically directed to cut screener. I hope discovery channel doesn't get hit with a wave of protests. Which mou on discovery? Yeah. It just discovered they have a giant network though, right? Like they have like how many different channels or on the discovery network channels I think is like 80 or 90 years. That's crazy. It might be more than that. That's crazy. I mean they have some channels that I've never even heard of like you know the brick wall channel or I have idea. It's just insane stuff. They divided all down. I think there needs to be a little consolidation in the market. Yeah. Well, you know, it's everybody loved top gear, right?

Speaker 3:          02:01:50       Like top gear is probably like one of the greatest car shows of all time. I never really watched it. How dare you. I'm telling you, how dare you. Richard rawlings, but it's a. Is it dead now or is it still there? The grant. What is the grand tour or something like that. Something like on amazon. Amazon picked it up. I haven't watched a single episode of the new one, but the old one was shit and part of it that was fun was that, you know, those guys were kind of nuts. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That's what we do. You know, gas monkey. We cut them loose. We'd have fun. We'd light stuff on fire, break it, whatever. yeah. And there was some violence. What's the uh, what's his name? The head guy? Uh, clarkson. Was it jeremy clarkson got into some producer, right? Oh, trust me.

Speaker 3:          02:02:37       Yeah. I don't know if that producer deserved it or not. Had to reserve myself quite a few times. People get crazy. You know, you're putting a show together. It's especially, you know, those guys, the producers, the camera guys, the sound guys, the people that are sitting in the discovery offices and they have jobs. This is my life I'm putting on every single day, you know, and so not only do I have my whole life on it and in it, but then I had to deal with filming it and I've tried to explain it to them because they don't care to a point if the show does well or bad because there'll be another richard on the road. But yeah, there's a lot of high volume approach when it comes to those kind of like a cable shows, you know, they just try to bang out as many as they can. High voLume, you know, and they have a formula that they try to file when they have a lot of like set up scenarios where people get in trouble for things where they're not really getting in trouble.

Speaker 3:          02:03:33       So it's all set up in advance, you know, it's almost scripted, right? A lot of reality shows. Some of them can be. You just know that just poured the fifth shot. How dare you, or is it fit? I think it was the fifth, but um, I think it's that they, um, I was telling myself this morning I should cut back on drinking. I tell myself that every morning, but it's so wild because I've known as the guy that likes to drink some cold miller lites and hang out in the garage. So even, you know, my own bars and restaurants and stuff and they'll come in, they're like, I'm buying you a beer. And I'm like, sir, you really don't have to. I own the place. Oh, I'm buying it. I'm like, you really don't have to. They're like, nope. Buying it. Like ringing up sally. Well, it makes people feel good. People like buying people's shit like that. That's a beautiful thing about booze. People like buying people that drink. Let me buy you a drink. All right. It's like a niCe gesture. ExactlY. Don't bite people's sandwiches, right? They buy people drinks. Oh, I'm down for pizza sandwich. Anything. Anytime I'm going to buy you an herbal tea. No one's

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       ever said that. Yeah, no. Well, we're in California, I'm sure they're saying it right now. You'd probably say, would you like macho or just the regular herbs or like people probably said that just try to appear spiritual. I'd like to buy you an herbal tea juice you with bitcoin and herbal tea. I had a girl asked me the other day. She goes, you're laura seems different. Interesting, interesting. Uh, I'm like, I don't get that lady that all. She goes, well, I see you every year here. Barrett, jackson, and you just, your, your, your glow is different clothes different. I'm like, well, I'm still using the same tom ford axe body spray thing. People have weird things. They say to people to fuck with them. Or you gaining weight? Gaining weight. Richard, your rs. Different. Yeah. You look so thin. Are you? Is your diet okay?

Speaker 2:          02:05:30       How's your diet? Okay, my diet's great. What's your or has different trying to figure out what's wrong. He not happy. Are you not happy? Oh, I'm perfectly abby. What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong with you? Fuck it up. They're hoping. They're hoping you're ready to crack. Fucking just juking you. Come on. I know you're scared exactly the trick and you tricky and revealing some shit here. Aras off, richard. Something's wrong with your aura. You should probably be able to punch people that say that we should definitely go, hey, fuck off or as aren't real bitch. You need to draw the aura. Show me what to watch. You get. You've got to have some science behind this. The whole ideology of fuck off is my thing. So the gas mcgee ring underneath says, fuck off. I'm shaking your hand and you should always be able to say fuck off if you can't say fuck off, but you have to be judicious, right?

Speaker 2:          02:06:30       You have to say fuck off when fuck off is appropriate, but you have to also salute people when they're not full of shit. Yeah, yeah. You say you're definitely not the person I'm telling to fuck off. You're a. You're a good dude. You're all right, man. You got to have positive and negative. Like someone is telling you they're reading. They're all your auras. Okay. You might be able to. I mean, I don't know what the fuck you're seeing. I barely know what I'm saying. I have no idea of what I'm seeing is really even remotely similar to what you're seeing. I'm just assuming. There you go. It's just a guess like, like some people like weird fucking cars, right? Like some people are really into certain cars. You go, I don't get it. Yeah. Like a pinto hatchback or something. Some people are really into.

Speaker 2:          02:07:12       Those are popular with some groups. Some people are really into like gross look and shit. Yeah. I don't know what they're seeing. Maybe they're seeing something different than me. Well, it's probably a combination of their childhood, their upbringing, what have you, but isn't like. Is it possible that like personal taste is a lot like sprinting speed. Like not everybody is going to be Carl Lewis, right? Not everybody is going to be some who's another fast guy who's st bull. Hussein bolt is the fastest ever supposed to be. Yeah, he's the fastest. However, not everybody could do that. So isn't it possible that that would also apply to taste? That there's, there's people out there that really get what's wrong with your fucking shitty taste and there's other people out there that likes fox body. Mustang. Fox body I think is the best looking carval's it's the best ever. I just left barrett jackson and when you see something real across the stage and you're just like, why in the hell is somebody that I don't get it and they're over. They're clapping and they're all happy ordering drinks for their friends. Look, I just bought an 81, a thunderbird turbo mustang. Five point. Oh, like vanilla ice had in this video.

Speaker 2:          02:08:29       We're going into dangerous waters there. Mad my buddy sold when it barrett last year. High scar. It's not the worst car in the world, but if you had to compare, what is that like 87, 88. Like what was that car? What year was that? [inaudible] 89. 80 nine mustang. Five point maybe it was 87. He's. He had to drop top down so his locks can flow. Didn't he? Something like that. You know, he grew up just up the street from where I grew up. I met him at a ufc, I believe. I believe he was very nice. There it is. Bam. My uh, my friend kevin, jason had one of those but he didn't have a convertible rolling in dough. We were like fucking 20 years old. That car back in the day was the shit. If you had one of those cars, you are a fucking hero.

Speaker 2:          02:09:21       It was fast. It was, it was also like it was a, the car to have 230 horsepower and it really, I know, I wonder, it might not have had any more, but it was good because we were all stupid and we didn't know how to drive anyway. But those cars were that at that time for whatever reason, like what, whatever was wrong with people. That was a good looking car. But if you look at that car could pick like a 69 mach one, like get the fuck outta here. How did you do this? Go to a 69. Mach one black 1969. Mach one. Absolutely best car ever. It's one of them. I mean, there's some arguments out there of one of the, but it's in fucking race for sure. It's in the top three to five black, 69. Mach one mach piece of shit. I had a real and it's true. It's true. That is rest of my. But this shape is an order. That's good. That's good. That is the one down there at the big picture. Oh, is it a 78 year old. Got to have your headlights on the 16th. That's right. This is the missing sidelights.

Speaker 2:          02:10:28       Seventy one. Mach one was what? Keanu reeves had he wished he had a chevelle. Didn't he know he had a chevelle after they stole his fucking mustang? Dude, they did the ultimatum. Okay. They killed his dog and they stole his mustang. Very. You go, you got to go kill. This. Began to kill some russians. I actually did some promo for that show was pretty good. That fucking movie. Here's what's there it is. There's the john wick mustang. There it is. The guy was talking to him and rust in russian about as much. Fuck, that's a good car. This show is great because the kid was just a total fuck up. What do I do with this? Yeah. Do I kill my kid or kill this dude? And then he came with what I said we were talking about your shovel. You're 68 chevelle. I go between 68, 69 and those 1970.

Speaker 2:          02:11:18       Sometimes I look at those 70 zero. God damn, that's the perfect car. They look a little tougher. IT's a mad man's car. Look at that one. Woo. I need one. Look at that god damn thing that mock one. 60 nine. We're going to build one on the show. Hopefully this year. That's a fuck a beautiful car. Yeah. Sixty nine. Mach one. And the boss for 29 to get Into buildings over these movie cars because I've seen some of them up close and they're their shit. Go to classic recreation's boss for 29. Go to this. You need to see this. Uh, he, he made this murdered out 1969 boss. And it's. Look at that day. How dare you. Now. That's perfect. That's perfect. Christ. And get that goddamn car ever ruins that right now. Give me a call. I'm like, holy shit. That's pretty awesome. That's about as ameriCa as an eagle killing a terrorist. Exactly right.

Speaker 2:          02:12:22       Look at that fucking car, man. Don't go away from that picture. Jamie. Go back to that picture. Good lord. Might be pretty good. There's not a better looking car. There's just different. Nothing's better looking than that doesn't exist. I don't give a fuck what anYbody says. There's nothing better looking than that car. There's just different. I agree. We've had a few balls for $29 through the shot, but that was not a modern one like that. There's a rat gang of evil cars from that day, but there's not a better looking one. I mean the, the, the manufacturers, we're just trying to one up each other. I mean just kind of just the wild west of automobile and like I'm going to reach out to you now. I'll tell you, and I wish you know, we're sort of in that again right now. Yeah. Right now dodge chevy and a ford are kind of doing the same thing right now.

Speaker 2:          02:13:12       They are, and it's also elevated everybody's interior game, which keep that up there. Don't you take that down. That's like shutting down porn. What's wrong with everybody's interior game stepped up to because it used to be like the germans. The japanese had much higher build quality with the interiors, but corvette has had to step up. Its considerably. The new corvettes are very nice interior. Tony hinchcliffe has one standup comedian, extraordinary tony hinchcliffe. He's got a grand sport, whiCh a lot of people think is the best of the because it's not too overpowered. Still got the wide body, but I look at the interior go. This is a nice interior men. It's not like it used to be. It used to be the car as fast as fuck. It's put the seat and there's nothing in it. You have a two spoke steering wheel that when you can actually bend it, you know, those, those cars were terrible. I just noticed her, these fake clouds in the air. Yeah. What they are is these lights that used to have clear covers. Instead, we got this thing from octo lights and they're a company that makes, uh, it's, it's like a photograph of clouds that you could see through. So we put it over the top of the light itself. Did octo mom start that until lights? No. Gotcha.

Speaker 3:          02:14:30       Because there's only six lights in here. Not a well in the old place we had them. They were stars, but the news place, the lights, these led lights are just not as bright so we had to change it to clouds, but it looks at the new roles with the star. I've got A wraith, um, and it's got the shooting star every once in awhile. And really? Yeah. So a lot of people don't know that the star pattern that they put in the headliner in the car is the exact star pattern from, I guess the original factory or whatever. Oh wow. And uh, it, uh, what have you, but a unbelievable. You're riding along. You got stars above you. It's freaking rad. Yeah. My neighbor has one of those. That car is epic. It's a two door, four door knock at the door and get in it.

Speaker 3:          02:15:17       And you go with this car is preposterous. It's so quiet. It's like you're barely connected to the outside world. There you go. Those suicide doors. Look at the fucking ceiling. Men. You're barely connected to the world. Barely. YOu barely paid attention. No, I jump in there. And uh, my uh, poodle fifi jumps in and I got a standard Black poodle. This big, big girl, if she jumps in there and just like rods around looking at people. Did theY develop poodles for some specific hunting reason? So they were hunters. Yeah, like people think of poodles. They think of poodles is like a, like a rich person's to beverly hills dog. The ballet. I poodles brand as hunters. And what happened? A matter of fact, mine, uh, uh, I called her fifi as her name and she brought a rabbit in. One nighT she comes to bed, I'm laying there and I'm like, what is she messing with? So I reached down in the dark and pull up this rabbit. I'm like, what the frick and a. But they soft mouth, don't they? They, they're, it's in their genes. They don't kill them. They bring them to the master as a sign of respect, show respect, plus they don't

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       kill it. So she brought a live rabbit into my who's like a rabbit. Must've been having a tough day. Oh dude. But it went off. It went all freaking possum on you. It just laid there and I carried it down, put it down to the runaway. Actually about 10 minutes is what it took it to come out of frozen state. I mean it just got eight by poodle and brought into bed with me. It probably feels like as long as it's alive, just to go with this, just go limp and hope you're just a toy. Just hope it happens. Yeah. That's the good thing. She's got her own instagram. She's doing well. She's always showing off domestic dogs, right? Like they don't need to eat. They don't need to kill you to eat. So they're, they're only, they're only grabbing you. So rabbit's probably just keep it together and he'll eventually get bored.

Speaker 2:          02:17:15       Exactly. Has really want to eat you. What does that to a poodle? 16, 49. An engraving. Okay. How about in 16? 40 nine? They already fucked dogs up to that point because all dogs come from wolves. That's what one of the favorite read are. They one of the biggest. One of the weirdest stories that came out of a genetics is understanding that all dogs came from wolves. They didn't think that. I think I'm pretty sure they thought that all dogs. We're like a combination of a bunch of different things like wild dogs and different things that eventually became like a mass diff or something, but now they realize no, every single dog from a chihuahua to a great dane comes from a wolf. Yeah, but I mean there are some dogs that. What do you do with them? I meaN you've got 150 pound massive that just lays there and slobbers.

Speaker 2:          02:18:10       I had 140 pound master if he lived to be 13 years old. He was awesome. He's a greaT dog now. They're great dogs with this air and they're smart. TheY're smart and they're big and I don't like take. I don't. I don't mind. I mean, especially here in California, you got to pick up the dogs crap. But yeah, you don't want to pick up a crap that's bigger than mine. Texas. You find dog. She just shoot it. Now you got to pick it up. It's, it's, it's everywhere. There's people walking along and that just cracks me up. I'm like, I'm going to follow this giant animal around and pick up and shit. That's the least of your worries. The real problem is it doesn't understand how big it is. and it knocks people downstairs and you gotta be real careful. If you have steep stairs and a big dog, you have to really train that motherfucker correctly.

Speaker 2:          02:18:53       You have to let them know, hey, you can't jump on the four year old at the top stair you fucking dummy. But he's a dog. He's just loves you. They love you. Get a, you know, bIg dogs. Like my friend Johnny Cash was my dog. He's um, and uh, my friend joe sold it to me and he was a trainer of dogs for movies and shit. Like, you know, the movie, the incredible hulk with the one with eric bana when nick nolte, he plays his dad and nicole is the bad guy. And he's like a scientist and he sticks the hulk serum into these dogs and he turns these dogs, these big giant hoking mastiffs. While the original dog was actually my friend's dog and he was a trainer of these dogs and he brought them to fear failure and on fear factor. These doctors just laying around like super chill like that.

Speaker 2:          02:19:42       That's the cartoon dog. But there was lIke a real dog before that. His name the dog was, he's a regency massive and his name was curly. So anyway, this guy, he developed these. He raised these dogs and made them too. He bred them to this place where they just had no aggression, no aggression to dogs, no aggression to people like this dog was like a hulk, just a giant mass muscle. But you can come up to it. Anybody come up to him, pet it. Little kids were petting it and he was like gently kissing their face. He was the sweetheart of sweethearts. We run in here and look at one more. We got more people out there. I'm good. But anyway, he's a big dog. But he was a super sweetheart. It's all about like breeders know, like how they breed them. Yeah, for sure.

Speaker 2:          02:20:30       What kind of dogs do you have? Just a fifi. The poodle. Standard poodle. How much does fifi way? Probably 60. So reasonable shit. You're cleaning up a reasonable handful. I know several times a day. It's like if you have like an english mastiff. No, you got. You don't have the one bag, two bags a hunk of shit. Then you've got to figure out how to roll this one and roll with this and got a pot roast of shit that comes ouT of that animal's asshole every few hours. It's insane. Yeah. That's a poor. Fellows and gals don't live very long though, unfortunately. That's what's sad. Those really big dogs like eight, nine years. They're done. Mine lived to be 13, which was extraordinary. That's pretty old, but he was hurt and I had, I couldn't walk. I would have to carry him to his food and then carry him back outside.

Speaker 2:          02:21:24       So you can go to the bathroom. It was bad trials and tribulations of big dogs. They're just on the jra. Uh, you can tune in on a screener document, might be one of the greatest things that's ever happened in the history of this show. Is [inaudible] dot com trending yet? For sure. For sure. and people are going to be mad at us. Why didn't you have to use a derogatory term for months? China? Well, I call it a big deck screener. He's guys are dicks. They're assholes. Dixon assholes. And yet you chose con. Wait, we were thinking about manhole, but it's the same. But Australia has the proper use of the word cunt and too much reverence to that word in America. people get confused about it. And Australia, they just throw that bitch around like it's a beach ball concert. I've some australians on mY show. Yeah. It's like even, you know, I'm from Texas. I'm like, holy shit. He's saying that we're a lot of these fucking cunt. He's a good can't. That's my favorite. He's a good cat. He's a good cat. And they made that like, you might as well Be replacing the word cunt for dude because it's all about intent to them. It's basically saying, hey, he's a good dude. He's a good dude and there's not as good con. There you go. It's not bad.

Speaker 2:          02:22:48       Got to have a set of these. That steel though. This is a plastic sell. Their company that, uh, is uh, they make these one off little dolls and then you, it the. Oh, these are hand painted little kid. Yeah. This guy's a beast, man. A plastic sell on instagram. He makes all the stuff that's pretty rad. No, he's, he's wicked. He made one for my dog. Oh, he did? John wick and his dog. that's from john wick dose. Not john brick. Uno function. I'm twisted.

Speaker 2:          02:23:26       Can I have to couch surf from john wick one? I'm wrong. Moves from john wick one that he had the pit bull. Yeah, it was. Yeah. Yeah. John wick two. They killed the beagle and then he had the pit bull and they started going and killing spree. It doesn't have it three out now. They're another one working on it. It's coming out soon. Yeah, he's a cool cat. I ran into him at a deus ex machina down in santa monica, venice area. And he was on one of his bikes and super cool, rad dude, just, hey, what's up? And keanu reeves must be one of the nicest, coolest people in the planet because no one has a bad word to say about that guy ever. He might. He might be what we should all surprised or be. We should all aspire to be keaNu reeves who you might have sOme really crazy secrets that he's the nicest.

Speaker 2:          02:24:13       It seems like everybody runs into him, you know, like, I'm sure there's some people that ran into you or they call you the wrong way and they're all went sideways for a little bit. Nah, not really. I mean, but no fucking keanu reeves got it going on. But the point, what I was going to get to is one of the things that those movies did was they, they elevated the profile of those muscle cars because people saw that movie and they went this guy for. There's something about him. I know he's murdering people. I know he's the best at murdering people. I know he killed three guys in a bar with a pencil. I know that. But look how fucking cool he looks. He's got. He's got the dopest suits. He's killing people. He's not killing people in an under armour rash guard. Okay? He's killing people in the dopest suits. He stabbing people in the neck and he's driving a seventY chevelle ss. But the trick is unlocks your fore mentioned in loved eleanor. It wasn't plasticized. It was a real fricken muscle car. Didn't have shit hanging all over it. And extra side pipes. YOu're right, you're right. But you're also wrong because eleanor, look at that. God dammit, I'm going to kill somebody. I'm doing it just like that. God, come on, it gets

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       out of his shoe. He's got craters on it. Chevelle. Ss from 1970 with krieger's. It's torque for us. Look at our control or this. Yeah, look how good he looks with that craig or style, um, that. That's a classic white wall tire. I mean, come on man. Or white letter tire. Raised white letters. Come on. That's class. Or you can get your own. Now you can get your name on it. You could do anything because of gas. There's a time that sells these stickers, monkey tires. I should, but you can actually order stickers now that, that are the rubber letters that fused themselves into the rubber on your tire. So you end up with a white letter like that and you put anything on there. Wow. Like joe roGan or you know, constantly. Pretty sure someone's going to send you and me photos of their car.

Speaker 3:          02:26:17       A 1970 chevelle rolling around with screener.com. Another company that does. It's going to send a sets for our car. I don't think. I don't think they'll let you in the golf course that she had after the burrito incident. I guarantee you they'll make it on small little golf cart tires. I need a set of tires for 10 inch wheel. Need a smaller font? Please try to fix this electric golf cart. That's all. I'Ve got a golf cart. I dragged my neighborhood. That's insane. It's a polaris like four cedar with the little truck bed. and uh, I drive it all around the neighborhood because I got a nice little neighborhood and get to the grocery store. I get to get something to eat, could go to the bar or whatever. And uh, so I raised total hell with this thing. I dropped through people's yards, you know, I'm, I'm a great neighbor because I'm really fun and if I do accidentally fuck something up, I will definitely pay for it. But at the same time they're like, okay, does it have to have 32,000 speakers on it? And a 50 inch television screen.

Speaker 3:          02:27:17       A white wall. Tires don't exist. What happened to white wall tires? But the only exists on classic cars. Oh yeah. You're not going to see him or anything new, but the lettered tires are starting to get more popular with brand new ones. But the white wall now remember the four or five inch white wall. All right. I'm going to tell you, I'm going to talk to you about a polarizing issue. Yeah. Ready? Raw. Well, porsches, I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm talking about. Nope. those wide body weird japanese style body kits they put on old porsches, liberty walk shit or giant white ass bodies are a. You got it. I don't know anything about here is r a u h w e l t. How the fuck do you not know about this? Can afford collecting porsches, but none of these are old cars. These are not the most expensive cars. The one that's an old accordion bumper that's been smoothed out. And so it's like 78, 79. But you see the bolt on bumpers or the. Excuse me, the bolt on fender flares. I like that we in the front. Yeah. Well this gentleman out of Japan

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       and he does all of these raw welt cars by hand and uh, go to him. What is the guy's name? So I could uh, give the guy that his props. But that dude right there with the. I love r w t shirt on. He's a, his name is kierra and the chi and he all raw. Well cars he does himself. So he'll fly out from Japan. He saw cells, you're fucking fenders off. Puts these flares on the front and the rear. There's some amazing videos of him because he's a real character. He's chain smoking cigarettes the entire time and he's like measuring the shit. He does it all by hand. He lays the caulking around the edge by weather sealing. That's the guy right there.

Speaker 3:          02:29:05       I'm going out on a limb, then I'm going to invite him to come to Texas and do my rave. I will in porsche. Well, I've been considering doing a wide body on my race just for the hell of it. And I would let him go do it if he would be interested in it. That would be amazing episode. But if you wanted to just do what he does and, and, and you know, get a porsche, like that's kind of his style, but he takes these things and makes them fucking cartoonish wide. Well fuck. That just cracks me up. You're dealing with like 20 inch tires. That's fricken super close. They're outstanding. My deal with gas monkey, like you say, okay, well I could actually tell you, yeah, we can do that, but I'm like, this guy's known for bringing us as in let's have some fun. Let's watch his talent. I gotta I gotta I gotta situation there. That's what rutledge from top gear, you know, rutledge would, uh, I know the name, he's a nice guy, super nice guy. He's been on this podcast before. He's doing one of those cars and he's doing it with a, an ls swap. So instead of using an air cooled engine, we already did it. Oh, you already did that.

Speaker 3:          02:30:14       It's a good move. Why is it so prohibitive? Oh, I don't know. It's a porsche people, you know, the scientists, the seinfelds of the worlds and god bless you side. They're like, ah, it's not original purists. We did a nine slash nine slash 2000 2001 convertible and did the ls swap. And we finished that in 2000 late 2016. And I had a brand new 2017, nine slash 11 turbo s, uh, in the signal green. And if I didn't mess with the buttons, if I didn't turn off all the stuff, I could not get away from that car till about 140 miles an hour. I couldn't get away. Look at this thing. This is it. Look at that. Who is lord? We went freaking. Oh, you changed the headlights to so nine, nine, six. He went with a nine, nine, seven headlines. That car was so frigging with nine slash 11 gt three. The front where the bumper is. Open vents. Oh my goodness. Car was fricking great. Dairy really tear it up. That's beautiful. Where is it? A friend of mine owns it. I told him, I said,

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       you can buy the car, but if you ever sell it, you've got to ask me first. He would fuck him. I know, right? Fuck him, tony. Tony, you suck. You have that car. The thing about those, it's so weird that you're not allowed to do that, but. But hell, that was three years ago, man. Oh my goodness. There's not again. All right. Put that right next to the mustang. Mach one. It's not better. It's just different. Yeah, there's whole fucking credible. They both have the same reaction like that car, which is a 2001. That was like a zero or a one. Yeah. Was that car? The way it's modified, the way it's put together, it is so fucking pretty. If you had that next in that 69 mach one, they're just a different taste. It's a different feel, but that's a fucking amazing car and maybe in the future you might look at that one even better when you consider the performance. That's my other car. A tuner. We built the down there, the two 80. See the green one.

Speaker 2:          02:32:22       I always wanted to 40, but that's a to 80 with 13,000 original miles and we went nuts with that. And did the whole a lexus swap as 22 jays, whatever. Let her tires. Oh yeah. Bringing them back at car was cool. I sold it to a customer, no bullshit for a pretty amazing amount of money for a to a to z and it was being shipped and the truck burn to the fucking ground. Yeah. What happened? Who knows? But the whole trailer burn to the ground. Well, you know how there's been these fires out here in the northeast, but still do you know about California has had some pretty crazy fires. There's a guy up the street that are really nice. Three series bmw burned to the ground. It's still sitting there. I took pictures of it. I put it on my instagram out. You need to tell him to call me.

Speaker 2:          02:33:12       Here's what I think we do because there have been some really amazing cars that have burned with the fires that happened this past year. The panels are still good though, right? Don't worry about the panels. We take them. I need to make you this in here. This conference table. You take it and that's it. So you take the real special car that burned down. You blow everything out, you clear coated so it doesn't stink and what have you. We put a glass top on it and you have a conference table called burning up the competition who are whatever, but I think I think some of those really expensive burned out cars would make really cool. Conference tables. Yeah. Good art projects. Yeah, for sure. Background. You got lucky bitch. Just having a big plaque. You got lucky bitch. You weren't in the wrong place. The wrong time. Yeah, I. I'm a big fan of those. E 46 m three's those 2000 ish. I do not know him. I don't know, can I be a w dot? There you go. Good. I'm in american hot. Rodder customs silver. He forTy six m.

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       he was saying so many numbers. I was worried you were baiting me to see if I'd like that. Yeah, those are cool. There was no 40 6:00 PM. Three 46.

Speaker 2:          02:34:26       It's a super well balanced. Fifty slash 50 balance car from like 2002, three and many people think it's like the gold standard for [inaudible] because [inaudible] there's something that happened at [inaudible] and right now I liked the fact that it [inaudible] became an m for like stay right there. Don't move [inaudible] muscular car. That's a fucking good looking car because the [inaudible] is a totallY different thing than an m three. It's beautiful and it's amazinG. Like an [inaudible] from bmw is a, an amazing driver. like if you want to drive that car every day, you'll be super pleased. That performance is unprecedented in the edm world and most of the car world, the only things that are faster like fucking gtrs and corvettes that are zr one zero, zero six as a shit. But it's different because in m three was really light, it was really light and uncomplicated. There wasn't any traction control or if there was, it was minimal. Mostly it was just antilock brakes and it was a, you know, 3000 pound car and it had 333 horsepower and is perfectly balanced for the right amount of thrust, the right amount of grip with the tires because they weren't the widest tires, but they were wide enough. they a little bit of fender flare that made them wider than a standard three series. And it's just a perfect understated looking car. When you look at that [inaudible] 46 and three, you look at that car like that sudden that's a fucking good neutral zone. LIke they nailed it.

Speaker 3:          02:35:53       Cool. If anybody has one of those I'm buying, you can reach me to cast mucky duck, sell it, sold it, right? Well what we do is we buy like 10 or 20 of them and then we sell one at auction for like 15 times what they normally bring them. Then we sell the rest of them. But look at that car. That's pretty damn good. It's good car

Speaker 2:          02:36:13       you want, but there's a balance. That car. It's not like a ferrari for 88 or some shit like that where it's so outrageous. Everybody goes, everybody gets light.

Speaker 3:          02:36:22       no, see you got me there because I don't like rear engines. Oh, you don't? Not in the ferrari tyPe stuff because to me know if you get a friend engine b12 you're a sore. Look at that. If you've got one behind you. Oh, you just got a contract of some sort and you might not have that car next week. Look at that car. Alright. Do you own one? No, I think I need to. Cool. I need to eat 46 m three in my life. Look at that. That's a. It might be. It's perfectly understated and yet flashy. It's like a balance. So what's the value on that right now? Because I'm serious. I don't watch that kind of car. They're not crazy. They're not crazy becauSe I think people overlook them. They overlook them for more extravagant, like [inaudible], which is the v eight years. So if you go buy one, what would you pay for one right now? Let me just a nice California wine. No rust. I have brain damage so I've critical thinking,

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       see, know off. I'd have to call my buddy dennis on something like that because I just don't know. Those kinds of cars. There's something about that car that's very appealing because it's a balance issue. It's not like there's something about the mach one that's like, holy shit, you know, like America. Fuck yeah. So here's what, here's what we do. We, we put it out to the people listening. Bring us a nice one owner, low mile in three that it hasn't been dragged out. Six 46, 46 m three that it hasn't been dragged out and I'll bid against you and we'll see who gets it. I had to m three's in a row at least two and three's in a row from bmw for the v eight years because it was so good. It was my daily driver. It was so good. After I would get out of it, I was like, this car is everything.

Speaker 2:          02:38:01       I like. It's understated and yet it's wicked, it's got veto power, but yet it's not preposterous. Like the wheels don't break loose every time you hit the gas it has a double clutch transmission, so it's good and traffic and it also has a whale because it's got this high revving va and in so many things that I liked. I got them in a row so they're going to send this one on the inter webs and then we'll send the shit. I got a pretty good reach. I think I can get ahold of bmw. No, I couldn't get ahold of the people that own one in their garage right now that are probably a at the golf club. So we'll just bid against each other. So you'll get to. Because I don't know what will happen. I'll let you get it by a different one. I'm not that stupid pro. How about we do this?

Speaker 2:          02:38:48       Let's buy two of them and race. Um, I'm not good at racing. Straight line. I don't care who gets there first. I just like driving and no bullshit, no bullshit from your wife. But for real, I don't. I like watching racing, but I really don't care if you get there first. All I care is about going sideways and correcting and hitting the target proper apex and stomping on the gas and knowing when to brake and knowing when to like dig in. If you get ahead of me, I don't give a fuck. I really don't. I'm just trying to have fun because I'm not a professional racer. NeIther of if that's all I wanted to do. If I was danica patrick, then that's what I'd be into. But I'm not and I, I don't. I really just like driving cars. Yeah, me too. I'm not a racer at all. If you and I drove, I would let you win because I'd like you. Oh yeah. I'd let you win because I like you. So we're just going to be sitting at the starting line. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Two thousand, 140 6:00 PM. Three 25. I don't want to convertible. Yeah, I think that uh, if you're going to drive it, drive a car, then you don't want to start with I have one convertible. I have a 1965. It will find that hey, let's find one on there and I'll buy it right now.

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       I called the guy I know. Go sell them one of those. Well you got 100 $8,500. We'll get that 46, six speed. Low miles. $13,000. You can't even buy a 69 mach one for anywhere near that. Not even near that. That's a good car too. I would love that. Caused some stereo. He keeps it covered. I'm a fan. I'm a fan. I just think that there's some years palace. Virtus. Super close. Okay. If he can be here in the next uh, 20 minutes before we get it done or however you want that close. It's basically a long beach. It's like an hour and a half. Long term here is like four hours. Three? Yeah. Three pm. It's four hours. Yeah. It was sad that. What do they got? long beach. Nothing. His last queen, the queen. A queen elizabeth. Whatever. The queen mary. the queen mary. Yeah. There's a laugh factory down there in long beach.

Speaker 3:          02:41:08       There's a lot of things. A lumpy cfo always wanted to try comedy. Really? I, I, I, um, I just want to try it tonight. No, I'm not exactly prepared. I can make it happen. I just don't know how. I mean, I, I know that it's a, I mean, it's a very rigid process and you have to really refine. And I've looked at it, I've studied it and I'm like, I think I could probably a funny dude. I think you could do it 100 percent. No bullshit. You 100 percent. Could be a comedian. I needed to go to comedian school does. Doesn't exist. Oh really? Yeah. This is what you gotta do you gotta make friends with professional comedians? Will be honest with you. Like this is like what? One of the beautiful things about comedy is that it's very much a, a brothership and a sister for sure.

Speaker 3:          02:41:52       I've seen it. Yeah. There's a brotherhood and sisterhood that exists with comedies where there's no institutions. Even though it's like one of the favorite things of people. People love to laugh. It's one of the rare things that gives you a very specific reaction. Like if you go to see a movie and it's like a rock movie like jumanji or something. It's fun. Sometimes it's funny. Sometimes it's exciting, but it's a bunch of shit going on. You go to a c stand up, you got to see Kevin Hart standup you. You're going there because Kevin Hart is drug dealer. Okay. That drug is laughter. He's here to hit you with some fucking high level gigantic arena laughter. And you get to walk out of there going, holy shit. That was fun. Yeah. Woo. Like he gave you some drugs. Ah, no. I, I think I might try one day. You can do an open mic. Go out there and go. Hey, I'm, I'm richard from a screener.com.

Speaker 3:          02:42:46       You can do it. There's a lot of places. Addison improv. Good spot. Yeah. Addison improv is great. It's a great spot. Not only that, not only is that great, right next door is the cobi steakhouse. Yes. And you can get out of the chop shop and if you get hammered you can go to that piano bars. That piano bars till their piano bar is still there, but I'm the right next to coby is the, uh, memphis. Uh, it'S a lounge memphis lounge and that's always a time I have met a few of my wives there.

Speaker 3:          02:43:17       I've worked at many times. That's a fun place to work. I used to love to do that circuit. What I would do is cap city in austin and I would do the improv. Well when did the. There is an improv and addison, but there's another improv to write that. I haven't done that in fort worth. I think so. I think there's one like 40 minutes away. Yeah, it's like fort worth. And then there was a laugh stop in houston and that was the run. We'll see. Dallas, you need to, you need to do gas monkey live. I hold about 2007 people. And what is it? You have a concert place? Yeah, I've had motley crue there. Dude. I graduated high school in [inaudible] 87 and somebody had told me two things. One, you're going to build a car. That hot wheels is going to make and to you're going to a motley crew at your bar.

Speaker 3:          02:44:01       I'm like, no way. That's incredible. So is this the place that you were building on your show? Yeah. Yeah. You have a 2000 seat place there? Yeah, I think we're 22 now. What's, what's really bitching about this is uh, the, the stage is solid concrete. It's not raised. So the reverb and the and the sound that we get out of there. Even the guys from crew when they played it was a deal with dodge and me and them and bob, they were supposed to come in and play like 41 minutes or something and they played for like an hour and a half and we're like, we hadn't played anything like this in decades. And the sound is fucking insane. That is so cool. Dude. You're like an uber businessman. He just dip your toes in everything. I call myself an entrepreneur because I always put my hands into shit shit.

Speaker 3:          02:44:54       So yeah, I didn't run across the street. You got a restaurant bar. You're making music. Music venues? Yeah. I were doing an energy drink, gas monkey energy in it. We're in every 7:11 in the us with the gas monkey energy. It's not energy drink. It's powered with all kinds of b vitamins and we where our sugar, we use real honey. Better deal all the way around. Wow. You get it from slave bees? Uh, yeah. Well I didn't know if there was any other crack the whip box b. I had a bit about that, about how you're a vegan. One of the most crazy things about being a vegan. It's you can't eat honey. Did you? Probably the oldest substance for nutrition in the world. It's one of them. It's definitely the top million, but that these bees are not like your slaves. You can't just force them to make honey.

Speaker 3:          02:45:51       Yeah. You can stick them in the box. They don't care. They don't. They don't even know what's going on. Do you think there's any honeybee trafficking going on? Yes, for sure. And it's awful. it needs to stop and it's mostly by white people. I was living in la the other day and this lady had like 24 eggs and they were scanning on a. Well, you never know someone's. They make fake eggs. They do and you could put drugs in that fake egg. No bullshit. Yeah. Yeah. It really is. Look, if you're a drug dealer and you're making millions of dollars off cocaine and ag of coke, imagine how fucking how valuable an egg filled with coke would be there. Yeah, like a rocker coke. That big. Take a guest jamie. how about like an ostrich egg filled with coke austrian tank full of coke? Yeah, a good goose egg. I haven't done anything like that and says, oh, they're really, really small job. Ostrich egg filled with coke. Google that. Don't be scared. It probably comes up. That's the problem with google is like you're sitting there thinking with your buddy or shoot the shit and you're like, oh, I just thought of something really cool and googling like, nah, fuck. It's probably someone getting arrested for having an up their ass. Did you see that cia spy kit where they had to stick it up their ass? Fugitive. Ostrich farm fraudster martin. Every extra dime.

Speaker 3:          02:47:15       Is that kind of an ostrich egg up his ass? Is that what you're doing? And this berg, he was doing drug dealing with ostriches oh, how did he get the drugs in the ostrich? Uh, uh, it would be beak, not nostrils. Well, they have nationals. Can weird man. I knew a guy, you know, you haven't done a lot of the world rallies and I'm the gumball. $3,000 of the bull runs and all this. So one guy appeared on the scene for a few years and it was kind of weird. He was there but he wasn't there and he was kinda not really competing, but he had all these expensive cars. It turns out that that's all he'd been doing for four or five years, was shipping these cars from town to town, uh, on regular shipping trucks full of drugs because who's going to search a lamborghini?

Speaker 3:          02:48:03       Mercy lacoe. Right. Would just assume he's there for the gumball rally. Meanwhile, he's a dope dealer. Exactly. Now that guy, I think he's in the jail now. One of the things about cars, right? It's like cars. They, they, uh, men's baser instincts respond to cars. You know, it's something about like, like a lamborghini, like, ah, there's something about those cars. It's like you want to kind of slightly slightly escape from society's constraints. Oh yeah. But I'm not a, I'm not a fan with the, those cars. I do it with the old cars. Yeah, like the old shit. I mean I have some new stuff. Don't get me wrong logos either. It's just something about, well there's some weird so wide and big and crazy and it's so can't get in and out. I mean, it's so rich too. Every now and then on sunset, front of the comedy story seeking these guys was flying by the comedy store and the cars are like five fucking miles wide. Each cars, they're super wide. Yeah. And you always know

Speaker 2:          02:49:07       the asshole that doesn't know what he's doing because he's pushing in the collection. There's no catch. There's no clue. Well, not anymore. He's putting this neutral and doing it literally doesn't exist. These guys that drive around and they're like, you know, look at me now. I'm like, dude, just travel car. You don't ever get the satisfaction and washed them stall out anymore though. Like someone who doesn't know how to do this is true. I sold out my bronco and I was everybody around me that was looking at this car that got jealous. That's for you feel better about yourself. I'll fucking stalled out to lose. Ah fuck.

Speaker 2:          02:49:46       Everybody had to wait an extra 30 seconds and they're all like, you fucking loser. Nah, pretty bad ass bronco. It's about as bronco, but you ever been to los anica boulevard right? When it hits sunset, that's a steep ass. Hell, bro. You got to come around to dudes with manual stall out on that motherfucker. Yeah, we started the gumball 3000 there one time. Oh really? We started on that hill. You had to clear that light just to go. That's a good move to these screwed up all the top. That's a good move. They should've never mowed down the blues though while they voted down. Here's the thing, I agree with you 100 percent, but yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not scared.

Speaker 2:          02:50:27       Round number. What is this? The thing about the house of blues, that was bad ass though when it went away. So I live with my friend. Yes sir. A new friend. So you're going to teach me comedy. [inaudible] 100 percent help you out. Um, when it was down, when they tore it down from the comedy store, you could see across and you see all the beautiful lights, like the lights in the hollywood hills. I had a buddy of mine bought a house in a off a doe heaney, which is like way above the hill. You'd go to his backyard. He would look out the lights. You'd be like, this doesn't even seem real. It's like blade runner, like most people see the lights when you're down in them. But when you're above hollywood career, looking down, it's one of the most spectacular views in all of history.

Speaker 2:          02:51:13       It's way better than any New York city view because you have a view on top. Look at that. That's what you see. And I'm telling you, man, this is dog shit compared to my friend larry's house. You'd look out there, you look at that and you go, holy shit. That's incredible. It was mesmerizing. The image was stunning. That's pretty good. A couple people that have houses up there. I know dane cook's got a crazy house up there. Like a lot of guys have houses up there that looked down like I've always wanted to meet him. He's a rad dude. Yeah, he's at the comedy store all the time. Well he's. What was that show? He did my best friend's girl or whatever. I think it was a movie. Yeah. Movie that is probably one of the veterans that was out there. It's pretty fucking hilarious. What's your all time favorite movie if you had a. If there was one, one move. Smokey the bandit. God damn. Every time. And, and if I had to get an in depth

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       and think about it, I might go with stroker ace where the giant uh thing, uh, the smoke tower failed. He goes right under it because these guys were doing their own stunts. That shit was real. That when cgi and they were doing it. What was that one movie with the girl? Her name was domino. Uh, he was a detective called domino. Was it called domino? I don't remember who. Was that? What it's called? Are we talking about with burt reynolds? Yeah. Yeah. You know like the, what's it called? Domino during cannibal run. When they drove the car into the pool. Oh yeah, like the nascar looking thing. Yeah. They did that because they were fucking drunk. They were loaded and they were partying and the camera's just having to be rolling that. And that wasn't planned. It wasn't part of the script. They did it because they thought it was funny.

Speaker 3:          02:52:50       What is it called? Sharkey's machine. That's right. Sharkey's machine. God damn what years? That 81. I was 14 years old. I remember watching this movie on tv. I was like, god damn, I wish I was burt reynolds and the woman who was his girlfriend. Oh my god. She was so hot. Look at her leg warmer days. That's when they. Yeah, they had a leg warmers back then. No one had a. Nasa didn't even figure out when they figured out assets, sir. Mix a lot, ladies and gentlemen, why people were in the days. We didn't even know what to ask was sir. Mix a lot. Came along and changed the game. He came along with baby, got back and we were like, wait, wait, wait. Oh my god, that is better. It was like everybody just got smelling salts under their nose and then the kardashians fucked it up for all this.

Speaker 3:          02:53:38       Everybody woke up, I think did, but they didn't. They exploited a hole in the system. You know like Jennifer Lopez had strong ass game way before them, but it was a legit latina asking. Correct from years of dancing and fucking running upstairs and shit. Right? Correct. Whatever the fuck she did. Well also she's like four foot two machine. It's just pretty short. She's probably five foot one or something and she was pretty short pack it all in small area. He got to get it in. But those movies, man, like burt reynolds movies for whatever, deliverance doesn't get the respect it deserves. That is one of the all time greatest drama movies of all time. I actually have a picture when I was filming with burton's house, a similar in my phone. I'll never find it. Uh, but um, I was in his memorabilia room which also doubled as a weight room and just there was stuff everywhere and I was texting away, I was dealing with a problem and somebody snapped a picture of it and the deliverance, a canoe is laying up against the wall and there's all these different memorabilia things in there. And when I say memorabilia like that, it was like a hoarding room. There was just. Everything was in there and it was unbelievable. It's like the most surreal thing because I'm hammering away and there's like everything behind you do that. Did you. Here's the other thing about that movie. And by the way, burt reynolds, university of Florida played football was a fucking

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       dud. Yeah. That movie introduced me to the world of compound bows. I didn't even know what a compound bow was until I saw that movie. I don't know what a combo is now for bowhunting pro pro man bell. Ronald burt reynolds reynolds. I was taking a bow. Hey, uh, jackson needs you to Barbara Reynolds. Dr. Jackson. I was going to say it's also a big bowhunter, but something about that movie. Like when, who was the guy who was getting fucked when they squealed like a pig? What was his name? The actor? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Ned beatty. Thank you. Ned beatty. Got damn good actor. Holy shit. You were so scared for him. Well, uh, what's his face? Did it later on in the movie? Was it.

Speaker 2:          02:55:50       Who was the other actor that didn't another. Maybe later on. Was it fiction or Bruce Willis? Nah, he got caught and he's down there. He's like, we're never going to talk about this again. right? What was that? Pulp fiction. But because the gap came out. yeah, yeah, yeah. That was what it was. Yeah, that's right. That's right. We're never going to talk about this. This didn't happen. Do you think quinn tanti would come on? Yeah, for sure. What? He's got that new movie coming out. Definitely wins this new movie coming out. I think they're either just wrapping, filming it right now or it's like they're getting close to. Maybe they just finished. On a scale of one to 10, how high do you think he's willing to get blast off? Why not? Let's see. Does doesn't? I know that he doesn't, but he does. What else is he going to do? You go through life pretending. Just come in and talk about movies. He loves movies. Good. Me too. I love his movies.

Speaker 2:          02:56:46       It's 3:10. Should we wrap this bitch up? I don't know man. What do you got? I'm trying to see if any of my social crap is. Don't look at that stuff. Listen, might something good to talk about. You introduced to a new dimension of social media within the last three hours and I suggest you leave your phone alone much more often.
