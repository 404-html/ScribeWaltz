Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, we're also paying for the sins of a lot of other people, like for centuries let's, you know, white American men dominated everything in this country and like, you know, there's also a reality of a lot of people were treated like garbage for a long time and a lot of promises were broken and there's a reality to that. That's not excuse making, it's not, it's a real thing. And then they say, well, you know why people have benefited from that system leading to. So what's happening is in an effort to balance the playing field a little bit, a lot of us today are being treated unfairly because the balancing act is making things go so far and like I do understand that. That's why I had a conversation after a tosh has a 10. Who did they get? Oh, Tracy's gay jokes. And I had to get from folks who don't know, Tracy Morgan did a joke about if someone was gay who had stabbed them.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Yeah. And everybody went crazy and I had a couple of gay comics on Rick Chrome, Jim David, and we talked about this on this comedy special I did. And uh, the as Comedians, I asked them how do they feel about the imbalance in the language, like the fact that you get in trouble for that now and Jim Davidson, I'm okay with it. And uh, I'm like, well, how are you okay with it as a comic? And he goes, because it's not a level playing field, meaning what he thought was like in life, gay people had not treated as well, so he didn't give a shit if, if that guy got into a little bit more trouble. And I kind of, I heard what he said. They're like, even though I don't want to get in trouble for it, in that sense, he was right. It's like, you know, we still have a big segment of our country that can't get married and they're treated like second class citizens.

Speaker 1:          01:30          But yet we go around and tell other countries how to live their lives were so full of shit. It makes me nuts. Well, I think there's a real legitimate argument in the idea that until it balances out, until everyone completely relaxes on discrimination towards gays, like, like there's no discrimination on bachelors anymore, you know, like if a man has a 50 year old man, he says, I'm just not getting married again, there's no discrimination or social, not a social pariah, but if he decides to marry a man than it is like, well what? Well, what is that and why is that not eradicated from our culture that? Well, once that is eradicated from our culture, then I think people are going to be much more likely to accept gay jokes much more like. Because I keep hearing that gay jokes or homophobic and I'm like, guess what?

Speaker 1:          02:16          No, they're not. It's not homophobic at all. It's a gay joke. Just like ha jokes about straight sex aren't header of Bobek. Alright. There are jokes about sex and there's, there's jokes about everything and it's really about context. It's not about the subject matter and you can't eliminate certain subject matters. You just can't because the human language is very nuanced. There's a lot of shit going on and every single interaction that you have, we're humor could potentially be crafted from. It can be taken in a whole wide variety of different ways and I like all of those ways. I like people saying fucked up shit. They don't really mean. Sure. I think there's something funny and Tracy Morgan saying if a photo most good. I mean it's ridiculous. It's ludicrous, right? It's not real. Of course he wouldn't do that. Of course it would be. You know, it's, it's ridiculous. The idea that it's like, I do a joke. I'm like, guess what? Johnny cash didn't really shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die either. Maybe. I don't think he did. He might have more likely that he did it. Then Tracy Morgan would establish son, stupid johnny. Johnny. Johnny cash probably should have said I took some pills and fell asleep on the tour bus. They might be more accurate. Longest boxing match ever. Let's find out.

Speaker 2:          03:30          March ever typing

Speaker 1:          03:34          was the longest boxing match in history. Oh my God. A boxing match landed. Lasted seven hours already. If I can do the man fuck is that. Is that real?

Speaker 1:          03:48          Oh my God. Listen to this. The longest boxing match ever took place in New Orleans on April sixth of 18, 93. The matches between Andy Bowen and Jack Burke, both of whom claimed the lightweight title. After the reigning champ, Jack Mccall full all of fee all fluffy Jack Mccall. If he retired, the winner of this take all purse was set at $2,500 and in order to decide who is really the new champion, that match was set to fought to a finish. They fought to a finish like that all through the contest. Fighters went at each other aggressively pounding each other with their gloves, inflicting and sustaining tremendous punishment that read like someone wrote it with their pants off. That Red Light is vigorously oiled, up and shaved and are yet three minute rounds wore off. Oh my God. They went to a hundred and 11 rounds. Both fighters, dazed and weary gave up and did not come out of their corner.

Speaker 1:          04:47          Pull zoos or you can't fight one hundred and twelfth round. We'll move. It'd be one guy telling them, just get up rocky here and you'll win Guinness. Guinness says it's 276 rounds in 18, 25 English people might. We heard it much longer than that. We are. Endurance is superior with proper boxing training. That sounded more South African, so maybe they're right man. I don't know. Whoever fought over 100 rounds is the craziest fucking human being that's ever lived. That fight was only four and a half hours. Oh, that's weird. One of the 32nd rounds. It doesn't even make sense. I can't even do the math. I'm not going to try 2,500 bucks. That's crazy.

Speaker 1:          05:31          For the welter with a welterweight championship of the world, what are lightweight rather these days? It's a good question. It's a very good question. I've been at building a million bucks. Yeah. Is that weird? Like when you hear about like economies imploding and then all of a sudden like a loaf of bread is worth a million dollars. How the fuck, what does that even mean? Yeah. I don't even understand that people have billions of dollars. How does that number even a real number and can I have you? I'll pull out a billion dollars in cash. Let me see. Yeah. At a certain point in time, you have to admit the hack the game. Okay. You hacked the game somehow. Dude, how'd you get $10,000,000,000? Don't understand. When you know you're a guy like Bill Gates, you have submarine inside your giant bear. You know like, Hey, what happened here? What did exactly that you do?

Speaker 1:          06:14          Where are you getting all that money is this. This isn't fair. You have escape pause in your house to jettison you to the middle of the fucking ocean. Whenever it fucking dangerous shows up. Yeah. You have a constant team of security detail run you. That's like having a bank. You know around you all the time. Bill Gates is worth what? A hundred billion or something crazy like that. It would have fit with that whole jv. Him dropping $40,000. He shouldn't pick it up kind of thing. Yeah, that's what they say. It's like if he drops $40,000, it's worth more of his time to keep moving forward than it is to turn around and pick it up. He just was. What happened was he just didn't turn around to pick up the bonus. I just got almost for, for bludgeoning another man for 15 minutes. He, if he dropped that, he wouldn't pick it up. Oh Shit. Itunes or recording to server, get the fuck outta here. Server.
