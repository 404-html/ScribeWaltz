Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, we're also paying for the sins of a lot of other people. Like for centuries, let's, you know, white American men dominated everything in this country. And, and like, you know, there's also a reality of a lot of people were treated like garbage for a long time and a lot of promises were broken. And there's a reality to that. That's not excuse making, it's not right. It's a real thing. And, and then they say, well, you know why people have benefited from that system even to, so what's happening is in an effort to balance the fucking playing field a little bit, a lot of us today are being treated unfairly because the balancing act is making things go so far. Like I do understand that. Like, that's why I had a conversation after a Tashas. Uh, uh, and who did they get? Oh, Tracy's gay jokes.

Speaker 1:          00:45          And I had a couple of days from folks who don't know, Tracy Morgan did a joke about if his son was gay, he would stab them. Yeah. And everybody went crazy. And I had a couple of gay comics on Rick Chrome and Jim David and we talked about this on this comedy special I did. And uh, the as Comedians, I asked them how do they feel about the imbalance in the language? Like the fact that you get in trouble for that now. And Jim David said, I'm okay with it. And uh, I'm like, well how are you okay with there's a comic? And he goes, cause it's not a level playing field. Meaning what he thought was like in life, gay people had not treated as well. So he didn't give a shit if, if that guy got in a little bit more trouble and I kind of, I heard what he said, they're like, even though I don't want to get in trouble for it, in that sense he was right.

Speaker 1:          01:23          It's like, you know, we still have a big segment of our country that can't get married and they're treated like second class citizens, but yet we go around and tell other countries had to live their lives were so fully shit. It makes me nuts. Well, I think there's a real legitimate argument in the, uh, idea that until it balances out, until everyone completely relaxes on discrimination towards gays. Like, like there's no discrimination on bachelors anymore. You know, like if a man is a 50 year old man, he says, I'm just not getting married again. There's no discrimination or social pro. He's not a social pariah. But if he decides to marry a man than it is like, well what? Well, what is that and why is that not eradicated from our culture yet? Well, once that is eradicated from our culture, then I shank people are going to be much more likely to accept gay jokes much more like, because I keep hearing that gay jokes or homophobic and I'm like, guess what?

Speaker 1:          02:16          No, they're not. It's not homophobic at all. It's a gay joke. Just like jokes about straight sex aren't Hetero volvic alright, they're jokes about sex and there's, there's, there's jokes about everything and it's really about context. It's not about the subject matter and you can't eliminate certain subject matters. You just can't because the human language is very nuance. There's a lot of shit going on in every single interaction that you have. We're humor could potentially be crafted from, it can be taken into a whole wide variety of different ways, and I like all of those ways. I like people saying fucked up shit. They don't really mean. Sure. I think this something funny and Tracy Morgan saying if a photo, most of them was good, I still be a little new glue and it's ridiculous. It's ludicrous, right? It's not real. Of course he wouldn't do that. Of course it would be, you know, it's, it's ridiculous. The idea that it's like, I do a joke in my act like guess what, Johnny Cash didn't really shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die either. Maybe it's, I don't think he did. He might more likely that he did it then Tracy Morgan would stab his son. Yeah. So bid johnny, johnny, Johnny Cash probably should have said I took some pills and fell asleep on the tour bus. I'd be more accurate. Longest boxing match ever. Let's find out.

Speaker 2:          03:30          Match ever boiled typing

Speaker 1:          03:34          was the longest boxing match in history. Oh my God, a boxing match land. It lasted seven hours. How many, if I can do the math man, what the fuck is that? Is that real?

Speaker 2:          03:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Oh my God. Listen to this. The longest boxing match ever took place in New Orleans on April six of 1893 the matches between Andy Bowen and Jack Burke, both of whom claimed the lightweight title after the reigning Champ, Jack McCall, full all of fee, all a fee check my call if he retired, the winner of this take all purse was set at $2,500 and in order to decide who is really the new champion, the match was set to fought to a finish. They fought to a finish. I like that. All through the contest, fighters went at each other aggressively pounding each other with their gloves, inflicting and sustaining tremendous punishment. That red, like someone wrote it with their pants off. That red light is a vigorous. They masturbating oiled up and shaved and ah, yet three minute rounds wore off. Oh my God. They went to 111 rounds. Both fighters, dazed and weary gave up.

Speaker 1:          04:45          And did not come out of their corner pools. Well, you can't fight on hundred and 12th around how to be one guy telling him just get up rocky and your win. Guinness Guinness says it's 276 rounds in 1825 that's the English people. Why might we heard it much longer than that? Our endurance is superior. We've proper boxing training. That sounded more South African, so maybe they're right, man. I Dunno. Whoever fought over a hundred rounds is the craziest fucking human being that's ever lived. That fight was only four and a half hours. Oh, that's weird. What do they have a 32nd rounds? Hmm. It doesn't even make sense. I can't even do the math. All right. I'm not going to try 2,500 bucks. That's crazy.

Speaker 2:          05:31          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:31          For the welter, the welterweight championship of the world are lightweight rather these days. That's a good question. It's a very good question. I've been to be like 1 million bucks. Yeah. Is that weird? Like when when you hear about like economies imploding and then all of a sudden like a loaf of bread is worth $1 million, like how the fuck, what does that even mean? Yeah. I don't even understand that people have billions of dollars. How does that number even a real number and can I, how do you pull out $1 billion in cash? Me? See? Yeah. At a certain point in time you have to admit the hack the game. Okay. You acting game somehow, dude, how'd you get $10 billion? I don't understand. When you know you gotta like Bill Gates, you have submarine and inside your giant bear, you know like, Hey, what happened here? What exactly did you do? Where are you getting all that money?

Speaker 1:          06:15          This is, this isn't fair. We have escape pause in your house to jettison you to the middle of the fucking ocean whenever it fucking danger shows up. Yeah. You have a constant team of security detail around you that's like having a bank, you know around you all the time. Bill Gates is worth what? 100 billion or something crazy like that. It would have. It was the whole Jv, him dropping $40,000 he shouldn't pick it up kind of thing. Yeah, that's what they say. It's like if he drops $40,000 it's worth more of his time to keep moving forward than it is to turn around and pick it up. He just, what? What happened was he just didn't turn around and pickup the bonus. I just got almost for, for bludgeoning and other man for 15 minutes. He, if he dropped that, he wouldn't pick it up, son. Oh Shit. Itunes or recording to server the fuck outta here. Server.
