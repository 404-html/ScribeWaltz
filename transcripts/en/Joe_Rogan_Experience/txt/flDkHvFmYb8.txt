Speaker 2:          00:02:53       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       Yeah, I, it's certainly is possible. When you look at the record and you look at this, a Homo Floresiensis, this hobbit man from Indonesia, when you look at the stories of this thing called the Orang Pendek, which is another, um, supposedly small hobbit, like furry creature that's running around. And then you hear the stories about these gigantic [inaudible] creatures that used to exist. It's recently as a hundred thousand years ago. Yes. You start going, okay, well there seems to have been a lot of different kinds of primates then of course, is that Russian, uh, a ancestor of human beings. It's found really recently that 41,000 years ago was a completely different type of human, was not a Neanderthal, was not a homosapien. It was something totally different. Yeah, and that's 40,000 years ago. So you're, it seems like as scientists accumulate more and more evidence, they're finding that there was a broad variety of primates that branched off in a bunch of different chains and it very well could have been that there's more than one intelligent one.

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       And it wasn't just human beings. It wasn't just human beings, Indiana talls. It wasn't just human beings. Neanderthals in this new one that Dave discovered, there might have been many more. The problem with fossils is it's really hard to leave a fossil when something dies. They just, it just rots. It gets absorbed by the earth. Bacteria eats it, animals eat it. That's what happens to most of us when we die. When you find a fossil, it's because something fell into mud or got caught in a lava field or does it has to be something really weird that happens twice. I remember. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:04:40       It's very rare for something to last on this planet very long after it dies.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       Yeah, so our view of like what used to exist is so weird because it's, it's based on such a small amount of data. Really kind of incredible when you stop and think about what they have discovered used to exist, especially when we're in regards to dinosaurs and all the different animals that have been extinct for millions and millions of years based on just this one way of acquiring the, the, you know, evidence of their body. A fossil.

Speaker 3:          00:05:13       Yeah. It's amazing. And that they can reconstruct what they looked like with some accuracy. It is fascinating, man. And all of this stuff has shown me how I'm a lazy skeptic. Like you know how there's people who just believe anything. Well, there's also the opposite of that, which is people who just disbelieve anything, they don't look into. Well, why? Why am I a skeptic? Why don't I believe this. This is the thing with people who roll their eyes at big foot. And by the way, after going squashing with you, I've gotten a lot of eye rolls when I tell people, yeah, maybe, maybe there's a big foot, but in silver lake, yeah, and Silver Lake and all you get is eyebrows. It's like seizures. If you tell somebody you believe in big foot, it's like watching someone on ecstasy, their eyes go so far back in their head.

Speaker 3:          00:05:57       But I've, the thing I've realized is that a lot of people will instantly say, I don't believe in that. And you say, well, why don't you believe in that? And they'll say, well, because it doesn't exist. And you say, well, why? What's your evidence that it doesn't exist? And they don't know. They have no evidence either way. So I think that's an interesting thing that I've discovered in myself, which is that I'm an automatic skeptic. When you would talk about big foot in earlier, podcasts are just on the phone with me and my mind. I'm like, this is fucking horse shit. Deep, deep, deep worship with no reason to believe, no reason to say that you, he's having not an IG investigated it at all, having not even done a web search on it, like really just not even thinking about it. And now I think, well, you know what, I think that there is, I think that it takes something a little bit more than fantasy to drive an anthropologist or a scientist or someone who only has their career to ruin out in the forest to hunt for a mystical monkey thing. I think that there needs to, there's some evidence out there that would make a person risk his entire career, uh, to come out publicly saying that he believes in big foot.

Speaker 1:          00:07:18       Yeah. Well this Homo Floresiensis, the, the hobbit man of Indonesia, just stop and think about that, that that was in 2005 was when they discovered these things. Just stop and think about if, if someone said, did you know before that, did you know that 13,000 years ago there was a type of human, a really tiny one that was Harry and sneaky and maybe stole human babies and made its own stone tools, but didn't grow any higher than three feet tall yet. Get outta here. But it's the St Lord of the Rings. Like you're making things up.

Speaker 3:          00:07:54       Yeah, go roll some d and d dice.

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       Dark, dark. But it was real. That was a real animal. I know for a fact. This is a bonafide real animal. Buried. It's dead. Lived in tribes, made stone tools three feet. What is that? Is that like that? Um, well, it's my penis times three.

Speaker 3:          00:08:21       Three feet.

Speaker 1:          00:08:22       Yes. Three feet tall. It was a tiny, tiny little guy. I'm a little, little, little creature and

Speaker 3:          00:08:29       think about that to this three foot creature. It lived in a land of giants where people would go lumbering through its forest. This is a real thing. This is people listening to this right now. It should just Google search this to know that tiny little hobbit men once wandered the earth. This existed.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       Yes, it really did. And very recent discovery. Less than a decade. Some people say they still exist. Yes. That's the other thing that there's a, there's reports of them, those islands, there's, there's so many islands in and around that area and there are reports that these things have been discovered on these islands by people that have explored and that the, the local say they've seen them and there's like, again, the Orang Pendek, which is another tiny little hairy man that has been reported being seen by people for many, many years. So it's, it's, it's possible if you think of that, the, the, the size of them and then us and then think of a big foot and then think of an elephant. I mean there's a lot of big things and there's a lot of little things on this planet and just because we haven't physically laid eyes on a big foot, we physically haven't seen a Sasquatch.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       We don't have a real good photo or a video of it. Doesn't mean it's not real. It doesn't mean it's not real. And just because many of the people who believe in big foot are several cards short of a full deck doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Just cause it crazy person says it. Thrill does not mean that. It's not real sure. I mean, how many crazy people were talking about this hobbit man and their minds, but I'm sure he shared a lot of people in that area. We're saying if there was a smarter man to tiny little furry man, yeah, bow and Arrow, he be like, get Outta here bitch. Man Stole my baby. Yeah. Ridiculous. Right? Nobody would ever possibly believe that. No. What, what I thought was interesting about the, uh, the squashing, first of all was that the guys who do it, they, I mean, they take it really seriously.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       Steve and John, they set up camera traps. They set up recording devices. They, they use thermal imaging. They, they really take it seriously. And if one day out of all this searching, if one day they actually do stumble upon one of these things, what a glorious moment it will be for them. And it'll be a glorious moment for me. I'll go out in the street and scream and joy if one of those guys finds pick fun and I would really hope it would be those guys. I mean, even more than us. I know it sounds like I'm being selfless, but we don't deserve it. And compared to the amount of time that those guys are putting in, they have full time jobs and yet they have vans that are set up for squatch and with solar panels on them. And they mean they have this, all these different pieces of technology, camera traps and time lapse photography things and audio recorders. I mean, they really, you know, they're, they're really trying, they're dedicated. And we need people like that. Look, you're not going to get the most sane people going out into the woods to look for bigfoot. That's hill. Some evidence, and then it'll be swarmed with real scientists. But if something happens and they actually get some concrete evidence where people are like, oh my God, it's, we're dealing with a real animal, then you're going to have teams of real scientists that are in the woods and those guys will get arrested. He's like,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       Oh yeah, you know what? They'll get in the way of the thing. They'll quarantine the whole area and all those guys will get hauled off. But I will say this, you know whether or not there's a big foot, if you want to turn a boring camping trip and do a fun camping trip, just gotten to the woods and pretend that you're looking for big. It's, it's the renaissance fair of camping. It's like go out there. Just believed in the possibility that there could be a big foot and start walking through the forest smoke some powerful Rogan. We'd, we probably can't talk about that, but if you go, I think that there is, I think that squashing is the renaissance fair of camping. It's an imaginary way that you can turn a boring camping trip into a thing that has the potential to transform human history forever.

Speaker 3:          00:12:45       And conversely, if you go squashing and you're unsuccessful at the very least, you went camping, you went camping, you can't lose. You went camping. And I remember when I was a kid, like when my parents would drag me out in the forest to go camping, I'd rather eat cyanide. I wanted to sit in front of the TV, watch TV, be inside. I didn't want to go out into nature. I didn't realize how pretty nature was until I'd take an acid. But when, if my parents had told me we're going to look for bigfoot, that would've gotten me out of the house in a second. It's a great way to go hiking. That's the bottom line. Squashing turns nature into a fun house and all the wood knocking and all the uh, the, the different Howell's that they do that sort of like, it makes it like a fun game.

Speaker 3:          00:13:37       The gifting stump, the gifting stuff. And also the other thing about those two that it showed me is how easy it is to start a religion. How easy it is to take a being that you really have no evidence for and begin to find evidence for it and things that naturally occur in nature. If you can't find a big foot, if you can't find real evidence of big foot, you know what you can do. You can attribute a feather in the path to big foot having left something there. If you can't find big foot, you know what you can do. You can say ravens are being sent by big foot to watch you in the forest. There's so many things that happen naturally. The sound of birds, the sound of something falling out of a tree that sounds like a knock. Branches that have fallen together in some certain way. I hear it all right now. Yeah, it's, it's easy and that's the exact same thing that religious people do with God. They've got this nonexistent being that they have no evidence for. A volcano explodes. God is angry. The rain doesn't come. That's God. The rain comes. We've been blessed by God. You know what? One of the 200 told me what this is essentially verbatim. He said, I was out near this blackberry Bush and I started hearing this bull and I

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       was like, what is a bull frog doing near a blackberry Bush? And I thought about it. Lane Alley. You know what? I bet that was a Sasquatch. Exactly. Exactly. A bull frog. He said it to my face. Yeah, like, like not like he was testing me, you know, he wasn't, he wasn't being silly. He wasn't pranking me. No, he wasn't seeing how far he could take it. He actually said it to my face. That's amazing. And it's incredible when you realize that priests are scratching for God. Amazing. They are a squash and forgot and there's even less evidence. Oh yeah. Less evidence for God and there is for big foot at least they have like gigantic Pythagoras bones as if they had God's big toe in a factory somewhere or in a, in a museum somewhere in the Vatican. A giant mystical toenail. A giant God, big toe. And God for sure there was a god that lived as recently as a hundred thousand years ago. Yeah. Wow. Big Foot is more realistic and religion. Yeah. There should be building cathedrals to big foot. I'd go to that church. I go to the Church of the squatch and a second. Yeah, it's all just would dock in and how Olin,

Speaker 1:          00:16:12       that was one thing that bobcat Goldthwait film got right. The Howells, they're pretty bad ass. Yeah, no, that was really cool man. And I don't want to give away the ending, but that was really cool, man. Yeah, that last little part, it was pretty bad ass. I had to press pause a few times, so that was so cool. I love the fact that Bobcat Goldthwait is such a big foot nut. Look, that's a, that's another interesting thing about big foot man. It is a black hole.

Speaker 3:          00:16:35       It's a slippery slope. Big Foot has gravity because once you open yourself up to the small potentiality a big foot, you'll find your mind wandering their weird parts of the day. Just like

Speaker 1:          00:16:46       fuck. And it's also like gambling where you go to a slot machine and you think, man, one more quarter could do it. I know I'm down 1000 bucks, but one more quarter and I could hit the jackpot this next squatch and chip. Look, I know I'm getting divorced and I know I'm in debt, but this one last squatch and trip, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna sell some stocks and I'm going to go out there and I'm going to just put it all on the line. A two weeks squash and trip. I'm going to get to the bottom of this,

Speaker 3:          00:17:14       change the world. And also man, I'll tell you, there is a, what's it called? There's animistic religions that believe that a spirit exists in every living thing. So trees have their own spirit, leaves have their own spirit. This is like a, a very old way of looking at nature is to see the thing is a living being instead of just biology happening to see it as one giant non-differentiated living being. And so there's always been embodiments of the forest. If you look at mythology, you have pan, you have the Jack and the Jack of the woods, which is this being that lives out in the and as an embodiment of nature. Well, maybe that's what big foot is. Maybe there's something built into the human psyche that we, when we get out in nature, we project some thing out into the woods, some human personification of the wildness of life, the wildness of nature. Something that maybe we lost a long time ago, and that's what big foot is. It's just this thing that human beings long for their reminds us of the time when we did you still live in the forest? We used to be big foot. That's what's wild about it. We used to be this thing existing in nature, depending on foraging and finding fish in the streams. That was us. So maybe that's what people see when they're looking for bigfoot. They see what we used to be.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       That's a great point because when you're out there in the woods, like the Pacific northwest, it's so just lush and rich and filled with wildlife. You start thinking, could I exist out here? If I was separate from society and civilization and grocery stores and automobiles and gas stations, could I keep my body alive out here? And I'm not sure if I could, you know I've, I've watched that show survivor man where he goes out into the woods and that guy is an expert survivalists and he scratches buy for five or six days before they eventually rescue him. Yep. And if, if it wasn't for those rescue people, eventually he would starve to death and he's an expert survivalist just, and he's got tools. He's got like a pocket knife usually or something that he can find and share it together. If you're by yourself naked, like big foot

Speaker 3:          00:19:26       or think about your French bulldog, imagine taking your French bulldog and dropping your French bulldog off in the middle of the Adirondacks. How long would that French bulldog survive without its wet food and it's chew toys maybe, maybe two hours before that thing gets sucked up like a sandwich at a carnival, that thing would be dead in a second. And that used to be a wolf. If you trace that genie, the gene line of the French bulldog all the way back, you get a wild wolf and nothing that can exist just fine out in nature is just find out there on the same way. That's what we are. We made a trade off, you know, we lost our fur, we lost the having tough feet and tough hands and being able to climb trees. That's the big trade off so that we can sit and play x box and enjoy air conditioning. We lost it. It's true, but we used to be that we used to be big foot and I think there's a thing inside everybody that longs for that time.

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       If you trace big foot, if you trace like the early hominids and you go all the way forward to some fat kid on Prozac sitting on the couch playing call of duty. Yeah, that, that's the same as a French bulldog. Yeah. If you could show a wolf, this is what you're going to become

Speaker 3:          00:20:43       something they can barely breathe. Breathe. It's so far. It's all the time lies on its belly and just fart. What's a walking whoopee cushion. It just farts and can't breathe. Used to be a wolf roaming the wild. Yeah. Now it's not protecting your house. It's not doing anything. Now it's barely able to stay alive, barely. And you have to feed it and pick it up. Pick it up to put it on the couch. I want one man. I've been looking for, I want a squatch, a mini squat, you know a big one. I mean, I just having a squash in your backyard. Nobody would ever try to break in your house except the squatch. Yeah, we just feed them. That would be an, I would not, you would do that by the way. You would do that. You've got like a pack of deadly pimples.

Speaker 3:          00:21:31       I remember when you bought all those dogs and I ain't going to, your house is terrifying and you've got to play it cool. Like you're not scared of your giant death hounds. My dog is a nice, I don't have those dogs anymore. Well, what happened? Didn't they all eat each other? Well, she fights. Shit went wrong. They ate each other. One killed a couple of them killed, one of the other one killed a couple of cats. Man, that was terrifying going to your house, man. That was scary. When you got those dogs, there's mastiffs, those deadly, massive, massive suite. He's not worry. You don't have to worry about the master. If it's the pit bulls, no Mascara. You don't have to worry about the pit bulls or the massive, but if you get two stone dogs can tell that you're, it's true, man. I went to my friend's house recently and I'd eaten a little piece of this chocolate bar.

Speaker 3:          00:22:26       I went to Johnny Pemberton's house and I was like still stone and paranoid and I went to his house and I walked in. He's got just a puppy and I walk in. I'm so paranoid that puppy looks at me. He's like, cause I'm scared as and sheer sweating. You have like a layer of sweat slime, losing a few like a fish. It's just shitting your pants and fear of a puppy. I've got that southern lawyer, armpits today deal, Tia and then, yeah, nothing that only amplifies the paranoid. I have a puppy that hates you because now you're like, what's it see inside of me, I'm going to see that sees the darkness that knows it, knows him a piece of shit and it starts here. Your, you know, your self critical parts to start analyzing your own life. And I'm like, man, it's knows I gotta pay my gates or knows I suck. Knows about my tax problem off in a massage parlor. The dog doesn't like it. Hates it. And then dude, that is fine with a puppy. But when you've got a drop in a massage parlor, yeah, that's fine. The dog sees no problem with that. It's a human issue, right? Yeah. Anybody can pet a dog and jerk

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       it off and they don't. They don't care. The dog would like it. Yeah. If you can pet a dog, he'll let you jerk him off. Dogs are notorious sluts. Oh, there's entire, hold on a second.

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       What are you doing man? Do you know what you're doing here? Do you know what show you're on? We just missed this shit would have been precious, man. This would have been prime time jerking off dogs, son of a bitch. You ruined everything. Talking about jerking off dogs, something unusable completely. Okay. Okay. Um, let's just wrap this up. The, the squashing was very fun. The I, the idea behind it is very interesting and uh, I, I remain open. I give myself a tiny window of possibility. I may be a 10% possibility that there's a Sasquatch really alive out there. But as far as my hope, my hopes and dreams, it's 100% of my hopes have 100% hope and dreams. I mean, it's not something that I've abandoned, but the reality of the situations bleak.

Speaker 3:          00:24:48       I think it's a bleak situation, but I don't think it's as bleak as I thought it was when I first went into it. And that's to me, very exciting.

Speaker 1:          00:24:56       What made you change your mind at all? What made you expand the possibilities? Meldrum

Speaker 3:          00:25:00       yeah, talking to Meldrum because when he started explaining, uh, the footage that you hate, but he started explaining why the thing would walk like that. And then when he started explaining how these footprints are very detailed and then um, when I put that together with the information that we found that there are these little people that used to exist. And then the thing with this ground ground parrot that just showed up out of the blue and all the new creatures that show up out of the blue from time to time, I just realized that it was very prideful of me to just bugle out there, no big foot. I realized that for me to say that was as unscientific as it was for me to say that there is a big foot. So I live in the mystery. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:46       Live in the mystery Dunkin Trust. Yeah. Live in the ministry. I think they're going to wrap it up. Aliens does an alien. The Sky above us. Yeah. Is Mexican without a green card. That is weird. They fly over. I Dunno. Huh? Why don't Mexicans Flyover? Don't have plans. No, but it seems like he's like, you could get one is easy if you get like one of those buses maybe. But I think they monitor airspace pretty, pretty closely. All right. Yeah. You don't want to get shot out of the sky by the federal A's. It's weird. That's fucking tunnels, man. Yeah. It's interesting that we call people from other countries aliens too. Yes. You know they're illegal aliens. There's outer space aliens and then there's,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       but everyone who's not like your country neighbor is an alien. Yeah, that's right. Canadians are aliens. Yeah. It's so stupid because they're humans. Like we act as though there's some different being all together. That's an old idea. You know that if someone isn't from your country, they might not even be human. They just look human. Well, the, as the idea of calling them aliens or alien to this area, like an alien species, it's been dropped into a lake, like the snakehead fish. That's been devastating. These freshwater lakes because yeah. It's like so hardy and eats everything and destroys everything. Yeah. Kind of like what the white people did in North America. We're aliens. Yeah. We're the aliens, but the American Indians were aliens as well. Native Americans came from Asia. Yeah. And the people in Asia came from Africa and the people in Africa came from Maki monkeys and the monkeys came from single celled organisms.

Speaker 3:          00:27:41       Yeah. Which came from bacteria steroid that smashed into the earth. So we are aliens. Everyone's an alien. Yeah. Well if you follow that logic, yeah. Every single living thing is alien. Because if that's, if panspermia that theory of amino acids and the building blocks of life existing and asteroids and then landing and earth after they slam into another plan. Yeah, it's really interesting. It's like a game of life leap frog all throughout the galaxy, all the way back to the big bang. You don't even need the media or smashing. I mean the earth is alien. The earth came from some interstellar dust that congealed at some point. It's, it all goes back to some flash of light. So billions of miles away, billions of miles away. So yeah, we are aliens now. The way that our spaceship works might be different from the white space. Ships work on Star Trek, the way our spaceship works as it grows food and it grows people.

Speaker 3:          00:28:36       That's our space. And we, the space ship itself produces the life form. But to, oh, sorry, go ahead. Well to, but to look at the wild insanity of where we came from and then to be like, oh no, no, no, there's no aliens. Couldn't be not nothing out there. That's madness. If life emerged from the congealed dust particulates that came from the explosion of stars and the spinning, the centrifuge action of this ball like thing was able to spit eventually to spit pinkies and brownies out of the thing, then God, people, there are many colors of people. But to think that just that if our planet is able to produce life just from spinning really fast around a star, to think that this isn't happening in other parts of an infinite universe is madness. And then the real mind fuck is the idea that our planet spawns this intelligent creature that's insanely curious and eventually starts playing with nuclear and then anti

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       matter and then figures out how to make a big bang machine. And then one day one of them just goes, fuck it. I'll press it. And he hits a button and boom, the whole universe implodes back down into the size of the head of a pin and explodes out again in a totally new big bang every 14 15 billion years or so.

Speaker 3:          00:30:01       Yeah, and this is not that idea. That idea is written about in the couponing shots and the Vedas. This is something they write about it. They say that Brahmin, it's a compared to an inhalation and an exhalation that the universe is a breathing thing and that sometimes the universe expands itself in this infinite outward breath and in that outward breath all created beings form which are a differentiation of this unit if field of consciousness and then there's the inbreath where everything comes back in and forms back to that head of the pen that science has. The Big Bang is of course, you know there are is new ideas about that. The whole head of the pan idea, the condensed super particle that they say created the big bang. A lot of people wonder if that's the case or if maybe a, the big bang is the effect of one universe brushing up against a universe. And poking into it and creating, uh, the outreach of matter. That is the big bang. We really don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:31:02       Yeah, that's a fascinating one. The idea that there's parallel universes like bubble baths that like, you know, the little circles in a bubble bath but there infinite and each one of them is its own self contained universe and they collide and they're just millimeters from each other, millimeters from the other university. Then they, Ooh, they collide and that's her creates all the energy.

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       Yeah. That's what it is, is just an endless transfer of energy from universe to universe. Yeah. That's, that's what it is. Just this giant living cluster of bubbles,

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       pea brains, the idea of the universe itself being semi infant or infinite or, or, or fractal, the idea of there being infinite amount of infinite universes. It's just, it's, it's too hard to wrap our heads around the fact that well, it all also might be breathing. It might be going out, expanding and then contracting. Yeah. For Infinity.

Speaker 3:          00:32:01       Yeah. And that thing that you were talking about, the, the way that we explore, the way that we have this desire to understand and to investigate and examine did. That's the original impulse. It's just that impulse is being channeled through our particular neurology's, but that impulse is in all living things. That desire to experience and to explore and to learn that this is this giant massive bubble cluster of intelligence is God trying to understand what the fuck is happening because everybody acts like God knows everything already. Just think so. If it's God, it knows everything. Why? Maybe it's just like us only a trillion billion to the trillion squared, a times more aware and even that much more confused.

Speaker 1:          00:32:49       Well, how about one grader? How about whence intelligent life eventually reaches a point where it can control all matter and has access to all the knowledge in the universe itself. Maybe it becomes God and maybe that's what God is in the first place. And maybe this coalescence, this sin synergistic thing that's happening right now with humans and technology is because technology is the only way we can ask you actually become God biologically, is that we have to figure out a way to manipulate matter to the point where we take what we call consciousness and put it into something that can develop infinitely faster than our simple biology can. And that that in turn becomes a universal consciousness. And that that is the origins of the universal consciousness is not just that we share space and that we share this morphic field, but in fact that all of our minds will eventually join as one super mind. And that super mind will be the very creator of the universe that has spawned us itself.

Speaker 3:          00:33:50       Yes. And that will be some 14 year old squid alien playing a super advanced x box

Speaker 1:          00:33:56       going off on top of a windmill.

Speaker 3:          00:33:57       Yeah. And that's all folks. No, man, I, I that, that um, that idea is really cool. This is an idea Alan Watts talks about when he says, imagine if you could experience everything like imagine if you were some kind of godlike being in anything that you could think. You can instantly create anything you want to do, experience. You could instantly experience. If you wanted to know what it was like to be everything, you could feel that if you wanted to know what it was like to be an alien flying through space, exploring space, you could be that, but eventually, eventually Alan Watts says, you would get so bored of being able to do anything you wanted to do, that you would be like, hm, I wonder what it's like to not know that I can do everything. I wonder what it's like to think I'm going to die and be completely limited.

Speaker 3:          00:34:46       And then that's when he turned into a human being and that's when you get it because of the experience. Human life, we're like, Whoa, fuck, I'm going to die. You can't do anything, man. Oh God. And then when you die or when this event happens, where everything unifies them becomes one consciousness, that's when you wake up again. I'm like, wow, that was nuts. I thought I was going to die. I thought I was limited. I thought I was an individual. I thought I was singular. As it turns out, I'm everything and the whole cycle starts over again.

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       What I found fascinating in researching aliens and in, in doing the show is the different attitudes about what aliens would be interested in and what aliens wouldn't be interested in. I, the guy I talked to from Seti, he seemed to believe that they wouldn't even care about the fact that we have nuclear power. Like why would the aliens hover over nuclear power and other people think that that would the number one

Speaker 4:          00:35:37       thing they would concentrate on and then other people think the, well they had, they would have access to stop all that stuff. They can control all the power and they are essentially waiting for us. This is like the most utopian concept. Yeah. They're waiting for us to graduate. So a our society and civilization stops being this fear mongering warlike culture and we graduate to this next level of spiritual evolution and join the Galactic Federation that we become worthy. And then they're sitting there waiting for us to graduate from

Speaker 3:          00:36:10       high school. Oh, I love that. That's really cool man. Like, like they're gardeners, you know, they're like planetary gardeners and that human species is a form of biomass that they like to cultivate. And sometimes the garden grows, sometimes it doesn't grow, but it's some point, the thing inevitably gets to a place where it's about to blossom and that's when it's at its most fragile point in time, that place where it's about to grow the flowers of the singularity or the flowers of some super advanced technology. And when that happens, that's the joining of the Galactic Federation that they is a new age crystal. People talk about, I think that's a beautiful idea. I think it's a beautiful idea and I think that I, I don't see why not. I mean we grow flowers, we, we cultivate the earth, we breed animals. Why wouldn't some super advanced intelligence take the light and turning monkeys into flying teleporting super technological beings. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:37:11       And W we also have this thing where we want results like right away. You know, we want things to happen right now. Why don't the aliens land now? Why don't people get it together right away? Why do we have to continue our, our, our primitive ways and our primitive culture? But if you thought about it from the standpoint of an infinite being, the why would the infinite being want to rush things as all the time in the world? Like why does it need the results right away. Exactly. And isn't there. This isn't their joy in, in the the struggle and this isn't their joy in the whole process of becoming this, this symbiotic, this God creature. Yeah. He's in the joy in all of, it's slowly improving. Like you don't want to have sex in a 10th of a second, you know, a 10th of a second Sachs, right?

Speaker 4:          00:38:02       You want to have sex for a long time so that you can enjoy it. You want your wife to feel good, you want to hold in your orgasm as long as you can for it to feel good. Yeah. And maybe that's sort of the same idea about the universe creating consciousness, is that the universe wanted us to slowly over the course of billions of years, go from sludge that wiggles to people that press buttons and rockets fly through the air with nuclear bombs on the end of them that literally splice Adams and destroy matter instantaneously leaving the area impossible to occupy for hundreds of thousands of years. But to the universe, what's a hundred thousand years? That's nothing. It's a joke.

Speaker 3:          00:38:43       Nothing. And this isn't, you know, in Hinduism they, when they talk about the gods that they all say like a day of Brahmin is like, you know, a million human years, like one day for this being as a million billion years. So a super advanced being, who knows how long the thing survives. It's a great way to look at it too. It's just interesting how humans tend to ascribe cumin characteristics to beings that emerged from ostensibly different galaxies or even other dementia. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:39:17       Or even the universe itself, the limitations of birth and death are applied to the very universe itself and really sorta arbitrarily just because of the fact that they have the signature from the big bang. That doesn't, doesn't mean it's not an infinite number of those that have been going on forever and there's no birth and death. It's just that breathing in and breathing out, but everybody talks about one day even our son will die. Yes. Will it really? You know it, it will create humans, man. Yeah. The only way you can make a human being as a star, as to explode where we are literally made out of carbon and carbon comes from stars and all the, the different matter, the, the different elements of matter that make up a human being. You literally have to have a star that blows up. So the idea that our stars going to die. No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Our star is going to blow out human seed.

Speaker 3:          00:40:09       Yeah, there you go. Exactly. You know, our star is going to radically change and the same way that everything radically changes, which is why death itself is a silly word. You know when people say die, really what they mean is the person, the being, whatever it is, has transformed into something completely different than what it was before and that, I mean, I know there's a biological principle, died, death. They say it's when we stop breathing or that when we stop [inaudible] when we, when we stop breathing and your dad, but the reality is when you start breathing, really what's happening is you are transforming into energy for all the tiny little microbes living inside of your intestines that are gradually going to turn you into soil that's grown up, going to grow food for other people to eat.

Speaker 4:          00:40:58       You're not the not, we have a dual, the Dunkin, we're going to formaldehyde people to preserve them and they would code them with a stick skin of makeup. It's very lifelike and realistic with a tow of subtle wax like quality to grandma's face.

Speaker 3:          00:41:13       Isn't that hilarious? I was just thinking about that, like how funny it is that we put people in coffins, which are essentially supposed to be beds so that people can like rock comfortably and some kind of like big underground couch. You know, how much space we could save in graveyards if we have the guts to chop people up and put them into little bags. We don't do that. Well how about put them into the ground and have them do what they're supposed to do in the first place. You know why we can't do that? Because we want to be able to dig them up and charge people with murder. Yeah, exactly, man. That's right. And also if we did that, there would be a swarm of goth kids descending on every grave yard just to try to dig a skull outs. They didn't have to bother with pop in a coffin open.

Speaker 3:          00:41:53       But it is weird that we don't like think of the shape of a coffin. Right, right. We don't put, if you wanted to save space in a cemetery and you could dig a hole deep where you could drop the coffin down, like they're standing up and you want them to relax, we want him to relax in a nice bed. I just saw this ad, uh, this old vintage ad for, um, uh, a type of vault. It's like, it's an old drawing of a woman who's standing by the window looking out at the rain and it's like, don't you feel comfortable knowing that your loved one is safe from the weather and evolve that like, oh, let water in there. But that's it. That's been going on forever. And that's what pyramids are there. Just elaborate ridiculous mechanisms to try to preserve the human body sort of then a mom know what the hell pyramids are for. Well, they modification process. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:42:43       sure. Yeah, that's, that's a fascinating Todd. You know, you're not on camera, right? How dare you. Um, this skin Walker ranch thing, we're going to go and we're going to, there's, there's a place in Utah, it's called Skin Walker ranch and this place, it's legendary in the, in, in the the big foot folk. Yeah. Talk. Yeah. The, the people that are fascinated with big foot say that this is the spot where there's all these different things being worked on, that there's wormholes there and space ships are coming from wormholes. So I go to their website, right. I'm thinking it's probably just a regular ranch. Everybody's just being nutty. It's beans. They have a link on the website that says the entities, what says classifying creatures at skin Walker ranch out at work. So I'm like, okay, now you got me. What is that? So I click on that and it takes me to all the various types of entities that have been reported.

Speaker 4:          00:43:48       Oh yeah. And it is simple as the spotlight and flashed drones, a pulsating spherical ball of light, which could easily be ball lightning. Seems like these are like reasonable sort of either a mythical explanations of natural phenomenon or just legend. So as we go further and further though, it gets to weird ones like the bulletproof wolf. Ah, yeah. It says the dire wolf, like creature as long dirty mangy gray black hair has a proud, intimidating and intense like presence. At this time, I am unsure if it is hostile or friendly. My impression was neither more majestic and to be in nature. Wait a minute, is this, this is on the Internet. Yeah. My impression was neither that you're supposed to have a comma dummy. If you're gonna talk about fucking, if you're talking to folks at medical group wolves, you don't have to use appropriate grammar. May travel within the flash drones and manifest from them as seen by two researchers. Oh, as seen by two researchers should be legit. A bulletproof wolf that comes out of a flash drought. Well, two guys saw and Dunkin.

Speaker 3:          00:44:59       Well, I mean it sounds like these people are just going around with a microphone and recording. People snorted bass.

Speaker 4:          00:45:06       Here's one of them. The controllers would, sounds like two adult males speaking to one another in an unknown language. These two males are typically invisible and usually overhead. Overheard speaking about 20 feet above one's head. They are speaking in a native American like dialect. By the way, that's also where they attribute to big foot. Yeah. It's always like a native American native American is the way to go. If you want to go spiritual and woo woo and you know, you know, if you want to share, we want to talk to the spirits of the sky in this space and we are in touch with the spirits of the great guardians of the universe. So it's like a native American.

Speaker 3:          00:45:45       But it is funny that they're saying that these beings talking to dialect, which means that they're not talking in their native language when they're hovering above you, they're talking and I, and a language you understand.

Speaker 4:          00:45:54       Well not only that, it means that there so intelligent, so advancing, get here from other planets, but they haven't figured out how to talk without language yet. They haven't figured out how to direct communicate mind to mind.

Speaker 3:          00:46:04       Well, I don't think skin Walker ranch is all about aliens. I think it's just about a lot of paranormal activity that happens. And this guy talked to you and Austin, Dr. Eric Davis used to work there and this guy, uh, though I would say that he's eccentric. He did a few things. Uh, when I went to visit him, that made me think, oh, I don't, I don't think that this guy's a Kook. When, and what he did specifically was, um, he has his laboratory where they're doing all these various experiments. This is a guy who actually trying to create a warp drive. He's trying to create a way using vacuum technology to bend space and time that creates kind of like a wave effect that his ship could ride on a crest of somehow going faster than the speed of light. Um, so what, when we went to visit this guy, he did two things that made me, do you think, wow, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:46:54       I don't know if how skeptical I should be about this guy, which is the ad is all these experiments running in this laboratory. One of them being, they're trying to discover a way to do cold fusion, you know, which is what somehow um, creating an infinite energy source, which is a, what he calls a disruptive technology or disrupt human society. If we had an infinite energy source. But what he did was he kept pointing to his experiments and saying, this isn't working. Nothing's happening here. This cold fusion isn't working. And all of his experiments, he was like saying we're all getting no results from these experiments, which me is the opposite of what all the other Kooks that we've encountered on the show. Do people you like whoever designed this website, you, you could probably call this person up and say you saw an skin walker ranch at tap dancing clown.

Speaker 3:          00:47:42       They can shoot lightning bolts out of his hands that turned into pineapples and that would show up on the website and four minutes probably. Probably. Probably. Cause that researcher has discovered this. No Sir. We should try that. Yeah, you could get it up there. We should see how many we can get on there before the guy starts catching on. It's a giant, but literal holes through the hills. You have to watch for it in your face. Yeah, it's it. Yeah. But it's farts have a native American dialect, a native American quality, the smell like hickory, hickory wood chips. Um, but this Dr. Eric Davis, he worked on skin Walker ranch because skin walker ranch is a place that was bought by this eccentric guy named Robert Bigelow who's currently working with NASA. He's uh, develop some kind of inflatable technology where you can add, uh, add onto the space station using like essentially like super powerful bouncy houses.

Speaker 3:          00:48:41       You know what I mean? Like you like bill using metal and space, getting metal in space, getting construction material in this space are using terrestrial construction methods in space is not only highly inefficient, it's incredibly dangerous. You have to go into, to spend whatever amount of time it would take to actually build things using aluminum or metal. It's dangerous. So this guy came up with a brilliant idea of having packaged inflatable a crafts that you can bring in to space, uh, and the material that they're made of is a much more powerful and can, uh, take the damage of micro media rights a lot better than metal according to Dr. Eric Davis since that's what Bigelow, that's one of the things he's working on right now. In other words, he's not just a a Kook. He's actually got satellites floating in space right now that he got up there.

Speaker 3:          00:49:29       So he heard about the skin walker ranch, heard about all the paranormal activity that was happening there and decided that he would buy it since scientists there to study it, to find out if he could find any proof of this insane stuff that so many people are reporting. And Dr. Eric Davis spent time there studying this stuff and he said, he told me to my face that he saw, uh, orbs floating out there, that he saw orbs floating out there that, uh, he couldn't think of any other explanation for. I asked them about the cattle mutilations. He said, no, that's, he thinks they think that's people doing that. They don't think it's aliens. He said that some of the researchers, they reported seeing like wormholes opening up and I this guy, like I believed him. Like he, he actually gets contracts from the government to work on this stuff and it doesn't serve any purpose to go on a TV and talk about wormholes opening up when he said like, I uh, these researchers reported some kind of creature emerging from this wormhole.

Speaker 3:          00:50:35       I mean, I don't understand what you have to gain as a scientist by saying things that sound like they're coming from the freakout tent at burning man. It, you know, there's nothing to gain. What do you have to gain if you're actually trying to get, trying to get business as a scientist. So it, when I asked him this, uh, one of the really smartest things he said is that as a scientist, that's your job. You report your observations. You have to say what you've seen. And sometimes reporting your observations means that people are going to try to discredit you. People are going to say, you're crazy. People are going to, uh, you're going to lose a lot of face and um, I dunno, I believed him.

Speaker 4:          00:51:16       There's also the reality to consider the, there's a lot of people that tend to lean towards the fantastic, they tend to lean towards fantasy and they want there to be something magic out there and their regular life is boring man. They're, the wife doesn't want to have sex with them. Their dog doesn't care. There's nothing going on. I don't really go outside if the dog, the guy is there or not, you know what I mean? Cause like a lot of people that don't have anything exciting. That's my point. My point is that there's a lot of people in this world that they have no joy. There's nothing exciting about their occupation. Sure. It's nothing exciting about their marriage. There's nothing exciting about their neighborhood. They long for something special. And I think a lot of that goes back to our hunter gatherer routes where every day was filled with peril and excitement.

Speaker 4:          00:52:04       And even though there was a lot of loss of life and people didn't last as long, it was still a lot of thrill. You know, people starved to death. But you know what, sometimes they didn't and you've got an elk and everybody ate and they got by the fire and you found mushrooms and everyone took them and there was joy and excitement and it was a real, it was a special existence. We've, in making everything so safe, we've Kinda like smooth all the rough spots that could trip you up in this life. We've also cut out all the fun, you know, we've, we've cut out all the excitement, we've cut all the worry about getting eaten by a Jaguar. The worst thing you have to worry about as another idiot human slamming and you have with their stupid car. That's what Jeff to worry about. And eventually we'll figure that out too. We'll have some magnetic field around each car. So they repel each other like magnets when you get close and they just bounce off of each other. That's on the way, I guarantee you that's on the way.

Speaker 3:          00:53:00       Yeah, sure. I mean, I think that there are a group of people who just get super bored and make up stories. Kids do it.

Speaker 4:          00:53:06       Why wouldn't they make up stories? But they lean towards the fantastic say there's an infinite amount of possibilities to explain any particular scenario they're experiencing. They lean towards the most fantastic of those possibilities. And then they nurture that and then they also surround themselves with other people who likeminded and then they develop this sort of hive mind of bullshit. And they all sit around jerking each other off, pretending they're being abducted by aliens. Oh, he's touching my bud abducting me. Yeah, that's crazy. I'm touching your butt.

Speaker 3:          00:53:40       I agree, man. I think you're right. I think there are clusters of psychos out there and it's easy to find it. So many examples of that and I think kids tend to do, I can remember and I as a kid going into the house and telling my mom that I'd seen wonder woman, no reason to tell her that I hadn't seen wonder woman. I just like, but I started lying to my mom. I'm like, yeah, I saw wonder woman by how old were you? I as 17 no, no. I was young, man. I was like, you know, six maybe I don't, I don't know. I was young, but I can remember telling this blatant lie to my mom, my mom being like, are you sure you sound wonder woman? And then I started in my mind, I started like imagining the encounter to help the lie.

Speaker 3:          00:54:32       I could like kind of imagine the wonder woman coming up to the plate, to the, to the swing and like saying hi. I could kind of see you're standing there and I, instead of being like, you know, you're right, mom, I'm lying. I just went deeper and deeper end of the lie. That's the problem with people. It happens. But I guess when I hear that someone has taken the time to figure out a way to construct inflatable space habitats and has even managed to get those into orbit and these, and this is a person who has bought a ranch where other scientists who are our reporting activity. When I hear that stuff, I, it makes me believe it a little bit more than when I hear somebody who's just a crystal gazer yapping about this stuff. When I hear that stuff and when I hear it, skin Walker ranch, you can't get in there.

Speaker 3:          00:55:23       When I hear that they have really high security and that, you know, there's reports of like government cars going in there and stuff. Then to me, I start thinking, well, something must be going on there. I don't understand why a guy is getting million dollar contracts from NASA suddenly decides to buy a ranch and put a security perimeter fence around it where people can't get into and then become secretive about this stuff that's happening in there. Why if you're some line Kook who just wants people to believe in aliens, why wouldn't you just send reports all the time? That website you're looking at, that's not Bigelow's website. That's somebody who thinks he's an expert on skin Walker ranch. That's not Bigelow. That's somebody completely different.

Speaker 4:          00:56:02       Oh, I see what you're saying. Well, just to play devil's advocate about Bigelow, let's just assume that he's working on top secret spacecrafts that there. Sure. Why wouldn't he have high level security? Well, you don't want people wandering up. Hey Man, what's your Weldon? Yeah, why you putting together a stealth bomber?

Speaker 3:          00:56:19       Right. Well, well it's not just that it's that he bought a ranch that prior to his ownership that people who live there, we're reporting on this seven, their cattle were getting like regularly like Moodle and mutilated. So there's some odds and not only that, but he invited, you know, scientists there to actually study this stuff. I will tell you the part that makes me skeptical about it is a every encounter that Dr. Eric Davis reported, somehow the cameras didn't work. He said that he saw these floating lights and it was filmed on security camera footage. I asked him where the footage was. He said, it's in some warehouse there and Bigelow doesn't want to release it. You know, it's a classic thing, which is you, the you, the person can report these experiences. But you would think that scientists that were sent to a place to investigate it would have the wherewithal to videotape this stuff. And he said, especially with this wormhole that he reported where some being climbed out, he said that uh, the, the energy that gets released from this massive up cameras and of course the moment you start hearing that stuff slide right back down into the skeptic swamp because it, it does seem a little curious that a, they don't have any footage that I know of. There might be footage, there might be footage from skin Walker ranch, but I'm not aware of it.

Speaker 4:          00:57:38       Well, it's sort of akin to how they think that big foot consents, camera traps. Yes. And that's where we're getting to with the show. Unfortunately there it's more of a show in psychology than it is on anything else. Yeah. As time goes on you realize that it's more about how you sort of interpret what you view in the world than it is about what you're actually saying.

Speaker 3:          00:58:00       But look at the Phoenix Lights, look at that. What is that man? That's some massive craft that went flying over county after county. Uh, governor reported seeing it. Come on man. What is that? That's not some kid talking about wonder woman. That's lots and lots of people reporting the this thing.

Speaker 4:          00:58:20       Okay, stop what you said there because there is evidence, video evidence in Phoenix Lights, right? Okay. But what is the video evidence? It's just these things floating in the sky is red lights floating in the sky. It's like very simple. Sean descript. Not that spectacular. You can wash the Phoenix lights is that they've shown it on national news broadcasts and it's kind of nothing. So all this other stuff is all stuff that really wasn't captured on camera. So it all falls into the same category when you go. What about the Phoenix Lights? The governor saw it. Everyone that you can get all sensational with it. But then when you go, okay, where is the evidence? And you go, well, will they have a video? And then you watched the video of the Phoenix Lights. You go man, I mean, what is that? That ain't shit. Let's pull up the fee.

Speaker 4:          00:59:02       Can you pull it up, pull up the video of the Phoenix Lights, find the video of the Phoenix Lights. Let's just look at it because it's stock footage. Anyone can can look at it. We'll pull it up because it's something to behold because a, it's it. It's, it's a huge point of discussion in a Ufo Lore. If you, if you talk to people about there's Roswell and the Phoenix Lights. Yeah, those are the two big ones. Yeah. But it is amazing when you actually watch the Phoenix lights, how non sensational it is, how almost boring and nothing and indescript it's just these floating light bulbs.

Speaker 3:          00:59:43       Well, yeah, but I mean, I think it, to me the, I mean, I don't know, it's to me what, what your care is to me, what, but it does seem like it

Speaker 4:          00:59:50       could have been drones, could have been a lot of things. Let's watch it. Okay. This is the actual Phoenix lights and this is the stuff that people talk about. Like, oh my goodness, the UFO is are here. We'll look at what we're actually seeing. You actually seen some lights floating above Phoenix. Yes. That's kind of interesting, but you know, it's not that interesting man. I mean there's some lights floating about Phoenix,

Speaker 3:          01:00:17       but those lights are connected. I mean the idea is those lights are connected to one crack.

Speaker 4:          01:00:20       No, that's not the idea. No, they are. They see, cause you see them, there's this, there's a bunch of them. The idea is that there are several different things going on. Did these, these things floating and it, there's also this triangular thing that's floating in the air, but what you're seeing here is these things that are floating in the sky and a new one keeps lighting up. My memory. That is weird. It is definitely weird, but it's not something that human couldn't do if we had drones. I mean they keep popping up and new light keeps popping up,

Speaker 3:          01:00:50       man. Why? If somebody is doing that as a hugs, why didn't they keep doing it? That's something crazy up there, man.

Speaker 4:          01:00:55       It might not be a hoax it, we might be experimented with a new technology and it wasn't far enough away to be out of the view of the people. It might be experimenting with a psychology study to see what would happen if you have these uh, non fon lights flying over a major metropolitan city and in clear view of everyone who lives there, what's the reaction? How do people, how do people react to this? What's the fallout?

Speaker 3:          01:01:26       That's it. But I've seen videos of drones going up in the air and they, they, they, Bob, those things aren't bobbing right, but what are they doing? They're just sitting there. They're sitting there, which is even more bizarre. I mean it, yeah, like how do you, how do you do that? Imagine the wind up that high with something that big to have stabilizers that make it stay completely immobile. Floating there in the sky. If those were drones they would, there were be movement that things connected and the size of that thing is tremendous. Whatever that thing is is very, very, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:01:59       it's moved up and down. Those lights have moved up and down to me. Like they're individually moving. It looks like they're all connected to one craft. If you go back to the beginning though, the way they are, that's not in like one line. In fact they're stacked on top of each other a little bit. Jamie ticket back to the, to the very beginning if you would, if you look at it very early on when you start to see these lights, they're not simply, they're not simply all along like a straight line. Like one of them was above the other one. Seems like there's two on the right hand side. Yeah. That's that safe. See that? A bunch of them together. See all that. Yeah, that's a curve. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it's like somebody released a cluster of these drones and then they fly out with these lights on them and they stabilize. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:49       I think it's, look, I just from my UN scientific perspective, that is those aren't drones. I mean you can look up a video of drones like flying at night floating and look at what that looks like. You should compare it to that because I've seen this video of what drones are

Speaker 4:          01:03:04       balloons or a blimp, but drones can take on a million different forms. I mean the idea that, you know, the word drone is like the word drug. I mean, it could be a, could have a lot of different applications to be a lot of different things.

Speaker 3:          01:03:19       Well, look, here's the, here's the bottom line. It's more likely that that's a terrestrial craft, right? Then it's a non-terrestrial crap. Right? That's true. You can't argue with that. It's more likely that that's something that the government created or someone doing a hoax, but the reports of that thing and the distance that it traveled and the consistency of the shape and the many reports, if that's a, if that's a hoax, it's an elaborate hoax. Whoever's doing the hugs could probably make a lot more money selling shit to the government than freaking out rednecks. Forgive me. I don't think everyone in Phoenix, Phoenix is not filled with hot. There you go. Nuts. They're next door. He returns to jam. It can, but they have air conditioning. You know, they're not savages. Yeah. But I know that if you have to walk out to your car, if you get sunstroke walking to your car, you start slowly, your brain fries a little bit.

Speaker 4:          01:04:10       Um, didn't have stuff happened in September, was relatively cool. What's that? Didn't this happen in September?

Speaker 3:          01:04:17       I don't know man. For the sake of what I'm saying. And he's happened in the middle of summer when there's a power shortage. Looking at, here's the, the, the, what I'm saying is whatever that is. It was novel and special and Super Bizarre. And what you're saying, which is I think the best point is, well, where, where's the footage from? Skin Walker ranch? Where's the footage? Where's Bigelow's footage? Where's footage of weird things happening there?

Speaker 4:          01:04:45       This though this Phoenix lights, if you keep watching this, those lights just slowly fade out. Which would sort of lend to the theory that these were actually just flares.

Speaker 3:          01:04:55       No, no, that's just one shot. Man, I think traveled several counties. There's videos of that thing all over fee. That's not an

Speaker 4:          01:05:01       just from one spot I think move. Okay. Let's see if he got an, uh, look for best version of Phoenix Lights. If you could find another one. Jamey. I think, um, I think it's, uh, it's something to think about. You know, the, the idea, something to think, the idea that that was some sort of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The decided to hover over Phoenix.

Speaker 3:          01:05:23       One thing that Eric Davis said, which is interesting, is that these beings, whatever they are, they're, they're gathering intelligence. They're trying to, they're observing us. For some reason. They don't feel like necessarily communicating with us. They're observing us. You know, maybe they fuck up from time to time. Maybe they screw up and, uh, something just crashes in Roswell or something appears in the night sky and nailing gets fired because he fell asleep at the wheel or whatever they have. Who knows?

Speaker 4:          01:05:53       Do you one better, maybe their idea is that if you're dealing with an incredibly intelligent human being population that has nuclear power, mass communications, the ability to send video and photographs through the air and, and instantaneously arrive across the globe. Maybe these beings need to be baby fucked. Maybe you need a slow Lee, show them about Ufo, a gentle, gentle, gentle, maybe you can't just just horse fuck. Maybe he can't just like land on the White House lawn and go eat, come on bitches. You're kind of with me. And Start Zapping people. Sure. Maybe have to slowly indoctrinate them into the idea

Speaker 4:          01:06:36       of the world of the extraterrestrial intelligent being coming here. And it's the way to do that is to space it out. The way to do that is to how something happened in Roswell, New Mexico. And I mean, again, if you're talking about some infinitely intelligent being Kurzweil's already talking about extending our life, that if you could live to 20, 45, you know, you're probably going to live forever. You're going to live to a thousand years, whatever you're dealing with a being that has already accepted that as a reality and it is planting a seed and it's slowly planting a seed here on earth and that allows those spacecraft to crash in a place where it knows there's going to be a military that's going to be really quiet about it. Sure. And that they allow, uh, these, these lights or they Cory GAF, these lights flying over Phoenix and landing.

Speaker 3:          01:07:24       Or maybe they know, maybe they look at it like contamination. You know, like when we send the Mars probe up to Mars and we try to keep it, we try to like keep it from all earth microbes to not contaminate Mars. Maybe they look at it showing and showing themselves to us as a form of psychic contamination. Maybe they don't want, maybe they don't even want us to know it all. I think it's more likely if there are these beings that they mess up just like any other being does from time to time. They just mess up. There's mistakes and the programs you workers. Yeah. Why not

Speaker 4:          01:07:54       this people they hire and they just do a shit job of intergalactic travel to like Shitty intergalactic Greyhound bus drivers. Yeah, exactly. Talk and look at the turnaround. This is another video of the Phoenix Lights. Look at how stable those lights are, man. Yeah, it is kind of interesting. You know, the idea of them being stable as interesting, but if we can split atoms with a bond that would drop out of a propeller plane, I don't think it's that, that impossible to create something that can hover in the sky like that and stay stable in a straight line

Speaker 3:          01:08:27       look. Of course, of course. Definitely. There's no proof that that we don't know where it came from. All we know is that a massive thing that seems to be a connection of lights on some form of craft appeared over Phoenix and it got caught on video by a lot of different people. We do know that. So what that thing is, who knows? Comes Razor says it's the government or it's some kind of military test or something like that. But you'd think of military test, there's plenty of space to do that shit where people don't see it.

Speaker 4:          01:08:59       Hmm. And here's another, let's throw this into the hat. If you were an extraterrestrial intelligent being and you were coming here from another planet to observe Earth, where would you go? Well, I would want to go to where this dude lives, where he's making inflatable bouncy houses for space. Yeah. I wanna I wanna check out that cat. I want to go and, and, and freak out. This dude who is got a billion ones and Zeros and is spending all of it on Ufo research and space travel research.

Speaker 3:          01:09:31       The problem with that is is he bought the ranch from just cattle farmers. So what sets up the activity was already happening there before he bought the ranch. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:09:40       How much of that is horse poop? How much that the, the, the activity before that? It's not true.

Speaker 3:          01:09:46       Well I, I don't know man. But you know, the difference between this and big foot is that we already have much more compelling footage than we had for big foot. I'm like just that. It's like what is that? And then of all the Ufo footage, let's say that 2% of it is like that, that's still pretty compelling. Cause remembering, I think it was in China or Japan, I think it was China, some giant craft started appearing. And I think there's footage of that too. This all seem to be happening at the same time where people said maybe the government's experimenting with some massive, uh, stealth craft.

Speaker 4:          01:10:21       And it's also interesting that as our technology is improving and our ability to record things is improving subsequently. Also, our ability to fake things is improving, right? And you could, you could fake it on a laptop. A personal laptop can make a very convincing video of some paranormal activity, whether it's a Ufo or a ghost, or

Speaker 3:          01:10:43       you know, name it well, and even what's, even if you experienced it yourself, even if you're standing in Phoenix and you look up and you see this thing go by, you're still just dealing with your optic nerve. You're still dealing with your limited human senses. The truth is you'll never know. You'll never know unless you got lucky enough to get abducted and sucked into one of these ships and saw for yourself. There's no way that you can know for certain what these things are. We just know that is phenomena

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       that happens. This is one of the things on the website, uh, the describes and skin Walker ranch website. The portal. It says, I have seen this firsthand, but I have possibly seen radiation from it made the entire night scenery appear like daytime for 10 seconds. Very bright flash of light, which illuminated both sky and the ground. First of all, if you write like that, I'm not listening to you. Okay? I have seen this firsthand, but I have possibly seen radiation from it. That's a sentence. Yeah. What the fuck does that mean? Dude, I have seen this firsthand, but I have possibly seen radiation firsthand. Yeah. What the fuck are you saying? Nothing. Are you saying I haven't seen this first hand or I have seen it says I have. Oh, it says, I have never seen this. I read it wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:12:09       So what? Where's the picture? Even if you did read her eye, where's there's no picture, there's no picture joking around about the whole thing, but because of buzz above that is sent to Tiant missed. Oh boy described by Bigelow researchers as a neurological electricity. That's unique. Entity is completely black and color takes the intangible for these motherfuckers watched lost too many times. It takes the intangible form of a thick smoke. The smoke is described like a disembodied skin of a black electrified energy that possesses and intellect theories hold that this is a pre transitional embodiment of a not yet formed entity as it emerges from a portal or flashed drone. Oh, excellent theory. I'm sure peer reviewed, I'm sure it's been peer reviewed. This shameless, malleable missed. We'll eventually mold itself into a local animal or humanoid. A really does read like the instruction guide for an Xbox game, like these are the things you're going to fight.

Speaker 1:          01:13:10       Exactly. That's a video game. I mean, come on, man. It the smoke is eventually get a mold itself into a local animal. It's going to be a squirrel sylo squirrels that you see that just like eating nuts and you go, hey Mr Squirrel, that's an alien man. He's spying on you from another planet and sending data to the NSA of outer space. Yeah. It's that website does not seem very Kratovil. Aw. What we need to do, man, is we need to go to skin Walker ranch ourselves. We need to go and bring some night vision equipment. Scan the skies, talk to the locals, see if it's hooey. Who knows, man. I mean it might be one of those things where we get there. We see a bunch of crazy shit. Yes, exactly. That's the only way you can know and never know. You never know and at least we'll have the experience that we could talk about and everyone watching can think that we're a too,

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       cause that's what happened. Yeah. That's the funny thing about it is we, if we go there and have some kind of experience and report it, even if we catch it on camera, there's still going to be selling me like, Nah, we're comedians. Yeah. What would they believe us? They will. Yeah, exactly. If you're not going to believe is scientists working on a warp drive or somebody who's creating inflatable craft for NASA, no one's going to believe to stoner comics when they report and seeing flashing lights. Dude, I swear we saw it. By the way. We have a new show coming out on PSI Phi. It's called Joe Rogan questions. Everything. Duncan Trussell in ours fear. What we're going to do is we're going to try to find mysteries and we found one. Yeah. Yeah. So what does music a real man, Jesus could come climbing out of a hole. It's skin Walker ranch and give us both hand jobs and, well, you know, it's probably just a hippie [inaudible] hippie.

Speaker 3:          01:15:08       I'm Jesus, a clever gay hippie that climbs out of squirrels asshole. And he appears as missed until he forms into Jesus. The classic Jesus Robes, hands outstretched. He Chan has a cock in God. Do you know how crazy that would be if Jesus came back and was really gay? Yeah. If Jesus came back and just all he wanted to do was give him jobs, he didn't say, we're amazing. Yeah, you would like, you were really skeptical. You're like, why would I let them jerk me off? Jesus. You're not going to say now if Jesus wants to give you a hand job, you're not saying no. We'd be like, he'd be like, listen, I'll tell you all about spirituality and enlightenment per first want to jerk you off. And when you're calm sprays out, it turns into babies immediately. No, it's rainbows. Oh yeah. Just sparkling rainbows. Smells the litter hours. As soon as you come, you're instantly as gay as Jesus. Yeah. Well, I mean how do you go back? It's hard. Yeah. When he jerks you off and it's way better than sex with a woman, you have a choice to make. It's not even a choice.

Speaker 3:          01:16:18       Oh, okay. We have maps of skin walker, ranch.org there's maps of where the most activity is taking place Dunkin, which is very important. You know what the problem with a website like that as once they've been talking about some mess that can congeal into an animal, then everything else becomes invalidated. It doesn't it. It feels like whatever. This website is not the right place to go to. Well, if you ever seen how big skin Walker ranch know, it's enormous. It's a, I believe it's more than 2000 acres. I think we should look at the Wikipedia for skin Walker ranch before we look at this freaks mushroom website because I think Wikipedia has got a pretty accurate description of what's going on. It's going skin walk around. Do they? Yeah, cause I looked it up. Okay. What does Wikipedia say? I can't remember. I, my main understanding of skin

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       walker ranch comes from Dr. Eric Davis. Okay. Says, according to local legend Skin Walker ranch, also known as Sherman ranch, is a property located approximately 480 acres south east of Bowerbird, Utah. That is allegedly the site of paranormal and Ufo related activities. It's name is taken from the skin Walker of native American legend. Okay. Let's see what the hell the skin walker, has he ever heard of that? Nope. Okay. Let's a skin walker, boom, boom, boom. And some native American legends. A skin walker is a person with the supernatural ability to turn into any animal he or she desires. You know what that really is? Why Pay Aod? Yeah. Right. That's what that is. Is their pay Odi out there? Hell yeah. Uh, San Pedro, Cactus Sun all day. Okay. To be able to transform legend sometimes requires that the skin walker. Where's a pelt of the animal though this is not always considered necessary. So they get high, they see guy with a fur coat. They think it's a bear. We're out. Sure. Solve that one. Sure. Thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. Native Americans, you can drop the silliness. Hey man, back when you had no TV and he did have payoti. This is the kind of things he believed claims about. The ranch first appeared in the Salt Lake City, Utah Desert. Deseret. It says desert. Brett says desert rat d s e r e t news. Is that sounds right. It is actually correct. It's the Deseret news. Hmm. I wonder why they call it the no, it's the Deseret news.

Speaker 4:          01:18:53       Oh, it's a Mormon term. Deseret. Some Mormon term. Silly pitches. Bunch of Voodoo fuckheads. Anyway, um, first appeared claims about the ranch, first appeared in Salt Lake City, Utah, Deseret news, and later in alternative weekly Las Vegas Mercury as a series of articles by journalists. George. Now George snap is one of those guys that's always involved in like Ufo stuff and fringe stuff. So Hey, all of a sudden I'm going, ah, you know, he's one of those area 51 dude's nap and coauthor comb Kale. Her subsequently authored a book. Oh, a book which they're selling, which they described the ranch being acquired by the National Institute for Discovery Science Needs. That's big. Allow yes to study anecdotal sightings of Ufos, bigfoot like creatures, crop circles, ha, glowing orbs and poltergeist activity reported by its former owners. The ranch located in. Good luck with this one. U. I. N. T. A. H. Ooh. Ooh Wee wee into county to

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       winter. Is that what it is? I see it the winter. Winter. You sure? Yeah. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:20:14       The ranch located in west Uintah county bordering on the Indian reservation was popular dub the Ufo ranch due to its ostensible 50 year history of odd events said to have taken place there. According to these folks, they saw or investigated evidence of close to 100 incidents that include vanishing and mutilated cattle sightings of unidentified flying objects or orbs, large animals with piercing yellow eyes, paying odor that they say were not injured when they were struck by boards. That's the, uh, the bulletproof and invisible objects admitting destructive magnetic fields. Among those involved the retired army colonel John Be Alexander, who characterize the needs effort as an attempt to get hard data using standard scientific approach. However, the investigators admitted to difficulty obtaining evidence consistent with scientific publication.

Speaker 3:          01:21:19       Yeah, but that right there, that admittance is what lends them credibility. The people who don't say stuff like that or the people who you shouldn't trust. But when you have scientists saying, yeah, we couldn't really find the evidence for some reason it lends a little bit more credibility to the two reports, especially when one, I talked to one of the scientists, Dr. Eric Davis, and he said that he saw something with his own eyes and I really don't see why that guy would have any reason to lie to me.

Speaker 4:          01:21:45       Well, I'm just skeptic James. Randy awarded Bigelow a pig assists award for funding purchase of the property for what he termed a useless study of a haunted ranch in Utah. James, Randy is like such a Douche. Yeah, I seems like it. It seems like a real party pooper. Yeah. So what a party pooper man, the guy wants. Guy's got $1 billion once by a UFO ranch. Why are you going to give him an award? I'm going to give you the biggest is towards a Pegasus is a pig. That flight, get it tongue in cheek when pigs fly and it's awarded by noted skeptic James Renner.

Speaker 3:          01:22:22       Well, it shouldn't Randy be happy. But when the scientist report that they, there's, they didn't find any.

Speaker 4:          01:22:27       No, because his, his ego is wrapped up and debunking thing. Right. And if he can like glow attention to himself by giving out an award, if they, if you fos did exist and he found evidence, he'd probably like sweep it under the rug. Right. How's it? Let's see here. Yeah, keep the foundation going. Yeah. Right. You know, I mean obviously probably not. Probably be shitting his pants and start apologizing. Yeah. Probably be like, it would be like a psychedelic experience. It depends on what kind of alien it was. Well, if it was like some close encounters of the third contact shit, that would be a pretty soggy dog experience. If a gigantic duty, if that just

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       hovered over the desert floor and these little tiny dudes, giant heads and big black eyes came out and started talking to us. What'd you get on the ship? Nope. I think that's the funniest thing. That guy just gets onboard. That's so stupid. Why would you do that? Then? You're stuck with these little assholes forever. Even at your jokes. Jokes. That's how they go hunting. Does no comedy clubs in space. They probably don't have any porn and if they did, it's them fucking, and the way they fuck is probably with their fingers. They probably handshake each other and fall down spasm and orgasm. They're big heads. The reason why they're big heads, the outside of it as a cushion for when they black out and they shake hands and come, they fall. They're big heads bounce like a fucking book below and it's to protect their brains inside Donk, donk, donk, donk.

Speaker 1:          01:23:52       It's like a ball bouncing. You wouldn't get on a ship. No fucking way. I'd like people. I'm really happy. I'm a person and I like people. I don't need to go to space. I think it'd be cool to see it. I'd be, it'd be cool to like look at the shit, but what have you going to take me like a monkey in a zoo? Do you think those chimps want to be in the zoo the fuck they do? Of course they don't. And why would they differentiate between the way we treat intelligent animals like dolphins and throw him in a fucking swimming pool? Why would they decide to treat us so much better than the way we've treated everything that we see? Right. You think when at Dolphin ends up on a seaworld bout, it thinks it's the same as being on a Ufo and it's super intelligent name on mine.

Speaker 1:          01:24:31       It's probably like these on wonderful beings. They're taking me to paradise. The next thing you know, they spit it out in some piss out pool. Are they going to do flips for toddlers? Exactly. When w you know, we, we see a mountain lion eat a dog and we shoot that mountain lion. We justify murdering the Sanama because this animal murders, if we see us imprisoning dolphins, if these aliens see us in prison dolphins, why wouldn't they imprison us? Oh, these guys are dicks. Maybe aliens only should go to seaworld and the zoo and just scoop up zookeepers and trainers take those finance, all the, all the kids clapping their hands as these super intelligent beings that used to be able to swim through an infinite, practically infinite sea with their tribe and their family are now like doing embarrassing tricks for fish, for shitheads. It's the worst of the worst. So I, I wouldn't get on board. That's how I'm feeling. There's no way I wouldn't even think about getting on board if they landed and they like, would you like to come with us to another galaxy table? Like a bitch? Get the fuck out of here. Like driving now man, you've given a good marriage.

Speaker 1:          01:25:45       So do you think that's what it was at Richard Dreyfus? He didn't really, wasn't really a good his family. And he was like, fuck these kids, I'm going to get on board. It's the ultimate thing cause he knows he's wanting to get a divorce and he just says thinking, do I want to go through divorce proceedings or fly to Alpha Centauri with these watermelon heads. Do you know that Steven Spielberg said that if he made them moving today after having children, he would do it differently. What would he do? He wouldn't leave his children and that he wouldn't have had Richard Drivers get on board the space ship. And that was something that a single man would do. And that a, a person who has children wouldn't do. And that to me makes all the sense in the world. Sure. Cause that's, that's, I kind of thought that when I watched it I was like, man, I got just leaving his kids. Like that's kind of fucked up. Give me a break man. There was a lot of guys who walk into casinos, like drive his, walked into that Ufo. Yeah. They just go wandering in with a smile on their face. Cla Or brats. I'm going to the slots. That's true.

Speaker 5:          01:26:39       They me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, meaning Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding.

Speaker 1:          01:26:44       And really kind of similar. That's an alien environment as well. Yeah. I mean, where do you ever get that many electronic noises? All screaming at you, man trap. Yeah. It's like when you lay out traps for rats with cheese, that's tourists. Every fucking one of them has like a video screen above it with dancing girls and tight dresses and everyone's cheering when the money flows. Famous

Speaker 3:          01:27:05       TV shows. It's very, very hypnotic. I've thrown money into the slots. When I go to vague, I said, grabs my attention. Yeah, and it's somehow calming, like it's fills up so many of your senses that it really is like a weirdly calming experience to gamble. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:27:21       Yeah. For a lot of folks, it's incredibly intoxicating too because it goes back to that hunter gatherer thing, but we don't have any real risk in our lives. We don't have any real immediate risk reward. There's a life and death aspect to losing $1,000. Right? You're like, oh my God, that's a, it's a month of my life or that's a week of my life saving. You know, he like, if you think about how much money can you save in a month for most folks that are kind of getting by, if you could save $1,000 a month, that's pretty damn good. That's put away 12 grand a year for most folks. That's pretty good. So you're really losing a month of your life when you gamble or possibly gaining a month. It's a month and I couldn't be better this month. I got by a car. Yeah. There's a life or death aspect of that that plays upon that. The same instincts. Yep. They're not being fueled by this nerved out world. Yeah. It's, yeah, you're right, man. You're right. We long for something. Yeah, it's true.

Speaker 3:          01:28:15       But I, you know, man, I don't, after talking to Eric Davis and when you see the footage, you might think I'm an idiot. You might just decide that the guys and is, uh, not, not on the beam so to speak. But I really, uh, I dunno, I, when you have somebody tell you that they've seen lights hovering lights, I don't know. I guess I'm just naive because I just pulled, I believed him. I get it. Right. You didn't feel like he was lying and it felt legitimate to me and it wasn't even, look, if you're going to lie about a Ufo story, make it big. Right. You know why? Just say, yeah, I saw hovering lights. I don't think that those lights could have been a hoax. I have no way to explain it, you know? Yeah. I just didn't feel like I was being lied to.

Speaker 4:          01:29:04       Well, I mean, that's interesting because that's the same feeling that we had when we talked to that woman Barbara, in the corner store in Washington when she was talking about Sasquatch and our siding. It sounds completely ridiculous if you look at it on paper. When that woman was talking to us, we were like, wow, she is believable in a very odd way that I, I didn't expect anyone to be believable. Everybody else told me that Ufo stories, and I was like, Oh yeah, okay. Does that happen? Hmm. Okay. Thank you for your story. But I was like, this is a little hole. But she was talking and I was like, whoa. You know, and I was sober. So that's, that means a lot.

Speaker 3:          01:29:39       Yeah, man. When this Eric Davis and a really accurate, precise way describe the math that would go into creating a warp drive and explained wormholes and then pointed out all these experiments that were getting no results and then told me that he had seen hovering lights and made me believe him, I believe. I think he saw something out there. I don't think it's improbable that something's out there. Maybe it's a natural occurrence. Why not? Maybe you know, certain parts of the Earth have a tendency to create very rare phenomena that humans tend to ascribe as being alien who has, maybe it is ball lightning ready. We'll go out there and just see ball lightning. You know what? I've never seen ball lightning. I'd love to.

Speaker 4:          01:30:22       That would be very cool if we went out there and just got ball lightning on film. I would be psyched. Yeah. I don't even know how you would differentiate between that and the UFO though. We would probably cry UFO first.

Speaker 3:          01:30:32       We would definitely cry you if I were going to say we saw a Ufo. If a bird phone,

Speaker 4:          01:30:39       let's just start lying. Just like they do. We should start doing the convention circuit hooking up with Ufo believers. We've got to get together in the hotel before and get our story straight and you're like, don't man. I'm tired of being anal probed. Let's leave that out. Yeah. I don't want to talk about that, but listen, today we can't do that because in Utah we talked about anal probing and a little thing called the internet. So Nevada, you have to, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:31:04       Wow. Why did you say that now? It didn't stick to that permits the Lore. I went with the folk. Lord didn't go with the law. You. It's embarrassing. It's, it's in my mind. I did well. Why'd you say you liked it? I didn't say I liked her. I saw, I love that.

Speaker 4:          01:31:24       Let's go to a skin walker ranch. Ben. Cool scope. We're going to go. We're going to set up cameras. We're going to bring technology, we're going to bring our friend Donnie who has drones, are going to try to get the drones to fly over the property. Cool. Only the legal parts where it's legal to fly over.

Speaker 3:          01:31:40       Yeah. Great. See something cool. Cool. Cause I've never done anything like that in my life. Like I've gone out and laid in a yard. I've gone out in the forest and looked up in the sky for a few minutes, but I've never actively tried to have a Ufo sighting.

Speaker 4:          01:31:53       Well maybe [inaudible] it if you believe Dr. Steven Greer, he thinks you can summon them. Really? How intent. Oh really? Focusing in a tent and they just go, hey,

Speaker 3:          01:32:04       wow man, that must be why he has all that amazing footage of the U of m.

Speaker 4:          01:32:08       So convenient. Yeah, he does hours of it was very convincing, very convincing. That's why he changed the world. He's got fucking birds and night vision. There's a guy named Ryan Skinner and uh, we're going to meet him there and he's been studying skin walker ranch and he's going to show us the INS and out and sort of give us a sense of what other people have seen there, how much of it's hooey and what he really believes is going on. Cool. Skin Walker ranch baby. Here we come. Can't wait. Bring sunscreen. Does it get hot out there? I am. Well No, I'm saying for the electric magnetic radiation from the wormholes, the sunscreen protects you from that little thin film of oil and it gets zapped by the, the glow around a magnetic field of a flying disc and you're fine.

Speaker 3:          01:32:58       Who knows? Man, you know, there is some small chance that they're going to find is camera equipment scattered everywhere or just withered up husks our mouth open when Anna scream frozen from something that emerged.

Speaker 4:          01:33:12       Yeah, just like cattle mutilations. Yeah. That would be incredible. Yeah. If they had academy inhalation, but it was a person instead of a cattle and the same things were done, there will be a real problem. Have you ever looked at some of those cattle mutilations? It's really good.

Speaker 3:          01:33:26       It's really freaky stuff. Regarding the cattle mutilations, Eric Davis said that they studied this stuff and they said it seems to be being done by humans again man. When when people are Kooks everything's aliens, right? When you hear somebody say no, that wasn't a, that was, it seems to be like a, he said that the cuts were done more by a scalpel than the lasers that people report and it seemed to be terrestrial, whatever. You know, it's a weird thing. Who knows what people are doing it, but the fact is this guy was willing to say that's not aliens. So that to me lends credibility to his report of having seen aliens out there. Interesting. Great stuff. Do you think that if we got roasted by aliens, Psi Phi would be happy or sad?

Speaker 4:          01:34:08       They'd be happy. Yeah. An alien rose will be amazing. Not like, not like the friars club and that's what I was thinking. I was thinking it'd be like, like a roast. Like we sit on the DAS and they'll come up and go, here's the funny thing about Duncan Trussell. A lot of people don't know that. Under that Fedora is an inflatable alien hat crop circle. He wants to pretend it's a bald spot. It's actually a fairly accurate depiction of all his favorite crop circles carved into his head. All right, we're going to go skin walker ranch,

Speaker 6:          01:34:48       boom. Let's see what's happening. Great. What do you think going to be successful? Yes, ma'am. I think it's, I think, yes. I think we're going to see something.
