Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Five, four, three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Well, I'll start. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Hello. Dr. McGee. That sounds not me pitching. If you're hearing that, you're like, what is this? Is this a podcast and a bathroom? No, that's coffee. How are you buddy? Good. Thank you for having me. Thanks for being here. For folks who have heard me a rant and rave about the fantastic results that I've had, I'm getting treatment on my shoulder where I was that close to getting surgery. It's this gentleman, Dr Mcphee, who has a fixed me up out of Las Vegas, Nevada. And uh, now we're here to talk about it. Yeah, no, I appreciate the chance to be here. What do you have, man? A very short words today. He was very talkative before the podcast folks. That's how it goes. But now I'm hearing myself and that was it. Weird you out? Yeah, you take them off.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       We can take them off as too weird. He'd never done a podcast like this for you. Did John Dudley's. Yeah. Is Excellent. We can take it off. I might have to. Okay, let's take it off. I don't want to freak you out. Yeah. Is that better? This is a little more like a normal conversation. I don't want to freak you out. To me it's better cause like I can hear like if it's things are wrong, what's a, what's the notes Daddy? Oh, what do you got there? Uh, just a couple of things I jotted down. Just make sure a gift you all the information you want to hear. Well, I just want to tell you that I feel super fortunate to have met you and to have been treated by you and to be able to have these conversations with you and your office, which is why I wanted to have you here to talk to you because I mean, I was having some really significant shoulder issues before.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       Um, you treated it and it's, it's amazing the results and what, what, you know, I mean, what, what I've avoided, avoided in shoulder surgery. Yeah. I mean you've had a tremendous result. So, uh, obviously we're very thankful that you're able to get that benefit. And I think we're in my community of Orthopedic Surgery and sports medicine. You know, we're very excited about the possibility and eager to continue to learn about it and see what it can be and how it can help and what it does best for. What now? Where's all this stuff coming from? Like winter? Where is this science coming from and how has it evolved over the last few years? Well, um, a lot of the stuff that we're using is not new in terms of, uh, the tissue or a, that type of thing. But it's actually that the application for Orthopedic Sports Medicine, so you could go back decades to when it's been used in plastic surgery, uh, for corneal ulcers is one of the original applications of placental tissue. So the idea of it isn't necessarily new, it's just that as we've gained more understanding in our community of orthopedic surgery, now we're starting to see what the applications can be. Now, when you say plastic surgery, like what have they done with it? With plastic surgery, mostly helping with wounds, complication, wound healing, and the potential

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       for there to be wound healing without scarring. So that's one of the things that we'll get into. How do they do that? Um, it's part of the mechanism of how the cell helps the process of the healing. So, but we'll talk about that for sure. Now when they extract the placental tissue, like how are they, they're, they're doing it on young women who have had [inaudible] sections, crusher. So bypasses a lot of the ethical concerns that a lot of people had during the Bush administration, which kept them. Okay. So let's, you said a couple of different important things, so let's start breaking that down a little bit. So the first thing is, um, you know, where does it come from? It comes from a young, healthy mother. In this case, what we're talking about, um, this particular category of biologic treatment or cellular tissue, uh, this comes from a young healthy mother that's having elective c section and prior to the delivery has agreed to make a charitable donation.

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       And then they have been screened and there's a process that must be followed by the American Association of Tissue Banks. And they have a series of blood tests that they have to go through. And so you're checking to be sure that there's no communicable disease, you know, for example, hepatitis or HIV, uh, things of that nature. And so once that has been cleared and they're an acceptable donor, then they go through the delivery, the tissues collected. And as you said, this is stuff that typically would go in the garbage. So, um, essentially the, you know, the ethical and the moral dilemma shouldn't exist for that portion of it because otherwise it's just garbage. Now that's taken by the company that has harvested and they have their processing center, which also has to be, uh, evaluated and approved by this aatp American Association of Tissue Banks, uh, to be a facility that is up to their standards.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       So they have a sterilization process. The tissue's not contaminated. Their packaging is appropriate that are, you know, their shipping's not causing problems with the tissue. So you have to meet all these standards is very stringent. And so if you have that, if a company has that, uh, approval, then you know, they, they meet the standards allowed so that that stuff can then go either to an office or to a hospital. So now the, the next thing of what you said, um, let's talk a little bit about, uh, uh, President Bush and that whole discussion. So first of all, that is about embryonic stem cells. Okay. An embryonic stem cell, and that's, you know, that doesn't have anything to do with what we're doing. Um, an embryonic stem cell is when the sperm and the egg join and begin to form the beginning sells a life and there's initially two cells and then it divides into four, eight, et cetera. In the f the first five days of life,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       that's called a blastocyst. And those cells can be harvested, um, and they are what we call toady potent. That means they can become anything. They have the ability to transform into any line of tissue or Oregon, or in the case of that first five days of life, those individual cells can actually become a complete organism. So that's, that's where we have, you know, the cloning of the sheep. So that's what happens. So they, they took the cells in that first couple of days and then they divide process to allow it to continue to grow. And, and so you had two different, from a single sperm and egg, you had two organisms, complete mammals, you know, created. So when you say this blastocyst, is that how you say it? That's just the term for the initial, you know, the ball of cells that's formed. And how many cells is in a blastocyst?

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       Well, they're dividing over the number of days in doubling each time. So then thousands, not by that time. No. Hundreds. You're 16, you know, 32. So if you have 32, how many different organisms can you make off of those 32 cells? Technically, if you have a toadie potent cell, every individual cell has the ability to become a complete organism. Whoa. So that could be one. Blastocyst could be 32 different people, I guess. Potentially. Wow. I don't know if that experiment's been carried out, but theoretically at least. Wow. So, um, now when they have like frozen embryos, when people do things like that, when they decide they want to have kids later in life and they freeze their embryos, how the hell are they doing that? What's, what's that about? And I'm not like a reproduction specialists so we might be getting, you know Adam, but it's frozen embryos.

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       A lot of times they don't get used. Right. I don't know. I don't know how that works. Um, cause I know there's been battles, like people have had battles with their wives and stuff. That's very much the, my understanding of it would be that if you're, you know, you're freezing it with the intention of maintaining the cell viability and so somebody has demonstrated that you could then thaw that sal and it still has the opportunity to divide, produce and you know, become a living thing. Wow. I was thinking like for the non-viable ones or the ones that don't get turned into people, they could probably use those as well. Right. Well that, that's a big, that was the thing, right? That was the big George Bush thing. Well. Okay, so let's back up on that because I think there's a lot of misconception about that. And I hear like very strange comments made about it all the time in the media. So the thing that George Bush signed in 2001 stated that the federal government was not going to supply money for embryonic stem cell research. That's it. It was not a ban on the APP, on nation, on stem cell research. So for all of that time, I mean private equity companies in any private investor could have and probably been spending the money

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       to continue to research that and develop it and find it. So I always find it interesting when I hear on TV, oh, like the, our country has been set back a decade because they signed to this, you know, Bill. I'm like, so you feel that's wrong? Yeah, that's so, um, but all he said was, we're not going to dedicate federal money to it. Right. That's different than a ban on any study. But how much research does rely on federal funding? And I don't know. I mean there's, there's private funding for all kinds of things. So is it more common now than it is before or is it always been the case where there's a lot of private funding? So President Obama in 2009 lifted the ban on the federal funding. So federal fundings been going on for it since, since then. Interesting. Yeah. So what is the difference in terms of the viability of placental stem cells that you would get from a woman in necessary and section versus something that you would get from a blastocyst?

Speaker 2:          00:09:52       Well, so a couple of things about that. Um, one there's, um, it's actually to our benefit in orthopedics not to be using that line of cells because those cells starting from that time point have the ability to have teratogenic potential. So what that means is they can potentially form tumors. So that makes it obviously a big disadvantage because now we're, we're adding our risk to what we're doing once they've gotten to the point where it's a part of the, the whole, you know, we call this like a human placental stem cells or Mesenchymal stem cell. And that includes the placenta, the umbilical cord, the Wharton's Jelly is a mucus type substance. It's around the arteries of the umbilical cord, the amnion or the amniotic sac, which is the inner layer around the the baby. And then the outer layer is called the cory on. Now all of that has cells in it that we would put in the category of Ms Inca, most stem cells or Mesenchymal stem cell.

Speaker 2:          00:11:01       And what that means is they have a specific line of tissues that they can become. So now back to when I was explaining the formation of the blastocyst becomes a Morella becomes, uh, an embryo eventually. So in that process, uh, you have this ball of tissue and then it starts to kind of fold in on itself. And then it starts to layer out into these three layers. You have endoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm, the, um, each of those kinds of is directed towards a certain line of cells and tissues. The misa Durham, and what these, uh, the Mesenchymal stem cells can become, are all of the things that we care about in orthopedics. So cartilage, bone, muscle, ligament, tendon. So we have that whole line of cells, um, that this particular sale has the potential to become. So when we talk about a stem cell, the by definition, what it means is one, it can divide and become another stem cell so it can, it can duplicate itself so that now you have another cell that can divide and become another cell or it can divide and differentiate into a cell that then has the characteristics of the things that you're hoping it will become.

Speaker 2:          00:12:25       Now that's a, uh, directed in ordered approach in embryology. And in the case of, uh, treating an injury, what we're hoping is that that can differentiate into the injured tissue. And how long have they been doing that while studies on that have been going on for at least 10 years. So I want to say maybe back as early as 2007. Um, now we've been, if you go in a way back to the early days of a arthroscopy, and now it'd be like the late seventies and early 1980s, uh, and I don't know exactly what year, you know, he would have started doing this, but, um, doctor steadman at, uh, in Vail, Colorado and he was in Reno and Lake Tahoe area before that. They would, um, this, he's the one that developed the microfracture procedure. I don't know if you're familiar with that. You've had a couple of knee surgery, so I don't know if you've heard that term, but I have, but I don't really recall exactly what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       Sure. So basically if a patient had a small cartilage defect, he took a small, uh, an all or like what looked like a tiny little pick and made a puncture into the bone. And what that did is it releases marrow elements along with blood. And they were able to see with time, and you know, there were occasions when they got to have second look arthroscopy that that cartilage could fill in. Now they also found that that didn't become the native cartilage. It becomes something called fibro cartilage. So when you look at it under a microscope, it looks different compared to our normal cartilage. Hmm. Appearance like physically looks the same, but under the microscope looks different. What is the difference? Uh, well, the main difference in, in what's applicable is that, um, it's doesn't have the same structural properties. So it was more easily able to kind of come off with a sheer force.

Speaker 2:          00:14:29       So just picture like you were bending. Yeah. You could kind of flake off or, or in some cases just didn't form as well as you know, you would want. Hmm. So, so that experience, um, and I, you know, having conversations with the guy that I trained with, his name's Larry Lemak in Birmingham. He noted just over his career that he always felt like patients that had worse arthritis, but they would do this microfracture procedure on in knee arthroscopy actually would do better than patients with less arthritis, but that they didn't do the procedure. And so it had always been in his mind that, that somehow that marrow stimulation was, was providing something that was helping with either healing or pain relief. Um, and, and it's only now that we start to understand, you know, because the bone marrow has some of these mesenchymal stem cells available also.

Speaker 2:          00:15:22       And we'll kind of talk about the differences and stuff like that. So it was essentially like a crude version of some stem cell transplants, like, yeah, I think that's a good way to put it. Yeah. I mean, our hope is that we're, we're using cells that can again, change into other things that we want. And when did they start applying this on people? Like in terms of not just tests and studies, but actually in practice, like what you do? Uh, well, in Orthopedic Sports Medicine, I don't think I started to hear about it until around 2012. So that was the first year that I was in practice and I attended a conference in Las Vegas and it was called the emerging techniques in orthopedics. So they were kind of talking about what's the, the newest and uh, you know, most forward thinking ideas that are coming through. So a company presented and one of the physicians presented information showing that they had harvested fat tissue from patients abdomens and injected into their knee, um, for patients that had knee arthritis and they were showing new growth of cartilage and, and actually improvement in some of the x rays.

Speaker 2:          00:16:37       So when you look at an x ray, there's some characteristics that we look at that, you know, define what arthritises. So if the patient has narrowing of the joint space or they have bone spurs, things like that, um, they were actually seeing more space between the bones and some of these serial x rays. So, you know, I saw that and that was just like so incredible and something that I'd never heard about, read about or you know, had encountered before. And that's really what kind of sparked my interest. And what are they doing with the fat? Cause I've, I've heard that they do stem cells, the virtual, like a, like a mini liposuction, right. And then they're, you know, they either spin it in a centrifuge or there's a, there, you know, these syringes that you can pass it through a filter and then you reinject it. And, and what you're trying to do is, is again, take advantage of the fact that there's these mesenchymal stem cells in the tissue and like what can they just, are they just taking the fat, like when they spin it in a centrifuge, like what does that accomplish? Uh, just separates out the, the cells. So then you can inject the portion that you want. And we do that. Usually I've had it with PRP. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So just I've, I've had with Regina King,

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       which is like a form, right? PRP, correct. Yeah. With a heated up and becomes like a yellow serum. Right? So when their platelet layer of the blood and you're looking at, okay. Yeah. And so the, the red cells separate out and you can, you can easily see that in the tube. And what is the difference in the results from someone who does that? Because I know quite a few people who've done it that way. They've had injuries treated where they suck the fat out. There isn't any, uh, any research to differentiate like one of these treatments versus another yet it's just not available. So it's all anecdotal in terms of like talking to patients. It's happening. I mean, people are collecting the data, but it's just not, you know, it's not at the mature stage where, um, you know, where it's available and we have published stuff to look at and personally know of anybody who's had really good results using the fat method.

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       Um, yes, actually, uh, a physician friend of mine in Memphis, Tennessee, her name's doctor Laura Lenderman. Um, she has utilized that quite a bit and she's been very happy with the patients that she's treated in. Naturally. Some people do better than others, but you know, the, the real, the rigorous study of this though is still yet to come. It's really fascinating. Like d have you considered trying that or you just definitely, yeah. But you don't so far you just do the stem cells haven't had anybody specifically request it and, uh, maybe somebody wants to lose a little fat and fix her knees. Yeah, I mean that's, that's probably taking things in a direction I don't want to be going. But by plastic surgery are, we know there are a number of different options in terms of where these sources of the cells can come from. Um, bone marrow is certainly had a lot of use and Daniel Qca had that done.

Speaker 1:          00:19:39       That's what he told me. Yeah. He had a pulled out of his hip and he said it was brutally painful then he was walking with a limp for like two weeks. It's a, obviously it's a procedure. Um, there's pain and there's, you know, morbidity. There's a consequence to, you know, putting a sharp object into the bone and drying them. Yeah. So that means, uh, a bad thing. I don't like that word now. It's, we don't like it either. In medicine, more bid is a bad word. We have conferences called Morbidity and mortality and that's where you basically own up to things that you've done a terrible job with or explain, you know, why somebody has died as a result of your care. And it's a awful thing to go through and it's critically important to be able to evaluate yourself and understand what things happen when they don't go the way that we want them to. So it's an important exercise that physicians go through to review cases. So I can only imagine. Yeah, I mean, especially if you're dealing with people that are broken apart. I mean, essentially as an orthopedic surgeon, you're dealing with, people's bodies have failed, right? Your limbs have failed, ligaments have torn off the bone, and these have exploded. I mean, you've

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       told me some gnarly stuff in terms of the kind of injuries that you've had to treat, and I could only imagine some of bad things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so your time doing this with placental stem cells, how long have you been doing that? Uh, it's been a couple of years. So essentially you did mine, I think. How long ago was it? I think it was July of 2015 yeah. So I kind of came in pretty, pretty early because Jeff Davidson to doctor from the UFC, he was the one who told me about it because he had shoulder surgery and um, he was very stiff and had real problems after the shoulder surgery and was, I'm just very unhappy with his range of motion and the pain that is experiencing. And then he got some stem cell treatments and it just all went away. Then he trains a lot. Yeah. Trains really hard and he's very fit,

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       pretty impressed with, uh, you know what he told me about how he was, what he was able to get back to you after, you know, he had been treated with, uh, that type of injection.

Speaker 3:          00:21:48       Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he told me and then I was like on the fence. I mean, I'd seen an orthopedic surgeon and the only thing that was keeping me from getting surgery is, you know, he put me through all these, um, stress tests where he pushed down on my arm and all this time and I resisted all of them. And he's like, this is, it's kind of odd, but your injuries this bad, but you have so much strength in your joints still. Yeah. Like maybe you should hold off a little bit before you get the surgery. He's like,

Speaker 2:          00:22:13       cause I thought that when I examined you two because I really couldn't reproduce your pain. Yeah. So and that, and that's, that's another reason and then I probably would have been in the same boat as the first guy in terms of uh, you know, trying to make a decision about surgery. Um, because you know, if your physical exam doesn't, you know, show that somebody has some significant deficits, it's, it's hard to make the jump to take somebody to surgery.

Speaker 3:          00:22:39       Well, during normal, everyday life there'd be like zero pain. Right. Problem is what I put my body through. His has nothing that resembles normal everyday life, Jujitsu and kickboxing and kettle bells and archery and yeah, there's just so much explosive movements and so much weight bearing movements and doing really high demand stuff. Yeah. So in that, in that case, that was one of the reasons why I was thinking, cause like I don't want to walk around with a compromised body. I'm like, if I have to just get surgery and then take six months of Rehab or whatever it was like, what is the, for a type of shoulder injury that I had, what is the rehabilitation time?

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       Um, you know, for sure probably three months. I mean, it, it can be longer than that. It depends on the patient. Um, somebody like you that in one of the things that we, uh, have trouble with, with some patients, they've never even lifted weights for example. Oh yeah. So for them, the Rehab, recovery and rehab, we're introducing things to them that they've never seen or done. Right. And they don't understand the difference, you know, being sore and in pain. That's, that they should be conscious about. Um, it's challenging, it's hard work and it's uncomfortable. And so some patients, you know, they struggle to get through that part of it, um, in a naturally will take longer to improve. So it's harder for them to get their motion. It's longer, much longer for them to return their strength. Now you already have like a significant baseline level of strength, so much easier in your case to bounce back. And then also the things that you would do in rehab there are so rudimentary, you know, you would move through that very quickly. And then, uh, once you're at the point where you have had enough tissue healing and it's safe to progress, you, um, you know, through higher level exercises, then you could really push it and you would, I mean, you would be committed to it. Dedicated, diligent. I mean we'd almost have to hold you back. Yeah, that was another

Speaker 3:          00:24:38       question that I had. How often do you have people where that is the, the issue? Like I know you, you've treated a bunch of fighters and when you treat mma fighters, is that an issue where you're trying to like slow them down? Go

Speaker 2:          00:24:49       all the time. You got to let people know, like, and one of my, uh, you know, one of the lines that I'd say to all my patients, um, regularly is you got to respect biology. Like you have to allow the healing to happen. I know you feel good. I know you're moving good and you're ready to go. You want to be back on the court, on the field, things like that. But if we don't take the proper progression, you know, we risk having you reinjure and then you're right back in that same boat. We don't, we only want to have you miss the most limited block of time that you can. So I never want to, I don't want people to miss one more practice game, you know, match workout or whatever. Then they have to, uh, but same time we don't want to put them in a situation that's unsafe. So it's always a, it's a balancing act.

Speaker 3:          00:25:35       So in your time of doing this, have you had people that didn't respond to this particular topic? Definitely, yeah. Definitely. Yeah. And were they the people that we talked about before that don't exercise and

Speaker 2:          00:25:46       Arnie each shape or is it across the board? You know, I would have to go back and look and, and kind of critically evaluate each case. Um, certainly, you know, we worry about the patient that has lower like baseline fitness, like their overall health is poorer, you know, and what their response might be. But I think that's information that is still to come. But definitely, I mean, some of the people that have responded the most dramatically, like for example, you and John Dudley, I mean, you guys are fanatical about your nutrition. You're working out regularly, you're doing all kinds of things to optimize your chance to not, you know, in this case he'll, but in other instances perform. Uh, and I have to believe that that has, you know, that's a huge factor.

Speaker 3:          00:26:36       Yeah. I would wonder what, how much of a factor it is if your body is conditioned in a way to constantly generate muscle tissue

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       and breaking down and rebuilding and she was always constantly under stress. Definitely has to be a part of it. Mm. You know, I think it's, um, it's not the typical realm of my specialty to be looking at all those other factors. But I think with all of the information that's becoming available, one of the cool things for me has been, it's forcing me to have to learn about it. It's forcing me to have to take look at it, you know, how can we do better? What are we ignoring? And I think if you're not looking at every aspect of that wheel, then you're missing a chance to do as good as you can for, for each patient. Um, and it might be things that we have to do before somebody even has treatment. We may have to bring them up to some baseline level with a number of different things, you know.

Speaker 2:          00:27:31       Um, and so, and the other side of it too is we're, we're in a, we're in a system now where there's so much information, you know, one person can't be your source for everything, so you really have to have a good team all around you. Um, I think that's really important. I find myself more and more seeking help, help and just saying, hey, I just don't, I don't know enough about this. Like, can you, can you help me with this? Or explain it better or you know, can I have the patient talk with you and, and maybe get some more information. And I think that may give them even better a chance to do well just because the options and the possibilities are so comprehensive and time. So, you know, in, in a typical orthopedic practice, you don't have a ton of time to go through all of this with every patient.

Speaker 2:          00:28:16       Um, and so you just have to make sure that you're providing resources and, and getting them as good information is available. One of the things I thought was interesting, you were telling me that there's been really good results with people going into a sauna directly after treatment. Well, I don't know that there's been good results. I think it's, it's interesting. And the things that you've talked about for other applications in terms of heat shock proteins, you know, there's some belief that that may either assist the cells and pro proliferation or their ability to, you know, have as robust a, um, a response as possible. You know, that's not proven. That's, that's hypothesis. But I think it's interesting and again, it's, it's falls into the category of a lot of these things that we're talking about where the science, the basic science is, they're like, we understand how it happens in the embryo, in the developing child.

Speaker 2:          00:29:10       We know what it does in a lab. Like we can add these things to a petri dish and watch it, watch these changes happen. But nobody has demonstrated this in a human, in a clinical trial where we're treating an injury. So we have to be very careful about that. And that in fact that the FDA is very clear that, you know, we cannot be making those claims. Companies can't be making those claims about their products and physicians cannot be making claims and marketing their practice to drive people to them stating that these things were. Now

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       when you talk about heat shock proteins, um, I dunno if you can answer this question, but is there a difference between the heat shock proteins that you receive from, say like a steam shower, like a steam room versus a sauna versus even a hot bath? I've heard of people saying that you'd get heat shock proteins from a very hot bath and I think you would have to, there would have to be some kind of biopsy or blood test and you know, sample like have people go through each of those things and control for all those factors. Right. But the whole idea is just being involved in an environment that's extremely hot, where your body is like, what is this guy doing? And then it produces the heat shock proteins to try to compensate. Yeah. As a protective mechanism. So that the, just the, the knowledge of this, I mean this is really interesting because people have been using saunas forever and it was all sort of anecdotal, oh to sauna makes me feel great.

Speaker 1:          00:30:31       And I would look at them like, well what are these assholes doing? They're going to go in there and sweat. I always thought it was people that were just like lazy and they didn't want to lose weight. And so they went to the sauna and they thought they lost weight. Yeah. I really did think they're just dropping water. But I'm talking to Doctor Rhonda Patrick and she was explaining the um, the benefits of a sauna where there was one study where mortality decreased 40% from all causes. Turning the guy literally using the sauna. Yeah. All cause mortality was less. Yeah. 40%. Here it is right now using the sauna four to seven times per week associated with a 40% lower all cause mortality. Might be heat shock, protein science, daily.com. Fascinating stuff. Um, yeah, I can click on it. Click on it. Young Jamie, here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:31:19       So get a little larger than the Journal of American Medical Association. So serious stuff, right? I mean that it's a peer reviewed journal. Yeah. I assume that there may be some validity of the information. Amazing. Um, yeah, I mean if that's correct, if the, if, if all I have to do is get in a sauna and I, you know, can decrease my chance of death from all you had all diseases by 40% like cancer, heart attack, leukemia. Amazing. Here's what a suitable replacement, hot bath won't be as robust but can increase blood flow of eight Harvard and cleat increase heat shock proteins. So she saying it just won't be as robust. Say she's never taken one of my baths. So it's, you know, a simple thing to find out or like what you could do yourself is check your heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, you know, just like, just take those as like a baseline right on after each of those sessions and see if there's difference.

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       How much is your body temperature elevate during those things and how much of it is a surface here is can you can, you can't elevate your core temperature too much or you're going to have, that's what I'm saying, enzymatic breakdown. Like these bad things are gonna happen. Yeah. I wonder like what the line is the point of diminishing returns where the sauna becomes detrimental versus beneficial. Yeah. And I wonder like how a cryotherapy comes into play with that as well because cold shock proteins also show some great benefit in reducing inflammation and yeah. So it was just an amazing time for all the different, definitely the options that are available to people. I think at the same time, uh, one of the things that we have to be conscious of is, you know, being responsible about how we use this information and what we're telling patients.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       And you know, I think there's a lot of misinformation and a lot of people taking advantage of that. And so, um, you know, when we want to try to avoid that, I want to try to give people good information so that they can ask the right questions and they can evaluate places where they're going to see if they're comfortable with what they're being told and what's being offered. So I think there's something like 200 plus regenerative medicine clinics that have popped up in the last couple of years. Hmm. And that means at least 40 of them are bullshit. My math, I mean, maybe, maybe 80, maybe more than that. And they always 90. Well, I just think people have to be cautious and careful about, you know, what, what am I eating, what they're saying. And some of these places have received direct letters from the FDA saying, hey, you can't say that he can't be making claims, um, go over some stuff that's definitely beneficial.

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       Like platelet rich plasma, PRP injections. People have had real benefit from that. Right? Sure. So, um, that has some validated outcome studies. Um, there is a comparison study with prp, uh, on tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis comparing that to corticosteroid injections, which is a common treatment for attempt to give pain relief. Um, in the particular study that I'm thinking of, they had 73% of the patients that receive prp had relief of their pain compared to about 50% of patients with a steroid injection. So that's a head to head study comparing treatment and you know, the advantage seem to be to prp. Now. What is the difference between the results? I don't know if you've even know that it's between the results of PRP and Regena keen. I don't know much about that product actually. I mean, I know what it is. I know that it was, you know, going on in Germany.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       I know a lot of people traveled. Tate ranting, Koby Bryant, all those guys flew Alex Rodriguez or thing Dana White did to the president of the UFC. He went in there for tonight, us, you know, and uh, found through intramuscular injections. There's a deep relief of tinnitus. Mm hmm. You know, so that, I mean, that's great. And again, there may be great applications for all of the different things that fall into this category of biologic treatment. Time is going to tell us what things pan out clinically to be best. I mean, you can look at all kinds of factors and we can draw conclusions from that.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       But ultimately, you know, the proof is going to be when we have, you know, robust clinical studies that compare treatment. Um, and you know, we have follow up physical exams and we have follow up imaging to see exactly what's happening. So we know what we are hoping for. We know what we want to see. We want to see that. Yeah. We have this cell that has a potential to differentiate into other tissue and actually causes healing. Um, but nobody has demonstrated that yet. There are some studies, I mean there's, there's 35 studies, a 29 or animal, there's six, six or seven that are a human trial. I, I just saw this a review paper and I don't, I didn't know if the review paper had been written before. One of the more recent, um, clinical trials was published. Um, there's, so the one was on a knee arthritis and the others were on mostly foot and ankle stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:36:36       Um, the most recent, uh, as from USC and a in combination with, uh, a doctor that's in Indiana and they looked at patients that had a knee arthroscopy and they resected part of the meniscus. So we call it a meniscectomy. And part of it was essentially cut out. So there was a tear. They cut out the bad tissue, they left the remaining healthy tissue and they did an Mri and they measured on the Mri, the volume of meniscal tissue and they injected the patient with a bone marrow aspirate. So in this case was the, you know, be Mac or bone marrow aspirate, um,

Speaker 3:          00:37:15       which is stem cells extracted from bone marrow. Like the way Daniel Cormier they had done. Correct.

Speaker 2:          00:37:20       Okay. So they injected that into the knee and then I think, I want to say it was four or eight months later, I think it was eight months, they re imaged the knee and they found that there was a 15% increase in the municipal volume. So the patients had apparently grown meniscal tissue.

Speaker 3:          00:37:40       I had a meniscus scope on my left knee, um, from, uh, an acl injury that I had, I had an acl surgery, but there was still some meniscus damage. And then, uh, they, they, um, at the time of the acl injury they tried to stitch up the meniscus and okay. They just tried to, tried to repair it, cut it out. And it was a problem for me for several years. And then finally a tour became a bucket handle tear where it locks, you know, so it locked my knee. I was brutally painful in the middle of the Jujutsu class. It was really bad. So, uh, I had to get it scoped and then once I got at scoped, it was oak. It was functional but it would provide me with maybe every couple of weeks. It would be painful. There would be something going on [inaudible] it would be a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:38:30       You shot some stem cells in there a year ago. I've zero problems with it since zero. Nothing. It's like, like I don't even acknowledge that I have a knee that's weaker than the other knee anymore. It doesn't even feel like that anymore. My left knee feels exactly like my right knee now. Yeah, it's crazy. I mean for a decade plus I had pain in that knee, one, one injection a year later, nothing and it was almost within two months. Within two months after the injection. I felt like a significant difference. I was like waiting for those days because those days when I pushed it hard, particularly after kickboxing. Okay. There's something about those like hard pad work, like kicking the pads on the MTA. Any particular things that you were doing that made it feel the worst? That was the big one is just such a striking cause. Striking is just jarring and there's just so much, and I just think there's just, there was laxity in the knee.

Speaker 3:          00:39:30       Said a word to sound wrong. No, I know it's word. I say that it sounds, it sounds wrong. Laxity sounds wrong. It sounds like a laxative, but sounds like I'm making up a word. You know, I was laxity from my laxative. Um, but that kicking motion would always, you know, and it would just hurt and I would put ice on it. You know, it'd be just go about my day. I'm like, wow, it's fine. It's not swelling up to now. It's something you don't think about. Dude, it's zero. I ran a trail yesterday and the mountains like brutal steep trail for two miles. I have zero pain in it today. So this is

Speaker 2:          00:40:03       it kind of thing that I think gets a lot of us excited about what the potential is. You know, you know, you've got a patient here that you had him meniscal tear then you, so you had attempted to repair. We know that about 15 to 22% of those fail the meniscal repairs. You know, it's a disappointing number. You know, we like things to be much higher than that. But that's what the, the facts are. That's what the, you know, larger scale studies have told us.

Speaker 3:          00:40:33       And to anybody that has a meniscal injury, that's a risk worth taking because if you know what it feels like to have a bucket handle tear and someone says, Hey, you have an 80% chance of success, you're like, I'm in man.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       Yeah, take it. We'll also for the, this is what we know, this is why we will take the risk. So for a young person that has the tear, you know, we want to preserve that meniscal tissue and for as long as their life as we can. So certainly you are willing to risk and even you sometimes might attempt to repair something that you think even has a lower chance just because they're young and you want to preserve that. Why you want to preserve it as we know that if you even resect a small amount of the meniscal tissue, like Sapta 25%, um, it will change the contact pressure in the knee. So they do these, you know, color pressure studies where it, it shows you the amount of, of force and its distribution. And with a normal meniscus, it's evenly distributed into the, you know, on the medial femoral condyles the end of the femur and the tibial plateau is

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       the top part of the Shin Bone. So when those come together with a normal meniscus in there, the pressure's, even if you resect part of that, now you see this point loading. So you see these hot spots where it's, there's a much greater amount of pr of pressure. Sort of like when you go to a restaurant and you're sitting at a table and it's wobbly and you have to stick a napkin under one of the legs. What about analogy? Maybe? Probably bad analogy. Not following you, but you don't, I'm talking about, I've done that. Eating is dump then. Yeah. And then the guy comes on, you kind of test the one leg a little higher. Yeah. A piece of a wedge under there. And I know what you're saying. Yeah. I don't know that it's not the best, if that makes sense for you. It doesn't, that's fine.

Speaker 1:          00:42:10       I tried, I swung and I missed. Let's continue. That's all right. But the point of this story is that we know if we cut part of that out, your cartilage is going to have some wear and tear over time. Now, whether or not you develop symptoms from that is hard to, it's hard to predict. Well, I'm pretty sure that that's what was going on with my knee because it, because it was uneven and the jarring action of kicking a heavy bag or kicking pads. So I think that what I was trying to get to, and I was taking the long path to get there was that, you know, in the past what we might've said is, Eh, you know, you had an acl tear, he had meniscus tear, you know, your niece crappy, sorry. Like you're going to have some pain, but in what are you trying to, what do you kickbox and for eight year age anyway, I've heard that this is, this would be the attitude, right?

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       Um, and really what that means is I'm uncomfortable because I don't have an easy solution for you. So I'm going to blame you for, there's also people wanting you to adopt their lifestyle or them to think that your lifestyle is foolhardy. There's definitely that. I just trying to find an easy solution so that you don't come back into the office and complain about something that we don't have an easy solution for. Also, I think they're trying to talk sense into you. That might be true to their mind. You know, like if you don't do martial arts and you see some knuckleheads out there, risk of having to come to my office, that's true. It's also you see someone who's doing this and hurting themselves and you tell them, hey look, you've got to stop doing that. You know, cause you think you're doing the right thing by telling them that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:37       Right. But you know, you're, you're essentially telling someone that all that stuff that makes you feel amazing, alleviates stress, builds confidence. It makes you, it's part of your soul. Yeah. It's a big part. Yeah. So how am I supposed to rip that away from me? For some people it becomes a real, I mean, obviously with certain injuries. Yeah. But, um, some people we have to have the hard discussion. It's like, yeah, I know you want to keep doing this. I know you think you're heading that direction, but this is over. Well when they do replacements now because uh, I know a guy who's got a knee replacement and one of the things he was saying actually I know quite a few people, one of them was on the podcast, his name is Dan Pena and he was saying that, uh, the problem is with his knees is they only been this way.

Speaker 1:          00:44:21       Now they don't move side to side. There's no lateral movement and the knee, like there's no wiggle room. He can't go side to side. Like the knee is just goes straight up and back like this artificial ne. Does that make sense? No, you're, you got skeptical hippo face. It depends on a lot of factors. Um, maybe for him, um, there may be other patients that don't have quite as much stiffness in their knee, but no one who gets a hip replacement is doing triathlons. They shouldn't be, or a knee replacement rather, they shouldn't be. Yeah. So it's limited with 100% certainty that implant will loosen and fall apart. Huh? Why can't they make a knee of fake knee that's as good as a real knee? Hmm. That's a long question. Are they lazy? I wouldn't think so. Certainly. Uh, certainly lots of motivation and uh, you know, an now, oh my God, if they could fix a Ni and turn a knee into a superior need to the need that you have now.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       So the, I mean, it's like an overall question, right? Why can you not a replace something better than you can repair it will wouldn't, wouldn't we want to be going more towards repair and renewal regeneration. We're hoping that we can figure something out for that. But that's what factors did. The knee replacement, you have a metal component that you're either, you know, cementing to the bone or you're, you know, applying it to the bone and having bony in growth into the implant. So there, there's an interface between that implant and the body and to come up with something that would never allow that to separate. I mean that's, you know, how would you do that? Yeah, I know a guy who had bone cancer. It's a really kind of a terrible story, but he lived near a golf course and the golf course used these horrible pesticides and it leaked into the ground water and all the people in his neighborhood got cancer, like a huge epidemic of cancer in his neighborhood and he got bone cancer and they replaced one of his femurs with a metal rod and uh, it causes him significant discomfort in some of those, in my training.

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       It's pretty gnarly. Swore. What's that about? Talk to me. Total femur. Yeah. It cut someone open like a fish and stick a new leg in there. Uh, you literally do, it's an incision about bat long. Whoa. He's making his arms about what the spreads your arm about four feet. Three feet. It's the entire length of however long your thighs she wow. Wow. Yeah. Okay. Snarly yeah, they all get infected. They do. It seems like it. Wow. Now Post op like right away or you mean in time time and just because your body is rejecting it, it doesn't know what to do with action. It's just you got this big hunk of metal and the up, um, bacteria forms, you know, this sort of slime layer that can't be, um, even with antibiotics, you know, blood can't get to the metal. So you formed this layer and then it's just once it's contaminated, you can't control it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:36       Whoa. So the metal on the leg, the fake leg just get slimy. Uh, not so much that it gets slimy. It's just the, the stuff that's produced by the bacteria adheres to the metal. Oh. So, and it's just so much metal in the body. There's so much opportunity. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. So what do you do when it gets infected? You gotta open them up again, clean it up. You do. You try by the end of the line is a invitation. The limb has to go, Whoa, Daddy. Jamie is Jamie almost threw up. Got An image. Pull it up. Hold it up. You don't come. You're a doctor. How dare you. How dare you say, don't pull it up. You're, this is what you do, man. That's what I'm feeling bad. And it's was right. I don't know where you're going to get the total femur.

Speaker 1:          00:48:26       What? Yeah. That's go large with that sir. I want to see that. I don't even, holy Jesus. Whoa my God. First of all, what am I looking at there? So that's the f the Femur, that's a metal femur. And the just google replaced Femur and look at the flags opened up there and you have to make measurements. And so it's basically a, a total knee and a total hip. And then all of the bone in between has been replaced with that metal. And then your foot's just attached to your regular Shin below it. Correct. And what does this normally used for? Like how often? What does this, uh, so that would be in the case of a infection and you know, there's the cases that we had were usually multiple fractures below a hip replacement and then, and then below a longer stem hip replacements.

Speaker 1:          00:49:20       Finally, you've got just no bone. Uh, the other reason would be infected bone that you had to resect and then still another reason would be in the case of tumor where you have to, you're doing limb salvage. Yeah. That was this gentleman's now that one above Jamie where it's got like they're spreading it apart afar. Yeah. Are there, what's going on there and what's all that stuff on the outside, that orange stuff. Oh, so, uh, that's called io band and it's a thin film that we cover over where we're making an incision in surgery is to help prevent infection. So we naturally have, you know, staff and other bacteria on the surface of the skin and you put this sticker cover on top of the skin and then anything that's around the wound is, is contained. It says play video. I think you should listen to him.

Speaker 1:          00:50:06       Click on that. Let's see what that is. Yeah, let's see who this is. Oh, it's just a picture of that that says that I could visit page, click play video and here we go. Ooh, I'm scared. I get nervous. Oh Daddy. Whoa boy. Ooh. Now that seems valley view surgery through incisions, like better about this big, yeah, a little tiny incisions. Now that seems odd because that seems like a very old person. Like I'm looking at the lack of muscle tissue, either very old or very unathletic. Uh, yeah. And um, this is like good evaluation. That's incredibly traumatic then. I mean, that's how does someone recover from that? It's slow now. Is there a potential use of stem cells in the case of like, is it, is it possible to regenerate a bone? I know they've built a woman, a artificial bladder through sympathetically bone is one of the tissues that is a part of that line of the Mesenchymal stem cells.

Speaker 1:          00:51:07       Right. That's what I'm saying is from the Misa Durham. So you think that could be something down the line that they could be able to accomplish there? I mean, replacing that femur and it's cartilage covering at the knee and the hip. I mean, I think that's at this point, um, uh, fantasy. Yeah, but isn't that one, but I said when, when if someone came up to the person that had the telegraph and said, Hey, do you think one day I'll be able to send Dick Pics from this thing? They're like, well right now that's the fantasy, right? Don't you think? Probably most likely, you know they would look at you like you're crazy person. Well when I was a, this is an embarrassing story to admit, but when I was about 13 I went next door to my neighbor's house and he was kind of a computer nerd at the time.

Speaker 1:          00:51:51       But you know computer nerds at the time or playing with like commodore 64 right? And he's like, dude look at this. I can hook my computer up to the phone and I can type on the screen in my friend down the street. We'll see what I wrote. And I was like, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Dude, can we like go play football? He talking about, so apparently not very forward thinking guy. Cause obviously we're doing that quite a bit now. I had a showtime special in 2005 and Netflix special actually that eventually wound up on showtime. But I had a joke in there about cell phones, um, about people sending you a text message and the part of the joke was like, it takes you four presses to get an S. Right? Like why don't you just call me? Because like it was before anybody had figured out.

Speaker 1:          00:52:40       Right. We'll keyboard and I'm like, why are you making me read like this is so stupid. I thought it was just like a dumb trend that was going to go away. And now if someone calls me I will fuck you. Call me for, yeah. It's very strange what's happened in just 12 years. Yeah. It's a chill little shift in how we communicate with people. Right. A massive one. I mean how uh, how disruptive to your life is it to have to like send emails now? I mean to sit down and like type and eat like email, respond back. Some emails you like, people email me with like a bunch of questions. It's a big chore. It's like homework, I got to sit down and it takes a lot of time. Whereas, you know, a text is like a quick response like, hey, why don't I just, I'm so used email, I send

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       a lot of emails. I have so much email. I mean, well I do all the booking for this show too. I mean, while I have a guy, Matt stags who contacts people, but I reached out to a lot of people as well. So like a lot of the booking and the different things that I do, I contact people and you know, the best way to do it is through an email. It's like, Hey, you know, I would really love to talk to you about this or that. I have a question about that brief emails. I would bet sometimes, yeah, but I've gone, I've, I've had some, yeah, that's the problem is the volume, the sheer volume I get is just unmanageable to the point where people think I'm ignoring them. I'm like, man, I'm not ignoring you. I didn't even see it. It just got lost in the tsunami of emails that came in.

Speaker 3:          00:54:06       Like, if I go on vacation, I hardly communicate. I barely do anything. Maybe I'll put up a social media post and you know, just just to like, cause it's kind of a part of the job. Right. But I don't pay attention to the emails. I just leave him alone and then I get home and I'll go, oh my God, there's 2000 emails. I'll have 2000 emails in a few days. I don't know. I'm not exaggerating. Do you go through all this? I do my best. Try to. I look for my friends. Yeah. You know, I look for people that are important and uh, look for, uh, acquaintances that I like and you know, work related stuff. Yeah. But it's a mess. I have several email accounts to which helps, like people that are important to me get the big one. You know, you don't get, you don't get the patent on it.

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       Don't worry about it. I like you. I don't think, I don't want to, don't. If you do, I'll give you the real one. I just want to let you know, you won't tell anybody. People don't like to be on the outside. You tell him about that and they're like, which one way up, bro? Yeah. Alright. Why worry about it man? What list of mine? Why worry about it, man? Yeah. Yeah. But if you have to ask the question, yeah, it's not good. I wonder when it's going to pass what we're doing. I mean, when it's not going to be this, it's not going to be typing like what's the next thing is, uh, you know, it's, it's definitely not going to be videos where you force people to watch. The beautiful thing about an emails, I can kind of scan it through. What's this guy saying not interested.

Speaker 3:          00:55:27       Next, have you messed around with a like dragon dictation? Yes. Yes. It's amazing for notes when you're in a car or when I'm, if I have an idea in my head and there's no way I could type it on my phone that quickly. Have you ever seen how good it works? It's, no, it's very good. Yeah. No, we'll just, what comes back? The most recent, uh, versions of it? Yeah. Like this right here. Check this out, doctor. Rati Mcgee is an amazing human being. He has fresh breath and his hair is wonderful. Oh, look at that. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah, 100%. That's incredible. That's pretty good. I mean it is, it really is incredible. And you can do that in your car if you have an idea. So you're not some asshole is texting because sometimes like neal, Neal Brennan had the best analogy for it. You know, Neal Brennan is standup comedian, Co creator of the Chappelle show.

Speaker 3:          00:56:20       He had the best analogy. He goes, my notebook is essentially like a net for catching ideas. Yeah. And you've got to catch those ideas as quick as you can. I'm sure that's a good way of looking at it. So like if you're, if I'm in a car and I have an idea, I'm like, oh my God, I got to get this out before I forget. So I start repeating it to myself. And then if I'm at a red light or something on press that record button, very responsible of you. Um, I'm very responsible when it comes to texting and driving. That's good. Um, I just, I think that is one of the most infuriating things. That's fucking terrible. Yeah. It's like you're going 60 plus whatever miles an hour. The amount of distance that you cover in a glance where you are not looking at the road and things can happen at any moment. Just to me it's super disturbing. Yeah. Anyway, back to the back to the grind. Um, what did, what do you got there that you would like to?

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       Sure. Well, um, so you know, okay, so we touched a little bit about, about, you know, all of the, all of the elements of the care of the person, right? So it's, it has to be more than just giving you a shot and send you on your way, right? If you truly have an injury and we're trying to recover you, then what also comes along with that is the appropriate rehab protocol. And none of those are defined yet for, for what some of these things that we've done. Um, but we're trying to develop that and dial it in and hone it down. For me, for me right now, the easiest thing is to try to adapt it from a surgical rehab. Um, and I'm not a physical therapist obviously, so I tried to collaborate with those guys and girls that are smarter than me in that, uh, avenue.

Speaker 2:          00:57:59       But the principles are the same, right? So you have, you have an injury that you're trying to heal. Now, in some cases it's, you know, we've created the injury or we've done the thing that the patient has to recover from. In the case of an injection, you have an injury. If you've done the injection and now we need the effect to happen, whatever it is that we're hoping that we'll be. So, but then you can't ignore the fact that if somebody has a bad shoulder, we'll, maybe we may decrease the pain, but if they, if they're, if their motion is poor, if their strength is poor, if it's not functioning correctly, then how can we be achieving the best result if we're not also attending to that? Right? So it's a multi step, no doubt. And then in the more that we're learning about all these other factors, I mean, like again for you, I mean, you're paying attention to your sleep, you're paying attention to your nutrition, you're on, uh, you know, a variety of supplements that are meant to help a lot of these processes. And I think we're going to get better and better at it. And that has got to be pretty critical as well. Right? It's got to be hugely important, especially like staying away from inflammation. Enhancing foods are inflammatory foods. Yeah, no doubt. So, um, yeah, I think it's gotta be critically important and we try to share that information with people. There's,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       um, for athletes, uh, like a website that you could pull up and we can share as the college and Professional Athlete, a dietetics association, I think it is college in professional college and professional athlete. I was like, what college and professional athletes, and I don't even know what that means. We all have Collagen, right? College hand. Yeah. So these guys have some great information and good infographics that, um, that we utilize. You know, since I'm not a, that looks good. I'm not a dietician, so I have to rely again on people that have good information. I think these guys have a good, reliable, they're good reliable source and uh, they've got great infographics if you go to,

Speaker 4:          01:00:07       mmm.

Speaker 5:          01:00:14       Uh

Speaker 1:          01:00:19       hmm. Educational Resources. There you go. Yeah. So this will pull up some, some different things, balancing extra exercise, induced inflammation. Now here's a good question. Um, because uh, it's pretty much universally agreed that rest, ice, compression, elevation, all those different things that people have said in the past, there is benefit to a particular icing things. But yeah, there's, there's a lot of debate, right? There's some debate now. Certainly there's like a definite, uh, anti ice community. Yeah. What is that out there? Do you think it's legit? Well, there can't, there's not a downside to it. I mean, to ice. I don't think so. I mean, we've used it regularly and so I don't know. There's, there's definitely a group that, um, and I don't know all of their arguments against, but may should take the former UFC bantamweight champion. She had had a podcast with this guy who was the anti ice guy. Yeah. I got this whole thing. See a flat earth guy to no, but he doesn't believe in dinosaurs I made is not, no, I made that up. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       I don't know. I mean, so you, I believe he's a doctor, but he, you know, he might be a fucking veterinary works on no cat infections or something. I don't know. But I don't think there's a downscaling about that too. So in my opinion, you know, I've definitely had athletic injuries. Um, I was a pitcher previously. We routinely ice our shoulder and elbow after pitching. Um, I did it as a matter of routine and may, it felt good. It felt better when I did it and I didn't. But here's the question. It felt good at the time, but it is that feeling good in any way. Slowing the healing process.

Speaker 4:          01:01:58       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:02:00       Hard to know. I mean, that's where it gets weird, right? Yeah. I don't know. To be frank. God Damn it. I like it. No, you're the, you're the fucking genius, Dr. Guy of you don't know we're doomed. They get back to me. So, uh, what, I'll get you some good information. It thank you. Appreciate

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       it. What else you got here? Um, so I think one of the interesting things about this whole topic, um, and the possibility of healing from utilizing this type of treatment, um, is how it allows you to go through the process of healing without this fibro vascular response. So the typical healing cascade has an inflammatory phase, proliferative phase and the maturation phase. So in the inflammatory phase, you have neutrophils and white blood cells and these enzymes that are present that are trying to start the process. Then in the proliferative phase, you're having what's called angiogenesis and that means the development of new blood vessels and vasculature to the area. Um, and your body's producing fiber blasts and you're laying down tissue in this sort of haphazard manner. So it's just kind of piling on in there. Um, and then the maturation phase is when you have remodeling.

Speaker 2:          01:03:27       So those, that scar tissue is changing over time and, and developing into a tissue that's more like, or is the native tissue. So that occurs over a period of time. And then a lot of times during that process, before you're fully matured in the healing, you're backed activities. Um, the best. So let's just take an example. Like when you sprain your ankle and then you, you know, you start feeling better and maybe you go back to basketball within a couple of weeks. At that point, if you've actually torn one of the ankle ligaments, you don't have native ligament tissue. That's the same structural properties. It's not as strong. I mean, you might be developing the strength around it, but it's not like the native tissue. Now the hope is that we can demonstrate now we know that this is the science. This is what it's supposed to do.

Speaker 2:          01:04:21       This is what it does in the developing fetus. We see it in kids. You know how, you know when your, your daughter was real young, she scratched her face, the healing it will ring. It was like gone like the next day. Um, so healing without scar is you know, has to do with not forming this, these fiber, this fiber blast or fiber vascular response and in fiber optic phase. Now what the cool potential of this to me is if we can skip that and we can have more complete healing and quicker resolution to the native tissue, then you're going to have those, the same properties, you're going to be stronger, you're going to be better, you know, technically and hopefully you know, clinically this pans out that you would be more resistant and lower risk for repeat injury because that's really our goal is in treating patients is get them back to their activity and decrease the chance that they have to miss more time.

Speaker 2:          01:05:21       How do you know how much to inject into, nobody knows, oh Jesus. Nobody knows that. This is one of the big questions that that will be discovered with again, you know, rigorous studies where we can look at, you know, what should the dosing be, what should the frequency of the treatment be and what should these, the protocols before and after be a, it's not defined in anybody. That's telling a patient that they have exactly what it should be. I mean, be wary of that because that has not been discovered yet. So trying to, we're trying to take, you know, we're taking the information from our experience and applying it that way. It's, it's not the, it's not the best way to go about this and it, it's one of the things that prp suffered from is that all of the things everybody was using it for so many different things and, and just kind of hoping that it was the magic bullet that it was going to treat all the things that we had difficulty treating.

Speaker 2:          01:06:15       Um, and even all of the studies that were coming out, you know, people were using different centrifuges and applying it for different reasons, different protocols was just a mishmash of information. It wasn't valuable. How d how does platelet rich plasma will work? So it has growth factors and cytokines and the, um, the, the platelets release proteins and things and those things help mediate that inflammatory response and help the healing process. I mean, that's kind of the basics. Do you think that they could work in a symbiotic fashion with like this information that adding prp to, uh, some cellular treatment like bone marrow fat or the placental tissue, uh, and that line of treatment can help expand the cells. Ooh. So that gets us to an important point, which is, uh, expanding the cells has been done and is not currently legal in the United States. So there was a place, and they do it in other countries, but here if you, if you more than men, this is a mouthful.

Speaker 2:          01:07:22       If you more than minimally manipulate the tissue, then that is not under the guidelines of the FDA for use of human cellular tissue products. So they were taking, for example, bone marrow and plating it and growing more sales, bringing the patients back two weeks later and injecting them with this, you know, super production of cells, which probably is great, but we don't know. We don't know if that's safe. And, and that has to be, you know, that has to be taken through the appropriate process. So, so you can't necessarily recommend someone taking prp while they're taking some sort of a stem cell injections. So here's the difference of that. A manufacturer can't say that we have a product that is a combined prp stem cell injection. Right? And it does this right. That's illegal. But if you're a patient we can't put on my website, I have the magic potion.

Speaker 2:          01:08:25       It's PRP and amniotic fluid and tissue. I just inject it and it can heal anything. I admire how responsible you are and how you keep cutting me off whenever I was suggesting some ridiculous thing. But is would there be a benefit for a patient potential benefit who's getting stem cell injections and also gets prp at the same time? Or is it just theoretical? Its theoretical right now. Yeah. But potentially, definitely. Uh, there's potential and it's encouraging to, you know, that the possibility is there. It appears to be safe there. You know, we don't have adverse reactions to it. Um, and so, and the point that I wanted to make is that a physician can prescribe something and use it off label. Right? So the FDA doesn't regulate the practice of medicine. I can do that in my office, but I can't make claims about it and I can't put it on social media and on my website and say, if I'm going to do this and I'm going to fix your shoulder, like come here if you have a meniscus tear, cause we do this injection and it's gonna make you better.

Speaker 2:          01:09:38       That's illegal. That's, I understand. So, but I, if somebody comes to my office, you know, I can elect to do that because both things are available. Um, they have, we have permission, you know, to use them, but we're using it off label and I understand. So, um, when you say maximize cells, that's the term used maybe. What does the term used about prp in, in conjunction think that it can increase. The proliferation of them is income. Stem cell. Oh, how much of a time period would it have to be between the injection and the PRP? That's undefined again. So what would you assume? The way that, the way that we're doing is we would do the injection at the same time. Uh, so yeah, putting it in there together. So you really only have a narrow window from when we take those frozen cells and then we thaw them, you know, we have a short window when we can then inject them and then there's, you know, maybe between seven and 21 days that those cells are viable in your shoulder or your knee or wherever we inject it.

Speaker 2:          01:10:37       So if someone gets an injection that does PRP, they would have to essentially get that done within those seven to 21 days to have some sort of a benefit of what you're saying theoretically radicals that yeah, that, that's uh, that's how I would do it currently. Uh, based on that information. It's fascinating stuff. Yeah. What else you got there? Well, so, um, we just, I thought it was important to talk about the, it's called section three 61 of the Public Health Service Act. And this is the definition from the FDA on the use of human cell tissue and cellular tissue products. So it has to match these criteria. So you have to have minimal manipulation. That means you can't add things to it. You can't combine it with other stuff, you can't. Um, like I was saying, you can't, you know, put it in the lab and grow it and add things to it and then come bring the patient back and treat them how this isn't part of the, um, part of it, but we, you can't treat patients on a, on a different day.

Speaker 2:          01:11:37       It has to be at the same time whenever you're harvesting the cells or utilizing whatever it is you're using, um, it has to be something called homologous use. And what that means is whatever tissue you're taking has to have the intention of the purpose of that tissue for when you put it into somebody's body. So for example, uh, if I have, uh, if you have a fracture that's not healing and I take a bone graft product, so cadaver bone, and we're going to use that to help heal your fracture, that hasn't healed. That is, that's homologous use we have, we're taking bone, we're using it to become bone or to be the scaffold for bone to heal and grow. So, um, it can't be combined with something else and it can't have, it can't be intended to have a systemic effect. So now all of these things that I'm explaining, these are rules for manufacturers and what they can, what the rules are for them to be able to market their product. So for example, you can't take amniotic fluid and say this is a product meant for IV infusion for treatment of whatever diabetes.

Speaker 1:          01:12:53       Right? And that is something that people do in other countries, right? They're doing in other countries, you can do that in, you technically can't do that. You can't manufacture a product and put that on the labeling that that's what it's intended for. But do they do that in America? I, ve stem cells, I've been told by patients that they've gone to places that have suggested to them that that was going to be the treatment. Right. And what is, what is going on there? I'm not aware of it. What, how does that even work? Do you know? It's not your wheelhouse. No, but, and nobody knows if it does. So it was just experimental. It is. I mean all of this, you know, boss ruin is former UFC champion. Do you ever treat him? I have no law to say that. Um, uh, something I can say talk about any patient that unless they tell me, okay, set it or they're sitting in front of me talking about it and okay, I'll give you permission. It's that it's hipaa violation. Just want a nation state for the record. I give you permission. Um, bas and went to, where did he said he'd go to Peru or something like that. Went to the jungle, some dude kill the chicken and then showed some stem cells into him, but a blood vein. He was saying it was fucking amazing if you, you know, you were to wait boss talks. He's like, it's like the energy was coming out of my body. Like Ah, he said that. He literally felt like, like

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       some guy of Kung Fu and we'll be where energy was like shooting off his fingertips. He said it was amazing. Like the emperor, he's not the only guy that said that. You know Dan Bilzerian, do you know Dan Bilzerian is the instagram guy with the boobs and the butts? Uh, he told me the same thing. He said that when he got it done, he said it's amazing. He goes to Mexico to get it done. Not recommended, but he can't talk about it off air. He'll be a little chatter box. Just you wait maybe, well, what I'm interested in, in what I was thinking for you threw me off there. Um, is, is he going to with a specific intent of treating something or is he just like looking for the Fountain of Youth? Um, I think he fucks so much. He doesn't have any sperm in his body and he's trying to kicks, I dunno.

Speaker 3:          01:15:07       Yeah, that guy's an animal. But uh, I think he's got a series of injuries. I know that because he's had regena keen for his neck. He put it up on a, on instagram, like with instagram stories. He was videoing himself while I was getting injections in his neck, which I've had a Regena keen interjections. Yes. It cured my cervical disc bulge. Yeah. Yeah. That and disco decompression, a spinal decompression, you know with like a harness where they're pulling on your neck that I had a bulging disc in my neck that was pushing on my unresolved. Yeah, completely resolved. Like on an MRI. It doesn't exist anymore where I was getting numb hands cause the Ulnar nerve was being pressed upon. Yeah. Huh. Yeah it works. Some massive anti inflammation properties. I just don't think that it has the same healing potential. It seems like it reduces inflammation in a giant way.

Speaker 3:          01:15:59       What's going on with, um, by the way, I had regena keen shot in my knee too. It didn't really show me. So they didn't really have the same effect. This is a little bit, so patients like yourself that have had a number of injuries and a number of treatments. And one of the things that's got me enthusiastic about the potential of all of this is when somebody tells me, look, I've had this, this, this and this. And then I had this, what we're talking about and that it was just completely different game changing, just a hundred percent captured and different. Look. Mine right shoulder is not 100% but it might be 90%. You know, and it's strong as fuck. Like I could do a lot of shit with it. Like it doesn't do some insane stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it doesn't bog things that I probably wouldn't recommend, but no pain.

Speaker 3:          01:16:48       Let go. I can, why could do, um, I take these 90 pound kettle bells and I do windmills with them. Where you, you know, you're pressing overhead, you know what a windmill is dropping down. Like that's what your shoulders rotating. I don't do that with 90 pounds, but I know what it is. But the, um, the fact that I can do that with a shoulder that was on the way probably to getting on it was just amazing. My bow tie, the most impressive thing was that push up with the wheel thing. What's that thing called? Oh, the AB wheel. Now it's like a little roller that you had your hand. Yeah. Those things when you go for, what's that called? The comfort of all havoc creates it. There's sliders, havoc. Sliders. Okay. Uh, amy, that was like, why k sliders? There's a video of it on seat.

Speaker 3:          01:17:32       There's a video on my instagram, Jamie, um, from quite a while ago, but it was posts post, excuse me, uh, injection. Um, it's from way back. I want to say at least a year ago I was doing that. But um, yeah, there's my range of motion's 100%. I mean, at the most it's uncomfortable in certain things, but for a big one for me was archery because um, you know, I really enjoy it. I do it all the time and it's very meditative to me and I, I just, I love archery. So for me, like the idea of not being able to pull my bow back, I was, it was really disturbing. I was like, Gosh, I'm going to have to get the surgery done. Yeah, you've been pretty committed to it for a while. Now I, I'll shoot a hundred plus hours a day and I'm pulling back 84 pounds to 84 pound compound bow and I'm shooting it a hundred times a day and there's no pain.

Speaker 3:          01:18:26       I did it yesterday. All I'll look for hours. Me and my friend Cam Haynes who, you know, you met who came to talk to you as well. Um, you kind of indirectly got me, uh, into it. I don't know if I went to archery through John. John Dudley. Yeah. Yeah. I know you're shooting all the time now, right? Yeah. So John got me this unbelievable, you know, horror, Hawaii, uh, carbon spider bow. It's like a, if you want it, if you want to see, uh, any of my friends, like make the greatest faces you've ever seen. I just, I pull this thing out and it's like, you know, some space, age weapon, it looks like a bow. The Batman would have, yeah, yeah. She bug out. Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. I would say Batman, but yeah. But yeah, it's um, those bows or they're amazing. It's incredible.

Speaker 3:          01:19:17       And it's uh, yeah, I've only been able to go a couple of times, but I'm definitely hooked. It's the most amazing meditation. I love it. It's cause it's you, when you're focusing on that shot, you literally have no room for anything else. It's, it requires so much concentration. You're concentrating on the front hand position, front shoulder position, where, where the string touches the tip of your nose, the corner of your mouth. And John is just an amazing coach. So, you know, totally unfair. I get, that's the bow. Then the first bow that I get to shoot with, and then John gives me the first lesson that I've ever pulled a back. He's standing there right with me. He's an Olympic coach by the way. He used to coach to the Olympic team and he's amazing. Yeah. I mean he really, he's a great guy too. And he can take years off of people's learning. I mean he's, he's absolutely taking years off my learning curve. Yeah. I'm going to sneeze. I hate when you say you're going to sneeze and they put a lot of pressure on yourself and you're like, man, I'm, I might not, it might just look like a Weirdo for a few minutes. Did you find that video? No, it's in there. I swear to God. So here's another, uh, kind of crazy thing about the, the placental derived treatments

Speaker 2:          01:20:39       is it they actually have a antimicrobial properties. Whoa. So this is crazy. I mean we kind of know this, um, you know, one of the functions of the amniotic membrane is to protect the, the developing baby. Right? But, um, in, in one of the things it does protect it from infection, boy, they were able to demonstrate was that, um, when they, they've actually introduced bacteria, like literally injected bacteria onto these membranes and then they come back and, and check and it, it, it has destroyed the bacteria so. Huh. So ability to, um, resist scar formation, move through the, the fibrotic phase of healing and then also the antimicrobial profit.

Speaker 3:          01:21:29       So amazing. That would be super beneficial. Postsurgery right. Cause that's a giant issue. Staph infections and the like.

Speaker 2:          01:21:36       It's one of the things that you know, frightens us most about, you know, doing our procedures is, you know, can we prevent infection? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:21:45       Giant issue where people, I mean I know because of the nature of a martial arts, it just, everybody I know is that surgery. Yeah, that's pretty much. And the big issue is post in post surgery infections. Yeah. Oh those guys are, they're getting abrasions and everything like that on the mat. And then so then they're colonized with, you know, Mrse out of whatever funk is in that gym. I tell everybody, if you are a grappler, this is super important. I want you to look up defense soap. Defense soap is a soap company that was created by my friend Guy Sacco. And what is it? It is all natural soap that promotes healthy bacteria. It doesn't destroy the healthy bacteria. Hmm. But it's all tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil. This shit is amazing. And I used to get, I've gotten staff at least twice. I used to get ringworm all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:22:41       Well, not all the time, but I got a couple of times and until I was like super diligent about wool washing myself, like immediately afterwards. But once I started using two things, probiotics, which is huge. Um, acidophilus. Yeah. Eating yogurt and a drinking Kombucha. And then the next one in fact soap probably not, but it's a little bit of something and it's a little bit of something. I think it's good to have. It's good to have. Um, probiotics. I like Kimchi. I tried to take my probiotic probiotics and multiple forms. Um, this stuff that I was drinking when he got here. Kombucha. I love this stuff. I drink all the time. Or that you like or did he met mixing you gotta be careful because I'm a low sugar guy, so like the grapes, there's some of them that are delicious, but they have a lot of sugar.

Speaker 3:          01:23:27       Sure. This, this multigrains does not have a lot of sugar. I don't want to see what it's got. I think it's something like 10 grams per serving or something like that. It's really, that sounds high. I think I've seen them lower. Oh two. Yeah. Two grams. So yeah, that's what you want the grapes high grape is, but the taste wonderful and write essays. Yummy. That's a problem. This does not taste so good. But you know you're getting something good in it. And this is the fight your way through it. The important stuff is that you get the strong Kombucha. This is the brand that I really liked. I don't work for them. They're not a sponsor. GTS, Kombucha, gt gts. Um, this stuff is awesome but you have to be over 21 because it has more than one half of 1% alcohol by volume because the fermentation process, cause it's so strong.

Speaker 3:          01:24:14       I see. So they make you get, you show your Id. Interesting. They actually pulled it from whole foods. I don't know if you know this. I thought, see, I thought I saw, that's where I've seen it. Yeah, they have it back. But they pulled it from whole foods until whole foods had to like put some regulations in place to keep, you would literally, if you were eight years old do, you could drink one and not get drunk. I mean, it's not like, it's not like you're going to get drunk off of it, but just due to regulations, you have to listen to the law. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          01:24:42       What else? You got got a lot of papers there, buddy. Got Drawings and shit. Charts and graphs. Have to think about probably a bunch of stuff you say. Don't let joe talk about this. Um, what other questions have you come up with along the way? Or One big question I wanted to talk to you about was something that I had a discussion with Dr. Davidson about recently. Um, and Jeff was telling me that the most recent procedure with stem cells is injecting them directly into the discs for people that have degenerative disc disease. And that there's some really promising results.

Speaker 2:          01:25:22       I've heard anecdotally of a number of, uh, very positive outcomes, uh, with treatment like that. Hmm. But that's amazing. Again, we, you know, it's still too early, so a lot is surely enough conservative about this are really, really, really do appreciate that. Although I'm giving you a hard time, I feel you when you hustled. I've really wrestled with it because, uh, you know, again, our whole training is based on, you know, we need to do things that have an evidence base for our patients. I mean, this is kind of the, the foundation of what we do. And so, but we're in a unique situation, so we have patients that, um, one week this stuff is available and it's legal to do and it's there and people know about it now. So they, they're seeking the information, they come to us. And even, you know, even before we started talking about it, you know, it started to be like here and there and then all of a sudden it's like two, three patients a day.

Speaker 2:          01:26:21       Now even more are saying, well, what about, what about stem cells should, can I have stem cell? And, uh, like, okay, well I'm going to have to back up and like have the whole discussion. Like, okay, well let's talk about what that is and what may be it can do. And, um, so people are seeking the treatment. It's available. Um, but we don't know and we don't have a lot of information. So we just have to be forthcoming and say, look, this is experimental. We've had encouraging early results. I can tell you anecdotal stuff. We've even seen images where somebody had, you know, full thickness rotator cuff tear eight months later, what looked like a healed rotator cuff on an MRI. Now, did that happen on its own? Well, we know that that happens at a lower percentage, but it is possible to heal. It's just a lower percentage.

Speaker 2:          01:27:09       Um, did it happen because of the treatment, you know, that hasn't been established. So I have to really explain all that. And the other category to that, uh, patients will come in and they'll explain an injury and, and I've had to turn away a lot of people that were, they were fully ready to come in and have treatment and, and they were fine with paying out of pocket because of course, it's not covered by insurance because it's experimental because there's, you know, no data yet. And that's not true. There's not no data, but there's, there's not enough data to support treatment for certain, uh, conditions. Um, but you know, I've had to tell people I don't think this is appropriate even even to try even if you want this. Um, and usually the category is, excuse me if it's something mechanical. So I think this makes intuitive sense to people.

Speaker 2:          01:28:04       So for example, had you come to me and you said, hey, uh, you know, I dislocated my shoulder seven times and uh, can you just put an injection in their will? The, the problem with that is that the, in that case, in this example, the ligaments of the shoulder had been stretched and disrupted. And in the case of a dislocation, there's oftentimes a labral tear that comes with that. Now, I don't believe in, I could be proven wrong over time, but I just don't believe that that an injection on its own would magically decreased the volume of the capsule. You know, tightened the static structures in the shoulder and resolve the pain for that patient now. But those right there was in my head. Sure. I believe there was something that came up a few years ago where they were doing something where they're heating up the insulation or capsule and shrink the normal capsulorrhaphy.

Speaker 2:          01:28:58       What does that was very popular for you was, yeah, now it's close to malpractice. Oh, Jesus. Yeah. So it's interesting though, the way these things go. So there was a huge wave of, um, interest in this. And essentially what guys would do is they're looking inside the shoulder. You have a radio frequency wand and you're using that to heat the tissue and you can watch it literally shrink in front of you. And then Richard Hawkins is a very accomplished orthopedic surgeon, kind of iconic guy that's done tons of research. He was also went in Vail, Colorado, now in Carolina, and he published a paper that, that showed a very high rate of failure from these procedures. And so as a result of that, um, it's fallen out of favor. So yeah. But it was done very frequently on lots and lots of shoulders, a high rate of failure.

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       It was like 40%. Okay. But here's the question, is that because you're, you're talking about already compromised joints, right? Which is a very complicated joint. The shoulder is very complicated. So there's certainly a number of reasons why that could have failed. But, uh, there was a lot of problems with, uh, basically damage to the tissue from the radio frequency. Oh, so it was weakening things? Yeah, I say yeah. So that, that what was the benefit of it? Well, you could watch it and you were seeing the decrease in the volume of the capsule. So you are where structures had become loose. You were seeing it become tight in at the time zero period. What about doing that in conjunction with some sort of a stem cell therapy? Um, does that make sense? Yeah. It must be a doctor. Right? You're very close. You know, you're only a 10 years in school.

Speaker 2:          01:30:47       The only 14 years away. 14. Yeah, that's all 14 for regular people. Give me 20. Um, so, so why did they think that it would work in the first place? Like what, what was the, uh, the idea behind there? There's, there's early published papers that were saying that the outcomes were better if you used it. Wow. So it's, it's murky. I mean there's things that over time we discover that what we thought we were looking at, you know, we didn't fully understand. And how long did it take before it became malpractice or that problem and exaggerated term problematic? Um, I, I don't know the exact year that his paper was published, but it was, um, it was before my residency training. I started, I graduated medical school in 2006 so it was before that that people weren't doing that anymore. Okay. So I'll bring it back around.

Speaker 2:          01:31:35       So when someone has had, like if you talk to some due to play football or something, had multiple shoulder dislocations, like what would you do to, when you would encourage surgery? Um, so the, you know, the typical course for recurrent instability of the shoulder would be a stabilization procedure. Now a lot of that's based on the exam and what you see on imaging. Some people can do well with a simple shoulder arthroscopy and then you pass a couple stitches, you repair the labor from, you can tighten the capsule at the same time. And young patients progressed really well through that. Um, when there is, you know, more complicated problems such as the, there's bone loss on the front of the socket. So when you have a dislocation, the head goes forward. It, it goes out the front. That's the typical and anterior shoulder dislocation is the usual one. And then as it tries to come back into place, the head bangs into the glenoid or the socket. So you can, you'll tear the front of the Labor. I'm, you'll stretch the front of the capsule, but then you can also get a dent in the back of the humeral head. So the correct procedure,

Speaker 1:          01:32:52       um, I, I keep throwing you off track, but when someone does have a shoulder dislocation, what are you supposed to do? He supposed to pull on it and just take him to the hospital.

Speaker 2:          01:33:00       Um, there's probably no harm in doing that. There's, there's a great technique called the Zahiri technique. Spell it. Z, a, H I, R I and it's just the name of the guy that wrote the paper. Um, but it's essentially, it would be a really easy thing for you learn cause it's kind of a leverage thing. Yeah. So it's a way to, um, leverage the, the arm so that you can get the muscles to relax. It's easy on the person and you can actually do it awake and like at the field. So I actually did it on a, uh, uh, professional steer wrestler, um, at the Rodeo.

Speaker 1:          01:33:42       How hilarious is it that you can be a professional steer wrestler like the Seattle Sandwich

Speaker 2:          01:33:48       for a few years, but yeah, no, there, there's, they're pretty serious about stuff. Super serious. You were talking about you're a bucket handle meniscus. The first Rodeo cowboy that I took care of had a flipped bucket handle meniscus tear, and he came in the, the day that the national finals Rodeo was starting and he was also a steer wrestler by the way. And had been a previous, I think he was a champ or he, he won a bunch, that's for sure. Um, so they basically, they taped his knee. You got to come closer. They taped his knee, you know, in about 30 degrees of flection and he competed the whole nine days.

Speaker 1:          01:34:25       Whoa. Just roped up knee. Just taped it up, got on his horse and was jumping off and throwing 600 pounds steers on the ground. Forest. Yeah. Those guys are crazy. I want to see stuff on TV. I've never even been to one live because I'm terrified. You need to come to, I don't, we did an episode of fear factor. We may people ride bulls made him write it. That's, that's you can die. I mean that's not, it's dying no matter what. You're dealing with a goddamn steer. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. You can die. Getting on top of the stairs is not a yielded. Right. We had bowls steer wrestling is different. Right. Steer wrestling is the, they grab him. They take off. Yeah. You wrote here and the guy and the horse take off at the same time. You jump off, you grab it, you grab it by the horns and turn its neck and throw it in the ground and then they wrapped it.

Speaker 1:          01:35:13       Yeah. See with steer is a bull that doesn't have any balls, right? Yeah, that polls. But the same animal, they're younger than the ones that they cop. They chopped their balls off before they get a chance to mature. That's why when they, they rules are terrifying. So, and write down next to the bucking chute and it's like frightening actually had a clot of dirt. Get one of them kicked it up and it hit me in the head like a baseball. I mean, yeah. See they're a little babies and they have no balls. So this guy jumps off. What? Uh, and you tell him that is so whack. What a stupid fucking thing to be excited about these ideas.

Speaker 6:          01:35:50       I'm going to ask what of that thing I was trying to get away. I grab him by his natural handles and I'd tuck them down. Look how quick,

Speaker 1:          01:35:57       look at their move. It's like a darce choke and the cows like, what in the fuck man, why is this even happening? Look, the cows like what is going on? I got to get out here and look how they always do it the same way too. They do. It's it's, it's similar to like a a chokehold. Yeah. Oh, what a dumb fucking thing to be excited about the neck and flip them on their backs. Not It's outside of your world, but I'll tell you outside of the world, these are some of the nicest guys I've ever met in my life, honestly, and there are some of the toughest athletes. Oh yeah. I would imagine those guys are tough as hell. You have to be, they got to do it on fearful pete through every injury. There is no injury that they don't, that they won't compete.

Speaker 1:          01:36:36       You're always broken up. I mean, you have to. We have to do it on food. Also. They've had nine don't make money if they're not competing, so right. We have to do it on fear factor was a steer champion or a Rodeo champion rather. He had nine shoulder surgeries, his shoulder was just like sliced all open and he, I don't know how long off it has a dislocated, he goes, get me anytime I could open up a car door, it will pop out of socket. I'm like, yikes. Yeah, it's bad. Yeah. Um, so back around to where we're at. What, um, what do you do? How does this xy here technique? Can you describe it? That I say right is that hearing Tahirih Erie techniques. So that one of the guys that we trained with a in are my sports medicine program and Alabama showed us this and um, it was like one of the first things that we reviewed at the beginning of the year. And uh, so basically you have the person lying flat on their back and I would hold your wrist and then I loop my arm under your arm and then grab onto mine for leverage. And then I literally just sort of lean back and I'm using the muscles in my back so I'm not pulling with my arms. So a small person can do this on a very big athlete and you're fine because you're, you're using all of the strongest muscles in your body, right? So you literally just

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       lean back and you hold traction in that position. So you've got the arm is positioned like this. Yeah. You got to describe to people that are listening. Uh, the arm is in front of the person, uh, while they're laying, laying on their back. And again, I have my right hand on your right wrist. If it's a right shoulder dislocation,

Speaker 3:          01:38:14       well, let's just see a video. You got to, you got a video of it. It's really hard to find him, but I'm going to hopefully guests that this is maybe it, hopefully. Yeah. Okay. Let me explain to people at home what this is like as if you were trying to give someone an armbar. You, it's, you get a hook on the left side and so the hook is a, your left, if you're trying to arm bar someone on the right, the right arm, and you were inside control, you would hook it with your left arm and then you would trap it in place. And what a person does when they don't want to get arm barred, their defense is this, they grabbed their hands together and so you loop your arm in that and pull it back like that. So that'd be real similar what you're doing, you're using the left arm, you're kind of connecting it like this and then you're, you're actually just using traction. Yeah. So the, the treater in this case on the right side,

Speaker 2:          01:39:03       he just going to lean back and hold and you just wait and in about 10 seconds pops in place, the deltoid and the pack and the biceps relax and it just slides in. Oh, that's interesting. And you can actually do that. And I mean the kinder way to do this as you know, with some anesthesia, but a lot of times you can do that and they're perfectly comfortable in there. Immediately better on the shoulders back in, while they're not completely better, but the pain is relieved from the initial event.

Speaker 3:          01:39:34       Now you told me when you looked at my Mri that you think that my shoulder was dislocated at some point in time.

Speaker 2:          01:39:38       I don't remember it exactly your Mri, but if you had a tear of the front of the Labor Room, if you had, and you had that, any evidence of that little dent in the back of the humeral head and then that would be consistent with that.

Speaker 3:          01:39:52       I just do not remember ever having a dislocated shoulder, but I've had, I've been Kamora you've had a bunch of times that you've had it slip maybe a little bit. Well, when just the nature of your shoulder locked, you know, there's been a many American as in my past and Maura's and all these different like hardcore, you know, the thing is we're on the receiving end. Yeah, yeah. Before this injury, I never, Americana you could definitely have at least a subluxation of the shoulder for sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. And you fight it off too because you don't want it to happen. So you're resisting. And um, before this injury, I didn't do any shoulder exercises. I just worked out, but I didn't do any specific exercises just to strengthen my shoulders. And I think that was a big mistake. And I kind of emphasize that with people like doing a external and internal rotation, um, exercises doing like, um, I'm a big fan now of a inverted kettlebell presses and yeah, that's what had been one of my, a giant right. My favorite lately. It's definitely a challenge.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       You don't need much weight and uh, yeah, this little 40 pound iron man Kettlebell, I use this one. It's amazing. That exercise. That's pretty good. Well, it's just a, they say you should be able to do 50% of your Max weight or is that 50% or 90% I forget what they say. I forget me. Don't listen to me. Well, it, it depends on, I think I said 90. Yeah. Obviously in the, in the injured patient or the person that's recovering, we're going to be starting with much lower, much lower, much lower, but focus is on your motion, your, your posture, engaging your core, keeping your ribs down in, in having the full motion. The strong first protocol. I think what they're trying to say is in order to have really powerful shoulders, you should be able to do 90% of your Max Kettlebell press. Like say if you can Max Kettle press 90 pounds.

Speaker 1:          01:41:47       Now that's with the, with the handle down, build down. Right. Okay. Yeah. All right. With Max, that would be your Max. Like what you go with one rep Max. Yes. Or you know what, you would pretty much be, you, maybe you could do two or three if you really had to, but you know, you're talking about a lot of weight. Um, the, you know what you would normally like Max out at like there's, um, there's a protocol that this guy, Pavel Tatsu lean follows. That's really kind of interesting in, you know, Pavel, right? Well, he's the Kettle Bell Guy, right? He's the guy that brought him, they call him the godfather of kettlebells and America. But um, the guy that I trained with talks about that all the time. Yeah. The, the idea behind it is, um, don't do your, like if you could do 10 reps, you do five and you wait a long time and then you do another five and you wait a long time, then you do another five and he never worked a failure.

Speaker 1:          01:42:38       And that working to failure is actually not healthy. It's not smart and you don't really get stronger that way would be my recommendation is that for, and, and, and this is coming from not, this isn't from the orthopedic surgery world. This is what I've read from strength and conditioning people. The thing you want to avoid in doing something to failure is with load in a skill activity. So for example, like a clean or a snatch or something. Things that involve coordination. Yeah. And where you have to time it requires, you know, sound mechanics, right. And you're doing it with load. It's bad to do that to failure because what happens as you fatigue is your mechanics are going to break down, right? That's where you're gonna get hurt. Well, what Pavel talks about is that strength as a skill and that all these different things, think of them as a skill and then don't do things to failure.

Speaker 1:          01:43:31       And if you're looking for, you know, endurance or something along those lines, you want to do light weights and you do want to do multiple repetitions is not what you're doing when you're trying to get stronger. No. Yeah. So it's, there's a, but there's, you know, a lot of different arguments one way or another. I mean, talk to power lifters and they're like, that guy's a pleasure. You got to do it to failure. Yeah. I Dunno. Talk to crossfit people. They want to do 100 reps, you know, no. There, there are activities that you can train to failure and there's no risk. So for example, like, like pull ups, I mean, when you fail, you just, you just can't get up. Right? Right. Like you just going to come off the bar, right. The battle ropes, you just going to fatigue out like there is, you're not going to hurt yourself, right.

Speaker 1:          01:44:15       Do they even believed that when you're doing chin ups, like if you're doing pull ups or Chin ups, um, that when you're doing it, you shouldn't go to failure. You should just stop, like close to it or halfway there and then take a long time off and then do another five reps. Like say if your, your Max is 10 reps, get to five, stop, take a break, do another five stop, take another five, 10 minutes, do another five, keep going and just you're, you're working on form and your muscles are performing these actions in a very clean, smooth delivery and that this is the best way to recover or to build strength and that you just do it more often. Don't do it to failure once a week and then be a wreck for like three or four days afterwards. Because you know that feeling when you, when you lift weights and you lift weights for a week or you lift weights and you lift weights to failure rather, and you're sore for so long, you can't get anything done.

Speaker 1:          01:45:10       This idea is you do more frequent workouts and you don't go to failure but don't go over five Reps. I think one of the biggest mistakes that we see in reasons that people show up in my office, it is because of overload and you know, no time for recovery, right. From the training that you're doing. So you don't see people period ising and incorporating the times when they're just allowing rest. I mean, you can't be working at Max capacity all the time. Right. Exactly. So that's a big thing with fighters. Huge. Yeah. Keeping them for working hard is so hard to do. Yeah. So I always, I try to emphasize with [inaudible] and we have to really talk about this with our acl rehab. Um, because that's a group that, you know, they're so eager to get back, you know, if they're a competitive athlete that, you know, you got to remind them that, look, we have steps to go through.

Speaker 1:          01:46:08       And I always say, you got to work smart. Not Hard. Like, you know, we have a plan and there's a reason why this week may not be a whole lot of work and your body needs rest and recovery in order to put stress on it again so that we can continue to make your progress. Otherwise, at some point you're either going to plateau, you're not going to be making changes, you're gonna get frustrated or you're just going to get hurt. Right. All right, we got to bring this home. So anything else we need to, uh, cover on this? I think so. I think we got, we got to talk about quite a bit. Yeah, we really did. Thank you very much for doing this. I really appreciate it because this is, we've always had these really cool conversations when a visit you in your office. And I'm really glad we got a chance to do this.

Speaker 1:          01:46:45       Now, if people want to get ahold of you and they want to seek treatment, please give them a necessary information. Oh, sure. So our website is www.totalsportsmedicine.com. I like how people still say www, like, yeah. Like I still get there, right? Yeah, you can just total sports medicine.com. Yeah. Um, and then, uh, we have information on there in terms of how to contact us and, uh, you know, we'd be happy to get additional information to patients if they have questions. Awesome. Well, again, thanks for everything you've done for me. It's been a lifesaver and, uh, I've been at umass benefit. Allow me to come down. My pleasure, brother. Thank you doctor Rati Mcgee, ladies, gentlemen, and that's it for this week. We'll see you next week. Bye Bye.

Speaker 7:          01:47:34       Mm.
