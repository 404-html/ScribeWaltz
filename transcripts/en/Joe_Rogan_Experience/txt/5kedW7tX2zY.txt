Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Do do hello world. What's up? What's going on? Rather than my man back from fucking Canada back from Canada. Awesome. What was that experience like for you? Well, that experience was, besides doing mushrooms and running around the woods by yourself. Experienced. Exclude that or you can exclude that from me. That's like taking away of fighters. Ability to talk about fighting. We're up in Canada, bear hunting and are we decided to do mushrooms? Go run off into the woods. I had to check in. Know I understand it's on the right path. Yeah. Yeah. That was fucking. It was powerful, man. Super powerful because bears, as I was telling you, bears have come to me and my visions. Do An eyewash Osca and everything since the drop from the very first time I was doing, I was Osca bears were coming to me and teaching me lessons and I was talking to him.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       So what kind of lessons, man? The first time it came was the first time I did it and I saw this bear and it was wrapped up in all these chains and it was struggling against these gold chains. It's like a Mr. t dot bear had like fucking crown and these heavy gold chains and he was stuck and I couldn't move and the bear like stopped. She was like kind of frantic trying to get out of these chains. He stops and looks at me and he goes, I remember when I was just a bear and I didn't have to worry about all this shit and it was less than about the wealth that we have can become like a prison that holds us back. It prevents us from being our true nature with the bears. True natures. You'd be in a bear chasing after shit, eating shit, climbing trees.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       But the wealth that had accumulated prevented it from doing that. What a bizarre weird. Right? Is that like what? Who's teaching you that? Like what, what is that your imagination? Is that like, what's going on with that? I know I have no idea. And, and that's, you know, it just appeared to me. That's the funny thing. Like it's so strange. It feels real. Like this is a spirit guide teaching it, but it very well could be your imagination. But man, I'm not that creative to think about a bear and gold chains telling me a lesson about wealth. I have a thought on that, that we look at the imagination and we say, oh, he's just imagining things. But everything in the world is from the imagination. Every building, every airplane, every car, every piece of clothing, every computer, everything came out of the imagination. Everything.

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       I think the imagination is something really fucking weird. And it. I think we've somehow or another, we've almost like, no, I don't want to say underestimated, be underrated. We put it into this weird little category. Like it's a silly thing. Oh, you're just imagining. And that allows it to operate and by, by underrating it or by undervaluing it, it allows it to sort of roam free and do all of it's work. But it's responsible for creating everything that we see the humans have ever done in the world. Yeah. It gets interesting for me too, and you think about these mythical creatures like bigfoot and dragons and things like that. When we create them, we actually create the light, the neurons in our brain that form around that memory and that

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       concept. Even if we draw a monster, we've actually created that monster on unlike a micro scale inside our brain and it's just we value this macro scale of the world where it actually breeds and lives, but we're actually assembling light in our brains to create that thing that we're imagining. You know, it's just on a very, very small level and it doesn't have the freedom and flexibility, but we are really truly creating entities all the time. Brian. Yeah. I've really wondered about that with aliens. Would that archetypical alien, the iconic gray with the large black eyes and the like. That thing is real now. It's a real thing whether or not you ever meet one or whether or not one exists in the physical state where you could drag it in front of the national enquirer photographers and get some good shots of it. It's a real thing and what I mean by it's a real thing is if you do mushrooms, you'll fucking see them.

Speaker 2:          00:03:54       You'll you will see them and do. Are you seeing them because you did mushrooms and you're hallucinating, or are you seeing them because we've created this archetype that plugs into the imagination easily and connects you to this thing, this, this imaginary world or this world that. See, I don't even like the word imaginary because like every time I've done a psychedelic, I don't. I don't like that word imaginary because to me it seems like it's some sort of a frequency that you're tuning into. We're a real world exists that you can't bring back anything physical from. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah, and I feel like it's entirely possible that what we think of as these, these like gray aliens, they're like a, almost like a frequency of the universe that you can tune into whether you're on psychedelics or whether you're dreaming, which is of course your brain producing its own psychedelics.

Speaker 2:          00:04:51       Your brain produces dimethyltryptamine while you're sleeping. So these, these things that we think of as being like all these imaginary things like aliens or bears that talk to you or Hagens. Yeah. I wonder what the fuck that really is all about. I think you're really onto something there, but it seems like there's this archetype of frequency, like a dragon is a being of unlimited power and we've imagined what that would look like visually if that were an animal, what does it look like? And a dragon just fits that so fucking perfect with the wings and the Scales and smaug from token. Yeah. And you're looking at that and like, Oh yeah, that fits that thing. You know, and you think about a cold, dispassionate, calculating machine that is dissecting you like than, Oh yeah. Alien with the big eyes and the no nuts that fits that so that no vagina either.

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       They don't need that shit. They just dispatched of it so that just like we, we create this visual representation of this, of this archetype. Even Zeus, Zeus should look, look, look like Zeus looks like we're good at like the physical look of something to this concept that is kind of very real. Yeah. We wouldn't trust Zeus if he had like a dark goatee. He's got to have a fucking white beard and white hair. He always says white hair. Right. Have you ever seen Zeus without white hair? Well, I mean, he turned into all kinds of shit. He would turn into like a swan and rape somebody and like golden missed and rape. Somebody was like a mass rapist was constantly right, but everybody. It was the bill cosby of, of ancient gods go in as a goal is golden rain. He raped somebody. Got Pregnant as golden ring. Wow. That's rude. Yeah. Seriously. What's the defendant? Somebody as rain, at least give them a heads up who expects to go outside and just get raped by the rain. Good. No. It was also a convenient excuse. If you got pregnant.

Speaker 2:          00:06:48       There was a sprinkle. It was golden. I think Zeus. He's raping a dude there. What's he doing that cutting off his dad's Dick. Oh, good lawyers was the. Was the titan. They were always cutting off each other's Dick and then they would throw one, think he threw one into the ocean and it created some other tighten and cut his own dad's Dick off. Life was hard back then, man. That was a hard world. Those people live. Yeah, for sure. A bunch of Dick cut and assholes. No doubt. I really do wonder like what I mean, there's, it's, it's, it is, uh, an ent in empty wonder. Like there's no end to it. There's no way you'll ever going to solve like no one's going to say, oh, we figured out exactly what's happening when you tripping on mushrooms and here is what it is and this is why, you know, you see these things and this is what those things actually are.

Speaker 2:          00:07:41       And this is the part of your brain that creates them and they're absolutely not real. Oh yeah. Well, there's the materialist reductionist point of view, like something that Sam Harris could explain very well. All right. When you take psilocybin, the default mode network and your brain gets starved of blood which starves at of oxygen, which downregulates it, allowing the other parts of your brain to come forward, like, got it, but then take some and then see how that feels, what that, what comes through. Yeah. Well there's a chemical process, right? But then there's the experience and the experiencing itself. This is if you've heard me say this before, but this is kind of important. The experience is exactly the same whether or not it's in a physical form or whether or not it's something that happens to you while you're tripping the experiences the same like if you have a trip and during that trip you meet a golden serpent that explains the universe to you and it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:31       It explains that every single person is in fact a representation of what we think of as love, love or or a God or creativity or some divine force that is pushing forward improvement and innovation and that that is the reason why life today is so much different than it was 30 years ago or 30 before that or 300 years before that. It will constantly keep improving and it is the way of the universe and that if you. If you have that in a psychedelic trip, it's exactly the same as if it happens to you. Like if you go to a field and a dragon rises out of a marsh and confronts you with all of the problems of your personality and all the mysteries of the past and gives you an understanding and a blueprint for how to move forward with your life and then goes back in a swamp.

Speaker 2:          00:09:25       It's exactly the same as if you're tripping. Like the experience is the same. Like whether like, well we found the Dragon, we've located him on gps and I look on Google Earth. You can see the dragon moving through the marsh. It's a real dragon. It doesn't matter like physically if it's a real dragon, the experience is the same and the impact that it has and that's the thing that we're seeing now in these scientific inquiries is that it's not just you have this experience like go into a movie and you come back out and you're relatively the same afterwards. These are having the lasting impacts and the significant changes throughout a lifetime that you would expect from a huge event like you just described happening in the real world because it does feel real to you and the information you're getting and the experiences you have.

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       It changes you. It's not like you put it in this dream world like, oh, that was weird. I saw this person naked in my dream, but it's different. You know, that feels like kind of like random, like you just shaken up some dice and throwing it. This stuff comes to you in a way that just leaves a significant impact. Yeah, and the scientific reductionist point of view is really important because we really do need to understand what's the chemical process that's going on in the brain when you consume whatever pod, whatever it is, we need to understand. I mean it's fascinating and it's important for research and it's important that science keeps moving forward. The greater and greater understanding of the mind, but it can't discount what is happening as a human, as a person, as a, as a, as a, an entity with consciousness.

Speaker 2:          00:10:55       What's happening during that experience like you really you can really talk to God really can meet him for sure. I mean you and I've met them together yet or met whatever the fuck we met, whatever that is. When you're in the DMT realm, I don't know what that is, but if there's a god that's cooler than that holy shit, and that's the thing. It comes like the stories are not. They're not inconsistent. You'll go to these IOWASCA retreats. You have 20 people and seven of them will talk to God. That's the same dude they're describing. It doesn't matter what religion background they come from. You hadn't like pre discussed what this notion is. It's like the wisdom that comes through from that element source or whatever you want to call it God. Or have you talked to mother earth that the wisdom is all consistent and it's weird that way.

Speaker 2:          00:11:43       You know? It's like you never hear something like, man, that's strange. It's really contradictory to what I what he told me, like to see some people given dmt, like preferably the way strassman does it cause strassman minus the anal plug that made them think that aliens were sodomized him. There was an anal plug. There was like an anal thermometer. Oh, check your core temperature. Yeah. That's not good. Yeah. It had everybody thinking that aliens were raping them. Zeus, Zeus stuff. Not the best idea. Yeah. Well is he. Well, there you go. Like why? Why is that? Why are we thinking that aliens are raping us? Because there's something in your breath. It's obviously thermometer. You're are you given knowledge of with the mometer in your. But before you go in there, you are right. Do they whisper in your ear? I mean, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:12:27       It's it. The world itself is so fucking slippery. You know, they're just the world itself. The idea that I'm looking at you through my eyes were making noises with our faces and somehow or another we're translating this back and forth to each other through this thing, which is a microphone which works in a way that neither new nor I can describe to anybody. Jamie. Again, it goes through these wires and it's going wirelessly out into people's phones. I mean, these people that are streaming it right now live with their phone in their car, driving around four g lte. The fucking world is slippery as shit it is, you know, it's amazing how fast we adapt though humans are really good at adapting to this new shit that comes in. We almost adapt so fast that we take it for granted way earlier than we should.

Speaker 2:          00:13:12       It's like, oh yeah, that thing. Cool. Got It. Yeah. There was an article about that recently about how primate brains are sort of predisposed to being able to adapt incredibly quickly and that sort of makes sense. If you look at the wide variety of cultures throughout the world and what they think is normal, what they accept, like um, those women in Africa that have those giant plates in their lips. Like how was like, how did that get going? Well the next that they will judge that they stretched their necks out so far and they have those things that they couldn't support themselves. Yeah, there it is. The primary brain is pre adapted to face potentially any situation. It's a really interesting article and I'm not going to do a good job of it without someone reading it, but that's, that's the title of it. It's unfair. [inaudible] dot org, a p, h, a y s.org and it's the prime.

Speaker 2:          00:14:04       The title is the primate brain is pre adapted to face potentially any situation and it just talks about how your brain sort of calculates potential outcomes and all these different variables that could possibly take place. So when it moves into that direction of sorts of set the landscape. When you look at how we developed and you look at something like the genetic bottleneck theory, where these big cataclysms would happen dramatically, reduce the human population, you're dealing with these macro changes on a global level, well, the most flexible and adaptive are going to survive the stubborn acids that are like, nope, I'm not leaving my forte. My Forte is my home. This is a model and land like, fuck that forest was burning in. You got to go to the ocean. You got to figure out how to fish quick. There's food in the water, figure out how to get that food on land into your belly or you're not going to make it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:49       You're not going to make it. And those are the humans that have survived. So that trait will continue to be one of the most important traits and obviously it comes to the surface in these large scale events. Yeah, that's why I've always laughed. Like I told you a, and I know you. You rented a place there recently too. I've rented a place in Malibu for awhile on the beach and I'm like, what the fuck kind of place is this like you just banking. That's something that's constantly changing and moving and growing is going to stick around long enough for your investment to pan out, you know, because you made an investment. Like these houses are worth fucking millions of dollars and there's no yard in the back because it's just the ocean and without a doubt that ocean is going to keep moving forward. It's without a doubt.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       It's just like, how much time do you have? It's like a long real estate game of musical chairs. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I was at the house and the waves would hit underneath the house so hard that the house would shake it around, so it was like it was like a plan for am high tide earthquake of the waves and just like you're counting on the fact that there isn't that rogue 15 footer that comes in and just wipes out your whole window. I fucked up because the first day, literally the first day we stayed there, I got barbecued, like barbecued on edibles and uh, we were downstairs. There's three floors to this house we were renting in. The first floor was literally the water you would, you could open the window and jump into the water and it's a four foot drop and I'm not exaggerating.

Speaker 2:          00:16:21       It's fucking ridiculous. And in the daytime it looks so amazing. It's so beautiful and Baloo and lovely and the sea, the birds and the waves are so gentle and inviting. But at nighttime in the dark, it becomes a monster, like giant, dark, black, uncaring beast that will swallow you whole and not give a fuck. It's absorbed a billion people before you. It'll absorb you just as easy and you realize the true nature of it. When it's dark, when it's dark, you go, oh, this is like another world like you're, it's like as if, if you could get a high rise and that high rise could like hit the edge of an alternative galaxy. It's like if you, if you could like climb on top of your roof and throw rocks into the event horizon of a black hole and they would disappear into another galaxy and that's almost what it's like.

Speaker 2:          00:17:19       It's like it's another world. Yeah, and the farther you get out into the deep, crazier it gets, right? Because there's no limit on the depth. You're going over one of those chasms that are miles deep and had no fucking idea what animals are in there. And that's where these ideas of these crackings, these beasts, the deep would come because he plays with our subconscious. It's outer space, but in our planet and underneath us in the water, you know, so you're just looking at this like, man, something could definitely come up there and eat me. Especially, you know, you don't have enough vitamin C, you're getting too much sun, you're a little delirious. Then all of a sudden you'd fucking seen mermaids and sea monsters and shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They, they found cracking suction cups. What do they call those things? What do they call the suction cups?

Speaker 2:          00:18:04       Tentacles. It's just suckers. They found them in a fossilized form, but that would indicate something that's well over 100 foot octopus, so that was a real animal at one point in time. So this idea of the crack. The problem with those things is when they die, they just die. Like there are soft tissue animal. All they have is a beak and that gets absorbed by the ocean too. So there's virtually no evidence other than these fossilized suction cups they found. But when they found him, they went, Whoa, Holy Shit. Because you're talking about, you know, like fucking garbage can lids that are suction cups and you just think like, well how big is the fucking technical man? Jesus Christ. It's like an aggressive garbage disposal is. That is all the tentacles. Grab everything that is soft enough to get chomped by that beat, grab it, push it in and smart as fuck and fast.

Speaker 2:          00:18:57       Well, there was another article recently where the scientists were saying that essentially octopuses are aliens. There is nothing like them. They have more chromosomes and any other observed animal. They're different than any observed animal be besides cuddle fish. Their ability to rapidly adapt and camouflage themselves to their environment is unprecedented. They change their texture, they changed what they look like. I had a Ramey warrant on who's a great guy and he has a television show called Apex Predator and one of his, one of his a apex Predator episodes and in his show he's a hunter and he used to be on the show called Solo hunter where he would go by himself with like a bunch of cameras and just go deep deep into the woods and hunt and sort of ics and capture this experience in this really remote forest is in a really cool way because it was literally just him like survivor man style with a few cameras setup and hunting and then cooking the food and eating it and heading back and running into some weird difficulties and dangers and strange animals while he's out there too, but he did an episode on octopus and he came in and was talking to us about it and it fucking blew my mind.

Speaker 2:          00:20:06       Add no idea. I don't mean I was 47, 48 years old. I had no idea that a fucking octopus could do that. They can change like that instantaneous. I think I've told this story on here before, but I got to see one in Fiji and watch this. Virgin man hunt it and it was one of the craziest experiences ever. They were. It was flowing over the coral and just like you said, half of his body would be one color, half the other color. It was fast. It wasn't like it weighted because we have a noise and chameleons in Texas. They plant somewhere and there's some weird color that they're not supposed to be and then eventually they turn into Brown for tree bark or green for the leaves or whatever they're at, but not an octopus man. That shit is instant, instantaneous.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       And when he was fighting it, so he eventually goes down, their jams, his hand in there and the octopus bites and there's blood in the water was this crazy struggle. But eventually he jams his hand back in there, pulls the octopus out, and when he was fighting with the octopus on the surface, the octopus knew to go for his airway. Like it was wrapping, kept wrapping its tentacles around his mouth and his nose as he was trying to get this thing off his head. He knew exactly what he was doing. It was pulling off so eventually wrestles is snorkel free and starts beating it to get it to calm down. And he brought it to the shore and barbecued it. Now everybody else was just fucking horrified at this show because it was completely savage. I mean it was the octopus trying to choke the airway of this primate in this primate being stronger and more determined and using a snorkel is a bludgeoned to, to kill it so he could eat it. I think I want to. I like octopus is delicious, but I think on my backend off that there might be a little too fucking smart for me to be eating them.

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       Yeah. But that's, you know, that's again that bias that have of all of the things. Like if people say, oh no, this animals too intelligent to eat, but there are a pescatarian when they're probably eating the fuck out of some octopus, which are way smarter than deer. That's a good point, you know, like, so it's just a weird. It's a whole weird dynamic that we have of what we decide we should or couldn't do. And here's a good point for people that are vegans. If you are a Vegan and you think you need some form of protein other than I'm like a look at this thing, killing a shark. Um, if you need some sort of protein other than I'm a ethically raised chickens, eggs, which is harmless and doesn't hurt anybody, but um, mollusks apparently there's a real good argument that they are incapable of feeling any pain at all.

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       They don't have any fear. They have zero emotions, zero reaction. They have one instinctive reaction to close their shell. And that's it. Like they're barely an animal. Get you some cashew milk. Clam Chowder, clam chowder is got milk in it. That's what I said. Oh, that's right. Okay. Cashew milk. Have you had this? No, I just made it up with somebody to do it in Austin right now. Someone's opening up cash register, clam chowder, fucking food truck. But like um, like scallops, scallops are probably the most delicious food on the planet. Like pound for pound. Yeah, they're right up there. And if they're, if they don't, if they're just like a meat thing, it's like essentially what I'm saying is there are, there are like, you know, how they have the scientists that are developing meet in laboratory and dishes there that with a hard shell, like you can eat them convenient packaging because I know a lot of vegans that are absolutely nutritionally deficient.

Speaker 2:          00:23:30       They're not getting enough vitamin D, they're not getting enough d three, they're not getting enough [inaudible]. They're definitely not getting enough essential fatty acids unless they're scooping coconut oil and almond butter into their mouth everyday. Cla different things and you know, they, they're committed to the cause and so they're just physically not doing the best because of it. Yeah, I mean, do you start, you start, as you've done, you've talked about the intelligence and plants. You start looking at that and then versus a mollusk they're way smarter than a mollusk yeah. Are Mollusks and plants. They're possibly fairly equivalent, you know, so like the whole cause of, of why you're not eating them gets a little blurry when you start reading. All right, well plants are smart as shit and mollusks are mollusks and they're probably equivalent. Just one has the ability to move slightly more than the other one.

Speaker 2:          00:24:19       Yeah. The movement thing is something that we cling to. What we essentially cleaned too is things that are closest to us. Like we really don't give a fuck about fish. Like we're worried about people killing all the fish in the ocean. We're worried about the police in the ocean. But when a little kid catching the fish, you go, you go and look at the instagram page, there's no hate. You know, a little kid shoots a bear back the fuck up. You don't even want to read those comments. You know, if something, if someone eats a bear like, well that's too close to a dog dogs. My friend dogs are just like people. Sally's my baby. She's a dog. And the bears just like sally and I can't eat a bear. Yeah. It's just anthropomorphization. Yeah. Like just putting human traits on different animals, which I can totally see.

Speaker 2:          00:25:03       You know, there's some animals that seem more human, like we recognize more attributes than others. Well, I have a thing with wolves. I, I absolutely have some sort of a weird anthropomorphization thing with wolves were um, you know, I think there were like probably my favorite animals ever. There's the fucking coolest things of all time. They, they, they have these packs. They mate for life, they get together and fucking, they have this social group, they have this really complex method of hunting where they communicate with each other. They howl out to each other and they have like a roll call. I mean, there are complex, really intense society. Yeah. I won't hold it against him that they mate for life. I'll excuse them. That was pretty amazing because their life is hard as fuck. And it doesn't last long because you can't be a pimp.

Speaker 2:          00:25:52       But apparently there's a documentary about a wolf and ironically enough to call it the black wolf. And there was a black wolf that apparently wasn't following any of the rules and this wolf would go across the highway, away from the rest of the pack and lure the women over to him. And he was banging these women and female wolves, obviously not women, human. I'm really anthropomorphizing now. Um, and, and then protecting actual bitches. Yeah. And wouldn't the right way of saying it and wouldn't mate in, wouldn't like find a mate for life until he was old. And then when he's old as are, I'll come back and start running shit. And then when he's old he came back, got a mate, started running things and just sort of settled down. But it was interesting. It's like this wolf had chosen a different way of life. And it's a documentary

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       on it. It's interesting because, you know, in, in all of these Iowasca trips and all of these things, I've talked to animals of all kinds of variety. And again, this could be just pure imagination, but in that, you know, they always have lessons or things that we discussed. And one of the common themes is the amount of freewill that the animal hat. So when I talked to the insects and you really talk, you don't talk to one insect, you talked to the insect over mine. Again, this could all just be my imagination, but it helps me understand things a bit. You talked to the insect over mine and the insects say basically we are like the trash keepers of the, of the world. Like we have no flexibility for freewill. If we all decided to go on strike, the world's fucked, you know, nothing gets decomposed.

Speaker 1:          00:27:23       There's no spare parts. We run out of spare parts for the world. Everything. Nothing else gets built. The whole thing goes to shit. The food source at the very bottom, so we have no freewill, were perfect, perfect creatures acting in perfect accordance with the laws of nature to allow it to happen. Where you get these things like the atomic automatons, like the digger wasps. But no matter how much you fuck with thing, they'll try to do the same thing over and over again. Well really that's, that's perfect because it's doing absolutely what it must and then you go on up the up the chain towards the mammals and there's gets to be greater and greater access to free will. So you talked to like I've talked to dolphins and dolphins. Spirit was like super happy, playful and they said, you know, dolphins, one of the best existence of all because we have greater access to free will, we can choose to play, we can choose the fuck, we can choose these different elements.

Speaker 1:          00:28:10       Getting food is easy and it's also how easy it is to get food. Like getting food is easy for us, you know, there's not a lot of natural predators, so we have kind of the ultimate existence and we don't have the human brain, which is the ultimate Sabbath tour. You know, it's our own minds that lock us in. These depressions and anxieties and hell's and dolphins don't have that level of self awareness that they've created all the problems. So it's almost like they're in this perfect sweet spot, which is one of the things that you feel when you encounter in both in real life and envision is that they're just happy as fuck because they have the most flexibility with the least amount of troubles that come from it.

Speaker 3:          00:28:45       Yeah. We were talking about this on the, on the ride when we were in Edmonton, Alberta Rather. And it was really interesting because we were talking about, was it Ben O'brian that was telling us about a queen that got stuck in someone's car queen bee. They got in a car, a queen bee got stuck in someone's car and the colony followed them for like 20 miles, some insane amount of distance and you know, this guy was just getting fucking followed by bees and couldn't figure out what the hell was going on. Well, they had a mandate. There was, there was no freewill. There was no discussion whether or not I'm tired of fine. Like they were just going to fly to the end and they flew and found this guy's car with the fucking queen in it. And I don't know how it got resolved but how they knew

Speaker 1:          00:29:34       exactly. But yeah, that's, it follows that that would be the, that would be the behavior because these, they don't have the flexibility to do that because everything would fall apart. You know, they're like the perfect robots of, of life. And I think, you know, you start talking about these distinctions between life and, you know, artificial intelligence life. I think really consciousness and freewill are inexorably linked. Like that is kind of the key component. You know, like yes these insects are alive, but are they fully conscious? You know, while I think it really depends on their access to free will, their ability to make a choice. I think that is the defining characteristic of consciousness is choice.

Speaker 3:          00:30:13       Well that's another weird thing about people that are really into animals. Like we'll, we'll make a distinction between animals and insects. Like I have friends that just fucking love animals. They adopt dogs and cats and. But they'll fucking kill any bug. It's on their counter. Know this. They'll see a bug or other counter. They just, Oh you bitch, you're dead. Could be random. Harmless beetle over, it's like a mosquito lands on them. Slap, you know, there's no negotiating with. With insects. We find an insect but they won't eat them, which is weird. You know, it's one of those weird things. Cricket protein bars. Yeah. Well, you know, they just. Vegans don't eat bugs. They don't need animal protein. They're responsible for the death. Listen, I'm not trying to put this on you guys. If you're a Vegan, you know, if you buy grain from a store, you are directly responsible for the death of countless bugs.

Speaker 3:          00:31:11       Countless rodents. Who knows how many rabbits. Who knows how many deer fonds. If you buy anything that is indiscriminately collected with a combine and that's how they get grain. They have these huge machines. If you've never seen it before, Jamie, pull up a grain combine inaction because it's like, whoa. That is some alien machine sent down to sheer the earth. This is, it's kind of fucking. It's a weird way we do it. I mean, we used to do it with like the grim reaper sickle, you know, that's how they used to do at that cool thing with the two handles on it. Is that what it is aside? What's the definition of sickle and aside sickles? The Russian thing, right? Yeah. I think what does that one smaller one. It's a handheld jammy the. When they use those things, it's really, it's that that's only one aspect of one of the things that's problematic about large scale collecting of food, but look at this fucking thing.

Speaker 3:          00:32:07       This enormous machine, and this is not even a big one. That's a fairly small one. They have ones that are like a football field. Why? At the mega farms? Yeah. This is like something like if you had a small farm you would do, but anything that's in there is getting chewed up. And one of the things about fonts, it's really unfortunate, but fonds when they're young, they will lie down in these fields and they don't move because they can't run. They can't run any predators. So their strategy is to just not move and hope something doesn't find them. Yeah. And that's why

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       they have those, uh, the coloration on their bodies very different. They have the white spots, which is kind of a nature's version of some sort of form of camouflage to blend in. But those poor fonds get chewed up in those things all the time. I have a friend who was a, he is a large scale corn farm in Illinois and they, you know, they make a corn for mostly for livestock. They grow corn for livestock and they have those giant, huge ones and they just chew fonds up all the time. I think the problem that a lot of people make is they attribute morality to the actions you're taking rather than the intention behind it. You know what I mean? And I think people make that mistake a lot really. So it's hunting good or bad. Well that's a, that's a ridiculous question to ask.

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       It depends on the intention of the hunter while he's doing it. You know, and I think that's why a lot of people reserve this kind of native American idea because we feel and we understand that the intentions of that person, that hunter was in a way that was different than the guy just looking to put a trophy on as well, right? One of those automatic guns that are on a camera that shooting animals that way, it's not the act that's either good nor bad, nor is it Vegan good nor bad. It's about the intentions behind it. And I think people tend to lose that perspective. You know? So that's when, when I was in bear camp, that's what I needed to get straight is what my intentions were. If I was going after the hunt a bear. So I would be cool and cam would think I was cool and everybody in the hunting party would be like, yeah, well that was the wrong intention for me.

Speaker 1:          00:34:15       So that's what a lot of the work was. That's what the part of what the taking the mushrooms was for was to make sure that my intention in doing it was the right intention and that you know, and what was that intention? Well, to me it was some part meet acquisition. I wanted to have that experience of taking my own meat from the field, which was incredibly powerful for me the first time I wanted and then I wanted to have to be able to use the code and use the, the clause for jewelry and really connect with that. But you know, so that if that intention was leading, then it was a correct action for me. If that intention was not leading and I was doing it to be cool, they're doing it because I was nervous or any other way, then it wasn't immoral act for me and that's to me how I just kind of sorted it out.

Speaker 1:          00:34:55       So I was able to get to that comfortable place where I knew that I. If the bear came the right, the right bore came, I was going to do it for the right intention because I'd worked through all of the other forces and pressures that desire to be cool or the desire for this. There are all these other reasons that would have made that act. Not Cool. You know, I've worked through those as best I could. And so I knew if the bear came, I was comfortable killing and I had no idea in my head that this was the wrong thing because my intentions were right. Well also your intentions. I mean, you had many opportunities to kill a bear as it I totally. But what we go for is very big mature bears for a couple reasons. One, because very big mature bears kill cubs.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       Um, it's one of the favorite things to eat when they come out of hibernation, which is really fucked up. They actively hunt cubs that go for them. They even go into dance and pulled them out of Dan's and kill them. There's a lot of debate as to why they do that. The initial thought was that it brings the female back into estrous and that the bear can breed with the female and that way that bears passing on his genetics, but there's some scientists and biologists and wildlife biologists that believed that just doing it for meat and it's just there's a lot of competition out there and it's hard to get meat and this is meat and they've gotten accustomed to it and whether they're doing it because they're hungry or whether they're doing it because they want the female to survive a and or a come back into heat and breed again.

Speaker 2:          00:36:25       Either way they're they're killing cubs and they're limiting the DNA. They're limiting the genetics and it's not good for the overall population of the bears. So the idea is when you kill the large male bores that what you're doing is you're actually enhancing the genetics of the area and you're saving the cubs. So, you know, it seems counterintuitive. When you kill bores, you're actually increasing the population of bears. Yeah. It's really weird when you, when you, you know, when you look at it outside of the world of hunting, when you don't have all the information at your fingerprints, you, you have this idea that like hunters are like those bad guys in that wolverine movie that we're poisoning the bear. Did you ever see that? They're always in the movies. They're always the assholes that are killing bears, you know, meanwhile wolverine, we'll sit down and eat a steak and he's a good guy.

Speaker 2:          00:37:14       Very were, were so fucking torture. Didn't and twisted when it comes to our morality. But the, uh, also the big one is the population of the traditional game. Animals like the Moose and the deer and the elk. They get decimated by bears and it's the Fonz. They kill all the fonts and the, all the calves. And that's a huge problem in those regions like Alberta where we were, which is just overrun with bears. I mean, have you ever imagined you're going to see that many bears in the first night we were out there, there was eight, nine different barriers just cruising around crazy all within five to 15, 20 yards. Crazy. It was insane. You know, one of the stories that Cam told I think gave me one of the biggest lessons and takeaways of the trip for me was the one who told about there was a mother with her cubs and the cubs were kind of cruising around and then a, a big male bear came in and then killed one of the cubs and I think the mother like scared her off, scared off the bore and it was just a dead cub that she had there.

Speaker 2:          00:38:17       And so for a moment the mother kind of wanders around and looked like she was like, mourning the death of this cup, but just for a moment. And then within minutes, you know, seconds it was eating. The cub was eating her own cup and that was like a really, you know, we humans have this idea of this trauma we carry, like

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       if our, if our kid got got killed, you know, we would carry that trauma for the rest of our life. But for the bear, yeah, there was a moment of recognition, but bears are constantly living in the present moment. They're like the embodiment of the present moment and in the present moment that death happened in the past, that death was over. What's there now is there's meat on the ground that'll feed her and provide an opportunity for her to live longer and provide for the rest of her cubs. So it's a simple decision at that point, if we don't carry the traumas of our past with us, there's meat on the ground. You eat the meat, you know that simple, that simple thing. And that's in that way it's wide. Like nature is really perfect because nature is always in the present moment. You know, like I was blasted on the mushrooms and I went to that bear carcass near where a cam and killed his bear. They had this just decomposing bear carcass, which you know, taking mushrooms and seeing a decomposing bear carcass with.

Speaker 3:          00:39:26       Well, it wasn't really that decomposing like was it one night, but that was one from a week before.

Speaker 1:          00:39:32       Yeah, it was like there was another one that they've already taken all the skin and all the meat off of, so it's just the bones in the organs that were there and cam had his. His bear is still nice, wasn't even smelling or anything. It looked great fresh, but this other bear which was right in the same area. It was really interesting because I was very aware of the forest around it and I just looked at the forest around it and the forest was not mourning the death of the bear, the foresters in the present moment. It was just going about the business of returning that bear to spare parts. It had no traumatic memory of that incident and it's really how, how nature works perfectly because it's always in the present moment like this. The body doesn't weep for the death of a cell.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       Cells die all the time, but the bodies in the presence so it just carries on. It doesn't carry that trauma with it, you know, and ultimately the forest doesn't. We've for the death of the bear and ultimately the cosmos won't weep for the death of the earth. When the sun explodes. No, you know, like everything will just be in the present and that's, that's where you know this, the ease of all the suffering is so much of our own suffering is we're carrying all these dead bodies of the past with us all the time and these expectations of the future and that's where we get so fucked up, but if we really look to nature, nature has this allure and this beauty because it's just constant presence and body. It's just looking on the bleeding edge of now and making decisions based upon that rather than these mental constructs.

Speaker 3:          00:40:59       Yeah. It's this beautifully intense system that's just constantly moving. It's just constantly moving forward. It's one of the things that I find so attractive about wolves and I think many people do this. They're so romantic in that their, their existence is so vibrant and powerful and so brief. You know, if a wolf is super lucky, they get to 10. You know? I think getting managed imagined. I mean, my, my middle daughter's eight years old, like wrap your head around that. A wolf is like almost dead. Like I have a dog that's 10. He's almost done. You know, he's, he's got gray all over his face and he limps when he walks now and he likes to lay down mostly, you know, that's, that's a wolf man. Ten years, that's all they get. But during that 10 year, fuck they live. Yeah. They just run in howland together and grabbing the back.

Speaker 3:          00:41:49       I mean, that's one of the crazy things about wolves to that I admire in some sort of a real fucked up way that they kill for fun. Like they sport kill, you know it. It's people that love animals. When you bring that up, they defended to the death. Oh my God. They go off about it and know whether the animals were probably sick and they're taking them off. Nope. They're having a fucking blast. They're running around and tearing these elka part. Like we were talking about it a couple of weeks ago. They found 19 dead elk that these wolves didn't even eat. They call them surplus kills. They just go on rampages, you know, I have a, um, a friend of mine who lives up in BC and he said they'll get into like sheep, like they'll find like a pen of sheep and they'll kill 19, 20 of them.

Speaker 3:          00:42:36       They just rip them apart. They don't give a fuck. They don't give a fuck. They're just having fun. It's part of what they are that like we have this like intense romantic connection to wolves is like they have a little bit of us and um, they have a little bit of party in them. You know, they're the towel in and shit and having a good old time and they have battles with each other to see who becomes the king, you know. So did you see that video recently of these folks were in Canada and they were driving down the highway and as they were driving they saw these mountain goats running or sheep running away from a wolf and the wolves chasing them and the wolf tackles the fucking sheep and kills it instantly. Right in front of them. It's always fucking Canada. Like that Martin that killed the bear. See if you could find it though, because it's pretty cool and it's pretty cool to see wolf takes out a sheep mountain, rocky mountain sheep. But the, when the wolf took out the sheep, he carries this thing up the side of the hill like you would carry like a five year old. Yeah. And it's like things like basically his size and he just grabs it with his face. Here it is. See these, uh, see he breaks away well back up a little bit. So you could see and give us some volume.

Speaker 3:          00:43:58       Look at this. It breaks off and watch this Bam bitch. That's a wrap. Rips it apart. Instantly. Look at that instant death. I mean, there's no quicker kill in a wolf and a sheep. I mean it's, it's, it's, it's still breathing, but its neck had snapped and it's done. Fucking beautiful animal. That wolf is now watch when he grabs it, he's like, get over here, bitch. Look at this. Don't open that window too wide. Yeah. He might come and get you a bitch. Boy, he probably wouldn't know. He's got that right there.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       People probably tastes like shit. Tastes like cheetos and cigarettes. The fucking animals. Just. It's such a fucking majestic animal. I think that's why we have such an allure to it and people love animals so much is because they're not carrying around all the bullshit that we are. They're just living full and presently, and they're not straddled with these concepts of morality in these differently. They're just living to the most of their directive. It's in the present. You have the idea of eternity with you. It's like there's. You're not worried about this other stuff, so they you just go and you just fucking live to the very fullest and we can count those moments that we have is our best moments in life, you know, and we can recall maybe dozens of times if we're lucky, they'll be hundreds of times in those, in a normal person's life where they're just totally present, embodied, free doing exactly what they fucking want to do.

Speaker 2:          00:45:27       Yeah. And in a lot of ways, the world that we've constructed, the modern world with social media and with constantly being inundated with new new stories that have almost nothing to do with you there on the other side of the world, you know, someone got shot on the other side of the planet. Someone fell off of a mountain. You know, this guy who died in a fiery car accident a thousand miles from you. I mean all this stuff is like constantly going on. It's constantly coming at you and it makes it really difficult to focus on the actual life that you're living. I mean, we almost get, are getting too much data. I think that's, that's one element, but I think the more toxic element is the look at me element, which is the, here's what I'm doing at this time, here's me snapchatting this because it puts above.

Speaker 2:          00:46:11       Take a picture of you and put it on instagram saying that it puts, it puts the awareness of other people watching you into the forefront of your mind, you know, so like right now that was a fucked up smile. I just gave her that because I was thinking about you taking a picture of me. So I changed my behavior. It wasn't handed, it wasn't normal and that's what we're doing constantly. We have, we have this idea that everybody's looking at us and we're, we're like, we're really are the stage actors. And that was that famous line from William Shakespeare. We all but actors in the world is a stage. Well with social media it becomes that we're always just acting and playing this role. That's not our authentic self. Like bear down asked on the grass like what the fuck is this thing? Let me get back in touch with the monkey and figuring out what feels good for him, what I want to do, and it becomes your world like it might not be your world, but it becomes your world when, when you're one of those, uh, Yoga booty girls that just sticks her ass up in the air for all our instagram pictures.

Speaker 2:          00:47:09       Now God bless him. God bless him. Thank God. Thank God they're out there. But when, when there's a gal like that that has 5 million instagram followers and her notifications are constantly coming in and she's checking her likes and damn girl, you hot damn girl, you find, oh shit, can I get with you? And they're looking at all their comments and getting all that love, all that attention. Then that becomes them and then mean. I mean, I would hope that they're well rounded and they also read books and they also do a lot of other things and they meditate and take yoga and really get it, but it's highly likely they don't. It's highly likely that they just stare at the pictures of their own ass and go back to the gym for the second time in a day and do dead lifts and just fucking fat that ass up and thinking about getting fat injected into it and like, oh right.

Speaker 2:          00:47:55       Yeah. What people fail to realize is that that in itself is a pressure and that pressure needs a response of equal magnitude in order to balance here. It's like all of these people with, with fame, you know, especially fame that you really didn't work that hard for, you know, and so I think where we're athletes and just kinda just celebrities, pop culture, celebrities are instagram celebrities have a little bit of a different feel because that athlete knows all the fucking quiet moments like steph curry knows all of those hundreds of thousands of shots he took when nobody was watching and dribbling around and practicing and practicing. So when he gets out there, his what he's doing and what he's known for, it makes sense and it's solid. It's grounded in something, but all of a sudden you have a great ass and the ability to take a decent photo and you're, you've got the reach of 5 million people.

Speaker 2:          00:48:44       I think that amount of pressure really fucks with you and you have to take extreme measures to counteract that and to get yourself back grounded again. More time in nature, meditation, float tank eating, we'd whatever you want to do, you know, find that other thing to counteract that. Recognize it for what it is and, and don't just look at the positive aspect of it. Look at the negative that it's having because I think if you don't, we see the effects of that all the time. We see the Robin Williams, we see, you know, the people who are dying of these overdoses that ostensibly should be happy as fuck, but they're not. They haven't dealt with the pressure of fame in a way that's as aggressive as the pressure that it's caused on. Yeah. Robin Williams might not be the best example because we had a bobcat in the other day and bobcat was a really good friend of Robin's and Robin was diagnosed with several illnesses.

Speaker 2:          00:49:31       One of them was Parkinson's, but there was another one. There was a, a brain illness that he was diagnosed with. Do you remember the name of a Jamie Lewy body disease? I believe, but it, it, um, it directly affects the way he perceived the world. Like he had a real issue. Yeah. Batman in Batman or whatever the joker was. Heath Ledger. Pillow guy. Yeah. Yeah. So the pressure, but they're responding to the pressure in a way that's deleterious for their life rather than responding to the pressure being like, man, this is fucked up. I got all of these people looking at me. I got to do some other work in society is not pushing them in that way either. They're just saying more and more and more, get another roll, get more followers. Right. Um, you know, it's like the demon voice that you have from your act, like exactly that they have that fucking thing in their head. And the other guy like, hey man, go fucking on a vision

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       quest, like find some mountains by yourself where nobody's watching it and you don't have to act at all. You can just be you. Well, this is what I wrote a note earlier because we were talking about depression and I've always wondered if the depression that people see in mass today, there's so much depression that people mean there's a ca. It's a common trait. Like it's a common condition. Oh, he suffers from depression. Oh, she suffers from depression. Like, oh, he's got herpes. You know, you know what I mean? It's like, it's a, it's a common thing. I've always wondered or I've been wondering more and more recently. Um, it really hit me when have you ever seen a Heimos Arctic adventure? It was one of the first vice pieces that ever. So I think the first vice piece I ever saw, in fact, no, the first one was David Choe looking for a dinosaur in the Amazon or was he in the Congo?

Speaker 3:          00:51:20       I think it was in the Congo. David Choe. So fucking crazy. I love that guy. But he went to Africa, the guy's worth $100,000,000. We went to Africa looking for a fucking dinosaur. That definitely doesn't exist. But, but uh, vice has done some awesome stuff. But one of the things they did that was really interesting was this guy, his name is Huynh Mo. I think that's how you say it. Age. I am. Here it is heimos. Hi mo. I had an n in there I think heimos arctic refuge and this guy lives in this incredibly remote area of the arctic national wildlife refuge in the alaskan interior. And he, he lives in this really small log cabin and he hunts and gathers and that's all he does. And he's very smart. I think he's not a dummy at all and he's been up there. He lives with his wife and his.

Speaker 3:          00:52:17       He raised children up there and it's really, really. There's some dark moments in there because they lived like this from the time, like when they had children up there and they lost their two year old baby in a fucking canoe. Like they tipped over in A, in a canoe and lost their kid. And it's like it's a really intense when they revisit the site and leave flowers and it was like 30 years ago and they had several children since then, but this moment is still like this intense moment of loss for them where they lost their baby, but this fucking guy is very happy and very, very smart and very connected and very articulate and he firmly believes that human beings, when we evolved and developed and were hunter gatherers, that there's a set of rewards. There's reward systems that are set up Inside the human body, inside the.

Speaker 3:          00:53:10       The, the very being that we embody that don't get met in today's society. And tHat's one of the things that's causing depression. One of the things that's causing this funk that people are in is that we're living our lives. many of us, at least in these very unfulfilling ways where you're going to this office with artificial light and you're doing something you don't want to do all day long and then you get home and you're tired. And on top of tHat you're eating shit. You're eating potato chips and you're drinking soda and your body is just like, what in the fuck is this? We're supposed to be out in the fields were supposed to be walking up hills. We're supposed to be looking for aniMals or gathering vegetables were supposed to be doing all these things that our body is designed to do. We're supposed to be in nature and nature is like a medicine.

Speaker 3:          00:53:56       LIke it literally is a medicine to you. Like people. People that go, you don't have to go hunting, you don't have to go fishing. Just go fucking hike man. Just go hike up to the top of a mountain and look out. You know there's a reward that you get from that that Is intensely like soul filling. Just like something about like wHen I was in Colorado and there was this, this area of boulder where you drive up one of these roads and there's this area where you could park and it was this incredible view, man. These people just pArk and just go out there and just look, but you get there and you park and you go, fuck [inaudible]. You would see you, you literally seeing the continental divide and these snow capped mountains in july, july. It's covered with snow because those mountains, I don't

Speaker 1:          00:54:41       give a perspective. Oh, just this whole new perspective on it and I think nature, I think the ease of suffering is always in present in this. You know when you're in president is truly locked in and presidents, there is no suffering. There can be pain, but no suffering. Suffering is something created by our own minds and I think nature is one of the great ways to do this because humans, we learn, we take cues from our environment and nature. As I was saying earlier, is always in the present. You know there's this natural presidents of all the animals, everything around you. Whereas if you get around a bunch of people watching housewives and stressed about this and pop them pills, you're going to take on that energy too and you're gonna lose your present in this because of your surrounding. So it's like this ultimate regrounding tool where we get back to a present moment.

Speaker 1:          00:55:26       Again, that's such a fucking key element to human happiness and I think the other key element is having something where we're fighting for, we know, having a mission, I think we're all forces and that forest needs to have an effect, needs to have A reason that it's moving in a certain directioN and I think with all of our meats and all of our needs met, you knoW, where we don't have to hunt for food, we don't have to acquire everything. Everything's relatively easy and it's all about advancement and all this. We've lost a lot of the basic mission which was the mission to suRvive and procreate, you know, so. And we haven't replaced it with any other universal mission, which is I think one of the big allures of these things like wars and these things like creating an enemy. Well at least then you hAve a mission and when you have a mission, human beings are happy. You know, like a birch and russell talked about, he did book conquest of happIness and he had his own fucked up attributes. Every time I bring them up, people talk about is fucked up. And as he was into phonology and he might've been racist, whatever, but he was a good philosopher, smoke. But,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       but Anyways, he talked about the happiest person he knew, the happiest person he could find was a groundskeeper on a manner who every day woke up and was at war with the rabbits, have the guy he just declared that the rabbits were the fucking enemy. And he would go out with his gun and he would hunt as many as possible and he'd go morning till, till night, and he would kill as many rabbits as he could because it was the rabbits were the ones eating the hedges and the flowers and whatever. So he basically made the rabbits his enemy and struck out every single day to kill as many rabbits as possible. And that dude, according to bertrand russell, was happy as fuck. He had a task, he had a task, he had a purpose, you know, he had a mission. My mission is to destroy the rabbits. I just have a dog like that.

Speaker 2:          00:57:04       Yeah. I had the happiest dog over, his name was frank sinatra. And uh, he was a pit bull that all he lived for was killing lizards and my house, my old house, not the house now, but my old house had this, uh, one, um, it's like a on a hill and there's this one wall where these lizards would run up the wall. And so frank, I would literally let them out in the morning and he fucking bolt out that door. It's like time to go to war, like any would run and go look for these lizards. And he would stand there like eddie bravo. We'll just watch it. And marvel. He'd be like, fuck man, this dog does this every day there's, doc does this every day I go, this is what he loves to do. And he would go there and he would have his paws on the wall and crazy and he would jump up and try to grab a lizard and occasionally he would get one and he'd be like, fuck yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:57:53       And he would get one. They would go looking for another one. He would go and he was a pretty big yard. So he would go wandering around the yard looking for anything else that fucked up. Anything else that was slipping and it was constantly, unfortunately twice. I had to take him to the hospital because he got bit by rattlesnakes because rattlesnakes are slipping to. Apparently he killed the rattlesnakes, but the rattlesnakes fucked him up here. Like a water balloon grown out of the side of his head. Both of my dogs. It. By the way, that's a real problem. If you don't have the money to pay for the serum, it's super expensive. It was several thousand dollars to treat them for this rattlesnake venom. Antivenom shit. It's like. I was like, man, what if I was poor? What if a whole fucked up system like you. They inject horses with the venom and they like get the antibodies from the horses except this archaic system.

Speaker 2:          00:58:40       I think my friend Donald Schultz is working on. He's a big snake handler guy. He's working on ways to innovate around that because it's kind of like a real backwards system that they have. How you get antivenom? Well, a horse will survive, so let's just fucking sorta put the venom in there and then we'll get the antibodies from the horse and then, you know, it's, it's a weird. It's a weird thing how they do it. Yeah, well that's a real problem with people that are vegans. If you're a vegan, you don't use any animal products. You get bit by a rattlesnake, you got two choices. Compromise your morals. Well that's a wrap. Yeah. You know, um, but this dog was so goddamn happy. He had missions, you know, he would go out of that yard and he wasn't bored. He was really pleased to see me for a walk.

Speaker 2:          00:59:20       Come on man. He was like, see it dude. Don't opened that door. He was gone. He just had his little mission. And I think you can see that in the people who are the most unhappy. THey seem aimless. Like, what am I here for? Why am I doing this? Nothing makes sense. You know? And I've even felt it in my own life when, you know, I know what my mission here. My mission is to expand human consciousness, to help people be happy. Like that's really what I find my greatest purpose in. But every once in a while I'll get this kind of like fuck people attitude. Maybe someone said some fucked up shit and I'm like, man, people fucking suck for people. And then at that poem, that's when I'm actually depressed, you know, because I've lost my mission. Instead of having a mission, like, yes, my mission is human consciousness.

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       All of a sudden it's like fuck people, fuck that mission. THey'll figure it out and then I'm depressed because I've lost my purpose. It's very hard to rise above like literally when something like that happens and realize like, oh, you've just, you're, you're encountering one diseased individual. You've got to look at the mass of humanity. Like when you encounter one diseased individual, it's so like this guy who shot up that nightclub in orlando, you're, you're looking at one diseased individual and if you say, man, people fucking suck. Look at what they did. We'll look into how many people that are responding with rainbows on their twitter pages and love and, and, and all the best wishes to those folks that got killed that other. I mean I was looking at this guy's page who's a, an animal lover who was organizing people to go to the homes of the victims and see if they have pets that are trapped.

Speaker 2:          01:00:49       You know, there's this beautiful people out there. There's a lot, there's more beautiful pete. This is without a doubt, not just the safest, the easiest. This is the happiest time in terms of like being able to like reach out and, and, and send love to people and have people send love to you, but just occasionally you run into conc yeah, no, no, and the constant self. BuT the beauty is out there too. It's just not as dramatic and it doesn't impose upon us as forcefully, but we've, we just look. It's around all the time. We run into good people all the time, but you just make eye contact with that good person or that kid. He's just looking at you and just that little smile and you're like, oh yeah, the good of humanity. The fact that, you know, we really are love, you know, being expressed outwardly all the time and it's just these other delusions that get in the way of that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:37       Well, we're oddly attracted to negativity to. It's almost like we look at negativity online or that you run into is a possibility of war. Like you have to look at this fucking drums beating, goddammit. There's an army on the background. They're coming, they're coming. You know, it's like there's this real impulse to sort of batten down the hatches when really it's just some fucking 36 year old losers sit in his parents basement, you know, farting and smelling his own farts and angry online. I mean, that's really what a lot of you're dealing with. You're dealing with like really sick people, like people that have just, for whatever reason, they've not found their path. They've not found any happiness. They have found any fulfillment. They don't. They haven't found any growth there just stifled

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       or rotten and some sort of a weird way. It just hasn't really worked for them and so they're, they're lashing out, the lashing out at the world and you run into one of those people suck and that's the initial response and then the more conscious response is to look at and be and have compassion for that person. That is hard to do and our system isn't based upon that. Even if you look at the u s penal system, it's very much about punishment. Whereas if you watched that documentary that Michael Moore did, who to invade nest, where they go to Norway, they have a whole different idea of what the penal system is for. It's about restoring human dignity and cultivating a change. Really making change in the person. It's not about punishment, it's about. It's about actually changing that individual so he doesn't do it again, and then you look at the recidivism rates between our prisons and norway's prisons and they're just dramatically different.

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       That impulse to punish immediately, you know, is not the healthiest impulse. That's just gonna create more issues down the road. You're not rehabilitating anybody. You're just taking even more broken people and putting them out in the world and hoping they're not going to do the broken things. Well, it's not going to fucking work. You know, the right impulse is always that compassion and looking to see as if that was you, how all of these fucked up elements of the world and choices. I'm not overriding the fact that they had choices and all this. They're not free of guilt, but look at, look at that. Like this is the person that just made some bad choices and had some tough shit to deal with and couldn't overcome it. The resistance in the video game was higher than his skillset and he wasn't able to, to choose to work and choose to the positive elements that would allow them to overcome it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       you know, it's, it's also norway's dealing with far fewer people, you know, and that's, that's a good thing for them. And it's also they, they don't have that conquers mentality that we have. So when we were so wrapped up in success and also in punishment, I mean that, that is a big aspect of our culture. Like punishment and I mean like when anyone does anything wrong online, the amount of people that feel like it's their job to shame that person and embarrass that person and insult that person, it's pretty crazy to watch when something goes down. It's also, it's also counterproductive and I see that in the people shaming people for appropriation, right? So let's say for example, someone wears a head dress at a fucking festival, right? They're probably mildly. They're not doing it to mock the native americans, most likely, probably like a, a mild appreciation and interest.

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       I think this looks cool. I'm in a place and you know, and then all of a sudden they get all this intense hate and shame and putting all of this stuff, all of these intentions on them that weren't true. Again, going back to my point about morality, it's not about the act, it's about the intentions of the act, but right now we make it all about the act. Oh, you wore this headdress. That means you're insulting thousands of years of native americans. You're oppressing, you're appropriating Like, no, I fucking wasn't. I was wearing a fucking harris' headdress.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       But then all of a sudden that imprint will create trauma and that trauma will have a poisonous impact that will make them feel weird and make them want to do that to other people. So it's like you're in injecting someone with a, like a hate virus, you know, that they're going to then pass on to other people rather than doing the opposite, you know, spreading the love herpes where this contagious positivity that goes the other way and we have those choices with how to deal with people, but more often than not, we come with this thing to punish and create more trauma which triggers their own self judge and their own self hate, lowers their own self love. And then they're going to pass that off to kids, family members, people around them. You know, there's just two sets of dominoes that we can choose to take to take either pat and the concept of copd.

Speaker 2:          01:06:02       Cultural appropriation is so stupid because culture itself is bullshit. Culture itself is just a bunch of shit that people have done over and over again as a habit. Right? So your idea that no one should appropriate someone's other bullshit habits is so fucking ridiculous, like you shouldn't wear your hair like that because other dummies women wearing their hair like that for 100 years. Now they've decided thAt this is theirs. They own the dreadlock yeah. You know, or they own the braids. Are they? Oh, it's fucking nonsense. It's nonsense. And it's just one of those things that michael shermer likes to call virtue signaling where you see someone who's doing something and in chastising them you're not just trying to stop them from doing it. You're also letting the world know how ethical and how moral you are. And so you get a lot of like really goofy fucking white people who get mad at other white people for doing things that they deem to be cultural appropriation.

Speaker 2:          01:06:57       And it's one thing if you're deeply embedded and rooted in that culture, like um, what is that thing that a hindu people put on their forehead when they're in love in love? They put the third eye symbol on their head. I think it has something to do with love, or is it a bindi? Is that what it is you can be? Yeah. Well, I've, I've seen people get upset at people appropriating that and like, but what is that? You get, you get a sticker on your head, man, for real. Well, what about us? We're wearing tattoos clearly yet someone's culture. I mean the kind that we have is fairly american I guess, but my inner, like aaron dellavedova did mine and sort of a japanese style japanese tattoo on my ribs. Yeah. It's this sort of cultural appropriate in a time where we need all the best ideas ever.

Speaker 2:          01:07:46       You know what I mean? Like we need to bring everything that's good and everything that made sense and everything that can tap people back into something positive. we need all of that stuff. We don't need to. We need, so we need to gather all of the best practices of the culture. That's the fucking beautiful part of the time we're in. We can go eat moroccan food or chinese food or japanese food. We can go enjoy all of these things and we need all of this enjoyment because there's all kinds of other fucked up stuff that's going on as well that we have to deal with. So I mean, I, I just have such the opposite

Speaker 1:          01:08:17       idea that, you know, like tesla is doing with his patents, this idea of protect and hold. This is our own shit. Nobody else get it. That's to the detriment of the world. Like everybody should want to share all the ideas and best practices that they have to be like me secretly doing psychedelics. Right? Happy or not motherfuckers fuck you. You know, it doesn't make any sense. like you want to talk about it and say like, this is what worked for me. This is, hey, how can you, how can you improve yourself to, well, ironically, that's what people believe. The biblical scholars who have studied the connection between psychedelics and ancient religions that say believe where it all went wrong and so they tried to hold back the psychedelic rituals and hide them from conquering armies. And that's what john marco allegro believed that christianity was really initially all about.

Speaker 1:          01:09:06       It was about writing down these things in the bible, in parables and hiding them in these stories and that these stories were to mask it from the conquerors from being conquered by the roman army. Yeah, and then really the opposite is what they needed. They needed to share this open sources as widely as possible, so you look at that period. It's riddled with war and atrocities and all this fucked up stuff that's happened. It's in the human rights record and in the archaeological record, you know, cities built, destroyed, destroyed, barbarian, blah, blah, blah. Then you go take the counterpoint of that to a culture ancient shoving in Peru, which archaeologically has been shown that for 700 years there was no records of war in this region around shoving and shoving where the curators of the plant medicine, which enhances serotonin, very hard opening medicine I've talked about here on this podcast, but they would give it to everybody.

Speaker 1:          01:09:56       You just showed up. Maybe you brought a seashell as a gift. Maybe you didn't. Didn't matter. They would hold these open ceremonies for everybody who came. kings peasants doesn't. They didn't differ, differentiate. They were offering this to everybody and everybody was just more open and the records of war and the destructions destruction that it's just not there in the archaeological record and it has a lot to do. Obviously you can't prove causation, but the correlation between them open sourcing these psychedelic rituals to everybody and they're not being war for hundreds and hundreds of years is absolutely there and that's should it is where people went wrong because they tried to hoard information for power because that knowledge of course yields power. If you have the knowledge and only you have it, you'll have power over people who don't. Whereas real, you know, heart based power, leading with your heart forward, just open source all that.

Speaker 1:          01:10:47       Let it all sorted itself out. Yeah, it only makes sense that if you want the world that you live in, to be a better place. You've got to tell the things that have made. Tell people the things that have made your life better and things that made your life fucked up. Don't hide that shit either. Don't pretend like you're perfect and things don't fuck you up and everything is good. Like people need to hear all of it. Like, oh yeah, I tried this thing. It was fucking terrible. I wouldn't want to do that again, but

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       how could they possibly have known that thousands of years ago? You know what I mean? It's, I would love to have gone back in time. I would love to go back in time like several thousand years, just be invisible being some sort of invisible cone of protection and just sit down in a village, you know, in ancient days, in somewhere really populated area of the world, whether it's Greece or rome or wherever, and just try to try to take in what these fucking people are doing, how they were living and look at what they're essentially like. They're not just our ancestors. There was, I think we can look at ancient cultures in ancient societies and see if we look back and see all of their weird crazy stories and traditions and the way they sort of established the government and would look at what we're doing now. And if you sort of extrapolate deep into the future like where were.

Speaker 2:          01:12:08       These are all the. This is just not that long ago, it's a small little blip in time and there's obviously some sort of a process going on, some sort of a process of improvement and have a of innovation and some sort of a weird way innovation of culture and society and communication and I think that's one of the things that we're dealing with now with this age of information and all the data that we have to sift through and all the communication that we have to sift through. We're becoming some new thing and it's happening in our lifetime and it's happening in a really fucking confusing way and it's one of the things that make people yearn for the past. It makes people yearn for the good old days. You know, it makes a slogan like donald trump's keep America or make America great again.

Speaker 2:          01:12:54       What the fuck does that mean? It's never been better. It's never been better than right now. It would make America great again. Like how could it be greater? Like when has it ever been better than right now for anybody? This is the safest time. This is the most communication. There's the most information available, there's the most medicine available. You medical science can save people. you can live healthier lives. We know more about nutrition, we understand more about the body, like when was it better? Yeah, and still we're in this weird transitional period that I think we all can, can notice because truth hasn't percolated down to the rest of the rest of society. It's and it's a frustrating point. Like we know that people should not be getting thrown in jail for marijuana. That's not a debatable facts. Like the act of throwing them in jail is bad for the person.

Speaker 2:          01:13:39       The act of taking the marijuana is not bad for society. There's the truth is there, but still we're in this lag. The lag is really frustrated people because you know, but that's just the. That's just the nature of it. It's like when you go from switching from mcdonald's to starting to eat healthy and drinking kale shakes, the body doesn't respond instantly. You know, you have to be patient with the body like it's not just because you change your mind. The mind is instant. you can change your mind and instantly it's changed, but the body is different and so a society like it's going to take awhile for truth to percolate all the way through and in the process

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       like if you switch from mcdonald's to going on a juice fast, you're going to feel like shit. You know all the toxins are going to come up. Everything is going to bubble up through the body and you're going to have this massive detoxification period where you actually feel worse than if you had just continued to eat mcdonald's all the time because the body's going to go through the process of at reacclimating to a new way and I think we're in a little bit of that stage now where a truth is come out and a lot of different aspects of things, but it hasn't percolated all the way through. So we're going through this kind of societal detox where we have an applied the knowledge that is that is there readily available. I have feelings on the tour. I think that a lot of this resistance to new knowledge, new information, and even the resistance to freedom, like the marijuana laws and a lot of the things that we deeply deeply disagree with, that this is all in some sort of a way fueling change that the resistance actually fires people up and makes them more motivated to move forward and actually it actually strengthens the resolve of the resistance.

Speaker 3:          01:15:14       To know that there's so much ignorance out there in the world. Like when some slob like chris christie starts going on about nonsense saying how dangerous marijuana is, and meanwhile he's kalille abusing the fuck out of his meat vehicle. I mean that guy. If anybody should not talk about health and consequences of negative actions. It's someone who's morbidly obese who's already gone through fucking stomach surgery and still morbidly obese, but that guy, whether he knows it or not, as ignorant statements, has fueled a massive amount of resistance. There's people that have like fucking doubled down on their resolve because of the stupid shit that he said and it actually fuels things in a, in a positive way and in a horrible way. Even a mass killing of gay people like what happened to orlando, horrible, terrible tragedy, but ultimately that's not going to stop people from being gay.

Speaker 3:          01:16:09       What it's gonna do is it's going to fuel all the people like you and me who have nothing but love and acceptance for everybody regardless of your sexual persuasion. To double down on that and to get that out more and that's where all the people on twitter and instagram and facebook and all the social media posts about love and respect and and not giving a fuck. And I've seen, I don't know how many fucking memes from that bit that I did about this. Two reasons to hate gay marriage. You know, you're. You're either dumb or you're secretly worried. That dixit delicious. That is fucking all over the place. After one of these things happen and that and then a million other ones like it and a million other rainbows and hearts in the shape of a rainbow and it's people doubled down on their acceptance, double down the result.

Speaker 3:          01:16:57       And there might be some people that were on the fence that might've had some negative ideas about gay people and see all this and go, man, you can't fucking kill people in a nightclub just because they're gay. That's crazy. And then they might open their mind a little bit and then they might read a little bit more and then they might see an interview with some gay people that are holding hands and go, well, why do I give a fuck? Like, what is this? What religion? What some ancient stupid tradition. Is it cultural appropriation? Like, what is it? You know, what, what is it about this idea that people should or shouldn't love people of one sex or another sex? And if they do love them, they definitely shouldn't fuck them. You know, I love you. Like we're, we're really good friends. We've never fucked. I hope we never do. But you know what I'm saying? Like what it. Why would anybody care if you love somebody and then you wind up touching your body with them and pleasuring each other. Like to some people that becomes this taboo worthy of violence. That's a nonsense point of view that is highlighted by horrific acts and these horrific acts, it's horrible, despicable as they are in fact fuel people to be more open and more understanding. It's like the more you push back, the more the resistance grove.

Speaker 1:          01:18:08       Yeah, and that's a point that you always fall back on. It's absolutely a hundred percent right. I mean the obstacle is the way these things that in any video game you need resistance in order to test your skills and improve, you know, in a weight room you need gravity and the additional weights to stress your body so that you respond. And that's the same case with, with all of these elements. We underestimate the value of resistance. And that's a great constant reminder like, yeah, there's a lot of fucked up things that happened, but that resistance will allow us to cultivate our own consciousness and our own love and a much greater way than, than if it wasn't there. You know? And so in a loT of ways to really grow, you have to seek out, you have to seek out resistance in your own life and society. You know, it'll come naturally in society, but put yourself up against your own fears to grow and put yourself up against it, and when these things do happen, they are a great natural things that you can rally behind and then bring forth your best asset attributes and best aspects because that's what. That's what allows us to grow its resistance. Absolutely. I mean that's what working out is. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:19:15       pretty obvious. Like if you don't train hard, your body does not grow. If you don't put forth effort, your body does not get stronger. You don't get more endurance unless you push yourself. There's only one way and it's you got to go through something hard in order to get something good out of it. There's no other way. And that's one of the weirder things about being a person.

Speaker 1:          01:19:35       Yeah, and really it comes down to people also. One of the things that I've been ranting about a lot lately is choice. You know, and people this, we live in a society that loves to take choice from us and say, all right, everything is a disease. Everything is privilege. Everything is this thing. You know, you really didn't have a choice because there were these preconceived conditions and and it really, it's robbing us of choice because with, if we accept our inherent superpower, which is choice, then we have responsibility for who we are and if we have responsibility for who we are, all of us have such a harsh self judge that every failing we have, if we say, well, it was up to us, the judge just beats us to death about it. So we'd rather shrug our responsibility and go with our hands up to the judge.

Speaker 1:          01:20:19       Judge, it wasn't my fault, it wasn't my fault because we have such a harsh self judge in our own head that, that we intend to do that. So we, we give up our inherent superpower, which is choice because we don't want to take the responsibility, but at any point we can take that back and you have to deal with the judge and you deal with the judge by making a pact to always forgive yourself. Forgive yourself for any of the fucked up things that have happened and just accept that we're all imperfect. This idea of perfection is nonsense. We're all gonna fuck up. We're all gonna make mistakes, and so the judge is, this is nonsense. You know, it's like we're all gonna have come to the place we are, you know, through any variety of channels and where it's going to be an imperfect path, no matter what.

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       So continued to pound that own message of self love and forgiveness and then re harness that element of choice so that we can then decide what we want to be, who we want to be, what we want to go and put our intent. Fourth and yeah, and maybe not everything is possible, but what better thing to do then tend to fail in the cause of your greatest wish and your greatest intention in your greatest desire. I mean, that's the ultimate warriors death. That's what they would talk about with vala to find an enemy worthy enough to kill me in battle. That was the the ultimate idea, and we can all choose those battles and choose that thing that we're fighting for and fuck, if we fail, so what? But at least if we're going out on that way, you know, we'll go out with a smile 100 percent of the time, but it starts with really harnessing that choice

Speaker 2:          01:21:47       and the worst people that you know are the people that don't have a good self judge that everything they do is awesome. Yeah. Those motherfuckers never grow anywhere, right? I mean, that's a huge issue with comedy. Um, when you run into people thAt have terrible comedy sets but think they did great. Like we would always, greg fitzsimmons and I would always talk about that with like open miker. So there's people that hear phantom labs, like they think they're doing great and they have this delusional self opinion where everything they do is awesome and they don't know why they're not successful already. They know why they're not famous. And those people, I believe in some sort of a weird narcissistic way. You could look at it this way, that those people are there to teach you. This is the consequences of not feeling that awful feeling when you fail. Well, that comes from the ego being so fragile that their ego is so fragile that they can't accept the fact that they may have not done a good job. so they will manufacture ideas in their heads so that they did a good job no matter what, because their ego can't take the truth of the blow. Like, man, you fucking bombed out

Speaker 1:          01:22:51       there. So it comes from insecurity and fragility and then they create this ridiculous story in their head about what it is because they can't withstand that truth because ultimately I think it all comes from the same thing. Lack of self love.

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       That lack of ability to be like, man, I fucking shit the bed and I'm okay. Everything's okay. I'll be all right with, you know, you know, but the good ones can, you know, I was talking to bur, um, couple of weeks ago he did a set at the comedy store and I saw part of it. It was a, he was killing and then I ran into him in the hallway and uh, I go, oh man, main room show was great, right? And he goes, I fucked up. At the end thOugh, I tried to hang in there too long. The last pit bomb, like he was just, it was a rotten adam that the last bit like he goes, I fucking hung in there too long. I should have got off of the bit before that puck, you know, like, but you know, when I was in there he was fucking killing you know.

Speaker 3:          01:23:45       But that wasn't in his mind. The success was not in his mind. This was like, okay, whatever that happened at the end, don't fucking do that again. But that's why he's bill burr. That's why he's really good. And because he's so, he's, he's able to take that feeling, but at a certain point he'll be able to have a beer or drink or whatever, you know, dinner and just laugh about it and he's not going to carry that. Trauma exists forever. It's just like feel it, like fuck, I could almost had it and that's healthy. But then it ultimately you have to have that moment of forgiveness really like, yeah, fuck it. Of course. Well that's the beauty of being a comic as opposed to being a fighter. Because the comic can have that moment and just the next night go on stage and I'm sure he killed were my.

Speaker 3:          01:24:25       He was killing like he's a super self critical guy, so whatever the bad moment at the very end it was probably just fairly, you know, like less funny than normal. You know what I mean? I'm sure it was funny, but like for a fighter, like, like here's a perfect example, someone like luke rockhold who just got knocked out one round by michael bisping, he's got a fucking rot with that. That's kind of chew away at him. That mistake that he made for months and months and months until he gets back in there again. And even if he wins his next fight, he didn't win that fight. That fight is still there. The fight still gonna be chewing away at him and if he's smart he'll keep that. That's a, that's a little engine that when he's thinking about like when he's at the top of the hill and he's like, has got to be the last sprint.

Speaker 3:          01:25:16       That engine with like wrong bitch. Michael bisping knocked you out and he mocked you. And it'll get right back to the bottom of that hill and hopefully he won't blow his joints out and break his body with that kind of motivation because that also can happen to people where they. Their Motivation sort of it out, pushes the physical capacity of their meat vehicle. That's a possibility too. You got to be real careful with that, but. But that even though it seems like a terrible thing that happened to him is not just a good thing for him, it's a good thing for all martial artists. It's a good thing to understand. You are a human being. Your jaws made out of bone. Your skin is made out of flesh. The nerves are just like anybody else's nerves. If you get cracked by a left hook, the way michael bisping cracked, luke rockhold, you're going night, night, everybody goes night and unless

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       your market, and it just seems to be pretty fucking tremendous shots. It just, it goes back to that idea that the act is neither good nor bad. It's how you respond to it. You don't like another coop. Carlos castaneda, he had a great quote that for the ordinary person in everything, his blessing or curse, but for the warrior, they're only challenges and and that's really applies the fighting at this point. That was neither a blessing nor curse that he got knocked out by michael bisping and his response to it. Is he going to respond like gsp did when he got knocked out by matt serra and ringing. Oh, revolutionized his fighting style and become the legend that we know them today. You know? Yeah. Maybe the old gsp was more exciting, but it carried way more risks. So we adapted any became better and you know, he became this indomitable force.

Speaker 2:          01:26:49       See, I don't even think the regular gsp was more exciting that I, I, you know, exciting to me is a weird term. Like when I look at the gsp that destroyed bj penn or john fitch, that motherfucker was pretty god damn exciting and that's post matt. Matt serra I think, but the matt serra a analogy is a perfect one because it's the same sort of thing. who's fighting a dangerous guy that he underestimated. And by the way, both of them won the ultimate fighter, so it's perfect. Perfect analogy. And both of them were huge underdogs and both of them went on to win with spectacular first round knockouts. You gotta respect everybody and human beings that are professional fighters. Even if you think you're better than them, they have weapons, man, they take people out, they all have. And you're a person, but you think that because you beat chris weidman, you destroyed leo machida, you beat the fuck out of all these people and you strangled bisping.

Speaker 2:          01:27:41       The first time you met him. Me like, there's no way this guy's going to beat me. No way. It's impossible. And so you go in there super relaxed. And I remember when I was competing in the taekwondo dates, if I was relaxed and I didn't feel nervous, I felt like shit. Yeah, it was terrible feeling like I, I only fought well when I was scared. And I think that's a, that's a really important point for almost anybody you know, you, you really have to have some element of danger involved in, in the contest, if that's not there. If you just like, you can't do shit to me, you can't do shit to me, and all of a sudden, boom, that left hook lands and your legs go well, that's the. That's a key characteristic of being in flow state that the stakes have to be high.

Speaker 2:          01:28:23       Like everybody uses surfing as an analogy. Well you can serve some baby ass waves, some two foot waves and a sand bottom and you're not going to get in flow state. You're just going to be kind of paddling and cruising around, but you surf that gnarly fucking double overhead on a reef, on a coral reef, bottom fuck out of here and in flow state, let alone what like laird hamilton is doing, surfing those monsters when the stakes are high and you're really feeling that that's what drives you to your highest performance level. So shane dorian coming in next week, oh shit, can't wait. Talk to that guy about sharks and shit. Guys, I'm an admin and he's a bow hunter to it should be a lot of fun,

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       but yeah, these people that are, that are doing really exciting, really dangerous things, they carry with them the consequences of those really exciting, really dangerous things like occasionally you're gonna fail and when you fail this, an important to know that you can fail. It's importAnt to know that no matter how much you have mastered whatever you're trying to do, there are consequences to every zig and zag. Yeah, you know, it's just really about mastering the ego. The ego is the main thing that thwarts you on either side. It gives you this false sense of confidence and importance. I remember I was recently reading a ryan holiday's new book. Ego is the enemy and he has the story of the persian king, xerxes, you know, who is a mortalized in 300 and whatnot, and this guy was such an egomaniac. It makes sense that he got his ass kicked, you know, repeatedly.

Speaker 1:          01:29:49       So they were building bridges over this canal. It's as the story that historians wrote and the water came up there. Storm came in storm surge and it wiped out the bridges. Well then he ordered his men to take his chains and lash the water 30 times as punishment, you know, for, for knocking down the bridge. And he cut off the people's heads. Who made the bridge? Right? Oh, so this fucking ego maniac. And then another storY where he, he's trying to build this tunnel under a mountain and he sends a letter to the mountain, has his emissaries go out to announce this letter to the mountain saying to the mountain mountain, if you give us any trouble, I will move you piece by piece into the sea king xerxes. What the fuck you talking about? You know, so no, just no acknowledgment. He's been fed his own bullshit so much that he's just, he thinks he's god and he plays that role and then he runs into 300 bad motherfuckers at the hot gates that their marbly and they just wipe out half of his forces because he's just.

Speaker 1:          01:30:47       He can't fucking see beyond it. And there's so many ways that ego does that either inflates you or it makes you too fragile or you know, and that's really, if you're going to be good at anything, you got to have to come and confront that, confront that beast. Listen, isn't it? The problem with royalty to is that it's just sort of bestowed upon you. It's not earned. And so you have this distorted perception of your own greatness, right? That's sort of, you could say that about a lot of hot chicks. Yeah. Royalty or like reality tv stars. It's the same thing. You have all of this bestowed upon you for some mysterious combination of luck and timing and whatever. But royalties. The weirdest example of it, you know, I was at disneyland a few weeks back with my family and uh, I was talking to this guy that works there and he was talking about this five year old boy who was a prince from some middle eastern country. And he came here with this huge group of guardians and watchers or whatever it was, but they were all at his beck and call. And so this five-year-old was telling all these adults what he wanted, when he wanted, what he wanted done, and they all just scrambled and randall and he was saying like, it was so bizarre watching all these people

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       at the wrath terrifying of the wrath of a five year old boy and that this five year old boy wielded just fucking like supernatural power house. And he never earned any of it. He's like, he was just born a five year old boy who's born this little child and now he's lived for five years. He's just a boy. That's all he is. Didn't that never done shit?

Speaker 1:          01:32:22       Yeah. But they're all like, you know, I actually have a really unique perspective on that because my parents split when I was two and very quickly to worlds develop. My dad was wealthy commodities trader and I was his only child on that side. My mom remarried to a swat team, squad leader who had three older boys, you know. So those were my older stepbrother. So at my dad's house I was the little prince. My dad was busy trading and doing his thing and I had either body guards or other people around and I could feel I could, would develop these punk tendencies that come from that, from having basically servants taking care of me at the time, and then I'd go back to my mother's house and I split time half the week I go back to my mother's house and my three older stepbrothers would just beat the punk out of me.

Speaker 1:          01:33:11       Literally like, what the fuck are you doing? You're like, you're being ridiculous here. And so it allowed me this perspective where I didn't get to go and follow down that path too long because it's, it's so alluring. You know, if you have power, you're going to take it, you know, especially if you're young, you know, I got all this power, oh, I'm not going to take it. I'm a five year old, but I know what's right. And I know, you know, if you can do that and you can push those buttons, you're for sure going to push those buttons as a kid. So it's important to, to have that balance. Fortunately for me, I had the other side to keep me, keep me in check because I serve, I surely would have been a fucking menace if I had just gone down that perfect older stepbrothers two, not brothers stepbrothers.

Speaker 1:          01:33:54       Sure. So they have no problem beating the shit out of it. I remember one time I came, they bought us all paintball guns and I remember my, one of my older stepbrothers just laid in wait behind a wall like this. We were on the property and you could hear me coming and just shot me point blank in the fucking face. Paint ball gun just lit me up, you know. And that's the thing, like obviously at the time I was not happy about it, but this you learn, you learn things about the world and you get like a different toughness that comes from that form of resistance that if I didn't have that I wouldn't be nearly the balance person. I was uh, you know, I am now. I'm not fucking, I'm not perfect or balanced or anything, but that certainly helped.

Speaker 3:          01:34:36       Yeah. I think competition is good for that to failure. Losing, you know. Um, especially individual one on one type competition when you realize the consequences of not working hard and you run into someone who has worked hard, you know, I remember my competing days, I had a chance to see some, uh, when I was 19 I went to the olympic training center

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       and there was the world cup in Colorado springs and I got to see like the best of the world compete and I remember seeing like this insanely high level and it was one of the most important things as far as like my development as a competitor, like seeing the top of the food chain, seeing the best guys and realizing like fuck, look how hard they work. Like jesus christ. I was watching them train. I was watching guys compete and I was realizing like I'm not nearly as dedicated as these people are. I'm not nearly as. I have to ramp it up like in a big, big, big fucking way. And seeing that and comparing yourself against other people's efforts and realizing that your fall short so critical for people. It's so critical to to realize like, oh, that guy would fuck me up, like look, because if you're that five-year-old prints that five-year-old prints probably has no idea that someone could beat his ass, you know, he probably just thinks he just gets to yell at you and you have to get on your knees and start bowing and lowering your head and if you, if you don't experience other people's efforts, if you don't experience like a real competition where you see people pushing themselves as far as they can to try to win a race where you see the last few meters of the race where guys, you could see it in their face, the fucking struggle.

Speaker 2:          01:36:19       If you never do that, if you never do that, if you never push to that very edge of physical capacity, then you don't. You don't really understand what's out there. It's like one of the reasons why people who have never had a, any martial arts experience at all or don't know how to fight at all gets so weird around confrontation with men. I mean, how many times have you been around men who don't know how to fight, but all of a sudden they get a few drinks in them and they start yelling at people and talking crazy shit. It's like they don't know what to do. It's almost, they're like confused and so they're. They're almost inviting their own doom. They're almost like sending out a bat signal for someone to punch them in the face. It's almost like a subconscious thing where they want someone to kick their ass because they kind of know that they're so unbalanced in their approach.

Speaker 2:          01:37:07       The fight club moment, like they're running a light, their own place on fire and beat themselves up just to get that attribute out. But you see that. And the other thing is where people just don't take the idea that there may be consequences to their actions to heart. Like I had a perfect example of this. I was after partying with an ex gamer, I won't mention anything farther than that, but an x game guy, super successful like 20, like 20 year old kid and he's been so successful for so long. One of those child prodigies, right? And We go and he's, he's over at my apartment downtown in austin and we were having fun and he continues to. He goes in immediately puts on his music. Then he cranks it all the way up to full volume. I'm like, yo man, we got neighbors. You can't do that shit. You know, you can't crank it up. He's like, okay. And then he goes and he does it again. And he goes and he does it again and I keep warning.

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       I'm like, man. So finally, like time number five, I go up to him, I go, you turn the fucking volume up, shit's gonna, get real. And I looked at him with a total different tone and then he looked at me like, oh my god, I didn't think that that consequences of my actions was even a fucking feasible possibility. Like that moment of like, oh shit, this other dude may punch me if I fucking do this again and be that disrespectful. It was like for him, he had surrounded himself with other people in this environment where just having respect for somebody in the consequences for repeated disrespect might actually be. There was like a, a world changing moment for him or he looked up like, oh shit, this is weird. Yeah, I'm royalty. Yeah, exactly. You don't punch me. Exactly. And then after that he was like, shook by it and he kept saying, oh man, you know, no disrespect, blah blah blah. But he needed that moment of like, look bro, fucking shit Will get real. There are consequences, you know, this is not some fucking fantasy land here. You know? And then that moment totally changed, totally changed things, but people don't get those when they don't have that resistance, they don't have the older stepbrother, they don't have that person that can step in and be like, yo fucking knock, knock that shit. Attention to the other people to just do what you want. exactly.

Speaker 3:          01:39:13       You know, there's a thing about like, not necessarily just x gamers, but people that do these extreme sports. There's a lot of these guys are like, um, I don't want to say like pranksters, but they, they revel in annoying people and pissing people off and the attention that they get from it is real strange, strange, like sort of a vibe that comes with a lot of bmx jumpers and all these crazy fucks that do a lot of risky shit. They have that sort of personality trait where they're constantly pushing the envelope and some sort of a strange way. You know, they, they, they like people pissed that I'm mad. You mad a,

Speaker 1:          01:39:52       it may come from the fact that particularly skateboarders, they're constantly getting persecuted by lame ass authority figures telling them not to skate on their fucking hand rails. Some banker comes that don't scare on my hand rails kid you fucking punk, you know, instead of constantly being chased around by people who are dummies and so maybe it develops this kind of like counter, you know, this, this reaction. So that reaction of being persecuted for doing what they're enjoying to do creates this like, fuck the man. Yeah. but maybe

Speaker 3:          01:40:20       maybe they should yell at them. Like if I was fucking walking down that some dude came flying down the rail and broke my leg. I be like, you piece of shit. Like a lot of those guys are fucking nuts, man. And they'll put people in danger, like I've seen some crazy stunts on youtube where these dudes jump on top of these railings and slide them to the bottom and fuck up and plow into people. Like the world is not an x game. Like you can't just, you can't just do that with a bunch of other people around. But some of those folks care,

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       certainly not. And I think you, we appreciate that. Not giving a fuck like no. Johnny, knoxville and steve. Oh steve, he's still doing it. He's, he's like deep in his thirties. You still climbing up on top of gigantic towers and cranes and shit and risking his life. Man. He fell off of a billboard. He was climbing up on top of a billboard to shit on seaworld to change. uh, a street sign. What's is 42? Is he jesus christ. You can break a lot of shit falling from that high. And he fell. He's just so ridiculous. He's hilarious though. He also did something that I was kind of trying to tell them not to do. He had tim kennedy choke them out on it is a showtime special. Tim kennedy choked him out. He went completely unconscious and balanced his head off the ground called blanca. I mean, you mean if you ask tim kennedy to choke you out, you're going to sleepy sleep, sleep, sleep. That's deeper than red. Is there a video that. Oh, jesus christ here. Let's play it, man.

Speaker 4:          01:42:03       Silica. This.

Speaker 2:          01:42:05       Oh my god. There's no sound. Okay, so he's not just choking him. He's choking them for quite a feW seconds. He's already out. Likely that that is not cool. Like tim shouldn't have done that. Like right there, that drop. That is a fucking huge head wound like to to drop and bounce your head off the ground like that. That is really bad. Really. tim should let that dude down. A little lighter. That's probably steve o's agreements. Diva wanted it to be fucking savage. Maybe you think he asked for that. He didn't know then. Well, tim should have known him. Doesn't give a fuck. He's been knocked out. No, he doesn't give a fuck if someone tells them to do it. Yeah. Got. It's got a lot of that wolfington oh, what like 70 percent will get the joke out and drop you for sure. He has hashtag hard to kill on like half of his fucking posts.

Speaker 2:          01:43:01       He, he, he put a fucking post out with isis giving his address. I don't know, like, come get me bitch. I don't know. He's a. I mean I've gotten to know him really well because he trains at on an academy so I see them coming through there all the time and just the sweetest dude too. Great. And he shows up like no chip on his shoulder. No, like you've comes in wearing silly little shorts and a fanny pack and just a big old smile on his face and a silly fucking mustache and he just, he's got nothing to prove. But then he has that switch, you know, obviousLy where

Speaker 2:          01:43:34       he can do whatever access, whatever that place is. That fucking wolf heart. is this a new post of his jamie that you put up? It says, my friends and I are just kicking back waiting for the call when we can fight these bastards the way we need to and not go to jail. Hashtags still serving. Hashtag hard to kill. Let us know when it's time. He's got his shirt off with an axe with one of those ridiculous. What are those things called guy fawkes. Beard and mustache. Yeah, it is. Yeah, like musketeers, three musketeers style. He's, he's an animal, but we need people like that. This, this, this. That's the extreme on the, uh, on the warrior end of the spectrum. That's the extreme, you know, the, the flamboyant warrior. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:44:20       The thing that you can really appreciate is the truth of it. Like it cuts all the way through to the core. You know, the peopLe that are, that you shake them a little bit and some other person emerges and you shake them again, like a fucking magic eight ball.

Speaker 2:          01:44:33       That's gonna come out. Like those are the people that are the worst. Tim, it's tim. Tim, it's tim. You shake it again. It's a little slightly angry or tim.

Speaker 1:          01:44:41       It's the same fucking guy. And that's, that's always a beautiful thing when you see it. People have dealt with those deeper things, they've reconciled all these forces that, you know, you're not going to put them in a situation where this other person emerges and you're like, what the fuck is this selfish piece of shit

Speaker 2:          01:44:55       guy? You know? Yeah. And this is also something that we were talking about earlier when you were talking about people like the, the camaraderie and the craziness of going to war, that they actually enjoy it and become happy there and some sort of a weird way because life becomes real because life becomes real in this chaotic moment. There was a ta, I think it was a ted radio hour. It might have been a radiolab podcast. I think it was a ted radio hour, but they were talking to someone who there were talking to soldiers and they were talking to people about happiness. Like what makes you. It wasn't ted show, it was a ted talk and it was. They were talking about happiness and I'm. One of the things they got into was these people that went over to Iraq and Afghanistan and served and they would come back and talk about it and they said it was horrific. It was chaotic. It was scary, but it was the happiest days of my life and one of the reasons why I was the happiest days of their life was this intense bond and comradery that they had developed with these other people that they were serving. With. That there was nothing like it. There's no sort of closeness and bond of brotherhood that even comes close to the bond of brotherhood when you need to rely on these people and they rely on you for your very life and you're taking other people's lives.

Speaker 1:          01:46:11       Yeah. I think that's a huge missing piece in our society and I think a few people get to access it on sports teams and, and on different, you know, and obviously in war, but I think that tribal element of going through these shared rites of passages and going through these things that bonded a group together so that you really had true altruistic love for more of the more people around you. You know, I think that's a deep calling that we've kind of ignored, you know, like those soldiers would truly fight and die for each other, which is the epitome of altruism. It's wanting the other person's good even at the cost of your own, you know, and, and that's a feeling that I think feels inherently the best. It's our natural state to be this like the son of love, you know, like, uh, like Just pouring it out and not deciding who gets a bit truly feeling that way about a group of people.

Speaker 1:          01:47:02       And I think there's, you know, as we develop. I think that's one of the concepts that I'm always talking about is recreating some kind of tribal element where you do go through these rites of passage and it doesn't have to involve war, which is inherently an unsustainable and unnecessary practice, but how do you create that same closeness, but do it through ritual, do it through, you know, going and climbing this mountain and taking the psychedelic, however you want to do it in a way that can bond you together with the group so you have those feelings where there's no, there's nothing. You're holding back. Your truth is completely exposed. You're naked with all your intentions and thoughts and ideas and you just truly want the best for another individual and and that tribe, that feeling of tribe. That's what tribe is and I think we're missing that. We have this ourselves in the small nuclear unit and then we have this whole wide world which is too big to really care to that degree about and we're missing the intermediary, which is Just this band, this group, this family that were willing to do anything for.

Speaker 2:          01:48:03       Yeah, and then obviously expanding that even further from your media group to the rest of the human race. Yeah. So difficult to even conceptualize when tim kennedy fought, there was a fight for the troops and um, I believe it was in Texas. Was that where it was? He fought half natal and he knocked him out and this was like, I don't think they even captured this on film. Tim hopped on top of the fence and he was just calling out to all the troops. I mean, I really don't think. I don't know if the camera's caught this or not, but he was pointing to everybody who's just telling them he loved them. He's like, I love you guys. I love all you guys. I was pointing at people, I love you guys. And then like what, what he was doing, he served. He's fought. I mean he's, he served in combat many, many times. He's still serving now that the reality of like his expression and his love for those people, it was very, very intensely moving. It was one of the most intensely moving post-fight speeches or post-fight celebrations I've ever expect. Not not one of the most that I've ever experienced

Speaker 1:          01:49:15       and they, they were pushing so much energy back them chanting and it was tense. ReallY amazing moment. I mean, you imagine those, you read about those moments in history where the great leaders come in and have that moment with their, with their troops, you know, and you don't see that now in today's warfare, you know, there's no, there's no that, that independence day moment right now where they give that rousing speech and everybody's just pounding their chest and you know, that was. That's something that's really deeply, deeply moving and powerful and to have that, you need

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       to have that force of resistance that you're all allied against, your all banded together against that, that other thing, and it's just choosing a thing that is truly worthy of, of your fight. So choosing to fight against something that's not just another people or another race or all the stupid things that we choose to fight against, but choosing to fight against something truly worthy of that fight. Yeah, and this, this thing to them, to these soldiers was this concept of the enemy being a truly evil force, you know, whether it's isis or whether it's anything else like these guys were all united against it and to have tim kennedy as this person who's like a figurehead representing them and win by knockout in a military base in such a spectacular fashion on television and understanding all the weight behind all that because there are cameras.

Speaker 2:          01:50:41       It is being televised. It is being broadcast all throughout the world that will be available for ever on the internet and you know, through the ufc fight pass archives. You'll always be able to watch that. And when he, when he connected with that left hook and the crowd fucking roared and natal went out. It was nuts, man. It was nuts. You know, you like history, especially the history of rome, which I'm most familiar with. There was always these moments in time where a leader would naturally emerge like that for whatever reason, and then it would always made the emperor is really squirrely because at any point in time that person could all of a sudden be like, yep, my army now bitch deal with, you know, obviously that can't happen in that time. But if tim said, you know, if tim after that Jumped off the cage and said, follow me, like, fucking all of them, be like, yeah, fuck it.

Speaker 2:          01:51:30       I'm going to tim, tim kennedy and brian stann run for president. I'm in. Totally. I'm in. I'll campaign. I'll fucking, I'll follow them around the country. We know that's what we need. We need someone who understands the realities and the consequences of what these people in these hallowed halls of justice are trying to pull off all throughout the world. Instead of having these old chicken hawks or sydney's has a hose. Was. It was from. There was one of the best quotes from the documentary on hunter s thompson where he was, uh, talking to. It wasn't ed muskie. It was a mcgovern and mcgovern was saying I'm sick of old venn in air conditioned buildings, sending young men to go off and die in war, and that's, that's really one of the most despIcable aspects of the decision making process by quote unquote leaders is that there their consequences are so minimal.

Speaker 2:          01:52:33       I mean if, if every single politician and leader had to be at the head of the army, had to go to the fray, had to be on the front lines. How many actual wars where we get into or serve, let's say they weren't Capable of fighting, but at least they'd have to serve at the frontline hospital so that every person with like for a week, you know, you're at the front lines, you're just a nurse assistant, you know, so everybody coming back blown up, shrapnel you know, sent. Can you pass this message to my sweetheart, tell this to my mother. Like they're receiving that. So at least they have to get in touch with it and, and understand the consequences of what they're doing. But it's easy to get this sociopathic kind of mindset like, oh, these are just pieces of those, you know, those like the conquest boards, it looked like big chess boards you see in all of game of thrones or whatever know I moved my troops here, I move.

Speaker 2:          01:53:27       this becomes all strategy. But you lose the humanity of it, you know, you lose that connection with really who you're dealing with. And those moments are incredibly important to, to really keep the thing going and keep. Keep you, keep you in line. Yeah. And people would say, well, if they did do that, what would it be? Impossible the way we need it and the way we do it now. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, don't do it that way. You fuck. I'm trying to say it's one of the main problems with, with war and with leadership is that the people that are in charge at the very top and a lot of ways are behaving like that five year old boy at disneyland is a prince. They have too much power with no consequences. They have too much power that essentially they haven't really earned. You know, when you've got a guy like jocko willink who, uh, was a real military hero who is over there commanding when that guy talks about the military or talks about war or talks about actions, the respect is that you don't need to respect him.

Speaker 2:          01:54:27       You're going to respect him. You got to understand that this is a guy who's been there and you're going to listen because it's real. When a guy like dick cheney started talking about military actions, you're dealing with some fucking weird detachment from the reality and consequences of war from a guy who during the Iraq invasion a lot of the times was in a bunker member, that member, they would talk about him being in some underground bunker and I was always like, why is dick cheney in the bunker? And george w dot bush is on tv. I will fuck is running this country for real. But these guys that got multiple deferments like dick cheney did to avoid actually serving in the war. I mean, I think he got several deferments to avoid having to actual see, actually see real combat. Those are not the people that she'd ever be able to make those kinds of decisions to put people in harm's way.

Speaker 2:          01:55:22       They just shouldn't be able to. You need a guy like jocko. You need a guy like tim kennedy. You need someone who's actually been there. Yeah, yeah, no doubt. It's, it's an interesting time and the nature of war is. I don't think we're obviously with posttraumatic stress being such an epidemic that it is now. We're not adequately dealing with, with that element of things. I mean, it's an incredibly traumatic aspect of we're not prepared for death can come at any moment unseen, you know, like our bodies. Yeah, it makes sense. All right. There's the barbarian hoard. They're gonna run with their pointy thing and I'm going to have time to run at them with my pointy thing and that's when death might come, you know, but does not gonna come from this random explosion that happens. You know, every car could be a bomb. All of this.

Speaker 2:          01:56:09       It's this crazy time that we're in and we have to really pay attention to what that's doing to the humans and use the best technology available to to fix that. And I think obviously rick doblin has been on here a few times, is on the forefront of that, but we're just looking at the whole thing completely wrong. You know, we have old ideas, bad ideas, bad leaders, and it's again, that thing where truth is there. We undersTand that there's this epidemic. We understand, here's some possible ways to fix it, but it hasn't percolated all the way through. So we're in this transition period. That's, you know, it's, it's ugly right now and a lot of ways, but you can see the, you can see the horizon, you see that sun poking through the clouds and you know that truth just has a different resonance. It has a different frequency and it's adopted eventually.

Speaker 2:          01:56:52       You know, it's, it's only, you know, there'll be people who still think there's flat earth and whatever. There'll be some resistance to be some resistance. But for most of us, it has that frequency in that resonance where it's going to eventually win. And that's what gives me a lot of confidence. I'm just kidding. I'm eddie said he doesn't believe he does post a lot of pictures of the whole video the other day about some dude who's arguing against the flat earth and, or for the flat earth in the weirdest way possible. But it's what I was talking about before that I don't know if I articulated it so well, is that when you look at our culture and look at society and then you think back to the time of xerxes and all the crazy shit that was going on thousand years ago or 2000 years ago.

Speaker 2:          01:57:37       That's not that long ago, man. No, it's not. It seems like it is. It seems like it is. But like when, uh, I was listening to a dan carlin's hardcore history and he was talking about world war world war one. And he does this amazing. Um, I think it's a five part series on world war one and it sinks in like jesus christ. I was 100 years ago. like that's nothing that is fucking, nothing like that is so recent and the world is so different now than 100 years ago in 100 years before that. So different. And then, you know, he does. He had this piece on the mongols a thousand years ago. Well, not much different, you know, it's like, I mean, not much different in terms of the relationship between then and now. It's, it's so, so recent. So recent. Yeah. A thousand years is nothing in the scope of the world.

Speaker 2:          01:58:26       Right. you know, and then you take it back it out to, you know, some graham hancock's theories that he puts out magicians which are seemingly make a lot of sense that we'd reached heightened states before and gotten kind of wiped out and restarted. How many times did that happen? Well, how many times did we restart? Hit the reset button. One hundred percent with randall carlson's evidence with the two of them together. They really sort of both provided the missing pieces that each other need. And if you've never heard those podcasts, there's some of my all time favorite podcasts, the randall carlson ones and the graham hancock ones and the one time that I had the two of them on together, which is just a fucking epic meeting of the minds. The world is most likely experienced some cataclysmic disasters, most likely due to asteroidal impacts and it was most likely the cause of the end of the ice age.

Speaker 2:          01:59:13       And also the collapse of civilization was available then and the rebirth of what we're seeing now as ancient history. So when we look back at things six, 7,000 years ago, we think, wow, this is the dawn of civilization, not so fast. This is the dawn of this current era of civilization before we get hit again. And that is entirely possible and it's the crest of this wave. Maybe they got, maybe they got hit in the 19 twenties level of technology or something like that, you know, but, but. And they didn't reach 2016 level, which is probably most likely. I think we've probably advanced the farthest that we've gone in the wave. But who knows how far they got, maybe it was 1850 where they're shooting fucking revolvers and fucking whores and saloons and whatever. Or maybe it was some amalgamation, surely was different. It's going to be.

Speaker 2:          02:00:04       They'd had some things that may be better and other things that we're still kind of silly and. Yeah, but it's really interesting to explore that and give yourself some perspective on. Yeah, they have some sort of a parallel development in terms of their achievement, but in a different way. Like Egypt to this day we, we can't build those fucking buildings the way they did it. And people could say, oh, we certainly could 2 million, 500,000 stones that way, between two and 80 tons. If you put 10 of those a day in place, it would take you 600 plus years to make the great pyramid of giza. That's how fucking crazy that building is. So if you say, we could build that today, good luck, bitch. Need more faith in the unions. Yeah, well if you get it done, if you're off by literally like a quarter of a centimeter with each block, you're fucked by the time you get to the top.

Speaker 2:          02:00:56       Yeah. Think of that like if you're lopsided one way or the other, by the time you get to the top you're fucking doomed. This an interesting theories about how they did it, but none of them really sink in. All we definitely know is it took an incredible level of sophistication and it was done. The most recent it could have happened was 2,500 bc, which is just nuts, nuts. They're so smart and it's not just Egypt. You're going to go to Peru. I think I've shared that photo of me and one tombow the same one that crazy sucralose shared as well. You go there and you look the way the stones fit together and look at how the things are carved out and it just make any sense the size of the stones, like what did you do? How'd you do this? God, I would give so much to see the construction of the pyramids.

Speaker 2:          02:01:48       If there was like one time in history, if you could take that sort of a time capsule and go back and watch. For me, it would be ancient Egypt for me for sure. I would want to see how those crazy fuckers walking around with their wacky goth makeup on and weird golden robes and making those hieroglyphs and god what a fascinating, weird blip or weird era in the. The development of the human mind and of culture. If you think of what they were capable of doing and what they did accomplish over. Who knows how many. You know, we're. We're sort of going back trying to piece it all together. But one of the things that graham hancock and even more importantly, John Anthony West, John Anthony West has a new series. Apparently a magical Egypt too. I haven't seen it yet, but magical Egypt one is just fucking mind blowing when he goes into great detail about the different construction methods from the old kingdom to the new kingdom and that he points out that this is most likely evidence of a different era of construction and not.

Speaker 2:          02:02:53       Not as not just a different era, but different by 10,000 years maybe, and that the hieroglyphs on the inside of some of the pyramids which dictate or rather which, um, um, go over and depict the various pharaohs throughout the different stages of Egypt. Think go back 30,000 years. But what modern egyptologists choose to do is to say, well, all those guys that was all fiction. Yeah, like back when anything more than 6,000 years ago. Just fiction. Like, okay, so that's who bitch says, oh, you know, how do you know like this is, it's crazy enough that they did this 4,000, 500 years ago. That's just crazy enough. Okay. But it's no more crazy to think that they were doing it 30,000 years before that. Like this whole thing is this majestic sort of monument to human innovation in a, in a weird way that's not like what we do now with cement and steel and glass and asphalt roadways and fiber optic cables.

Speaker 2:          02:04:00       No, they had some other thing going on and I think graham mixed up kind of a cool point. Like they were building something specifically for permanence. Yeah. Like why, why did they want it to extend through time? Because all of our shit, you know, another ice age hits and you know, that the ice moves in and starts grinding everything and basically grind most of what we have to dust anyways, you know, but they were creating these big stone blocks, these things that were harder, you know, that would withstand the test of time and why. And that's, that's kind of an interesting speculative part of graham's theory, but what seems concrete is that

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       there was these cultures advanced and decided to do it now why gets into the speculation but go back tappy in gunung padang and Indonesia and then Egypt and all of these places really, really super interesting and interesting to imagine, you know, if, if the flood did kill off most of that civilization and they kinda just settled in different places and the accounts. Just one of the best books I think ever written was that magicians and just going into the mindset of, you know, he talks about they call these people watchers and then some of the watchers when I would get a bad reputation because they like sleeping with local girls and so they would be like the bad watchers than the good watch. Well maybe they were just. The pimps have their time, you know, they, they were eating more proteins that are a little bigger, you know, they have their little smarter as of course the girls liked them, you know, like why you got to hate on the watches.

Speaker 1:          02:05:27       Well, when they burned the library of alexandria, man, did they do the human race a massive disservice we could have learned so much could learn so much about why the ancient greeks would go to Egypt to learn shit and to engage in psychedelic rituals. It's funny that the greatest minds of their time would go specifically to Egypt to engage in these psychedelic rituals and to learn from the egyptians. The greatest minds of our time today will mock psychedelics. It's kinda, it's kinda fascinating. There's so few in terms of like mainstream recognized scholars will even entertain the possibility that there could be some beneficial aspects to engaging in ritualistic hallucinogenics well, all of academia is about defending to the death, your own structure of information and psychedelics are inherently disruptive and I think people have that knowledge. They know like, shit, I may totally rethink all my whole theories and you have to confront those demons that you're hiding that that which is hidden will come to the surface and that's generally the beauty of this process, but if you're defending something, you know and you're attached to it and it's part of your identity and because it's part of your identity, it feels real.

Speaker 1:          02:06:38       Like that's the trick that the ego plays. Ego says, my identity is me and I will defend it as if it was my flesh and blood. You know, like all of these things, my theories, my position in academia, it becomes real to the ego and so it fights as if it's defending your own blood and bone body, but it's not. It's just, it's bullshit. It's your identity. It doesn't matter shift, it's fluid. It's, it's, it's a manufacturing of that, of, of that ego, that attachment, and so psychedelics are threat to that. If you've been defending something that you don't want to get challenged, it could threaten your position of authority and power and people are afraid to do it. There's no real other reason to have that fear widespread. Yeah. There's a time and a place and it's not for everybody, etc. But you know really it's such a powerful tool to access truth and you can't be afraid of truth. It's just a silly positioned to be. Yeah. There's a really interesting documentary that's a

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       funny enough, a narrated by charlton heston about the mystery of the sphinx. I think it was on nbc at the time, but one of the weirder moments in it where was when robert schoch, the geologist from boston university and John Anthony West presented this evidence that the sphinx most likely was far older than 2,500 bc because of the erosion in the sphinx compound that could only be attributed to water. I've heard arguments against it. I'm against it being water and it being wind and sand, but they just, they don't fly. It seems like they're. They're working to try to make that a wind and sand erosion. Whereas it's pretty obvious the fishers, the way it's cut into the. I mean it makes total sense that it was water, but the only thing that could make it water would be that it had to be before 9,000 bc because 9,000 or 7,000 bc, 9,000 years ago, one of those somewhere a lot longer than 2,500 bc and the argument when it was presented to this archeologist, he was laughing, mom, well, what culture was around 10,000 years ago, they could have done this.

Speaker 2:          02:08:44       What culture. Meanwhile now we have those cultures. Now we have real evidence of go beckley tappy, which is 12,000 years old. We have real evidence of all sorts of weird shit that they didn't know me and then now they're finding evidence of human beings in north America. Fourteen thousand years ago, they're finding a woolly mammoth bones with a clear indications that they were slaughtered by human beings like cuts on the bones and then like, oh jesus, like people we don't know. We just don't know. We don't know what the fuck happened between 10,000 years ago when the ice age ended and today there's just so much weirdness and we definitely don't know what the fuck happened before that. Before that there is a lot of unfilled pieces in that puzzle. Yeah. It's, it's like it's really as the greatest mystery of all, you know, like the greatest mystery novel that I've ever read was graham hancock's book uncovering something that was real and trying to piece together the puzzle and in 20 years from fingerprints to magicians, all the new evidence that have come really supported his initial evidence, which was pretty good and fingerprints.

Speaker 2:          02:09:56       But then by magicians it's fucking whelming. You know, he was just so openly mocked by a lot of people that didn't want him to be right or didn't want anyone to achieve any sort of notoriety by having some sort of an innovative idea. I mean, they just, they, they pushed back on him so hard, but the stuff that randall carlson presents, like these various cradle craters that they've uncovered all throughout the world that indicate asteroidal impacts as recently as 5,000 years ago and deep into 12,000, 10,000 the, the nuclear glass they found all throughout and europe

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       that indicates massive meteor impacts somewhere in the neighborhood of 11, 12,000 years ago. Yeah, I mean it's all. It all makes sense at all for files or fills in like, well, what could have said, oh, well that caused it. Oh, that fucked a lot of shit up for sure. I mean if you look at that nuclear glass, that's the same kind of shit that they find when they do nuclear tests and they find it all throughout europe, all throughout asia, which indicates that they literally got bombed on by the.

Speaker 1:          02:11:03       Yeah, the circumstantial evidence. It's just mounting and mounting and it's interesting. You know, we hear about these things that are like myths and one of the ones that I saw that I'm not sure if it's true or not, but it's an interesting take on what actually happened to the cities of sodom and gomorrah because in the bible, you know, god rained fire upon, it, turned all these homosexuals and sodomists and people that sounded like they're having a great party and you know, what they were suggesting is that it was a media that burned up in the, in the atmosphere, and it raised, it created this flashpoint effect, which they know can happen and created this flashpoint effect where instantly the ground temperature reached several hundred or thousand degrees or whatever. So it was like this instant, everybody's just fucking crispy, you know? And how do you explain that other than an angry god doesn't make sense, you know, you have no idea. So these stories and myths get passed down and they're like, well, why did that happen? Well, I don't know man. I went to sodom and there's some crazy shit going on. But fucking so after the fact, you make up these stories. Man, I've of course, yeah, that's why it happened. It was just an unlucky party town. What was. It was hard to do. I mean that was, that was hard to explain. Then.

Speaker 3:          02:12:15       So people went to that, but today, I mean this guy in orlando, obviously he's fucking crazy, right? But he's killing gay people because he thinks the gay people are doing something against god's will. They're doing something bad and evil. So like in his mind like his wrath is like the wrath of god on these people with in 2016 with the information that we have with all the evidence that we have, there are still people that are inclined to go towards some sort of a, of a biblical or in his case, the koran version of, of the reality in which we live in like this. This is today when you're talking about 7,000, 8,000 years ago, I got only knows what it would've been. It was probably straight out of game of thrones, like the reaction that people had to any sort of a natural disaster. It had to be the will of the gods. It had to definitely be something that our own actions had caused and so when someone would stand up, like I'm the old dirty dude on game of thrones was once everybody to repent. High sector high sparrow. Yeah. That when that type of person would stand up and tell the people of this is because you have

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       angered god and it will come again. If you keep doing that and god forbid, god forbid, strange use of words, but another meteor shower. I mean meteor showers. Oftentimes they come like one after another after another and then he says this and then it happens again. He's right. I told you god is angry, you know, and then that gets passed on projections and it is. This is a really strange time and what I found interesting is I think that christianity will never go away and our cath catholicism and these major religions, but they will evolve. Like if you look at the trend, you know, back in the middle ages, they were doing crazy thing torturing people. I went to a dungeon in the inquisition. All of this crazy shit that was in Italy who were going, I'm going to Italy this summer. It was fucking horrifying. It was in one of the mountain towns.

Speaker 1:          02:14:21       I don't know exactly when, but there's several of them there and all the different torture devices that they have. So many of which by the way, involve the genitals. Like I would say at least 40 percent involved, different things, different ways towards falls and dick and pussy and tits and all this. I mean, it's just these ways that they could channel their own perversions into this unarguable point about, you know, this is god, this is what god wants, but they're really just pure status. Accessing that sadistic demonic energy and, and doing it under god's name. You know, and that's what happens when you create these systems that only a select few can access the knowledge. You know, nobody else can talk to god, these few people that did it and we're talking and we're the descendants of those people. We guard the knowledge. You can't reach it.

Speaker 1:          02:15:07       So it creates, instead of decentralizing in it and opening up truth to everybody, it's a select few that have it. Only a few people know god's will, not everybody can find it. And that's creates these massive power and balances. Whereas any good religion is going to completely decentralized and say, you know, not listened to me. I'll tell you what god says is, here's how you go talk to god yourself. Here's how you reliably go find your own deepest truth. You don't need me. And it's the same with any good teacher, any good healer, you know, like the very base level is, uh, is a teacher healer who, who fixes, you know, you come to him and he fixes, you know, and then the next level is someone who teaches you how to fix yourself. Like that's the, that's a master, but give a man a fish.

Speaker 1:          02:15:49       Yeah, exactly. You can. Yeah. And then the final level is just to really the great mystics. And even if you go back to jesus and you go back to the really great mystics, their message truly is that, you know, you don't need us to fix it. You're already whole like just recognize that you're already whole. You're already perfect, you know you are. You are the son of man. You are god. I mean that was really the core message that's got twisted in a million different ways and manipulated for power. Those was one of the other more interesting podcasts from dan carlin was on martin luther and lutheranism lutheran, lutheran, lutheran, this discipline and that he was the first one to translate

Speaker 3:          02:16:31       the bible from latin into german and translate it in the phonetic way that the people could actually understand what the word of god was and not have to be a priest because they were relying upon these priests and not only that, he was also the first one to say that your interpretation of what god meant is essentially up to you, which was just a blast for me to these people that had massive amounts of control. I think if you're looking for that one, I think it's called the prophets of doom or the prophet of doom. I think that's the name of the podcast from carlin on on that insane time, but it's amazing. Amazing to think that, you know, in that sense you're talking about like what was it, the $1,400 or something like that there. That's not that long ago at all. That's nothing and people couldn't read the bible. I mean think about that. They were relying upon these. I mean they weren't even pedophiles back then. They were allowed to fuck, which is really interesting. Like that pedophile thing. They. That only happened once. They wouldn't let the priest fuck and they wouldn't let the priest because the priests were fucking too many people because the priests were the rock stars. The priests were the celebrities totally

Speaker 1:          02:17:43       to power. They're terrible. Always create, get you pussy.

Speaker 3:          02:17:46       They were getting mad pussy so someone came along and said, all right, you fuckers no sex. They just made that up along the way. I mean, it wasn't even like it came from god and it's like it came a lot with. They had already established one way of behavior. Like even the pope pope's used to have wives. They had armies like pope's weren't like this weird fiba old guy who sits on a golden throne and it has little gay people do. Cirque du solei dances in front of him like that last asshole, but not the most recent pope is like kind of humble pope is humble hope the cool pope. Yeah, but it's, it's, it's, it's evolved and changed throughout the year, but just, you know, 600 years ago or whatever it was you, or 500 years ago, you couldn't even fucking read that shit.

Speaker 1:          02:18:32       Yeah. Yeah. Again, it's the control of power, the control of information rather than a shamonic way, which is always show you not tell you. You go to a two, then that's another great way if you're trying to find out who you should go with, like if someone's busy, blabbing their mouth and trying to tell you all of the things that you'll see from an iowaska journey or something like that, tell you all the lessons and give them to you that way. If I can go the other way, you know, like the true, the true path is, you know, here you go. I'm going to create the environment and you're going to go find truth for yourself. You're going to find whatever the truth that is and they have faith that you'll arrive at the truth that's going to be most beneficial for you and most often than not, it comes back congruence with those ideas and that's that's the true path. That's the path that any religion should take, and I think one of the reasons why buddhism is so popular because it's similar in that way. It teaches a practice or zen teaches a practice that allows single person to access that higher state of consciousness. Everybody can reach nirvana. It's not just the chosen, preselected, this thing, here's how you do it and go for it. And I think any good, any good spirituality system is going to have that in common.

Speaker 3:          02:19:41       Isn't it interesting though that that's sort of the exception to the rule to find a system or finding an individual like a martin luther or like someone who steps up and says, no, the whole world should benefit. All the people should learn this. Everyone should get. It shouldn't be about centralized power, shouldn't be about controlling the people, like that's a rare thing and that's fought against like vehemently like it's the, the, the, they passionately resist this and in many ways it's like what we were talking about before, like it kinda takes almost negativity and evil to bring out the best in people in a response. And it almost, it sort of takes this horrible control, this dictatorship of religion and ideology to resist in such a powerful way that you change everything around you because of these people were just sort of, well, you know, this is the word of god, you know, and go with it.

Speaker 3:          02:20:36       Don't go with it. Don't give a fuck. Everything's cool. You know, oh, you don't have to give me any of your money and I'm not trying to fuck her at anybody. I'm just hanging out over here. Would probably be no resistance to that religion and there would be no sort of rebound effect where people are trying to find their own truth and understanding that the negative attachments that they have to all these religious cults or sex or whatever you want to call them, the negative attachments that we have them are completely unnecessary. Like they don't have to be there. That through what everyone's trying to find through religion. You're trying to find the word of god trying to find ultimate love and wisdom and power and this one individual who has created literally the entire universe or this force has created literally. So why is it this guy's trying to fuck my wife and why is that?

Speaker 3:          02:21:26       I have to give everybody my goal that how come I can't read the bible myself? How do I have to trust this guy was trying to fuck my wife and steal my goats? I have to trust that asshole. Fuck that man. Yeah, and so then as martin luther guy comes along who actually can read it and understand it and translates it and there is a massive blow back and obviously just based in Thailand, dan carlin's podcasts, but apparently his influential position in the community was the only thing that kept him alive like anybody else doing the exact same thing he was doing would have been killed by the church. The church would have killed people for distributing the word of god in a way that other people could understand and it hadn't been done before. Like people had questioned the church before. They just fucking strung them up and cut the dick off and shoved it in their mouth and lit them on fire and launched them in a catapult. They didn't give a fuck back then. Barbaric.

Speaker 1:          02:22:18       Yeah. And it's in the. How does. So how does that, how does, how does a system like that take hold and take fact and you know, we, you've talked about the kind of the toxoplasma that alters behavior, this disease that will alter human behavior or altered mice behavior and we have that disease too and it's called fear and it's, it is the primary disease that once fear takes a hold of us, once we fear that if, if we do something wrong, will be punished in the most obscene ways, you know, look at like a bosch painting from, from Italy during the time of all of these inventions of how you were going to be tortured if you went against the will of god and you'll be punished not only for a little while, but eternally eternal torture and suffering. Like that's some kind of just punishment for, you know, having lustful thoughts or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:23:07       But that's what they believe. So they inject people with this fear of virus and then the fear virus robs them of their own freewill, robs them of their ability to think. So it's like this form of virus that takes a hold of somebody. And then you allow these atrocities to take hold because fear is within you, and in other cases, maybe it's the greed virus or some other thing that takes hold, but it's really like this thing that really limits your ability to use rational thought into, you know, to harness your own power of choice. But fear is that original, original virus that the religions played so, so well, you know, fear and guilt. It's weird because it's such a distortion of a really important aspect of being alive. Like you have to have fear of consequences. You have to have fear of animals and you have to fear of the ocean.

Speaker 1:          02:23:54       You have to have you. You have to have a healthy respect for the consequences of stepping off of a cliff or the consequences of walking into a bear den with a mom and her cubs. All those things are real. You know? And so you have to have fear. But there's some fear that people have that exists for no reason. Well, the, the idea that he's a good god fearing man, god, god fearing god is fucking love. It's like the most perfect form of love and truth, not when the skies on fire because people are blood fucking right, so yeah, you see where this other perspective comes from, but you know to fear, love. It's this trans. It totally fucks the mind like it sets the mind upside down. Once the minds upside down, it looks at everything all funny. Yeah. Nothing makes sense. You've removed a cornerstone of logic.

Speaker 1:          02:24:44       Now you need to fear god. Oh fuck, fear god. Well then everything else is just twisted up and fucked up and you can't even use your rational mind. You can't find the way out because your whole. The whole paradigm has been turned on its head and twisted. Well, isn't it an interesting in that respect then that it seems that the more knowledge we gathered, more information we acquire, the less we have to be fearful of, the more we can say, oh, that's not an angry god, that's a meteor a, and then one day, oh well we'll figure out how to deflect those meteors. We don't have to worry about the ice age ending or, or rather a dinosaur killing chunk of iron and stone from

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       the sky slamming into the ocean and killing all of us because we see those fuckers coming. Now we just shoot a net at it and push it off into jupiter or some shit mean. This is all information that will slowly but surely eliminate the need for fear and I guess that's probably going to extend to the consequences of injury and death as well. I mean at one point in time they're going, things keep going the way they're going. I guarantee if they get to you within a certain amount of time, that probably going to be able to reanimate. Animate you. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it will certainly remove consequences eventually, but there's so much we can do right now. We surrender our power to use those fears all the time. How many times have you seen somebody shriek, you know, because the fucking cockroach was around in the room.

Speaker 2:          02:26:11       It's a cockroach. They're clean, they're cleaning up the garbage that's on the floor. They've never harmed anyone ever. And that little thing is going to cause you to scream and your heart to race and like you can actually choose, actively choose through, you know, exposure to that and working through that to get over that fear like we have these choices and I think you have to collapse your fear into actual danger so that fear and danger on the same level and you can go too far where you can remove too much fear so you're not actually afraid of danger. And you know, people do like grizzly man clearly did that, you know, when he was hanging camping with the grizzlies and should've had more fear for those fuckers, but he didn't. By the way, I'm getting werner herzog. Oh nice. Yeah, that's awesome. That'd be really cool.

Speaker 2:          02:26:54       Is going to come on. Beautiful. I'm excited. I don't give a fuck what he wants to talk about. We're talking about grizzly man cave of forgotten dreams. That too. I'll talk about that as well. That was amazing. I want to talk to them about that tom cruise movie where he played a bad guy as well. Time of jack reacher, but grizzly man. I also think we're dealing with, if you have never seen that documentary is one of my favorite unintentional comedies, you have to see it. It's about a guy who decided he was going to save the bears. The bears did not need fucking saving. They didn't want saving. They didn't need saving. They weren't interested in his saving and eventually the atum eventually they determined he was. Yeah, they've figured out the assessment. Yeah. Harris part bears are so amazing, man. Bringing it back to our camp as we bring this bitch home.

Speaker 2:          02:27:45       When, when we were up there, it was like, I felt like, um, since you're, since you've been practicing archery for a couple of years now and you've been really getting into it, that would have been the perfect first archery hunt because it's a controlled environment. It's, um, it's a, a really high likelihood of success. Even though we both struck out it's a high likelihood of success. And there's, um, there's, there's a crazy intimate connection that you have with an animal when you're up close with them within 20 plus yards and you shoot it with a bow and arrow. That is like some really

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       old dna that you tap into that some like there's a, there's like a switch that goes off where your tissue is like, oh, we've seen this before, this we did this 500 years ago. Like there's, there's genetics I think that are attached to archery and some sort of strange way. Apparently I have, I'm not a traditional archer, I haven't done that, but they say it's even stronger in that that shooting, even just shooting a regular bows like a recurve bow has an even more sort of a visceral connection to the human body and the human mind and you know, with ted nugent calls the spiritual flight of the out of the mystical flight of the arrow that there's some sort of a weird ancient calling. And when you, when you do that, when you. I wonder if a catapult to do that launch catapult on a motherfucker like, damn, this feels good. I think people progress that all the way to the, you know? Yeah. But I think the catapult wasn't used for hunting, for use, for war cattle. Jesus christ be a herd of elk. Boom. Then you go look for scraps.

Speaker 1:          02:29:38       Take you shoot a recurve all the time. I shoot a recurve all the time. I really enjoyed it. Super way less accurate so I wouldn't go hunting with it, but it's really accurate with them. No. Yeah. First, yeah, I guess. I guess for me it's way less accurate. I'm sure some people are really practice and they get really good at it, but there's so many weird things like judging distance, super weird site. Well lisa, yeah, shoot instinctive so there's no site so you're just feeling it. But you read a book, zen and the art of archery, eugene arrows book, great book and it. It applies to regular compound bow, but you really feel it when you have the recurve and. Yeah, and just a piece of wood and sinewy twisted and you're knocking the air and you're just going off instinct cause there's so much more variability. It's less, it's less, you know, mechanic. It feels like you're just more of like a flow type of thing and it's fun. It's fun to fun to do that. I always imagined that. It's like, yeah, like

Speaker 3:          02:30:33       a lot like playing pool in that you develop a feel for where it's gonna go. Yep, and you have to do it. So they say that it's one of the most important things about traditional archery, instinctive shooting is that you have to shoot hours every day to be really, really accurate, but like if you watch like olympic recurve shooters, they have a lot of weird shit going on, man. They have like a clicker so they'll pull the arrow back a certain distance and it click will go off because you could have the go all the way to when I'm making a motion like you could pull it back to your chin or you could pull it past your chin and it gets not like a compound bow or it hits a wall. Compound bows extremely accurate and guys like john who was a

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       guy who have set up my bow and he. He wrote the curriculum for the world archery federation, whatever the fuck it is, and travels all over the world to teach people proper technique and teach people and coach international teams and archery. He was saying that if you get like a rifle shooter and they shoot like freehand, not resting in something to 100 yards, that archers are actually regularly more accurate at a hundred yards with a bow and arrow than someone holding a rifle as well. Yeah, that's really wild. It's crazy. Yeah. I mean with the, with the traditional shooting though, compound bow shooting your. If you've got a 70 pound bow it's going to shoot 70 always. Yes. So that's, that's a variable. You don't have to factor any kind of recurve bow can shoot 20 pounds if you just pull it back a little bit to fucking 65, whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:32:15       Depending on how much you can actually bend the limbs of that. Yeah. And go. So the up and down variability, I mean side to side, you should get pretty accurate, you know, just by anchoring and kind of lining that up. But the up and down really depends on how far you pull and your breath and your release is not all. Your release gets super squirrely too because its fingers don't have a little release thing. So you hold on a little tight or you don't let the string flow through your fingers the right way. It's just shoots off all squarely. Yeah. So that's why the olympic recurve people, they have like clicker. So they pull their arrow back and once it gets to a certain length it sets off a little click. So it's like click and then they released the arrow so they know when to release it.

Speaker 2:          02:32:58       They know when they've pulled it back far enough to get that click. Yeah. It doesn't make sense. But you know, it's uh, I, I gotta think you'll lose a little some of that. Yeah, magic. You're starting to move at all, all the way towards the compound, but at a certain point might as well just shoot the compound if you take all of the, the feel of that thing out. Yeah, I wouldn't. If you look at a compound bow, if you look at someone who's shooting a compound bow like people, I put a picture of me up, uh, from our camp that ben took when we were there. And one of the things that people have commented on, like look at that fucking weird thing, like always pulleys and cables and all these things hanging off of it and the site and the stabilizer. There's so much going on.

Speaker 2:          02:33:41       In your case, it's to the max as much shit going on on any boat is ever, ever been on a boat. Yeah. I tried everything. I tried everything. I mean I've whittled it down, have added things and taking things down. But oh, there it is. There's the photo. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot going on and I fucking that thing. But all those cables and pulleys and you know, the stabilizer and the adjustable site that goes up and down depending on distance, but it's so fucking accurate. Yeah. But so fun too, man. It's like there's very few things I enjoy as far as clearing my mind as much as just shooting at a target. Yeah. Well it demands president. This demands that you're in the moment you're thinking about other shit, you know, because everything is so finite. Same with pool. I think gravitate naturally to these activities that to be good demands full attention and inattention is bliss.

Speaker 2:          02:34:36       Is happiness in intention because that's the present moment. You will. It definitely removes all of the outside distractions that really aren't. They're not important right now. Like right now, you're breathing. You have food in your belly, you're alive, you're healthy. What is important? Well, you have a bone in your hand. What's important as you make that arrow hit that x, so shoot it stupid. Stop thinking about some girl you fucked when you were 18, right? While you thinking about a car that you sold when you were 22, man, if I had that car today, I could fix it up and like, what are all these extraneous silly thoughts? What are these traumas that these animals don't carry? Like you ever heard of a bear with erectile dysfunction. Maybe never. Maybe maybe this gay bears maybe, but they can still get it hard and viagara I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:35:24       All of these things that we have in our that our monkeys are just broken because we've ceased to recognize the monkey and all of us. You know, so getting back to that and looking at nature is just a great way to do it. Whether you're hunting or camping or whatever. Just fucking soak that in. You'll learn shit. There's also a feeling that you get when you're in the woods where there's. There's no cell phone reception, there's no people. You don't hear anything. You're just surrounded by trees and wildlife in some weird way. It's for some people, they find it lonely. They find it like, god, I hate this place. Doesn't give a fuck about me because it doesn't because you realize that you really are a part of this enormous, almost infinite system, infinite and the terms. If you go down to the macro level or the micro level, you're, you're, you're down to adams and you're down to subatomic particles and then you expand from there to cells and cell walls and the structure of tissue in the body and then the instincts that come with keeping the body alive and then with a human being language and then the culture and media that you have absorbed that has given you this distorted idea of what life is, what being a human is, what being a man is that music should play.

Speaker 2:          02:36:43       When you see your girlfriend, you know, you know what I mean like this, like they. There should be a a score to your life and that you are enormously important because your ego wants you to survive long enough to shoot your loads into someone and make little baby arby's and this. All these things. They don't. They don't matter. When you're in those woods, all those things, it's like the woods confront you with this ultimate reality that you are a part of this infinite system and this infinite system. When you really expand upon it, the, the very itself, the very planet, this planet and all planets themselves become tiny little subatomic particles in the nature of the universe.

Speaker 1:          02:37:23       Yeah. Yeah. That's the perspective is so key and it can be kind of mind boggling to think about it. I'd like to, you know, it's almost like we're, we're lords of our own universe in our universities. Our body, our thoughts can manifest different things. Our choices create the environment that we live in. So you know, it's like we have our own universe and then we're plugged into this, you know, greater universe that is, that we know all around us, the planet and everything else and that's plugged into the larger and you start just expanding your perspective and it just kind of really goes on infinitely. You know, like the cell is as part of an organ is in there. That's it's universal liver cell, the university, the liver cells, the liver in there, one cell in that thing. It goes up and down infinitely and you just get a, get a perspective that, you know, everything's gonna be okay no matter what.

Speaker 1:          02:38:12       Like everybody, just fucking relax, enjoy yourself, get back in touch with the monkey, get back in touch with love and whatever happens, it's gonna, be all right, there'll be another earth, there'll be another time, there'll be another opportunity for this thing to go. We get so caught up in the minutia of the details of this thing or that thing. It'll be okay if the earth blinks out, you know, some other point in some other time in the vastness of eternity, another fucking awesome earth will come with new, awesome animals and it'll be okay. Everything will be okay.

Speaker 2:          02:38:43       You heard avi gentlemen, everything gonna be okay and with that good night, ladies and gentlemen, much love buddy. I'll remark is on social media. If you want to follow me, I love you guys on a dotcom pitches. Go there and get optimized. Holla.

Speaker 5:          02:38:59       Oh.
