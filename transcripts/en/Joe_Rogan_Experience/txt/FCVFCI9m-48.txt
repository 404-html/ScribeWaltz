Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. We live cool. Beautiful. We don't need no fucking stinking music. We don't need it, man. We've got us. We've got us. Yeah. We were just discussing referee's letting guys get choked unconscious. It's only Egypt. Educate that dude from this previous weekend. Yeah. We, I think I'm some guys who never been choked out. I think that's one thing. Even if you, uh, you don't, uh, have a martial arts background, you can be in referee. You're aware of that, right? You can be, yes, you can be a referee. All you have to do is understand what's going on. You take like referee classes and you'll learn. You can start out taking referee classes as a complete total novice. I think you should have, I think as a ref you should have at least been choked out once and been knocked out once. I mean, Herb Dean had a profile.

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       I think he had several profiles, couple and herb dean roles all the time. Herb deans, a real martial artist, Mario Yamasaki black belt. So it was John McCarthy. He's a black belt in Jujitsu. All those guys that we fee just so his, um, uh, Josh who's in jail right now. Gotcha. Gotcha. I'm pretty sure he's out. Josh has very high level brown belt. He knows his shit. If you're a vendor stripe white belt, you know what the Hell's going on? A little bit. A little bit. Especially on a rear naked choke. I don't think it was a Doris or something of a hit and you can't see, well he was face up to, it was a real naked face up. So it wasn't like, you know, it like sometimes guys get choked out and the guys on top of them and they have their back and they got a belly down and you can't see the guy's face.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       But when the guy's face up and you're looking at his eyes, Jesus had, what are you doing? Yeah, he was out for a couple seconds. You know, sometimes people just don't make good decisions, you know, they just, they error. It's not that they're bad people, it's just the earth. It doesn't work. And in that case, look, if I fuck up, it's not good because a bunch of people are listening and they want the show to be smooth and they're attaining. But if I fuck up, it's not that big a deal. No one's getting hurt. Right. If this guy fucks up, someone's going to get choked asleep, you know, that wouldn't get choked asleep or someone's going to get beaten a few extra times, which can make a huge difference. Then the beatings for sure. I mean the good thing it was in a joint manipulation submission because then you're talking about someone's arm being broken so they're just getting choked out.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       Well in that situation, no, don't you let the guy fight out of it. Like I let a guy fight out of a full arm bar. Cause the way I would feel is that if his arm pops that's on him and guys have gotten their arms popped in one fights for Jon Jones got his fucking arm popped against v true. If you watched it, yes. Did fuck yeah, he got his arm completely hyperextended yeah. By then the trans whole body. Dude, it was bad. This is probably a of, well if we play the video of the podium, there's, there might be a picture of it. You find that an image of it, but at full extension it was completely hyper extended the other way and John's elbows fucked up for a long time after that because I remember he had the, uh, coach, the ultimate fighter and like that's one of the things they said like, well this is good anyway because you can't really train right now because his elbows fucked up from the Vituro fight.

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       So he will you in tab one of the closest he's been to losing. Huh? Pretty. Besides the decision was that was Alexander, but it's definitely the closest. Yes, probably he's been in for sure. For sure. That was a bad, bad, bad, bad spot vi towards nasty dude. You know, a lot of people are taking him for granted versus Weidman because the whole TRT thing, I don't fucking buy it, man. I don't buy it looks good and it's pictures. It looks way better than he used to. Like there was a period after he got off TRT where he deflated when we saw him at those Wayne's, he looked like a straight welter weight, but it looks, he looks a lot thicker now. It looks way better. So I know he's been doing a lot of, uh, they say that the way you have to jumpstart your system, one of the big ways you do a lot of compound exercises like cleans and presses, forces your body to produce less testosterone and estrogen.

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       Testosterone. Yeah. Big, big things like he was doing searcher squats, which is where you know you like, it's almost like you do a, you put your hands together like you're in, make your arms, like you're curling, you put the Bar, you hang it from your arms and you do your squats. Like that tough man on your core. Yes. Yeah, yeah, I do too. So he's doing all that kind of crazy shit. So, you know, I'm, I'm hoping this is how it, uh, how he, this is one idea how strong Jones is. He's just so weird. Strong. He's ridiculous. He's draw but veto or caught it at a perfect spot. You know, he might've, he might've been able to win the fight if he didn't let up on it, but I think he let up on it when it a popsicle and he said he let up on it and I believe him.

Speaker 1:          00:04:29       And then he got some instinctive. Yep. He got come Morad John Kamora him. I mean after his arm got all fucked up. So his right arm was all blown out and he still uses it to a Kimora him later on in the fight and then he's fucked up for a while after that fight. That was one of the reasons why he a coast, the ultimate fighter right there. Well, Chelsea had jail so he just wasn't training. Like he'd walk by him and Shelby training twice a day I'll follow squat and John and walked by Christmas clean. Just nice and showered and like, what is he training? Maybe he wasn't. It wasn't, he wasn't. Yeah, just chill. Said that's when he realized that he's just not as good as John. He's asking. He said he got in there, he said 30 seconds in. He goes, I want him to come out of that ring so fast because I just couldn't believe how strong he was.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       Jon Jones Jones a Goddamn joke. Now think about him and then think about what Anthony Rumble Johnson versus him is going to be like, like that's going to be the most chaotic God damn fights. I that's not my number one fight all time. All time. Yup. Dang. That really has thank God. Why? Because he's got such a knockout power and time makes a mistake and I'm, because I've been thinking about it, I've been thinking about all the great matchups like there's been some great match ups, you know for sure like um, like Bj Penn versus George Saint Pierre when it first happened. God Damn, that was a big build up, big match Tito chocolate delvers deal. But those, I had a pretty good sense of what was going to happen. I had a pretty good sense cause they trained, ESPN was too big. I think GSP is too big. It was too hot.

Speaker 1:          00:05:55       His wrestling was too good. And I knew the beach. I just didn't, that was before the Marinovich has, he didn't have that work ethic that he has for a very short period of time when Bj was in just insane shape, like the Sean sherk fight, he was in the same shape that was actually before that. But he was in insane shape for that fight to Diego Sanchez fight. He was a destroyer. Kenny Florian. Yeah. Um, who else? There was a couple of other fights that he had one who was in like the best shape ever as a lightweight, you know, but when he bought a George, I was like, George is just too big. This is just not the right file. So this is for you. This is the biggest one to me. This is the one where I don't know what the fuck. First of all, I think John is the greatest light heavyweight champ of all time ever.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       Right. I agree. And I think he's also still growing and getting better. That's what's scary. Spectacular talent. Cause he, he just moved his entire camp to Albuquerque because he used to live in New York. Now. He bought a place in Albuquerque and he's training full time now. Yeah. He was just going to Albuquerque for camps. Huh? Y'all crazy. That's going to be crushing me. Comes after a beats Anthony Rumble Johnson cane. That's what he's got to go. Right. That's the question is if it's not after, because I don't know what the fuck is going to happen when Anthony Rumble Johnson puts myths on you. I don't know. I don't know who's going to be able to withstand that. I don't see the problem is is John is so much longer and the reach is a factor. So I listen, I thought Glover was going to be an issue for unboxing.

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       Offered nothing because of that length. It's tough to deal with. Man. Clover is very good. I said Glover is like at a, at a possible like standup challengers. When I was looking him coming in against John, I was like, he's got like really heavy hands, especially really experienced, especially at the time. Well he took a step back. He's not training with, uh, he wasn't training with Hackleman for this last fight. He did it all in Connecticut. A lot of yeah. And his own, he had his own camp that he did down there and a lot of people thought maybe he wasn't prepared as when he fought John Though there was a ton of hype in the UFC pitch. I'm like, this is the guy chocolate l signed off on it. Dana White, you know, everyone I felt, again, I felt like it, I mean I felt, I feel like guys are as good as they are in their best performances.

Speaker 1:          00:08:01       Right. So like if you look at him like his best performance, like he gets clipped by Ryan Bader in seconds later, he puts Bader away. Yeah. You know, you look at the way he, uh, beat up Kyle Kingsbury. That was a scary guy. Damn fight. The Kyle Kingsbury fight was scary. He just came out and he shows you what the fuck he can do. What you're like, whoa. And you know, the Kyle Kingsbury who's a very good athlete and a really cool guy, wasn't at the best of the best. He wasn't at that level. You know, he was dominated by, um, um, uh, Pat Cummings had come into play recently. Recently. Yeah. So it's, you know, there's levels and then, you know, Rumble Johnson as bad times at one 70. But you got to think that a lot of that had to do with him starving himself. Sure. And when you're looking at him as a light heavyweight, you know, the way he fucking destroyed Nogueira I was just like Jesus and then taken out Gustafson like that in the first round.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       Well that although I wonder, because he did Headbutt Gusta Synagis and fell to his knees. Roof slate looks like you're wonder at that point. Cause I, I mean Gustin is still killer and I don't, I don't know, we just didn't get a chance to really see it, you know? Yeah, definitely a factor. But she'll be effective for both men. Right? I mean they're hitting each other with their head, but I feel like every time John has a, a new opponent, it's like, oh, this is it. This is the one looking at DC. I thought D I legitimately thought DC was probably going to beat them in a decision three to two. That's, I thought he had the perfect setup, the perfect pedigree to beat Jon Jones. And then, I mean, John Destroy Him, took him up by the hips. It really wasn't, that really wasn't that close of a fight.

Speaker 1:          00:09:27       So then now it's like, oh, here's Anthony Johnson who, and I love Anthony, he's a monster. But I feel like we go through this every time until, until he fights cane. I think once he, once he does and that's going to happen. I bet when he fights cane now we're talking well, I think Kane has to stay healthy, you know? I mean that's one of the, I think he beats Cain. He wow. He might. I do. You never know man. Look, he looked, he might very well beat Johnson. It might be very well, one of those things, you look back on it in hindsight and you said, well, you know, maybe I should have, you know, figured that this could have happened or that John would have an advantage here. But Dude, when I watched that too late mid Sandhya people always tell hardest hitter at two oh five by Shane happen when that guy's hitting you.

Speaker 1:          00:10:09       That's, I don't think that Anthony Rome, that Jon Jones is here on a peep out of him wrestling wise though. I think Jon Jones will dominate. I mean if he grabs him, hold on him, he seems to just shut the fuck up. Did you see him fight Phil Davis? Yeah, Phil. He the sprawls. He hit Phil Davis with ferocious spa. Did you see what he does with different Time Olympian? Phil Davis is a very high level restaurant close to it. Not not like Dan Courtenay, Dan [inaudible] Olympian and that's true. Sure. But Jones literally, I couldn't believe he picked him up by the hips. Boom, dumped him, dumped him again just out wrestled them and and me. I said, this guy is so much bigger than you think when he's hanging on you, whether it's leverage or whatever. And Daniel Cormier is a guy who picks up heavy weights and throws them on their head like a, what's his name?

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       Josh Barnett. No doubt. I don't know if you guys look call me. It wasn't a good matchup for him. John figured it out right away that he could take them down once he took him down the first round. So was like, oh yeah, once that happened that you're like holy shit. Yeah that's a, that's a damn wake up all anybody who was it, who knew a lot about wrestling said is there's no question that Jones is going to be on his back when Courtenay grabs him. See what you know what, when you got a guy who's super fucking talented and his big derailment is a family. I mean that's what happened. He had a kid and then he, we got out of competitive wrestling cause he had to feed his family. But if he had gone on the wheat, what I'm seeing out of this guy, like wrestling with people, but he would've been, he was a dare go national champ.

Speaker 1:          00:11:37       Juco, national champions. Not punk man. And no, not at all. What does Juco actually college, the junior college national champion. But I think like he would have given feet. People fits as a, as a wrestler. I mean, anybody in the world who would have given them fit, I think it would have all been dedicated or like how much, how much time you dedicated to it and how much energy he did. But if he was in a situation where he could train 100% of the enough to support his family, he would have been all I call seriously world class amateur wrestler, if not the best slush in his weight class. You look at what he's doing in the UFC, if he decided to focus on wrestling, you'd be the best. He's a fucking with this mentality, man. And then you know, you look at what Johnson has been able to do when he hits people.

Speaker 1:          00:12:15       Man, John doesn't do that. There's a difference between the way John Hits people. John, it fucks people up. Make no mistake, John. Spot tougher guys though. Fuck yeah. Hundred percent. Yes, he's, John's fought everybody. John, John, John fights a little nog. It's not going to be pretty. No, it'd be ugly as fuck. Especially now. He'll be so confident coming into it now. But you know, if you fought them back when no Garrett gave, um, uh, like let's think about like his best performance in the octagon. Uh, Brill's Michael's Brill's shod. Rashad was a good one. Rashad was a good one because he shut him down with his boxing and Rashad was tentative like afraid to commit. Like people don't realize like no little nod was a like an actual champion in Brazil and it's like really couldn't box both of them killed as an amateur boxer. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       He medaled in like the Pan Am games or something like that. Now he's legit, super legit bus rumble at that stage, like rumbles coming up little nog or is good at an older in the dressing room while a little nog was warm up cause I was corn and Pat Cummings against the king's Bay. And uh, what was that? Sacramento, I think San Francisco. Anyways, um, little nog was warming up and he, I'm telling you man, I was like, oh no, someone should stop them from going out there. He could, he couldn't even hit the mitts. You can hit the Mitzi so stiff. He just sat back until Burt said his name and then he started going. A lot of those guys, by the time they get to a certain age, they've, their body's gone through so much trauma, like so much physical trauma, so much damage. Somebody kicks, somebody punches somebody take downs.

Speaker 1:          00:13:42       It was just Mike Rowe and they're not that aware. No. Him and his brother and not that old they had for Roche, especially his brother had for Rucius was brother that fight with Bob Sapp. Whoa. Oh my God. There's never the same. After that fight, his neck was always fine. If you watch that fight, it's hard to believe. He got through that. He got pile drive by 300 plus pound Gyri hundred 75 super athlete. They offered him the fight again. He was like, no, I beat him and he was like, it doesn't make sense to never fight together that big again. Break his back, man. He could have broken his back. Dude, he piled drived him. I mean, and just an all natural Bob Sapp just fresh off dude. You're going to get us written up. And my main magazines, again, this would be printing shop says Bob Sapp was on steroids. I should probably address this fader or thing cause people keep bringing it up because we, first of all, um, I think it's weird that we have to, every time we have a podcast and we just talk shit, it becomes like stories getting trouble. Yeah. It's Larry us their stories. And one of them was that I, that it was probably, it

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       was highly possible they'd fade or could have been on performance enhancing drugs. I'm not saying that because he was cheating and everybody else wasn't. And when I say that, I'm just saying it only based on the environment that that guy was competing in. Where do you look to the contract? It said specifically we do not test for steroids. Does that mean in anybody's on steroids? No, it absolutely doesn't mean it. But that doesn't mean the possibility is there. The positive, if it comes out and he says, I never took steroids. This is a fact. I have no reason to disbelieve him. But we look at the environment that that guy was competing in and there's no doubt about it. We're just brought up Bob Sapp. He's the major one. He's the number one major one where there's, there's the best evidence you ever need that no one's testing anybody.

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       Come on you gotta Guy hold is not even a human. Three 75 three 75 with ABS, 6% body fat or something like that. [inaudible] Jack Beat, Ernesto hoost outweigh one of the greatest kickboxers of all times. Uppercuts junkie in the armed. Him just smashing with muscle and just test and d ball. Whatever the fuck else was is fine. But it's like you look at, there was a lot of guys who were doing stuff back then. If you talk to the people that competed, even people that are clean, they'll tell you, man, I saw dudes that I know for a fact we're doing shit. I know a good percentage of went to it. It might not have been fader. It's not crazy to assume it's not crazy. It's not ridiculous to assume that second. So, first of all, the big important point, it wasn't even cheating. It's only cheating by our laws.

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       We're talking calling, cheating by United States laws. They didn't even have it in their contract. Like it's said in the contract. We're not going to test for stories. They're telling you. It's basically says, yeah. So it's like if the look, let's put it in perspective with this whole Tour de France thing, the big argument bill burr had a hilarious segment on Conan talking about it is like everybody was on juice that it's a dirty sport. The are psychopath beat your psychopaths, but you're out where everyone's cheating and he's right. He's right. That's the, that's what if everyone just admitted what they were doing, then we would just be able to deal with that in the fact that well to do that bike race, you need to have all this shit in your system. That's the only way these guys could do. We can tell kids that don't feel inadequate next to Mr this fuck guy.

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       He's got scientists cause this guy's got EPO in his veins and we should tell people this is the only way they can do this and compete, you know. But we make sure that their levels don't get above a safe amount and then you know you let them compete that way. There's a lot of people that feel like that. Like if you have like such a dirty sport. Whereas like when he had to give his, when Armstrong had to give a shit back and they should go back 15 that was like 15 plays. The guy who didn't test positive for something. So it's basically a level playing field level. They're all cheating. It's just who's better at hiding the cheating? Right. Who's got a better team behind them? I don't think that's necessarily the case with fighting. Like I've said, I would bet $1 million at Bj Penn never took shit.

Speaker 2:          00:17:34       I bet a million degree. He's the guy. A lot of other guys, I think if they got injured like this is Anderson's thing. He's saying that he took it because he was injured and he was trying to heal is like he still can't do it because it's illegal. Like you can't, it's like it's not in the rules because they, first of all, they've shown that if you do take it, I believe that you're only taking it to heal your leg. Don't get me wrong. But if you allow people that sort of loophole, there's certain stores that you can take that in, they alter your body permanently. Like you're going to take steroids that they've done tests on these and it might be a small amount and that small amount might be not even close to like the advantage that someone like has John, like John Jones has over someone like Eddie Brill.

Speaker 2:          00:18:14       You know what I mean? Like just insane genetics in Saimaa athleticism. Like even if you do take steroids and you keep a little bit of a bitch, still not as cheesy, actually stronger than you, like your Foxville with nothing, with no, with no drugs, he's way stronger than you, so you're fucked. But you just can't let that, he can't let that be something that everybody does because it's not because you'd have hit no cause you'd get into what you'd have to define what an injury is. Now suddenly people would all have injuries. Well not only that, people would do in the off season and put on crazy Strang and Americans will use some of it. Good. Hate the sport. If they knew it, everyone was cheating. Exactly. Related to the Gills. It's just not pure. People want assume they're, they're heroes and the guys they see on TV or gals or supplement free.

Speaker 2:          00:18:59       Yeah. And if we got to a point where everyone is like doing like it's all, obviously they do it. What do you like? It's listed in their stats. You know, he takes 15 milliliters of this fucking Tamil goal. I oxy Maca fate and he tells like the whole stack that he's on and it's all about getting the right stack. Let me in a really nice, I'm really important for it take. But it raises a very important question, which is as we are pushing way beyond our biology and it's becoming exponential and so you're going to have high school kids, like Ray Kurzweil says, who can inject themselves with tiny little robots that that that like the red blood cells that basically oxygenate your blood, they can sprint for an hour. Oh, but Brian told me the other day that technology to create a bulletproof flying drag. I was just saying there's a saying synthetic biology, they probably all fun.

Speaker 2:          00:19:46       But I mean we're probably a hundred years away from them being able to create organisms. Craig venter says 25 years, but the point is just smarter than me, so I'll go with that guy. The point is that you're getting to a point where you can, where, where biology and technology is is just getting to it. How do you deny it? You're going to gene doping, do all this stuff. So then what, what does that mean when you're competing against another guy? Is it actually like race cars? Race cars have a whole team of mechanics, but work on that, Angela, it's like race cars. You have a very specific amount of cubic inches you're allowed to have. That's true. Everything is a limit to where they run into. So it's all of the skill of the driver. Huh? Like the sophistication of the team that puts it together. I mean they have their justice suspension, calibrate the dampers, make sure that everything's correct as far as the weight balance and all this other jazz.

Speaker 2:          00:20:36       And they build a solid engine. But the engine has to be like, you know, whatever it is, 500 horsepower, you'd have to have a, you can't. And here's a little news flash. If every girl in the division at one 35 took steroids, they're still not beating Rhonda. You could be juice to the gills and you're not beating Rhonda, you guys at two oh five juice all you want. You're not beating John Jones. He's just not going to happen now. Right? Isn't that strange? This is like there's guys that, and by the way, that might've been fade or it's very possible, but when I say this, I say this, I have like a few all time favorite fighters. Brendan Schaub of course, cause he's my friend. Um, you didn't, you never saw me do taekwondo. All right. I Dunno. National Video. I guess we'll get to the but, but the, the top two, like there's maybe like three or four like that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:24       They're interchangeable and one of them's Vandelay just cause every fight was chaos. I would job be a Vandelay Silva Fan to the day I die. You Aco was a maniac in pride when he fought rampage and he's standing in front of them, like bobbing his head back and forth. A fucking leave time, do this fucking thing. The gloves do. I can very clearly remember Eddie Bravo and I sitting in my living room, cross legged on the couch, hands sweaty. When Vandelay was about to fight rampage, it was a couple of balls. Investors. God Damn, he was good. God Damn, he was chaotic. He was just, he was just so ferocious. So he'll always have a special place in my heart. But then when it comes to technicians, there's two guys that are interchangeable. It's Anderson and fader. Those are my two favorite techniques. Anderson fell out of my top because of the steroids.

Speaker 2:          00:22:14       I give him a break. You give them a break. I give him a break on his past performances. I give him a break on the spectacular knockouts like the Vitor Belfort front kick to the face choking out Dan Henderson. When Dan was dropping bombs out, people, I give him a give him a break, you know, before it's Chin went before the, the Weidman fight. When Weidman caught him, Weidman fucking hurt him too. He hurt him bad and if you watched that second fight, it just does not look like he takes his same punch that he did in the first fight. And during the clinch she gets clipped and he goes down and I looked at him, I go, man, here's a guy is struggling. Like this is the end of the car. Like he's 39 yeah, this is what, this is how we look at athletes. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:22:53       There's the reality of if you're going to be natural, it is the reality of athletes. They get to a certain point, especially after a few knockouts and they're 39 years old. Like that's what you're looking at man. You're looking at the, the deterioration of the master. And at one point in time Anderson was the fucking master to say anything else the best. He's the best as far as everybody, as far as performances. I look at the way he put guys away too, like the Stephan Bonner fight. Like Jesus fucking Christ. He did it like he's a magician. He, he's standing with his back up against the wake him over, waved him over and then when he decides it's time to attack, crushes him with one knee. Flexis confidence. You have to have to do that. Huge to Donna's six for 10 35 was on juice. Water tested.

Speaker 2:          00:23:36       Positive. Positive. Yeah. I mean obviously the bond is not the best example. I mean, he's the best fighter that uh, Andrew, no disrespect, but he's not the best fire that Anderson's face. But you at what he did to rich Franklin, rich Franklin said, tough motherfucker, man. Look at rich Franklin with chocolate dot. How about Forrest Griffin? Right? But do you think the rich Franklin that fought chuck Liddell was better than the rich Franklin fight? Anderson? Cause I don't know. There's no, no. So the Anderson that fought rich Franklin, he fought the best rich Franklin ever and just ran through, stood in front of them, dropped his hands and let him throw kicks Adam and just died a fucking championship fight in a world championship fight. His hands are down, the guy's throwing kicks in his head and he's bobbing and weaving like it's not even happening.

Speaker 2:          00:24:15       So you got the Anderson over Fado I go out to Anderson overall. I have annual number one always. He's your favorite. He's my number one Anderson's. My favorite has to be. He's one. Who's your favorite? Well, this is just my, my opinion, this is my opinion and in that mix, in that mix of, of those great guys is Anderson and in Fader I say Anderson overall, but I had some fantastic enjoyment watching fade or fights. What I'm saying and what I said about it being possible that someone might've done performance enhancing drugs. It's not an accusation. I'm just highlighting the reality of the environment that they were competing it. That's it. As far as my respect for him as an athlete and as a fighter, I'm a huge, huge fan of that guy. I've always been a huge fan. There's a video of me on youtube with that huge UFC hated because I was talking about what a bad motherfucker he is.

Speaker 2:          00:25:03       This is what he's fighting for the other organization. It's a highlight video of me just ranting about what a bad motherfucker he is like I've always thought he was amazing. Everyone's top. I have to be honest. I'm honest about everything and even if it's, if it could be possibly perceived to be disrespectful, it's not my intention. My intention is to look at the reality. I don't know whether or not someone took a performance enhancing drug. I don't know. I have no idea. I could take a wild guess, but it's all bullshit unless I see it or unless we know for sure because someone tested positive traps are ridiculously large as well. Even then build as soon that though it's not crazy. No one should write a story, but you exactly, exactly. It's like assuming I'm the only one that tans in him on his shit.

Speaker 2:          00:25:45       You guys are white. It's not ridiculous to assume I tan. You Know Dimitri? Yeah, Dimitris Ukrainian. Yep. And he's built like a brick fucking shit. This dude and I had been friends 15 we competed together. We were in the same taekwondo team. We try. He was the heavyweight. I spotted that dude. All I know. Brian, you're on the same circuit. I didn't, I couldn't actually, I'm what I like missed a national tournament ones cause he kicked my Shin and snapped my fucking not the Tibia. The fit, which is the fibular that Timmy. Timmy is the fat one. The fibula, the painful ones. He's up. My point is, is a stone that mother fucker never did anything. I know he never did anything. We're friends, we're friends back when he's competing. I mean they didn't test anybody back then. Like they tested you if you've got to the Olympics and taekwondo would know if he was on some though.

Speaker 2:          00:26:29       He wasn't on Shit. I know he wasn't on Shit. Juicy. Can't do that and I wish the public could, could meet certain athletes where it's like, no, these people are actually born different than you. You meet Tim Tebow, you see Tim and it's just like he, he, he won't take protein powder is worried about Ronda Rousey. You hangout with Rhonda? No, she does nothing. And she's just built different than us. He's just a freak. Brock was at the UFC this weekend and I shook his hands and he picked me up in the air with a handshake. What do you mean I'm not bullshitting? Dude picked me up in the air with a fucking handshake. I go, what's up big man. I clapped hands with him and all of a sudden, C'mon Dude, I'm not fucking around. He's a monster. I mean, he kind of touched me with his left hand while he picked me up.

Speaker 2:          00:27:17       That was just him. Sack of potato industry. Giant has giant his, my hand disappeared. It was like a laptop. It was like, oh, shaking hands. A little shame. Carlin who picked me up and started to squeeze me. You were there and I was like, oh, it's happening. He, that's, I just hear him night year, that's 20% bro to Shay's squeeze my body and Shane, we'd be on his boat, his hands so big. We'd be on his boat and I'd be like, Hey Shane and the other berries, like I got one brother appeals handbag. I like, Damn Bro, can't fuck with doc kind of genetics. You can't fuck with that kind of genetics are just too big and I wish people could hang around with athletes of this caliber gets like, no, I'm telling you, they're just built different. No matter what you ever do, you're never going to be on the sanctuary gain equal Mike Tyson in his prime.

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       You mean just get the fuck outta here. He didn't even do shit and all he was doing with working out who's getting up. I run at five 30 in the morning because it's dark. I don't know what the film that my opponent feel sleeping and that gives me extra strength. I feel confident and just fucking running just to just fucking diesel. Diesel's square headed, destroying machine, credible, fast twitch, muscle fiber, an anchor, and finally in his life he's become special after years of neglect and that special talent is knocking. Motherfuckers out was a hundred mil in the bank. And can you imagine him in his heyday he had 400 million at one point then loss at all. Why don't think y'all had it all at one point? No, we had 400 million, but I think that's like it's total that he pissed away over his life. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:54       Yeah. Hey, how he had tigers. Charlie Murphy was on my podcast and told the story about Mike Tyson. Fucking tiger. Just a video of it. Pull the video of it. Somebody made a video. Find out who the video is made by. Some fan did it. He did an animation of Mike Tyson in his fucking tiger got tight. Charlie Murphy pulls up and no one wants to get out of the limousine. They're all sitting there. Tyson's house. This is when his brother Eddie Murphy was fucking gigantic. You know, he's still is. But when Charlie and people didn't know Charlie was, Charlie was hanging out with his brother, who? His friends, I'm not close. They're pretty close. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're clothes. I ran to them just totally randomly in Maui. It was the coolest shit out both of them. Yeah. I was at the, I was at the counter checking into a hotel and uh, his cousin rich was there. I was like, what's up bridge? What are you doing man? Cause we went on that together, the Maxim conduct,

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       right? He goes, Oh shit man, what's up? You just Charlie's here. Eddie's here. I go, no way. So I went and hung out with Charlie and I had, I sat down with Eddie Murphy. I was like sitting down with Eddie Murphy having lunch. Cool Dude. Funny, Nice Guy, man. He's so nice because Charlie's a standup guy, right? It's Charlie is a fucking prince of a human being. Really. He's a gem. I love that. That's good to hear. He's such a good dude. Like I had, I hung out with that dude. We did 22 shows together and I liked him more every night. He's as just a solid stand up dude. Charlie Murphy is from those to New York. Charlie Murphy, a legit martial artists too. Oh really? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. He's legit black belt in karate. Yeah. Yeah. He fought in like, well his dad was a [inaudible] shit back in the day.

Speaker 3:          00:30:26       But he's well immersed in martial arts. Like you talked to them about martial arts and he just recently got pretty popular. Right? Cause, well not recently, but because the Dave Chappelle show was on there, but that's where then it's like, oh cool. Charlie Murphy or I think, I think his dad was a boxer and Eddie Murphy Works Out Bay. That's he boxes, you know, I don't know if he's, yeah, but his dad was like, no, I don't think it was a pro, but I think his dad was pretty close. Well, I don't know, but I know that Charlie has been doing martial arts since he was young. We had some great conversations about it, but just about everything, man. He's just, uh, he's just one of those dudes that you listen to him like you want to hear him talk. He has great stories. Could there be anyone bigger than Eddie Murphy at the time in his Hay Day? Eddie Murphy was so big. Yeah, that donkey on, what is the Israel trek? I think he made the movie made rag the voice of terrorist. No, he's the Shrek and he's a donkey. The donkey where you live in Saudi Arabia when all this shit was going on. I know who he is but no ma'am. No, hold on.

Speaker 3:          00:31:29       The donkey is where he made a ton to me. $13 90 hit the brakes real quick. One of Eddie Murphy, standup comedy specials raw, which I saw live. You saw like you were in the audience. I know that's a minor tickets. My friend bought him for us. It was a surprise for her brother's birthday and it was incredible. Greg Belasco and his sister Amy and we went there and I had, I was so I was probably, what, 1819 when it comes out in his leather suit. Oh my God. And I, these are seminal moments cause you could see them on the screen too and his acting and the things he did was shocking. How good. He was shocking and they were all going crazy and he went to one side of the room and he put his hand. It was here. Then the next is here and I was like, well that's the coolest dude on the planet.

Speaker 3:          00:32:18       The idea that I do that I lot in a small way that I'm a comic is still incredible to me. Washers highlighted his career's not trek being the donkey. You didn't let me finish what I'm saying. They were talking about how much he made for university. Definitely fucked up right man. Guys won. You won with Shrek guys. You don't think he fucked up guys. Hold on. I'm sure he made a lot of money but guess what? It was already rich as fuck kitty Murphy come on site for a while though. Did listen dude, settle down. What is dry spell? What are you sitting back counting how much money he had. He got done. He probably counted about a thousand dollars a day and he got bored after a while and then he said, oh, let me start doing movies again. And he did that movie with Steve Martin. Everybody goes, Oh shit, I forgot Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest guys ever.

Speaker 3:          00:33:03       Ever. Brian's like the donkey and what'd you say, Jamie? Yeah, doctor Doolittle. No, the dogs are like little kids' movies. I got to go back to like trading places and could know like 48 hours, eight hours, 48 hours is the big Beverly hills cop. Three nicknames come on. Him and Nick Nolte said, Shrek man, you didn't let me finish [inaudible] him. I was saying, he said he effortless. He made some insane amount of money just being a donkey and was telling you kind of 13 million. He didn't need it. I know it went in a pile somewhere. Right. He doesn't even feel that. Have you seen this girl? No. Have you seen his girls domestic? I'm over on the planet. Sure. He was still beautiful. I saw him at the beach or like, it looks great. He doesn't look like whatever old he is. He's older than he is. Great. But I look older than him. He is also a Germaphobe. He, he'll use a bar soap once thrown away. Rich. That's our sneakers. Charlie get sneakers. W they're in a box before a show puts him on, throws those bitches to that. I'm rich. I'm gonna wear socks. One son, I don't wear socks. Was the video of Charlie at Mike Tyson's house cause this is how fucking Goddamn Funny Charlie Murphy goes. I bet he has such good stories.

Speaker 4:          00:34:19       Jason, that Tyson document, is it just called Tyson? You see a man, it is fucking incredible when he reflects on parts of his leg. Strong man like that. You got to realize that whatever was on it was no joke. Yeah, it's incredible. That's a man. One time I went to his house and it was five or six limos and nobody would get out the limo and I said, how come nobody's getting out the car? They said you don't see it. Lane standing behind tasteless lane, his front yard like hang over starts. The only man who's house I haven't went over. There was a lane in the front yard. He was on the steps. They district heavyweight belt [inaudible] Kit Kat. That's fucking real tasting in the lane. A male or female. The main, the lane in his front yard. Loose Shit.

Speaker 4:          00:35:22       He was at the end of the yard. Oh my God. They came out and started wrestling with him. Jog. Damn. He ran. So how big was the lion? It was big man. It was grabbing him and started tussling them and all this stuff and everybody was in the limits to the land. Could come up to the limousine and buster window open and come in here. Oh sorry. Easy. He can just go out and get a booth and come and everybody was in a car. You couldn't back out cause it was all like five limos. It's everybody's in the car. Her fat thinking it makes me get me to be eaten. He plays with them and he'd put, takes him in the back. I back out and that was like, you know what, I'm never going to be around another man in life. That's going to do that. I'm saying

Speaker 1:          00:36:11       that's incredible. Who is the animation? Telepath slane at telepathic void. That's the the line back in Lima Sla. I N at, what is it again? That's the way. Ah, ah, shit that she could just say, just say booth. I just want to give these guys credit. What does, what does it, what did it say at the very end there? Just want to give the guy, cause it's really cool. It's funny. Animation to telepath void. So slain at telepathic void. Yep. Okay. Thanks buddy. Thanks for making that. But I've never, I never heard anybody use that expression. Elian heavyweight belt. Every windmill as the first time. I'd never seen something like this again in my life. Imagined seeing him sitting there with a heavyweight belt. Imagine of the experiences Mike Tyson hand in his hay day and Eddie Murphy and his heyday. God. Yeah. Excess in Santa Damn. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       That kind of celebrity brings out the aphrodisiac. Damn. Oops. There's so many crazy fucking dudes in this world that have competed in MMA so many crazy worlds that have fought so many crazy dudes that have fought. And boxing there. Their whole life stories. If you had to like accumulate the wildness of like a Roberto Duran Tappia you're seeing the Johnny watched the documentary on Johnny tap. Really meet a loca drug addict fight world champion, Aaron Pryor, same things. Pillow. So many of these great fighters. Just crazy, wild lives. So much nuts, chaos and ending sometimes like Arturo got to getting shot and killed. Kill it. No, he got strangled. It's fucking girl. His girl killed them. Send them out off in Brazil. It was all in Brazil. Set them up for the insurance. Right. She apparently he was hit on the head and choked. Yeah, and they're saying he did it to himself.

Speaker 1:          00:38:00       Come on. Yeah, it's his family thinks she fucking killed. Yeah, they got a picture of her getting out of jail. She's laughing and smiling like that's not how you may feel. That's if you, if that is really your husband, you miss him and he's gone. You, first of all, you feel horrible that someone put you in jail for that. When you miss him so much and killed himself and second of home, when you come out, you don't, you're not smiling. You're like a celebration for this. In his celebration, you're still depressed because your husband is dead because he killed himself and you were just accused of doing it and people still suspect you have it. You should be depressed. You should feel terrible. She felt at the whole world is calling bullshit on you and saying that you killed him. You should be like, you should be under pressure.

Speaker 1:          00:38:40       I says liquid. She's under pressure at all. I saw statistic today that said in Mexico, if you commit a murder, there's less than 5% chance that you'll do any jail time. Oh, it did. That's awesome. Because of how insane is that? The people doing the murder are a lot of times so well connected and you're talking about cartel violence now the cops are involved and everyone. So I keep my ass and yeah. You know what, man, I have a real, real terrible feeling about the way our, our worlds connected. We'd like these borders of countries and we won't let people in and we keep people out like on in some sense, I kind of understand what people are trying to do, trying to manage what we can with our own space. But if you're not managing your fucking next door neighbor, if you're not helping, you know, like say if you live next to a crazy broken down trailer and there's some fuck and you can't move, this is like you're, you have a permanent permanent house.

Speaker 1:          00:39:34       Yeah. This is your neighbor, man. What are you gonna do? You're gonna help Matt. You know, his kids need some food. Maybe it needs a little money for gas. Like, yeah, you're doing a lot better than him. Just give him a little every now and then just to sued this motherfucker's life. This Mexico's issue is not that Mexico's the issue though is institutions and the integrity of those institutions. Professor Cowen add it again. It's really true though. Okay. But I was, I was making a point. You fuck no, but what I was trying to say is these people, we should, they shouldn't be like another country. They're right there. They should be people that we consider, you know, to be in a bad situation and try to help them, whether it's help him politically help him financially, but the idea that we're just, we're separate from them.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       Like there's, this should be like a lot of emphasis on trying to fix Mexico and a less emphasis on fucking with countries that are on the other side of the planet. Well, you want to fix him. You legalize marijuana overall in the United States because the cartel drug wars, what's feeding all this chaos? That's part of it. That's a big part of it for sure. You know, and there's a big part of it is probably going to be like a lot of the corruption that you're saying like Pr. Probably a lot of that's going to go away when things become more and more transparent because of the Internet is going to be harder and harder for people to pull off the kind of shit they're doing. Her Russia right now where you see Putin's number one enemy got just got whacked level shot right in public with his girlfriend.

Speaker 1:          00:40:55       So someone just came up here. Good. He's so much homeboys 55 and he's got this smoking Russian girlfriend. She's 23 he's been with her for three years. Well hello honey. He's walking down the students totally love. They're very compatible. He's walking down the street with her and fucking car pulls up but just unloads on him. Kills her two or nothing. No, didn't shoot her. I think more than one guy shot her, shot him rather he was the head and she's just standing there. Why they just shoot him in front of her like bang, Bang, Bang. It's horrifying. It's dead and you know, and now they just left her, let her leave and go back to their country and they allowed her to think she cried or she's like, Damn. She probably was freaked out. I mean, that's a terrible thing to say. It's probably completely freaked out.

Speaker 1:          00:41:44       I mean, as you imagine, you're dating this dude and he gets assassinated because it's probably loved them. He was a really charismatic, awesome guy from, you know, he was all about reforms. He was a big critic of the, I'm sure that's why she was with them. Well, back then. You know, who knows what. It's cultural. Everybody's got a different way of looking at things. Please question girlfriend, what are you doing Jimmy? She is ready. That's what I'm saying. That's crazy. He's, I've ever seen hit red hot murdered Putin critic. That's the murdered Putin critic. Magic. Imagine if that's like your title after you're dead, you're the murdered Putin critic because that's all people are going to remember about that cat when we'll on CNN stuff on American. When I was doing the ice bucket challenge, I did it out there. You're benching 315 pounds, right?

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       You did the ice bucket challenge while benching count. Pour the water on me and the only thing I was concerned with is I said if it slips like it cut, falls off and hits me in the neck and I die. Will it be on CNN will be like, guy tries ice bucket challenge dies. That's the only thing I was worried about. I'm going to die from 315 pounds. I want to track and drop it on Monday to totally drop it. Like your arm's going to stop working well with the water. Let's say it slips off yet. Have you seen that the USC football player, it's not going to be good either way. That guy was benching some stupid amount of weight, like 600 plus pounds, right? Wasn't he? No. This dude, the homeboy had I think maybe 400 300 something and it slipped because the way they would do it, they went wrap their fingers around the bar.

Speaker 1:          00:43:09       They're just like this. Oh and his arms failed and it fell. It just slipped off. No, and he dives off the bar. No, he was, uh, he's supposed to be a pretty high draft pick. Fell on him off season. I really can't do anything. And it was just like Jack the McMahon. Freddy can't talk anymore. Broke, broke his neck, trachea, everything. Can't speak. Fuck. I've started different one. I saw it. It was a white guy. It was a power lifter dude. Well, I've seen that. He was so fat. I think he's good. You know, there's an advantage to be in that thick. Well, a lot of guys get punched in the belly when they're fat and the punch and everyone reaches them. I mean, they've got fucking five inches of layer. It's crazy. Like if somebody punches you legitimately Sony, like you could fuck somebody up at one of those taekwondo body protectors on, you know, I've seen people get kicked and go to the hospital, to the body.

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       But if you're a fat guy, you've got to, you're walking around through life with a Jak one body, you ain't, and Roy Nelson was a liver shot. Roy's going laugh. You hit him to the body. Especially to this, the front of the body. Yeah. You. No one is ever going to the front roundhouse kicked that dude in the stomach and really fuck. He's the biggest mystery fights over him next. That's a good fight. So that's in Dallas. Dallas. That's going. It's a big card. That's a good car. What are you doing that weekend? You're around what?

Fuck he's married and having family and all that shit now. But if he wanted to, yeah, he could. But my point being is that this guy like create a character and was doing it on the radio and then that character became super successful and that's just like who people think of him as.

Speaker 1:          00:48:24       Well, it's just like nobody gets along with their jeans. You just like, see, just for that reason, not fair to him to play this whole material. So let's just cut it right there at the point. Nobody wants a scene. Anybody's material from 1987 I, it's still doing comedy today. When you started at like two years in and you're on some terrible TV about when he's having a bad day and just has to play a redneck dogs, a kite. Rip The fucking snaps off. Gimme this Mollison that dude's having fun. He's having before this happened. You don't really get sick of playing a redneck. No, because he's, he's farming. He's, he's a character. It's a really funny character. Super Funny. And he's, he's got good jokes. He's always writing new stuff for it. I can't believe he's selling out in Nebraska stadium. He makes over $20 million a year. Easy.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       Yeah. He's a Jack for sure. He's gigantic just doing standup and he, you know, he's his own boss. He does whatever he wants. The goal now is to get a line in my front yard that's, and you won't go in and on. I do go halvsies on w apex. I'll have it. I'll have it Monday through Friday. You get it Saturday, Sunday you go around, the kids got kidnapped. Cat's going to have some fucking problems. It's gonna feel weird and not know where it's real houses the guy in the New York City and have to dens. It's true now the dude in New York City who had a tiger in his apartment, he had a crocodile too. Did he? Yeah. Alligators and shit. Meeting it wholesale. What did you think was going to happen? We'll go with a best case scenario with this giant alligator in your town.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       You might want to plan, you might want to plan for it. You got to call the cops. He had to cough carves, man. Blood to tiger. Fucked him up. The tire scratched him. Yeah. Tiger was like, bitch, I'm out. I'm living in a fucking apartment. I need some exercise. It was being a tiger. Yeah, you can't have a tiger and you got damn apartment in Harlem is one bedroom studio. Yeah, the line. The Tiger freaked out sun. You could fucking run. See some like crazy dude who like thinks he's neo in the matrix and he's got some long coat on and he doesn't want anybody to know. He's got like extra bolts in his door and he'd go inside and he's got a menagerie of fucking animals. They're tigers and lions and shit and it's apartment. I told you I got a tag in my house.

Speaker 1:          00:50:25       He's like, his mother fucker really has a tiger department. His dark cloud over his head is constantly, I when nobody knows. But I, when I have the best pet, I have the strongest pet. I don't even know that he's the fucking neighborhood mystery. You know, nobody wants to be, he has, he has zero friends. If you have an alligator in your bathtub and your best friend's a tiger, a pet tiger, you have zero k. But let me look at it from his point of view. What would you rather have an alarm system that you know no one's gonna give a fuck cause the cops are never going to answer it anyway. Like you're, they kicking your door, your alarm goes off, whatever the fuck your dad is. Fuck. Okay. If someone's going to try to harm you and you're in the Harlem, they're going to the cops.

Speaker 1:          00:51:02       You got to stand outside until the dust settles and then move in and they're not there for crime prevention through. They're there to write tickets and shit. Okay, so would you want an alarm system that everybody knows is bullshit or a fucking tiger in your house? I'm going to say, oh, how confident are you with a pistol? You can walk out with a stereo while you're holding off a tiger bitch, bro. It's on Q was trained. It's like, all right, someone's breaking. I better at this tiger out that tigers fucking the robber up and you, no one's getting out alive. Well would probably once it realizes how fun it is to fuck the robber off, it'll just want to fuck you up to man. It'd be like, wow, if this motherfucker to crack open a can a handle for me. They just decide fuck him up right now.

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       I want you stupid chicken base and they just decide what they want to kill things. That's what we ignore them. We put them in zoos. The most tortuous aspect of zoos. It's like taking a man in his prime when he's just unbelievably attracted to women. Right. And then putting him in like a glass zoo and closure and parading naked women around him back and forth. And some people say that that's not, that's an unfair example, but it's not because nature has reward systems and the cans are the cleanup crew. When you get a limp and you fucked your design didn't work. Well guess what? People would thicker anchors. They survive. Yeah, but thicker ankle people survive. You thin ankles. Motherfuckers gotta go, okay, can't go fishing. I heard fucking Samoan babies that can run fast. I mean that's what's going to survive. Tigers are everywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       And the San Diego Zoo, there was a Jaguar and the woman who tends to the cats was there and I said that if I walked in that cage with that thing a attack me and she said it would kill you. And I said, you didn't seem to hesitate. She goes, nope, it's a Predator will kill you. And I said, what are the chances you think of a human fighting or something like that. But she goes, well, she said what it would do is it would bite you and it would keep adjusting its grip because it's, it's canines, whatever you call them, have nerves where they can sense when the juggler is. So just keep adjusting and then get on your juggler and you'd go to sleep. My boy, Cody Donald and worked at the, he was like in the morgue in the hospital where they put the bodies in and then at the Denver Zoo, the lady at night who would feed the Tigers and all that shit, she didn't lock the, she didn't lock it good enough.

Speaker 1:          00:53:13       Like she whatever through in the fucking t bones or whatever they give them and then she thought it would automatically locks and it didn't, something messed up the door from closing. So she's wheeling the car is five can jaguars sneaks out from behind the home and they said she died instantly cause it's big ass canine went all the way through or scroll through the back of her neck. Boom, got a coat wool Cody at to get the body and he said they had to look and it's just like this giant hole from, from the cat's canine straight through Jaguar too. I mean that's not even a particularly well or they're pretty big. They're a couple hundred pounds. Did I lie? No Jackson. Not huge though. Tiger. They're bigger than a leopards and they're very powerful. They think that that, yeah. Le Jaguars are way bigger than they are in South America too.

Speaker 1:          00:53:58       Yes, they're gonna creep. What you know about sleeping the most pound for pound. I believe a Jaguar is the most powerful cat. I think the multiple cat cow for pounds a house cat. I think they said have house cats were big. If they were big like a lion or tiger, we will be fuck yes. Are you serious? Yes. You never attain them. You never domesticate them. They they, they, they still have all the same traits as a jungle cat. They're just smaller. They're very powerful. Like when you see that, how far a house cat can leap for its body style. Well, if you've seen that video with the tiger that jumps like 12 feet in the air to get a piece of meat, there's a video of they're holding this meat like above this truck for this tiger. This tiger leaps through the air to get the meat.

Speaker 1:          00:54:35       We'll look at how high the wall was in San Francisco and the kids are shooting that tiger was miss rockets were throwing pine cones. That what? It was an entire, it was like, I'm going to, I'm going to, I thought that what they were shooting with risk rockets? No, they were throwing pine cones on it supposedly. Yeah. I mean it was a bit and from my act and he got had to get about it. Tiger getting out and look in the guy's face when the pause at the topic level. That's right. Like you can't and you don't know who you are. Daniel Day Lewis. I don't care who the fuck you are like you like I would have loved to seen that guy's face because no one can pretend that killed one guy fucked up. Another one guy. I think one guy, I don't know if the guy tried to help his friend or what happened, but the second guy got killed.

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       Not the first guy that got attacked and these were the guys throwing the punk thing jumped the fence. Apparently they can jump 14 feet, but this, this fence was only 12 feet and there was a big lawsuit because our suppo threatened to big lawsuits. I don't know if it was settled, but because they're fucking fence was too short. Man. The tiger just had never jumped before. He never gave him a shot for sure. So needs to map that out. Back my bit was if you got a monster in a box in the middle of the city, put a top to the box. Be like you went through all this trouble to build all this shit this way and you're like, is that high enough? Yeah, let's get out of here. Like at least someone, someone decided to 12 why don't put a fucking top on it?

Speaker 1:          00:55:53       You got to fake rocks. It's true. You got to fucking pooling their forum. How about a roof? Fuck heads so it could jump out. That's so ridiculous. That's the dumbest fucking thing ever. Zoos are laymen general though, man. What's the last name with the zoo? I went to San Diego Zoo. That line was pissing on everybody. Piss ant man. Walking back to a, as a zoo can get back. I don't like, that was the most exciting part by far. It's good for little kids. I like, I take my kids that makes sense. Like to look the animals, but it's depressing if you go bums, bums me out, man. Yeah, the press, especially the primates, it's very depressing. I was surprised at what, how poorly they actually eat. Especially the primates. They're not fed the kind of food and that it's very hard to feed them their natural diet, especially in certain ratios.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       I don't think they feed the chimps. Um, like the first of all to give them mostly like vegetables. Right? They don't allow, a lot of them developed diabetes in captivity because they, there's no real set standard for how to feed a chimp. Like as far as national zoo, you know, and what do they eat? All of those different, I read, I remember reading about, I was so shocked at how they fed these chimps. It was not good food. It was not, you know what they'd really like to eat, man, they really love to eat monkeys. That's right. A little monkeys too. It's hard to watch. You know, they didn't know it until the 1990s I think there was a guy, David Attenborough, is that who it was, did a a nature documentary in the Congo or some shit and they follow these chimps and they, they had this hunting party, they took down this monkey and they're ripping the monkey apart and eat and it'll lie.

Speaker 1:          00:57:23       We'll call this monkey the see the thing screaming, the look on his face. What's eating it? Like asked first chewing on this thing, pulling it apart. Like that part the monkeys screaming like, I can't believe it's getting even is one of the most fucked up disturbing videos I've ever seen. Even like I can't hand you see them looking up in the trees, you know the main one looking up in the trees and they're there, they're mapping where these monkeys are going and they cut off as a group. They want they, they, they cut them off, they funnel them, they be it trees and they'd get them to go in a certain direction and then they, they box them in west side story and then they just take it on pause for, they also found that monkey chimp, young male chimps will band together and go kill other chimps from other trucks.

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       Like your mother. Yeah, the league. And occasionally cannibalize. They'll cannibalize people from other George chimps. From other tribes. Yeah. Our ancestors are assholes, you know, and so are people on times they do a lot worse. Well of course, but I mean bipolar ape, we're not killing eating people though really? Well. We are, but so many are in lunch. But if you look at the numbers, see how many fucking chimps there are in the wild and they're doing this fucked up shit. The monkeys. And then look at how many people there are. If there was as many people or chimps, is that where people, it would be chaos. You wouldn't be able to leave your house if there's this many champions. There were people you would never be able to get to your car. They would mug you. They got, they would rip your fucking feed off and fuck your ass.

Speaker 1:          00:58:49       They'll do whatever they want to do, whatever they want to. I think that would be the one animal. Actually. You definitely don't want to have a counter. You May as well choose a crock because I'll kill you right away. A chimp will just take your face off and do the genitals off. Yeah, it was a less likely to attack you. Yeah, they're fake. You don't fake charge you and you have to stay in charge. I want you to get the fuck out of here. Just get the fuck out of you staring at me. You crazy ass chimps. Gonna rip your Dick and faith, but were so soft. We think it's okay to look at a wild animal in its eyes. That's so stupid. We are. Hi

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       Challenge. We're cool man. Well, from National Geographic Society, we just come to make sure your baby's okay. Fucking crazy. 800 pounds, silver backyard long through the trees, right in your face. He's got bangs and only eat vegetables, only designed to fuck you up and you couldn't even imagine what an 800 pound gorillas strength. It's like, because you would think of it as like an 800 pound man, but it would really be more like a 3000 pounds to twist your head off like this man. Like she'll repeat a pieces, probably more than 3000 probably like a 5,000 pounds or some ridiculous number. Look at the muscles on a 200 pound chimp man, when they, when they have one of those their hair. Aw troll looking fall, I'm beast stared at those muscles forever. If we had as many chips as there were people, everybody's always down for chimps and I, and I'm, I look, I'm not saying we should exterminate the chimps, don't get me wrong, but let's just be realistic.

Speaker 3:          01:00:16       If chimps were everywhere and they had full freedom, the way people do what, you got serious problems. Yes. Yeah. Well the first problem with so and said that was okay for those chimps to fucking hang out with us. And if you don't think chimps, we'll steal babies and eat them. You haven't been paying attention to the literature. That's Grad Center. I haven't been paid attention. They will still babies. Baboons will still be fun that Jones. I knew baboons are wild as fuck and evil. Evil country on your back. It's not a good idea. Baboons are creepy dog fucking monkey things. Nobody's got a pet bat. Boom. Now, some people do they? Yes, I did. He brought about nearly two in Africa. I know. There's like baboons with fucking masks. I'm terrified. I know. Every time. Last time I left his volcano, he's like, you're gonna die any minute.

Speaker 3:          01:01:05       Keep away from volcanoes. Don't run for office in Russia. It makes, makes you get that book because it will challenge you eventually. We keep the chip population to a minimum. Yeah. Everybody was down for chimps have chips Ahoy squirrels. You'd be fucked. Yeah, you won't be fucked of. Chimps were one and through the fucking muscles look good. This is my favorite. Look at that thing. Look at the muscles. Oh my God. They're so strong where there's a male where, look at that. Look at that and what's really, that's the same chimp I, yeah, but what's really fucked is later balls on it. He's got some balls and that's what they all look like. We just usually see them covered in hair and we don't realize it. That's right. It's got some thick wrists on that guy and those hands built for brutality is not built to pull your eyes out of their head with no Dick for she has a dick.

Speaker 3:          01:01:53       He's probably playing with it, man. He's probably holding it up with his extra long fingers. You're not putting them in a rear naked choke. We are not doing anything to him. Oh my God. He would laugh at you. Oh, look at that Gorilla and Oh my God, so big. Oh my God, it looks so big. Six foot 600 pounds. Again, not messing with a very big piece though. Oh no, they have tiny dicks. It's not a matter of fact. Does it? Difference in, notice how he says a tiny balls too. Here's what's interesting. Can you a little science? There's the dessert with primates. There's a direct relationship with the size of the testicles and the permissive ewas ness of the surrounding women. So the more the women are just fucking everything buck wild up in here, the more the dude's balls get big and that's it.

Speaker 3:          01:02:37       That existed cultures as well. For sure. I live in La and my best humans have the largest Dick's though of all the primates. Port per capita, you know, poor per size. Probably measure if you measure this pound for pound. Our dicks are the biggest cause we're the biggest hose. Yup. Not necessarily like us and Bonobos. Fuck a lot on. But our dicks are bigger. The thing about gorillas, dicks and balls is the grills are so fucking unchallengeable they could have a little tiny puds and they still get all the pussy does. No one call. There's no giant gorilla just stroking it, sitting by the side of the fucking pond. Eating bamboo shoots with a giant show. Lailey gorillas know like Lingham get over overflow. This one inch killer you've been fucking with cause it grills have one inch. Dick's. It's so disappointing. But if you look at it in a grills way, a big Dick is a big target.

Speaker 3:          01:03:33       You want me to dig bit by a snake might be the difference between survival and death. When you're out there living in the fucking jungle. Okay? You want a tiny Dick with a pee hole so small, the one of those little ball eaten fish can't swim up there and eat your ball sack out from the inside like they're known to do. I heard back in the day, like in the Roman times, uh, a big Dick. You were made fun of. It's like look down upon. Is that true? Same today. It's like the Internet. It's like the Internet. The Roman days were like Twitter. If you have a big Dick on Twitter here, but you fucking the blood goes. Do you become a retard proven the body can't support a dick. That big statues request to keep the penis small cause it took away from the body and how hard it was to chisel like that realistic body and foot and all that out of the marble.

Speaker 3:          01:04:17       So you kept that area [inaudible] story. I bet there's a bunch of dudes Jackin off on a statue of a giant cock took the cock and they were but fucking the statue in the middle of the square, like backing each other up on the statue of this giant. I just heard back in the day, if you had a big old Dick in the Roman times, like they made fun of you. Like you're an outcast. No, that's hilarious. I don't think it's fun. Make Fun boys. Go ahead. Oh, real funny fellas. Funny Man. Dick, did you imagine if that, that is the one that's the one group of humans that will never get sympathy if you mock them. Cause Dude's a big dicks. I know what, no matter what. I mean, just different races, different nationalities, different genders. There's all sorts of categories where you are, uh, you're, you're not allowed to mock people because that's a rude, even white people.

Speaker 3:          01:05:02       There's people get mad that you're mocking white people like, man much fuck, leave us white people alone. You know all the privilege that white people have, it's still not enough for you to be able to mock them. Take it for judge [inaudible]. Dude's a giant dicks. You got a green light. You could find something about that guy that you can make fun of. You can make fun of that dude. Nobody's going to back them up. We did know that he was going to come along and say, hey dude, with the female Dick, you know man, I feel your pain. It's a bullshit. They're mocking your giant super fucking Alpha Hog. That giant Dick at all. The women want that huge veiny monster of destruction that you're swinging your pants, your giant, your giant pool. The one thing that a dude cannot own up to, I mean we just can't.

Speaker 3:          01:05:42       No, no guy. No matter what you do, you make all the money in the world. The guys get a giant Dick and if he, if he bangs or she's going to remember, we did. We did. I remember that thing and you can't pay for it either. I do. We did love line and the open forum was does size matter. It literally every girl, but one was like absolutely do to tell you it doesn't matter. It's wishful thinking, but everything matters. Dr Drew is like now it doesn't matter how silly boy or like, well, no, he said it does matter. Well, he's got a piece on him apparently. Well that's what they told us, but at the end of the day it was funny proof. I need a dick pic dot piece. Yeah. It was like guys, I took karate in high school. Okay. Define peace. Well, I've been doing martial arts since I was a kid.

Speaker 3:          01:06:24       What'd you do? You and your brother hit a brick with a fucking flashlight and your backyard. Every guy exactly. The bench and how fast to run or they were. I ran a four or five 40 mm. Well, the NFL, how much your friend goes? Yeah, I ran a four six in the 40 [inaudible] well, no, you Dan. And he goes, oh, I benched three 85 though. Three times in high school though. Why would he say that though? The Z admitting the first one was a lot. That was bullshit, but I'm an eagle scout scout. I made that shit. I didn't make Eagle Scout. I got a badge. I saw grown man who was an eagle scout at the airport and he was pushing 45 and he was an eagle. So using the full getup. Sure. Well he's molesting kids here. Well he's a scout master. He, is that what it is?

Speaker 3:          01:07:07       Yeah. I mean he might have earned the rank of eagle scouts, boy scouts anymore. He's like running these scout trips. He can make it can make the fire out of two sticky shit. Oh Dude, weird guy joined the military. I remember I was a kid, I was a kid and I was in the boy scouts, so I was probably like between, I would guess it's between, so when I was living in Boston, so I think I was probably like 13 that was when I was in the boy scouts. So it was only in it for like one year, whatever it was 13 I was a week living in Jamaica Plain. And my mom took me to the boy scout thing in this fucking dude. He was a scout master. Was he hitting on my mom like hard and my mom was like blushing and she was trying to be polite about it, but I remember like, this is creepy.

Speaker 3:          01:07:45       This dude's hitting on my mom in front of me and I've got to go camping with this asshole. And he was like, Hey, what's up with your mom? Like she's married to my dad. Fuck off, get getting extra marshmallows and shit. I didn't get any extra modules. I went to camp with a bunch of fucking hoodlums. It was a scary camp. I didn't do any of the shit we're supposed to do. I hid during the day like we're supposed to do all these different activities and took my fishing rod, went down to the lake or I checked out early, show the individual check out right away. Well, with the two doors ricochets okay. Dudes were, he gave kids twos and they're shooting at rocks or hanging out there, but there was like an archery range. And while we're hanging out by the archery range out here and I go, what the fuck is that?

Speaker 3:          01:08:24       And someone goes, it's a ricochet. I go, what do you mean until ricochet? They're like someone over by the rifle range probably hit a rock. I go, it goes all the way. The fuck over here. Like what are you talking about man? Just keep fishing, bro. Is the boy scouts in New Hampshire. Okay. Listen, it's survival of the fittest. They would take kids, pull them out of their cots, like pick, pick their concept and tie them up and leave him in the middle of the woods and it was pitch dark. You couldn't see your hand. I went to camp out there. I got molested. Did you? Yes. What happened? Oh, you talked about that. She doesn't tell a story on the podcast. I don't know. It doesn't matter. It wasn't done. The lesson. When you look girl, you're going to tell us the story. Tell the story though, Denise.

Speaker 3:          01:09:02       Well, yeah, I'll say Greg, suck your Dick. So well no, I woke up with Dan. His name was, uh, with a felt full of my dog and uh, and I own this fall. I had, I had a morning boy hard on and I was like, what's going on? And he was like, doing this. I was like, I do this. You just say, why is he doing this? I remember going, I do this. Why is he, I didn't even, it didn't occur to me. So I go to my buddy Danny, I go probably 11 and I go, I've got my buddy down and go, hey man, this guy, he don't me. I'm like, this guy did, was playing with my Dick and my buddy John goes, he's playing with my Dick too. And Donnie goes, he sucked mine and I go, I'm telling my mom. So I waited like a little tiger in the tall grass.

Speaker 3:          01:09:43       Mine. Yup. Donny. Yes. Dick Sucking ass done repeatedly. He wasn't like real quick island. Helen got molested as a kid. Sure did. I wasn't a violent guy. He was like, he was probably a guy who, he had a beard. I remember with Baldhead, terribly athletic. Not Athletic at all. I threw a ball at, I mean he and he clapped like he was clapping at a bug and then he, he just loved boys and I went and told my mom. What would you tell your mom? How'd you tell your mom? Well, my mom wasn't there so she didn't come for about two weeks. He kept asking me why I wasn't going on more trips cause I was just taken, I was like not sign up from any more canoes. It just that one time, because you were there for two weeks. It was just great for longer than that.

Speaker 3:          01:10:21       I was in camp for two months. I believe I can suck your Dick. No, he never suck my Dick. And he just, he just had it. Well, he was hard. We were all in the tent. It was probably me and like a couple of years and he had his hand in my, in my sleeping bag playing with my little wiener gimme like Jujitsu position. Does he have you inside control? Nope. I'm lying next to him. He's looking, he tit, tense or small pill. There's three kids. He's probably like this too. May sucking done and you off. Well, I know that I was looking at threesome with Dani. I was looking, I will feel up like this. I wasn't a threesome properly. And uh, this explains so much. I know why you fucking rubbing your head. It's gotta be an Internet meme. This explains so much, so much. I was molested.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       It's fucked up to laugh laughing at that. It's so, there's a big going to be the lesson and NBN fucked and so for me, and I just knew minor league millennia. Crazy. If you don't think Dani was fucking them too. No, I think Donny, Donny didn't want me to tell anybody and I was like, I'm telling my mom, I almost got molested by a girl. Came real close. It didn't realize that the guy was creeping on me until the very end he did. I thought it was nice. I thought it was nine but he was getting weird. It was getting weird and was showing up drunk. I used to go fishing near this place called Jamaica pond and Jamaica pond. Was this a place in Jamaica plain where I live that had really good fishing. Like I could walk to it. It seems weird, but that's, you know, Boston and rains lot of like ponds and lakes and shit like sometimes near cities.

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       And this was a real legitimate trout pond. And we'd go fishing there all the time. He'd catch bass, they're trout, but they would stock it with Rainbow Trout. And I loved fishing back then. I fish all the time, the fish everyday afterschool. So much fun. It was just peaceful and it's fun catching fish, you know, it's like one of those things that kids love it. You know, when I caught my first trout, I was like, Holy Shit. Like I brought it in and I picked it up and you know, I took it home and I cooked it. I couldn't believe I caught a fucking trout. And then it, it was very exciting to me. Anyway, this dude used to jog by and he used to talk to me and my friend Josh, Brendan can't stop laughing. We used to go, uh, we used to go fishing at this place all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:12:34       Dudes probably dead now because I was, it was before I moved to Newton. I moved to Newton when I was 14, so I was living in Jamaica Plain. I was probably 13 ish, somewhere around that. And he's probably in his like late fifties. So it comes around and um, you know, he'd ask us about a fishing, like, what do you catch? Like sit down with us for a little bit and talk with us. Very friendly and they take off and he kept doing it like over and over again. Come by. Very friendly, softening, softening us up. Feelers. He would offer us some food. He would give us some food like, or like a cake or something. We'll probably like rub his balls. I have no idea. Right. Probably give you like a cookie. It just had deep in his ass. No idea. I ran it over my crack.

Speaker 1:          01:13:14       Who knows what he did. Right. But I didn't know any better, man. I was 13. I just didn't know any better. I had one experience when I was younger, when I was like seven years old. I was at a library in San Francisco and uh, I was looking at his books and I was, look at these monster books. This guy came up to me like, you like monster books? And I go, yeah. And he was like a month, two books out of my car and go, Oh really? And I start going out to this guy's car. And um, the lady who's the librarian screams out, Joseph, you get away from that man. Dan. Dan just got out of jail. So I run away. Damn Brian, probably going to, who knows who the fuck knows most likely molest man, I dodged. If, if it's a good bark, could be killed me like seven at the most.

Speaker 1:          01:13:55       Most made you, I don't know. I'm a little kid anymore. Scary Shit. So I had, I had that in my past. Like I remembered that, that a dodge, that bullet. So this dude, man, I'm so stupid, man. I had lunch over this guy's house before. Just me and him. Uh, I, this is the word started getting weird. I peed in his bathroom. And one of the things he said to me, he goes, he goes, you're very developed. And I said, what? And he goes, you your penis, your penis is very developed for a boy your age. That's a, that's a very good thing. I was like, oh, okay. But he didn't get creepy with me. I mean, I was top, it was creepy, but you know what I'm saying? Like you'd be as fuck. He didn't try to fuck me. He didn't want it to whatever it was.

Speaker 1:          01:14:34       It was real. It got real weird after that. So that was the probably the beginning of the weirdness. Yeah. So, yeah, so I, uh, I, I definitely told Josh, I was like, dude, he say, he said that, not like my dick was developed and he's looking at my Dick. And Josh was like, whoa. And Josh was an interesting character too. Like he, he, that kid knew a lot of shit he knew about like weird sexual shit, like way early. Um, because, uh, his mom was a lesbian. There's always one of them live with this woman who looked like a truck driver. It was, it was hilarious. Like he, he knew, he knew he was a sharp kid. He's like, dude, he's trying to fuck you. This is going to get ugly. And you know, we were talking about it like, do you think he's a pedophile?

Speaker 1:          01:15:14       Like it was like some weird shit. So anyway, I started avoiding and dude, and then one time I'm fishing. And um, there was two areas. There was one error which make a pond, was, was the big area. And then there's this other smaller pond that was off like, you know, like a few blocks to the left. Sometimes we would go to that pond because if no one ever went there and it did have some good fish in there. And every now and then like get a different kind of fish that had like pick role and most difficult fish. So he shows up. It's just me and him. And this is a kind of an isolated area. There's a lot of trees and shit. It's not like Jamaica pond, which has this big running track sweats. So sketch, this is a sketch and he tells me that he loves me.

Speaker 1:          01:15:51       Yeah, yeah. And uh, I don't know what to do. Like I'm sitting there fishing and I'm like, okay, well, you know, I like you too man. And he goes, no, no, I love you. And there cannot be no true love. There can be no true love without sex. Holy. I remember him saying that and I remember going what, like what and I remember how to knife. Uh, I had a Swiss army knife when those little red plastic handle Swiss army knives and I had it in my pocket and I put my hand on the knife and I didn't want to pull it out but I I, but I wanted to have it on me, you know, and I remember thinking I might have to fucking stab this guy shot. I did go. I Dunno. I mean first of all I'm probably going to get killed.

Speaker 1:          01:16:26       I'm 13. I then know how to fight back and he's a big, it wasn't big. He was bigger than me. He was an old guy, grown ass, grown ass man, a sweat. And if he knew how to fight it off, I was fucked. I didn't have any martial arts experience back then is one of the reasons why I started getting into martial arts is after this I just, I figured I have to know something like this guy, if he beats me up and fuck fucking kills me and stabs me, like no one's going to hear me. I'm out. I'm in this like really kind of wooded area. And so, uh, I told him, you better fucking leave me alone or something like that, you know, whatever words I was able to muster, being scared of my mind at 13. And then, uh, years later after I had moved, this is where it got really creepy. He sent a letter to my house and I was like 16 or 17 or something like that. Yeah. He sent a letter to my house many, many years later he found where I moved to

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       found out where my house was. I could never told him my house the first place. And this guy sent me a letter. It was really creepy, man. I read this long. It was almost like a love letter to me. Oof. It was really creepy. And I just think if I see this guy, Jesus Christ, he was truly and red alert. I might, me and my buddy Michael and Saudi Arabia in love with that Dick, he saw my juicy deck. That's what it was. That's the turning point. That's one of the most traumatic experience for me. I was in Saudi Arabia, my buddy Michael and it started, there was nowhere to place. He would just go play in these like abandoned lots and you know, whatever. We find cars that were all, but he'd bring them up as you doing with 13 year olds do 1413 and I'll never forget, I see a guy, I couldn't understand what the guy was doing it, the trunk of his car.

Speaker 3:          01:17:58       I was like, what is that guy doing? And I realized as I got closer, it was the most bizarre thing. There was a guy in the trunk of the car with his ass out of the car. So he had his ass sticking out of the trunk of the car, this giant hairy ass. And another guy had his robe lifted up and he was standing there, Saudi Arabia fucking the guy in his ass, so I couldn't, I could just see an ass sticking out of a trunk and he had his, I was 13 and my friend Michael and he was jamming. He was fucking him standing up and I was like, and I go there. I go, oh, it's called cold either of us too. And I go, I see it. He looks at me and he didn't say anything. He just looks at me with a blank expression as he's just drilling some poor GIM in the in in some Cadillacs and hyper.

Speaker 3:          01:18:45       I go, Michael, let's run away. I just, I've never run faster. You know what? You can't feel your legs. I was just like scared man. Yeah, Dude. I don't have any molest story then I do. I have another one. I was in crazy one though to that guy. What did he do when he saw you running away from not try to finish her fence? Just looked at me with heavy eyes. I kept banging. The dude kept thrusting. What do you think would have happened if you just stood there? Like unimpressed, like style. Still dumb down. Let me know when you're done. I'll show you how it's done. Let me know when you're finished. Audience member ever at a comedy club. These guys. Oh, that's like the last thing you'd ever want to see you doing that to him while he's fucking the guy in the ass and a trunk.

Speaker 3:          01:19:30       See better molested again. Broke. Well, no, I remember I was, I met an older dude and we were, we were, he was cool guy. We hung out. I always starts with a older dude. We were in Wisconsin sweatsuit, we're in Wisconsin. The Northwoods of Wisconsin didn't summertimes. And I remember I meet this guy and there was this girl, they're all two girls older and we were like, oh, we were there. I don't know, who cares? Let's say 14, 13 or 14 it was so hot and I was 11, 10 something even younger, younger. Cause I'll tell you why. I know I was younger so I, I'm hanging out with this and uh, can we, can we keep, we keep and I'm, I was such a little pervert. How old is he? Well, I'll tell you, I don't know, but I'm going to tell you how I know he was a lot older.

Speaker 3:          01:20:16       Ready? This is how you, this is, this is why I'm going, this is the point. So we start, I actually say we should try sex with those girls. I'm trying to conspire, I don't know how old I was on or at least I was like, we should try to see their boobs. I don't know what I was saying to him. He goes, yes, that's a great plan. So, so we're talking to come, we have to go to the woods and come up with a plan. So No. Yeah. So I'm like, alright. So we go to the woods, have Devin and no wonder you've been molested several. The next thing I know I, this is coming through me now. The next thing I know, he pulls his pants down and I notice how Harry is acid. So I go, that's weird. If there is, there's this dick and his ass and he and he lies down and he goes, do you want her to want to rub on top of me or no?

Speaker 3:          01:20:59       And I go, I don't think so. I was like, I was like rub on me or no, and I was young. I was young. I was young enough to have to think about how, imagine if that's, he's like fucking go too long. I swear to God. How do you get these kids to fuck you dude. This is all you have to do. You lie down and you go, do you want to rub on top of me? No. I saw it was just start fucking you. Couple of kids go spit on your ass and start pounding away. They all do it. It's like hypnosis. What he laid down with her place straight when he wasn't like he was bent lakes. They don't you want to rub on top of me or no, and I go, I don't think I was just hearing ass. Yeah, I saw the crack and I was like, and I was like, do I say yes?

Speaker 3:          01:21:37       I was like, this is vaguely sexual. And I go, no, I don't think so. So then he gets up and he goes, all right, we'll just hold off for a second and he starts, I'm going to show you something. And I go, all right. He starts jerking off and I go, Oh, I've done. I take all my two, two, two. I used to rub it on the bed to test when my mother called it. So I go, so he's, he's, he's winking off and that was the first time he goes, hold on, ready, ready? And I go, yeah, and he comes on you, he busted in your face. Not on my face. He just shoot. And I go, what the fuck? I go, what's that white? I couldn't believe as soon seeing white stuff is the first time I saw somebody, a jacket. Hold on.

Speaker 3:          01:22:14       Jeez. You were watching this dude jack off in the woods for a solid four minutes. Hey Man, what were you saying to him? I don't remember. It was so long ago. He goes to Jim on, hold on. You called this Mr. Yeah, hold on. He was like, watch this, wait for it. Wait a minute, hold on. Wait for it. Yeah. And then we went, then we left and we went and spied on those girls. You hung out with him after that? I did a shirt that you watched a grown man Jack off bus near you. Not on your face. Then you went to go find chicks. So you know what man, when you were 11 years old, Weird Shit can happen to this 11 year old hockey. Hell No. You got lucky. But I'm not saying that would have happened. You would've stood around while the guy jerked off. But I am saying it's possible that a guy when you were 11 could have lied down and say, Hey, you want to rub on top of me or no? And you would have been like, what the fuck you would have said no. 100% no I didn't say no for sure.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       No, I don't thought about it cause I thought that looks like pure Breslin. The guide be down there. You might be surprised. I was surprised. 10 that's a girl I could rub against that. If it's a girl, what? Wait, hold on. You revealing. Just like, is this a confession? You want it to last a little bit of it out and we were talking about funny shit. You're like, no, no, no, no. I still have to add some stuff that I did. That was because I was thinking about this just last week guys and I looked like the iron sheik in his prime gets fuck monster hairy asshole smells like woods. Another fucking bothers me about the story is you watched him for several minutes, Jack. Sure did. I didn't know. I just didn't know what was found a video of the guy. We have the guy pull up that video of my, uh, on my Twitter feed of the Russian dude doing kettle bells in the snow with no shirt on.

Speaker 2:          01:24:06       This is why you shouldn't fuck with Russians. There are different kinds of human and everybody's freaking out about this Putin stuff like Putin assassinate or allegedly Putin is actually investigating it and he's quite upset that he's, and he wrote a letter to the guy's mother. So anyway, bottom line is to, Russia is a different fucking, it's a different beast. He's, he's still stuck on the jacking off this dude. There's a video. This dude, he's in the fucking snow in Russia and he's doing the man maker. It's on the Keith level. Weber, a Kettlebell cardio workout series. He does the entire, uh, the entire man maker. No fucking shirt on. Run the winter. Hard to tell how much that kettlebell ways it's he, it depends on the construction of it. It's either 35 pounds or 50 pounds. That honored bill. No, no. This is the motherland.

Speaker 2:          01:24:51       They don't want on it up there. It's probably about, it's probably, it looks about 50 pounds right in shape too. Yeah. Oh fuck. Yeah. He is. Watch them do this shit, man. The dude's stacked. He does this with no shirt on. He ain't fucking Russia in the winter. And he talks Russian to his dog who waits for him. You know why? You know, why different briefs? That's guys throwing this fucking 50 pound kettlebell round. Like it ain't shit. And he's doing it over and over again. Switch hands and neck size. Russian history. That's was a distillation process. Deep. Some warrior genetics you're looking at here. This guy's all fucking stud. Oh by the way, he might be 70 on both of you are lucky this then the guy who's trying to fuck both of you. Damn right about that. Well he listened to like a tall fellow.

Speaker 2:          01:25:35       He's not a very big phony short for sure. But this guy's a tank cause he's rattling these fucking, I mean I don't know how much that weighs. It might only be 35 pounds heavier. Looks like a 50 to me. I looked like a sound. How fever? No, it would be 72 I think. 70 or 72 heavy Joe. I don't know. It might be the size of his head. Yeah, but there's some ones that they make that are really light. It looked like that, but they're really light. I'm going to say that's heavy. Like if you see those colored ones, he ever see the that are colored

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       light. It's fun and they're big. They look like you're, you're using superhuman strength and it's like 30 pounds. But that same, that thing is as big as that. His Russian hat, he's got a Russian hat that looks like a, like a real, a dragon door style or one of the Onnit ones. It's all cast iron. If that's the case, that's probably 50 pounds is just way tough for them to look at this motherfucker. He's just switching hands clean press the whole entire time we've been talking. This guy has never taken a break. It's just thrown around this 50 pound Kettlebell kinda awesome. I gotta I gotta take my Kettlebell workouts way more serious. Those ankle weights and fucking let's get physical socks. The people behind them freezing a lot of raw live there. Better wins. That's a good time to live there. Huh? This guy's an animal.

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       This is the best way to stay warm in the winter. Just keep doing this. Maybe this is a strategy. You know how you go to those cryotherapy places and they keep the inflammation down? Maybe if you do like fucking heavy workouts like this while you in the middle of a snowstorm, it might actually aid your performance. Bad idea. You know what I'm saying? Because like you know what this guy's doing, this is all about the burnout. These are all like high rep exercises. He's doing everything flowing, had blood's flowing, pushing the inflammation out. He's doing one arm presses and then full deep squats. So this guy in the course of us watching him, we're assuming that's about 50 pounds, has probably done like what? 30 or 40 deep squats with that 50 pound kettle bell over his head and he continues to do it. He's an animal.

Speaker 1:          01:27:32       Yeah, he's in there. I look at them, but doing it like this, watts freezing, I would no shirt on it. Also, it makes you keep the pace up. You don't want to get cold. Those socks. Chow. That's a child. The dog is a child that isn't gentle. Socks are perfect. He's got Olivia Newton, John Blair and his Russian built car, I think their ankles, my Funko windmills, son, windmills. After all this with that 50 pounds, that shit is not easy. I guess that's a challenge. It's one of those, yeah, that's what we're pushing dog and that's a chow. It's 100% chow. 100% chat. By the way, are they rushing to say, oh, there they are. Chinese. Yeah, he's right next to Russia. A good point. All right, motherfucker. Dead thing wandered into his yard one day. Come with me, your friend. Comrade. Comrade. You live with me.

Speaker 1:          01:28:15       I give your scripts. Get little bells. You Bark when people come to me and die. Kill a little bit on this. I see as this one. The fuckers working hard. That's a hundred reps deep though. Yeah, he's working hard, man. Yeah, he's a stout little man. This is a savage fucking workout for a no shirted man in the middle of the snow. That dude once rape kids were all fuck that dog doesn't give a fuck about the cold. By the way. I look at him. That dog might have no experience on. Yeah, it's pretty dope to be a dog like that. And I live in a place like that. Everybody else is suffering. Let's take this thing and do you think homeless dogs have the best just the best lives of any dog? Cause they're outside all the time and so they do feed them, but they're out.

Speaker 1:          01:28:52       You know what I'm saying? Like this raise their dogs are pack animals. So as long as they have a pack to be with, yes, they're alone. No, no, no. I'm saying they have a owner, but he's homeless. This Russian mother fucker has not stopped at somebody. He's a dub us talking about this guy over his video and send it to them. Respect, respect, respect. We give to you respect. Sure. He's a bad ass. Fucking savage. Look at him. He's still going. He's still going. That guy. That's a lot of Goddamn reps. This guy's got a really good shit. He's a crossfitter. Please. Little didn't salt the pleas from mother lent these sorts of kettle bells then I do. Gosh, I drink vodka all night. Have you ever seen that picture of young fade or in front of kettle bells? No. Maybe one of the best pictures ever have a fucking post training session.

Speaker 1:          01:29:38       Really that training session, great super athletes cause the kettle bells being a Russian invention. You know, like you see fade or widow. His kettle bells around him. It sort of signifies like this was a different motherfucking man made from iron sambo champion. Oh, booking photo God damn son. And he was thin while he had very little body fat, but he was very thick muscle. Look at them back on that. He had a less body fat back then but more muscle. He was a big fucker. But that's also, he's pumped. Like he's probably just worked out and once you get real thick cause you're all pumped up, you don't get more masculine Danette. That dude? Nah. How about the fact that he never gave a fuck about his gut?

Speaker 1:          01:30:17       He's rushing. Give a fuck. Just one in there dropping bombs. He married, he's been married and divorced a couple of times. He does paintings and shit. Yeah he does. He does art like drawings and she goes, not the best shit you've ever seen. Well it's not bad. It's like cartoon weird. It's weird. It's like the shit like a real serial killer thinks. Oh for sure. Well no they're not. They're smashing people's heads and his brother's a fighter and was spent a lot of time in jail. I think Wright brothers, a maniac, call level prison tattoos like his, his on his back. There's a picture of like the angel of death holding a baby. Well that's not case prison tattoo shit. You never seen it. We'll get, we'll pull that up. Alexander a million INCOSE tattoos. He's in jail right now for rape. Oh No. Yeah, I don't really buy night.

Speaker 1:          01:30:58       He did it, but he has, he's definitely an alcoholic. He definitely gets drunk and he's very different than fade or was fate or is like completely composed, like very disciplined. Alexander also had some like some significant losses, like he lost in pride to Mirko. Mirko head kicked him. Yup. Yeah. But this is like, look at his back. It's like the angel of death holding a baby. It's weird. Yeah. He's got weird. Like he had these ones on his, um, on his shoulders, but he had them taken off. It was like they had these gang tattoos on his shoulders, but he had them removed and change to some sort of pattern. He's a, he's a, you think anyone's fucking with that guy in prison? Jesus Christ. Not a good idea. He's got kind of knocked James Thompson out in about 15 seconds, right? Yeah. He's a beast dude.

Speaker 1:          01:31:43       Alexander million. Nicole was abused, you know, I mean he got knocked out by cro cop, but he fought cro cop when cro cop was just on fire. Do you think that there's, there's dudes that just like, they hit this like Bj Penn level, like Bj Penn when he beat Sanchez. Bj Penn when you know, he was like at his very best. Like this is only like a couple of years. You can keep that intensity. I think it's only a couple of fights. I don't even think it's a year. Yeah. Do you think that maybe that's where Cain is right now. That's why he's getting all these injuries. That's his fucking junior dos Santos wars. We just so insanely taxing. I think junior junior is not the same after those awards either. No, I don't think so either. But you got to remember too, back in those pride days, those guys were fighting a lot more frequent.

Speaker 1:          01:32:25       So we got the seed the very best when they're at their prime and now in the UFC, you know, you fight, if you, if you, if you're a start two times a year, maybe three granted people and say, Oh cowboy that I'm talking about. You know when a guy got a superstar, he's fighting maybe twice a year now think it was back in the day, we'd see him three, four times. And you remember when they used to make these fights, they there put the fight together within like three or four weeks of the fight. Yeah, it would be like, it would be like what happened in the UFC when there's a fallout would happen in pride all the time. It would happen in pride instead of like you having like eight weeks to prepare. Like they would tell you like a couple of weeks out. Like occasionally there would be like a long wait.

Speaker 1:          01:33:00       You knew like when uh, the Open Weight Grand Prix tournament pretty much we knew who it was. But then last minute like guys, we're getting added. Josh Barnett I think was a one of the later additions. I might be wrong about that though. But I mean you look at that lineup, Barnett Nogueira Cro, cop hunt like Jesus, fuck the same price in those days cause motherfuckers on the planet. Yeah, it's, it's, it's interesting when you think about that time, the wild west days of a, of pride. No head stomps and soccer kicks on the ground. When Vandelay fought to Maura, it was holding off the rope and stomping on his face. Bro was cro cop fuck Ron. Ron Waterman and soccer kicked him in the face. I forgot about that flight. Yeah. And Brian wanted me to ate it too. He ate a couple of water, a lot of them. It was one of my first training partners.

Speaker 1:          01:33:48       Big flat me out with his titties. Got It in my garden. Just smothered me with this. Teddy's that strong man. Oh, it's broke my nose. Yeah. I knew nothing at the time. My training partner was Ron watermen in Shanghai with my first two training partners. So they were just rotating on me and just dismantled me. Terrible idea. I wish I was your friend back then. That'd been nice. No one says, Shit Dude, this Shane Shane was like, now it's making the tough man. I'm like, I know. I'm like, I know man. But he liked tap me out with his titties and super embarrassed. It's happening. You have the titties is the least of your concerns. That is the least of your concerns. We didn't spar. I'll thank God. But you know what Ron? Ron used to whoop my ass and then four years down the road be shoveled, work on stand up.

Speaker 1:          01:34:33       And he comes into spar. Yes, me and Shane put it on him. Well he was a big guy, but he didn't move that good. No, he's real stiff but so strong. Crazy strong. Do you remember Dan [inaudible]? No. God Damn Damn Bovis was dude who was in the, he lost a Mark Kerr in the UFC where Kirk got on top of them is stuck his chin. His eye socket. Well used to be allowed to uh, stick your chin in someone's eye socket. So Dude's would get ahold of your head. They would shove their chin like you get, like they'll get the mount or something like that. You know, any position where they get on top of and they can balance out and they would get their hand behind your head and then get your fucking Chin right in your eyeball. Just squeeze and you know your, your eyes on fire, you get blowout fractures, your eyes guys are seeing sparks and shit.

Speaker 1:          01:35:21       Shit, you got a giant man like Martin never thought of that and that's fine. If you could find that is a mark. Kerr taps Dan Bobe ish with his chin. Yeah, it was there, dude. I interviewed him afterwards. There was the glory days when I lie jacked up. Oh yeah. He had a tap man. Suddenly you have the best body and those American flag shorts. Any bird. Nice guy too. Yeah. Great Guy. Cruz, this guy mark marker two 62 60. Always a very, very cool dude. Regardless of what was going on in his life. If you saw Mark Curry was your boy Ken shamrock explaining again. Yeah, he's fighting Kimbo.

Speaker 1:          01:35:59       Yeah. And you don't want to say I liked about it. What he said, he goes, uh, he goes, I've earned the right to fight for fun. He goes, yeah, I'm doing it for money. You know, you know I'm a professional, but I've earned the right to fight for fun. He goes, I don't want it. He goes, I don't want to go play golf. He goes, I don't want to go hiking. I don't want to go hunting. I don't want to go fishing. He goes, I like fighting. He goes, I like the comradery that comes or preparing for a big fight. I enjoy it, but I'd love the way he said it and you know, it's like very honest and refreshing and it's true. He did it. God Damn all times legend. He's a legend, you know, and all the famous, and he had some fucking great technique back in the day, man.

Speaker 1:          01:36:30       Ken shamrock man, go to the early UFC. He tap Pat Smith and fucked his leg up. That heel hook can Shamran dropdown for that heat. Pat Smith had no idea what the fuck was going on. I was fighting in Japan right way before fight in Pancrase fought. He fought a bunch of cars. We Fun Pride for a while. He had some good fights in pride. Man. Ken shamrock had some, he was developing some pretty decent stand up like remember that fight where um, you know, like the PD, my heart, like you had something going on with his heart, like his heart was beating too fast and one of his fights, I remember that like they stopped the fight. I think it was Fujita but he was putting it on them before that. Like I was really impressed with his star is striking. Like Ken Shamrock doesn't get enough credit because he fought Tito Ortiz when he was already past his prime and his knee was fucked up when he fought Tito the first time he fought Tito.

Speaker 1:          01:37:15       He basically didn't have an ACL. Wow. Like he was fucked up. I was at that fight with you and after the fight it was crazy. Like, you know, Tito is still mad at him. And Ken said to him, he's just real honest about it. He goes, hey man, we made some money. You know, we made some money so let it go you, you won. Congratulations. And he gave him a hug and like, you could see Tito like notice what we calm down and he'll, Tito was still mad even after he kicked his ass. Cause all the trash talking. Ken's like, look, look what happens. Like all this trash talk. We'd both made a lot of money. It's over you one, you know, like, yeah, but then we can very mellow handled though. Then they the second money get mad. Yeah, you're right. Get this money son.

Speaker 1:          01:37:52       I remember you and I were, we talked to Tito after that fight. I remember that long time ago. We went there. Well, I ran into Ken at a diner at like one o'clock in the morning, the night of the fight he was eating and uh, identify that before it like, you know, it was into the morning. I just want to talk in the morning, the day of, if he's going to fight the next day when he's out at a diner. And uh, he was real, he had been through so much, just fought so many times. He goes, hey man. He goes, it only hurts after it's over. Yeah. That's going. He's like laughing about it. He's like, so I'm going to go fight tomorrow. Like that was his attitude about it. This is Mark Kerr and Dan mobish. Let's see if we could see the video of him putting his fucking chicken is eye.

Speaker 1:          01:38:31       So he got them in side control. Beautiful back. Certainly did and but Dan Babish is God damn enormous. I look at it, look at, just to see the way he's grabbing his head with his arm. So he gets inside control and he gets on top of him. Can you see it? They have a good angle. Poor production team back then. Full mouth. Chin in the eyeball. You can't see it and that angle, man, I'll maybe can't see it. I don't think. I don't think they have a, he goes to mountain here will be. That was it. I mean that was the tap. It's over. But this is the full sequence. Let's see it. Look how strong. She's like, bitch, you ain't going nowhere. Mark Curve back. And then I saw that one 88 in college too, by the way. Well, you know what, man, he had a lot of Korean team in his diet.

Speaker 1:          01:39:17       He certainly did. And um, he's, he's fine with pride and he definitely didn't take steroids then. Right? Is that true? It'd be crazy to assume that. Well, you know what man, that documentary, it was super brave smashing machines. Super brave of him. I mean he basically left them document his ascension into drug addiction and a lot of that came from fighting like painkillers and shit. He got addicted to and it was everything. Steroids, painkillers, like he's a great guy. And let me seen that documentary. It's good. Yeah, it's pretty good. This is actually pretty fucking good technique here for the day or passing guard is Kurt was a hell mouth. Our big collegiate wrestlers, we sound like boats. He can't really see it here, but he's got his chin in. His fucking eyeballs are going to grab his eye looking at grandma's. I look at him say, yeah, I remember that man that was back in, look at the size hard.

Speaker 1:          01:40:09       God Damn, that's a big man. Yeah. Cause I said you wrestled at one 88. He goes, yeah, put a little miracle grow on my cereal. I don't really, yeah. Yeah. Just different animals. How's he doing now? I'm not so good. It was selling cars for a while. I lost a shit ton of weight. Um, he fought a few times since I got knocked out by King Mo and he looked like really? Actually that's right. King Mo smashed him in the first round. It was really not fun to watch. It looked bad. He went to sleep and you could tell like he was in a bad spot and then um, and he wound up retiring from MMA. Sold some cars. Dan, I don't know what he's doing now. Hoping to him. Well I hope so too. He was a good dude. He's always a good dude, but he definitely had his demons, man. Like a lot of those dudes. I mean you were talking about it, you know that it hit you for a few months cause God damn pain pills

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       man, you can get, you can get those demons can fucking haunt you when you can get stuck day pain pills and the most dangerous drug in the world. Hands down. There's nothing more dangerous than prescription pills. They're trying to slow that down. They're trying to cut back in America. I mean there's, there's, there's started passing too much money should be made. What was too much you're talking about, cause also oxytocin, all the hot and Oxycontin, oxytocin. But the, um, the thing being, there's still so much profit. Even if they cut back, there's still over this, there's just too many. I mean I get the, I get the idea like what would you rather do if you had like severe pain all the time? Would you rather be addicted to opiates and just deal with that pain and be fine? Or would you rather be absolutely miserable and sober all day long?

Speaker 2:          01:41:37       And I think you have the right and as an adult to choose to be fucked up on opiates, but they're addicting. Like you have to depend on them. And then you also got to realize when you take painkillers, it sends a message to your body. It says, oh, we're doing fine. It's healed. We don't need to send those receptors to heal the muscle or bone, whatever it is. So you're fucked man. Or You could smoke marijuana, God damn dude. Damn. Or you can eat marijuana. You know, whichever. You can really get that CBD oil that people are using to help tumor. It's crazy. Inflammation, pain, painkillers. You get stuck on him. You're in trouble. You're in trouble. Yeah. It's, I think I've come up with a way to heal injuries that they don't have today and we're going to look back at these days like it was the dark ages.

Speaker 2:          01:42:17       Like you know how we look at back at using leeches and shit. When they had a saw people's legs off and they broke. They didn't add up then and I'll put rods inside your bone, like Anderson Silva's leg, guess what's on? We're going to have to take that sucker off. They would do back then it would faster and rot. They wouldn't know what to do with it. You die most of the time for antibiotics and see, probably braced it and some people survive. What are the odds that you are getting both legs connected perfectly? I mean it's like both bones rather. It's like snapped in half. I had an orthopedic surgeon tell me that if you, if you're like in the wilderness, somebody gets a compound fracture and I said, what do you do? And he said, Paul, what do you mean? He said, your bone wants to go back in place.

Speaker 2:          01:42:54       Take that ankle, pull it out, pull it out and, and the bone, we'll reconnect. And then splits. They're just supposed to line it back up. Yup. He said pull that fucker right out. Oh, and that's exactly what they do to you. They will pull. Really? Do you ever see somebody that a doctor reset a shoulder when it comes out of the socket that's inefficient. Break up my arm and I was a little kid. I remember them setting it freaked me the fuck out. He should pull your up. My arm went like that. Like it was like bent up that I fell on the monkey bars and I try to block myself with my hand and it just, my forum just snapped and just went crack. Oh yeah. It happens a lot happened to my daughter. I have all the jobs. Yeah, lot of kids. My friend's daughter and happened to um, another kid that's they're friends with half.

Speaker 2:          01:43:42       But when you're a kid swinging good, right. Cause it's so young, they heal so quick. It's amazing. Their bones just go. They just fuse up. They take the cast off in three weeks. Soft and everything. Yeah Dude, they grow like whoa. And the, the thing is I'm with little kids. What's one of the big issues is not even the bone healing, uh, that quickly cause it heal so quickly that it, as long as it's set correctly and heals very quickly, but it's the stiffness but you don't want to lose the range of motion. So that's like my daughter had issues with, she had to go through some range of motion stuff that takes a couple of weeks before their motion comes back. But you compare it to like the way you would be if you broke your arm at 48 long time, but take a long fucking time.

Speaker 2:          01:44:18       You know, it's, it's rough. Especially if you don't use help, which is one of the reasons why I was willing to forgive Anderson and, and not, not forgiving. You understand. He doesn't need my forgiveness. I'm just saying like one of the reasons why I go, look man, I'm, I'm judging the dude before he fought Chris Weidman. I'm judging them up to this point when she's 38 years old and he gets knocked dead by this young stud. Agree. I go that guy before. That is the best hour. Yep. And this guy is a host fail test. There's the post failed test is what sucks. I can't, I can't speak about this cause I know some shit that I'm not supposed to know or that I'm not, that's not out there yet. And once it does get out there and then we can talk about it. But the person who told me about it, a jet legit and we don't have time.

Speaker 2:          01:44:56       We just missed this one thing for sure. For sure. He took some Shitty, wasn't supposed to take to make his leg healed for sure. Can't explain it. There's a, there's a really goofy explanation. I'll explain after the show. Cool. But it'll all come out. Albert Watson. I don't know what happened there man. I heard a couple of different stories. I've heard story but I'm just saying we don't have details. It just sucks. He's gone man. Yeah, he quit. Apparently that's the word is that he quit. He got in an altercation with someone or something. I Dunno what happened or he just got tired of it, man. The guy was traveling to fucking China and traveling all over this place and that place in Brazil. He's the manager of Joe Frazier. Yeah, he's been around a long time. Crazy. Right. And really one of the best human beings you've ever met.

Speaker 2:          01:45:35       One of the nicest guys ever. I Dunno what happened. They don't make too to Burt Watson's. Yeah, I agree it replaceable. I gave him that nickname babysit to the stars. Oh really? Yeah. That was my nickname when he got on stage, when he would get on stage, say a Burton Watson Babysit to the stars because that's what he does, man. He babysits everybody. He makes, he makes everybody's experience with the UFC smooth and easy. It takes care of all your shit. And so that like when these fighters would fight, like they would have this welcome feeling of like being at home. Cause Burt Watson was there to take care of. You were talking about that how when you'd see him, everything would be okay. Yeah. I mean when you're going to fight these monsters and you check into the fight or hotel and it's like chaos. There's fans and then you see Burton.

Speaker 2:          01:46:14       He's just like, what's up baby? Everything's smooth. Made me just feel calm. Even in back in the lock room. Don't leave it to the judges. Like before I fought Travis Browne, remember La, don't leave it to the judges. Boss. Don't leave to the judges. They made you cry last time I told you and he talks to him. There's this comfort level where I don't know if anyone else in the world could do it, man. And he was so damn good at it. He's a, he's a genuinely, really nice guy, great human beings. So when he's doing that, you know, he's pumping everybody up. That's his nature. His nature is to pump you up, to make you feel good. He wants you to feel good when you see Bert Kreischer every, there's not a time that I saw that guy that I didn't

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       give him a big giant hug. Bert Kreischer you're talking about referral, right? I'm sorry, Watson, but Watson who said crusher crusher? I was like, yeah, well he's another one. I was like, that's probably going to be here tomorrow. He's a great guy. Nice. But Bert Watson, sorry, [inaudible] guy. He would make guys on the new card feel like they're the main event. You would every one you felt like you were literally the only guy fighting that night. Like you'd just amazing. But every time you'd see them you'd hug them. Just like that's what it was. Just such a switchable, listen tangible. Some people just have that, that quality that makes sort of, well you know what the problem is man, it seems like a job that other people could do. So it says like, you know, maybe sometimes you think you always appreciate. It seems like when you look at it like what's he doing?

Speaker 1:          01:47:30       It's so important. You know? Like, why is this guy, why is he getting all this attention? Like sometimes they look on paper, what he does. You can't like it's not, there's not a job description. Okay. Oh you deal with divas and deal with some of the toughest guys on the planet and you, you know, he makes sure their weakest, smooth. I get it. Yeah, I can do that. I'm telling you man, it's going to be a beast. Yeah. I mean I think other people probably could do it but no one's going to replace him. He has his own unique individual and you know, he's a beautiful guy to be around. Like I just think that's worth something. You know, I don't know. I would've never let the dark, I have a weird, like this guy we used to train American bulldogs to for attack train and he had this dog on a leash called acts and we went and saw all this dogs cause at the time I was thinking about buying an American bulldog and he said he can't go near that dog over there.

Speaker 1:          01:48:16       I said okay guys. Hey, he's, he's by trainees and amazing mean boy in and everything. And then they were talking about how there was a guy who just could walk up to every single dog he had in that whole lot. He had a bunch of them. And uh, one point acts is just the only person that acts that's near him is this dude. And they didn't tell him not to go up to ax and he walked up to ax and the next thing you know, he saw the guy get down on his knees and opened his arms and acts and acts was wagging on Max's wagon. I said, rip his, he just had a, he had a thing with dogs. That's matter how Sam's experience, some people just have a, I wonder if it's an the retarded, the dog recognizes they're too stupid to know any better.

Speaker 1:          01:48:59       Yeah. So talk to us and fight their face off. God, man, who knows when I was going to do a movie, when I was going to do a movie a long time ago, I can't remember the name of the movie, actually got released and it was about a French soldier in the desert who meets a leopard and they have directed by a woman named Lavinia career. And I had a meeting with her and she said, well, we're looking for an actor. Um, the only issue is that they, the leopard will either like you or it won't like you. If it doesn't like you, it will never like you. If it likes you, you'll be fine. And that was a huge part of getting cast in the role. And I said, what does it, what does it, how does it know? How does it know? And she said, we don't know. It's maybe a cent or however your move, but it likes you. You get the part. So getting the parts one thing and then you'd have to go through the leopard tests. Oh, I was like very, did you go through the level

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       of depth? Sure. Didn't. I didn't know. So what were you thinking when he gets on his knees in front of the dog? I'm sorry, I didn't see that. I didn't see it. I was just told the story. I don't like those stories that you weren't there for tell those guys store. Yeah, those are not good. You know why? Because they might be bullshit. I hate those styles out there. Yeah, but it might have been exaggerated. Dogg might've been super friendly. So video is a wiener dog. Red At all my friend's dog house and they're like, yeah. Everybody's like, oh, it's dog. Scary on the quick cause this is German shepherd as a family doc comes over wagging its tail. Everyone thinks their sweet. Well, we're talking about the difference between a liar and an exaggerator, right? Yeah. You just, you just took me down a journey where you don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:50:31       You have no veracity. Your likes your tent. You're Brian Williams of the podcast and saying you'd see escaped one. I'm Ronda Rousey's our virus. It's called really nice. Fuck when you're in these guys. Six months, man. What the fuck ever, dude, it's over son. You guys a crazy America. Forget, oh no press conference. No one can do that. Listen, if I'm wanting to be a fucking newscaster tomorrow, if it wasn't for my checkered past tomorrow ain't doing it tomorrow. It's a clean wreck. This way too many endorsements of illegal drugs of mine on and I are friends. We're friends. If you found out, I told a major lie like that Doug story of the Taekwondo, which one? I mean I've told a lot of stories and you found out that I was just a liar. There's a big difference, man. That's where you go. I've got to reassess everything now.

Speaker 3:          01:51:30       Brian Williams is doing it for ratings like there's a lot of competition out there and he went, yeah, I was in this helicopter. He heard of a helicopter crash and he's just putting himself, giving them too much credit. I think you're, you're, you're saying that he's like, this is a calculated move, but that's stupid. You know why? Because the true story is still awesome. Okay. Here's the true story. The true story. He's in a helicopter. There's a helicopter convoy of three helicopters. The one in front of them gets hit with an RPG. They have to force land in a fucking sand storm and they're stuck in the sand star for two days. That stories awesome and that story is true. That's a true story you're missing. What you're missing is is he was three and a half hours behind the one that hit with, I heard what you said, but this is what the fuck the pilots said.

Speaker 3:          01:52:13       The pilots said that's not the case. The pilot said they landed an hour late because they had to get rid of their cargo. They had a full load of cargo. They landed, they got rid of their cargo and then they met up with the other helicopter. I got hit by the RPG. That's why they were an hour behind it. Yeah. They were all story then, but this is, the guy says they were all in a convoy and the helicopter pilot even said that the, the helicopter that Brian Williams was on took small arms fire. Okay. Then when he landed he a, or then when he told his story to other people came out and said, no, they were the guys that were flying, Brian Williams

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       around and he didn't fly him around. And so he's like, you know what? I don't even know anymore. He said, I have suppressed this so much and this is a guy who was a totally legit guy and he said, I'm starting to get nightmares again and I had already put this behind me. Now you're making me relive this experience from 12 years ago and I'm starting to question my own memory, which is super common in traumatic situations like for Brian Williams, let's be real. I don't know that dude, but I guarantee you he's a pussy. I guarantee you whatever you're selling, he's never been in a fight in his life. The way he apologized, the way, I mean this, I mistakenly plated the two stories. Maybe you did, maybe it didn't. That's not the way it Goddamn man apologized and fucking up. He should have done was instead of doing it online or that way where you're in some constricted time of 15 seconds, they allot you to try to clear your name.

Speaker 2:          01:53:33       You should do it on a youtube video. You should put a goddamn camera in front of you. And as long as it takes to get your full thoughts out about how this possibly could have happened or a debt you did lie or what it was or that you got caught up in it and somebody repeated it and you almost forgot because you kept telling us to whatever the fuck it is. The actual story is pretty God damn good. Yeah. At least according to the helicopter, the helicopter pilot said that is, and then the helicopter pilot came out the next day and said he's not even sure of his own memory and so he doesn't want to talk about it anymore, which is, that guy's fucking prerogative. So what do you think should happen to Brian Williams? You don't think she read your news. You're not telling me the news.

Speaker 2:          01:54:08       Your rescue artists do something outside. Go host a talk show. Yeah. It goes to talk show. He's the first one ever to lie, not, but you can't get caught. You can't get caught as a, as a news liar, you know what I mean? It's like he's the face of NBC News. Okay. How about this? What did you found out that a dude was pitching for the world series and he got paid off by some gambling organisation to throw the game. Would you ever trust that guy to fucking pitch a legit game again? Would you ever know? But Anderson Silva told me didn't take steroids. He's still your number one guy, but Brian Williams can't tell the news these days. I think it's fun and Anderson Silva at the end of his career definitely did take steroids at the end of this girl. I'm different though. It was when he had a broken leg and he's 39 years old, which you, he'll slow as fuck and I'm with you.

Speaker 2:          01:54:52       I get all mad did you shouldn't do it, but it's totally illegal. I'm with you. I, what I'm saying is when I say Anderson's the best of all time, I'm not taking away his previous accomplishments because he fucked up when he was 39 years old. When I'm saying is if I look at him in his prime from Chris Liebing all the way to Vitor Belfort to fucking the Stephan Bonner, if I look at his fights, Dan Henderson, and we assume he's clean, we assume he's clean. All right. Do we do not know. Okay. We obviously don't do not know. Do not. I'm not saying he did. If he really was clean, I, I give him the benefit of the doubt. He never failed a test and I say that he was the best ever. The benefit of the doubt, but fate or has more benefit because fatal or never tested positive. True. Even though he was in a dirty league, I mean we could call it a dirty league, right? We pride 100% hundred percent. Right. We nosing fighters. When we say dirty, we don't mean that disrespectfully. It was still the environment that they were competing. I say, okay,

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       so fade or has way more benefit of the doubt because he never tested positive, but yet it wasn't even tested until he came to strike bro. All I'm saying is, so Brian Williams basically tests positive for this one time. The whole line is, so we're just giving assume hall. It's bullshit. You Trust Brian Williams to give, to deliver information. He is a journalist. That pupil is, Helen did journalists credibility and an organization's credibility is everything when it comes to the news. When you're a journalist and you have a story, you have to have, I think that depending on where you're at, they they cross check your references. You've got to get very, very good sources and I think an editorial board has to okay it. That's why we trust the news in my opinion. When someone like Brian Williams lies and he blatantly lied and it was self aggrandizement, it was about making himself look not only like a sympathetic character, but a grandiose character.

Speaker 3:          01:56:33       He exaggerate will more than an exaggeration. It's a lie. It's an absolute blatant lie, and everybody uses these euphemisms and and like, well, he wasn't forthcoming. No, it's okay that you lied. It was a fight and he really thought that he was in the helicopter that got hit by shit too bad. Right, right, right. But what if it's like the Oj Simpson thing? Like people thought that Oj Simpson literally believed at the end of his time as a free man, that he hadn't killed his wife. There's people that knew him that had said this in interviews. They said, I really believe that he doesn't believe he killed her. Like he got it in his head like he, he 2010 his brain, he didn't know. But then who knows? But that, that would be the not civil, the civil lawsuit. He was true. But the courts have recognized that too.

Speaker 3:          01:57:16       Right? They recognize some, that's the degree of mental delusion or whatever it is, and saying, Brian Williams shouldn't be out of a job for lying. I don't want to hurt the guy. I don't think he said should those little, let's be honest about this. First of all, he made a dossier of Brian Williams lives investigating suspense accounts. Okay, he's, there you go. He's done there. If they're doing that with, what's the date on that again? Boy, boy. So he's like more than once. That's all done. He's dossier, but that's how it screws is. That's how it always is. That's maybe just exaggerate this one time and let's do it that way. That's not human behavior. That's not human it when people steal, when you, somebody steals money from you and they go in and they take money, they got a history of I disagree. Well we don't know the situation.

Speaker 3:          01:57:59       You don't know if you're right. Sometimes there can be desperate for money. I can understand that. I'm just saying that typically when people behave a certain way and they get caught, they've probably done something like that in the past. You disagree? I don't think you know, it's, it's very possible to be as what it is very possible that he hasn't, but if they do have a dossier of lies and I'm 10 years suspicions have kind of been confirmed. Yeah, he screwed. Yeah, he's fun. But it's also, it's like it doesn't mean that he can't work, and by the way, he was making $10 million a year. He's bald is fine. Just make it a lot of fucking money. That guy is going to be fine. I really don't give a shit if my newscasters or, oh, you're crazy, man. I don't want that to make you angry. You should get a watch this puppet, this fucking state run puppet. All of them are about this. They're not, they're

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       not all puppies do you mean CNN didn't read all those guys spending $10 million because you trust him because he's a face of credibility. The reason Brian Williams made $10 million a years because he was the face of NBC News and when you brought them into your living room like everybody did, what, what happened was you do that because when you get news from him, you believe it. Oh, that's why you're watching or not watching fiction. I didn't trust them from the get go. I don't want assume these are worldclass great Americans give, delivers the news. Well, we're a dummy for basically a corporation. We're telling you what to say. You exaggerate the news. I mean, you're being, you're also being sympathetic simplistic about this. Okay. But he's not really, because all Brian Really Williams credentials. I mean, what, what does he need to be able to do that you can't do or that you can't do with it?

Speaker 2:          01:59:28       I can't do so reading off, I'm not good at reading off teleprompters, but that's all he has to do. Telegenic is used to doing that. He looks like someone's Dad. He's a good height. He's got good facial, are reserved for that. That's what they hired his speeches. But he's not particularly a brilliant guy. I had a conversation off the record once, uh, I won't say the guy's name, but he's one of those news guys and I was shocked at how dumb he seemed like we were having a conversation about, and I, and I questioned him on a couple of things were just like throwing some, you know, just shooting the shit back and forth. And I forget what came up or what the subject was, but I remember thinking, this guy's nuts. He's not that bright. What was he? Was He hesitant or what was it?

Speaker 2:          02:00:10       Clumsy. Clumsy, like clumsiness thinking. I can't really tell you what it is. Then you'll know who the fuck I'm talking about. He's not a bad guy. My favorite author, he's good, but he, you know, look, Anderson Cooper is a, is another one that was considered by people. I've only read this, I don't know and I can't give you examples. He was crying. He was recognized by a lot of people who wrote about this afterwards as a pretty good journalist that got him to where he was to, but got them to be an anchor of NBC. He had, he was a credible journalist who did good work, who did, who wrote good articles and good did good investigation and that's why it was such a bummer for so many people buy a lot of other accounts. That's not true. Other is not true. There's other people that said that he was an asshole, that he was a pretentious.

Speaker 2:          02:00:52       I mean, who the fuck knows? Whenever something like this happens who sides, you're going to get bullshit on both directions, but all I know is when we don't really need those guys. We don't need someone that's a credible voice. I agree. We need information. That's what we need and it's almost worse when it comes from a personality, especially if we think that personality could potentially be manipulated. It's charismatic father figure that's reading you the new escalator. It's actually kind of, it's kind of creepy in a way, but a free honest and open press and knowing that you can trust the information you get say for it from the New York Times because they have a, they work very hard at making sure at least what that the stories or the information, not the stories of the slant but the information presented so, so for example, somebody gets shot a 12 year old gets, we know that's true.

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       We're not going to say they're making that up. There has to be a certain amount of non cynical trust in a society where we just give people the benefit of the job. You can't go through life believing that CNN and dateline is the best source of news and they have no hidden motivated. Absolutely. They certainly do. But here's the other part of the problem. The format is incredibly flawed and antiquated. Yeah. The format of getting the entire world's news in an hour with 18 minutes of commercials is ridiculous. You can't get it that way, cause they're going to pick and choose the things that are exciting. It's an entertainment show about events. That's what it really is. Yeah. It's an entertaining show about events and that's why you have this asshole with a tie who speaks like your girlfriend's father. Like, oh, this fucking guy again.

Speaker 2:          02:02:23       You know what I mean? Like this is, this is who he is and he's the reason Kim Kardashian posting a selfie sign a deal for $100 million is the start of the news. That's the, if it bleeds, it leads. That's what they say. And there's no doubt that that political leanings by journalists bleed into the news. I mean, there's too much credit. It's a shit on. Assume they're does shitty way to get information. That's not how any of us should get information and they shouldn't have it anymore. It was important back in the day when they didn't have fucking reading, you know, and they would get on TV and nobody, I mean you'd read your newspaper in the morning and then the afternoon you would listen to the news or you would watch the news. It became on television. That's we are at war with Japan. What's his, you hear on the news, we're at war with Japan now.

Speaker 2:          02:03:05       You would get Twitter alerts like way before that shit would have, when you see rob Walter Cronkite back in the day, it was just very matter of fact, he got on and read the news. And one of the things, there's a famous story I think about the, the guy who was ran 60 minutes and he came in and he said, good news and bad news. Good news is got very high ratings last night. And bad news is we've got very high ratings last night and the news will never be the same. So in other words, we now have a lot of pressure to get ratings. And what does that mean sensationalize things? What does that mean? Focus on what's wrong, not what's right for fear. It's an input. It's a disproportionate in a non and non accurate view of the world because by only focusing on these negative things and not focusing on the fucking hundreds of millions of positive things that are happening all the time, all over the world, you're getting this distorted version of reality that threatens people and makes people alert and uh, react to stress. You're reacting to danger. A sense of fear. I feel like isis lives next door and run and more importantly, I'm going to get a fucking lion killer. Let the guy fucking rant about Isis and Jesus Christ and you just can't stop. And Keller, he's trying, he's trying to do some comedy. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:04:21       says, no, you got this man can, are you guys going on about Isis in fucking Marina del Ray? You're like, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, but my, my uncle, no, I wasn't. I was going to say that. What, what I think that the damage done is that you don't get any real information. Like, like I was having a conversation, somebody who really knows the Middle East

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       and they were like, nobody ever talks about. The biggest problem with two things with first of all, the Middle East is the Sunni Shia schism. The idea that you start there, some we don't even know where to start with a debate. We start talking about Isis, we start talking about the problems that bother us and we don't actually really know where the source of the problem is. We don't know how it started because we're not, you don't get it from what you were saying, you don't get it from, we get them from CNN and dateline suppose does that you're not supposed to, you didn't, you know, it used to be you have to wait for the news to come out yet to get a newspaper and then you get alerted to the important stories in the radio or on the news, on the news, on television. We don't need that anymore.

Speaker 3:          02:05:13       It's just antiquated and it's dangerous because it gives you a version of the world. It's not entirely accurate. It's very slanted because that's what you're scared of. So that's what you're tuned into. So that's where they can sell advertising. Hey, we scared the fuck out of a hundred people. Did you see nightcrawler? Yes, it's fucking excellent. Excellent. And it's all about this. Nightcrawler is all about this. First of all, Jake Glue and hall is a bad motherfucker. How did he not win a, he should have won an award. Think awards are stupid. I agree. He's, he's just, he's just excellent. It's an excellent movie. It doesn't mainly really, really, really dope ass. A dodge challenger makes the hands right. It's not even starts balling. Yeah. What is that ball? And it gets red challenger with black. Get there faster. I love how he talks to his sidekick.

Speaker 3:          02:05:57       Yeah, it's an amazing, Jeremy. If don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't give it. Don't spoil it. Folks that are listening. Oh my bad. Goddamn a spoiler alert. And I see every movie shit, man. Tell him I go, don't tell me about the fights or whatever you've done. 14 seconds. That's all I'm going to say. It pisses me off when he misses the fight. So I text him all the results. He says, you know, that's part of your job is to be a pay attention to. I'm aware of that and when he doesn't see it, I'm like, fuck that noise. I'm aware. Tape taping a defensive stance because fucking Cobra for impact because I get mad. I'm like, Brennan, don't tell me anything. Work waterway to play. I don't want to play volleyball. I go, don't tell me anything. Cain Valasquez ends up winning. He punches him in the face.

Speaker 3:          02:06:44       Man, I got to teach you. You know, what are you doing? You're out there in the wild dude. My workouts are at night. A lot of times it's hard to just beach. Think about death. The Alexander Emily Yanko workout. Not The fight or what? What's the difference? Just a lot. A lot of back work and crime. A lot of packers, shit, ups and crimes. Is Crime just to cry? Oh man, that's hilarious. How about Brendan's apart? It's beautiful. It's got a God damn full head of hair. If I had that much hair, I do weird shit. You don't want a man because you know, I've been taking a break from training and I haven't grown my hair out since I was in. I Dunno man. So for me to grow it out, she can't have really hairstyle trained a ton. Putting Gel in your hair. Feel like you know dude, I've been a, I don't know. I know you got to, you had a neck injury for awhile. I've been getting this. Uh, this

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       dude does rolfing and he uses a, he's got this fucking crazy, it's like this metal piece that's wrapped in like a soft plastic or got thin sheet of plastic around it, you know, so it's like semi soft on the outside, but underneath it's iron or steel, whatever the fuck it is. This shit breaks up. Scar tissue. Woo. This shit hurts. Soggy. Okay, so now here east of he and sit through that. Oh, I had it done on my hands to get done once a month or once a week or gangster. Not Mom once a month. Once a week. Know what's weird is people be like, oh shop, your neck hurts and this is my fault. We'll have random people that got, let me see it and I'll just sit down and they start cracking in and this random girl was grabbing my neck was like your ribs out, your ribs out.

Speaker 2:          02:08:17       Oh I'm sitting there, her weight's on my shoulder. Push on my head. I'm thinking I don't know this woman. I let her do it. You can't do that. You can't. I know man, we know you know a lot about this stuff. What do we know about like when you, if my lower back hurts, is that a function of inflammation? Well here's the deal and you don't know until you get an Mri, you need to get an Mri. Okay. I got an MRI recently cause I wanted to get a look at my back, no exact what's going on and everything's cool. Just some disc degeneration, minor disc degeneration, a little bit of soreness and inflammation is really nothing to do for that. No, not much you can do. So it's all, it's all fine. Like it's fine to push myself, but you got to know that you're fine to push yourself.

Speaker 2:          02:08:52       Yeah. Badge if you don't you say that. But if you don't know, it's just guessing like people that have psychiatric. I'd be like, they keep going. Oh my sciatic nerve. Well, do you know what that is? That's a bulging disc that's pushing on your nerve. Like you're making it look like your nerve is acting weird. You know you're nervous being washed by your fucking, just the, the soft shit in between your bones in your spine is pushing into your fucking nerve. That's serious shit. And people that ignore that or try to work through it like you can fuck yourself up. I know three dudes that have had significant neck surgery because of impinged nerves where it was causing atrophy to their muscles. Three dudes, very close guys from my gym. I know one dude that can't, he can't do Jujitsu anymore. We can't, we can't roll.

Speaker 2:          02:09:36       Can't do it. It's a fine line though. Like a lot of guys, there'll be messed up and like, Nah, I'm not going to see a doctor. And then now you know the UFC insurance policy, I'm like, damn, my wrist hurts. I get an x ray. That was damn my nose hurts. I get an x ray, you should do that fucking professional fighter, man. The UFC must be like fucking shop man. What's wrong with him? He jammed his thumb, man. You're not the only one. A lot of dudes are doing that and they should. They should. That is a giant part of what you do for a living. I have awards. You got to know the years they sound, they're silly. That's silly. You can look this is what you like that that's antagonistic sort of relationship with people when they have injuries. Yeah. That's a very fucking tricky you think to beats me. It's weird though man, because you, you know like back in the day it's like, oh I want to be tough. So now like it's my own ego when I have to call my manager, but like dude, I, yeah, am I, I got to get my neck checked out. It takes usually three or four weeks for me to talk myself into getting the doctor cause it's like this ego thing, right? I want to be a bitch man. Like,

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       like, like metro was in town. He's like, you want to train? I really can't go real hard wrestling right now. I want to with him and Barnett, I just can't. And so I was like, Oh, I'm busy man. That's smart man would do to try to ignore pain. There's a lot of dudes, I try to ignore pain there. Their bodies, why not fallen apart? We had John Wayne par on and he was talking about Ramon Dekkers. Ramon Dekkers date got him to a point where they fused his fucking ankle to his shinbone cause he had broken, it's so many times just full power kicks. He would kick so fucking hard and smash into elbows and knees and shins and he shattered his ankle so many times from his right kick that they had a fuse it so he would hobble, when he walked new tape that fucker up and get in there and they told him, they were like, you can't kick with this and we're going to have to fucking amputate your leg if you break it again.

Speaker 1:          02:11:23       And he would wait a little while fighting a southpaw and say, you know what? Fuck it switched dances and just start attacking with me. Dude. Fumes, a bad motherfuckers fucking ankle didn't bend. He still, yeah, he passed away right at 43. Oh No. Died of a heart attack at 43. Oh boy. Riding a bike apparently. And he was one of the all time great dogs. Phenomenal. If you don't know who he is, resets a compromise. It gets in your artery. Ramon Dekkers woo. He was good. Oh Dude. Just the most average savage, so, so aggressive. And he was like, he was a Dutch guy, but the Dutch people were very big. Yes. Like the average height for a Dutch man is six feet tall. It's people in Europe. Yeah. The tallest people in Europe and a lot of big and he was little. So he, he had to be tough.

Speaker 1:          02:12:11       Uh, and he was one of the first guys to go over to Thailand and beat the ties and tie boxer. You think about how tough he is, your ankles fused to your fucking leg, man. Yeah. Oh yeah. Your foot, knee and your ankle, like all the way down is one piece. Yeah. That's not good. Don't use it. Definitely don't use it. And then gets in a fight and fuck. He's definitely a guy who doesn't know what to do with his time. Like he, he's just not going to quit this. Tell Him we might have to amputate your leg cause you've shattered your bones so many times. The whole thing is like you to be honest, it's not that it's gonna be like, Ooh man. It's Kinda how I feel about Madonna at 56. Sean her ass off like an old fighter who won't quit. Just take a look at this.

Speaker 1:          02:12:50       How dare you make that comparison. Sorry. No, he fucked the whole thing up with Eddie Murphy. Shrek thing. Yeah. But this might just be just sad. Madonna's an oddity at this point. I think so. When people go to see her, it's an oddity. She's a 60 year old woman in her underwear. I was dancing around with a bunch of gay guys following her everywhere she goes and hanging on her. Every word. Yeah. Yanked off stage the other day. Well, I know that, I don't know. I think fucking Brian Williams was me. What happened? Ah, she uh, that she was dancing the things was like yank the Cape off, but like God, her neck. Oh my God. Gangsters. Bitch. Right off this stage. Is there video of that? Oh yeah. Oh, we got to see them play it for us. Play it again. Jamie. She gets to cap. She'll be 80 Sean her body off.

Speaker 1:          02:13:30       Should you best that she fired whoever made that case was brought by her dead. Oh yeah, he's probably dead. He's probably Dutch. Probably beat him to death. He's remember Madonna beat someone to death with a hammer and they just, you see the body just scoop out the back door. It was like the 19th, the little hammers. It was the 1930s. Just had a carpenters hammer. Just fucking impaler. Oh Shit. Let me see that again one more time please. Oh, look at this bitch. Ah, oh. Oh my God. She's old dude. When you fall like that and you're old, you could break a hip champ. Oh my God. That's crazy. She handled that really well by the way. She fell really well. She really did. She could have got her that tailbone up. She has zero as she got her, got her a muscle on her ass.

Speaker 1:          02:14:19       I was filming this movie and Kevin James Zookeeper. Yes. Boston chasing scene. We had a bike chasing scene and I kept hitting the front brakes on the bike because the front brakes where my left hand, the back bakes for my right hand and I'm riding this bike and I'm hitting him with this thing and I hit the front bags and go flying over the handlebars. All the concrete like tumble into the grass. I did it like three times. So you're doing that. You did your own stock in other words? Yeah, I did all of it. One where a guy jumped meet a bike jump where it was a stunt man right where he had to, he had a ride down this hill and then hit this ramp and jump over this flight of stairs and land on the ground. And the, he did that. He was like a stunt jumper but all the other shit I did and they wanted to have a stunt guy do the fall like cause that's what would eventually happen was was he was supposed to jam his flag into my wheel and then I go flying and he takes off.

Speaker 1:          02:15:14       But I fell so spectacularly that they use my actual fall in the, in the actual movie body. And did, did you do a judo roll or what happened? I got to see, oh look at you. You're sick. I think I rolled in one of them and one of them maybe I fell a bunch of times. One of them. It was cool because I landed in the grass. Like I hit the curb and went flying. I got to see this reality. I can't believe I've been, Jane's a Good Dude, Huh? He's a very good dude. He was very, very kind. The great guy, dude. How about stuntmen? They're fucking crazy man. Stunt men in a crazy, I have people tell me all the time, I'd probably say once a week, dude, you should get into some stunt were no fucking cool. That's easy. That's how boss hurt his neck.

Speaker 1:          02:15:51       It was one of the things I was going to get to his boss when he was on, I think sons of anarchy. Yep. One of those shows, he did a stunt and he's doing his own stunt work and they landed them on his head and bang, it just fucked his neck up. And then he had to get his discs fuse. Didn't you have a friend who does stonework? And he like was in a coma for grid, can't taste food anymore. You got to hit the back of his head and uh, lost his sense of taste and smell and it's never come back. And his testosterone, my, so we had to go on. But, um, I, I was doing, I was doing the Goldbergs and this girl had to fall down on her, just fall on her back. And I thought, and I said, she was a girl and, and I,

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       and I, and it was on a linoleum floor, like a real cafeteria floor. And I said, how are you going to do that? And she goes, just fall. And I said, I know, but then she just boom, just hit, hit, hit, hit it five times. No, she was a stunt woman five times and I said, I said, I said, how are you doing? She goes, I'll be sorta mall. She was falling. I remember when I did death valley and I had a judo flip, this giant guy, Joe or na's, this guy Joe or Knaus who is a, well this, this was crazy. It's got [inaudible] who's a giant stunt man on death valley and I'm awesome. Works all the time. Just pig, big judo guy. And He, we had this desk like this uh, thing and I, he's a vampire. He jumps on me and I had to flip them over and I thought it was going to break away furniture.

Speaker 3:          02:17:10       It really wasn't breakaway furniture. It was as hard as it gets and I just would throw him and he would flip over me and throw him slip and fall on his back. He did it over and over and just, you know, they get paid well to do that. They get paid well, not well, not well enough. I would never do. It depends on what you have to do. I mean, if you have to do something like that is definitely not well enough. Oftentimes they were padding and they do their best, but look, they're taking bumps no matter what. And they're, their head's getting jostled around and dragged by a horse they say is the most dangerous resolute. Fuck that. And they have to do that for some fucking movies, man. There's not much you can do about it. You get dragged by a horse, you, you, you got to do it very specifically and you gotta be really careful because they can't really stop the horse.

Speaker 3:          02:17:51       They've got to be, how do you control the Horse? You control it with another horse, but you got to let that horse go for a while and they spooked the horse. The horse is trained to run and you get dragged and that is, they consider the most dangerous. How about car shit? Well, they're doing car chases and shit like fucking hangover to listen to. Someone was in a movie. Oh Jay Quillen hall. They were saying that that fucking movie there was not CGI when they did those car accidents and that movie. All the car accidents in nightcrawler. I'm pretty sure it was him. See, please Google that. So it wasn't that he was in too much crazy. What about the fucking high speed chase? I don't want to say anything more. I will say that the one time there's some serious shit enough so that you like get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 3:          02:18:32       Like this is real. This is not CGI. Apparently that was one of the things that the director wanted to do. I'm pretty sure that's the case. And you know people clown and Tom Cruise for kind of being a sissy, but he did all his own stunts and mission impossible. I heard when he hung from that building, that's pretty gang. He does his own driving stunts too. Does running and, and he's a powerful guy. Whatever the fuck that movie was that he did with Cameron Diaz, he had some crazy movie with whether, Oh, I like that movie and if days or what it was, no, no, no, no, no. That's a great, that's a great movie to know. The edge of tomorrow. That's very underrated. Good movie. That's a movie that almost suffers from him being too wacky. I agree ma'am. As a beast of a movie. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:19:10       Like if that movie was like someone else, like will Smith, will Smith's a little wacky to [inaudible] movie? Yeah. If you, if like, who would have been, who would like Tom Cruise killed it and that movie, by the way, edge of tomorrow. He kills so good. Oh yeah. But if someone else did an equal job of killing it, like okay, here's one Travolta Daniel Day, Lewis of Daniel Day Lewis was, he's too serious though for a fucking year. Saifai crazy movie. That was a realistic Scifi movie that wasn't, you know what I mean? It wasn't like so stupid that you put, you put that heart throb from Thorin there that things he knew well that boys up a what man? Tom Cruise. I did a reading with him and I took his body and I took, I spent a good four hours, Tom Cruise [inaudible] I spent a good four hours with him. Well, he'll tell you he was there.

Speaker 3:          02:19:58       We talk. How tiny is he? He's not, he's not as tall as I am, but he's very stout. He's got wide center of gravity, thick hips, fixed shoulders, sloped shoulders as you asked. I would make out with them, make out with them while if all went down, if you were like canopy, well, under a canopy, you've got to push back. Guys made a corner, put me in a corner, don't you? And you were playing a gay lover and a movie, but in the movie you don't ever make out. Right. But he wants to make out with you just one time, just like pretend that this way we're going to look and where together we're gay lovers. Well, this is our movie. I, after I did the rating, I see him six months later at this big Hoity toity party. I talked to him for a good hour, maybe hour and a half to wake up over the past 10 I remember saying to myself, five minutes, even an hour and a half brokers like, oh fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:20:48       Half an hour and a half by himself. Just, we talked about one on one for an hour to have killed Americans for an hour and a half. Oh, I kept it. I kept him though. You ain't lying a little bit though. I got an, I got a witness. Jeremy Pivot. You tell him. Anyway, he's got a funny story about it. It doesn't matter, but we're sitting there talking for 15 minutes and he and I remember looking at him going and he was complimenting me on my job. I did it in the reading and Jeremy was, he said, he said, you did a good job 13 times. I said, 13 he goes, yes. I said, good. So we talked for a long time. They've talked about kids, everything else. And I remember thinking to myself, this is so lame. And I was a grown man and I remember thinking myself, I'll go, I just really want to be his friend.

Speaker 3:          02:21:30       I hope. He says, let's hang out again. I remember saying, I would love to just, I was so star struck and I really liked him and he was so nice and I figured, you know what's, what happens when you give them a list kind of friends now I kind of know him kind of, Eh, that didn't happen. And I remember I said, no, I was going to happen. I looked at my house, I go, I know I, this is what I said to him. I go, so how you been? What's it like just to be the king? Is it just generally boring or a lot of fun? He just looked at him and then it's a, you know, it is what it is. And, and we started talking. I tried to make them laugh and I did. I've seen him in person at Tom Cruise. He was the first time I've ever been like, I was at this party.

Speaker 3:          02:22:02       Everyone was there, athletes and I was going to the bathroom. I was going to expect any him and I saw much when it first time everyone. Oh Shit. Tom Cruise and he was tiny, tiny like five, six, uh, yeah, five. Yeah. Five six one 60 yeah. Tiny I think thicker than one 60 I think I get five days, but then again, he's in shoes. Probably might have some weird shoes probably, but he's thick. He's thick. He's got a fan. I'm a fan man. Run the a fan. He's got a deck on them. Kids get it. We did take a piss together. What about us? How long pice together? You didn't look at his dick. I was at the urinal right next to him. We were talking about he took a long pice together. What the fuck does that mean? We talked about Dan cables run. How long you're pissing.

Speaker 3:          02:22:46       We've talked about Dan Gables wrestling camp cause I went to, Dan gave us intensive wrestling camp in Iowa. My between my junior and senior year of high school and he said he would have loved to have but he couldn't afford it. We are holding our dicks and I remember, I remember thinking I'm not pissing with Tom Cruise. I pissed with Dennis Miller ones. That's not bad. That's my story. Doesn't mean somewhere like NBC or something like that. Hey Joe, you got a hit on your hands there? It was like fear factor first got on the air. I'm like, Oh shit, I'm pissing right next to desk Miller. I wanted to ask him, man, what's it was all his fucking George Bush shit. You're buddies with George Bush. I didn't have the balls. No, I'm wanting to ask him. That's when it became George Bushes Buddy. Is there anyone now that would startle you or make you star struck a lot of people.

Speaker 3:          02:23:26       Really? For sure. Yeah, I got you. I got weirded out when I met Anthony Bordain. There was a few years back, but I got weird about all the UFC is now. A lot of them are Trans Jiu Jitsu every day. Wow. He trains you just to every day. He does two hour classes every day. He does an hour of classes all over the place. Even when he's on the road, he was doing wrong. He was rolling in Budapest, Hungary. I'm a big fan of a picture of him on Twitter with his fucking white belt and a geeky showing up at this fucking Jiujitsu pleased to Carlson Gracie's place. Told me he was doing all top game. He said he was shitting how bone fragments. God Damn. He said they all have old school. Carlson Gracie top game. Oh my God. I said I'm shitting out bone fragments and you gave me so, so you're a little star struck the who would you be starstruck with free.

Speaker 3:          02:24:11       I got starstruck when I met Arnold Schwarzenegger and he knew who I was. Oh you did? Nice to meet you. So, oh, I know. I was like, what's up dude? I got that camera. Very good job. I was like UFC fan. He's a UFC fan. Arnold. I mean, yeah, it was a big one. That was a big one. Um, if I met Clint Eastwood, even though I think he's a silly bitch, you know that thing he did with the Obama when he's talking down to them in a chair, it's still Clint Eastwood. I mean, he's a crazy old man now. Kind of Clint Eastwood. He's give him his props. Rog Josie Wales. Great movies period. It's on pumps and much of our live in boy o high plains drifter. Come on. So I gotta be honest with you guys. I'm a lot younger than the clinics was not that big of a dance hall dude.

Speaker 3:          02:24:54       It's a shame if you're a family dollar million dollar baby. Unforgiven gypsy the unforgiven. No, I didn't do the good, the bad, the ugly. It just goes on and on. Then you guys know he was before our time. Man Clean. She's old as fuck, dude. Don't try to put it as he's older. His Clark Tori. You guys dirty Harry. When we were kids, when we were like little kids every which way was loose every which way, but loose was the big enemies, which meant that he was already so old. He wasn't doing the cowboy movies anymore. He was like this old bare knuckle boxer too. Back in those days. Oh my God. Amy Puts set. His girlfriend was in every movie here. This chick Sandra Lockhart was, she has with the bond, every fucking movie he did. Every movie he did dirty shit. That was his girlfriend. Motherfucker had this one was in the, they put her in every movie.

Speaker 3:          02:25:43       Every movie was him and his girlfriend until they broke up and when they broke up, like part of their breakup was that he had to get her some sort of a development deal and then she sued for, she sued him because she said that like allegedly I should say this is all allegedly I'm reading this online. It could be all be bullshit, but she thought that he was blocking her movies from being made dad. It was like it was an ugly composes his own music. All the jazz and there's all the scores. Sure, sure he does. He composes in and now what's the movie? A high plains drifter. That's his, that's his score. Have you seen shortly, have you seen interviews with him? Why? He's very old now. I don't, that's what I'm saying. He did American sniper. That's what they say or was the onset and they just know he directed it.

Speaker 3:          02:26:26       You know he's not, he's not so old that he can't do that. That's what he's not all up in there. Like frick you think he's all you American, right. My mind. Your p's and q's about claims would do me a favor. What? Chris cow motherfucker. I think he lied. Hold on. Hold on a second. It's not hating on someone. It's tell the truth. It's hating on the rest of the population to pretend that truth doesn't exist and to not take those facts into consideration when you're discussing a story. I can't say, hey, hit that, but he's the greatest American sniper ever, ever. Whether he's lying or not. That's true. Those are facts. What do you know about that? I know what America tells me. What do you know about Clint Eastwood directed American sniper? What do you know about it? For sure it's a movie. That's what they tell and it's a good movie according to some pizza.

Speaker 3:          02:27:16       I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it. You want me to tell you what happens? Ours for your fucking hated it. I have a video of Ari Shaffir and Thompson girl arguing. Thompson Gara says it's amazing and Ari Shaffir says retarded. I listened to it on your show. Hate on it. It's fucking crazy. Well, Teesha join us. If what he said was true. Does he not have a point? Was there a rubber baby that was like obviously a rubber baby? Not really. Not really. I thought it was a real baby. Not really. It was a real baby. Jamie has something to say to them. I don't, I don't go to the movies and be like, God damn, that baby looks fake. This is ridiculous. Clint Eastwood come on. That is splitting hairs. Well, that's just one thing. I mean are you had a boost in my worries when I go to the movies.

Speaker 3:          02:27:57       The famous baby, the big baby. Come on, get the fake baby. That looks real. Hold on. We'll see. You just saw it for a brief second. If you're staring at the baby. Picture the fake baby right now. It looks like a baby. I'm cool with it. It seems fine. It seems fine. I'm not really paying attention to it. Okay. That was it. And your boy, he's hating on it. No, there's more apparently some real fake baby shit going on later. Oh, here it goes. Okay. That's fake as fuck Louis Thumb. Oh God. Mark is. Fuck it does look, you don't drastic Parkman like that. T rex, man. I'll tell you why they think you're being dishonest. You don't think it's ridiculous looking at his thumb moving show that the sat. No, it's not even. That's a joke. That's someone being silly. They're joking around because it's a fucking rubber baby.

Speaker 3:          02:28:49       Oh, come on. The baby can only work a certain amount of hours and they got union rules, so it's a bad movie because that baby's face. I had to work with babies. It's a pain in the ass. Listen, I don't think it's a bad movie because I don't think it's a bad movie cause I didn't see it, but I definitely don't think that just look, you got to, I don't want to pay attention to the baby, but apparently the baby was only one issue, that's for sure. Just look terrible. I didn't see the movie movie was implausible was ridiculous. I was just disappointed that I didn't see it at that, that he, he, he lied a lot about certain things and I think that's a bump. Fuck. He still is the greatest American sniper ever. Okay. That's a weird thing to say though. Like you don't give a fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:29:30       So you, you were not willing to overlook Anderson Silva a pass on doing steroids. Interesting. It's interesting and Brian Willing to pass though. Yeah, that's true. You're very inconsistent that we've gone with the wind. Just kind of like a blind tire career blind patriotism to that. Right? Like you recognize that he's a greatest American sniper, so all the other stuff you just don't want to talk about. No, I'll talk about it. But him being a great American sniper is the biggest thing that that should Trump all of it. Yeah. He lied. He didn't take out people, uh, during that trip we say Katrina. Yeah. Yeah. He didn't do that. He didn't beat up Jesse Ventura. Yeah, I know. Cool man. But just killed 160 terrorist. Yeah, I'm cool man. I'm gonna overlook some of that shit. You're still a great American and they're both true. It is true.

Speaker 3:          02:30:22       I don't, I don't know what's true. Obviously I'm talking about interviews and people's books and all this different shit. I didn't really, unless we were there, we really don't know what the fuck actually happened. But they can both be true. Like I've met people that were movie stars that were also tremendous wires. I mean, I don't want to name names with the dude was a movie star and he's a tremendous liar. Just makes up stories about all kinds of things and you would never believe you like this stuff. You know, it's just a complete fabrication. Things that never happened to him and the guy's worth millions and millions of dollars. But one thing we do know is he was a navy seal and he was a sniper who killed a lot of people for, for America. He risked his life for America. Hold on. So he's okay with, hold on, hold on. For sure. Relaxed. He had, he went to buds training. Yes, he became a navy seal. Very difficult to do and he's really good at killing people. Uh, that's a skill set as a sniper that I'm sure it takes a lot of things I don't know about. I don't think that that necessarily means, and I'm sorry to say this and that, that means he's a good guy. I don't

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       think that necessarily means that girls aren't getting, it doesn't mean he gets a pass for lying. Uh, and direct a making up stories about not only killing looters, New Orleans who are stealing stuff, which is already illegal and considered murder under the laws of this land. But he didn't do it so well, but that's what he was saying he was doing, which is very strange. I haven't read the book so I don't want to talk too much and I haven't seen the book or the movie. All you do is no his name. Let me play devil's advocate here. Just as a, as a person who like, let me just be completely objective ticket, a wild shot at this. Now this might not be the case, so I'm just put that out there in the advanced would if he decided to tell all these tall tales because the book would be better and he wanted to sell a book and make a lot of money selling a book and he didn't understand the kind of media storm and that these checks, these are these stories going to be checked and double checked.

Speaker 2:          02:32:09       And when he decided to do was add a bunch of fabricated shit to a real story because you know, first of all he's probably psychologically damaged from shooting a hundred and fucking 60 people. Like I don't think you'd get away from that for free. I don't think you'd go to war. And I don't think anybody rides for free anymore. I think you do. You take in a lot of psychological damage. Everybody says that. So it could possibly be that the guy just said all that shit because he wanted to sell books. It's possible. And is that crazy? Does that make him a bad guy? Because I don't know. It was government's not paying them very well. Right. Good point. He's not making much money, so he fabricates his stories. His book is a New York Times bestseller. He gets all this money. Is that, that's the deal.

Speaker 2:          02:32:49       It's all possible. All I'm trying to say is this. I'm not, I don't know Chris Kyle. I didn't, I don't know anything about the guy. I don't know if he's a bad guy, a good guy. I, I'm, I tend to be pretty patriotic, so usually, yeah, so usually he gets, he gets, he gets a lot of leeway with me. When you're a soldier and you went to Iraq and you do all that stuff. Yes. For me, that's how I am, but I do think that I still have to at least like what Joe was saying, when you found out that you made up these stories, that's kind of a bummer for me. It's just disappointing that he did lie about something like, I don't give a shit trying to sell blue for whatever reason. It could very well have been that he was trying to sell books and he could also very well be that we were talking before.

Speaker 2:          02:33:28       Maybe we need to understand a little bit better since none of us went to war. What kind of mental toll that takes on a person and that you kind of shouldn't expect them to be completely fine with everything when they come back and some of them are going to make shit up and maybe they're making shit up because reality is so fucking crazy that they don't want to deal with it anymore. Or maybe so they just, he thinks it's real. Maybe he maybe had a situation where he was in New Orleans and you thought about shooting didn't happen, but he goes to war. Something happens like, yeah, well it's good for the book. Right? And by the no one could understand what the fuck that guy's life was like except for him. And it's not even given him an excuse. What we're saying is we're just looking at the possibilities, right? Like instead of saying, Hey, this is a guy that was full of shit, he lied about that

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       and he's a bad person. This is a guy that was forced to do some anti human shit for the government. People are complicated. And you and I have talked about this. People are complicated. A lot of people, we know certain people that are high profile people that get criticized a lot and they're hated on and you know them pretty intimately and it's like, yes, they've done some things. There are also complicated people. They also do incredibly good things for people that nobody knows about. So there's, there's no question that people generally are not black and white. They have a bad side. They have a good side. And I know I do. I know I do. I know I have a lot about, I haven't, I know a lot of things about myself. I'm not that proud of. So if this is black and white, this is very black and white.

Speaker 3:          02:34:57       If you didn't like the film, American sniper hero, fucking terrorist diseases, we should fear is a Jew. That's what they should do. They should. This is how they should check. If you're a terrorist. We've uh, been, did you like American sniper? No. Go to the right. Did you like American sniper? Yes. Go to the lab is when you go to the right though. You don't get on the plane. Dammit. Brennan arch fear would chew you up if you guys had this conversation. He gets sun, so anchoring it sunny. I get an eerie tune in to hear him ranting with the Thompson [inaudible]. It's hilarious. The two of them together. I got to eventually put this online, but they get so fucking in each other's face about it. They're like yelling like at something like really important to talk about. I do think it's, it's, it's important to be charitable about just how complicated human beings are. Yes. It doesn't mean you don't call somebody out.

Speaker 6:          02:35:51       Just so contrived at all. The fact that they didn't show him getting shot was actually a good choice and then at the end of like he was killed that day and writing,

Speaker 3:          02:36:07       oh, we play the whole thing. I'll put it on. I'll put the whole thing in Boston winters communist, they big go. They go at it for like 10 minutes. He was mad that at the end they don't show him getting killed is mad about everything. You thought it sucked. He brought a bunch of people from his Twitter feed to go to the movie and heckle and they all went, they filled the audience, the the entire audience already best friends. I would've got a recipe like UFC fighter beats the shit out of Bahrain. His friends during the Mexican side, not the time to get arrested. This is not for you. Don't do that man. Beat up a bunch of chairs. Coffee forever, son, Chris Calvert. Hey man, terrorists. I can be swayed. When did you see the movie? I did and I haven't read the book or anything.

Speaker 3:          02:36:49       He knows nothing. No bad, no nothing. I only read. All I read is that the, I looked at all the stuff online and I was like, wow, that's interesting. I haven't read it. I don't know. I'm, that's incredible. So swimming, pinning on anything. When someone has killed that many people for the government, they give him a green light to kill that many people and to kill 160 people like the idea of like telling a lie about something. It's like really no big deal. Well that guy killing 160 people doing all these tours, you know in war should be, should

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       get $1 million from the US government for the rest of his life. He should be financially set for the rest of his life. Yeah, no kidding. Right? Like how much, how much do they actually get when they retire? My Buddy Buddy's Delta force was delta force and he said that I heard, and I don't want to say online because I mean it's so pitiful. It's called hazardous duty pay. You don't make any money, you, you, you don't have enough to live. And if you are, if you go to a divorce, half of that money goes to your wife and your personal life, your fuck cause their divorce rate's like 96% it's not cool man. They should definitely get more money and stress. The same with cops. Stress that's tress is insane. It's, it's, it's like, it's an unprecedented level of success of stress. It's so hard to deal with.

Speaker 1:          02:37:54       It's also really hard when you're a sniper, you're, I don't know this, but I do know that a combatant can be even a child running munitions to a mortar, and if that child is doing that or a guy's looking at you with, with binoculars and trying to get a beat on your position, you take them out. That's hard. That's hard for a soldier who gets command. Take that guy out. Should that kid shoot that woman because she happens to be San Francisco. The enemy, if you watch the movie, it's sucks. Word hard is not even a, it's not a good enough word. No, it's not that. It's hard. It's almost impossible. It's almost impossible to reset from that and be a normal person without some help. I'm sure that's something go from doing that to fucking walking through radio shack with your wife. What the hell?

Speaker 1:          02:38:33       That's why you know all these guys coming back from war I, you know, that's one way to make America a little bit more polite and running into a bunch of people that just got back from killing a bunch of other people. Like, you know, people have a different attitude when you've been to a war is a different mentality and we have to respect that and I think we have to consider that that's an important as a culture, as a society that sort of wants to gloss over war and wants to glorify it and make it out to be this all this John Wayne Shit, we have to look at what the fuck is really happened. These people psychologically absolute same and the same thing with cops. Everybody wants to shit on cops because cops do occasionally do they do bad things and for you that have been done wrong by these cops, they couldn't handle that job.

Speaker 1:          02:39:14       I 100% feel for you. I 100% feel for it. I feel bad. I think we also have to consider the fact that being a cop is insane job. Some people beat calm fucking insurance salesman. Some people sell cars, some people become artists. Some people would come cops and you're out there in your fucking pulling up to pulling sideways a guy shooting a rifle out of a fucking window and taking people out. You've got to figure out how to sneak into the building. He called the Swat team. You're hiding behind your car here in fucking bullets, bouncing off the street. Cops have to deal with some issues getting shot at. So I'm going to have much experience. And you know how few of them know how to fight. That was the thing that always shocked me when I would train with guys who had been police officers and they didn't know how to fight. I'm like this is insane. Like you don't, you don't know any Jujitsu. You know nothing. Like if you get into scrambled with somebody, what do you do? Do you know how to get it? Like they don't know anything. Yeah, they freak out. You could sign up for being a cop, you could be a cop and you

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       have to just be in reasonable shape and not completely insane. That's it. Yeah. And then they get in trouble cause they get put in these lists. I'm not defend all cops. Some cops are scumbags. I get that. But in general they're good people and they get put in these situations. Why do you think in general, all people are good people. I agree, but then you get put in these situation where they have no experience. They don't know if this kid's going to shoot her in us, so like, Dang my life, his they shoot, and then there's this big uproar. It's similar to what we were talking about earlier with referees. Referee's make a mistake, you're making a mistake and a guy's going to take some fucking punishment because of that mistake. You're not designed to handle those high pressure situations or you're not qualified because you don't understand martial arts or you're just not good at your job, but for whatever reason, not focused, whatever the fuck it is, it makes you fuck up.

Speaker 2:          02:40:55       But if you fuck up as a referee, it's way worse than if Bruce Buffer fucks up as an announcer at Bruce buffer mispronounces Brian Cave. You know, you're like, Oh God, my name. It's not that bad. You know what I'm saying? If a cop fucks up, someone gets shot and dies or he gets shot and dies or he sees someone gets shot and died, that he could've prevented. All that stuff is too much for people to tough just to manage and to have that go on day after day. What do you have to look forward to when you're 25 they give you a watch. What do you look at? All the friends that you've had along the way that a blown their brains out or drank themselves to death or we'll fill in the blank, done all kinds of crazy shit. My, my buddy, my buddy was a swat team sergeant and he said he knew he had to get out when he was sitting down next to a body that they had shot and the corners are doing all their vests and he started eating a sandwich and didn't occur to him.

Speaker 2:          02:41:45       And he was like, I'm sitting right next to our body and I'm this, not this, not phased I, I've been so I become so numb and the view, my job, the view, and cops too, it's not like, you know most Americans and they're like, oh hell, he had cops man. Sweet. Most than when they drive by. Most people, especially the ones I hang out with, they're like, no, fuck, come. Americans don't want tough, hard, long Americans always have a problem. And it was an interesting article that I put up the other day that again, I don't know if it's true, but it was that this private, this town in Texas hired a private security firm and crime dropped by 61% and that with no financial incentive for there to be crime because they were just compensated for their job, for what they do for the hours on the job, they found less crime.

Speaker 2:          02:42:28       They also patrolled areas that had the most crime instead of just arbitrarily deciding where people went based on whatever the fuck it was that they had decided on before. They targeted it like very tactically and they cut back on crime by 61% and it costs less money. I'm trying, I'm confused. So they hired a private security. They have a fire. The cops in 2012 right? They fired the cops. They said this police force is retarded. This government police force sucks. We're going to hire, we're going to hire our own security force. We're going to vote to do this. So they decided to do this. They hired a security firm to become cops. And because these guys don't have the incentive to write tickets because they're not getting, it actually costs less. It costs them less. It cost them less and there's less crime. They're not getting as much revenue from it, but they're also not arresting people for fucking nothing.

Speaker 2:          02:43:14       So the P, it's gonna adjust the attitude of the people that live in the city. They're not going to be upset at cops all the time because they're not thinking to think that cops had just trying to pull people aside because they have, you know, they have criteria they have to meet, they have quotas. They have to make, which is they did the same thing with that. They did the same thing with road signs. Jamie, see if you could pull that article up cause it's on my, it's on my Twitter feed is, it's pretty fucking interesting. Yeah. There was an intersection in Holland. It's really, really busy and the guy took all the, all the road signs out and cause there were a lot of accidents said watch this. I'm going to take all the all road signs out and people figured it out on their own and he does this experiment where he walks, he puts his hands behind his back and walks backward into the busiest intersection and of course never gets hit because people figure out how to navigate that crazy space on their own.

Speaker 2:          02:43:57       For sure. That guy's going to get hit for sure. I was there, said the best story team, 61% seal security solutions. They hired a bunch of fucking people that were former seals and shit. Oh well. And they gave him a job. Shit of course it makes sense. It's fucking guys have experience. Look at that high stress situation. Reduce crime by 61% in just 20 months, you know, and also then you don't get to deal with the militarization of the fucking legit shit. Yeah. This is legit. Just written up by the operation. The seals, I dunno. I'm just reading what I'm reading online. I've done very little actual research out in the field. I didn't take any plane trips down there when it on the ground. When you prioritize and gravitize an area that the solution goes when we privatized and area, that tends to be policed better a lot of times then if the government wants, but now this is where fucking some Alex Jones shit comes up.

Speaker 2:          02:44:49       This is what you want, America, you want former military garden. Your straights holding a gun to your children's head. And who do you think they, who do they listen to when the shit hits the fan? Fema. Fema. God dammit. I got plastic coffins out there in the field. I've seen it with my own eyes. You this. We have a guy with his babies. We support our troops by hiring many employees. I served our country. Dude, I'm not mad at this at all. Sound bad. It's, look, if it works, I think that there's a lot of things that they do better when you take out bureaucracy, when you privatize that, when you offer them an incentive to be successful and when they have the support of the community because it can, community actually likes them. Yeah, for sure. For sure. They live in the community too.

Speaker 2:          02:45:30       Those are fucking sloppy. Overweight, out of shape curves for sure. Three out of shape. Yoked up. Roy It up, dude. Yeah, I want three. Ronnie Coleman's just Jack. Jack doing shit. Yeah. I would go like more of a thinner, but Ian Freeman in the machine with you man. Damn, I like that. They have dogs. I like those big canines. They can, they can smell out anything. Yeah, it's a good idea. Use Canine. You look at the a bomb detection, drug, drug detection. Look points dropped. The drug detection. All right, let's let that slide. But the shine. But I think that, uh, look, I think there's a lot of things that can be taken care of better by private, by the private sector. Look, that's what you see with education. Yup. I mean, you get a way better public, private, every education in most schools, uh, you know, will you deal with um, really high level private schools?

Speaker 2:          02:46:15       They're going to have a better education than the best public schools. That's just not an insurance incentive. This man, it's about incentives and the teachers are more qualified, the private schools, right. And a lot of day and paid more. It's a lot of times there's some really good public schools out there, don't get me wrong, but if you had to look at them all per capita, like what's going to be the most formal education? What's going to be like the most comprehensive education? There's a lot of people that have a lot of money to take their kids to private schools because they think that their kids are going to get a better education. It's college too. You're looking at private universities, man, it was the beast. I mean, the good thing about universities is that people can get scholarships if they prove, you know, academically that they're superior, that they're excellent athletically or athletically.

Speaker 2:          02:46:51       Those are good things too. They get an opportunity, but you know, privatizing shit though. That's the thing that I have that guy on the podcast fuck is his name, Peter, the fucking Peter Schiff, very, you know, financial genius. And he was saying one of the big problems with colleges, the reason why it costs so much is because it's all subsidized by the government. And because it's subsidized, he's fucking loans and these ridiculous interest rates and nobody gets roped into these incredible payment that they get stuck with. You get saddled up in debt before you even get out of school. You get at school, you already oh fuck. Tons of money. You also have to have, the good thing about privatization is you can innovate according to your circumstances. A lot of times when you have top down, you know a bureaucracy telling you what to do regardless, it's hard to innovate.

Speaker 2:          02:47:34       It's hard to move if you see with huge corporations versus smaller companies, you've got to be able to change with the times. And where I'm torn though, man, I think every kid deserves a private style. Education. Every deserves it. I know it doesn't sucks, but I think that's where the problem is. I think every kid deserves the best possible education, but we said like the best way to make America great. Everyone's like, let's make America great. What's guard our borders and keep our criminals now this is the best way. Make less losers, less loser. Put Shit tons of money on community programs and education and counseling and try to help people that are in bad situations. People that got a Shitty, you know, that's been societies. You know, it's been society's problem from day wise always. What do you do with the people that, that that not losers as his and you're a loser, but the losers in society that people don't get a piece of the pie.

Speaker 2:          02:48:19       That's always been the issue. There's no issue at the Middle East. We're never going to solve their biggest issue with the Middle East. You've got a group of people who have no young men, angry. Young men know where to place their energy and you want it. You want to go through the list of wipe fine. It's just, it's essentially governments that are not representative, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. It's a major problem. What do you do about it? What do you do about it? I think what you do about it, if I, if I'm obviously not a fucking financial planner, but if I was, if I had a look at the country like far as allocation of resources with tax dollars and you know, how much money do we have? What do we spend it on? I would say let's triple, quadruple even more the amount of money that goes into education and anybody wants to go to college, she'd be able to go to college. The idea that you get go to go to college and get saddled, and it sounds contradictory from what I said earlier, because the best schools, a lot of them are private today, but still,

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       I still think that the public education should be so much better than it is now and being a teacher should be worth so much more. It should be like a, a very prestigious position that's difficult to get initiated with a lot of money. You may not need me to my teacher. What about a really good one? What about a really good teacher teaches you about physiology, about explosive, fast twitch muscle fibers that shows you how to get better at the one that teaches you like kickball and fuck. Why do we have to have that though? Why can't awesome, but why can't you have that kind of shit where you have a little kickball game with kids, but you also explained to them this is what's going on when you're getting tired, this is what's going. This is the dog you eat has a different effect on the way your body performs.

Speaker 3:          02:49:45       A lot of it doesn't take money, but sometimes it takes a change in approach. Give him some fucking money they've given. She's out there. They get paid 50 cents an hour has to be a standard reality. Reality is happiest standard. You can't understand every dumb ass school. A private school. It's not easy to be a doctor, right? It's fucking really hard. It's really hard. You got to go to school. A lot of schooling, a lot of fucking education, a lot of education. You gotta it's difficult. Most people fall out. They don't, they don't hack through it. Big Committee like that to be your teacher, it really should. Finland, Finland, Finland has probably the most, but like according to the lot of ratings, the best school system, they don't test. They, I think they have one test here. The teachers are responsible to a large degree in making their own curriculum.

Speaker 3:          02:50:28       They don't have this core curriculum. Everybody has to learn the same thing. But I have some good teachers, man. And, and they, and Matt, more importantly, they pay their teachers and their teachers have a great deal of esteem in the society. And Finland school system is always outperforming almost every other country. And when I had the guy on who wrote this thing called Finnish lessons, a book, he said, I don't even like talking about rankings because that's already the wrong way to look at it. And the problem with testing is that that's what happens is you, instead of focusing on understanding, and the other really, really interesting thing, as he said, we've focused on teaching people how to solve problems as a group. Because if you think about it, you do the a lot of that when you work in a corporate function test at some point.

Speaker 3:          02:51:06       Because if the teachers for, let's say they're teaching for a year, it's like, well let's see if these kids learned anything. Learning to anything. You have to test it. You learn, well actually they do because they have to rely on each other to solve problems and we'll give them a problem and then they'll kind of let them solve that problem and they try to mimic as closely as they can. The real life situations and problems that they're going to come across when they are. For example, working for a company like Toyota or no care, like just that. I don't like that, that new age teaching men. Why it's not new age, it's more practically, I think it's more practical. I think you still have to have history. They have to learn all that they do and they do have testing but not nearly as much. Oh, so they do have some, they have they, I think they have two tests.

Speaker 3:          02:51:45       He said no testing for the most part they don't. But they had the ask Brian Cowen the way he talks. Yeah, no, literally no test. And he said they ended up tents, just afraid of shit. I said they have one test a year, maybe two tests here. Well, there's a lot of people that do think that you shouldn't have that. That shouldn't be your incentive to get a high score to absorb knowledge and then it becomes confusing. People say, well, the becomes a competitive thing like a, my daughter got a 98 and my daughter got a 100 sorry. I bet you forgot your daughter's man. You need competition like sports too. It's like, you know, you can't play tag anymore. Can't play dodge ball anymore. They don't want losers in certain games. My daughter played softball and no one lost. That's where I'm like, I watched people.

Speaker 3:          02:52:23       No noise man. How come? No one lost but there were four and they're barely hitting the ball. I'm the dad keeping score. No one. Nothing. That's real life to nothing, Janine. You're out. Get the fuck. You only get three swings. Ain't home learned that losing's. Okay, because that's how you try harder. Because it feels bad to lose like no one wants their kid to feel bad. Everybody won except teared. You're preparing them for life. That's that Calabasas Shit, man. It's not Calabasas. Calabasas going on out here, going out across the country. Fox, the little kids, the way to shoot live underwater Colorado. You struck out and you struck out and got made fun of. What's it Gallagher Bassett's. I'll bet. I bet there's places today in Aurora, Colorado and all over the country that employ these ridiculous ideas. I don't think it's local. I they don't know.

Speaker 3:          02:53:05       My life is basically, I think life is, if you look at your life, life is working really hard to get to, to accomplish something and losing to a degree anyway. Yeah. Learning how to navigate those failures are what motivate you to never feel that shitty feeling so it gets you off your ass. Yes. That's why people who are born rich or they win the lottery early, they're fucked. That's why we hate those people. The motivation just slides away. You know? There's very little motivation. If you're already wealthy. It's hard for me to relate to a dude who just grew up super rich and he's never had any struggles. It's hard to sit down and have dinner with that dude. I feel bad for me too. I feel too, because they have no idea. Especially you don't, you know any friends that are rich that were raised by like their nanny and shit?

Speaker 3:          02:53:47       Oh yeah. With a mom and dad are both working 20 hours a day and no one's ever home and they are fucking weirded out. A lost man. Oh yeah. Those rich guys who, who, who are surrounded by yes men and they come up like wearing a shitty holiday sweat and you're like nice fucking sweater and it ruins his night. You know, you'd like no one ever hangs out with guys. Must've. Yeah. No one ever busted bog. True sweetening. Sweet. You hear cut. That sucks. Or night. We were playing a cold, the silly game like running charades like a group of us and I made fun of the guy's boyfriend, the girl's boyfriend. We said that's not a word. He had some stupid movie and he dropped. He dropped the hat and threw his hands in the air and went off in the balcony. We were like, what? This salt that has grown from, cause he just gets really sensitive. Wow.

Speaker 3:          02:54:40       And a mouth. That's what happens. We don't keep score and shit. I was on a Sitcom once and this guy was adlibbing to something as an actor. It was a couple comics and an actor and the actor tried to ad Lib something and it wasn't funny at all and we stone faced it. We were like, what? Like he just wanted to try something different. How about I bought it. I say this and that, but it was really, he was not a bright guy and a, I remember we just looked at each other and we're like that. No, I don't think that works. He throws the fucking script up in the air going well with Dan. Always said is, I don't think that works. You tell that to a comic. They go, yeah, suck. Something fucked up about it. Right. Can you tell? It's even a lot of funny.

Speaker 3:          02:55:18       People just have good senses of humor and we started laughing so hard. Brennan pitched an idea for this thing we're gonna do. And I was like, oh, and then I go, let's get out of here. Is that you're having to go? That's, I couldn't stop laughing. I was like, that's not funny. I can't stop. Like we do all that, but we bust each other's balls. Do you only thing, I won't stand for it if you guys made fun of my talk. Well no, that's the only thing I put my foot down. It's not your life. Do you ever, have you ever gone back and read your notebooks from like your first years of comedy? Sure have dude. I have a notebook from when I was driving limos. I found it the other day. It's amazing. It's been awesome. It's unbelievably bad. I should have quit.

Speaker 3:          02:55:56       I bet it's awesome. I can't believe I kept going. I should have fucking retired so bad, like my ideas and to this day like sometimes I'll write ideas that are dog shit, but I write the ideas that are dog should hoping like, man, it's some fucking something. Write down like a half a concept and then I'll sit down and start working on it. Yeah. So it might've been that, but more likely I was just a 21 year old, retired with a pen. I want to tell you want to tell story but I'll make me sound bad. Too late. Ah dammit. Right. I'm just going to tell it. Don't judge me two minutes ago, this better not be someone else's. I was in Jamaica and I don't do drugs. I don't smoke weed. Getting high in Jamaica story again. I know. See I don't want to tell it now.

Speaker 3:          02:56:39       No, go. All right. If it's someone else's story, I don't can try finding it. I don't get done cocaine use at all. I was in Jamaica and somebody gave me some, I may have may or may not have done it all night and I then I wrote all night and kept waking up my girlfriend who you know, my old girlfriend and telling her what amazing bits and she was like, Huh? I was like, and God's a roster Farhan and I was high. I was doing last and writing, writing, writing and I looked at my notes and it was basically one long bit about God being a roster. Florian and I thought it was the greatest thing I've ever written in my life and it was just fucking chicken scratch. And the motto is historic kids just don't do cocaine in Jamaica because you are never going to write anything funny.

Speaker 3:          02:57:21       Brian Cowen will be appearing at some club and in the Lexington, Kentucky, Broadway better jokes than he just damaged us fighting God. Joe Frick. Exactly. Yeah.

The only thing that's on sports, it's funny you have it. It's the shouldn't be. It should be a comedy podcast. You cheating by being on sports. You know that I barely talk about sports. Yeah, you guys should need to move over to comedy and that's talk about sports occasionally because the people are, we do it. Look for funny shit and they miss you. They might miss a good point.
