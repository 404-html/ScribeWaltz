Speaker 1:          00:00:00       There it goes. Now it's recording. Alright ladies. Gentlemen, what's up? Welcome to the weekly podcast. I think it's like week 2000. What week is it Brian? Twenty fourth week. Brian is on top of shits on 24th week. And join today is a Jujitsu master musician, best friend Eddie the twister. Bravo. Ladies and gentlemen, how about a big round of applause for Mr. Eddie Bravo. Joining us here today. Eddie just had some pizza. Fuck that. Diet up son. Fucked it up. Yeah, I got a hold of. Got Real. We've got a real mix now, man. Solidarity if you want. Cool. When you talk right into it, it makes it so much better. We were having problems when we first started doing this. We just figured out how to do a podcast basically without asking anybody. We just trial and error and we fucked a lot of shit up and. But the biggest thing we fucked up in the beginning was the sound. The sound was really bad at first, but now we've got that shit locked down so that's good. What are you doing? He's practicing.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       Hold the mic like this. It's like smoking a cigarette and France. What movie is this front? There's a movie where a guy singing karaoke and he's holding the mic like that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       There's a many used to hang it in front of his face like this. I don't remember who it was like you're sucking a cock right here. Well, I've never said it. That flashlight. Yes, it was. Before we go anywhere. We're sponsored by the fleshlight. This podcast is a sponsored park at podcast, but I'll be quite honest with you, if we were not sponsored by the fleshlight and um, we just, we just became a subject of the conversation of the podcast. I will tell you, go buy one of those fucking things are awesome. Don't be embarrassed. Everybody jerks off. It's silly. You know, if you jerk off and you wouldn't fuck a rubber pussy, you're crazy all. It's just pleasure. It's just pleasure. And it feels way better than jerk. I got

Speaker 2:          00:01:51       a good flashlight story. Yeah. Oh, let's hear. It's about when I bought it about maybe like, I've, I've had it for awhile. I haven't. I've used it maybe a 20 times right now. It's fucking pretty good if you're going to jerk off something about your own hand touching your cock, cancels out some feeling or something, it doesn't feel as good as someone else jerking you off or whatever. So that's where the fleshlight comes in. I mean, that's it. It feels pretty fucking good. You got the right part or whatever. But anyways, about three years ago, maybe two years ago, I met this girl, uh, when we were on the road in Texas somewhere, maybe Houston or Dallas or something like that. I was on the road with you met her and um, we kept in touch. She came out to La and um, hung out for a weekend and for some reason she wasn't down at all.

Speaker 2:          00:02:43       She wasn't, she wasn't done at all. She didn't want to. She didn't want me to touch her. Now she's staying at my fucking house and she doesn't even want to touch me and kiss her or nothing. So I decided to take her to the hustler store and go shopping for a fleshlight this thing. So she couldn't fucking believe that she thought I was kidding. Then I went to the store to buy a flashlight. I'm like, Hey, if you're not going to give me the pussy, I got to know this is the second best thing. Can invite another girl over here. So, um, that's my fleshlight store. I used it that night too while she passed out and in. Just cool. It's pretty cool. It's better than using your hands. It's better than using your hand. If you had, if you could hire a Mexican to clean it up afterwards, then it would be awesome. It's just the cleanup Mexican. Why does it have to be a Mexican man? They worked cheap. You're going to put a white male, white dude to clean up your flashlight when you're done. You got to go to home depot and pick up a couple of guys and they'll switch off

Speaker 3:          00:03:43       target the other day. And there was these things called magic microphones for kids. It's a kid's toy that looks just like a fleshlight. If you look at it, you're like, oh, the same company that makes flashlights must also make this mike on my God. And so I pick it up and I go to my girlfriend, like, look, they got flashlights here and right. I look. I'm like, oh stupid. I look around. There's kids everywhere in mom's looking at me and if I cough, fuck yes.

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       It's funny how it's got a bad, like, you know, there's a bad feeling attached to it that there's something wrong with this rubber pussy. There's something wrong with pleasure. If it was just a massage thing, it was just like, look, I got a massage and makes your backfill. Awesome. Everybody be like, oh cool guys. Making is backfill. Awesome. There's something about making your dick feel awesome. That freaks everybody out. Which would freak out if your son.

Speaker 2:          00:04:26       I was using the flashlight at 11. Would that be bad? No. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:04:30       No, not at all. First Birthday, right? I would say, listen man, you're body is a biological organism that doesn't understand you know, your life. It wants you to make decisions for it, not for you. So it's going to try to trick you into fucking someone with no condom and having babies. I mean, that's what your body's trying to do. And it can get real confusing who you actually like as opposed to like who your Dick is telling you, you like, you know when you're horny all the time, you, your Dick convinces you that you like people you don't even like just because you could fuck them, you know. And for a kid when you're just learning how to get into relationships, that shit's very tricky. I think every young kid could benefit from. They should teach kids how to jerk off in school. They should teach kids how your Dick is going to confuse you and how it's going to send you all these messages.

Speaker 1:          00:05:14       And being horny is actually a baffling thing that takes years and years to master. And they can make. Hannah Montana flashlights came at $20,000,000,000 industry. I wonder if that would be illegal if she sponsored a fleshlight for high school kids. And she's not saying it's safe sex. Would that be insane? Why not, right? Yeah, that'd be so smart. I mean, we really pretending the kids aren't fucking, you know, kids get to be 16 years old. She's like 16 or 17. They're fucking man. They're fucking, the problem is even if she wants to like talk about it and shit, it's still illegal, you know, it's still, it's, they're not supposed to be fucking and no one's supposed to be fucking them. That's like older than them. I think they go to jail. You know, if you're,

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       if you're 18 and your girlfriend is 17 years and 10 months and you fucker, you go to jail. Is that really happening? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And people have gotten that bad. Yeah. It's real. God Damn it. Know what's happening. That's even scarier than that is a gang of kids are getting popped for child pornography for taking pictures with their pussies on their fucking cell phones. Oh Shit. Those are dicks. That's really what's happening, man. Down to getting in trouble, going it criminal tools. A girl was arrested on child pornography charges because she sent. She's 15 years old. She sent pictures of herself to a bunch of kids in their class and they eventually dropped the child pornography charges, but they charged with one count of using criminal tools. The criminal tool was a cell phone. That was a account they had against her. She took a cell phone to take a picture of her pussy. So that was a criminal tool. You that guys delete all that shit. How crazy is that man? Think about what it would be like.

Speaker 5:          00:06:54       Was your daughter and you found out that your daughter was doing the same thing? I think we talked about guys here. You guys talk about the exact same thing. The flashlight. Sorry guys. Just love talking about it. Denies The fleshlight store. Sexting. Sexting. Oh, the sex thing we talked about last time. It's still fascinating. Very important part of it. Pay attention to that twitter feed. Brian, I don't really want to know what people want us to talk about. Shut that shit off. That shit drives me crazy. You freaking me out, son. Wait, isn't that what we got here? Yeah, this is freaking me out too, but I don't read it. Don't read it too much, man. Then you're going to change the subject of your conversation. Listening to what they're saying. You're getting too serious about this, Joe. No, I'm not getting serious. It's distracting. It's distracting for good conversation.

Speaker 5:          00:07:35       So what'd you guys think about the new iphone that just was announced yesterday? It was pretty crazy that the iphone is a. is going to change a lot of Shit, man. First of all, everyone's going to be using it for phone sex because you could see the other person. You could see them. That's what's fucked up because I was thinking about this the other day. You know how texting and twitter and everything's fucking up. People's games are just lies in general. Now people are going to be like, your ex is going to call you or your girl is going to call you go, where are you at right now? You're like, I'm with my friends. Oh yeah, we'll turn on your video. Let me see where you're at. You know, and that's going to happen with boss, which doesn't have any Wifi. Well that's the only.

Speaker 5:          00:08:10       That's only for 2010. That's just because att and t is trying to build up their network. The network is ever going to get built up where they can handle two way phone calls with everybody because you know people are going to leave that shit on and they're going to. You're going to come to work with me. Okay. And they're going to be walking around. People aren't going to be watching where they're going. Absolutely. That's why your phone, that's why a t and t regulated their data plans the other day because they know that that shit's going to happen. So do you think they're just building up to it? How are they going to be like when texting first came out, when you first got texting, everyone said this is not going to work. No one's going to ever do this, but in texting plans are really expensive and ridiculous, you know, because all these newcomers are, you know, used to get jokes about texting.

Speaker 5:          00:08:51       I just hit my fucking 2005 showtime special. There's a joke in there when I'm like, it takes you four presses to get an s. Why you? Why don't you just fucking call me? What are you doing? Are you making me read? Right? You know, this is going to be exactly like, just think about how much that's changed in five years. You have video content, video calling in five years from now is going to be the norm. You, that's all it's going to be. It's not going to be. People are gonna Laugh at you from normal calling, you know, I think. I think that's, you know, we're going towards star trek. We are, we are.

Speaker 2:          00:09:19       It's going to be called something to like when someone like a girlfriend calls you up and facetime, I need a Web, a web cam scan, you know what I mean? Okay. Here's the way. So you've got to tell all your buddies that used to be at a party and go web cams. All the girls duck under and go, look, look, honey, I'm here. Boom. Oh look it. Then Bam. A quick little ones over to you just have the whole Party spin behind you. Just move really slowly. It's the web cam scan. Fucking moving fast enough. Okay. You better web cam scan right now. Inner Circle. As quick as you can show me after a while. You're gonna have to do a quick, it can't be fast, but then people are just going to get faster. They're just gonna be. It's going to be a sport. You know, you will have gambling to see whether or not you can tell those people in the room. Okay, let's go into the bathroom. It's to look behind the curtain. Okay, now let's go to the back.

Speaker 5:          00:10:11       Cool fucking game. How about this game? How about you? You have a game where you bet whether or not someone is in someone's house and someone takes you on a tour of their house and you bet whether or not this other people in the house hiding.

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       How about you have every recorded prerecorded fucking scenarios. You have like 30 of them, your house one, you're at your mom's, you have all these files and then you know they think it's live, but it's really a a video. We got to get on that. You don't have a problem with it.

Speaker 5:          00:10:37       You would have to show your face too. You're supposed to show your face talking environment. They're going to have to. It would be like almost like a green screen. The great joy ideas. When I was talking to him about this, Joey Diaz says he's going to be like, imagine calling your girl and go, let me see your pussy right now. See how red it is. I know what it looks like after you got fucked. Hold it up against white. Let me see

Speaker 2:          00:10:56       the color

Speaker 5:          00:10:59       showing her pussy. Yeah. Yeah, because then we. Because seriously, that's how it's going to come down to. You're going to be able to just go, let me see what your pussy looks like right now. I can tell you that statement. That that just shows you the mentality of Joey ideas. How Funny Joey is. Joey is thinking about tricking girls in the show and their pussy.

Speaker 2:          00:11:18       You know, he's all about. No, no, no, no, no. I need to see it right now. Come on, let's go. What do you got? Like it's all about.

Speaker 5:          00:11:24       It's all about like trapping them in the show, in their pussy. It's not even really asking them. It's like part of the hustle for it. For Joey. You trick them.

Speaker 2:          00:11:31       I think it's gonna. I think it's gonna make people a lot more faithful because I really believe that like twitter and facebook and facebook has really. It makes it so hard to cheat. People are like, okay, if I'm going to, there's a lot more single people because it's way too hard and a cheat, but if you decide to have a girlfriend or boyfriend, you're like, fuck it. I ain't even going to try. You make a comment on one person's picture. Everybody knows that you just commented on

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       some girl's picture, you know, so it's like you don't even, you don't even bother, so you might as well be faith and it's not going to stay where it's at. It's gonna, it's gonna move on to some next craziness and I, I think that has to do with this iphone camera. I think that's the next stage of craziness. The next stage of intrusion into people's lives and some people are going to reject it. You know? Did you do just like textbook? Just like texts, just like picture messages. So like everything. That's why when people are freaking out about flash, it's. I feel the same thing about that. You know, you people are freaking out because you're not thinking ahead, you're not, you're not thinking about what's next or what's going to be the future. You just say freaking them out. Flash for the non technologically a macromedia flash what?

Speaker 5:          00:12:31       Macromedia flash is a program on your websites when you see like animation and different kinds of like, you know, you put your cursor over something and it does some funky thing. Most of the time you're dealing with flash and a lot of these sites and apparently flash crashes a lot. I've had a crush a bunch of times on me and Microsoft has their own version of shit. What is it? Silver Light. So yeah, but what's cool is that there's actually companies now that have software that if you put it into flash, and I guess flash is working with this company that if you go to this website and it has flash, flash will detect that you do not have flash on your ipad or whatever and it will convert it into an html five point. Oh uh, a program or whatever. So that's what youtube does.

Speaker 5:          00:13:13       No, I think youtube just uses a different CODEC. There's some websites where you can go to on the IPAD and you can still watch videos and that's html five. You're watching, you're watching it. Just a flashes has moved on from our youtube. Doesn't use flash as much anymore. It uses I a Codec h two point six, four, I believe. Uh, so it's not even in flash anymore. You're watching it. Just, you're just watching a video file. I think you're right that people are hesitant to change and then they worry about flash falling apart and you know, they say, oh this is crazy. You know, my website is coded like this and that's just how it should be. But when new shit comes along that's better. You just got to accept it, you know? I think what's more fascinating to me than anything is a facetime thing and the, the rise of the droid phones do a droid phones or luck an infection.

Speaker 5:          00:13:57       There's like so many Goddamn droid phones now and they do everything the iphone does and more like, you know what the iphone has, you know, the front face feature. That's a camera. Come on. Blackberry, blackberry, blackberry. Still number one droids nothing new. It's just an operating system like windows mobile wise. These are dope ass phones. Dope. Dope. As phones that are doing something that's trying to be like an iphone now, you know, I mean, and it's not doing it as good. If you use any application on a droid and compare it to the iphone version, almost 99 point nine percent of the time it falls a little short. Okay. If, uh, you're saying this based on the little experience that you had. No, no, no. I've had it for a month. I used to straight for a month and I know from that operating system what they were doing back then is the same as now it's all the same. It's the exact same. I use the newest one that had the newest version. It's the to Motorola

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       droid. Right. Which is not supposed to be as good as this htc evo. You're talking about the hardware though. You're not talking about the operating system. Yeah, but I mean didn't, didn't the, I'm just an htc alter the operating system a little bit. It puts a skin on it that just makes it. That's all it is. It's just a skin off the operating systems. We make your work more effectively and some say that hurts. Some say it's better. You know what it does is it gives you a nice little widget at the front that has the weather and a bunch of shit. Okay. Well just saying that the iphone is better. Okay. I'll agree with you. You believe the iphone is better, but it's still a fucking amazing phone and if it was. If it existed a year ago, you. You'd be freaking the fuck out of existed five years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:15:27       It'd be world changing. Five years ago. I would probably be freaking out a year ago. I doubt it. It's a very impressive phone. Yeah. That phone hardware itself is great, but when you compare like somebody was going off on the other day about how like, Oh yeah, this has an eight mega pixel camera or the new iphone only has a five megapixel camera, and I was like, mega pixels don't mean shit. That's why like every year we've stopped like at 12 megapixels for most cameras and if you notice like most Sony cameras that were 12 megapixels last year, now 10 megapixel. Okay, well why doesn't mean shit? I mean those guys. Mega pixels doesn't mean much information is in the photograph and mega pixels don't mean shit. It means something. Camera sucks. We know that 12 megapixel cameras, awesome. You could blow up giant bill bright's. So it does mean something.

Speaker 3:          00:16:11       It means something to us, it means something to a point. But the most important thing is the lens and the actual, the, the quality of photo. That's why. Okay, that makes sense. That makes a new. The new iphone camera has a, what most normal camels are just switching to. It's this a coil that goes around the lens and it used to be where the coil was in front of the lens optics. So when you take a photo, uh, the, the light has to go through all these coils in order to take a photo. So now they found out how to fight the coil on the back. So the light, there's more light that goes in that goes in there. So many calls that the Xmo our lens, whatever it's called, but now so now this new iphone's going to have better low light just because they decided to do this new coil technology.

Speaker 3:          00:16:53       So that alone photo, quality megapixel doesn't mean shit. It really means something. Now Brian, you're getting crazy. No, no, no, no. I'm being serious. Megapixels did not mean shit anymore when it comes to like five megapixels and above eight megapixels, like 10 to 12 megapixels. There's nothing. Eight to 12. There's barely anything, but it still means something. Unless you're doing billboards. It's what's important is the lens and how important the software they use. It's also important. You know what kind of, you know how the. That's why you have these Carl Zeiss lenses and shit on all these different phones. You know, they're trying to get the dopest lens as possible. Yeah, I agree. Over a certain point it's negligible and you're a bad motherfucker. You knowledge of all this shit is unbelievable. You frequent it comes to this stuff. But what I think of the iphone, who knows when I get it, but God it, they just solved everything. They got the video camera sucked. I use it all the time, but it's not now it's HP. It's. Yeah, that's still true. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:17:49       for sure. But it's even, you know, for me, I barely talk on the phone anyways. I really don't give a shit. What I care about is video pictures and texting. That's huge. And emails and stuff and then you get on twitter and all that stops to a credible. I don't care about talking to Peter's applications

Speaker 1:          00:18:06       on your phone that you can time rounds with. It was like a gym boss where you can time your workouts, you can, it's a free application to you. You could set it so that it'll like, it'll put interval training into your workouts and give you like different alarms like when you run and when you stop, when you rest, when you go.

Speaker 2:          00:18:21       I mean the flash, that Webcam at the HD video, five megapixels, God damn think

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       these, um, these new droid phones are catching up

Speaker 3:          00:18:31       though. They're totally catching up and I hope they beat the iphone, but the problem is if all these droid user saying, Oh fuck, fuck, iphone, no, no, get this. How's your facebook and you want to do like a comparison. How is your facebook on your application facebook and compared to iphones, apple, twitter in a while. Right? Don't they update those food? I am on every single website everyday on both the joy and everything. I know exactly what's going on with android versus iphone every day. Oh no, totally common. Is that a common argument? Dude? It's common with down the line. Every program that you get for the iphone is it's way more fine tuned on the iphone for some reason. I don't know if it's on purpose or if it's just the length or the, you know that developers or what, but like even the twitter applications and the same with the palm tree. The palm pre should have been fucking the number one phone. That should have been way bigger than it was, but the problem is every single application like their facebook, their twitter and everything, it doesn't even come close to the iphone and it's still

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       killed them. You don't think that it was on sprint.

Speaker 3:          00:19:31       I can tell you as having a palm pre plus that every single program that you can download for that thing sucks. Shit. Compared to the iphone versions and the pump has been out for a year plus longer than the web. So that'll be doing shit doing shit.

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       No, they are. It's interesting because the palm pre was like the number one selling product that a sprint that have launched as a phone until this a htc evo came along and they're saying this pump everything. It's really what's. What's interesting about it was it was like the number one thing, but then it petered out and nobody gives a fuck about it. You know, like no one's like in line to get palm trees.

Speaker 2:          00:20:06       Not at all. Actually. Remember the trio, the trio with the trio. You gave me a second. The trio was the was. That was the original trio was a brick bro. I remember wanting to bother me. I remember when you gave me your trio, dude, that first day. I couldn't believe it, man. I thought I was just. I really thought like I had a fucking time and watching. I swear I thought. I said, look, I just think it's so awesome. I remember I had, when I first got it, I got it out of the box and everything that I was playing with and I was like looking at Wayne. I was like, this is the ultimate piece that's like star Trek. It's like a fucking computer in my pocket, man.

Speaker 3:          00:20:44       Never good thing. Is the texting on the or

Speaker 5:          00:20:47       that. Just the keyboard alone. Have you ever used the keyboard? No. You know what I did use though, that was pretty dope and I wish someone would figure out how to do it. I found sorta doesn't, but I had with my Microsoft phone, I had a windows, windows mobile phones. It knew the words that I was going to use, like if I would press a and then B, it would. Right, absolutely. If I've said that a bunch of times and text before and then you just hit the space button and you keep going onto the next predictive texting. Yeah, but like, like crazy good man. It was really good. It was really interesting. The iphone always gets things wrong and never wants to accept my swears. I still wasn't changed. Fuck to duck. I mean, how many times do I say this? There's ways around that.

Speaker 5:          00:21:26       There's something like you just make a new contact and you just put all the cuss words you want in it or something like I forget. Something like that. And so it looks it up. Yeah, I do. I think you just make a contact and go, fuck cock suck Dick Piss. You know everything you want. Yeah. You just do it once a. yeah, I know, but it's so silly. Like why can't it remember swears? Well, the new operating system, I guess as 100 times better when it comes to all this, like the Vocab, that dictionary that everything and it's got. Now we finally get multitasking. Now Brian's got an apple phone or on your fan. Boy, I'm not a fan boy because I'm with any kind of technology. I try them all and I. I picked my man. I'm just teasing you. How many phones, how many phones have we both between you?

Speaker 5:          00:22:10       Haven't we always go right back to the iphone. The iphone is most certainly the best all around device without a doubt, but my main phone, I use a blackberry because it's verizon because verizon is way better for me. I need, I need to make calls like that game's over for me now. Really? I have no problems with a t and t anymore and in Los Angeles. Well my problems with a t and t are driving, driving from my house into legends. Others. There's three places where I would lose people, so if I'd be in a big conversation I'd have to pull over because I didn't want to. I didn't want to lose the call. If it was something that was, you know, it was serious. I can't talk in my bedroom on the phone. If, if I, if I want to talk, I got to go to my living room if it's an important call.

Speaker 5:          00:22:50       I walked down the street, I actually, I'm, if you see me talking on the phone, walking at some important as shit right there, don't bother me. Eventually there's going to be no home. Phone's right. There is barely any home phones. I hardly know. My, my dad doesn't even have a home phone anymore and it's like some ancient shit. You know, home phone doesn't send no tax, can't get pictures. Just some stupid line where people call you. It's funny. My mom lives in the middle of the country. Urgency in case the world ends. You need a landline solar flares. Fuck, fuck up those satellites. There was an article I was reading about that about. We're at a moment of the sons awakening and that the next couple years is unprecedented solar activity. That's they predicted so unprecedented solar flares that could wipe out satellites and so what they're trying to get really good at is predicting these events so that they can shut down or put these satellites on safe mode, which is pretty nuts when you think about how much we're reliant

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       on the satellites and you know for, for satellite radio. I can listen to it every day for, you know, for so many different things. For GPS, we're, you know, we're reliant on fucking satellites and those motherfuckers can get cooked, they can get cooked. I mean, at any time the Sun could just make some hiccup, a Burp, a Fart, and it just barbecues every fucking satellite at cs.

Speaker 6:          00:24:08       They got to have backup satellites and like just slow out there and protective cases. So if anything happens, the other ones they just press a button. That shit. Yeah. That opened the new case. Boom. What if they're gonna do

Speaker 1:          00:24:17       put shields over satellites like big radiation shields that's going to have to be the next field, something like that before it's filled. It's got to have something to do with magnets and force fields. Well, yeah, you're right. Because that's what our gravity is, right? Our, our, our magnetosphere, right, right. And the, um, the, the gas that surrounds the earth and the, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:24:36       our atmosphere, we just suspend some gold dust particles in the atmosphere will be fine. Zacharias stitch and style.

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       So Eddie's a big proponent of the ancient alien theory and a Eddie's the first person that ever got me into Zacharias Hitchin and we've had dude, how many bones have we smoked? Fucking talking about the auto lock.

Speaker 6:          00:24:55       We've had more, more ridiculous

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       spaceman alien auto knocky conversations, ancient ancient tribe theories. Shit where, you know, civilizations died off and left so much information that was just last forever. Like the Mayans and of course the Sumerians and now sand the Sumerians talk of an even older civilization before then. So Eddie, Eddie's the one that got me into

Speaker 6:          00:25:18       the first. Scott, right? It's about Redondo, right? No, no, no. He actually, he brought it up to me. No, he brought it up, but I didn't. It never registered. He goes, dude, listen to this radio station coast to coast. There's like 10 years ago. And I never listened to Scott. But Gina, the first girl I produced musically, she's about as crazy as they come. And she's. She was talking about a party, talented girl, super, super talented singer, but crazy. She goes, oh my God. I was at this party last night and this guy was talking about how we recreated as slaves to mine gold for aliens on another planet. I'm like, oh my God, shut up. Shut the fuck up. Because no, everybody was tripping out on this guy talking about this. This. I'm like, aliens made us as slaves to mine gold. Shut the fuck up.

Speaker 6:          00:26:06       Let's get to work. So I thought about it later on that day, that whole day I thought about it and I and I, and I thought it was weird that it's crazy as all that sounded. It is weird that the one thing that we all agree on, every culture, every race, we can agree on shit, politics, religion, nothing. But we all agree that gold is worth more than money. That gold is the universal money. And I thought that was weird. I go, hmm. And then I thought about how the Aztecs thought Cortez was a god and they gave them gold and then the people, the pharaohs that die and they get buried, they get buried with gold and like thinking about this and like this. Can I call Gina Gina? What was this guy's name? Do you have his number? Because that was Jodie or some guy, I think his name was Jodie, so I called this guy and go, hey, I'm, I'm a genius because what you were talking about some gold and some slaves and aliens.

Speaker 6:          00:27:01       What the fuck was that about? And he didn't even really know. He said, you know what? Yeah, yeah, I was talking about that. Some guy told me it was weirdest thing. I think his name is Syed Gen or are such an or something sits in or something. So I looked it up and I just got on the Internet and I looked up sitch and started getting into it and it blew me away. It's pretty fascinating shit, you know, as crazy as that sounds, if you really look into it all, all the basically it's, it's this at Zachariah such as this guy, the transcribed, the ancient Sumerian text for like 20,000 tablets have all these stories and all this shit. Who knows what they really say because very few people can actually transcribe it. Uh, some people think Zacharias stitching is crazy and he just making shit up. Um, some, a lot of people believe him. I mean, he's got this, I mean, a lot of smart people.

Speaker 1:          00:27:49       Well, the interesting shit that he uncovers and shows in his, um, in his videos that's just indisputable is the images that the Sumerians left behind. That's where it gets really crazy because there's images of a big giant person with a small person. It's a person, but it has a tail like a monkey. And you're like, what the fuck is that? They have the double helix, the DNA double helix is there caduceus, you know, they have that in, in their images. What if it was just like a Fez ben guy that walked around the tribe, you know, that it's dressed up as a cat in somebody's true. Oh, you know what I mean? It could, it could be. But here's the other thing, they also had a detailed depiction of the solar system. They had a picture of the sun and then they had the picture of the planets in the, with the proper size in the proper orbit orbit.

Speaker 1:          00:28:34       And on top of that, their, their whole history there, you know, there's the, in the Sumerian text it talks about the different planets, it talks about your readiness and it talks about Neptune, you know, it talks about the creation of earth. They have the exact same theory that we have as far as the creation of the moon. The theory is that Earth one, there was an earth, it was like billions of years ago, it got hit with a planet and created the moon. And now we are earth to post impact. Now this is something that scientists had just recently embraced over the past few decades, but sitch and wrote about this shit way back in the seventies. I mean, this was, this was at the Sumerian said, you know, the guy, if you watch his, his documentaries and you listen to such and talk and get his shit online, it is fucking fascinating. You know, and I'm not saying that, you know, some aliens made us as you know, as a race of slaves. But I am saying that the world is so crazy as it is the, the fact that we could send photographs to people and you can get video, download it from your phone and you can basically answer any question that immediately by pressing, you know, google or are they

Speaker 6:          00:29:42       the Google thing where you know, you talk into it and you say, you know, what year did Columbus sail, blah blah blah, and it'll give you the information. Like instantly this has never happened before. Man, there's this crazy shit and it's only gonna get crazier now. If we live a 100,000 years longer and stayed alive and managed to keep evolving, for sure, we would get to the point, would be able to travel to other planets and find other species that we thought weren't advanced enough and fuck with them if we decided a certain point in time with all this investigation that we're doing into live, like what they're doing right now with synthetic cells where they are creating cells, creating cells, and eventually creating living organisms. This is all really going to happen. If we get to the point where we realize that life itself is just a code that we can manipulate and change to our will, well when that happens, man, you're not going to think anything's wrong with taking some monkeys and making them smarter and having them work for you, you know, and if there's a super intelligent being or, or, or race of beings that's thousands of years advanced from us or millions or perhaps even a billion, you know, what if they live in a protected solar system where they don't have to worry about asteroids, what if the asteroid impact is, is not a common thing would if, you know, all this shit that happens in our solar system is kind of rare.

Speaker 6:          00:30:56       And in other solar systems, they don't have media problems. I mean, if that's the case, if that's true, they could be a billion years older than us. We don't fucking know. We have no idea. Yeah. Uh, basically switching was one of very few people, again, that transcribed over 20,000 tablets and these tablets were all like in detailed descriptions of how they can down the names of the rulers. And the South American ones, they real technical shit about how it all went down. He transcribed all that shit in the seventies and uh, and he put all this information out, all this information that he wasn't, he's saying that he wasn't making it up. He was just transcribing all these stories and people are, or a lot of people, you know, his daughters were like, well, he's full of Shit. How could he know this? And how could he know that?

Speaker 6:          00:31:43       But the few things that he did know in the seventies that, uh, we were just figuring out now, one in his transcriptions, he talked about how the Sumerians knew that Uranus and Neptune were both water twins and we just found that out in the eighties that they actually are water twins. That was new. How the hell did such a know this? Another thing is such. And the basis of the story is aliens need our acumen. They look just like us. They're just, they're supposedly. And uh, we'll, we'll, uh, maybe taller or whatever. But are they way better looking than they need our gold to ces to turn into gold dust, to suspend in their atmosphere, to protect their atmosphere. That's what they need. He's talking to them from radiation. Yes. That's what he's talking about. And the seventies and the transcriptions, he's not an astrophysicist. We just found out like in 2001, 2002 that that's exactly how you protect atmospheres.

Speaker 6:          00:32:35       You take metallic particles and you suspend them in the atmosphere to, you know, either keep radiation and or out. We just figured that out. How the hell did this guy figure out through the. And he's saying, well, he didn't know he transcribed. He, he did. He just guessed that that's the way we protect atmospheres. He already talked about that. There's a lot of. I mean, he gets into details a lot of shit that makes it like home. Wow. There's a lot. There's a lot to. It sounds crazy and we don't have all day to talk about it, but have an open mind. It's fascinating stuff. I thought it was towed to the thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       There's a, there's a bunch of debate about this planet Nibiru and there's a guy who's got a website called [inaudible]. Sitchin is wrong and his website is stitching is wrong.com, and this guy does not believed that there was, that there's this planet Nibiru and he has the quotes to tax. It's really involved and I haven't really looked into it. I don't know who the fuck is right and who's wrong. I really don't, but I do know that the, just all the shit that came out of that one area is really fascinating and when you find out that one part of the world is responsible for the first mathematics, the first astronomy, first astrology, first written language first, use the wheel first. Everything first agriculture was Iraq. It's Iraq because Iraq. Yeah. Crazy fucking nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       First organized. Well, that's why they're so fucked up. That's why I've always said that that part of the world, the reason why there are laws are so archaic. They're like the townies of the world. Those are the people that were there when civilization was created and they're still rock. They're still rocking that ancient law. You know, you dance, we throw rocks at you, you fuck someone from the other tribe, we throw rocks at you, you show your ankles, we throw rocks at you. Why is. Why is an agent that's smart though have now has not progressed like they stopped. Everybody moved out to California, left like, what is California? California is the group of people that landed somewhere else new. It sucked and move to the best box. Eventually you figure out that the best Bot of southern California, you're figuring out, wait a minute, there's a spot where it never gets so cold that it's knows okay. There's no hurricanes. You have to worry about earthquakes every now and then, but there's no lightning as worst traffic in the rural. It was the worst traffic in the world, but like as far as rules that climate has nothing. It has nothing to do with climate. Yeah. It's like the climate here is the reason why everybody flocks to this place. It's way easier to live here. No, that is true.

Speaker 6:          00:34:55       It's like a club promoters. When a club in La, when a club rises and falls, the club promoters don't die with the club. They just find a new location and they just keep moving the original club with some area. It was blowing up, it was going off. Then it closed down, the promoters moved to Egypt, they blew that up for awhile. That shit close down. People got tired of Egypt, then they blew it up in Israel that have change all the names and in all their uh, um, uh, their stories of creation. Then it went to Rome and then it split off and then it ended up in England and Germany and the united. It's totally okay. That makes

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       sense of that part of the world is backwards because it's just like going back home. I mean, that's what I'm talking about. It's like going back home, if I went back home to Boston and hung out, I would think like, God, like the dudes I went high school with like two, you're, you're still living in this fucking this crazy land. Like why didn't you escape? And that's like what it's like in air. It's like Sumir, you know, it became Iraq and everybody eventually moved on to other places of the world, people who weren't satisfied with where they were and how life was, if that's where all human beings supposedly came from, everybody who left as a people that were trying to find something better. It kind of makes sense. It kind of makes sense that if everybody, if that really is the cradle of civilization and everybody left from there and trying to find something better, of course the people that are remained suck just totally make sense. Dom didn't suck. How dare you, how dare you,

Speaker 2:          00:36:13       how dare you. How dare everybody listening to this at this point in time stolen. Motherfucker get him to the Greek. Eddie, did you like it? I loved it. I love. What would you rate it as? Five stars? Not quite as good as hangover, but right under hangover, like, like, uh, it was, I thought it was really good, man. I laughed out loud. At least 10. There was a good 10 times where I was like, aw, they killed it. That dude, the main dude, the fat guy, he's awesome. I love that guy. He is pretty good. That guy is bad. He's funny and every they must let him go off because it's not a coincidence that he always has great lines and you know, who impressed me fucking p diddy is acting was like 80 percent on. It wasn't, but it was way better than fifty cents. It was an academy award winning performance. But he pulled it off and he made me laugh too. There's an argument with that one rnb singer member with the pink shirt. What's that guy's name? That was hilarious, dude. That was funny dude. It was so funny that putting it in, putting it in the previews now that's part of the pre.

Speaker 1:          00:37:17       So don't, don't give any spoilers away. But uh, I love that Russell brand go to diddy was the probably the best part about that movie though. He was good and I posted that on my twitter. That was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. It was so ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          00:37:33       You can splice. No, you could tell. She didn't think I could tell. I thought that made me look bad.

Speaker 1:          00:37:37       Bad Ass. I was so looking forward to that movie, I was like,

Speaker 2:          00:37:41       did it die? A horrible death at the box office. It actually didn't do that good. I wasn't in the top.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       It got 70 something percent on rotten tomatoes. But listen how crazy this movie is. Okay. This guy has his girlfriend, they're both scientists. They're doing all these experiments with human DNA and they figured out how to synthesize human DNA with a animal DNA. I phenols lizards or some shit. I don't know what the fuck I spliced it with. So uh, they just wanted to see if they could do it. So they. So she closes the door and does it, you know, like, like. So he like, he can't stop her and he runs in and she presses the button. It's like really ridiculous and she makes this half human being half animal lizard fucking thing. Whatever the fuck it was. It's the source. So goofy. So they raised this is, this is a person. Yeah. All spoiler. Like a motherfucker

Speaker 2:          00:38:26       plug your ears. Yeah, I'm still gonna. See it. You're you to see this. Okay. Because I have a feeling that I'm going to like it because I've, I've read, I've actually, because after you made me not see

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       it, and then so then I kind of got angry and then I said I was talking to him with some friends of mine and they said, dude, what is he talking about? That movie was fucking awesome. Oh my God. You like Nacho Libre? And we walked out. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's a libra was just you guys walking now. So dumb in three minutes. No you don't. No, you don't know how dumb this will. This movie makes Nacho libra looked like it was awful, but you guys only gave me like three or five minutes or something like you're like, was bad, was offensive. It was hurting my hand. There's no way. There's no way they had. They had like 20. I gave him 20 attempts at jokes to people in the front lap and I'm like, damn, these are their drugs. Like if you're waiting this long to throw in some funny shit, there's no way that ending's going to be good

Speaker 4:          00:39:19       black fan. I think he's hilarious. I love his movies. I love that rock and roll high. Whatever the fuck it was rock school. That was good. It was really good and he was excellent in tropic thunder. Green that King Kong. I haven't seen tropic. Still haven't seen tropic thunder. It's one of my, that's for sure. Hangover. Tropic thunder is a for sure. Hang on. Okay, I'll see it. I keep fucking putting it off. But um, yeah, I mean that movie was whatever this, the splice is way worse. Just the splice. Pluggers bitch. I will see it by this. This is how crazy it is. They make this thing okay. Grows really quick. Okay. And all of a sudden it's from a baby. It grows like almost instantly to a grown woman. So they have this grown woman alien thing and they don't know where to keep her.

Speaker 4:          00:39:59       So they keep her in a storage room. They're like, nobody goes down there. So they set up a bedroom in the fucking storage place where they work and the fucking alien. They're okay. The thing's only been alive for like a couple months and then Adrian Brody fucks it. No, now I got to see it, so fucking not only is it an alien, like we'll crazy. It's got a tail, a fucked up legs and everything, but it's also three months old. He's fucking this thing. It's three months. Her body, she's got tits and she's kind of like sexy looking. It's like they took a sexy chicken. Just did some CGI on her. Wow. Yeah. She escaped and eats a rabbit. She escapes and she can fly. She's got wings. She flies. She lands in Eatsa fucking rabbit and then not even freaking out. They're like, why are you doing that? Don't do that. Stop. It's ridiculous. It's so bad. I'm going to see it. I'm going to see it. That sounds good, Brian. So you know why you know why he did. He has to go see it. Yeah. It has to be. I'm not hurting it. Let me tell you something. Don't you wish that this movie is so goddamn bad? I think it might turn into one of those movies that's like a cult hit because it's so bad. People are going to go see it

Speaker 5:          00:41:04       again. I. This is what I did hear about it. I heard that there was actually personally that we're supposed to be funny now. It has nothing to do with it. Like a humor to where I try to be funny if they were there, they said it in an interview that a lot of people aren't getting the humor of the movie. Oh my God. You mean the whole movie, the whole movie. It's like, are you sure that you weren't baked and you didn't get like the humor like serious or something? I wasn't big at all. In your defense, Brian, I think he might like it because you're like crazy shit like that.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       Nobody liked him. If you go in wanting to see something ridiculous, you're going to like it, but if you go in thinking you're going to get the shit scared out of you. Like some new alien movie. That's what I thought it was going to be. When I saw like it was just like she was threatening the in in the previews looks like she's threatening one of the scientists. I'm like, oh, they create something and it's fucking crazy and it gets out of control and it's scary. I'm to see it this week and I can't wait to discuss it. I can't wait to discuss it with you. I might bring a bag of rocks thrown at you because there has been. There has been movies that, that, that we totally disagree. It's kind of funny how people get upset when someone likes something. They don't like iphones yet.

Speaker 5:          00:42:09       Like anything. What about my group or did you like the group or. But I, when I first saw the preview, I thought it looked like the dumbest fucking movie I've ever seen in my life and I heard his awesome dog shit. I heard it was awesome. No, I heard of dogs really like group. I haven't heard a thing I haven't heard of. It was stupid on snl. How the hell did they make a movie? Review looks retarded and SNL is like one of those things. It's really been kept alive because of youtube clips. You know, when a good snl sketch gets on youtube and makes you want to watch snl again? It was, I would have no notice are kept alive by Andy Sandler, whatever his name is, who's at the young guy that makes all those skits like on a boat and stuff. That dude's hilarious.

Speaker 5:          00:42:47       Oh, is he the one that's. I've never seen that sketch, but I heard that song. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's. He does all these like little skits on Saturday night live and it makes the show in my opinion that in that one main girl on there. That's hilarious. Dude. I haven't watched that live in years. I haven't watched it in so long. A good monologue on youtube or something like that. There's just certain shows that after awhile I'm like, that's it. Done. I can't. I can't keep coming back to that. Well, you know, you fucked me too many times. Andy Sanberg. That's why I got into. Just got into true blood. You guys. Oh No. I watched half an episode and I was just silliness to watch it from the first time I've watched. I've won so goddamn tired of vampires don't eat people kind of nonsense people.

Speaker 5:          00:43:30       Barely. Well, they got to do, you know the premise of it? Yeah. They have some fake blood that they use and they finally came out. Vampires or it's like, you know, it's like, why do you like that show? I did get bored. I like, that's like mixing vampires with Gilmore girls. That's the worst shit ever. Man. That's so gay. I only watched someone. You got to see if I've seen. I've seen the first whatever season, two seasons or whatever, two seasons and stop after five. There's been many shows where I've watched because of my girlfriend, so that's one of them, that bandwidth to see sex and the city to 50 times better than that show. But no, that show to me was just, I can't, I couldn't even. I was amazed that people like that show. I thought I liked the purpose. I like it a texture and the other guy, I never watched that show. I watched dexter. I never watched the show, but I did watch half an episode and I was like, you know what? I have just hit vampire overload.

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       Too many fucking vampire shows. Man. It's too silly. There's too many different rules that people are making up for vampires now. Like, oh, they can go on the light, but they just sparkle like, fuck you, man. No, there's some rules for vampires. All right. The rule is if you're gonna, drink people's blood. When the sun comes out, you fucking die. Bitch. You supposed to hide. You hide in the dark. He can't be going to high school walking around with everybody because it's cloudy. That's retarded. This is stupid. This is fucking. You can't keep doing this. And it's like it's. It's to me, it's a symptom of our culture. All these vampire movies are a symptom of our culture. We live in fact empires for real. The reason why people are so into this, it's like when you, when, when you look at like how infantiles our culture is, we want to believe that you know that there is silly fake shit out there like, like vampires. We believe so much retarded shit as far as just what the government feeds us. The news feeds us and with corporations feed us and you know our, our perceptions of how we have this world under control and everything's fine and no wars are just and all the crazy shit that we justify ourselves doing. If we can believe all that shit, you know, why not fam powers? It's a fucking half a step away, step away. Is there a movement or their websites about people that really have evidence that vampires really. There's people that.

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       People who've committed murders because of that, because they believe they're vampires. Totally. There's people that think they're werewolves. You know, they take their fucking clothes. Oh, the yellow. There's, there's people that shaped their teeth and fangs. Eddie. There's people that shaved their teeth and fangs point in time. It's like, yeah, okay, look, the guy's not undead and yeah, he's not. He's not going to live forever and he's not going to drink people's blood to stay alive, but people are crazy enough to think that they are vampires. Truly to truly believe it and actually go out and murder somebody and drink their blood. People are that nuts, man. What if that's real shit? If you're a fucking complete and total loser and you have nothing going on in your life, your life is unbelievably bad and the only thing that's exciting is the thought of biting someone's neck and sucking their blood out and kill them.

Speaker 1:          00:46:33       Do you guys look at that? Buyers are have hockey blood and they. Did you hear about. Did you guys hear about that case in Texas? I think it was 2006 slash six slash six slash 2006 with a woman named her kids after Satan. Like they were named after like satanic names and then on that day she murdered them on and I drank their bladders. Oh my God. Really? I think it was 2006. Oh Man. That Satan thing is the surest sign that you're fucking bananas if you believe in Jesus. That's one thing. It seems like, you know, I mean maybe there was a real person that existed, but all the magic things attributed to him really. And you're gonna believe that just because it was a long time ago. That seems to be, to me completely silly, but it's acceptable. It's like, okay, I understand where you're coming from.

Speaker 1:          00:47:19       I understand that's what you believe. I understand. You know, everybody has their own point of view, but when you start talking about devil's, you started talking about Satan like Jesus Christ. Really you think there's a fucking bad man who's pulling strings and tempting you with pussy and cigarettes and you really, you think that's real. That is a devil makes you make bad decisions and and it makes you rape and beat people up and you think the devil's doing that tempting. You Die. That's so infantiles. It's amazing that people even consider it and we know that there's, there's a part of us that knows that talking about the devils. Ridiculous. That's why you don't hear the president talking about it. The president will always talk about God. He'll never talk about the devil, the president that may God bless our troops. You know, we believe that God is on our side.

Speaker 1:          00:48:05       Like Bush said, a bunch of Wacky God shit. Never once did he say, we have found Satan and he's in Iraq. We know where Satan is. What we're going to drill to the core of the earth until we find tracks. Say You met, you've met him at all. You mentioned st at all and you're fucking crazy. You can say, you know, we believe we have found the actual cross that Jesus was nailed on and people will go, wow, holy shit. You can say, we think we've found where Satan used to live. They'll get the fuck outta here. You what? Huh? You could actually say you can be an archeologist and you can say, we believe we found the cross that Jesus was nailed on. But if you say, we think we found the box where Satan lived in, people would go, shut the fuck up. They wouldn't even talk to you. They wouldn't even take you serious for a second. There we go. This is crazy. Asshole thinks he found where the devil lives. Isn't that crazy? Satan is a force. Dude. It's not a person. It's not a real guy, man. Isn't he a fallen angel? I'm confused. I mean isn't he supposed to be. He used to be cool and they touch a shitty with God.

Speaker 5:          00:49:10       I'm sorry for going off on true blood. I'm on just on team Jacob and it kind of gets to me

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       brother. It's all right man. Again, Werewolf. So don't eat people. That's another thing. We want our Goddamn cake and we want to eat it too. We want all the sexy and none of the murder were willful. Stupid, right? Or Wolf or you know. One of the wolf man was stupid, but I bought it on DVD because I'm such a sucker for fucking horror movies. That's how much I love horror movies by mediocre horror movies and watch them on DVD fighting it. They put it on the background while I was writing nightmare on elm street. The new one. Did he it? No, no. Brian. Now like that actor though. That's that dude from the watchman. He's a the new Freddy Kruger. The dude who played a roar shark,

Speaker 5:          00:49:48       but why? What's wrong with the old Freddy Krueger Dan? You got an. You've got an actor just to look like Freddy Kruger. That's one character you can play until he is 98 because the older he isn't real life cut out the old freddy when he was the shit. There was no one. The problem is he became a joke or money. You want it too much money. Maybe because I mean seriously, the new guys just had makeup on to look like the old guy, you know, so there's not really any reason other than that. He looked a little different. Yeah, it looked a little creepier. I saw some pictures of it online. I didn't see the movie, but it looks a little new guys. Is he young? He said No. Well he's a little younger player himself. Was this like a preschool like they showed? No, no, I didn't

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       see it as that may have been tasked with Robert England in [inaudible] 75. I thought it was just a Redo. I just thought it just rebooted it. Maybe it is Robert England. Is he in bad shape now? I mean, I think I saw on the news he was upset about it was like, why didn't you just. You're saying, well, when you try to reboot something, you want to do a different actor. I mean how many goddamn times they got to do the hawk, you know, they did the Eric Bana One and they liked. What about, what about Captain America? Why aren't they doing it again? Or they're trying it again or I don't know. I know they did one back like what? Ten years ago. We're just one though because they did it like a couple of years after the old one. The Eric Bana came out and then like two or three years later, the fucking Edward Norton one came out.

Speaker 1:          00:51:05       When is wonder woman coming up to play wonder woman for Scarlett Johansson too? She's got some big titties though. She's got it. She's built like wonder woman. She's got that wonder ass. Just am a woman. Got to be tall. Yeah, but you can make a tall. Just put her with a bunch of short people. You put up with a bunch of short people and you give her high heels and that's how Tom Cruise rocks in his movies. You know, you just give a little lift and put them around people that are installing them. I wonder what the tallest guy has to start with. Tom Cruise. Probably Brad Pitt talked about how they had scenes where he. Tom Cruise had to like stand on planks and shit. Really try to make them appear to be the same height pit. Let's throwing them under the fucking throwing them under the bus, but they were talking about it in the interview and Brad Pitt was confirming it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:51       What about advantage Lily Lily doing that? Make that up. I might have made that up. Wonder woman, the girl from last kate from last. That'd be hot wonder woman. Yeah, she's pretty hot. Yeah, that would work. Megan Fox got to be wonder woman for sure. That no one. No one would question. It was interesting. An interesting conversation I read with Brad Pitt talking about Tom Cruise, about working on that movie together and something about. Yeah, yeah. Interview with the vampire is saying that he wished that something that he wished Tom Cruise wasn't so competitive. Something that you wished they could be better friends with. Tom Cruise was a more competitive, I wish I remember the quote, I hope I'm quoting it correctly, but uh, that's fascinating, you know, for sure because Brad Pitt was just coming up. That was the new guy just coming and Tom Cruise, like he, you know, he um, a campaign for that role, you know, he wanted that role.

Speaker 1:          00:52:37       A lot of people did not want him to play that vampire, you know, like the, and the, and rice people didn't take him seriously because her work was so serious. It was such good writing. And they thought Tom Cruise's, cheeseball actor who did top gun, all these stupid movies, you know, like this guy can't play lists.like this, like really intense vampire. But goddamn that little free connect. He pulled that shit off strong man. How good was that? A great movie. One of the greatest Goddamn vampire movie son. That's the real shit, you know? I mean, that's, those are scary monsters trapped in a person's body. They're a person, you know their, their, their soul is trapped in this scary monsters bought and it needs to eat people. That's that movie was bad ass. The little girl. Kristen dunst. How fucking creepy was she? That little chicken act man in the lost boys. Dude.

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       C'Mon Bram stroker's was the past. Come up with a good one, man. Gary Oldman, the motherfucker crushes. He's the motherfucker dude. He's that guy. He's the best. I think he, he gets into roles more than anybody. Does he like transforms like that when we played that fucking drug dealer and true romance. Oh good. Was that shit? Fuck yeah. That movie was the ghetto white guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To do with the dreadlocks. Have you been following Gary Coleman? Shit around lately. I've been. I've heard Anthony from opie and anthony say that he thought that Gary's wife killed them.

Speaker 3:          00:54:00       Well, she was trying to sell photos of him laying in bed uh, minutes before he died to tmz. Did you? That got photos and she sold them. Somebody bought them, but she was shopping around. She took a bunch of photos of him in bed. Like, I guess I'll fucked up right before she died. The nurses and doctors all solid and then she shopped around the photos and somebody just bought him I guess today or yesterday. How fucked up is that?

Speaker 5:          00:54:23       Oh my God. He must have had a real attorney deck. Huh? Sometimes short guys. It's like mini me sometimes. Short guys have big ass Dick. So it balances itself filed, but he probably was short. It doesn't, it, it didn't matter. Even if he had a big Dick, he's, he, you know, he's just got it helped. It would have helped the troyer is hanging in there. He's partying. Oh, that guy's depressed. As celebrity rehab show. That was horrendous. Celebrity Rehab. Troy, who was the biggest disaster of all time. Not bigger than Tom size. Oh my God dude. Because I only saw last season that is the best show on TV, celebrity rehab, but I haven't seen anything from troy was like pissing in his room. Like what did, he was crawling and celebrity rehab. What was it that was, um, that was uh, the one with the, uh, the time is a guy, right?

Speaker 5:          00:55:13       Like all the, all the level of celebrity celebrity house or someone's going to talk about it. It wasn't celebrity rehab. I saw what you're talking about. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was pissing all over himself. He's on this little buggy driving around a little buggy. Anyway, the point is, I don't think that guys that happy. I think he's a mess. Thank God we have webster. I follow him on twitter. I follow. I'm going to follow him today. What is it? Something like that. It's surreal life. Thank you everybody there. Yet@twitter.com, backslash tiny poop, I think. Yeah, man. I think that's, that's gotta be one of the greatest tortures in life. To be deformed. Trying to make fun of your deformity to make a living. You know, but think about that most. Most people, you look at someone with no arms, no legs, and really like our first instinct is like, damn, he's never going to be truly loved. He's not going to be desired. Like Q. Imagine being this person who is not desired. No one wants to sexually, you know, but really when we're all eventually going to be there because like, like I'm sure a hot 22 year old supermodel would rather fuck a gray maynard. Not Gray maynard. What's his name? Uh, what's that? The guy

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       with no arms, no legs. Oh, Kyle. Kyle. Kyle maynard. Some 90 year old man. You know what I mean? We're all good at. We're eventually going to get there. We're going to be just so it's how much people want to fuck you is the quality of your life, but that, that's the instinct. That's when you look at someone who's deformed or like, oh my God, no one's ever going to love them because girls are programmed to stay away sexually. Generally for burn victims. People who are amputees, we all are. Cripples. Yeah. We are the natural things that when we look at someone who's in a wheelchair, we think, fuck, that sucks. He's so young and he's fucked, but eventually we're going to get there. They just got it in advance. We're all going to walk through that fire unless we die early, but we're all going to be just as desired as that person, so it's something to think about. It's like really? What's life all about? You got to, we're all going to end up living half our lives at least where no one wants to fuck up. How are you? How are you going to handle things?

Speaker 1:          00:57:19       Bigger issue is that they don't have freedom. They're locked in a trap of a body and they never get to be a normal person. They're surrounded by other people that are normal. That's the torture man. It's not just whether or not people want to fuck them.

Speaker 3:          00:57:29       Yeah, but Eddie isn't in that like you're. You're going to get. It's hot in here. If you're going to get married though, you're again, 50 percent of that time, you're going to be with somebody. Maybe that doesn't want to be desired by most people either, but you both are undesirable together. I do.

Speaker 2:          00:57:41       You know, you go 20 years without having sex. Twenty years it desirable

Speaker 1:          00:57:45       bolting is, is as much of a, you know, as a factor with those people as why me? Why did I get fucked? Why am I the person with this terrible situation when, why can't I just be normal? I don't even. I mean sure, everybody wants people to love them, but I think what they really want is to just not be a mess, you know, to not be a physical mess, not be some sort of a genetic aberration, like the, you know, that's what the, the feeling of, the terrible feeling of pain is. You know, that's why these guys are all fucked up and angry. And Gary Coleman was angry as fuck before he died. You know, you always hear about stories about him yelling at people like he was. He had to work a regular job. Man. He was working as a security guard. Could you imagine people would just come up to him and fuck with them all day?

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       Yeah. The only reason I know that is because the Dave Chappelle sketch that he did on Gary Cole never saw. Oh, it's amazing. It's amazing. What did he do? He plays Gary Cole and so he plays the whole sketch on his knees. Oh, security and then some chicky chicks, chicks fighting and then they cut to like the chick biting into all bad. It's so bad. A Dahlan is security outfit and she's tossing. Gary called Raj. He throws in the minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:58:55       His show is so ridiculous. What was the one one, a sketch where he was fighting King Kong and hit King Kong or Godzilla. Godzilla with it

Speaker 2:          00:59:02       for cutting down. What the fuck was that? It was so ridiculous. Which was that sketch? I don't know, but remember when he. He has that sketch. It was the last season, the unfinished season where he goes back and. And he fucks with everybody who told him that the people that didn't believe in them, like club owners and all that stuff. He blew up like the old club that he was banned from any. He fucked up his old acting teacher who told him that he would never make it. So it's like a sketch where he goes back and then at the very end when he goes to the comedy club to blow up the comedy club, he blows it up and he walks out and there's like a, a lady walking across the street and he so on fire that he blew up at the club. The club owner was in a wheelchair and he threw him down the steps and let the place on fire. He takes his baby. This random ladies cross the street, takes Texas baby and punk kicks the baby. Right? Just out of nowhere. That's how to sketch Ed's like he was so happy that he got his revenge. He grabs this newborn baby kicks it. Nothing to do with the Scott.

Speaker 3:          01:00:02       Plus his show was so ridiculous. Remember the first episode of different strokes with Mr. Drummond took his two new boys, Willis and Arnold and got it. They all got in the hot tub together in a. we're all wearing tighty. Whities. No, it was really creepy as a kid and it's haunts me everyday when I. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:00:17       How weird is that? Different strokes. That was one of my favorite shots. It's gross that up. Todd was on fear factor and you know, he's, he's an angry dude. He's got A. I mean, he kept it together for the most part up until the part where uh, he, he lost, he got eliminated. He didn't even want to shake my hand and walked away. Wouldn't shake my hand. Yeah, he was upset. He thought it was some sort of conspiracy to make him lose. I don't, I don't exactly know what the fuck he had to do or what it was, what he was upset about. But he decided he didn't want to shake my hand. I'm like, wow, now you see why this dude, you know why his life is kind of fucked up like his, his automatic way of looking at things. It's like negative is automatic way of looking at things was like, someone's out to get me.

Speaker 1:          01:00:58       Someone's fucking with me. Oh, it ain't going to be fair. I'll, I see how it is. You know, it's like automatically like, dude, this fucking six people on the show, five of them have to be losers. You got, you're one of the five. Shit happens, man. You got to move on with your life, but not for him, man. He's an angry dude, which is kind of interesting, man. We were talking about this before, that toxo plasma. That's that cat tranquilizer or are they the cat parasite rather? Um, W, we, we talked about this on other shows before, but I watched a documentary yesterday. I read some articles about it and this thing called toxo plasma is a very common parasite that human beings get that completely alters our behavior and get this in Brazil, 66 percent of the population is infected with this toxo plasma.

Speaker 1:          01:01:41       And it does two things. It makes women submissive and it makes men reckless. Jerks makes men assholes, and it makes chicks submissive. It sounds like, um, like Brazil ecstasy, dude. No, no, no, not like that. It makes reckless. It makes them cope and shit, but no, no, no, no, no, it, it reprograms the mind. It's a parasite. This is the crazy thing. The parasite exists first in rats and what it does with rats is it gets rats convinced that rewires their, their sexual brain, the sexual aspect of the brain, and it gets them to be aroused and, and, and connect it to cat piss. So

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       these rats, it hijacks their sexual system so their sexual system all of a sudden become sexually aroused, like their testes swelled or ball swell because they smell cat piss. So these motherfuckers are searching after campus. So they're going towards where cats live be were cats mark their territory. They're, they're attracted to that and they're not afraid of cats anymore for whatever reason. So the cats obviously eat these rats because the rats are retarded. They stand there where the cats there with their balls all swollen and a heart on the Khakis. Some the cat eats the rats than the cat hangs around with people and we have to clean the cat shit. And when people clean the cat shit, sometimes people touch the cat shit. And if you touched the cat shit and it gets inside your bloodstream through either an open sore or maybe something in your food or maybe an open, you know, your touch your eyes or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:03:05       That shit gets in your body, man. And $60, million people in this country are infected by it and it affects your behavior. It changes your behavior and get it from low jobs. Maybe you could get it from reading. You can get it from touching raw meat as well. The um, yeah, it's 60 something million people in this country are affected by and they said a disproportion amount of people who die in motorcycle accidents. One of the things he was talking about was that they would test motorcycle accident victims for toxoplasma because the toxo plasma, this parasite that is, you know, this cat parasite makes people do nobody. Shit makes people wild. Cats used to rule the rural and maybe they used to like, this needs to be bigger than it is. And how. Maybe that's what the thing is. That's why we're getting rid of their cats.

Speaker 4:          01:03:48       Are you getting rid of your cats from? He's also maybe, but then he'd be a woman pyramids, but look, if you think about Brazilians, Brazilian men are notoriously aggressive. Brazilian women, notoriously submissive and sexual. You know, maybe that's what it is. I mean, 66 percent, two out of three women of childbearing age are infected with this parasite. I wonder about something to do with their assets if there's a connection. Do you think that's quite a bit there? They're asking. I mean there's a reason. There's a reason that 85 percent of all women between the ages of 18 and 48 have great assets in Rio. There's, there's got to be something and it could be kept paths. It could be the milk and why do cats, but they're up in the air when you tap on it because they want you to get that dirty shit.

Speaker 4:          01:04:32       Yeah, that's right. It's like, no, look, I got for you. That's an interesting thing that you said that because that's one of the things that this one of these articles were saying was that people who are normally polite people when they sneeze will sometimes inadvertently or unconsciously turned towards people and sneeze like they don't even realize why they're doing it. Like they. They almost have an instinct that turned towards people in Sneeze. I've seen people do it before. Wow. Where they go like this, like you're standing, you're hearing, you have like your body is trying to get you to fucking blow a sneeze on somebody. This is the theory. How many cats do you have? Any possible? If you think about what it does to cats and what it does to people, it's very possible that some viruses could try to get you to be attracted to people when they expel how many cats you have. I have to, but

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       Joey Diaz has 10 or nine. Fuck Cock sucker stopped bringing up my cats. Got a good amount. Y'all need to get tested. So here's the thing. I'm being real here. Oh totally, dude. If you think about that, if, if, if your cat has ever been outside and you think your cat may have eaten a rat, you know my cats, I've never been outside of Brazil. They leave those cats out a little bit. What's the curator anyway? You're fucked. You might have to change the cat box with condoms. I. No, that's not a cure. What would keep you from infecting other cats from getting in your poor Cuba. That's a preventive method. Once you get it. I don't think you could do anything about it. It's just a water bottle that you spray yourself with. Like, you know, it's fascinating. We think about that your whole life could get hijacked, like some parasite could literally take over your body and talk to your body and to living a totally different life.

Speaker 5:          01:06:13       And what the doctor was talking about this, the scientists Soplasky I believe his name is. What he was talking about was that the idea of free will is really an illusion. Like there's a bunch of mitigating factors that caused you to move in one direction or another and it makes certain decisions. You know? And so the thing that you have complete free will, is kind of silly if you go on Amazon, there's a urine detector for cat urine and if you ever buy it, just be worn. It doesn't just detect urine. It detects a lot of gross shit. So, uh, it's kind of cool. What I like calm, like if you put it on your bed, it's just like every, all this shit comes up. It's pretty scary dude. But you've seen those inside edition things where they go to hotel rooms and check the covers.

Speaker 5:          01:06:54       Oh Dude, dude. Just judges all over the covers. It's like a Goddamn Jackson pollock painting. Every time you walk into a room with a black light, just loads everywhere. Loads all the floor loads on the wall. You'll find loads everywhere. I have, I've several times I've pulled out a load and just just let it drip on the fucking carpet in a hotel. Have you ever thrown your just build in? Might have. I'm just not thinking about it. I'm not judging. You might have for sure, but I can't remember any. Do you ever throw your come on the wall at a hotel room? No, never try it. It's so awesome. Just take a look. Just throw it on the wall. Spiderman is wrong with you. Never done that to it. That is the nastiest fluid. It's really pretty much the same thing as it's not, you know, phlegm, but the fact that it also can make babies, you know, it just makes it ultra nasty. It's weird how some girls love the taste of it and some girls don't get to choose between eating a dude's snot and neat and dudes load for sure. You're going to go with snot as chicks. Say if a guy's got a gun to your head and you're either going to eat this load, are you gonna? Eat some snow. Like all right, I'll eat your stock out of not. It's just rude, but what if this is not what's coming from the guy's Dick? Awesome.

Speaker 5:          01:08:15       That doesn't even make sense. Somehow they put it in their ultimate world. Pack out like a pastry, right? Brendan? Come from a tick or not from a dick. Which one would you take? One of those pastry things called let's pastry scribes off cook measure. You could do that stuff, stuff so on. Snow up your load of your Dick like that and then squeeze it out. Dick spit spit out like that one. I'm going to use that. Have you guys been to six flags lately? No, I just have. I just found out I went. It was like I live like 15 miles away from it, so I got a season pass to the pool when stuff. Fifteen months. It's amazing though if you go on the rides during the day i. it's amazing like how like the people that work there roller, like if you go on the highest biggest roller coaster, you get the best employees I guess at work, at six flags.

Speaker 5:          01:09:09       But if you go on like that one boat that just rocks up and down. You obviously have the worst employees. I had one guy and I swear to God I'm. He might be like mentally handicapped by that, so I don't want, you know, but he's literally like, like, like seriously he's operating the operating the right. Like I don't even, like I looked at him, I'm like, can I put my water bottle on the ground here? And he was like, glassy stare. Like he had no idea he was even there and I recorded. He's operating the ride. Yeah. Every will have a video of this video but have his voice of hope of us getting on the ride. Oh my God. And I'll play through the second year. But it. By the way, Ben, have you been on the roller coaster? If they've been playing or that they have out nowadays?

Speaker 5:          01:09:51       I will never do that extra. It's not like. It's not like a regular rollercoaster around where you see where you're going. You see the loops, they flip you upside down, you're upside down, you're going bash. Start out backwards. It's fucking hard. Rough all. Yeah. You guys, there's no way you can't be sued. My toes were curling. Yeah. That's the one that does like five different, like five dimensions or whatever they say. Is that the one you're talking about where it's like spins up and down? Why you're going upside down. Got the video. Here it is. Alright. Explain this again for people just tuning. All right, this is the swing ride where you get on like you know, like to get on the ride and this is the guy that knows a guy operating the Rod. That was really dumb. Scary. I'm very scared though right now. Listen.

Speaker 5:          01:11:11       Oh my God. It's pretty incredible. That's insane. That guy is the guy who's operating this fucking death machines and I, like I had said, I had said something to him and I had said something to him and like he looked at me right in the eye, but it was like glass. It was like, wow, this guy is not like this murder guy. I mean, you know, maybe the dude is super responsible just because he has this tremendous speech impediment. Maybe he's a super responsible super conscientious guy. May have ever thought maybe it was death. Maybe you can't hear people screaming to stop the ride. That can't be good if you're. The fucking dude has got the hand on the ride button. Do that. Ride was nothing. Babies go on those lines. I like. It's like a merry go round with swings. What was it? Which one was it?

Speaker 5:          01:11:58       That one? That one is the one we're just spinning in a circle, which is swings, but, but still, I mean it's a ride, you know, and then. Okay. So you still think it's too dangerous for retarded. It's something. Where's that happened? Was, do you think he got it? What do you think was wrong with him? I think he was special. Maybe special, special, special Ed. Special Olympics. There's no way. There's no way magic amount would hire a retard. Okay. But with what? If there's, there's, there's all sorts of levels of impairment that human being suffer. Maybe he passed the test, like with colors and stuff. Is there a test? Probably. What do you think the test is? Like? Colors and shapes and those shapes that you put in, like the circles. That's why it seems like the test wouldn't be there. You know, the odds of getting killed in one of those accidents is very, very slim. But what had happens, God town that must suck. You know, you put yourself on some wacky rollercoaster, flips you around, you wind up dying. He imagine hanging out with a dude, we got to get a depth dude and on crystal meth where he just can't shut up, shut up. He's got so many stories to tell you.

Speaker 5:          01:12:59       By the way, that guy was not deaf because when I asked him that question, he turned around when I asked him about the water bottle, it's way hollow, so he's not, he wasn't deaf. So you think he maybe had some sort of autism or something like that? Maybe, but impediment for sure. Right. How ridiculous is that on another ride? Again, it wasn't like the biggest, right was like a, it was called the Ninja, which is a rollercoaster, but uh, they were going to check everybody's like straps and stuff and the guy just like, you see them checking it. Then he goes to mind. You just touch it. Like he just tapped it. I'm like, you weren't even lifting or any that, you just touched it. Just touching. It does not check anything, you know, I think I was like, did he just touch it? Know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          01:13:41       Like how they lived it. They assume that it's, it can be loose and you can go flying out. Yeah, and it would have fucking scary way to die. That must be. And then there was this like this guy that like he kept on Splat, like we're waiting in line for like a raft ride and it was really hot and so every couple minutes he would like splash. Everybody that's in line with water. Like he was the lifeguard. Now he's the one that pushed you down over the side in this raft for every couple minutes who like splash you. And he kept them like fucking kicking water in my face. So when I got up there I just started

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       fucking kicking water back at him and he goes and he blew the whistle. Go take. We've got a problem here. And I'm like, wait, I can't splash you. You just got done fucking splashing me for 15 minutes. So now I'm feeling like I'm getting in fights with people that are here to make sure I'm part of the ride. That he splashes you. No, no, no. This is while we're waiting in line and he just being a dick, he's just being a ticket, like spraying people with water and he was doing it like three. He hit probably hit me like three or five times. While. Did you ask him to stop? No, everyone. Everyone aligned was like, what the fuck? Stop. You know, like there was like parents and stuff and kids and the kids were. The kids were liking it, but you know, it's like, hey, you're the kids will login.

Speaker 4:          01:14:45       Yeah, but you know, I splashed them back because like, hey, here's this thing that you have to consider back to the subject of parasites when you're at those water parks, man, you have to be real careful of swallowing that water. That water is funky as fuck dude. I saw and heard in the water. Oh do no doubt there. There's like a pool, like a wave pool and then they have like the small, like pool for just like kids and stuff like that. I know a woman who was a nurse and her daughter went to one of those parks, swallow some water and got horribly sick and became paralyzed. She got some sort of terrible infection. She was deathly ill and she wound up with a limited use of her legs. Man. Wow. These serious infections can fuck with your. Your whole system. That's horrible infection.

Speaker 4:          01:15:31       You know Cole Escovedo, you know, call us, can veto. He had staff and he was paralyzed. Man. He almost couldn't walk again. It took him like over a year to recover from that shit. You can get an infection, dude. That just wrecks your whole life and those water parks are prime. That water is not clean at all. That water is death. You swallow a mouthful. That water, like if you go to a water park with your kids, you got to be real upfront with them about this. You've got to say, you cannot take this water in your mouth. This is bad. Dangerous for real. It sounds ridiculous, but you really shouldn't take your kids on those slides. Are Those water rides? They get a mouthful of that shit. Your little four year old who doesn't know any better. They could get fucking deathly ill. They could die. Did you know you're not supposed to swallow even eight drop of toothpastes.

Speaker 4:          01:16:18       Yeah. Toothpaste has. Fluoride is poisonous. Yeah. Fluoride is bad for you. I used to as a kid when I was like drunk driving. I'll keep toothpaste in my car now like put it in my mouth and switching between mouth and swallow it dying now. That's why you're rotting out from the inside. That's why you got that cat piss gone. It's fighting the cat piss dude. It's no joke, man. Fluoride is scary shit. Yeah. That's the reason why it kills everything in the water and everything in your mouth. It just seems like you should tell people that, hey, this thing that you put in your mouth don't swallow it. Yeah. No one ever told me that, that I buy hippie toothpaste. I buy that uncle Tom's of Maine stuff. It doesn't have any anything or Tom's of Maine. Uncle Tom. I made him uncle Tom Guide us to eat TV Guy TV guy. I would send out pieces of paper I call complete

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       page, but I would snack on little pieces of it. Are you fucking serious? Seriously. He had like this with this. I guess I was mineral deficient or something and needed fiber or something. I see the TV guide. I sleep buggers. You guys. Everyone needs to eat burgers, right? No, it wasn't. I was in the building with dirt and grass. I like taking. I like taking like a real wet sloppy booker. And did you just keep rolling it? Working, getting your finger until a solid ball, like making bread. I know what I mean. Fighting back at dry heave. I used to eat grass so much time ago to grasp so much as a kid that now I could get wheat grass juice and I love the taste of wheat grass just because I used to eat so much grass as a kid. Oh, I fucked up Jamba juice on me to do this, but there's this girl, she.

Speaker 5:          01:17:58       She got me my wheat grass juice and she goes, do you want to Orange chaser with it? And I go, no, I'm okay. I'm like, oh, this stuff is nasty, and I downed it and she goes, she goes, do you think it's nasty? I love the taste. I go, oh, that's because you're a cow. Oh, you really did mean that though. What? Are you a cow pig? No, she wasn't because every girl. But if it was a dude, you know, we were joking around before that, you know, it was all friendly talk and I just totally didn't. You can't call it girl cow. You could tell it to cow like of a guy said, you know, Oh, I love to taste sweet grass. Like what are you a fucking cow? Like joking around with them. Like as long as you're laughing and smiling it will be all fun.

Speaker 5:          01:18:41       But with a girl you can never call her cow. I could call you a cow eating grass. I'm like, what? Are you a fucking cow? Or You could call a white guy. Like if he's a beast, motherfuckers a gorilla gorilla all the time. Yeah. You can't say that about a black. They get mad. Do you guys saying. What are we saying? How would they get mad? What the fuck, Brian even bringing it up. I totally right after it came out of my mouth. I wanted to take it back, but then I told him I want to address it. I didn't want to. I don't know. I really don't mean you're a cow. I was just a. It was a terrible idea to joke that I wasn't thinking. I just set it and then after this kate my mouth, I was like, oh you dick, but it didn't mean to be a dick.

Speaker 5:          01:19:20       So I'm in this new part of our relationship where when I fart, I can't say it's a fart yet. So how do you get to that part of the relationship where you could just be like, oh, I farted because I'm so tired of blaming. Don't go there. It'll kill everything. Be Honest. Is the sex drive exactly where it was was from the. From the beginning to the way it is now. Same thing. Yeah, absolutely. Has tapered off at all for good reasons. The other day it was so bad. I had no excuses. I couldn't say the cat did because I've said it so many times. Luckily she didn't say a word, you know, you should just ignore it. No, just, you know, in the middle of the night while you're sleeping, punch her in the nose and then her nose will swell up. She'll get a deviated septum and it makes it much harder to smell farts. Flirting

Speaker 4:          01:20:07       in your sleep and then you, you ever fired so loud, you wake up in your sleep. You okay to Fart in front of your girl? I don't. Just out of respect. Do you leave the room or do you have like if she walks in, like she'll walk into my office. I'm like, you better back the fuck up. I just farted in front of extent. I wonder if Fart in front of me. This is what I'm thinking is there's times where I have to fart really, really bad, but I'll just hold that motherfucker and then I fall asleep. Is there any way you hold it while you're still asleep? No. No, no, no way. I had an ex girlfriend wake me up because she was farting. She farted it so loud. It woke me up and I was like, what the fuck did I hear? I was like looking her ass.

Speaker 4:          01:20:43       And then a second one came out loud one and then she woke up. She was like, what happened? I go, yeah, what happened? Then I went back to see, you know, those vacuums that they have at the car wash places, you know what I mean? If they'd have one right by your bed. So you just kinda like a smoke smoking going. You'd always have to think about it getting stuck to your ass. When I did, what I did last night is I got off the Internet is that you take a little bit of Vicks Vapor Rub and put around your asshole. So even if it does far, just much like Vick's vapor rub. So the Internet got a tip to do that. Yeah. You tried that and your asshole is going to light on fire. That's terrible advice to put capsaicin. Rubbing your butthole is like open source.

Speaker 4:          01:21:27       It's like an open wound, you know, it's super, super open skin. It's incredible airtight. It is because you know there's like a gigantic explosion like right there at the end of year you can smell it, so what can you do besides vapor? Rub that with you, like if you rub like shaving cream or alcohol, aftershave on your hands. It never bothers you at all, but if you rub that shit on your balls, it's going to fucking hurt. And your balls dip your Dick in it. If you dip your Dick and that stuff and touches like that soft tissue, you put that around your asshole. What about just some bubble gum or something? Just plug it up with some bubble gum before you go to bed. Put roses around it like glue roses around until took us through a rose filter. Some lemon juice. Maybe that's what you could do. Make a filter out of roses like a diaphragm as little stickies on it on the side, and just stick it right to your butthole. So it's like a filter. So when you fart, it goes through an snl sketch like maybe 15 years ago with commercial parody where they go now you can, you know. No more embarrassing farts. What are they? Take a big horn and he stuck a big horn in your ass and then when you were at park, that'd be an electronic voice that said, how bout them doctor?

Speaker 4:          01:22:32       That was all about them dodgers and then it did filter out your farts smell. It is pretty incredible when you think about all the technology that we have that we have zero invested in farts. We have nothing invested in cleaning up the smell of forest. There's no product farts or like a normal part of everyone's day and yet there's no technology that exists to try to deal with. Be like a Fart sucker built inside the seat cushion where you sit down and it's like right there and you could secretly just press that button. Why don't they have writers? They have a filter on the top of my litter box so that I don't smell my cat's shit. There's a charcoal filter. Why don't they make filters for your underwear if you like. If you like to eat a lot of Mexican food or if you're going out drinking and you know you're gonna be farting, why don't they have some filters?

Speaker 4:          01:23:23       That's a good idea. Like a fart. Kotex? Yeah, exactly. Like the FARC, Kotex build into your underwear. Your Saturday night party in short and he your Saturday night party and underwear and they have built in charcoal filter in there to sent it like strawberries or something like that. Like a butt plug to take because you got to fuck with the noise through. The noise is going to happen, so you need to stick something in your ass like maybe a couple inches and then it just got something real list. The knowledge will be way muffled if you've got a Kotex over your bundle. How much? Not a real loud one. Right? Well, I'll tell you what, Tate Fletcher would be their fucking product management guy. He'd be the one to test to see the efficacy of their individuals. Filters. Sounds, sounds with a clipboard like organizing. He's like head of the science team, but it's and it's all built around his gas.

Speaker 4:          01:24:17       Put the stethoscope notice stomach to try to determine whether that is ready to fart. Fart. No, it's hot as fuck. It's hot. I got to my ac broke and the side of the house. I got to get it fixed. Get some Mexicans to fix that. Hey, what the fuck again? With the Mexicans? Man. Jesus. So speaking of Mexicans, the Gulf of Mexico, the fucking oil spill, they've just determined that the oil is coming out in multiple locations. They've just confirmed that it's not just this one spot. So even if they dig this relief, well it's still might be fucked because the oil is coming out from all these different spots like very far away from each other. It's a fucking mess. Dude. Fucked up Cancun yet. I don't know. Once it goes around the Florida and goes up the code, that's crazy because I mean just think myrtle beach, Florida, beaches, all that shit's not going to get a swim.

Speaker 4:          01:25:04       Then beach on the east coast, all those beaches of Jack duty might go to England. Yeah. It's the whole thing. It's so incredible that they don't have a way to stop the oil, that they're allowed to make these things and not have fail safes. You would think there would be a bunch of set failsafes if there's a rupture in this line. We shut it off here. There's a rupture here. We shut it off here. This way we can absolutely ensure that will be no pollution comes out of this. Well, animals are going to evolve and thrive in the oil.

Speaker 4:          01:25:32       Probably not going to happen. What's probably gonna happen, we may be millions of years from now if I kept talking to what's going to happen to kill all these animals off. Oh, make belief. Mon Southern Fire Monster. Some fucking dragon that eats the oil and that stores in like a special gland has got rocks in the back of his throat and so it sparks up the flame to how many dragons are there an ancient cultures and where the fuck that come from dragons. Does that still exist? Man? I went to the zoo and some of these lizard things, those looked like fucking like Komodo dragons. That shit's crazy. If you just have you seen it? Yeah. I think Komodo dragons were just like, you know, dwarfs of the big old relative to Chinese dragon came from someone saw like a crocodile or a Komodo Dragon. I just drew it in the story.

Speaker 4:          01:26:18       Went back and forth, rawlings being misinterpreted. You know, like when you were saying that dude, like there's drama that people tales and stuff. That's just some gay guy that depth. Some dude was drawing, you know, like he was dressed up as a dragon or it could have been like, you know, the national enquirer for 6,000 years ago. They were just making shit up. Exactly. Yeah. That's possible. Okay. If you had to believe in one. Dragons are vampires attitudes. One Dragon Dragon's dude. Vampires are so stupid to think about that. Think about that. I believe. Will. Where will this be for bleeding? Cool Dragon? No, I believe vampires before. I believe where will, because I've seen vampires. What could it be is it could be some sort of a parasite, something that hijacks your system, but vampires is supposed to be dead and you can't. But what if the parasite hijacks your, your aging system too and keeps you alive, but it makes you feast on blood.

Speaker 4:          01:27:08       It could be just the idea of a blood sucking person, a person that lives off blood that a parasite could trick you into doing that. That is way more possible than a werewolf. Some of the changes back and forth to another animal. And then back again. That's ridiculous. So you're saying that Sun can burn people during the day? No, but I can't say that if they, if they had some sort of a crazy, a blood problem, you know where they may be in intensely anemic, they might have like a real aversion to sun. They might lose the pigment in their eyes. It's possible, man, if you think you see the shit that parasites do do to different insects, different caterpillars and bugs and ants and all sorts of different things. Their whole bodies get hijacked by parasites, completely rewires their entire system. It happens to frogs and happens to lizards.

Speaker 4:          01:27:54       So many different animals exist in the animal kingdom and it just recently discovering new parasites that hijack new hosts caused them to do. Let's get this straight. The cat parasites make women more horny. It makes women more submissive. It makes. I mean, there's all sorts of interpretation of what, how it exactly affects them, but it seems to make men and women the opposite makes men more aggressive. Women. They going crazy guy with a beard down, calm down. Brazilian women aren't calm. Well then that doesn't make sense because they're wild too, and they have to deal with all those wild men so it makes them extra wire. What are you saying, man? This is all based off the research guy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Toxo toxo plasma is a very well established overtaking. No, no, no. This. No, no.

Speaker 4:          01:28:41       It's not. This says 6 million people or or 60 million people rather than America habit. This is the CDC there. If you look online, there's many different studies, many different ports, many different scientists working on this. Toxo plasma is a very real parasite. That is his actual d actually detectable and people that they know is responsible in part or connected in part to uh, all sorts of different psychological ailments. Yeah, but the part that it. Schizophrenia making girls submissive. That part of this whole. I know one guy saying this. No, it's a bunch of. It would also train. It changes all sorts of animals. I said it changes. Rats, makes them attracted. Cat piss changes. Men makes them assholes. Makes him reckless. It's really fascinating stuff. And when you research and you think about how many different parasites might exist that we don't even buy my shit don't work.

Speaker 4:          01:29:38       Check, check, check, check, check, check. Okay. How much was out just for 20 seconds talking about campus anyway. We know. We know that these parasites exist and we know that these parasites affect people and if we know there's just a couple of them, how do we not know that there's a bunch more that we haven't detected yet? What about use as a kid? He used to eat those green weeds with a yellow flower on the top. Did you ever eat those? Dogs would piss on them. Dogs a piano, um, and I would eat them. Oh, dandelions. The green stocks with a yellow flower at the Dandelion. Dandelions you eat, eat the grass. Dogs piss on them all the time. I got take a piss is good for you. Oh Man. You have some sort of crazy pissed parasite. Have you ever thought about that? How crazy that is though, that if there really is a, an animal parasite that makes people like aggressive, it makes women's submissive. Like that is Brazil. Like dudes are super aggressive cocaine that makes cocaine, makes women's summit, so it makes them drop to their knees immediately. That's just because they need that. They're just happy to get that coke or coke. Makes them immediately submissive. I think it's cooked. Definitely. Remember Larry used to have coke around just anybody spot. No one knows who larry is. The cable guy.

Speaker 4:          01:31:11       That's one thing I've never fuck with and I'm very glad I never tried that shit. Never fucked with it. I knew too many people that had real problems with it. I've done coke maybe five times in my whole life. Maybe three to five times sucks. Scary pussies. They say you got to get that Rockstar Cook. That's what a Tom Sawyer from cobb's in San Francisco. He's always saying you got to get that Rockstar Coke Shit. I read somewhere. Something about coke. How there's bad coke going around now that like will eat your skin. Like it has some kind of fucking chemical in it that just starts burning your skin. Fuck, I don't know. I ain't got a google list now. Bad cocaine. What was it? What you were telling me about tylenol? What the fuck is going on with? So there was, if you try to get tylenol right now, I guess there's this huge tylenol like where they pulled it from the store shelves and what's crazy is that I did some research on it and it seems like a. So they

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       did all these like things where they went to the factories were tylenol is made and they found a like, like a bacteria inside tylenol. They found like the chemicals that were being made to make tunnel were off. Like there was too much of one chemical and not enough of another chemical. So it could possibly have got, you know, made kid's sick and so they, they pulled off tylenol off the shelves I guess, but then the other day a monitor, there was this report that came out, there was this report that came out that, that Johnson and Johnson, the company that owns tylenol or whatever, hired this third party company from San Diego to act like customers and then go into grocery stores and buy all this one product off the shelf. Like they're doing a phantom recall, meaning they didn't want to tell anybody or anyone to know.

Speaker 3:          01:32:46       So they hired a company to go into grocery stores, into pharmacies to take this product off your shelf. And then they got caught and then a month later they, they recalled, uh, this other drug. It's just like Tylenol, I forget the name of it, but it was like another one and they're like kids tylenol or something like that. How much have you looked into this? Seriously? It was like a half hour today. I just read around today, but a tylenol Johnson Johnson was supposed to give over to the FDA like this report about their findings and stuff like that and they missed the deadline. I think the deadline was yesterday or two days ago. They missed the deadlines is something might be up at Tylenol, so if you have any tylenol from 2008, you might want to go check it out, throw it away or do whatever you have to do. Because there was another report I was reading as say something like there was 30 deaths related to tylenol in the last two years and they don't know if that's connected or not either. So I don't know. Google search, tylenol recall. There's some crazy shit going on with some tylenol right now. Wow. They're saying that the pharmacist that we were at today said that there might not be tying on until 2011.

Speaker 5:          01:33:45       Damn. Who is fuck. Who's who got in trouble for cyanide? They're saying there's potential criminal charges and indictments. Yeah, that's what they're saying about tylenol. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:33:55       and it's crazy because you pay extra for Tylenol, you know, your, your tunnels, like more expensive than like the average brand. Right. And you would think that they would have their shit together a little bit better than fucking

Speaker 5:          01:34:05       buffering first. Toyota. Now this, what's next fucking cup of color. Imagine that. Well, as the economy starts to fuck up, as people start to make less and less money, you're gonna see more and more problems. I'm sure less and less research is going to be done less and less, you know, fail safe measures. Did you watch the last comic standing last night? No. No, I gave up on that show a long time ago. I didn't watch it, but I heard it was okay. Wow. Fucking fascinating. Yeah. Yeah. Last comic standing, man, I, I just don't like the fact that they make them sit in a room and do standup comedy for three people. You know, that to me it's just like what? That's how they're going to audition. They're going to stand in front of three people and one of them was going to try to pretend that there Simon, is that what happens ones runs really mean. Is that how they do it? If you got a tremendous migraine headache and you had, you only had two things, tylenol

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       or cocaine, what would you do? You trust cocaine that you don't even know where it came from. It could come from some fucking greasy immigrant. He going to trust cocaine for a nice American name brand like Tylenol, so they made a few mistakes. Brian, how many good pills they put out? Huh? Millions and millions and millions of people all across the world have had relieved headaches because of tylenol and you want to hate because they fucked up a little bit here and there. That's deep. Come on, man. That's deep. Tylenol doesn't get you laid cocaine does. Wow. Just got a good point for your baby. If you crush up tylenol, the powder like joey does, that'll get you laid. The girls that you can only fucked because you're giving them coke. You really shouldn't fuck them. What models know the fucking people don't really want to fuck you.

Speaker 4:          01:35:46       That's what I'm saying is, you know they fucked the tylenol. You should only fucked girls who want to fuck you. You shouldn't fuck girls who want to fuck you for coke. I mean you got to do what you gotta do it. That's the only way you can get laid. I understand your position. I got cocaine or got my personality. Which one do you want? Maybe if you have two possibilities. One fucking girls who actually wanna fuck you. And two fucking girls that you can only fuck because you give them drugs. I would say go with number one. Yeah, right? Yeah. Everybody wants the person who's fucking them to like the fuck them. Nobody wants to be fucking some cooked up checkers. She's got her half an eye on the nightstand at all times. Looking over at that mirror while you're banging her. Just wants another line.

Speaker 4:          01:36:21       Yeah, but what if you're noise with the chick? You just want her to fuck out, but you want to drop it. Load first. Then coax. Perfect. I guess, but doesn't she want more coke? There isn't that. The thing about coke is never get rid of them. There'll be cool for like two hours. You can. You give them a little bit and they'll think it's enough. You just give them the token. Tell them to leave with some coke and you're telling Yo meet him at the club and you got more coke. You're gonna. Bring all the coke. Who has. Who has more aspirin stories that joey did. Fucking crushed up aspirin. Tell us a joey story. Let me tell you something. There was this one time. This chick was like, I just need to get a line. Like I just need to get my dick sucked.

Speaker 4:          01:36:57       What a coincidence. So we go back to my place. I'm telling US pitch. I got the best fucking coke ever. This shit's coming straight from Pablo Escobar. He deliberated himself. It came over on a fucking donkey with some bread and a fact pack of coke. Hold on honey. I'm going to get it. I'll be right back. I went into the bathroom. I started fucking chopping up all these different pieces of fight of his fight up and fucking be fucking talcum powder and shit. I laid a couple of lines. I stuck it in her mouth. I shot off a load before she even knew what hit her. I was gone. You know what I'm saying, Dawg?

Speaker 4:          01:37:30       Fuck. Oh Shit. We gotta get out of here. I realized the cops are coming at noon. Run. I got to the fucking front. I got in my car. I told her take a left at the light. I'll meet you down the street. I took a right fuck her. I'm gone. I got on the freeway. Got Off the first exit. Fuck you. I when away to whip ponies dead. Nice. That's a good job. Joey Diaz and pressure like such a good impression. Okay. Review reviews. Joey. Joey, what do you think about this whole, uh, a cat piss thing? The parents. That's a soft spot in my heart. You know, I got cats, you know, I love him to death. But the bottom line is I'm an asshole and I live with a bunch of fucking cats. I think he's probably got it totally, totally, totally, totally brings in cats from outside.

Speaker 4:          01:38:24       Yeah. He brings in like monster cats. Like remember he was always talking about the Samurai that, that at the big scars all over his face. That's a wild tomcat. He is one of the guys that's a grown adult that subscribes to cat fancy magazine that actually keeps that magazine in business, which I can't believe cat. Fancy still has a drive to cat. Fancy. Yeah. But then you get like real magazine, so you know, like whatever Time magazine or whatever that they're hurting because of the economy by yet. Cat Fancy. Julia would freak out if we wouldn't watch that DVD and I don't think you'd read that article. You'd have to show them a documentary on the cat parasite. Have to be a documentary. Are you concerned at all about the oil spill or anything? How does that affect your life? Directly effects me because I think it's going to be. Oh, oh. I was like, where the fuck's this? You listen to any Bravo look at me. Do I look like a look like I get in the fucking ocean and sharks? What am I fucking Cock sucker. Listen, this is what I'm going to do. I'm gonna. Walk down to the weed store. I'm going to roll a joint. Say a prayer to the mother. Fucking clean this shit up. If not, I guess I'm not going swimming.

Speaker 4:          01:39:33       What did he say? What the fuck? I got enough problems in my own life. Give a fuck about a greasy Pelican. You got oil on you. You Fuck? Oh Man. Oh Shit. Fly Away motherfucker. You got wings. You're gonna. Sit there and let the oil hit Ya. Fuck you. You finally got texting about six months ago. You're by. You're busting my balls that he probably. You think about the iphone and the camera and all that shit. You're going to go into the iphone now. I do. You think Julie would go into the iphone but I don't know. You tell me he wants an iphone back. Listen, no, he's too old school for that. Now he wants to iphone. He just got a iphone. Uh, you know, like one of those phones that are acting like the iphone, he did sprint, iphone, some sprint, sprint. He was supposed to be here.

Speaker 4:          01:40:18       This with Joe. We're going to get an iphone. He would. Eddie Bravo. Listen to me. I'm old school. I barely, barely get on that fucking thing to text to you. Me, you think I'm going to get there and we'll get a fucking do apps together. Oh, let's play donkey Kong will fucking come on. Get online with my laptop through your asshole. And you're gonna fucking connected with a USB cable. I don't need all this nonsense in my life. I don't need all this aggravation to the weed store. I'm going to roll a joint. Walk down to the fucking store. Alright. I'm not hurting nobody. I'm not bothering nobody. Did you? Did your. We'd start close. No, no. My closing. They're closer. A bunch because they're too close to churches. Parks or schools. You have to be within a certain feet from a church. A Parker school.

Speaker 4:          01:41:07       I don't know how many it is, but it's like a thousand or some shit, which is pretty pretty far. I checked all my places and none of them are closing so that you can't be near a park because that's where all the illegal dealers. It's almost like the illegal dealers got in on the action. Yeah, probably at the top of the weed movement. And like, especially the guys that own the most successful at dispensary's, I think they'd like these stores that have been rated guys fuck up when they're going against the, uh, the regulations is we had a conversation with a, a idleman because we got our, uh, you're right, there is radio, the um, uh, the, you know, the, the, uh, the dog, he went to jail for it and an item and was talking about the November election and were like, you know, if this stuff becomes legal in November, like, what are you going to do?

Speaker 4:          01:42:00       You're not going to be able to give out prescriptions anymore. And he's like, yeah, well it's actually kind of a dilemma for me. Like, wait a minute, what are we doing? If that guy, if we became legal, his whole business shuts down. What the fuck is you do? Then that's a tricky situation for a week, Dr. man, it's gonna be wild. If it gets through though, if it gets through in California and it becomes absolutely legal, it's gonna be fucking crazy. It's going to really change the culture here because people realize how much has changed the culture since medical marijuana became legal, but that's just the beginning man. When when it becomes legal legal, when it comes, you know a personal use issue when you just have to be over 21, you just go to the fucking corner drugstore and they're selling weed or selling weed everywhere.

Speaker 4:          01:42:44       It's going to change things, man. They're going to start selling weed at bars. They're going to have weed, smoking sections at bars for sure. They'll have like a back patio where you can smoke weed. It's gonna be nuts when they allow you to buy a joint at a movie theater, like at the arc light smoke because they have like a movie theater designated with a bar. You have to be 21 to get into this theater at the top. They're going to have a weed there. That's what. That's what the problem is. You can't even smoke cigarettes indoors because it's a personal. It's other people's health that you get to choose. You get to choose, you get to choose. They don't let that. Don't let that happen in. In California, you can't even smoke at a bar. It's not even an option. You have to go to a cigar bar. I, I belong to a cigar bar in beverly hills and you go there. Yeah, but so god bars like a bunch of stuffy, rich dudes and it's got a thousand dollars a year. Something like that. Maybe more. That's the gayest thing I've ever heard. You take a failed cigar bar. The licensing for smoke Brian and convert it into weed barn. I don't know. I wonder how many cigar bars there are a bunch of cigar stores. Alicia, small right next to the Improv. This one vending everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       That's what you would have. Like a store that lets you smoke there

Speaker 6:          01:43:55       and in Canada they got spots. It's weird because in Canada you can't buy the weed there if you're going to smoke, but they have places where you can smoke weed. You've got to bring your own shit in Vancouver, Vancouver, and in Toronto there's places where the bottom floor is a restaurant and like a snack bar cafe. And then you rent these rooms. There's rooms like as big as this giant screen tv, xbox, playstation, dvds, couches.

Speaker 1:          01:44:22       Well, you know, who's taken us coover. We're going to Vancouver this weekend by the way. Yeah, we Friday night. Um, if you want to come, I'm hanging out with Adam score. Gee, the guy who produced the union and uh, we're gonna do another documentary together and one of the things that we're going to do is dispel a lot of the myths about people being lazy and uh, you know, marijuana smokers being lazy and how much propaganda has been distributed to people about marijuana making you lazy. And one of the things I want to do is feature your school and feature, you know, you teaching and you how many times you've done this, where you teach class, you go, how many guys are high, like 30 dudes who raise their hands. And I don't think I've, I've taught a night class, not stone. They classes too. I go and stone too, but I used to not get high for the day classes, but night class, I mean my classes are at 8:30 at night.

Speaker 1:          01:45:13       There's, there's no way I'm going to get to that class and not be stone, you know? Yeah. And you know, there was one of the things that came up in the UFC q and a. They asked me about weed and about whether or not I think weed is an enhancer, a physical enhancement, you know, whether or not I think that it's a performance enhancer and this guy said that he thinks it is and he was talking about him doing Jujitsu and I said, I agree. I think it is. I go, I feel like when I'm. When I'm stoned and I did Jujitsu, I feel like I focus more. I can see it clearly. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm more, I have more tunnel vision as to what I'm doing. My movements are more precise.

Speaker 6:          01:45:45       Yeah. There's so many Jujitsu players. I mean, I'm sure in all sports, the same thing in basketball, but you just bought huge too for sure. There's so many pop jujitsu players that are stoned out of their fucking minds when they roll, including the Diaz brothers. They admitted Bj Penn. There's no, and then when people come one guys and it goes, and then they say that it cuts down on your reaction time. That's impossible. If anything, if you're doing jujitsu and your reaction time is slowed down in any way, your jujitsu is going to suck. Totally. Just there's no way you can do anything that's going to slow your reaction time and be really good at it. It doesn't work that way. There's no way you can have slow reactions like when you know there's a reason why rappers always get high. When they wrap their flowing, they got a million words a minute coming out of their mouth. There can't be any slow reaction time. Yeah. A, it's a myth.

Speaker 1:          01:46:37       There's no slowing. It doesn't slow anything down. It's a not at all the mikes on different levels. people are complaining to on different levels. I turned yours up. I took yours down when you were doing the job ads because it was okay. Yeah, dude, it doesn't slow you down at all. People that say it does or silly, it's, it's, uh, if, if anything it just puts you in a different state of mind. It puts you in a very creative state of mind. If, if it wasn't for pot, I would say 80 percent of my material would be different. I think 80 percent of the things that I write, I write while I'm high and that's being very conservative because it could easily, could be 90 percent, can be 90 percent of all the things that I write, I write under the influence of marijuana and I think if it wasn't for the marijuana, I think the material would be different.

Speaker 1:          01:47:23       It's much like that fucking cat parasite changes the way people behave. Marijuana changes the way you behave, but it changes it in a good way sometimes. Sometimes. There's been many times where I've been stone where I look back at shit I have thought or done while I was stoned. I'm like, what the fuck was I thinking? Like what? All the time. Usually when it comes to like making videos or just anything, it doesn't give you great ideas. It just gives you more of the energy to do the ideas, more ideas that you would already come up with, but you're getting them all at once and everything is. Everything is supercharged and it's really fast. It doesn't. That makes dumb people smart. It depends on a bunch of things. Depends on first of all how high you get because if you get too high and you can get too high where everything spirals in front of you and it becomes like.

Speaker 1:          01:48:05       IT's like you have millions of dollars flying around you but you're in the middle of a tornado and you can't grab any of it. You know, and sometimes you get to that super paranoid super high state and like that's not manageable and you have to wait until you come down from that super high to a more manageable place. Then you can become creatIve. Then you sit down and write and you can keep a thought going and you, you say that like maybe sometimes pots made you make shitty decisions, but that's just making you take chances when you're sober, you know, and you go back and you look at it, you know, maybe you're just not seeing it in the way that you were seeing it then and there wasn't complete, you know, do, you didn't fight a complete division. But look at how much cool shit that you have created from pot pot has been responsible for a lot of your really good editing too, don't you think?

Speaker 1:          01:48:51       Yeah, definitely. But I mean, I'm just saying, I'm just saying it's not 100 percent, like nothing's 100 percent, but you gotta remember you want it, you want to keep track of all that dumb ideas you come up with not stoned and then compare. Right. That's also what's your state of mind too? It's like, how are you coming to the creative table? Are you coming to the table tired? Are you coming to the table in a good mood? You know, I could have some personal issues going on, I could have some things that are bothering me or some, some unfinished business that I need to get taken care of before my mind can be a piece and then you get high and then you don't have a good reaction, but you could be in the best state and when I'm in the best state, when I'm feeling the best that I'm the most loose and my mind feels free and I'm happy and I'm positive and then I get high.

Speaker 1:          01:49:33       Then she Just feels like it all just tunes in. then I feel like I'm wide open to the point where there's nothing that's bothering me, nothing that's, that's tightening me up. So I'm wide open and loose and then the weed hits and it's just like, it just washes you in this crazy energy. It just hits you with this blast of light perception in this new way of seeing things that, you know, it sometimes can fuck you up. But I think when even when it fucks you up, like there's lessons in that shit. There's lessons in why it fucked you up. There's lessons in where your head was at when you weren't in the right place. You know, it's just, it needs to be fucking. Someone needs to teach us how to do it. That's what it is. It's a very complicated thing using any entheogens, losing marijuana, using mushrooms.

Speaker 1:          01:50:15       There should be people that are professionals that can talk people through the use of these things. Like how you were talking last week about the shermans and fuck yeah man, we need that. We need that. If we had that with, I hope that's something that comes out of this whole marijuana legalization thing. I hope you know, marijuana therapy therapy for people that, you know, look, people need gambling therapy. You don't, I don't, you know, we can gamble and quit and so big deal, but some people get knocked up on gambling. They had fucked up and they can't stop gambling and I think there needs to be a therapy for weed people too. For some people that Just get fucked up on weed and it's really just therapy they need, you know, most of these addictions, addiction to masturbation, addiction. These are all psychological addictions are not physical addictions, but they're still there, so they're going to have to have that. They're gonna have to have therapy for people to get fucked up on. We'd, you know, if we want to keep it healthy society during the transition, but it's no different than therapy for guys that cheat on their wives for therapy, for, for masturbation or therapy for anything. It's like you just got an error, right

Speaker 4:          01:51:16       guys? I got take off. We've been on Two hours, right? It's 5:00 on the button for two hours. It's perfect. Holy shit. That was quick, man. That's the way to do it, son. Awesome. Austin. We had some great interesting discussions. Yeah. You know, a good time for anybody who, uh, is interested in following brian's shit. More brian stuff. Go to red band.com for eddie bravo. Go to a 10th planet. J. J.com. What does that, bruh was pointing to the bottom jump on the nibiru forum. The forum on my site is pretty key. Very Just like you're talking about it. Oh, oh no, no, no. I'm just saying go to a. His website's on there, so it's just pointing to the name eddie bravo. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know what the fuck you're done. Um, yeah. You were, I thought you were finding something and then you're dividing rod.

Speaker 4:          01:52:07       Anyway. The um, uh, the 10th planet jiu jitsu website is 10th planet. J. J.com. Yes. and if they want to like, ask questions and show you got a forum, what's the forum? it's called call it the nea bureau forum. The template. The but new newbie. Oh, by the way, 10th planet jujitsu. Even the name 10th planet. Jujitsu is all from the zechariah stories. Yeah, that's funny thing about 10th planet jiu jitsu was I decided to, uh, when I first decided to open the school, I needed a name for the school. I needed a name for the style and I wanted something. I definitely wanted something in the, in a style I want it. I was thinking nibiru

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       to did. I was actually thinking that it's like nibiru jujitsu. Will people get that something I knock you jujitsu or something. Joe goes, right. We were en route. We're entering your security gate. You said why not just 10th planet jiu jitsu stupid. No, no, no. Something like rocky sitch. And you thought about a 10th planet jujitsu, huh? Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah, that's it right there. Fuck me bro. Jujitsu. That sounds good.

Speaker 1:          01:53:14       You know, um, we're, we're good friends and so I don't necessarily talk about you too much just because you know, I kind of take it for granted because we're good friends, but I've done the forward to two of your books and we've been friends for 10 years now. Like strong. And the weirdest thing about this whole a jujitsu thing is watching it blossom out of just hanging out when you were a purple belt and just talking about different techniques to now this nobody fucking thing where you've got affiliates all over the world and other countries and shit and you're traveling all over the world doing seminars and teaching people this shit. All the while it's this weird combination of like stoner sensibility and openminded creative jujitsu and you know, even the fucking name is hilarious. 10th planet jujitsu. There's something. I mean, this is like some crazy alien, you know, hybrid system, you know, the, the whole, the whole thing is in the world of martial arts is a very unexpected to have someone who's got this sort of silly, like goofy outlook on so many different things and, and, and has got a sense of humor about so many different things and smokes weed and it was always playing pranks on people like prank people all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:54:31       Well, people don't know where's the best place to see some of those because some of them are fuckIng hilarious. He's got jujitsu students who pretend that they're angry brazilians who come to fight eddie and they come to challenge them like they're karate masters or you know, they're different. Different

Speaker 2:          01:54:45       thanks. Sometimes he's not a burden. That was never a brazilian. It was always just the expert. Now he's adding a brazilian accent. Okay, now he is, but at times he's just a random karate guy. Orange. He's been like days of our lives, very talented, hilarious actor slash comedian. He was tech tech on days of our lives years ago and he's so fun. He Trains with us at 10:30

Speaker 1:          01:55:08       planet and they set it up all the time where he comes in and whenever there's a new person there, they did it with alan belcher. They did it with the tim lee did it with a bunch of different people. Whenever someone's there that doesn't know that

Speaker 2:          01:55:18       bag, we got tom lawler with it. Good. We got tom lawler hook, hook, line, and sinker. How about when you get seasick? People's cecil piece of people's freak the fuck out. now they get to the point where they do. It's so ridiculous where eddie chokes these guys out and pretends to kill them, and then a students dragged the guy off into the garage, into the backyard, to a total douche bag. Premises premises were signed. Comes in. We give each other a wink. He starts doing karate kata on the disrupting the class and the crazy thing is I'll get the camera. Men usually they'll be pumped to. I want to. Denny percopo is my one of my black belts. I went up to him a few years ago and when, when he walked in, he never saw the response sketches before, so I went up to denim denny, you got your camera on you, and he goes, yeah, yeah, what's up bro?

Speaker 2:          01:56:00       I go, get it out. Keep the kicker on this guy might have to fuck this dude up. He's like, okay, okay. Okay. Video taping. And I tried to sell it like we get into like an argument or a discussion for a couple minutes so you know, we don't want to get too crazy. We slowly dragged people into it. We start arguing and then we just start fighting and then I get crazy. I tried to kill them. I'm a total douche bag. I actually tried to kill the twitches and shakes and shaded kicks his legs and then people drag them off into the back. we just did it at the ufc expo in front of a lot of people. Got it on. We got tom lawler and vinnie my. That is fucking hilarious. What's so hilarious about it is it's completely unexpected. How many people would think that a jujitsu master would also be doing pranks like on a regular basis?

Speaker 2:          01:56:48       Most of those pranks or on my dvd, mastering the rubber guard, a bunch of them. And the original one, the original bag that I got on video is in 2010 years ago as quad tooth when I, when I, uh, put some black makeup on and another time I was a black guy, I was scaring my friends. That's my mastering the rubber guard dvd. that was the original one. That was before punk. And that's, I've alWays had that in me for some reason. You have a very strange sense of humor. It's like my default setting is constantly saying like inappropriate things and the wrong things and I don't know what it is. You have been like that since I met you and that's why I tried to talk to you to do stand up. And he did it for nine times. Yeah. Damn. Standup is way harder than jujitsu.

Speaker 2:          01:57:29       That's for damn sure not to spend a lot of time perfecting. Stand up. You can't just go up there and tell jokes. Jujitsu wasn't in the beginning. It's no different. I think it's just like anything else to get great at anything just requires time and effort and thought and concentration and evolving. That's all it is. And comedy, you know, you got to bomb. You started off terrible. If you saw me when I first started off, if I had some video, I got some somewhere, some vhs tape of me on stage, like, like the 10th time I was ever on stage or something like that. Dude, I was fucking terrible. you know, one's good in the beginning. It's like everything else. I mean, you got good at jujitsu. You aren't good at jujitsu when you first started and thinking about you now, you know, that's a, I think about, you know, since when I tried stand up for the first time, I had never.

Speaker 2:          01:58:11       It was before I had a school. We were hanging out at the comedy store every week and I'm seeing all these guys go up and bomb and I thought, you know, I could do this shit. And um, you know, I went up and I realized that if I put a lot of time into it, I might be able to be okay, but I had to, I was spreading myself too thin. I had to really think about what I was at, what was I going to be a comedian, a jujitsu flair and end of musician. I had to figure it out. So I just decided to not pursue common anymore and just focus on jujitsu and focus on my music. And who knows, maybe one from, from

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       teaching the last seven years I think I've gotten a lot more comfortable speaking in front of people when before I was teaching, that was the hardest part of comedy is getting up and talking to a crowd that's stopping you crack jokes when you were on stage at the viper room. Yeah. BuT you know what, when people are aren't paying for laughs, it's easier to make them run pan to it. It seems like it's a little different finding. So it's easy. I could well coming from someone who's done it. and this is why I told you in the beginning that you could do it. It's just a matter of effort and concentration. You have a comedian sense of my sense of humor. Now days with youtube, eddie could make a video that's probably a million times funnier than him having to go on stage for three years just to get a joke out, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:59:27       Right. But it won't be standup comedy, you know, the differences, you know, standup comedy, you can actually have a bunch of people come to see you in a place. You can make a living off it. Yeah. But he can make a living off of these videos if you wanted to do the same shit. You know what I mean? Like today, how do you make a living off youtube? really weird. Are you making a living off youtube videos? I could if I wanted to. Probably. Really? How much do you make off to people make off youtube videos. There's people have whole careers based on youtube videos. Look at taylor. Look how much. Okay, but how much money can you make off of youtube video you're saying from advertising? Are you saying from people coming to see you and I'm saying now I'm saying back in the day used to be you had to get on stage to not become a standup comic and really work to get like 30 people in a room where nowadays you can take these same bits and jokes, make it into a youtube video, get a billion people and if you keep on doing that then you could have a whole career based off either advertising or you could have like a show on crackle.

Speaker 5:          02:00:18       I mean there's a lot of websites like crackle that have sitcoms are tv shows, web based series that are all based off people that did it and I understand what You're saying. however, what you're saying diminishes the idea of the artist standup comedy and that's why it's silly. I'm telling him thAt he could be an artist, a standup comedian. He can go places and perform and do stand up comedy. What you're saying is he can instead do videos. I think a lot. I think a lot of standup people that want to be standup comics are now changing how they're getting their audience. You know, I Think I definitely think can be people want to be. Comedians were getting a lot of audience. I mean that bob burnham kid, he, he got a huge following from his youtube videos and you could definitely get people attracted to stuff that you put online and they want to come see you live.

Speaker 5:          02:01:00       But what I was saying to eddie was that he could be an artist, so stand up comedian as an artist. He could do it. He has a sense of you're welcome. He has that sense of humor. He's got that way of looking at things. He's always looking at the most ridiculous side of things when whenever there's a subject that comes up with the news, he's always looking at the most ridiculous aspect of it. LIke automatically. And that's, that's a comedian sensibility things that funny guy looking for an audience. So yeah, he is. But that's what I'm saying. like stamp comics seems kind of diluted nowadays because I think if you're a funny guy looking for an audience back in the day stamp comedies that like one of the only few options you could do because you couldn't get tv show. So now these people are like, hey, I'm a funny guy. I want an audience. You know? I think a lot

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       of these, I think stamp comedies probably getting more and more diluted as more time goes on. What don't you thInk? No, I disagree because I think the art of standup comedy, to me as a patron, as a person who goes to see it, is still the most fun thing to see. I went to see a louis c k the other day with ari. I fucking loved it. I had a great time. I sat in the audience or the day when aziz ansari was working out of shit for the mtv music awards. I was on that show, don't you? And I enjoyed it. I, I still enjoy the art of standup comedy in a, in a crowd with a bunch of people there. It's funnier, you know, it's like the, the comedy club atmosphere. I like. I like sitting in the crowd. I like drinking. I like how everybody's laughing together.

Speaker 1:          02:02:18       I think that art form to me is insanely satisfying. Way more satisfying than watching a video clip on youtube. I haven't used the same thing. I mean you said that there's a little. There's barely any real stamp comics nowadays, but have. There used to be a bunch of real standup comics and nowadays there's. That number seems to be a lot smaller. Well, it's just because there's less places to work. In boston where I used to be mad, there was so many different comedy clubs in boston, so many open mic nights that there was a real community developed around it, but then as the economy tightened up and as you know, a lot of these comics that were in that area moved out and the guys that had been there for a long time really didn't write any new material. Does the scene died out? But if there was more comedy clubs and it was a thriving community, they'd be more comedians.

Speaker 1:          02:03:01       The real Problem is they don't have enough places to perform. There's not enough open mic nights and you know, comedy comes and goes, man, there's, there's waves. But I think right now is a very good way for like established guys. Like if you look at all the guys that are around like louis c, k, and a chappelle, chris rock, dave attell, nick depaulo, jim norton a patent oswald, of course, he's one of my personal favorites. And you see all these different guys that are out right now. If you're a fan bill burr, of course, if you're a fan of standup comedy, there's so much good comedy going on, right? francisco, francisco, I think this is one of the best times ever for standup comedy. I think what's happened with the youtube and the internet and my space on the ship is that people have had a chance to extend their careers and, and, and make their careers like penetrate further in than they would have ordinarily.

Speaker 1:          02:03:54       Not having any television shows, not having any movie credits. You know, now people are gettIng big audiences just from stand up comedy just from using the, uh, the youtube clips. Why wouldn't you think that most standup comics are in it just to become actors? No, dude, no. Really. There's nothing more fun than real standup comedy. I guarantee you jim norton is not in. It's just become an actor, a guarantee you louis ck is not in it just to become an actor. They're really good guys or not. There's so much fun in doing standup, but that's just like a couple people compared to the thousands and thousands of people that are in it for standup comedy to become what we're talking about the best guys, but we're talking about. I just think that a lot of people look at the idea of doing standup comedy as a lot of pressure and that because of that pressure, they looked to get off that pressure and that a television show is like a relief.

Speaker 1:          02:04:43       Like, oh, I'm free of the pressure now. If the show bombs, it's not me. That bombs is to show if the bad writing was there when I got there. There's nothing I can do about it. If I do a movie and the movie doesn't do well, but the next month he does fine, then I'm okay and so it becomes less responsibility on their back and a little bit easier and they look at it as a steady income as opposed to like something stand up comedy. It's like, you know, no one's really going to be sure that people are gonna. Come see you next week. You know, you could only assume that you're going to continue to have an audience and you have to continue to produce and continue to do a, you know, new sets on television, new comedy, central specials. Continue to write new material after that gets released so that people could come see you a year later and they know you got all new shit. So there's a lot of pressure and a lot of people don't like that. Maybe one day we'll do a, we'll do a b. Brian will get up and we'll battle onstage.

Speaker 5:          02:05:34       Battle battle battle. Yeah. Why can't you just go up? How about this? How about we do a 10th planet show and a jovial host. Guys will go up. Fair battle. No, we don't have to. No, no, no. What I'm saying is do it

Speaker 1:          02:05:50       planet. Show joe. He goes up and host brings aria. Brings one of you guys up for, you know, five or 10 minutes. Whatever you're comfortable with. Brings. uh, the other guy up. And then, uh, and then I'll go up. We'll do it. I'll do a show. I could do five minutes. Yeah, I think you're both could do five minutes. Brian fucking killed it in, in atlanta when he hadn't done comedy in years and he got talked to the june it during the nighttime show filled with ufc fans. All fucking hammered on a friday night. Sold out. You were killed. Not only did he do good, he went into the abyss and pulled himself out of the flames. He did good in the beginning and then he did a couple of jokes in a row that tanked. And you were starting to fucking freak out and he kept it together.

Speaker 5:          02:06:33       Yeah. But you know, I started doing it a lot and I did a whole bunch and I started doing it almost every week, a few times a week, but I got to a point where I'm just, I just didn't have it in me. You really have to give up your life to be a standup. Well, you know what,

Speaker 1:          02:06:47       man, you don't have to have it in you, but just because you don't have it in you, it doesn't mean that the art form is something that people should pursue if they want to be a comedian. What you're saying though is that, I mean as a comedian, I mean I know you're not trying to offend me, but as a comedian it's kind of offensive because you're saying that like somehow or another that someone if they wanted to, should just go and do youtube clips now and not become a standup comedian because it's too difficult.

Speaker 5:          02:07:09       No, I'm saying that if you are a uP comic nowadays that it seems like youtube would make a lot more sense. This boolean howard's target. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? To be an artist as a standup comedian, to be a real comic, you have to do it in front of an audience. It's the only art form where you must have an audience to practice. If you do not have it all, what's the difference between not going to be good? Because you don't have immediate response of people laughing at you. Whether you know whether or not. It's funny. Why don't we ever made ever. Now you

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       don't though. You're not hearing these people laugh. I don't hear shit. you just have people staring at you in texting things, right? You know you don't get the same kind of direct, immediate, tangible response that you get when you're going on stage. Well, you know what? Very asked various aspects of a joke or funny how the transitions work. You hear yourself and the recordings you need to know this part sounded falls or this part. How too many words and it's an art form. Just piecing it all together and performing it in front of a live crowd, but when you nail it, dude, when you're on stage and you fucking nail a joke where the audience is dying and you're like, they're dying now, and I got like five more levels to this joke, this joke, like I'm hitting them now and I'm like, I got some shit coming up to that, to this.

Speaker 1:          02:08:14       I can't wait to get to because I know if you think this is funny, this next part is my favorite part, and then boom, boom, boom, and it piles on. There's nothing like that that you're ever going to get off youtube. There's this. You're not going to get that feeling. You're not going to get that sort of a response from the people and as an audience member you're not going to get something that's that much fun. There's nothing to me, more fun still after doing comedy for 20 years, there's nothing more fun than watching comedy. It's the best man. It's so much fucking fun. It's the, to me, the most fun art form and that's why I'm a comedian. What I was trying to say is that eddie could have done that too. The only difference between me and him is that he had other things to do is focusing on and he he went and pursued those, but if he didn't, if he wasn't thinking about pursuing a career in jujitsu and wasn't thinking about pursuing a career in music and have the kind of time that I had when I started out doing comedy, for sure, you would be just as successful as me for sure.

Speaker 1:          02:09:04       You'd be able to do everything that I'm doing come true come true. You'd be able to do everything that I did. Everything. It's not hard. It's just a matter of focus and if you're an honest person and you evolve and you you your objective and you look at your shit and you keep working at it, that's all it is. Maybe one day I'll call you have the sense if you don't have the sense of humor, okay. if you don't have the mind for comedy, that type of person who looks at things goes, everybody else is agreeing, and you go, wait a minute, what the fuck is that like? That's how I was my whole life and that's how you are, and brian, you are to a certain extent too. I mean you have a different sense of humor than I do and brian and eddie has a different sense of humor that you and we're all different, but we all have the same thing where brian like you, your sense when it comes to technology, you're always doing this.

Speaker 1:          02:09:44       Someone to bring up a point and you'll. You'll always be like, no, everybody just thinks that because this bubba, bubba, bubba, you'll go against the grain right away and pick out the flaws. That's the idea. That's the mind of a standup comic. The person who stands up as the person who's functioning societies to stand up and look at things besides being funny. Stand up and look at things and goes, what the fuck is this? That's what the comic does. The comic looks at something. He goes, what the fuck is this? When everybody else just takes it for granted, there's a lot of comics out there. They just never become comics. That's what I'm trying to say. There's guys that work in gas stations that could be one of the funniest guys that have ever walked the face of the earth. Just no one ever talked them into getting onstage.

Speaker 1:          02:10:20       They never directed their life in that order. They never had the discipline to follow through. You know, there's so many people like that that I met out there. My friend johnny b, my friend who was a pool player that died. That guy could have been one of the funnIest fucking comedians that ever lived. That dude could read. Human nature knew when people were full of shit, knew, knew what people's insecurities and weaknesses were, and always knew the funniest shit to say at any given moment. There's a lot of people like that out there and that's what a stand up comic as you both are. You both could do it. Thank you very much. Thank you. This fucking shows over bitches. It's five. Oh yes. thank you for sponsoring us. Fleshlight. Please don't. Don't be a pussy if you are a pussy and you know, and you want to lIve your life, just pretending you don't masturbate or pretending that it's something shameful about getting pleasure on your deck, then don't order the fleshlight, but everybody else go order one of those things and fuck the shit out of it.
