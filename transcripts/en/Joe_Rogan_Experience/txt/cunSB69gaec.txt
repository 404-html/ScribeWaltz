Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       boom. We're alive. That's it. Just like that. So thank you for doing this. Welcome. What's going on? Total pleasure. Nothing. Happy to be in La are you? I am always New York's could right now though. Right? It's good. It's like June ish. It's like an addictive relationship, but most of us would rather be in California. New York is, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, um, you're a psychiatrist and um, I would think that there was ample work in New York, just the environment that New York provides people stacked on top of each other, like that beep, beep Hong Kong. Fuck you all that like, I would just assume all that stress leads to a lot of people with a, yeah, absolutely. It's like if you're a fisherman, you want to live near a river. Right? Right. And it's fetishized in New York too, to have a psychiatrist. It's sort of almost expected that you do.

Speaker 2:          00:00:56       So not only is there like ample supply and demand, but then it's, you know, it's a thing you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. What, what's that about? Can you explain that? I think it's like, you know, Woody Allen level, right? Like sort of embracing your shadow and then there's something refreshing about it because we don't pretend to be okay. I mean we're deeply not okay in New York. Chronically bullied someone. Okay. Like in general anywhere. Is there a spot like, oh yeah, Seattle, they've got it nailed. I mean there's this term actually in the medical literature, believe it or not, called Paleo deficit disorder and it just refers to like how far have you strayed from the path in your lifestyle? Like basic stuff, greenspace movement, you know, sleep. And I would imagine that if you have more of those components intact, you're probably a bit more okay than if you're living, you know, right.

Speaker 2:          00:01:46       In midtown Manhattan, like Seattle in the summer to me is a really good place because it's so green and it's so pretty. And the ocean's right there. So you're getting some good air and then you're getting sun cause it's the summer. So you don't have to seasonal depression thing that goes on. I mean I imagine they're doing better. They're doing it, they've been there. You never know. I've heard it's like crazy beautiful. Yeah, it's awesome. It's awesome. But those winners, they get to you after the 30th day around and you're like, come on, this is stupid. Like how much water do you need? I'm like a big, big winter complainer and I have been my whole life. So I complain 10 months of the year of what it's like to live in the northeast. But recently I've been playing around with the idea that there's actually something cool about like, you know, sort of cyclical living. It's almost just like if you embrace it, then there's something just like everything did and miserable for a period of time and then it blooms. You're getting to experience like this rebirth and then it, you know, flourishes and then it dies again. But there's another perspective on that actually being, I don't know, like if you work with it, it's sorta like a woman who's on birth control

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       has no idea that there's any point to, uh, you know, a cycle of energy over the course of the month range. She sort of thinks is that, that's annoying. But there's a way you can wrap your mind around it where you work. Okay. So like if you're on birth control, you have no menstrual cycle, right? So you're just like, you're like a man, you're like a flat line the whole month. But there's actually something really empowering if you understand how to work with your energy shifts because naturally like a woman's natural men, I know this is really what you want to be talking about, right? It's salient to me. So I do want to hear like I figured this out, I'm 39 I was on birth control for 12 years, so I never knew what it was, what it meant to have like a menstrual cycle until very recently.

Speaker 3:          00:03:44       Cause then I had two kids breastfeeding. So a couple of decades into my life, I'm just figuring this out. But you have like totally different kinds of energy over the course of the month and you have to know how to work with that. So there's a kind of energy that you want to go out and socialize or you want to stay in and work or you want to sleep more or less. And if you don't know how to ride that, then you could be sort of taken off guard by it. But if you know how to work with it, it's so much more powerful than just having this like artificial hijacking of your endocrine system.

Speaker 4:          00:04:14       That's interesting. So there's like some sort of analogy to be drawn between the cycles of nature and the cycles of your body month to month. Yeah. Huh. I would have never considered that. I never even thought about it, but I have thought about birth control before about how crazy it is that you give a woman a hormone that convinces her body that she's perpetually pregnant and that a giant percentage of women are on it for convenience or even from other medical issues like skin issues. Right,

Speaker 3:          00:04:40       exactly. Yeah. I mean when I, I've always been a feminist, right? So even when I was younger and very much asleep, I identified as a feminist and I was one of those people who thought that birth control was like a female entitlement. Like how dare you not make this free and widely available. But as I began to research more about it and more about how it's in many ways like the ultimate, you know, not to sound too inflammatory, but the ultimate tool for oppression of you know, the modern woman now I find it incredible that we, you know, there were still taking it because it seems like a good idea, right? Who wants to deal with your annoying menstrual cycle? Who wants to get pregnant, who wants to have endometriosis or polycystic ovary, you know, who wants to have acne or like hair growing in weird places. But it's the magic pill illusion. There's no free lunch, there's never going to be something that just fixes it for you and you just waltz off into the sunset. There's always a cost and the cost is so much more vast, like ranging from literally death all the way to just like subtle alterations in your personality. And like the fear Moans, you secrete, you know, and there there was just a million woman study, um, and Scandinavia that showed about the vast increase in antidepressant

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       prescribing for teenagers who are prescribed birth control. So it's the beginning of sort of, it's like a gateway drug sometimes for psych meds to her. I had a friend who, one of his good friends, his daughter died from some complications with taking birth control pills and smoking cigarettes. Yes, pulmonary embolism, probably smoking cigarettes. Apparently along with the birth control pills are extremely dangerous, but so many do it of course. And you don't even have to have that additional risk factor, you know, cause birth control, whether it's the pill or something called the Nuva ring by itself has that, you know, I'm contacted often by parents of girls who have died from pulmonary embolism who've now become like activists in this realm. It's because of birth control pills. Yeah, yeah. No, it's like a known mechanism and it's a known risk factor. Like I think that's not being suppressed or hidden.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       It's just that we're sort of in trained to dismiss the risks as we attached to the promise, so we sort of like collude and ignoring that potential. You know? That's so interesting because most people when they think about the birth control pill, they think about it as something that liberated women. Exactly. They can control whether or not they got pregnant and they were allowed for the first time to have careers and do whatever they wanted to because they didn't have to worry about being trapped. That's right. That's a story, but that's the biological free lunch thing, right? There's isn't there also a lot of issues. Chris Ryan was on here at Dr Chris Ryan, the author of sex at dawn. He was on here and he was talking about how women can look. If you smell the clothes of other men, you can literally tell the men that you are attracted to, you would be biologically compatible with those men and that when they did these same studies on women who are on the birth control pill, they couldn't smell the difference.

Speaker 2:          00:07:47       That's right. It's called the t shirt study. Yeah. How does that work? Could you explain that? Well, essentially the, the premise of pharmaceutical medicine is that you can just pull like one little thread of the spider web and leave the rest of it intact. Like everything else is going to be fine. We're only working on this one area. So with birth control for example, the idea is we're just, you know, taking over the management of your sex hormones, but the rest of your body is going to be totally unaffected. And of course as we learn more about how all of these systems are totally an inextricably interconnected, we have a better understanding of how, you know, when you interfere with sex hormones, you also potentially have other effects including, um, raising things called binding Globulin is including inflammatory response. You're depleting a number of nutrients and we're having, you know, it's possible that we, we haven't even begun to look through the keyhole of the effects on brain and you know, sort of neuropeptides and these arenas where we don't have any idea what pheromonal secretion is about. Like we just have to defer the probability

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       that our bodies are more complex than we've. Right and like began to understand. So your biology is meant to guide you. It's meant to empower you and it's meant to create a sense of vitality. If you can inhabit your body and be in a truce with it. That's part of the problem with the mindset of birth control is I'm just going to, you know, take this over. I'm going to some manage this. And so who knows? Maybe even it's a top down like mindset thing that begins to sort of divorce you from your sensibilities. We don't really know is the point that's going, that's going to be a common answer I think I have to give you is that we, we don't really know, but it, it does make sense that you're, you know, the subtle nature of your biology that involves, you know, sort of guiding your human interactions and particularly sex related interactions is going to be derailed.

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       I mean, low libido is one of, ironically the most common, um, disclosed side effects of birth control. So you're, you're taking it so that you can have unprotected sex. We don't feel like having sex ultimately anyways. So it's not even really that well thought out, I think by most of us. That's very bizarre. But what other alternatives are there? I mean if you're a woman and you want to have control of whether or not you get pregnant, there's not a whole lot of options other than weird ones like Iud, which seemed real weird. Yeah. I mean there is some of my patients use what's called a copper iud. You know, it's funny cause I had one put in and two and a half, it costs like $700 and two and a half weeks later I had it taken out because I just felt weird about having like a pharmaceutical metal and mind.

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       And my body was about like a tracking device. It felt like feel it and there are no, no, no, it's not really a thing. It's just like psychologically it felt weird. But um, I use something called a daisy, which is like this highly calibrated thermometer. I need track your, you know, cause you have six fertile days a month. This isn't, you know, like some major sacrifice you have to make in order to learn how your cycle works and then you get the benefits of being in your hormonal millia you know, like it's not, um, it's not that complicated, but there's a learning curve, you know, requires like learning how to be a woman and also sharing the onus because you know, with all of these side effects had been talking about, you know, there was like a male birth control study that was just terminated because of how many side effects like the men didn't want to deal with.

Speaker 3:          00:11:22       You know, so there's such this socio cultural double standard around this, but if we're talking about six days a month, like have we collaborate and try and figure something out, you know, that doesn't involve a risk of death. Perhaps this daisy thing just monitors or temperature and tells you exactly what's going on. Yeah. I mean it's a little more sophisticated than that. It actually has the efficacy like above 99% efficacy if you listen to it. That's part of the, you know, room for human error, but it basically just tells you like have sex now if you want to conceive or if you don't then don't. So it's a little like a light's green,

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       red or yellow. Well, how many women are on birth control? If you had to guess nationwide? You know, I would, that's a good question. I don't know the stat off hand. Upwards of like 10 million I would say. But that's a growing number of people taking some sort of substance that alters the, the very nature of who they are. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, my interest in it really came from looking at the psychiatric side effects because I'm very interested in medications that have potential, you know, gateway effects around psychiatric meds that we aren't informing women have before they start the prescription. So, you know, whether it's like acid blocking medications, you know, or antibiotics, um, you know, birth control of vaccines, these things have known a psycho biological effects. If you don't know that, then you'll never connect the dots. And then you end up in the polypharmacy realm where you're taking multiple meds without ever knowing where the dominoes like started to fall.

Speaker 2:          00:12:57       I remember there was a commercial they used to have, I don't know if they're still there, but it was for a psychiatric medication that you take who's an antidepressant when you are depressed from antidepressants. Do you know what I'm talking about? I think you've probably talking about abilify. It was actually the number one prescription in America recently. Terrifying. It's an anti psychotic, you read the side effects. It's like Whoa, slow down. Like what is this? Like psychotic thoughts and death and yeah, bleeding and right and if what you were taking that had similar side effects isn't working, then you can just layer this on. It's very common practice. It's very rare. I would say actually for people to be on just one psychiatric med. It's almost an industry standard to be taking upwards of, I would say, you know, two, three, sometimes even five. Many of the patients I work with come to me on a cocktail of like five medics.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       Jesus Christ. Yeah. Well, you're chasing something for like years, right? Because you're never really gonna feel yourself the way you want to. And that's what I've found is really what we want. You know, like we just want to feel comfortable in her own skin. We just want to feel ourselves like in fact, they don't want to, you know, be her or him or be rich are beautiful. We just want to feel cool being who we are. And you're never going to, I don't want to say never, but it's very unlikely you'd feel that way while on a medication that has consciousness altering effects and a slew of side effects. And so you're going to be chasing that with other, with the promise of other meds, you know, a stimulant because you're a paxil is making you tired and then you need a benzodiazepine because you can't sleep and you know, then you're sort of depressed again.

Speaker 2:          00:14:42       And so you have another antidepressant layered on. And then there's a fad, you know, sort of, you know, bipolar to medication that you could try out like lamictal or abilify. And so this is sort of the culturally sanctioned approach to mental health today. Yeah. So how does the doctor know? Like say if you think they put you on some zoloft or something like that, and I'm not to pick on Zoloft, but then they, they say, well, it's just not really totally doing it for Ya. Oh, we're thinking about stack and abilify in with the Zoloft and I think that just might be the ticket to your happiness. Right, right, right. Yeah. Well it's important to remember, right? Like particularly in psychiatry, there's no objective testing measure. You have a broken arm like, Hey, I see you have a broken arm. We're going to put your arm in a cast over the broken arm.

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       You can get an x ray. Right, right. Improve. They have a broken arm. Right. In psychiatry, there's no blood test. There's no eeg, there's no, you know, scan of any kind. It's a conversation. Sometimes as short as 10 minutes. If I came into your office and my office is a little different, but just say if you were a regular psychiatrist and I'm like, ah man, I dunno Kelly. I'm a fucking mess. I can't keep it together. What do I do? What do I take? Could you just start someone off on like a low dose of something and see if it helps and they come back and a couple of weeks like how does it work? It's like it, it's like an art form. I mean you have your personal favorite medications that you feel comfortable prescribing so you're more likely to prescribe them. But then also, and this is also, you know in the literature itself, if a patient comes in asking for a particular medication, then you 49% I think it was like of prescriptions that are written are written because of specific patient requests.

Speaker 2:          00:16:27       So like where are people getting exactly. They're getting these ideas from the fact that we are one of three countries in the world that allows for direct to consumer advertising. North Korea and Russia. No, it's surprising. It's surprising. Brazil and New Zealand. Oh Wow. That is surprising. It's weird, right? It confuses the hell out of me when I watch those commercials and those like beautiful piano music playing and there's cartoon flowers are smiling and everybody was brainwashed. What are they selling me? And they know it works. Ask Your doctor multibillionaires are put into those commercials. Yeah, for good reason. So there's no real like, there's not like a blood test or something they give you, they say, I think this is going to be the ticket for you. Nope. Yeah, no, it's very impressionistic. And that's sort of the issue. I mean, the diagnostic and statistical manual, the DSM is sort of the dictionary, so to speak, in psychiatry.

Speaker 2:          00:17:25       And like in the 50s, it was like 150 pages and now it's 886 pages and it's grown in volume largely because of the consensus decisions of a bunch of older white men sitting around a table. You say the bane, um, you know, almost all of them have industry ties. And this is out there. This isn't like a conspiracy theory on my mom was a nurse and she was always telling me that, um, they would, uh, get taken out on these really nice dinners by these pharmaceutical companies to take it to a real nice restaurant, buy steak and champagne potato and everybody could have a drink. And you know, they would be so willing to be like very complimentary of this medication. Why? I know a girl took this and it really helped her a lot. And you doctor Kinesin and I'm like, I was in that generation to where I got taken out to five star restaurants in Manhattan all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:18:24       It's by you stuff, it feels really good because you're making like 20 grand a year working your ass off. And so when someone takes you to a fancy restaurant with your friends, but you could convince yourself that it's not actually going to, you know, that you're an intellectual and you're gonna make your own decisions. But all of the data suggest otherwise that you are unduly influenced by that kind of courtship behavior. And it's, it's true. So we have this like, you know, sort of collusion on the part of the doctor and the patients to support industry interests over any, any sort of, I know, shred of a scientific or evidence based process for really diagnosing someone, especially when we're talking about something that is so subjective where it's not like a broken arm or a like a Joe, you've got a broken arm. Like I know what to do, we're going to set your arm in a cast.

Speaker 2:          00:19:13       It's like, so you're feeling down, hey man. Right. They even ask you like, does this, this does a normal cycle, like I guess like someone who's really good wood, but is your diet and your sleep patterns, is that a consideration before they prescribe medication medication? No. In fact, um, most sorta turncoat doctors like me will tell you that we have one hour of nutrition education in all of our medical school and residency training. One keeping you a turncoat or you like considered like a rat bad person in the industry. I'm not welcome in the highly calls anymore. Now I lost, saw my faculty positions and yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:19:59       Um, because I guess the kind of science that I bring to the table, which is not my own, I don't have any original ideas, but I, I am really good I think at curating information and collecting it and synthesizing it, presenting it, right. So what I have to shine a light on is very inconvenient, um, science for industry interest but also for conventional practice because, you know, I don't prescribe medication anymore under any circumstances ever. Um, but I do have an entire practice devoted to taking people off of medication. So I have sort of my thing, and it's a lot based on lifestyle changes you mentioned, right? If you don't have your methodology as an alternative to prescribing and you're going to what a

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       lot of the science says that condemns the pharmaceutical approach, what are you going to do instead? You just invested $200,000 of debt, blood, sweat, and tears, indentured servitude for like a decade of your training. You're just going to give that up, you know? So it's a lot to expect. The average psychiatrist who acknowledge, you know, anything beyond what's called like consensus medicine. It's called that because it doesn't even have a connection to the evidence. It's not evidence based. It's just they all agree on it and they're just going to keep doing it. You know?

Speaker 5:          00:21:19       So this consensus medicine, like in psychiatry, there's kind of like this understanding that you don't criticize the system that everybody's operating under. He just work within that system.

Speaker 3:          00:21:29       Yeah. Why would you bother? You know, cause just going to get you to be uncomfortable for you is going to get you in trouble and there's no incentive. You know? Like I read more science than probably all my conventional colleagues put together because I have a lot of incentive to do so because I'm practicing outside of the, you know, the gold standard so to speak. So when you're in the fold, why would you bother reading science? Who Cares? You just do what you are taught to do. Don't question it. You know? So it's, you know, the reason that lifestyle is not presented as a relevant factor in conventional medicine is because it flies in the face of the whole model, right? Like the model is still a gene based model. It's still are born with it. You know, it's like coddling the victim. There's nothing you can do about it.

Speaker 3:          00:22:19       So you know, you better just be a good boy and take your medication is the only thing you can do because diet doesn't matter, you know, whether you're, you know, huffing fumes through your window. It doesn't matter whether you're eating six cans of tuna day and mercury poisoning yourself, does it, none of that matters really. Maybe it's like of minor interest, but the real problem is your inborn genetic chemical imbalance, right? So if that is the premise, and it's not just in psychiatry, it's in all of medicine is gene based determinism, freeze Pharma to offer the only solution. And it actually validates people on some level as the victim, right? So like a lot of people want to feel weirdly, um, you know, like their own victimization. It feels comfortable.

Speaker 5:          00:23:07       And even though there's science that supports that having a healthy nutrient dense diet allows your body to produce the all the healthy hormones and chemicals and neurotransmitters and all of that. And then along with exercise, which also increases, it is having, there were studies also that show that exercise, regular aerobics exercise in particular, um, it does as much to treat depression as ssrs

Speaker 3:          00:23:33       more, more actually because the efficacy of most antidepressants is pretty embarrassing. Like, you know, to be frank because if you really dig into the literature, it's what you think it is. Um, in terms of really being a viable treatment option, so many of these natural alternatives like far out pace, I mean things even like herbs like Tumeric or acupuncture, Yoga, you know, exercise. And that's just a single intervention. So there's nothing miraculous about my approach. It's basically just putting all those things together at once for like a synergistic effect. So you can send your body and mind is like a signal of safety, right? And it works, right? So if you're just doing one of those things in isolation and even one of those things is more effective than you know, it's really, it really comes down to the mindset because if you wanted an a pill, it's going to be challenging for you to get results through effort or something behavioral. So the mindset piece has become a real focus for me as being maybe the most important determinant of what's going to be an effective intervention piece. Meaning meaning what you believe like about health and if you want to believe that you're broken and that you know, chemicals aren't necessary to manage your scary body.

Speaker 5:          00:24:55       I've changed a lot of smart people that believe that. I have a friend, she's a scientist, she's very smart, she's on antidepressants and if you talked to her, she will argue to the death and these are critical for her life and that she needs him. And she has some sort of a brain imbalance and it's no different than having you know, some other organ in your body. It doesn't function properly and you need medication for that. We've been told,

Speaker 3:          00:25:15       I was told that and I believe that for sure. You know, the analogy is often, well it's like insulin to a diabetic. It's the same thing. And the more you challenge that you're stigmatizing mental illness and how dare you, you know, I've been accused. Yeah, I've been accused of shaming women, which is of course the last, you know, all I care about is, is empowering women around their health. Literally I wake up every single day and devote my life to that purpose. Like the last thing I have any intention of doing is shaming anyone who's made this decision.

Speaker 5:          00:25:47       Well, it's just whenever something make someone uncomfortable with their choices, they immediately want to turn someone else into a, an aggressor or someone who is victimizing them. But this, uh, this woman that I'm friends with, it's unfortunate because I feel like, uh, if she exercised, at least she would know that she doesn't exercise. So if you don't exercise, do you don't really know if that would help. Right. You know, but I hate to be that guy because I already am, you know, like that proselytizing. You got to work out. God, that's fucking annoying. It's like the crossfit person or the proselytizing Vegan or whatever, a new cult member. You just want to talk forever about it. Still never going to convince someone why people to hate you. It's true. And it's like the, you know, you bring a horse to water thing, you know, you can't, can't make it happen of course. But there is more. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:26:37       Now, um, then I think ever before, like people are ready and once they have the information it's like, you know, usually like, and then they just transferred.

Speaker 4:          00:26:45       Well, these conversations are happening now more and more with people, um, where they're starting to look at like, what, what is it in my life that's causing me stress? What is it in my life that is a depleting my sleep patterns or my health? Have I ever gotten my blood test done and find out where my nutrient levels are? Yes. And you know, and everybody's nutrient needs are very different biologically. People like people are going to respond differently to drugs. People are gonna respond differently to food. It's just we, we come from different parts of the world and some people need different stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:27:19       And this is being called like an of one medicine and meaning like meaning the number of people in a study. So like the phrases and of one medicine, because we're beginning to understand exactly what you're saying, which is that it's you, this is your thing. This is your journey. This is very specific to you, right? So like, you know, your depression let's say, could be because you have a b, 12 deficiency. It could be because you have low thyroid function. It could be because you're taking birth control. It could be because you know your dog died. It could be because you have a shitty job that you hate. It could be because your marriage has to go. And it could be because you're ready for some psycho spiritual emergence, you know, and you are the only one who really knows and who really can figure it out. But we on the conventional side of things, seek to depersonalize it. So it's, it's not you, it has nothing to do with you. It's just a chemical process that's unfolding and you need this one size fits all intervention.

Speaker 4:          00:28:17       It's very disingenuous, but it's also a super common. Isn't that weird that that everyone, I mean there's the access to the data is there for everybody. It's there for psychiatrists as well. Like they would know the efficiency or the effectiveness rather of exercise. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:28:32       But that's what I'm saying. It's really coming down to like almost religious level belief systems. Like either you believe, right, which I used to ps. Either you believe that we're sort of machines, right? Like as Alan Watts would say, we're like flesh robots on a dead rock floating in the middle of nowhere. So everything is purposeless and random and it's just bad luck and bad genes. And you know, it's like the other shoe could fall at any moment and life is just the hustle and you're just trying to survive and you got to avail yourself of real medicine, which is pharmaceutical medicines. The only legit option and you just got to do it and you know what you want some credit for even having the courage to actually take the steps to take your meds. Right? So that's one mindset. And then the other, which is I believe growing, um, is that we have no idea what we're doing scientifically.

Speaker 3:          00:29:25       And we're just looking through the keyhole. And Science is a process. It's not like a destination where the science is settled. My favorite phrase, so you know, the body itself has this, you know, chiropractors call it vitalism like has this innate wisdom and it doesn't make mistakes. Like it doesn't mess up. Every single thing your body is doing is in wise response to a perceived, you know, stimulus, right? And Diseases of course, cancer, no, no. It would include without exception, without an, I could explain what I mean by that, but, but, right, so, so if I have an ache or a pain or I, my hair's falling out or I have a tumor growing out of the side of my body, my first response it's possible could be curiosity. Like it could be, what is this about, you know, where am I off? Right? Because in like indigenous cultures for example, illness is not like something that your body is doing.

Speaker 3:          00:30:28       It's the, you know, sort of manifestation of things out of balance with you and your soul, you know, with you and the relationships in your life with you and nature and maybe the collective itself. So it's this expression, it's this physical manifestation of something much deeper that has roots. And until you understand what those roots are for you, you won't resolve it. Right? Serious errors like birth defects and things along those lines. That's not like a wise response to anything, right? It's an error. It's a good question. You know, the, the sort of like congenital question, like if you're just like born without a leg, I mean you could take it to the extent where you say, okay, so what drove the birth defect? Whether it was some sort of, you know, okay, so let's back up a second because Epi genetics, right? Is the word de jure for beyond or above actually technically jeans, right?

Speaker 3:          00:31:22       So there's the genes are interesting, but perhaps as insignificant as like 1% of what makes us sick, right? Or well, we never studied what makes us well it's like a total black box. But epigenetics is like how does the environment impact our genes? Right? So you could argue that a lot of congenital, you know, sort of malformations and things like that because this was an area of study for me when I was prescribing to pregnant women, which believe it or not, was my specialty prescribing psychiatric meds to two pregnant women. Um, that it is a risk in response to that exposure. And it's the body's method of adapting to an exposure or is it just an error? Like if someone's born without a leg, what kind of adaptation is that? It seems like so just some sort of a genetic error. No, it depends how you want to look at it. I mean, to me there are no errors because the body is responding to a perceived stimulus. Now if you throw a lot of toxicity, you know, in the way of your body, there may be a limit to which a can or will accommodate. Right? Cause like something confusing for me was at one point I was reflecting on the fact that, you know, we've had all of these environmental exposures for like about a hundred hundred and 50 years. Like since the industrial revolution, right? So we like live totally different lives now is all

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       these toxic exposures that we sit all day and we don't sleep and we have Monsanto and all the rest pretty much for like the past 100 years or so. We can adapt like my body is adapting within the hours that were, you know, hanging out. So why would it not have adapted over the past 100 years? And like a Paleo argument is like we've evolves the same way for 95% of our evolution and in now we just haven't taken enough time to evolve to catch up with today's modern influences. Right. But I actually think we're not meant to accommodate this and we will self extinguish. Like if we don't course correct, which I have faith we will do, but we're not meant to adapt to this kind of lifestyle. Yeah, exactly. Chemicals, you know of people if we don't course correct, I think we will. And I think it's pretty much like, I think even though we could biologically adapt, I think we won't because there is like a cosmic intelligence that is holding us accountable to a certain level of respect for this human organism.

Speaker 2:          00:33:53       A certain level of respect for the privilege of being alive. You know? And the way we're living today, just like trashing ourselves and trashing this planet is in, is a violation. So I dunno, I just, it's like a subtle point, but I think the point is we're not going to adapt, so don't wait for it. You know, and we're just going to get sicker and sicker and sicker and die and, and perhaps that is the most intelligent response. Doom and gloom. No, I said it's going to get better. Remember the sacrifice for productivity, the daily sacrifice for productivity that comes at the expense of health and happiness is the norm. You know, that's what a lot of people deal with. They deal with having bills and like as you were pointing about, pointing out about exorbitant medical bills, right? I mean, so many people that are in the medical industry start their practice or start practicing being a doctor of professional doctor with a quarter million dollar debt.

Speaker 2:          00:34:49       Right? Which is crazy. It's so much money. It's so crazy. It's so what a terrible idea. Like what's almost mandatory for any civilization? Well, you need health care for sure. You need to be able to take care of people. I got an idea. Let's take those people that you need to make these critical decisions to save your life and let's fuck them over. Let's saddle those people up with crazy debt and leave them trapped in a world of stress. And I got an even better idea when they're going through the residency. Let's not let them sleep. Right? Right. Keeping caffeinated sugar and work and give them pills. Give them, giving them amphetamines. You know, give him adderall. You need a prescription, sally, are you tired Sally? I got a little pick me up. It's called adderall sweetie. It's not your fault. You've got Adhd, d s t u P

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       qrs. But that's how it's like a hazing. It's a hazing process, not unlike the military. Right. You know, so that you remain loyal. I mean, that's obviously one perspective on it, but this is what I'm saying, right? Like I was $200,000 in debt. It took a lot for me to just like jump ship and say, okay, whatever. I, you know, invested that and I'm just going to walk away from it. Most people, you know, are not in a position to do that. And perhaps that's part of the design. I Dunno. Well I don't, even if it's not designed, it's a very efficient, efficient survival mechanism for the industry. You know, it just seems like one of the worst ways for someone to start a career in taking care of people's, to be all fucked up themselves, but they need to be broken down in that way to stay in line.

Speaker 5:          00:36:20       And that's kind of, it's just basic, you know, sort of hierarchical systems work this way. There is no conspiracy or is it people just taking advantage of this need and being greedy and just charging exorbitant amounts of money and having the whole thing subsidized by the government. So that could be expensive. And then the whole thing is crazy. And also here's the big one that a lot of people, maybe if you're a kid, you're not aware of this, your student loans you til you're dead. You cannot get out of those fuckers. Like you can get out. You could, you could buy Ferrari, you could be stupid and buy a Ferrari and go God damn it, I can't afford this car. And you go bankrupt and they will allow you to go bankrupt. Right. That's that. That can happen. You can have a business, make terrible decisions, lose all your money would go bankrupt and literally be absolved of your debt except your student loans.

Speaker 5:          00:37:14       That shit is into your DNA. They keep you, you have to pay that. You have to, it's crazy. It's so nuts how much money it is when you find out what the student loan industry is in this country and how much money children go, oh, you're a fucking child when you're 18 years old, right? So you make some ridiculous decision to go to some school and you get some grant or you get some sort of scholarship and then the rest of it you're going to get loans or whatever the hell your situation is. And then you get out of four years and then you go and do your masters. You go and do some graduate work. Ah, you're funds, you're fucked, you're so broke. And then if you get out, what are the odds? You even get a job in your field. You know, you have to scramble to try to make some money and then you have this never ending pool of debt that you have to suck a little bit out of every month.

Speaker 5:          00:38:09       It's like living for the oasis on the horizon, but that's what we do in this country. You know? We just are constantly waiting for it to feel okay. Constantly waiting to until we get there. We're not getting there. I think that free education, if it would be possible, if it is possible to do it without ruining the educational system, if it's not already ruined, if it is possible to do that, it'd be like one of the best things we could ever do for young people. Just keep them from being saddled down with some bullshit that you have to keep with you for the rest of your life. Say you like are handicapped out the gate. Yeah, it's crazy and it also, it inhibits any risk taking it. You're going to have any chance like to jump ship and try something new. Like maybe you're doing something, but all the while you have this idea of God, I thank think this is really what I'm supposed to be doing.

Speaker 5:          00:38:57       I'm always thinking about it. I got to take a chance, but I have this fucking debt and the only way to really pay this debt off is if I enter into this same, that's it. Oh, that's a really important point because if you sort of look across dimensions culturally, they're all geared towards supporting a certain kind of mindset and mentality, which is productivity oriented, which is, you know, capitalism and consumer supportive. Um, in terms of that, you know, sort of financial apparatus. And so the things and elements, you know, like Graham Hancock has talked about this, you know, the elements that are convenient to that paradigm, including psychiatric meds and even alcohol on some level, like these more sort of suppressive consciousness, suppressive tools are sanctioned. Right. But the things that would encourage risk taking and courage, creative expression and courage, you know, sort of consciousness expansion are demonized her, you know, rendered illegal because they're inconvenient to the paradigm, I guess.

Speaker 5:          00:39:55       But honestly, I think it's a victim of circumstance more than anything. When I, I don't, I'm not necessarily, I believe that when the psychedelic act of 1970 was put into play, it was clearly put it into play because they were trying to arrest people that were in the civil rights movement and the antiwar movement. That's been proven. It's been proven that there was a collusion and that what they were trying to do was make it so that they could go after these people in the civil rights movement go after these people that were in the antiwar movement and they would catch them for drugs and arrest them and they would cripple these movements. And this is all like documented, real clear by the Nixon administration. The reason why they passed that sweeping psychedelics act of 1970 which covered a lot of stuff that's not even psychoactive.

Speaker 5:          00:40:38       They didn't even know what they're doing. And they miss some of the big ones. They missed like five methoxy DMT, which is more than most potent psychedelic drugs. Don't demand just a few years ago used to be able to buy that shit online from a chemical companies. They would give you like a jug of it. They could get a whole city high for a month and you could go buy it with a credit card. Not that I know of anybody who did it. And I certainly didn't. And I definitely still still don't have any of it. But if I did, it's not even illegal. That's what's crazy. It's like they made stuff that was like a normal part of human use for thousands and thousands of years that made it highly illegal. And they did it at a time when they were trying to break down these people that we're trying to change society.

Speaker 5:          00:41:21       Right? So that was 1970 but along the way, I think what's really happened is it became a matter of financial risk. Like marijuana is a big one, like financial risk of the pharmaceutical drug companies. If they found out that there's so many different things that marijuana get help, whether it is a people's appetite or certain arthritic conditions, or you can go down the list, uh, kids with epilepsy, it's a huge factor on children with autism, especially edible marijuana, all these different things, all these different things that it treats. If that was made legal and people started turning to that and exercise and it'll a holistic approach, it would cost the pharmaceutical companies literally billions of dollars a year. So I think that's the big conspiracy. I think it's a, it's not really a paradigm consciousness sort of a thing. As much as it's a financial thing. I don't think the people that don't totally related, but I don't think the people that are suppressing it or even aware of the effects.

Speaker 2:          00:42:23       I agree. No, I would just part of the master puppet string puller. It's, it's like this organism that's just moved only in one direction, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:42:33       Yes. Money toward, yeah. The same reason why also involved in trying to keep these drugs illegal. You have prison guard unions because they want to keep their money coming in. Do you have police unions? I mean there's a lot of that where you find lobbying by these unlikely groups and you're like, I don't understand why, and then you go, oh, they just want to make more money. Right? Like they're more than willing to lock people up. They're more than willing to demonize helpful things that grow naturally and have virtually no negative effects in terms of like your health, things like marijuana.

Speaker 2:          00:43:04       Totally. I mean that's, that's why I, you know, when I speak about this, because I used to be really in like warrior mode on this, um, topic. Huh? How so? Like, what do you mean by warrior? I just thought, okay. Like I've, you know, once I woke up, whatever it was almost 10 years ago.

Speaker 5:          00:43:19       Do you ever use Hashtag woke, do you have a right to and no. No. Okay. Should I know it's a joke with the kids today. Hashtag woke or Hashtag woke AAF. I'm old. I'm old too. Okay. Half that's good. Woke as fuck. Yeah. Thanks. I got that. I'm a quick study. So when you, when you became aware of what I became aware, I was pissed. What was, was it a gradual process? No,

Speaker 2:          00:43:45       no. I um, I would, I got like sick, I guess. Uh, wasn't very dramatic. But my big sob story is that I was diagnosed with my, my first health condition, which is an autoimmune disorder after my first pregnancy. Hashimoto's. Oh, I have the, Oh, really? Yes. Oh, that's interesting. My Dad and my brother do. My mom has it also, I would just like not as common in men, but probably because nobody's looking for it. Um, yeah. So I was diagnosed with that and I just had this intuitive sense that I wasn't going to go to a conventional doctor even though I had never ever, you know, done anything but dismiss alternative medicine. Like I was hard core into the pharmaceutical model, very into science it from that perspective. Right. And so I, um, but I knew that all they had to offer was, and I, I

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       had enough patients that never felt well on it. And so it's weird stuff. Yeah. Stuff for a while. And then I switched to armour thyroid and a, that's one reason why I got pissed at doctor drew when doctor drew was giving that, um, that, uh, when he was talking about Hillary Clinton and all of her health issues and he was going over her prescription, he was mocking the fact that she was on armour thyroid and he was saying that that's old. That's an old way of treating him. Like he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. He's absolutely wrong because I went through a bunch of different stuff and then when I took armor, thyroid, all of the symptoms went away. Gone. And that's what the data shows that people feel subjectively better on t three containing. Yeah. We'll explain what that is. It comes from pig thyroid.

Speaker 5:          00:45:11       Yeah. It's a glandular and he's not wrong because it is an old fashioned medicine wrong there. It's ineffective though. He was talking about how outdated it is and that subject at all. People feel better on it. Yeah. So I took that for something similar, um, called nature throid for a while. But I went to a naturopath because, which is so funny that I did that, you know, at that time it sounds like a hippie. Did you go to a place with like macrame and stuff? Now? It's really good friends. Do you have any friends? Very friendly. Oh, she's friendly. Yeah. Did she smell like, but truly or incense? Yes. Oh, she did. Absolutely. That was good. That's, that's it felt right. Even that really struggling wrong at the moment.

Speaker 3:          00:45:52       No I did. And um, she, I put it into remission in the space of like a year in my antibodies were like in the high two thousands, my Tsh was like 20 and I had to do to put it in remission. So the same things I do with my patients. So I initially just changed my diet. So initially I just very simply at her recommendation and I'm Italian. I grew up Italian, my mom's from Italy and I ate cheese and bread of some variety, like five times a day, literally for my whole life. Right. So the two things, of course she asked me to take out where gluten and dairy, dammit. So has it been, it was a very amazing transition, but I, my early, when was that? I started like pooping every day and hadn't ever done that in my whole life. Thank you. Thank you. These things that matter. And so I was like, wow, she must be on to something. And then later I layered in other

Speaker 5:          00:46:47       stuff. Yeah. Well you eating a lot of vegetables at the time.

Speaker 3:          00:46:51       No, I think it was more about what I took out then at that point then like what I put in. But when I saw the change on paper, I was like, this is not even supposed to be possible. This is literally not even, we're not even taught that this is possible, let alone that it has anything. You know, they're putting autoimmune conditions into remission, has anything to do with diet. Right. And so I was really indignant and I've always been a science nut. I've always spent Saturday, you know, like a good four hours every Saturday on pub med. Of course I'm looking at different stuff over time, but I went to pub med and I was like, what else did I learn? And I was like on an obsessive rampage for like a good couple of years and that's when I just turned over every stone. Like everything, every sacred cow, whether all these meds we were talking about like you know, statens or acid blockers are antibiotics.

Speaker 3:          00:47:42       I then I got onto psych meds and then I started to look at the science supporting a very different kind of perspective on, you know, this interconnected model and the gut microbiome and you know, sort of the impact of belief on our biology that we can sort of like reprogram our hardware with our software, which is like we're the only species that can really do that. Um, that we can literally change. Yeah, exactly. And, but also interacts with your body and then you change your body. You literally change your body. So what did you do to do that? Like what methods? So I was very reluctant to meditate. I was an atheist, my whole like a belligerent, you know, sort of like Dawkins level, atheist, um, my whole life because I was a science worshiper and I was like, well, you know, spirituality and religion is for weak people who like need to believe in some fairytale to make them feel better about

Speaker 5:          00:48:41       typical New Yorker, New York liberal coming at Ya, New York liberals. Scientists.

Speaker 3:          00:48:47       Exactly. Well, it's scientism, right? It literally is the Church of, of science. And so, you know, when I had this crisis of faith, so to speak, like I was lost for a long time because science had sort of, you know, or what I believed has sort of failed me in some ways and then I didn't have, I don't know what the readiness to start meditating or find out what you know people were talking about when it comes to spirituality. Although I followed the literature, so like I read the literature on meditation and epigenetic expression for years and years and years and I used to tell my patients to do it, but I didn't do it and hold you back because I liked feeling stressed out. Yeah. When you don't do something, you're not doing it because you like actually being sick. You like how you're feeling, you're invested in it.

Speaker 5:          00:49:37       Is it that you like or that your addictive familiar in that? Yeah, it's comfortable

Speaker 3:          00:49:41       and the unknown for some of my patients, the meditation piece is the last part because they know it's going to be the game changer and they're not ready for everything to just be totally reconfigured. They're not ready for that level of transformation.

Speaker 5:          00:49:53       What they say too about sometimes people that are addicted to cigarettes that you're almost addicted to the idea that you're doing something bad or yourself. You're addicted to that rush of being naughty. Yeah. Oh, so good. Oh, so good. It confirms, yeah, some like self loathing hook too because you're like, fuck it. I'm alive. Who gives a shit? This is all bullshit. I'm not the future. Fuck the future. Trialists settle now. Right? Like so many fucking smart people smoke cigarettes and it's so confusing. It's like you're making a deal to slowly pay to poison.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       You'll like throwing a little bit of money in the pot every month. Guarantee you guaranteeing that 20 years down a line, 30 years down the line, however long it takes, you're going to have some, some bolt is going to come off the machinery and the, Hey Mike, you got a tumor in your lungs. It's not good. We're going to have to cut one of these things out of your chest. You can get by on one lung buddy. This is what we got to do though. We got to, you got to start eating papayas. Like what sort of thing, why am I even alive? You know, we all do stuff like that. I mean it's not always trained, but we recognize, right? Yeah, we do because we, you know, we're invested in reflecting a felt wrongness, you know, I would call it felt wrong. Like we feel deep inside something is wrong, wrong with us, wrong with society, right.

Speaker 2:          00:51:13       Something's missing and then we don't want to pretend that everything is okay. So we self medicate, you know, right there with you know, drugs or cigarettes or you know, workaholism or you know, sex addiction or we're all sort of in this place not wanting to acknowledge that there's a reason, you know, like one of my favorite quotes is this, like Christian Murti quote, that it's no measure of health to be well adapted to a profoundly sick society. Right. So, right. We really low. I love New York. It's the best. I love the traffic. I like. You're like, oh, you're a sick person, man. Nigga is wrong with you. Totally love it. Hong Kong some home.

Speaker 4:          00:51:53       Yeah. That's a weird, one of my very, very best friends is just addicted to York. Yeah. And it's like loves it. He's been there forever. He's like an abusive relationship. Loves the city. Totally. But he loves the energy. He likes to all the cars and traffic. I don't, you know, I don't know what it is, but he's healthy like fairly like physically he's got a few issues but like mentally

Speaker 2:          00:52:15       very healthy. That's unusual. Look like just one thing sorted out. He's a smart guy. It's problematic.

Speaker 4:          00:52:21       He just loves the, I don't know what it is. Hong Kong, you know

Speaker 2:          00:52:27       that's the thing though. Like if you've, if you think about what the messaging is from the top down we were talking about, right? Like the messaging is keep it together. Punch the clock on Monday, like you know, sorted out right. And you're supposed to be like fine, be fine. Right. But many of us don't feel fine. No like range, a huge range of not fineness. That's what I'm saying when I say like a felt wrongness and that's actually healthy, you know, to sense that. And a lot of artists I would say are the canaries in the coal mine, so to speak. Like they're the ones who feel, you know, the, the collective wound, you know, if you want to call it that more than we do, they're sensitive in ways. Well, I don't want to put you in my category, it's more of an artist than I am.

Speaker 2:          00:53:16       I'm not an artist. So I sort of look at yourself as an artist. No, no, definitely not. No. It's interesting actually because most of my patients are real or they become after I get them off meds. Yeah, Whoa, wait a minute. Yeah. So they weren't artists. You get them off meds and all of a sudden they start like composing music or something or making paintings are exactly, they say find some repressed expression, something like that, you know. But if you also look at, you know, like I just wrote an article recently that tied in Chris Cornell and his hurts. I know, I know. Bothered me. I know. And it's, it's not an isolated, I mean, listen, I don't know the details. I don't know what happened, but I said she likes the smell a rat. Yeah. Let's just say what his wife believes that they sent his wife.

Speaker 2:          00:54:02       He took too many antidepressants or anti anxiety medications, but wasn't there like some rumor about him having a relapse? Was there a rumor, rumor that there was like track marks, fresh track marks, CV, find anything on that? How the hell would anybody know that that seems like some shit that people just start making up the annual listen and I could be accused of doing the same thing, even commenting, but his wife who is married to him was the one that said that she believed, like when she talked to him on the phone that he had taken too much of his anti anxiety medication and it'd be one thing to just be like, oh, she's like a grieving widow. If there wasn't like a very indicting body of evidence that unequivocally like literally two new studies just came out this week that unequivocally implicate benzodiazepines in homicide and suicide.

Speaker 2:          00:54:52       Right. So you are the very important finish study demonstrated that benzodiazepines are led to like a 223% increase risk of committing homicide. Jesus Christ, they, um, along with the antidepressants and actually other psychotropics including stimulants. You know, all of these medications have been linked to an increase in suicide as well. So when I hear about a school shooting or I hear about the German wings, you know, plane crash wings, that Guy Lubick like who, who took down the plane, the German wings plane, he suicided with a whole plane of people and crashed the plane. Like when I hear about these mass murder, like menace to society kind of situations, my first thought is what psych meds were they on? And you know, my training basically conditioned me to say, oh well they're mentally ill. So obviously they're taking psych meds. That's like saying umbrellas cause the rain, right? That's not how it works. Causation. Correlation. Exactly. But actually there's a massive suppressed body of literature that implicates these medications, all of them. And we know why we think, right. So we think that it has to do with the way you metabolize some people metabolize these medications. So they, you might be born with a genetic variant in your liver, then makes it so that you buy design, metabolize medications differently than someone else. Right? So you can enter into a state of

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       what's called auto intoxication more easily than someone else, even sometimes in a couple of doses. And you develop what's called Aca Athenia induced impulsivity, impulsivity, which is like ack. Athena is like this feeling like you just want to crawl under your skin, but you seem really chill. It's really creepy, like horror movie level. Um, to fucking boil over. Exactly right. I had a, I spoke in July in London. I did this like workshop and this guy contacted me named David Carmichael and he's like, I'd love to meet you, followed your work and I want us to tell you about my story. Um, I had known about this paper of which he was one of 11, 10 or 11 subjects, um, by these authors. Lucier and karate was from 2011 older paper where they took all these people who had committed like heinous acts, right? Like, you know, murdered their therapists, are killed, their child or themselves jumped in front of a train or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:57:27       And they were prescribed antidepressants for totally run of the mill stress. Right? So like work stress or a dog dying, not because they had like severe mental illness and we're suicidal, right? These people were not suicidal. They were not homicidal. They were normal citizens and they went on to do this crazy thing. And what they found was when they analyze each of these, you know, victims, perpetrators, everyone to look at it, um, they found, they all had these liver variants that I'm talking about so that they were basically poisoned by medication, but before they were poisoned, they were put into this altered state where they did impulsive leave, violent things. So this guy basically gets on the stage where I was speaking and he talks about how he was prescribed Paxil, uh, because he works, I think as an accountant. Um, and he was prescribed it for work related stress.

Speaker 3:          00:58:21       Like it was just like taking on too much stress at work. Right. And he remembers feeling like his mind like slip away. Like he began, you entered this realm of like psychosis essentially. And he started to, you know, to develop all of these paranoid beliefs. But he looked and people told him like, Oh, you're getting better. I'm so glad you're feeling better. Long Story Short, he strangled his 11 year old son dead. And that's before or after you met him after, this was actually years ago and he was not jailed at him and he was telling you about all this. And then after that he killed his kid. No, he killed his son before we met years ago. But he wanted, you know, to share, you know, with the, the audience of doctors I was speaking to like, listen, it's Russian based on this medicated, which is rare actually believe it or not because a lot of times these people are jailed.

Speaker 3:          00:59:15       So it's like, you know, punishing the, punishing the victim so to speak. But that's sort of the issue that it's an important issue. Right. Cause your friend. Right. Okay. So let's say some people, this is in line with their consciousness to, to not have any curiosity about why they're having symptoms, not want to see what they can do in terms of optimizing their lifestyle. It's just like not their deal. Right? Right. So they want to take a medication and they want to suppress their symptoms and just like, hope it works out. That's fine. I don't care what people do. This should be a free country, right? You do what you want to do and practice the medicine that makes sense to you. But the sort of like chink in the armor is perhaps this issue, which is that we don't really have a good way of identifying, you know, it's Russian roulette. We don't have a good way of identifying if you're going to be David Carmichael, right? So, and it's, you know, it's one thing to kill yourself impulsively, but like, you know, those school shootings, for example, have without an exception, been committed by, uh, people who are kids who are recently medicated. So

Speaker 5:          01:00:25       just as a public health issue or coming off psych meds. Exactly. The changes. Yes. If not 100% is really crazy that that's tonight. And when you bring that up, by the way, people call you a gun rights apologist. Well you're, you're distorting the issue, you're turning it to a psych meds issue. When it's a gun issue. If these people don't have guns, they can't commit these crimes. Like that to me is a very bizarre way of looking at like the one science, which is why would they, but it's, it's what you were talking about before where psychiatrists aren't talking about this, this is, this is such a taboo subject that by the time it gets to the average educated and informed person who for the most part it was probably liberal and you know, you're, you're, cause we're talking about people that want to get rid of guns with what they're seeing is only the gun. They're not seeing the mindset behind the ability to do something like that, which is relevant context. This liver issue that you're talking about is this testable and nobody tests for it. Oh Jesus. Clearly apart from functional medicine doctors

Speaker 3:          01:01:30       perhaps, but for the most part, they're not going to be the one starting patients on psychiatric meds. Most psych meds are started by primary care doctors after 10 minutes.

Speaker 5:          01:01:37       And there's a scientific consensus that this issue exists that this with this liver issue that if you take these medications, it can turn turn you into this or take you to the psychotic state. Yes, yes. And you would be surprised how much scientific acknowledgement there is of such quality, again, I'm sorry. Or

Speaker 3:          01:01:54       it's called Eq Athenia induced impulsivity. Achalasia is the, um, experience, the symptom neurologic symptom that's induced by the impaired, it's thought to be impaired metabolism on the liver level of these medications. Um, so this is not like a theory, it's not a theory. It's, yeah, but there's a lot of stuff like that. Like there's, um, you know, in the literature there's something called antidepressant, um, tacky phylaxis, which is the acknowledgement in the scientific literature that like a good 30% of the time they just stopped having an effect. Like stop working.

Speaker 4:          01:02:31       Yeah. That's the thing that people that I know that have taken the most sad that the doctor will tell you, hey, this is going to work for a little while and then it's not going to work anymore. Just hope you don't like. Well my friend who got on them, and actually I have two friends that got a great benefit from getting on ssrs. They had a great benefit and they both eventually got off of them. Cool. They got on them and then their life improved. They improve the, the just the overall existence that they experience, like they improve their job, they improve their, just their state, their status in life, relationship stuff. All these different things improved and then they slowly wean themselves off and now they don't need them anymore. But both of my friends that were on them say that it was a great benefit of that to get on them.

Speaker 3:          01:03:18       So that's a rare story. I would say it's a pretty rare story. Now you could argue that I have a skewed exposure to the population because I only see the people who've been on 10 20 years and want to desperately get off and can't, you know, but I am again, this public health issue aside, which is that, you know, these medications could be inducing impulsive violence at random and like perhaps we should at least be talking about this as a society, right? Right. That issue aside, I'm, you know, a crusader for informed consent. I believe that you just should know all the options and all of the available science and then you make your own damn decision, right? With your free will. You do what's right for you, what matches your level of consciousness, right? Because the problem is that most people are not taken off of meds.

Speaker 3:          01:04:08       Um, and they are maintained for longterm, even though all of the longterm science suggest that people do worse longterm on all categories of psychiatric beds than if they were never medicated. And this includes this anti psychotics for schizophrenia, all of them, all of them. And the person who exposed this and really, you know, sort of blew the whistle on this issue. His book changed my life and made me put down my prescription pad is um, Robert Whittaker who's an investigative journalist and he wrote a book called Anatomy of an epidemic. And I've read it, you know, when it came out and I was ready to read it because and receive it cause I just had this health experience in my own right. So I read it and basically what he says is, okay, so we have escalating rates of treatment, right? Like more and more people, you know, 16% of the American population is on these meds.

Speaker 3:          01:04:58       Right? Good on a lot of your friends, my friends and with more treatment, shouldn't we have less disability? Right? Like shouldn't people be more functional and less sick? And what we find is that the reverse is true. You know, that we have more disability with more medicating. So his book goes through all of these studies. I never heard about one of them in my ivy league training. All of these studies that are not industry funded, right? Because we know that the pharmaceutical industry is four times more likely to publish something. Um, when it's positive then when it's not and they can publish whatever they want and not publish whatever they don't want. Right. So they are in charge of their own policing, which is the Fox guarding the hen house kind of a situation. Um, so these were all non industry funded studies and the story they tell is quite different than what you might imagine. And it's, it's like almost shocking, right? That you have schizophrenia, right? Obviously you need to take meds, right? Right. Well, but what if like doing something is not as good as doing nothing according to the published literature, right?

Speaker 4:          01:06:05       So doing nothing is better according to the published literature then doing something than doing medications. So taking medication for site, some sort of a psychotic disorder. What, what are the odds that it's going to work?

Speaker 3:          01:06:18       So when we're looking at the data that suggests that it's effective to take an anti psychotic there without exception short term studies. So six to eight weeks. Oh. But people are taking these medications for months to years and they lose their efficiency over time. Where their effectiveness or dating effects usually upfront. Not the same as us. The sorrows in terms of, no, no, the story is similar because if we look at our outcomes and long term like, like do you have a job? You know, do you have a friend network you like, are you a functional member of society? If we look at those parameters in the longterm, people do worse. And that's his argument, you know, is that, that's why we have more and more of the population literally getting checks from the government because they cannot function in society even though they're medicated to the hilt, you know, like they're fully treated, so to speak.

Speaker 3:          01:07:13       And he makes this argument for Benzodiazepines, for stimulants. And if you look into the literature, you understand that all that's happening is you're forcing an adaptation on the part of the body. This is a chemical, it is not fixing anything and just like alcohol. Okay? Like some people love alcohols. For some people it's very relaxing, right? Some people hate it and it's terrible and it makes them sick. So just like any other chemical substance with unpredictably psychoactive effects, it may be adaptive for a given period of time. But we know through the alcohol analogy that there's no free lunch, right? So even if it's adaptive in the short term, your body adapts habituates you become potentially dependent, although that's a more complex conversation. You know what drives that dependency. But the longterm is known to us like the long term picture of like chronic use of alcohol for let's say social anxiety.

Speaker 3:          01:08:10       It doesn't look pretty if you want to just stop drinking 15 years down the line after you've been drinking every right. So, but we've been told to think of psych meds differently and when I'm trying to say is we shouldn't be right because they are just chemicals having chemical effects that your body is adapting to. So obviously that chemical effect is not going to endure that. Like it's not going to last. And then there's going to be a cost. So one of the major pieces of informed consent I would like to see foregrounded for people is it may be nearly physically impossible for you to come off of this medication after several years of use. Are you cool with that? Right? Like are you physically impossible and all you have to do is google like antidepressant withdrawal or benzodiazepine withdrawal, right? Cause we're keeping people on these meds longterm.

Speaker 3:          01:09:01       Cause of course we're not fixing the root cause of the problem, right? It's like if you have glass in your foot, we're not taking the glass out. We're just like putting a bandaid on it, giving you a tylenol and being like, okay get out of here. You know, so we're not fixing the problem so to speak. So we're masking it and there's going to be, you know, sort of it's going to, it's like a whack. Like is this going to keep manifesting in other ways? So people are kept on these meds longterm and then coming off them is, I've come to the conclusion that they're more habit forming than any chemicals on the planet. Crack Oxi content, nothing. They, they do not. Hold a candle to how hard it can be to come off of psych meds. All you need to do is ask someone. So your friends are very rare examples because there are millions of people on the Internet right now trying to help each other like survive the process of coming physically survive, let alone, you know, psycho spiritually survive the process of coming off of meds.

Speaker 3:          01:09:59       So that's what I focus on. You know, in my day to day practice now. No. Are there certain meds that are more difficult to come off than others? I would say yes, although I've seen exceptions to that too. You know, I would say that there are certain antidepressants that are notoriously challenging, you know, meds like Paxil or affects her. But then Prozac, which is supposed to be like have this long half life and be easy to come off of. And I have patients who develop what looks like aids. Like they get so sick in such complicated ways that no one believes them and then they think that they're, you know, well you must have ms or you must have, you know, Mano or you must have, you know, some new diagnosis. And in the literature since 2014 has told us, no, this is a withdrawal is, is a complicated protracted withdrawal that is worse than any other meds out there.

Speaker 3:          01:10:51       And so if you knew that, you might be like, all right, well what are my other options? Do I have other options? And you know, since I put down my prescription, I have many years now of experience of treating all manner of bipolar disorder, suicidality and psychosis without medication. And let me tell you like the outcomes that I get today, I couldn't have fantasized about when I was prescribing. I didn't even know that this was possible. So if you know that these outcomes are possible, then maybe you would consider a lifestyle approach. But you have to know it's possible.

Speaker 5:          01:11:24       That's informed consent. Best case scenario. When you were prescribing and d, what did it ever feel like? Like what I mean did, did, did it ever get to the point where you were wondering like, the none of none of these people are really getting better. They're, they're improving in certain ways where they're not getting better. You don't have to the goal of getting them totally better. What was your goal? Management Management. So the idea is you have an issue. This issue has never gone away. Let's just throw a wet blanket on the soccer. Yeah. See if we could, uh, hold down the fire.

Speaker 3:          01:11:56       Exactly. And you know what, I have a lot of compassion. I've, many of my friends are conventional psychiatrist, so I have compassion for people who are in the trenches practicing conventional approaches because I thought I was doing good. You know, when I was prescribing I thought I was doing good things for these. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:12:12       These friends, uh, how do they feel about what you're doing now?

Speaker 3:          01:12:16       They sort of like tolerate me. I don't know. Well, it's funny because, because I have this, I don't know what you want to call it, like scientific advantage, meaning like, I, I know more of the literature, I've read more of it. I've obsessive Lee devoted my life to this subject. They know sort of not to fuck with me on some level. Like, so I have respect. Um, but they also, it's like my thing that I do over here, we have a business, my business given pills. Crazy people like leave me alone. Yeah, exactly. I share an office, one of my best friends, you know, he rents from my office, you know, with all the Buddhas everywhere. And I mean, he's very, he's more conscious about it. Then the, actually, he works in forensics. Um, which means that he works to sort of identify where people in the legal system are being medicated necessarily or unnecessarily. So. Yeah, there's all sorts of weird specializations within the guild of psychiatry. It's like a many tentacled animal.

Speaker 5:          01:13:16       So when you say management, like did you ever take someone from being like a real mess and bring them off the ledge and then their life improved?

Speaker 3:          01:13:26       Um, yes, that is, that's the good summary of, of what I do today. So I see the sickest people that no one can help because they've gotten to the end of the road. So they've done electroconvulsive therapy, they're on six medications, they've been hospitalized, even in state facilities there, you know, at the end of their rope because they're not well. And even conventional psychiatry has nothing left to offer them. So I, you know, people think like, oh, I treat the worried well like some upper east side, you know, woman who's having an affair and she's stressed out or whatever it's called, the worried well, the worried well, yeah, but it's not, you know, it's not true. Like my patients are very sick and you know, I have an online version of what I do in the office and the outcomes there are even wilder, the ones in my office. So you can even do this totally on your own. It's not like some Voodoo, I'm working on Madison Avenue in New York, but like for example, okay so one of my, so I've started to video interview these people as social proof and like it's all about my website and you can see what they have to say about it because why would you believe me? Cause it sounds crazy what I'm saying. So like,

Speaker 4:          01:14:31       so say I come to you and I say, Hey, I've got real problems across all Tommy Brown, super bummed out. Can't keep it together.

Speaker 3:          01:14:39       99 problems. So this I'll tell you about a woman, allie. Okay, so she a real name? No, she's a, she's on my website and a video. Yeah. That she's done. She is an intrepid woman. She's an incredible, some beloved. Um, I've never said that about a person during trepid. She is, that's the point I'm ultimately going to make is that this process of moving through the fire of your mental illness, which I don't believe in mental illness, but moving through the fire. I don't, what do you believe? I believe that we are by design as humans.

Speaker 6:          01:15:20       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:15:21       You know that we feel things intensely and some people have experiences, you know, like in other cultural settings, some of the early experiences as what we would label schizophrenia. You know, there is an elder that is assigned to you to, to shepherd you through your psycho spiritual emergence. You know, we just don't have a cultural context for anything other than full and total complacency, full and total adaptation to this sick society. Right? So just

Speaker 4:          01:15:46       godless of environmental influences and whatever genetic problems you might have, people can have something really wrong with their mind. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:15:57       I don't ever think it's really wrong when it gets really wrong, is under the influence of Psych meds always. So there's very few exceptions.

Speaker 4:          01:16:05       If someone's experiencing psychotic breaks and they don't get put on psych medication,

Speaker 3:          01:16:10       does it go away? I mean that's what the longterm data I was describing for you. It does. It does. So we have turned what might've been a single episode experience that when properly supported for totally completely resolves and you get back to life, which is what used to happen even in the early 19 hundreds, you know, when we documented the natural history, so to speak, of these illnesses, we would see that they would go away on their own within a year, you know, 80% of it.

Speaker 4:          01:16:37       So when they would come up out of nowhere, they would go away out of nowhere as well.

Speaker 3:          01:16:41       Right? Huh. And we've turned them how many people you're talking about Aussies, sorry to interrupt you, but like what, how big is this study? Like how many people are being many, many. And this is where whittaker is like, you know, my knight in shining armor, Robert Winter Guard, because he's cataloged all of this data. It's, there's a robust amount of data and importantly it wasn't paid for by the industry. So that's an important bias to control for. Right? So if someone comes to you and they're psychotic, so, so something to tell you about Allie. Right. Okay. Um, and her video is on my website. This is all you know, fully with her consent that I share it and she came to me end of her rope. She came with her husband from Kansas to my office and she was actively, you know, in an episode. What are her episodes?

Speaker 3:          01:17:27       Okay. Her episodes are three days before her period for years she would develop psychotic symptoms, become totally paranoid and delusional to the extent that at one point she was digging a hole in her face trying to get at like a thread she thought was in there. She committed, attempted to commit suicide multiple times. She had been on at least seven different psychiatric medications in and out of hospitals, like a laundry list of diagnoses like this literally including bipolar disorder with psychotic features, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, you know, all manner of dating back from like eating disorders. In her earlier history she'd been through the ringer. Okay. So she was like a professional psych patient and I was the last stop before an inpatient facility. Basically like institutionalization. Okay. I told her this is how it's going to go. So I have like a very heavy hand upfront and I can be a hard ass for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:18:24       Um, but it's in service of passing the baton to these women because I don't have longterm patients. Like there's an intense window and then they, they're done with me right. Once they're through the birth canal so to speak. Right. So what I asked her to do is follow a very strict diet, no cheating, none like zero bullshit. Okay. So what's the Diet? Okay, so the template for the Diet that I recommend is based not only on like my personal experience, but also on my work with my mentor Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, who was the most best figure in modern medicine. He passed suddenly in 2015 but he for 27 years treated terminal cancer, metastatic like no hope, cancer, literally, um, neurodegenerative illnesses, lyme disease, you know, diabetes all with a 100% holistic approach that was based on three pillars, a personalized diet. So like one of 10 diets, um, coffee enemas.

Speaker 3:          01:19:28       Oh, do you know that? If you heard of it, right? Cause it's like in the Zeitgeists like people are hearing about coffee enemas. Coffee. Yeah. I know it's only necessary because we live in like a pretty toxic world at this point. But what happens is the caffeine, okay, so you're sticking this little tube like 12 inches of the, actually I know and it seems totally crazy and weird, but you do it all yourself. You don't go somewhere to do it. It's not like that. And you're hitting this like it's called a flexor. You're hitting this point right here where your intestines come across and then down. Okay. And right there is a nerve bundle. That reflex is to your, it's called a parasympathetic nerve bundle. It reflexes to your liver and it basically helps your liver to dump toxicants. Like it's, it's a, it's like a supercharging of your livers ability to detox you.

Speaker 3:          01:20:21       Right. Coffee in there because the caffeine stimulates that nerve bundle. It's basically like jacking up your liver. It cause we don't know how to detox better than our own body does. Your liver is charged with that responsibility. So if you can help your liver do it, it's going to be best. And, and this is most relevant in cancer, like radical cancer treatments because when the tumors are breaking down, you need to flush that waste or you'll die. Like literally it's called Tumor Lysis Syndrome. So you know, some early pioneers discover that coffee enemas are critical, like literally life or death critical for helping you flush those wastes. So I learned about them from the master and since using them in my practice completely changed my practice. So like a med taper that would take two to three years now takes me like six months was a given patient and, and Allie, so, so allie started doing coffee enemas twice a day.

Speaker 3:          01:21:18       So, but the dietary template is, is a little bit, I wouldn't say it's like totally, um, uh, people think healthy, right? And they think like Vegan or they think vegetarian or they think, you know, tons of green juice or whatever. And I noticed early on that as long as my patients say to fair amount of red meat, they got better. And I used to be like an ethical vegetarian when I was eating like cheese doodles and Pepsi basically and so it was very confusing to me that you know, red meat could be a healthy part of anyone's lifestyle or you know anything I could ever wrap my mind around recommending. But over the past 10 years and now with the understanding of Nick's metric, you know where there are some people who do require red meat to balance their nervous system, essential

Speaker 5:          01:22:07       actual requirement or is this, can this be mitigated through like a very smart and conscious vegetarian diet? Like if you're really careful about your nutrients and making sure they get the essential fatty acids and making sure you get the essential amino acids and a really balanced profile of vegetable protein.

Speaker 3:          01:22:27       It's a great question. Ultimately my goal in this month is to clear the slate, right? Of all the stuff that's like yanking on your brain and your immune system and driving inflammation so that you can begin to sense what you need.

Speaker 5:          01:22:42       Has He, have you ever had anybody that attempted to do it was so like hemp protein or pea protein or a vegetable based proteins

Speaker 3:          01:22:48       point. I am going for gold. Right. So I'm interested in like massive transformation for people and not just like, oh I guess I feel a little better so I won't even see a new patient if they're not willing to at least try for the month to eat red meat. Really,

Speaker 5:          01:23:03       I'm still a little, so it's all just like what you've

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       experienced for working with patients. But if you ever experienced a single patient that tried to do it correctly through vegetable protein, the job at mount, try it. I wouldn't cause I, you know what I'm saying like, but I do have this online program where there are people who get well on and they stick to a vegetarian diet. So it's apparently possible turn it when she can get eggs. You know in his model there were no vegan diets and it's based on the work of Weston price. You know he is Weston price. Yeah. He's like a dentist in the 19 hundreds who like went around the world with his wife and studied all of these different people who like indigenous people all over like Eskimos, like Himalayan, you know, folks, Mexican folks in South American and studied the healthy indigenous populations that we're not eating industrialized food.

Speaker 3:          01:24:00       Right. And what he found was they all eight different stuff. So there isn't like a diet, right? So how do you know, what is your version? Right? So like an Eskimo doesn't eat coconuts and like a mess. I warrior doesn't eat whale blubber. So like, how do you know what's your version? The truth is only, you know, but like our signals are so distorted and suppress that we can't figure it out. But you'll begin to like clear the, like lower the white noise enough if you have this month long experience of detox. So I asked, I asked for daily meditation, three minutes, um, I told you I'm going to Kundalini zealot. So I asked for people to do that before the podcast. Yeah. Okay. They didn't hear me. Yeah. So, so I, I came to Kundalini Yoga basically out of sheer desperation at a very difficult time in my life after my, largely after my mentor died.

Speaker 3:          01:24:52       And it totally changed my, like rewired my nervous system, literally, literally where now nothing stresses me out. But if you have someone, I mean obviously not a Vegan, but if you have someone that comes to that does not want to eat meat but wants to try this out and wants to try this out with a, I mean, it's really just the science of nutrition. I mean, you can eat a vegan diet and be healthy as long as you do it right. Well, so his model is that there are different kinds of people and different kinds of people and I can explain a little more require, require for, for their health, certain dietary compliments and what are called the parasympathetic dominance. Right. Which is more like the Eskimos require red meat to be healthy. You will not only never be fully healthy, but then you're at risk for developing the, the illnesses that parasympathetic dominance develop like leukemia, lymphoma, hypothyroidism, you know, chemical sensitivity, chronic fatigue, depression.

Speaker 3:          01:25:59       Right? So many, many, many, many, many, um, former vegetarians converted from vegetarianism because they felt depressed, right? So while that's true, on the other side of the spectrum are the sympathetic dominance who don't need to eat red meat and who do really well on like a full force like plants, grains, you know, even a high carb diet and they feel well and it's when they eat too much red meat, particularly industrial red meat that they developed solid tumors like, you know, breast cancer or pancreatic cancer, colon cancer as this is a very common, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:26:37       so essentially when you're dealing with particularly indigenous populations and people that have a, a very strong gene pool to comes from one very strong area in the world, like the Eskimos or like people that live in the Pacific northwest or something like that. Uh, not Pacific northwest, but you know what I mean, like Alaskan people, there's people that live on like pneumonia vac and all these different islands that have eaten seal for hundreds and hundreds of years and have very little access to vegetables, right? And meanwhile, they're healthy, super low instances of cancer. Okay. So is it just because their bodies have adapted and evolved for those requirements with the environment? Right, exactly. That's exactly what your body like. Say if you came from Vietnam, you would have a very different nutritional requirement then that person was right. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:27:24       And you will never be fully vital or healthy on the wrong version of the Diet.

Speaker 5:          01:27:29       No. Just all science. Or is this an anecdotal guests?

Speaker 3:          01:27:32       So when it comes to nutrition based science, there ain't none. There's just none. Because the idea of nutrition research is like taking one nutrient out of the context of the person out of the context of their life, out of the context of their cultural, you know, his surroundings. That's how we treat. We treat it like a pharmaceutical. We, we look at single nutrient out of, you know, a whole compliment of information. So we just don't, I tried learning about nutrition that way and I drove myself crazy because I was like, what the hell do I tell my patients eat? I can't find any science to support this. And that's why I looked for outcomes. So Nick Gonzales is, outcomes are unprecedented in medical history. Literally like 34 year terminal pancreatic cancer survivor you how long you have to live when you're diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, like three to six months. Any of those here's

Speaker 5:          01:28:21       on it. But he's actually taking meds and uh, that's a very, very amazing, they still eat sugar. This fucker. He's doing his thing. Gummy bears and shit. Um, do you know Rob Wolf? Do you know Rob Walters? Yeah, not personally. I know his work. Rob's a really interesting guy and one of the things that he does that's kind of a fascinating is on his instagram. He and his wife will do these tests. They'll um, they'll do carbohydrate absorption tasks and Ketosis a tests and they'll both eat the same things, but he'll test her and then test him. And the results vary widely. Yes. His, his reaction is

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       like, he just jokes around about how poor his genetics are and how about how robust his wife's genetics are. Apparently like nothing can knock craddick ketosis. She can eat like crazy amounts of food and then like a couple hours later she's like back on baseline. Whereas his buyers all are like his body just goes off the tracks. Yeah, he's weird. Yeah. So his um, studies though, and it's a little tests, although you know, they're very small. It's just him and his wife. They're really fascinating to see how two people who are in the exact same household, same environment, you know, one's male, one's female, but also just different genetic and backgrounds and how wildly they vary. It's really, so what do you do with that? Right, right, right. How do you know who you are in medicine? Right? So, so the truth is that you have an intuitive compass, right?

Speaker 2:          01:29:48       Especially with food. You are going to want to eat the diet that is going to make you well, candy and ice cream. It's intuitive. Dude. I knew it. If you actually like take this break and detox, so to speak from all those addictive foods and you have this shift in your body, you're not going to want it. You're going to be with the wrong cause Tiramisu after you have like a nice dinner and you see that on the menu, you're like, come on, roll it out, let's do this. Get that cream with the photo on the top of it. So good. It's gross. So we should've never liked it. Oh, I quit coffee like nine years ago and now I'm one of those ladies. What about the chocolate ice cream? Is that okay? Nothing doesn't do anything for you. Well you're like some sort of an android then what's wrong with you here is into this stuff. So that's, it starts to like deep condition and then if you like really, really feel like something like that, then you're, you're like, what's up? Like what am I like? You know what I mean? Like what the fuck is up?

Speaker 2:          01:30:53       Shit is good. If you ever had like an ice cream Sundae, whipped cream. I grew up in New Jersey. I was born, went to friendly's like on the regular and I got the happy ending. Can you believe it was called that Sunday? I know. And the fries and a grilled cheese I used to eat. Sounds good. Through my training, I trained at Bellevue in New York and at the gift store they used to know me so they'd have twizzlers and dark chocolate, milky way waiting for me every day, every day. So I was like an addict, you know by any definition and you can resolve that, you know, and then out what actually your meant to eat. Cause Nicco we said you will eat the food that you're meant to eat, you'll want it, but you have to sort of get your brain out of the way. So if you have, you know, all of these nutrition gurus in your head telling you like red meat's going to kill you and give you a heart attack, then you're gonna not want it. That's why I demand the openness as a criteria, you know, to, to, to participate with me anyway, the clinical setting because then like I can't

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       tell you how many of my patients were former vegans and now they're totally thriving. Okay. So let me finish telling you about alley, which I didn't finish line. Okay. So that's basically what she did, right? She was off all meds except for as, as needed Klonopin, uh, when she met me. So she had already done, what does Klonopin do? It's like Adavan like the one we were talking about with Chris Cornell. It's an antianxiety medicine like Xanax or valium. If you've heard of those. Um, it's one of the most challenging, uh, to get off of in the long term. And that why wouldn't it be longterm? Like that's the confusing part. Like why would you just voluntarily stop taking something that makes you feel chilled out when you're feeling anxious? Right? But what if your anxiety is because you have unstable blood sugar and you're having this like fight or flight explosion every hour and a half, right?

Speaker 3:          01:32:51       If you're not resolving that, then it's like putting a bandaid on a piece of glass in your foot. It's like, okay, but why don't you just fix it and then you won't need it. So you make them eat a certain amount of red meat. Do limit the portions to know there's no calorie counting, there's no portion anything. Um, because you are initiating yourself into the process of determining what's best for you. So the whole point of this month, this like military month that I impose on people is that it's like an initiation to your own self. So the stuff you're doing, whether it's the meditation, enemas, detoxing your products and stuff like that, basic, you know, functional medicine stuff or the Diet is all in your control, which is why you can do this without me, which has been the best like evidence I've ever, you know, I never even dreamed that was totally possible.

Speaker 3:          01:33:40       And now I'm super pumped about it because the last thing I want it to be as like about, you know, the Kelly Brogan effect or something like this at all what I'm interested in. Um, so yeah, so you do all this yourself though, besides road meat. Okay. So basically food. Okay, so you're eating animal food like literally, no, but listen, it's because tell me this isn't food. It's animal food, including, you know, any kinds of meat, fish, eggs, whole eggs, not just the way it's, um, any kind of vegetables except for white potatoes. I'll explain why. Um, any kinds of fruit, nuts and seed seeds, natural salts, as much as you want, tons of filtered water, that's important. And then natural fats, so like ghee, which is clarified butter, coconut oil, olive oil, that kind of thing. That's food. By the way. What you're taking out is a little more challenging for some people. So you're taking out all this is just for the month. It gets so much easier in the future. But you're saying it all grains, all beans, all dairy and that. So the ice cream is going and then all refined sugar. So like honey and maple syrup are fine. And then coffee and alcohol.

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       But listen, if you were really desperate, you might think about this, right? And it can be challenging for the first like week. And then you start to see the dividends and you want to just have one month in your adult life where you just see what's up. When you control for these variables it's worth it because then you know what the sort of relationships are between you and your personal, you know, biology and these, you know, elements of your nutrition.

Speaker 4:          01:35:24       So what's the general reaction when you get someone to get rid of processed sugars, cut out the grains, cut out the, the non science dairy and just eat regular healthy food. What's the, what's a normal range

Speaker 3:          01:35:36       that sometimes you feel worse depending on how much of this stuff you were eating? You can literally go through like a mini withdrawal, like headache, fluid symptoms, fatigue, irritability,

Speaker 4:          01:35:49       the Keto flu. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          01:35:51       Heartflow yeah, or Paleo. Exactly. So that can be real from the coffee to obviously anyone has ever tried to quit, but it's like a couple days and then you move through it. And then when normally starts to happen is you start to like sort of feel the clearing. Your energy is better, your sleep is better. One of the most interesting things is how many people tell me that they sleep better when they eat more red meat. Like you would never make that connection. Right. Sounds crazy. I didn't mention this. I hope it goes without saying that there's like massive, like millet and focus on organic and sourcing. Like I would tell people never to touch an animal food if they don't know, you know, that it was consciously raised. Okay. So that's a caveat. Important caveat. So I'm, so sleep gets better. A lot of the like ravenous hunger, like I have patients who can't even go as long as we've been talking without like having a snack or they get hangry, right?

Speaker 3:          01:36:41       Like they got like irritable light headed, you know, sort of racing heart. Yeah, pretty much. But like, who is it, you know, when you're just eating convenience food, like that's a natural response. Um, and then sometimes as much more radical. So like in, in alleys case within two cycles, she was completely symptom free. So she went from grossly psychotic and suicidal to not only totally symptom free, but now she's like moved through, is moving through, I would say a process of awakening. Like it's a spiritual shift, right? Because it's like, you know, good Braun says like the, the wound is where the light enters and, and we don't have that consciousness as a society because we think that suffering the wound is where the light, it means that grief, pain, suffering is where you grow. Like it's where the real experience of being human and where the real contact with who you are.

Speaker 3:          01:37:45       Right? So, so this is true even for something like Iowasca, like why would anyone ever do something like that? Right? But the point is through that experience of humbling surrender, you meet yourself, right? But we don't have a consciousness for that in America. In fact, crying, like literally tears is a symptom in the DSM. So, so it's literally a pathological symptom to cry. That is the most basic evidence of our humanity is that we cry. And if we are living in a culture that says, you're sick when you're crying, stop doing that. You know, take this so that you can stop feeling. We have a bigger problem on our hands, right? So I know I can't just sit in my Madison Avenue Office taking people off of meds. And think like, Oh, you know, I'm changing the world that this is a systemic cultural issue that we make no room for things to fall apart.

Speaker 3:          01:38:39       We make no room. Do you know that with the Dsm five. So like the latest Dsm, they took out something called the bereavement clause from the depression diagnostic category. And that means that if you meet criteria for depression, which is what you would imagine, you know, what the changes in sleep changes in appetite, low mood, poor concentration, um, hopelessness. If you meet that criteria it for two weeks. It doesn't matter if your kid just died or your wife, uh, or like your dad. So that's bereavement, right? It doesn't matter. You're still a candidate for treatment

Speaker 5:          01:39:19       or if you got fired or a few experience, natural disaster doesn't matter. Or if you lost your house in a fire,

Speaker 3:          01:39:25       right. It doesn't matter. Right. So some people saw that as like, wow, really a last straw of pathologizing normal human experience.

Speaker 5:          01:39:35       So there's that. One of the issues with these disassociative sort of uh, chemicals that people get put on cause that's like one of the ways to describe a lot of people's reaction to ssrs and antidepressants is a dis associative. Yes. They have a very, they can, anything can happen in their okay with it. It's fine. No worries, no big deal. So they don't get these highs and lows and so because they don't get the lows, they don't get the rebound and get the highs and then also find themselves, understand themselves so they can manage how low the lows get through the mind and through your just living in the moment and understanding. Exactly. Understanding that there's a just a natural process of life and you've been through it before. So instead of taking a pill, just suck it up

Speaker 3:          01:40:19       100%. I mean we don't write like in, in in tribal cultures like men are initiated, right?

Speaker 5:          01:40:24       Oh I've got a video, I'll show you, say really tooth yanked out or you going to like survive in the wild for can circumcision video if you really want to get crazy, my guess. Yeah. One wells, you know, so we think of ourselves as being lucky like that. You don't have to do that though. I sure I'm not taking responsibility for what's in his video as being in any way related to what I'm talking about. No, it's definitely not, you wouldn't approve. But it's

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       true. Like we were just like, we just bb our way through life because no one is teaching us how to, to confront our deepest fears. You like explore the shadow realms and integrated into our own power. Right? We have no understanding of it. We make fun of that. We think it's like woo weirdness that like other cultures can, you know, do in their little tropical islands. But what I have found is that taking people off of Psych meds, um, somehow is seeming to serve as like an initiation process for like thousands today. So interestingly, right, like that you took it because you thought it was a good idea and it's so challenging to come off it and forces you to confront a lot of elements of your consciousness live differently. It forces you to work with your body differently. It forces you to begin to look at why you went on them in the first place. And then there's a whole nother layer of just, it's being really physically disabling in some cases to come off these meds and it really brings you to your knees sometimes. And so a lot of what I think of myself as doing is just like a holding space for that process to happen. And then once it happens, they move through into this like awakened stay. I mean the vast majority of my patients and you know online course completers go on to become healers. Why else would that happen if they will?

Speaker 4:          01:42:20       People crazy. That's why you're turned to healers, but surely a massive blow back from just conventional psychiatric medicine practitioners who are looking at what you're saying and like, so you're telling someone all they have to do is just stop eating sugar and they won't be psychotic anymore. That's fucking crazy. I know you're not saying that, but I'm, I'm boiling it down to that. You're saying that you took this woman and you took her off of processed foods, you made her eat healthy vegetables and meat and eggs and healthy fats, coconut oil and avocado oil and detox and medication and all the inflammation went away. The problem of the, the, the insulin spikes and all the blood sugar spikes that goes away and then the body somehow or another comes back to some sort of a baseline.

Speaker 3:          01:43:10       That's right. And you know, in the New England Journal of Medicine recently, there was a case report, right? 37 year old woman who was so psychotic that her family took out a restraining order on her. Okay. Paranoid, delusional, totally psychotic. She was treated with risperdal and Zoloft and anti psychotic and an antidepressant which did nothing a year of this nonsense. Later she was finally diagnosed with gluten sensitivity. Okay, so wheat sensitivity, right. They put her on a three. This is in the hospital. This is not like in some quacks office, you know in, in boulder they,

Speaker 4:          01:43:44       there you go. After bulldog. It's one spot though. That is a spot. And Sedona, that's an incident. I'm going actually

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       next week. I can't wait to check it out. Totally. So. So in three months on this strict gluten free diet, she was totally normal again. Wow. So this is not like a wellness fad. There are real route drivers, but we don't know what it is for you. Right? Like I said, it could be physiologic where it's like, you know, there's a similar story about a lifelong vegetarian woman. This is in the published literature, um, who became psychotically depressed, was admitted for Catatonia. Catatonia is like the worst diagnosis in psychiatry. Right? She's basically unresponsive. She was so mentally ill. Okay. They treated her with electric shock therapy because the antipsychotics and antidepressants, they, they used didn't work. Finally she gets transferred to announce that hospital cause they were like, well, we don't know what to do with this woman. They check her b 12 level and it's like, you know, tanked.

Speaker 3:          01:44:46       They give her a couple of b 12 injections. And not only is she better, but she's better than she's been in like 14 years from a couple of b 12. And so my point is that for her it was b12. For her it was week. For someone else, it could be blood sugar, instability for someone else. Thyroid, autoimmune thyroid can make you crazy, can make you suicidal according to the literature. It's not a theory, right? You ever had anybody that you put on this diet and they didn't respond, they stayed psychotic or whatever. Here's why. Not a long time because I screened for readiness, right? So I screened for a mindset and that's what we're talking about earlier because if you're ready and you believe that you'd like a whole radical next chapter of your life is like forthcoming, then I, I'm just part of the ritual, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:45:39       And it's like using the placebo effect even, I don't know. I mean, I'm very interested in science, but it is a belief that if you don't believe that this is going to do anything for you and you're a skeptic, it won't. It won't. And I can show you all the science in the world and it won't work for you. But the physiological changes of adjusting your diet, those are real. Right? So like why won't it? But your beliefs can even override that. Whoa. I think that's true. Okay. So I'll tell you about another study. So these are people like your friends and millions of others who think they are treated to remission. Think medication really helped them. Right? With PROZAC. Okay. So they're like, well on Prozac, okay, so they're put in this study 12 week study and they get to either stay with their same dose of Prozac that helped them or they get crossed over to the placebo arm, the sugar pill arm, and they don't know which is going to happen.

Speaker 3:          01:46:37       Right. So what happened interestingly in that study is that the time they were crossed over or not, they both, both groups became statistically significantly depressed, right? So like Mary takes her 40 milligrams on Tuesday, enters the study is still taking her 40 milligrams like next Thursday. But now all of a sudden she's acutely depressed just because of the possibility that she might have gotten the sugar pill. That's called the no cbo effect. So the no cbo effect is the impact of fear or negative beliefs that limit your ability to respond to a given intervention. It's real. It's more important than anything we're actually doing is what you believe

Speaker 5:          01:47:19       convinces you that Krispy Kreme donuts and could fix you literally might be some truth to that.

Speaker 3:          01:47:27       There could be. And, and I will, I would have Kuwait on some level like psych meds with Krispy Kreme donuts. So there are some people who are going to say like, wow, that really helped me. So, so this Guy Irving Kirsch, right? He's a psychologist who's, who's like a placebo effect expert. Arguably what, what he identified was that when you control for what's called the active placebo effect, which is what happens when you feel the side effects, you've been warned about of a given medication and then you feel the medication is working and then it actually works, right? So when you control for the active placebo effect by giving people in a, in a trial, um, uh, antidepressant, but then also a medication like atrazine for example, that has very similar side effects, dry mouth, headache, constipation, this kind of thing. There's no difference. So what he showed is that there is no statistically significant effect of antidepressants above and beyond placebo.

Speaker 3:          01:48:27       And that the reason that people believe that they're working and they are right, so they believe it and then they do is because they feel a shift. They feel a change and they've been educated by commercials and their doctor maybe about these side effects. And then they start to say, oh, my chemical imbalances being adjusted. Right? So it's a, it's subtle, but this is not just in psychiatry. It's really relevant to psychiatry, but it's true in surgery. You know, they do sham operations in orthopedics and it's true in, in even, you know, um, pain management, you know, that the placebo effect is so real and it's not like you're being fooled. So like, you know, like in, in my training, I was taught to dismiss the placebo effect. Like some nuisance, we have to control for it, but it's, if we could, Bruce Lipton said this, like if we could harness this, we would have a side effect free medicine for everyone, you know, but we don't study it. We don't understand it. And we just assume it's like people being tricked or something,

Speaker 5:          01:49:28       they go onto placebo effects. Fairly Limited. Like nothing really truly

Speaker 3:          01:49:32       miraculous. It's true. It's about 30%. But that's exactly the efficacy of antidepressants is, is around 30%.

Speaker 5:          01:49:41       So there was a study once that was done on some, a kid

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       who had some horrible war disease, um, where they, it was incurable and it was like spreading all over their body, over their arm, do you know, this study? And they gave this kid some sort of a placebo and it completely cleared it up. And that's amazing. I should know that. Yeah. And then when they found out that it was a placebo, then it became a problem and I think it came back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, I think that there's something going on with the mind and the body. Right. And that's what the placebo effect is demonstrating. Right? But this is unharnessed and this is uh, untrained and this is very different than what's going on with the mind with meditation, which is harnessed and trained and focused. So your thought is that this mine factor is not just an inconvenience, it's not just a, a variable, but maybe one of the most crucial aspects to overall health,

Speaker 2:          01:50:46       if not the most crucial. Yeah. And again, conventional medicine is interested in this to some extent. Now noticing that what people believe like that, you'll lose less blood in surgery if you visualize losing less blood and surgery, that that actually happens. How can you control the physiologic activity of your body? But you can, that's what I'm saying. Like we have soft proof that it's, it's a, it's a study on power. How did they convince them that they're gonna lose last broad? They met it. They visualize it, they meditate on it and visualize losing less blood. So they have one group that says you're going to do a visualization where you just like visualize your body letting go of less blood after the surgery or during the surgery. And then the other group does, does their thing know if you have one group you say, dude, you're gonna Spray like a fountain.

Speaker 2:          01:51:32       He'll look a broken fire hydrant. You're going to just big gush over the table. You're going to be a sprinkler. You're right. You should conduct this study. That would be fascinating to see if the no CBO affects would have it probably would they? Probably what? Uh, yeah, I would imagine there's probably a way you could mind fuck someone into some terrible state. Right? That so you know where we see this is in cancer diagnosis is called medical hexing. That you know, when you are diagnosed with cancer, your risk of your, you know, the completion of suicide, but also other accidents and your health basically declines simply because of the diagnosis. And that's why it's considered to be, it's like bone pointing or something. So it's Voodoo. It's what we've always known that like someone could put a hex on you and if you know that a hex is on you, you're like, God damn, there's a God damn hex on me.

Speaker 2:          01:52:17       That's when you start believing it and then it could really cause a huge issue. I, that's what I, it has become clear to me is real and we don't want to think about it that way because we think medicine is science and it's, you know, this, you know, sort of impenetrable. Well you know the hallowed halls of truth, but it's a religion just like anything else. In fact, nick and Saul is, my mentor said it's the last really unrecognized religion on the planet is medicine and you know, we have special language and we were costumes. There's initiatory

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       rights. We're talking about the hazing process

Speaker 5:          01:52:48       real in a lot of aspects like the medicine involved in treating a bacterial infection, antibiotics, medicine involved in healing, a broken arm. You know, there's, there's real stuff there too. Next is a whole nother conversation for sure. Emergency medicine. Listen, if, if you know, I get hit by a bus, don't like bring me to my, don't pronounce my natural path in her is going to love it. Exactly. It's gonna be fine. Just go changing my body, um, for emergencies

Speaker 3:          01:53:19       sees that's what conventional medicine is really designed for. We only ran into trouble when we started extrapolating from acute, uh, setting medicine into the outpatient world.

Speaker 5:          01:53:29       Well also the denial of the aspects of nutrition. I did denial the influence of nutrition like this, this idea of the only concentrating on the medicine and not concentrating on what we know to be viable alternatives and things that can make your body healthier. Like not taking that into account seems, it seems almost insane. It seems like you're going to fix a car. Like I hear a banging, I'm just gonna inflate these fucking tires and you know, like, well, what about the engine? There's a banging in the engine. Should I fix the engine? Like, no, no, no. I just turn off the alarm. Like let's just turn the AC on. Like it's almost like there's, there's certain aspects they're looking at the aspects of medication and because of all the aforementioned variables, like student loans, the consensus of your peers, everybody is in this sort of group together is all the unspoken word that you're not going to criticize the establishment. And you can't really do that because if you do, you're out of a job and all your money that you spend on God.

Speaker 3:          01:54:26       Yeah, I mean it's, it's important to remember that the pharmaceutical industry is a business, right? When you, when you forget that and you think that they're in it to protect your wellbeing, help us. I see. If you forget that, which is easy to do, especially because they work with doctors and we think of doctors says priests sale, right? If you forget that, then you can get into trouble. Um, because you take their word for something you perhaps should be doing a broader investigation on. But if you remember that it's a business and it's very lucrative, successful business, I mean, it's the business model of all time. Then you'll look with some circumspection upon their claims and their approach. You know, but our education as doctors is, is totally through the lens of pharmaceutical model. You know, regulatory agencies famously like the FDA, CDC and industry.

Speaker 3:          01:55:23       It's like a revolving door literally, you know, and this is totally available information on the Internet that they're all the same people. So we really do have the Fox guarding the hen house and that's where we get into trouble. If we don't have transparency around uh, a true regulatory body that is not fiscally invested, we're have a problem, especially for presenting this as the only legitimate course of action for a sick patient. You know, where, where you can actually as a parent have your children taken away from you if you don't participate in the model.

Speaker 5:          01:55:56       Have there ever been any serious suggestions that we remove this whole ask your doctor commercial aspect of medicine? Like it just seems, to my knowledge, it seems so crazy that we know how influential commercials are, right? I mean there are so influential and these are not just fact based commercials. They've got cheery music. Go on, there's sunshine and butterflies and shit. And then it just makes you feel like super happy. Like I want to be like these people, they're smiling all the time. Totally conditioning crazy that, that they can do that for drugs. But you could argue,

Speaker 3:          01:56:27       you write that you're just empowering patients with knowledge, um, to, to help themselves. Right. Like that's why we're, we're allowing the commercials.

Speaker 5:          01:56:36       Yeah. Cause it's your doctor. If abilify is going to keep you from jumping off a bridge or make you do it, ask your doctor like had, so you said abilify was at one point in time? The most prescribed.

Speaker 3:          01:56:46       Yeah. Recently it was the number one prescription, I think it was two years ago. Um, synthroids always up there. But yeah, it was, and it's, it's because it's it, there's these trends I guess these stylistic trends in prescribing that of course have no evidence based. But in psychiatry we're really vulnerable to that because there isn't a clear, you know, a to B in terms of presenting symptoms and medication recommendation. It's sort of a free for all, you know, you can pile on as many or as few as you want. And there are algorithms but they're very loose.

Speaker 5:          01:57:19       Well, you're trying to say scientology's right. Who said that? That's kind of what you're trying to say, right? I mean, aren't they like Super Anti Scientology? Remember when Tom Cruise was on, what's his face? What's that dude's name? The Dude's name? The Good Morning America guy. He nail our Matt Lauer. Matt, you're Glib. Matt. Yeah, he's been on out, but an oprah who was one who was in love. He jumped off hand couch and he was in love like no straight man who's ever lived on the face of the planet. He's his love. Now I'm divorced, but back then I was into it. Um, but no, when, when he was saying that on the Good Morning America show with Matt Lauer, he was essentially just saying what scientology has always said. Like if you go down sunset or Hollywood, where's the psychiatry kills center? Oh, right. You know, I think it's on sunset. There's some part of Hollywood people with like electro shock helmets on like, ah, like it's like psychiatry kills. Like, what is this? It's a fucking scientology center. If you go in there, they're like, you don't need scientology. You need to hold onto these cans that are attached to the meter and we got to find out what's ticking, you know, and then they start manipulating your beliefs and that in turn helps you feel better. So there some sort of a correlation

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       between the mind, you know, getting out. I mean, you know, in a way like they're almost like not totally misguided in their efforts.

Speaker 3:          01:58:49       Right? Yes. And I would say an important difference, um, in my perspective perhaps. And there's, is that I believe in like individually

Speaker 4:          01:58:57       also, you're not asking for 10% of all their income and you don't require two and a half hours of study every night. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:59:05       Yeah, no, it does. So hopefully more differences than that, but, but no, I mean it's, you know, if you're a subsuming someone into a, I don't want to say cult culture. How about a culture? Oh, that's cool. I'm just pause before you say the chair called. Sure. Then you're just transferring dependence, you know, from one model to the next. And you know, sort of my bag is to really become people back there. Their power through a methodology that's, you know, their own alone

Speaker 4:          01:59:34       that highlights why that stuff works for people and why a lot of different things work for people, a lot of different kinds of religions and unfortunately a lot of different cults and a lot of different ideologies and a lot of different mindsets do work for people. Even fucking crossfit. There was a great article that I've read about equating crossfit to, um, the fact that people do not have these religious groups, they don't have these social bonding groups because they're not going to church anymore. So now they're going to this gym and they'll like a lot of them literally call the gym church. Totally. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:00:04       Have you heard of the rat park studies rat park rat? Like the rodent? What does which studies on what? So the, there are these Canadian studies that basically looked at the addictive model of cocaine, right? So like you put, we know right, that if you put a rat in a cage by itself and you give it the choice of water or cook or cocaine, right, it's going to drink the cocaine until it dies. Yeah. I'm, or at least, but then these, yeah. So then these researchers were basically like, well, hold on a minute. That's like totally a natural environment for right to be. And so if we, what if we like put it in rat heaven where it can like have sex with the rats and hang out and have like a community and there's things to play with and little wheels and whatever. Then what happens?

Speaker 3:          02:00:45       And if you give them cocaine or water, they don't touch the cocaine and you can even addict them in isolation and they will voluntarily detox in Rad Heaven, isn't it? Yeah. So what does that mean? Right? It means that we fundamentally need community. Like we need each other like it or not. And we don't have that as a part of the fabric. We live in boxes. We don't know our neighbors. Like we don't have communities anymore. Um, and so any time we have the opportunity, whether through aa or crossfit to to plug into a community, we fixed something inside ourselves so we have less of a vulnerability to, to abuse, uh, the effects of a substance like okay, in her,

Speaker 4:          02:01:30       right. It doesn't have the rat park studies so important because so many people will cite that as evidenced that cocaine is so incredibly addictive when they, when they find out about this, because

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       this is a different variation on that study and they, oh, well, oh, okay, well I'm in a rat park. Yeah. The context matters me, you're kind of in a rat park every day. If you're in a cubicle environment, you're in your car in traffic, or you're on the bus and no one's talking to anybody, you're, you're in your little cubicle by yourself, you know, with, and then there's shared suffering that's coming from things like crossfit. We have these, hey, these moments are you bonding together. I'm just like, you guys are, you know, you're in the trenches, right? Yeah. Yeah. There's something, there's something to yoga class like that people get all sot nom nom. I stay on you. I mean there's a lot of that. There's a lot of struggles. It's hard. It's hard. Yeah, yoga is really hard. And that's part of what's good about it is that we need, I think we need hard things.

Speaker 5:          02:02:25       I think your body, if you're just constantly nerfed and everything's soft and everything's a f a free ride and there's no ops or downs and everything's middle. Like what is that? That's not a human, it's not live. It's not what you're designed for. So like when you're having a difficult window in your life, you know, and maybe you know why, like you had a loss. I mean you don't know why and things are just off, right? Like either you have a consciousness that says there's something here. You know, there's something to this. There's some meaning to this. I got to look deeper. I got to pay attention to things. I got to rebalance in different, I got to up my game, you know, self care. Or you're like, this sucks. I don't want to feel this way. And there are thousands of prescribers like happy to open their door to you.

Speaker 5:          02:03:12       So that is really the problem, right? The real problem is that there's so many different options other than what's going to make you healthy and there's so many different ways to just numb this whole experience. Just numb it all down. Like let's put some ice on a baby. You're going to be fine. Let's numb this whole thing down. I, I have been of the opinion, especially over the last few years, I've really focused on this heavily and I've talked about it maybe too much, but I think people need to struggle in order to appreciate how nice things are and also to mitigate the effects of actual bad things that happen to you. If you can do difficult, hard things on a daily basis, on a regular basis, you know, whatever your schedule allows for. But whether it's martial arts or whether it's yoga or whether it difficult struggle, physical struggles where you have to test yourself.

Speaker 5:          02:04:02       Yeah, we have to pull through. You have to have discipline and resolve and it's hard to do. When you get through that you, you develop that muscle and that understanding of struggle and believe it or not, this is where it's going to seem really weird. The struggle that you get in a yoga class is so much harder than the struggle that you'll ever experience outside of that make any sense. Like, no, you're going to work out like this is just like, no, this is not spin class, man. This is something like very intense and not that spin class I'm all about. So second spin are too, I mean it's a

Speaker 2:          02:04:37       bad example. What I should say is it's not like going to the gym and doing like a, a simple round of like calisthenics or exercise or your discomfort. Real serious discomfort, right? Where you want to quit, you want to stop and you have to push through. And that intense focus on difficult things, it makes life more bearable. It makes more enjoyable. My awakening, so to speak, began when I gave birth for the first time, right? Yeah. And I had a natural birth and she's doing a bathtub. Did you get crazy? So the second time I did a birthing center the first time and second time I had a home birth. Why'd you do that though? What if there was anything wrong? I need to get to the hospital. Um, it's interesting because my first birth I was still in the matrix, right. So like I was still eating Mcdonald's and you know, prescribing and you liked that kid less than the second code.

Speaker 2:          02:05:29       You have the matrix baby. It's totally. Then it meanwhile she's like, let's say age. She had to compensate for all my dark energy. Um, so I actually had a natural birth because of the science because I was like in this real like no, it all place in my life. Um, are, believe it or not, I've tried to move past that but I had this ob at the time and I was like, she doesn't know what she's talking about. And I researched like, what does the evidence show ob? It's actually like psychiatry. Only about 30% of obstetrical practices are evidence based and the rest is consensus. Like the rest is just, they're just doing it because they're doing it like the cords wrapped around the baby. Dang. What if nothing, we've been doing this since the beginning of time and if you died since the beginning of time because of these things.

Speaker 2:          02:06:17       So we actually have a home birth versus hospital birth data, which it should be totally unnecessary. Right? But we actually have it at this point to demonstrate that that's like patent. It's fear mongering. It's like patently false. People do get choked by a biblical courts, right? Yes. Certainly. Anything is possible. Of course that's going down. But the truth is that when you, when you researched the interventions you will find, so I had a natural birth because the research that I did on the interventions, things like fetal monitoring, a PCR, atomy, even ultrasound, let alone csection, you know, antibiotics during delivery, et cetera. What I found was that there wasn't science to support them and actually the science suggests that they should be abandoned. So what I was left with was the code of silence with Josh should be abandoned. These interventions. C-Sections. Yeah. Oh, I mean the consensus, even the WHO, um, which is part of the machine, but even even the WHO says they should be less than 10%. I mean, they're over in New York, there are upwards of almost, almost 40% of births. Birds. Are they doing that to save the vaginas? They're doing it because they don't want to feel bad feelings and they don't want to feel pain. It's exactly what we're talking about. I've heard women like specifically say they don't want to get stretched out. I don't think that's a big yes, certainly.

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       But I don't think that's a huge motivator. I think people are really, women have been made to feel afraid of their own bodies. It's the birth control thing we were talking about earlier. If you think of your body as a total pain, you know, that's dangerous, is gonna fuck up at any given time. And you're going to, you know, wish you had listened to your, you know, doctor who's a man and he's never had a baby. Then you could obviously be led down this path that says, let me manage your body. I know better science knows better how to do this. Your body, it messes up all the time. Right? So that's the mentality. And in that mentality, in my opinion, is that you're robbed of this opportunity, like psychedelic level opportunity to have a transformation of your consciousness. Because it is hard and it is scary and it breaks your mind.

Speaker 3:          02:08:26       My mind broke on that day broke, and it's never been recovered because it was literally so intense that my mind was telling me, you're gonna die. You're gonna die, you're gonna die, you're gonna die. It's like pain. But it's more, more than that. It's not pain that you've ever, you would recognize because it's, it's purposeful pain. It's not just a signal of something wrong, right? So it's, it's a sensation that is a part of the process of moving a human being through an out of your body. So it's not, we call it pain, but you know, midwives don't call it pain, for example. It's not pleasure either. It's just another thing. It's another thing. So screaming, because when you're in that intense portal, you moan, you have the, there are these primal sounds. We make, you know, when we're making love or when we're experiencing, you know, fear when we're, we're really in it, you know, we make those kinds of sounds and, and, and there is a lot of fear. But ultimately if you don't succumb to it, you, it breaks and you see, oh that was trying to tell me I couldn't do this and look, I just did it.

Speaker 5:          02:09:36       Do you ever think that if you could meet your old self that your old self bilic listen to this crazy bitch? 100%. I wouldn't even have hung out with me. Like talk to me at a bar. Coon lenient placebos. Huh? What do you want me to do? Eat eggs. The Fuck Outta here. This girl is crazy pills. Oh, you need pills? You're delusional. You're talking about healers and holistic medicine. It would have been the eye roll all total. That's hilarious. How do you, uh, how do you, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:10:11       reconcile that? Because I feel myself like I feel 100% myself.

Speaker 5:          02:10:18       And that is, it's there's zero self conscious aspect of it where you do recognize that there are certain science based practitioners that will be like rolling their eyes at you. Oh, I don't care. You don't care. I don't

Speaker 3:          02:10:28       care about that. And it was interesting, right? So I published this book last year in March, but what's it called again and mind of your own and I published it. It was really weird experience because I, you know, I was total newbie. I'd never written a book before, whatever and out the gate I got like this very generous advance from a mainstream publisher, which shocked me and then it comes time to publish it and they can't get me on a single, you know the today show Doctor Oz 60 minutes and they're used to waltzing their authors who they give these large advances to like write onto these platforms, right? Mainstream media platforms. I told them is not going to work with me like you haven't worked with someone like me before. Trust me, it's not going to work out. These are all Pharma funded outlets, even NPR, pbs, they all are.

Speaker 3:          02:11:16       So, you know, we're going to have to come up with something else. And ultimately they didn't listen and they started to Baz when I, a month before launch, didn't have a single interview, they'd never had that happen before. And so it was cool because alt media, you know, like this, I just called on a bunch of my friends and colleagues and we, it was like top 20 on Amazon within the first week. And that's like the power, like mainstream media is totally dead. And I have tell you that, but it was so quiet for like the whole year afterward. If you Google my book, there is not a negative review of this, like very controversial text on the Internet. Very weird. Because we have trolls on our site every single day on facebook for example. Or you know, twitter, even instagram. It's like part of the deal of being an activist is that you deal with astroturfing and you deal with that whole, you know, sort of strew turfing.

Speaker 3:          02:12:11       Oh yeah. Oh, you should. There is um, an amazing ted talk that you need to watch by Sharyl attkisson who's like a, um, a turncoat journalist, right? Like she used to be an anchor, I don't know where. And so she has this Ted talk on astroturfing and she basically breaks it down. Astroturfing is like what? So the word, right? It's because it's like a fake grassroots movement. I'm on social media, right? So it's paid industry paid bots basically who generate the impression that there is an opinion anti anyone who threatens the establishment. Right? And then they, there are people who like organically glom onto that. So they create this, this, okay, so they'll come on my site by the thousands. Right. And it immediately after a comment is written, like you quack, like, where did you get that fake medical degree? Like you're killing people.

Speaker 3:          02:13:08       You should be ashamed of yourself. You're reckless and yeah, exactly. And they almost always call me it's water account. That's like almost always part of it. That's how you know, and there'll be like 500 likes within 10 minutes. That's like one of the indications that it's a troll. You know what I mean? So like there'd be a face on the note that that's a troll and not just people resonating with this idea that the hate quarks, cause I don't have that many people on my facebook page so that that would ever be a metric. You know, it's, it's not even like probably algorithmically possible that it would be an organic phenomenon.

Speaker 4:          02:13:41       Did you see that thing recently? Jamie brought it up yesterday about Donald Trump that turns out that he just had millions of bots follow him on twitter. Just letting I know where it's like something like 4 million bots. Yeah. Just joined on and everyone's like, okay, what's going on here? What happened here? What is this? These are fake accounts. Yeah. It's like a thing that's, you know, it's not surprising that part of the data that they can manipulate. This is half of president trump's twitter followers are bots. Right? Holy Shit, this is so crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:14:13       So you generate the impression that there's a grassroots energy and that it's actually not real.

Speaker 4:          02:14:19       He picked up 3 million twitter followers in recent days, most of which appear to be recently created twitter bots, screenwriter, John Nivon pointed out Tuesday morning that trump's account saw a big spike in followers over the weekend. Most of them newly created accounts without photos or tweets, right. Tells Herald Times signs of twitter bots. Wow, that's crazy. So that is something that they're doing. They're making it an active campaign. Sort of boast up is a public appeal and is

Speaker 3:          02:14:49       right. And in that case, you know, I don't know specifically, but in that case it would be to generate the impression that it's grass roots. Right? When it's not. That's why it's called astroturfing. God, it's fake grassroots. Got It. Got. But yeah, so, so I have all that energy in my daily life, but I didn't have a single negative review of this book in like a year left in the weird, nope.

Speaker 4:          02:15:08       Says it's false. Why this is mostly false. Since president trump, like other twitter users with large following has a large number of followers that appear to be bots or inauthentic automated user profiles. What's false? Trump did not receive an influx of 5 million new twitter followers in three days. Oh, so stops questioning. Yeah. How many did I thought they said 3 million.

Speaker 7:          02:15:36       I mean, it says as of May 1st it had 28.5 so it couldn't have gone up that fast over the month. Cause it's Atlanta one and a half million gain. I don't know. Uh,

Speaker 4:          02:15:45       that's not even not abnormal for someone with that many millions. He is 28 million.

Speaker 4:          02:15:52       Oh, it could go away. I don't know. The story just got weirder, so, yeah. Hmm. Hmm. According to the image archive images, twins, twitter page rumors of a surgeon. Farmers were great. Really exaggerated. Wow. That's, that's, that's fake news. I mean, it's what he's talking about. Kinda jumped on the fake story, Jack. Yeah. But I'm sure there's a ton of bots following him. I know there's a ton of bots following me. Yeah. I get them all the time. These women that are fake women that want to talk about sex. I come to come chat with me about sex, come sex me up. And they're like, it's all like the worst broken English. Like it's time to tried to have a conversation with them. And that worked out. Who? Who

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       explained it to it? Yeah, I tried to dm them. They didn't ignore me. Who tried to explain that to us that they use intentionally? Was it malice? Was it Michael Miles that they used intentionally shitty language so that if you follow them, like they're poor grammar, sort of like alerts them to suspicious people so that suspicious people don't interact with them but dumb people. So they are, they're a honeypot that creates this environment that stupid people are attracted to it because they can't see that grammatical errors because they're dumb. And so it makes it more effective. So these Nigerian scammers apparently purposely use bad grammar. Like they're more than capable of using good English, but they use the shitty grammar so that the people that they do get are just really dumb. They're not trying to snag like I was trying to sell you the Ivy Leaguers.

Speaker 5:          02:17:22       Yeah. Well anybody who's got a discerning idea of, you know what, this may or may not be. They're not, they're not trying to get that. They're trying to get the gullible and there's plenty of them. Like, why, why go fishing for sharks? We can catch guppies, you know, and get nets fully guppies. They came to that in a way through the net. It's this easy pickins still be able to talk and try to catch a whale. Dude, that's too much work. You know, it's really interesting though. It's, um, I mean if that is how sophisticated they truly are, it's kind of fascinating. But when sort of know this stuff, then you can interpret it. You know, it just helps to be aware of it. It would be a big, big deal if we found out that pharmaceutical companies, we're actively engaging in the use of these bots to attack people like you.

Speaker 5:          02:18:04       Like if you had someone like wikileaks on your side to like dug into this shit and you know Scott, some whistleblower from the pharmaceutical industry that cares and release that stuff, that'd be pretty giant where I have some colleagues working on that really don't tell people now they're going to try to cover their tracks. They'll never know. No, I mean, and the truth is that I don't think it's going to require that because I think people are waking up just by sheer, it's like I synergy. Like people are waking up, they are calling bullshit on a lot of the heavy handed claims of the pharmaceutical industry. They know that doctors aren't helping them. You know, they know that the conventional model has very limited ability to help them and or they've tried it and it's not worked. So people are waking up and that's why in more recent time I've focused my energy not on fighting the sis like some David and Goliath situation, but I, I'm just focusing on making sure people know like what's possible. It's like bucky fuller quote, like you don't fight the existing system. You know, you, you create one that makes the existing system obsolete. Basically. I don't know who made this quote, but it's a wonderful one in this regard that, uh, before diagnosing yourself with depression first, make sure you're not surrounded by assholes. Who's quote is, it's a great quote, great quote. It is. You know, and also you might have a shitty life. You know, you might

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       be bummed out because you're working all the time and a job, it's uninspiring. You might be bummed out because he got an abusive spouse. You might be bummed out because you live in a crime infested neighborhood. You might be bummed out for, you know, you might have some environmental issues that are causing health problems. So a lot going on. You might work in a job that gets you exposed to toxic fumes or chemicals or, right. A lot of variables. We were in a medical system that blames your biology.

Speaker 8:          02:19:56       That's it.

Speaker 4:          02:19:57       Yeah. Just blames your biology. So if it says it's convenient and because it suits the paradigm that's in place,

Speaker 8:          02:20:05       that's exactly right.

Speaker 4:          02:20:08       Is that what it should be? A lot of people, uh, ascribe it to Freud. Right. But this a quote, investigator.com, he says that it actually should go to this twitter account, a twitter account, which twitter account, Debbie hope should be credited with the, it says Debbie wizard, you, whoever it was, she nailed it. Did she nail it and attributed to Freud? That's a kind of a clever move. I don't want the attention version. Yeah, really awesome and attributed to some dead dude who was a genius. I found the site before they kind kinda like do the telephone game with quotes and sort of like this is what people are saying. And then they go through like this, all the iterations of how it's been translated out. Do you remember that one Greg Giraldo joke that got attributed to me online and people have photos of me with Greg draw those quote and something that I never said.

Speaker 4:          02:20:57       It's absolutely not mine. I didn't know whose it was. And then someone had to say, that's great girl. Geraldo's and then people say like, why are you stealing greg? Geraldo shut my making memes. Like, I'm not doing that. Somebody else did that, but I put it on twitter. This is not mine. I think I might've put it on instagram too long time ago, but it was weird. It was like I kept getting them. Or you get them. These memes come in waves. You know, I get ones that I did say I get those in waves too. I get these pictures of me with like weird quotes that I'd said names are very powerful. Yeah. Video is even more powerful though because I think people have come to this conclusion that they can't trust anything anymore. Names are funny. That's one of the things that, but like good solid shame.

Speaker 4:          02:21:40       That's one of the things that was so egregious about that fat Jewish guy and said he was stealing these brilliant ideas and it made him look brilliant when really he's just sort of this aggregator of other people's awesome ideas without giving them credit and he just got on this plagiarism loophole and everybody's like, what? And now he's got this weird thing that he does where he says that he puts up the meme. He writes his own quote and then just puts the originators name at the end of it. He doesn't even say originally created by, he just puts their name and that's like attribute and credit and some sort of a weird way. It's super slimy like what's going on now with like, and the problem is like some, it'll send you something and I have real issue with this. Like someone sends me something that's hilarious and I want to it on instagram.

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       I'm like, I don't know, made it, can I just put it up? Like what do I do? Do I say, Hey, I don't know who the fuck made this. Let me know. And then put it up and then people go, oh, just see what Joe Rogan said. There's Hilariously, I didn't say it. It matters. I'm big into attribution because it makes it like, it's like I have company around me, you know, I, it's also people turn into a business. Yeah. Like the meme business is a business and then they have sponsored posts, sponsored instagram posts and sponsored tweets and they make a lot of money. Like there's a lot of money to be made and people were getting these development deals to do television shows and all sorts of other things based on the content of other people's ideas that they're just aggregating. That's amazing. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:23:05       Well it's just a weird loophole and it's like if you were doing it with music, like say if you just wanted to take rifts that you thought were really awesome and put them on your music page, people will go, well fuck you. You can't do that. This is my stuff. I created this, but we that signature, unless you're putting watermarks on everything, that signature is not necessarily available with mediums. Right. Cause they're that powerful. Yeah. And if even if you do put a watermark, you know what they do, they just find the original photo, put their own quote over it and just don't attribute anything to you because they don't want you to have the watermark on their page. It's sneaky. It's like some weird copyright loophole that exists now. You know? No one knows exactly what to do about it. You need some ambulance chasing lawyers to, that's right. Yes. Ambulance chambers chasers, so what blow back have you experienced other than this influx of trolls and people there is that for a whole year? None. Like I took out a large life insurance policy when I published my book expecting like pretty serious. You could word you were going to die. It's happened. I have colleagues. What do you, what college did you have that have died?

Speaker 5:          02:24:19       My, no, leave that mystery hangar, but it's you think people have been killed because they've criticized pharmaceutical companies. You just have to know that it's the most powerful industry in the public eye anyway. That's intense though. What you just said like you, you have colleagues that you believe may have been killing me. You don't want to talk about it. Obviously he'd clamp right up. It's hard to shut me up. It's hard to tell, but you really believe that. You know what I mean? Is was like focus on this layman, but I do. You're lying. It's powerful narrative habit that it's a possible narrative. They might silence you. And in the, in the realm of independent journalism and media where some random Schmo like me can actually have influence, especially, you know, that I am credentialed in a way that people might pay attention to. Right then why would they not want to quiet me?

Speaker 5:          02:25:14       But, well, they put labels on cigarettes. No one gives a shit. Yeah. You know, I don't know if what you're saying is worth killing somebody over who, I mean, I'm still here, so apparently not. Right. And what will know what I mean? It means like all those whistle blowers when it came to his cigarettes and cancer, those who gives a shit, it's people there make more money from cigarettes now than ever. Less people smoke. So they just charge more for cigarettes and they make more than ever. They make more now for cigarettes and they have in the last 15 years.

Speaker 3:          02:25:40       Yeah, no, I believe that. And, and, and it's true that just because, but I, right, like I'm not just trying to scare people out of taking meds and trying to help. Also showing that you can totally shed your chronic illnesses completely forever macho forever, but that you can have longterm shedding of your chronic ells is. That to me is a more threatening element of what I have to say. Then just like these pills are dangerous, you shouldn't take them. I'm not saying that, I'm saying you might have been told you're broken, that you have a mental illness for life, but in fact, you know, like I have a woman who completed, um, my online program had such bad migraine headaches that she had to be on Ivy Treatments. She was treated by the top neurologist at emory. She was on multiple pharmaceuticals. She was bedbound for two years.

Speaker 3:          02:26:26       Okay. And she completed my program, which we talked about. This is not rocket science. Okay. And she's totally symptom free. Totally. Yeah. So that's pretty threatening, right, to, to show you that in fact, what you're told is a permanent problem you just have to deal with and live with, with pharmaceutical medicine could be completely dissolved as a very threatening concept. And I'm not the only one. I mean many functional medicine doctors and holistic healers are, are, you know, working to create awareness of this possibility. But regardless, it was pretty weird that, you know, the book made the New York Times list strangely and there wasn't a mention of it in mainstream media for a year. Not once.

Speaker 5:          02:27:08       Like nobody wanted you to have to have you on their show. This is amazing. I'm not a negative review,

Speaker 3:          02:27:13       like not a single mention in mainstream media.

Speaker 5:          02:27:15       So the negative review is, the problem with that is that you could refute the negative reviews and also cause tension attention on it. Now let's see what her response is decided to ignore me, which I was totally cool with because I had a very chill year. But it's, I'm your life insurance policy. Yeah, exactly. Just,

Speaker 3:          02:27:31       just waiting, uh, you know, to get my couple million to my kids. But it's changing. Even in the past month or so, there's been like a more of a targeted effort and a couple of allure and cosmo and couple of mainstream outlets have begun to um, suggest that I am in, you know, a dangerous reckless person who shames women, um, who, who take meds.

Speaker 5:          02:27:56       They've said this in articles. Yeah, I mean you can, yeah. Wow. I don't want to give it the claims quick energy, but not funny that like if you give advice that is based on actual studies, actual medicine, give advice about, you know, like, hey, maybe it's not a good idea that you take these crazy medications where we don't exactly know why you're taking them. We don't know exactly if these are the right medications for you, the testing them on you literally as you go along that you're shaming. I'm

Speaker 3:          02:28:21       not even saying maybe it's not a good idea. I'm just saying, here's what the science says that you might not have been told and here's what's additionally possible. You should just at least know, okay, and here's the social proof. You know, interviews, I'm publishing for case reports as we speak in the peer reviewed index medical literature. You know, so this is not like some random blog I wrote. Okay. So just know that that's possible and then make your decision. And guess what, if you're on meds and this sounds interesting to you, then I'm showing you you, there's a path to a new, you know, approach that's, you know, that's it. But actually it hits even given airwaves cause it's just sort of ridiculous. And I do believe a lot of initiated with astroturfing, but I'm being called an ablest.

Speaker 4:          02:29:04       Never heard that word. I never heard that word before. Hundred folds, one of the new ones that kids are using. All these little snowflakes. Good to know of it.

Speaker 3:          02:29:11       So like, uh, so I'm shaming people who can't do what I'm able to do, including have a home birth.

Speaker 4:          02:29:17       But this has been around for a while to sort of, I know you're a woman, it's not as bad. White woman privilege is not real it Israel. No it's, it certainly is. It certainly is. But you guys have a struggle with that a bit more. Perhaps. I'm a conqueror. I'm a man. Terrible person. Done are things throughout history. Clearly all men are responsible for all the horrible stuff. Yeah. Able, this is a wonderful term. Do you ever use that Jamie? No. Call. Anybody enabled us and actually done well in college. They do and they do online. I don't know where I've been that I never heard that term. It's too easy to get by. Sue. Easy to eat. It's too easy to survive is not enough difficulty out there. People go looking for insults and looking for things that are off. Yeah. There there's a constant searching for outrage.

Speaker 4:          02:30:10       This quest for recreational outrage, you know, and, and people find things to be appalled at and then attack them and go nuts over it. It's just, it's a very strange time. It's, uh, I think it's beautiful though. I think it's all, it's all really good. Like we're, we're coming to grips with how preposterous we are and we're, we're doing so in the middle of these embroiled battles over ideologies, over cultural expression. I, there's some girls in Portland that had taken a rash of shit because they're selling burritos and they're white. They, they made a burrito truck and people are going crazy and trying to shut them down, shut them down because they're not Mexican and they're selling burritos like they're not, you know, they're not pretending. They're not like putting shoe Polish on and pretending and that put in brown face on there, just fucking selling burritos like it's so crazy. Its critics close. White Women's Portland Burrito stand for cultural theft. What the fuck man? Their burritos assholes. Mexicans don't even eat burritos. Yes they do. Okay. She's a Mexican expert. Burrito's uh, I've eaten Burrito's in Mexico food.

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       I have had a real chicken burrito in Mexico and was quite delicious. I love Mexico. It's done a lot of it. I just don't understand why anybody thinks that there's something wrong with learning a style of cooking. It's like, I think if you have cultural appropriation, if you have like a person who's pretending they're from Laos and they start talking with a fake accent and you know, and you go, hey man, you're full fucking Cleveland. You're not even, you're not even of Laos to scent. Like you do a 23 and me on you and you find out like your family is from Finland. Like the fuck is wrong with you. Like, but there are people that do that and that is crazy. Right? But that's just deceptive. This is not deceptive. Is it someone who likes making Burritos, they're making burritos and then these goofy white kids are fucking closing them down.

Speaker 5:          02:32:04       And that's what it is. Cultural appropriation. Heroes just shouting out from the rooftop that you're wrong, you're wrong. It's like you said, we're just always looking for who to blame, who to be mad at, who to make sort of the, the persecutor of our felt wrongness. It's that same issue. It's so crazy. Yeah. No, it is a weird, it is a weird time. And the trouble is, you know that the more that we, this infighting is like in some ways a distraction from the greater issues that are sure government overreach and these greater issues that are allowed to unfold while we're busy calling each other names and you're doing it on twitter and the government's literally reading your emails while you're doing it and you're like, no, but we have to worry about this burrito stand. Do you think you're finding it salsa? You can't have tortillas.

Speaker 5:          02:32:52       You're not from here. Like what is wrong with people that never existed before? Like whatever. Here's the thing, here's what's fascinating. It only works if the people that you're supposedly culturally stealing from our brown. Like if you tried cooking French food and you're not a French to send, nobody gives a shit. You could cook Italian food all day long and no one cares about copd cultural appropriation. Like you could be a white woman from Switzerland who lives in New Jersey and runs an Italian restaurant and no one cares. They won't care. Well, arguably they haven't been like oppressed, I guess in the same way where at one point in time we just got through it and techniques. It's Mexican, but it mean for real. I mean that's literally the path of boxing in America was it was Jewish people, Italians, Irish. It was the suppressed people, black folks.

Speaker 5:          02:33:43       It was always the people that were the most economically suppressed that rose to. And then they were also like my grandparents came from Italy and they experienced horrible racism back then, back in the early 19 hundreds but by the time they integrate into society, like being Italian isn't even thought of as being not white anymore. Yeah. But when my grandparents were kids, it was like, just like being Mexican, I was the same kind of thing. It was like you were treated like someone from somewhere else that they didn't want here, you know, they called them Guinea waps and all these crazy slangs

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       horrible expressions that don't even mean anything anymore. Right there. It's so ineffective now and our hope is right that one day it's going to get like that with Mexicans the same way. It's like you can't really mock someone from being from Holland. No one gives a shit. Like you can say, Oh, you're from Holland. Like, yeah, like it's not about Quito though. Like does that, it doesn't matter. They call it as themselves Guido's like family. They call themselves Guido. They'll call themselves guineas, they'll call themselves and it's like almost like a term of endearment and it's power. It's true. It's totally lost its power because it's culturally acceptable to be Italian. And then one day, I mean, but the idea that these girls are stealing from Mexicans where it's so crazy. Like, Oh, there's a salad burritos folks, just food. It's just a certain way of preparing it.

Speaker 4:          02:35:02       You know? It's not like they're pretending we event this and no one else did it. It's a wrap. Like the people who make wraps, those should be slapped. That's not how rap motherfucker, that's a burrito. You're making a Shitty Burrito and you're calling it a wrap. Right? Gluten free. Those are the real problem. Those are the problem people. They're calling it wraps. That's looks like a Tortilla. No, no, no, no rap. What is, what did they call, did they call a rapid tour in? They say it's a Tortilla. What do they call that? Outside of a rap, right? Like when you come up, Dang. Totally coopting right. That's the real theft is raps, but it doesn't even taste like if those girls were just selling wraps, everybody be like, oh, that's cool. It's just a wrap. They just mislabeled it. As long as you don't have a Mexican flag anywhere. And he like a cartoon of a Chili Pepper.

Speaker 4:          02:35:53       It's just, I, I really feel like this goes, I mean it's, it's a stretch granted, but I really feel like this goes back to what we're talking about is that people need difficulty in their life. They really do. And that way they don't seek out difficulty. Yeah, no, it's true. And I think that's one of the reasons why you're getting a lot of this from these college kids where their tuition is being paid for their, you know, they don't, they don't have jobs. They're not competing in the real world. They're just operating on ideologies and they're being taught by these knuckleheads that are just trying to keep their tenure and they're trying to spread the same sort of ideology that they had when they were in college and they never really entered into the workforce in a lot of examples. A lot of these people went from academia to teaching, right?

Speaker 4:          02:36:37       I mean, right in there, just embedded into the system. I don't really know, hey Ho these racist teachers have got to go, right. It's just people are going crazy today. And I think a lot of it has to do at the same thing. I think it's this new found ability to communicate, which is fantastic and it's going to have its hiccups and is going to be some issues and he's going to be some, some real coopting of the system, like what you're experiencing with trolls attacking an idea. But overall those ideas are spreading in a way that's unprecedented and impossible just a few decades ago. Like your ideas spreading the way they have where I hear about them and now you know, you and I sit down and

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       talk about this. Millions of people are going to hear this conversation and this and this is unprecedented. Like this has never been available before. So all the bad stuff, you've got to take it with all the good stuff and it's dark 100% yeah. I like what you expressing, what you're trying to get out to people. This is all this, all new stuff. Like no one was saying this 20 years ago because we were all asleep. He's matrix talk. This is more hippy talk that you would hate 20 years ago. He'd be like, Oh my God, I'm so crazy when I'm older. But that's why it's, it is a cool time because it sorta like the democratization of information where if if you want to learn about other perspectives on anything, you look it up, you know, and then you make your own decision. So it is a time where you have the potential to be an individual in ways that were not honored in, in more conformist, you know, controlled media environment.

Speaker 5:          02:38:09       I mean, the trouble is that many people are still, you know, still believe that mainstream media is telling them the truth, that, that, that deconditioning is very challenging. Um, but yeah, that's a real problem. I mean, I think even though like the trump stuff with all this fake news talk is so detrimental, ultimately it is like you're getting people, even if they realize this guy's a knucklehead and he's wrong about a lot of stuff, they're gonna, they're at least challenging these ideas that these networks are only giving you the news. I mean, Fox News is a Goddamn sexual assault paradise over there. I mean, these, these guys just keep getting kicked out of Fox News over and over again. There's all these sexual harassment allegations and people are resigning left and right. Right. Well because of all that stuff, it makes you go, oh, oh, these guys are creeps.

Speaker 5:          02:38:59       Like there's a lot of creeps even there, like when Brian Williams got busted lying and you're like, oh that news guys just like another asshole. They just make shit up. Like just because he's saying the real news sometimes doesn't mean everything he says is true and there's no way to filter it. So everybody has to question things now in a way that you never questioned during the Walter cronkite era. You know when people were giving the news back when Ted Koppel was on the air, you weren't quite like Ted Koppel full of Shit. Like no one was saying that, you know? Right. But Brian Williams is clearly full of shit at. That's why it's weirder now to follow mainstream media because if you're not saying that like, how are you, how do you have so much allegiance to the machine that you would never question it? Like, to me that's surprising.

Speaker 5:          02:39:48       Also, that machine is the only vehicle for these pharmaceutical companies. They have to sandwich those commercials in between, you know, whatever show you're watching, that's know three 60 whatever the fuck it is. This guy's every 10 minutes and they just sandwich. I'm in there, whereas you're not going to see those commercials like no one's going to read those drug ads on a podcast. You're not going to say, okay, well hey, been really nice talking to you and I want to talk to you folks about abilify. Are you right now thinking about being suicidal and really want to cement those thoughts and solidify them tea and make actions or enough money? That's right. I shouldn't say it cause I don't even know what I'm talking about. You should be talking about this, not me, but here I am. What does this abilify drug blame for? Compulsive gambling, eating shopping, sex. That's just life, Bro. How can you get blamed? The abilify? Here's one you can cause of this impulsivity thing I'm telling you. Yeah, whoa. Nearby a gambling habit costs are between 1 million and 2 million in less than five years. You just suck it gambling lady, stop blaming drugs. The woman had been living in Las Vegas since 1999 but she had never been to town the gamble until she started taking the drugs. Get the fuck out of here. That lady got a good lawyer, she got a good lawyer and she's crazy.

Speaker 9:          02:41:12       They got 200 people in this lawsuit that had off claimed that gambling has to get in on it.

Speaker 5:          02:41:17       I want to take abilify so we can get some of that cash. There was a drug called re-equip and there was a man in Ireland that took this drug and said before the drug he was a healthy heterosexual and after he took the drug, he became gay and a gambling addict and he would engage in risky sex and he would meet men and chat rooms and have unprotected sex with them. And then he got off the drug and was like, what did I do? And he won the equivalent of us somewhere in the neighborhood of $600,000 from Glaxo Klein Smith. Yeah. Here it is, man. Says Parkinson's drug made him addicted to gambling and gay sex. What is that from 2000 what was it say up there? Yeah, it was my memory. That's what I remember. I remember things that can turn me into a gay sex and gambling junkie.

Speaker 5:          02:42:06       Like, hey, hey, what else works good on Parkinson's pot? Yeah. Pot and pot doesn't do that. Okay. It's crazy. This guy sued the shit out of him and one that's what's crazy because I believe it. Well it's crazy is it's one dude hopes for new trucks. I love all the sandwich that now as many as 1 million people in the United States have Parkinson's and there's some new stuff that doesn't turn aside. Oh for sure. Yeah. I like how when you scroll down the video keeps playing anyway. Like they put a little video, like you can't escape the video. It's always sitting in the corner. Like go ahead and press play. Don't be timid.

Speaker 9:          02:42:44       Did Heaven doing this on the bottom? Like where usually you'll see another story or similar stories. A sponsored story. I can't even tell it. Sponsored usually or you can't Ken

Speaker 5:          02:42:54       now on CNN, they have a ton of those on a lot of websites. They have a ton of those. Yeah, it's pretty fascinating. And it's like, you know, you won't believe what they look like now and you're like, God, what do they look like now? And then you have to go to like fucking 20 pages of what other people that look like shit. Now to get to this one person, you might not

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       even, they might even beyond that, you know, lemme just totally wasted 10 minutes of your life. You never get back. Yeah. I mean, on medscape and these like seemingly official medical websites, there are Pharma ads that are, uh, appear to be diagnostic quizzes. Do you have depression? And then you go take the quiz. And this is, this is known, you know, has been exposed. 100% of people are identified pretty much no matter what you click, you're identified as being a candidate for president. It's not like, dude, you're fine. Go play Frisbee and this objective assessment and you're doing great. You're doing great. Yeah. Oh my God, I'm so glad that I don't have to sell you drugs. Right.

Speaker 2:          02:43:55       So what, what do you hope to really get into people's heads with this book and with all this information and what you've gone on in your journey, if you had to like sum it up? Well, it's sort of like when you know better, you do better. It's like a Maya angelou quote. It's like one of my favorite quotes. That's a great quote. It is because there's no shaming in that is as good as the fake freud quote. When you know better, you do better. It's really good when Fred said the word asshole and it um, so, so with this information, is there something in you that's like excited about it or that says like, hmm, yeah, there's something to that. Because if there is, then you should know what's possible, right? Because if you know it's possible, then you will naturally move towards that. And the transformations that I have seen and continue to see, I mean like I could cry thinking about it, it's so deeply inspirational because it's a kind of human experience that is so redemptive.

Speaker 2:          02:44:57       It's like a real reclamation that is not possible through the pharmaceutical model in my opinion. I want to tell you a quick story about antibiotics cause you brought this up earlier. So I went to India recently, right? And I bought some antibiotics when you got back and we never take, I would never, I don't take any farms. You don't take antibiotics ever. What if you've got an infection? Like what? If you've got staff then I'll tell you exactly what would happen, right? So I went to India, I brought my little kit with me. Right. Knowing that there's like, and honestly like I, I don't believe in germ theory in the classical sense. So I know and neither should anyone. Germ theory is like if you're exposed to a bad bug, then you get sick, right? Exposure equals infection. Right? But you know, pester himself on his deathbed said that it was the terrain, not the bug.

Speaker 2:          02:45:47       So what's the terrain? The terrain is the context. The terrain is your body in your lifestyle and you know, in your existence. So that seems to be more relevant. And then the discovery of the microbiome, like this inner ecology has totally, we got to go back to the drawing board completely in medicine because we didn't know that before. We soon as the discovery of the microbiome. It's about like 20 years, 20 years and 20 years. We've the science of probiotics and, and, and understanding the importance of consuming fermented foods and, and you know, super infections through antibiotic overuse and the fact that you can't ever get out from under this idea of just killing the bad bugs. It doesn't work. And so the more you sanitize and you use bleach and alcohol and prl and all that stuff, you're actually distorting things and you're making it more likely for people to develop what are called nosocomial illnesses or infections, which is hospital induced infections, right?

Speaker 2:          02:46:44       This is the hospital as a sick environment in part because we have a wrong idea about how biological ecosystems work. There's no bad guys. Everything works together. It's like a metaphor for life. In fact, there aren't really any bad guys. It's all, you know, is sort of part of the polarity of life we need, we need bad to know where good, like it's that ancient philosophy. So anyway, so we go to India and I bring bentonite clay, I bring colloidal silver. I bring a bunch of little silver. Do you know that as a real, that's the stuff that you like. Do you use like a little electrodes, you know, stick the, the water, the stick to that or you just rely on people to make that forward in a responsible way then that turned some dude glue? Yeah. Yeah. Again, it can do that if you ask the wrong, if you're using large particles, like an Avatar lady, you're having a good work.

Speaker 2:          02:47:37       But anyway, I think it would undermine my credibility. I don't know freaky. I'm super healthy but I'm blue is fuck that poor guy. He does. Oh my gosh, that's a reversible apparently. Yeah. That's not what we're going for. That's why as a diy it may not be the best idea. So does colonial silver, what's the benefits of cool? So, okay, so like herbal [inaudible] like botanical, you know, sort of like antimicrobials if you want to call them that. They don't kill stuff there. I think they have like a rebalancing effect, but there, you know for like, you know, CBO, which is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. It's like a thing people are struggling with that a lot of functional medicine doctors treat. There is randomized trial looking at antibiotics versus herbal botanicals showing herbal botanicals are as effective. So why would you ever bother with the risks of antibiotics, which are legion?

Speaker 2:          02:48:31       I mean they're massive risks. Botanicals are specifically, especially things like oil of Oregano for example. It's like one of the better studied ones, you know, grapefruit seed extract there, Pau d'arco, there's a whole number of them. Golden Seal like in Asia that have these properties and a lot of supplements just sort of put them all together. Right. Okay. So I'm making this story too long. So I go to India, I bring all this stuff right. And one of the women, it's like a Kundalini trip and one of the women gets really sick like Cru, like projectile vomiting and like screaming in pain. Like bad scene. I left right before you got the screaming in pain.

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       I'm sorry, I thought she was just puking.

Speaker 3:          02:49:10       I know it was, it was, she was super sick. Right. And even the Indian dude who was sorta like our chaperone in a way, like a friend of the woman who led the led the trip was like, oh, we got to bring her to the hospital hospital.

Speaker 4:          02:49:21       And you're like, no, I've got to give her clue silver.

Speaker 3:          02:49:23       And I was like, gimme 12 hours, just really cute. I looked him in the eyes, it's like gave me 12 hours and I know her well enough to know that she would be down for this approach. Okay. So, and she was not afraid, important detail. She's not afraid. She was super uncomfortable, but she wasn't like freaking out and like, oh my God, we're gonna die. Okay. She just thought she was sick, which is true. Right. So in 12 hours she was completely, well, we were in the car for a two hour trip, going to like another part of northern India. And how did you cure or treat her? She may very well have done it herself. And, and the ritual of these supplements and Bentonite Clay and whatever could have just been an accessory. Who, who knows. The truth is that if she had taken antibiotics, which she never did, if she had taken them reflexively, she probably would have been sick longer. And she then ultimately when she got better, what have attributed to, to the end of antibiotics. Right, right, right. So she never would have had the opportunity to just see what her body's capable of. So we make these assumptions about pharmaceuticals in the absence of any baseline evidence, information or even experience to help us understand what our bodies are capable of.

Speaker 4:          02:50:35       But what if someone catches one of these antibiotic resistant, very aggressive

Speaker 3:          02:50:41       strains like Marissa. I mean, you know, so, so my partner has a website called green med info comm, right? What is it called? Green Med info.green Med info.com and he catalogs all of the data from Pub med.gov on these natural substances evidence that shows that something like garlic, you know, cause there's a study he put up on on and I think it was like garlic and maybe honey or something you would laugh at, right?

Speaker 4:          02:51:10       Doctor, Rhonda Patrick went through this and she talked about on the podcast, she had a, an persistent staph infection that would not go away and treat. She treated it with garlic and um, uh, in a topical form and it cured it when nothing else would. And she had gone through this host of antibiotics that really wrecked her gut biome and she was really fucked up for like a year because of it. And she treated with a topical application of garlic, which is crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:51:35       And it sounds crazy until you actually learned that there's, you wouldn't know that there's actually science to support that. So there's a ton of science to support natural medicine. I don't know who funds these studies. It's crazy that they're even done because there certainly isn't Pharma money behind them, but they are done. And if you know about them, it might help you to make an informed decision. But this is reflexive assumption that well, pharmaceutical medicine is the only legit choice if it gets bad enough is conditioning. That's all I'm saying. It's a, it's a conditioned assumption. And if you have an experience that defies that, then you'll make different decisions for yourself in the future. But you have to have like that woman will probably make different decisions for herself in the future because now she trusts her body like just a little bit more, you know, she's that much less afraid of all of the horror stories. The fearmongering is the greatest marketing device, you know, employed by the industry is scaring you into what if you don't do it.

Speaker 4:          02:52:35       Bunch of people that like when they do catch Murcia or something like that and then get devastated like the right move is to get on an IV antibiotic. Like is isn't that sometimes

Speaker 3:          02:52:47       you just told me a story where that's not true. What told you a story. Okay, so then what is one but it's one and she had a topical issue but if it's one in you're the one then that's important information for yourself. It certainly is. I mean antibiotics

Speaker 4:          02:53:05       but I mean don't, don't they serve a purpose in some functions sometimes. I mean, you don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water, right? I mean, if someone has some rapid aggressive infection, a bacterial infection,

Speaker 3:          02:53:17       if we only used antibiotics for true life or death emergencies, we would have a very different situation on our hands than what we have now, which is a combination of, you know, devastating our ecosystem. You know, making people gravely ill because they have very serious and totally unpredictable side effects including longterm neurologic side effects. Um, you know, the, the, what's even going on with our livestock, like we are in a mess with our worship of this idea of, of, and you know what antibiotic means. It means against life. Like literally there's something wrong headed about that mentality. And so it comes back to philosophy. Like, if you want to believe in, in war, you know, you want to war against your body, you want to war against and blame all the bad people who do all this bad things and you want to lock them up in prisons and you want to hate the, you know, you know, Arabs and terrorists. And if that's fair, but if that's your general vibe, then it's gonna make sense to take medications like that for you. Right. But I, you know, have plenty of colleagues and myself, we have a different philosophy. So that's why it comes down to it's a religion, you know, it really comes down to your belief system.

Speaker 4:          02:54:27       So your philosophy is improve the health of the gut biome taken natural antibiotics, things like garlic, things like Oregano oil, things that are nature.

Speaker 3:          02:54:37       Yeah, right, right. Get back to the continuum. Like, you know, there's this notion that there's like a, a path where meant to walk, you know, where we sort of follow our, what our ancestors sort of set us up for and we've strayed from it big time. And, and we're in some ways being reminded, you know, that we can't go too much farther without like struggling pretty seriously. I think one of the big

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       points that you just made, which is really huge, is that if we only used antibiotics when necessary in life or death situations, we wouldn't have the issues that we have right now with livestock, with, with people's House and the people take z packs like it's going out of style. I mean they take them out to take tylenol for a headache. I know so many people that take antibiotics, they just throw him down. Oh, I feel so much better. I took a z pack. Like you might feel better because you going to feel better anyway, and the z pack he just threw on top of the mix and decided that that was what was taking you over the top. That's right. Meanwhile, it's like in the water supply now is it z packs, but it's like microscopic levels that you can't really, they're not psychoactive, right, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          02:55:44       There was just this, there was just something I put on social media. It was like studying fish that are exposed to antidepressant water and they became like more aggressive. Something like, you know, fish aren't made happier by but, but the point is that antidepressants are just in the water supply now to products apparently in dosages relevant to the clinical expression of fish behavior. I don't know. But Jesus Christ. Yeah. I mean there's no free lunch. There's no free lunch with Pharma I think. But if you're in a fishing that's good cause you want fish to be aggressive. I mean maybe they don't want to be, I'll give a fuck what they want. I'm going to eat chill. I've never seen one fisher just eating things. Mostly other fish are a bunch of goddamn cannibals. All of them. Um, yeah. Silly, silly thoughts. Thanks for indulging in those, by the way.

Speaker 2:          02:56:38       Um, and thanks for coming on here. I really appreciate it. We just sent three hours. It was fun. Wow. Quite an attention span. So you do not need to add or all you're doing just I'm scared of that or all. I'd had two cups of coffee though, but if I had adderall, I just don't want to try one day, but it's, I'm terrified of it and Canadian study just came out that if, if you take a stimulant, you're 13 times more likely to be prescribed and it's a psychotic and four times more likely to be prescribed Canadian. Like regular people. There's totally different kind of person. Very important. Super important to confounding variables from the woods. They're forest folks. I know. All right Kelly, so one more time to tell people. What does the name of your book where you can get it? I'm sure you're going to get a lot of positive and negative stay offline for a couple of days.

Speaker 2:          02:57:28       Just I do have your back. I'm just telling you I don't want, I don't want you to get hit with the trolls. No, listen, first of all, it's important. It's my disclaimer that I'm not here to tell anyone what to do, right? It's just about informed consent. And if you know all the information, you want it to continue making your choice do you were saying, but I do believe people are entitled to all of the Information and I didn't know about it when I was prescribing, so I carry that charge, you know? So my book is called the mind of your own and, um, the rest of my nonsense on my website, just Kelly Brogan, md.com. All right. Beautiful. Thank you so much. Enjoy the total pleasure. All right, my friends, that's it. We'll be back tomorrow with hilarious and drew Santino don't till then get off those pills. You fucked or don'ts.
