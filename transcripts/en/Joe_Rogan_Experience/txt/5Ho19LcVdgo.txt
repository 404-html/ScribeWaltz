Speaker 1:          00:02          The joe rogan experience, you pull it through as you push it through. It's like there's no, there's no banging on my wrist at all. I don't feel anything on my right one, it's on my left. It's just a timing thing. It's like as it's coming up like you'd get into here and then all in one motion. You should it like this where your hand quote meaning you're doing swing swings is a different thing. Yeah. If you want to do, when you're doing two hand cleans up twice. If you go on to him cleans, you'd have one in each arm and you go like this like that you recommended? I do. The ones I like, I like to him to this, it makes me work both sides the same, what's it called?

Speaker 2:          00:56          It's called project tango and it's been out for a little while but they made some adjustments for the sake of io and it's a a tablet if it looks like a regular tablet, but what it actually has the ability to do is to map three d space in real time. So if you think of like VR generally you put on a Vr headset and you're in whatever university they want to put you in. This one is looking at the actual thing. So interacting with objects is something you can still do even though you're looking at a digital representation of it. You know what I'm saying? Sounds, sounds weird, but like a couch, it's still a couch. So you could, you could like almost stylize it and say you can put like an alligator on the couch next to you, for example, like a completely active scenario that you can interact with physically.

Speaker 2:          01:39          And on top of that they have, um, the other use case scenario that I think they're talking about is like in mapping projects, mapping internal spaces and things like that. But it's in a developer mode right now. So you can either hold it up and do it like that. Uh, normally. And they also build like a actual physical headset for would be wicked for greenscreen gps where you could actually have gps and going in between. But the, the main, uh, one of the main propositions just for robotics because right now robots don't see very well and this would essentially give robots the ability to see time and space similar.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Shoot the whole thing off the host talking about 280 blower. It's small. It's a tight arrow. That's her small aluminum and carbon. I thought you like the iPhone. Awesome. Wow. Yeah, it will be old one. It fits.

Speaker 1:          02:56          Ooh, that's, that's clean. That was all right. I hit a nice sweet spot. I have this awesome background on the gang green. Yeah, that's on target and I'm all set. That's on target. It's just a matter of these things when we don't, but we'll book. That's good. Cut it sharp or is it like a point? There's a point. Yeah. It's definitely a point. Do we want to try and get this done? We need to do, I should bring it up here. Bring Nafa said, oh, get here. I guess. All right. Here we're going to need the big boat book. Said it a little easier to manage a swap your main just to 10 pounds more pulling. No, it's 100% not necessary and we're actually going to shoot those thing. I'll explain what this is and what of those and yeah, it's a lot like, oh, like if you wanted to do this, if you want to do this experiment, this is, no, this is, if not, you know the other one that I to is the most powerful compound bullet point stuff.

Speaker 1:          04:27          You have to order it special from the factory. Like you can't even buy this from the most. You can buy a running count along from a low score, but there will be more on like this is a special order. The 90 [inaudible], the other one got called at nine. It's called point factor to 90 pounds. Draw weight. It shoots 490 green arrows. 288 is one of the most powerful pose known to man. It's like you could conceivably make something that's more powerful. Like I've heard of a hundred pound bows but very few companies. Or is this data? This is all about the distance. This is all, um, this one doesn't have a sight tape on it. If you look at this one, see site a little more. Last lap, the CEPHEID.

Speaker 1:          05:58          Oh, smell the burn. It's barbecue barbecue. It'd be smelly arrowhead springs. She's scholastic. Oh Shit. Yeah. Yeah. That's fresh smelling. Burning plastics by aluminum and it's very smallest diameter, but very heavy in weight and because of that it penetrates deep into the target. Do Lowe's through phones. It's, that's right. Can you get that on Amazon prime? Right excessively went through my pops. I mean, rolling. You're rolling on that one. Rolling. Right now there's a little price, so it's time to do the real deal. Now we have the Sapphire glass. We're going to a teeth bay over top of the target. You Bullseye. Bulls-Eye. Kapow. There we go.

Speaker 1:          07:03          This one, it was scared of flip back. The only thing I'm worried about is you guys the dark glasses on nominate depth behind it. Okay. Yeah, I think. Yeah, exactly. You finished chatter. You, here's what they can somebody get a sip thumbnail. You need to just that. Oh, right over top. The right there. Excuse me. Yeah. You know what I'm saying, dude? Okay. Yeah. I'm going to say, okay. I'm at full draw and then you hit the button and then I'm going to wait three and shoot. Is it boys right now? I think when we, I had one in one shot. All right, here's full dry. Are we going to have more than one shot at it? What are you talking about? US. All right, go ahead and anytime you're ready. Go.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Definitely that didn't work. Yes sir. That's the one right there by the table in a pretty good accuracy and needs further fruit. The next phone, iPhone still be shit out here in the range. Next came the real world to love as well. Oh now it's time to show Samsung some love as well. We get John from Tlv and you said you're not a partial only that let, we got to spread the love and why are we doing that? Oversight and Terry as chair, we need, we need t shirts that say for science this flavor but chuck taping. Yeah, you guys could just, you know what you should do? You should try to have that video going. If that phone works, have a video going of the Arrow coming out and just blackness or quick, wow, that's pretty cool right now. It is my glow. You know what? I might go that sizzling. Right? So we should again, probably 600 military more comparative screen than the Hundred Years War shooting. When you see it go. All right, we're ready. Let's do it. Full drill, baby drill a little better than that. I would say it held up a little better. That's it.

Speaker 3:          11:55          [inaudible].
