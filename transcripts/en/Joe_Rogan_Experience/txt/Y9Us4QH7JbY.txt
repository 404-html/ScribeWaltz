Speaker 1:          00:00:01       I got stories, I got that magnetic shit I did in my brain. Now is it happening? It's happening right now. Crazy how it works out like that, right? Yeah. Well we just spelled the same way. I did some magnetic stick to my brain. Yeah. I can go. I feel like, um, your, your, your depression correspondent. Like I go out and do crazy shit. I did that. I'll. All right. So it's called tr. I talked about it last time I was here. I was going to do it. I did. Um, I did ketamine, which I got to say I cannot recommend. Really? Yeah, I did three. No, actually I did six sessions. Uh, which was crazy. Did it? But the side effects long term where my eyes burned for straight up two to three months every day. Yeah. Houses like burn, like I needed drops constantly.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Like I'm like, you stare at the Sun burnt when irritated. I'm like, I got something in them. Yeah. More like that. And I just felt like kind of groggy and out of it for a couple months. Really? Yeah. Then I did. Um, let's explain. So Ketamine last. Yeah, yeah, well I talked about the last time I was here, but yeah, uh, because I got a lot of talk about you were going to do it or you don't, it maybe I was gonna do I think you had done it? Yeah, I had done it and it was still too early to tell, but I remember running into in the hall at the comedy store and you were super happy. It was amazing the first time I did it, the first two sessions were great and then after that I kind of hit a plateau and, and the, the, I just kind of felt like, just kinda like groggy for a not kidding, like a couple months.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       So the first session you, did you get this positive benefit from it? Yeah, they point in continuing, uh, because the, the, the treatment is six sessions, the protocol, that's the protocol. So, um, hold on. I think I have video of it too. I know I have video switching and not even that if you're just in a basically in like a hospital room. Right. But the experience itself, you said was full blown psychedelic. Straight up fucking 100 percent tripping. Tripping balls. And this is all FDA approved. Uh, it's FDA approved as an anesthetic. It's not FDA approved at that actually know what and getting the. I think it is. They're actually because otherwise I wouldn't be able to talk about it. Yeah, it is approved as an off label a depression treatment off labels. Tricky Shit, isn't it? Yes. Because there's no. They don't know. Yeah, maybe. I mean that's all of them in some ways. Especially with antidepressants. It's all like, yeah, this might, this might, could do something. Maybe not. I liked that. There's stuff that they can do to you that is definitely beneficial, but it's just, you know, your insurance isn't gonna cover it. If you have the cash you can pay for it. Yeah. That's kind of the situation I was in where it's like nobody

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       was going to pay for it, but if you want to roll the dice and I rolled the dice and I got to say, but you, do you think that if the initial treatments that you had the first couple that you really had good responses from? If you just stop there, you'd have a different opinion of it. I don't know. That's the thing. If I had just done it once, it kind of felt like you ever do acid. Yes. You're not paying that. Like super clear feeling you get. That's how I felt the day I saw you. I did ask him for the first time, like I was, I want to say four months ago. Oh Wow. A months ago. That's great. What'd you think? Loved it. Yeah. You didn't find it too intense? No. Okay. Because it can be speedy as fuck. I'm so used to edibles and float tanks.

Speaker 2:          00:03:41       Yeah. That I think it's, uh, it's very introspective. It was very clean, like the, I, the idea behind it, like the, uh, the, the feeling behind it, the thought process behind it. I was like, Ooh, this is like some mind clarifier. It's like, you know, Bill Hicks, he used to call it a squeegee and your third. I like mushrooms. That's, it felt, it felt very, uh, clarifying if that makes any sense. But it makes total sense. I felt great. I felt really good. Felt really friendly during. Yeah, man, like you must have had good stuff because a lot of times it can be speedy and it ends up feeling like mushrooms and I think my math. Oh, combined? Yeah. And you end up with this just like intense fucking is not the God damn problem is that it's illegal. Getting weird versions of it. Here's your thing, here's the doctor put in the Ibmi arm. Okay. Oh Jesus. Just can I say it? Yeah. Oh Christ. Did you take this with the 19 eighties phone? No, that's just the way it's saved or whatever. Why does it seem so little? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:04:53       This is blue bar. He's blown. Okay. No, can't. So this doctor is, it looked like in Ob Shapiro. Ojs Council. Oh, just lead counsel. You can corner. I don't know. Um, so we just, you just go into a regular doctor's office and sticks this thing. It's thing in your arm and off you go. Now the doctor has, he tried it himself? Uh, he would not say, but it was said. Well, he said it with a wink that he had. He was like, I won't comment either way on whether I've done it myself. So all those guys didn't want to keep it on the sneak tip. Yeah. But clearly he had. And so yeah. So I would say for, for the first session was amazing. That's when I saw you. And then after that it got a little dicey. Now what does it feel like when you're in it?

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       I was in a, it felt like I was in a pod, a pod in like a small. It's a small world after all, like pod. I'm going into the on now crossing arms and I would like a little boat just going along through rooms and the rooms I would say were designed like kind of a bit like a, what's the, a clockwork orange, but like the milk bar thing, a bit like white walls, white breathing walls and yeah, breathing, breathing. Yeah. They were inhaling and exhaling and, but I was never freaked out and then there was like kind of digits on it, like the Matrix. It had like a green hue to it. Um, my biggest worry when I was in it was like, I'm so out of it, if there's an earthquake I'm fucked like I, and then I would get like wide shots of California, get wide shots of California and think about like the hospital crumbling and then me trying to get out and going like, I can't go, man, you're not going to have to go without me.

Speaker 2:          00:06:55       Give me 40 minutes and I'll catch up to you guys. Uh, so that was my biggest worry, but for the most part it was just like a fairly pleasant. I just couldn't get over the fact that this was happening in a doctor's office, just like a regular ass fucking doctorate, like literally waiting room with other physicians and their patients, old Weirdos met shitty magazines and then you go in and you trip your fucking head off and so you're sitting in like a regular chair. You're sitting, it's a, it's a recliner, double bed type thing. Oh yeah, it's real nice. They spared no expense. So you're sitting in this craftmatic adjustable bed, um, you, you get the needle in the arm and they leave it in there for how long? Forty, 40 minutes. Forty minutes. Now if an earthquake happened, could you just pull the needle out of your arm?

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       And I was so out of it. I don't think I could have. I think once the drip happened, like it's in you for awhile. So what's the drift happens? You probably have however long. I mean it's a 40 minute trip apparently, but I don't know if it's based on one, if it's, I don't know how much is going in at once. Now that stuff, ketamine is weird because it's, um, it was a tranquilizer, right? For animals events also. Exactly. That's a, it's a, it's a horse tranquilizer and they use it as an anesthesia for humans. Yeah, I've heard of that. The guy was an anesthesiologist. He was, yeah. Don't they use that in war time? Because it's easy to carry around. I believe they have in war time because you can use very small amounts and it puts people under, you know what that sounds like.

Speaker 2:          00:08:27       That sounds like a Joe Rogan fact, you know, I don't know for sure, but it sounds like. Yes. I think, uh, I'm pretty sure that's the case. I'm pretty sure I was listening to a podcast, whether you're talking about various forms of anesthesia and it sort of the evolution of using anesthesia and that ketamine worked really good in the field because you could have a very small amount and you would put someone under pretty deeply. I don't know what if it's local, do you know what I mean? Like, I don't know if you could done surgery. It wasn't like I couldn't feel myself. Right, right. It was more like I had no interest in it. When you on here following FDA approval in 1970, what did that? And Stesha was first given to American soldiers during the Vietnam War. Oh, there you go. Uh, yeah, there's a lot of shit on reddit about, about it as an, as an antidepressant treatment.

Speaker 2:          00:09:17       Frantic for depression. So for you, um, you heard about this, how, I don't know, I want to say if you just google depression treatments page two or alternative depression treatment, that's probably what I, what I googled. Now we've had these conversations before you and I about it, about depression and different treatments. How much exercise do you do? Did we talk about this before amount? I've run probably three, four days a week. That's pretty nice. Yeah. That's supposed to be one of the best things. Yeah, depressions, cardio. But like, I've never gotten a runner's high. That makes sense. Really. I think I have a shortage of dopamine in my brain. Just naturally. Like I just think I don't have a ton of dough for me. Like I don't. Joy is not a thing I think I've ever experienced. What I repeat, joy is the thing that I don't think I've ever experienced.

Speaker 2:          00:10:07       I'll experience adrenaline rushes and like ego, but I'll never be truly like Julius. Yeah, it stinks. It fucking stinks because it's something I'm, I, I, I believe in. I just don't. I've accomplished things I've done, you know what I mean? But I never get this sense of like this real, you know, in very small doses, vic streaming like micro doses. So like let me put into perspective like career wise. So yeah, you had a nice comedy central special to put a lot of hype behind it. You did. I watched, he did really well. Got a great response. How'd you feel when all that was over? I felt cool. Cool. Do you know what I mean? Like, yeah, exactly. Like all. Alright, good shit man. Keep going. See what else? But it was never like during Chappelle show, I never got like A. I'm the king of the world, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:10:58       Never that sort of like huge, uh, you know, something that would make you want to scream. You feel so good. Do you get that much all day? Twenty four slash seven. I just hold it and try not to scream if you want to take a break. If you want to go up on the roof. I'm the worst guy to talk to this about because I don't really, I don't really get depressed. I've been depressed before. But answer my question, the join question. I'm joyful all the time. You. That wasn't a joke. You've really. I'm pretty happy. That's great. You. Here's a good enough. You seem happy. Yeah. Like I don't. I buy it. I'm not letting his fucking Joe. Joe Rogan thinks he's happy. You seem happy. I have a lot of friends. Yeah. Like that's a big part of it. You know, a lot of cool friends.

Speaker 2:          00:11:39       Love. Uh, I love having a family. Love what I do. Like my jobs. My day is filled with stuff I enjoy doing. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's just fucking. I'm just lucky. Yes, we provide, but I have many of the same things. I just don't feel that. That sense of satisfaction you have now. Has it varied? Have you had higher and lower feelings of satisfaction? Yeah, I think when I'm working a lot I feel pretty satisfied. Oh, okay. Um, okay. So accomplishments or task? Task and goal oriented. Like I like it's satisfying to do a special or direct to commercial or, or, or write a TV show or you know. Well, I'll tell you one thing, I say I'm filled with joy and I'm happy all the time when I'm not working or I'm not accomplishing anything or I'm not doing it. Like if I get real lazy, I can get depressed.

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       Somebody else told me that they said that a very, very joyous guy told me when he gets injured, he just takes it out of him. Ken, I've been injured a gang of times. I've had a bunch of surgeries from, um, you know, athletic injuries. But um, for me, uh, if I go into lowe's, like if I'm not accomplishing things or in the past I don't allow myself to get into those anymore because it's just not a good feeling. And even, it doesn't even necessarily have to be like a career, like oriented thing. But I have to have things that I'm enjoying. Yeah. It could just be like I'm really into doing yoga, doing yoga every day, and now it's, I do it, I get it done and now I feel great and yeah, but if I'm not doing something I, my brain for whatever reason, needs tasks, it needs stuff to do.

Speaker 2:          00:13:22       And need stuff to figure out. It needs like puzzles. Yeah. If I don't get that, I have real issue. Yeah, agreed. Do you like big longterm goals? It's just like. Yeah, you do. Yeah, I'd like to it or micro thing. I like. I like those too. I like things that are due in like a week as opposed to something that's like, yeah, whenever you're like, I'm outlining a movie right now. And I'm like, yeah, but I don't. I wish it were more like bang, Bang. Yeah. Like I'm meeting about it tomorrow, like specifically to, to kind of focus myself. Like you write a joke and then you go up and do it tonight and it kills like. Yeah. Yeah. Oh that's okay. That's something that, that's joy. That's pretty telling their joy. Yeah. Or just writing a joke. Writing a joke that it. And it kills. It's like that feeling, man.

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       Don't you wish you could give that to people who don't do standup? I it, I've, I've had this conversation with people before that don't do stand up and like, man, I wish I could tell you what it's like to crush in front of people finding 100,000 dollars. Do you know what I mean? That's how it feels. It feels like, oh, I just found 100,000 dollars and you know, what led me there, my personality and my experience and your work ethic and your work at. That's exactly right. So it's like you feel like, oh, this is so. It's so personal. Yeah, it feels like this could only, if it's a good joke, only you could have written it, you know. Well, uh, even if other people could have written it, you wrote it like this, this thing came out of which sky and out of your shows you.

Speaker 2:          00:14:55       Yeah, yeah, yeah. It shows you, yeah, whatever it is. Uh, so that I, that I will say is like, that's, that's a sense of euphoria. But I think in some ways I try to kind of contain it a little bit in that where I'm like, Whoa, you know what I mean? Like with this thing, I don't know what to do with this feeling because it's the kind of thing where you just want to like go up and kiss women and smack you on the ass and would just fucking wrote a kid, wrote a fucking closer. What do you mean? Like you just feel like, like a, like a musical. Tony Hinchcliffe had this new joke and uh, he did it. He and he came off stage like right after he didn't. And he was literally like, like fist pumping. Like he was just so fired up because it killed so fired up.

Speaker 2:          00:15:44       It's like he was charged with electricity. Yeah. That's nice when you can allow yourself to just like, yeah. And nobody gets. You can do it in a way that no one gets jealous or feels like your, your prenatal to hang out with better people were hanging out with basically the same. But I'm saying like, if that's the problem. Yeah. You know, and I've, we've all been there before too, like the way things are going well and you're hanging around with someone and they get super weird and creepy with you. And they withdraw and you're like, oh yeah, yeah. What do you get? What? You just kind of like, what do you want me to do? You want me to fail? Well, there's people that do definitely want you to fail, but what they definitely don't want you to do is highlight the fact that they're not succeeding.

Speaker 2:          00:16:20       Well. Yeah. But that's what most people consider. A lot of people consider your success. They'll their failure. That's such a bizarre way of looking at it. I know. It's so common though. Like what evolutionary benefit does that have? Well, finite resources. Yeah. I think that's what it comes from. I think it just comes from there. You know, when people go, oh, there's enough jobs for everyone. You and I both know. No, there's not. No. There's enough jobs for talented people, but if you don't feel like you're talented, then you are fucking. Yeah. Panicked all the time. And then it's a, it's a self fulfilling prophecy because that sort of famine thinking is really bad for progress. If you are a person who's really worried about other people getting things and you start thinking in a jealous man or about other people's success, that fucks up your own ability to express yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:17:12       Yeah, and that fucks up your ability to succeed. It depends on how it hits you. It can. It can be a motivator, I believe. Sure. Definitely. Where you're like, fucking, he got it. You know, I can't get whatever that is, but it's hard to. You got to kind of wrestle it into a positive way because if you get upset at somebody else got something, then usually it's a bitter motivator and it doesn't lend itself to success, but I've never, I've, I don't think I've ever had something where I was like, this should have been mine. Do you know what I mean? Like one. Have you ever had that where it was like a job, a, you were like, definitely when I was younger for sure. What sorts of things were they?

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       I'm sure looking back to their absurd, absurd things that I didn't deserve. You know, like someone else getting a television show or someone else headlining a certain place and it's for comics. There really is not, it's not a finite situation. It's not like there's a limited amount of resources. There's so many different clubs and there's so many different topics and there's so many different jobs. I mean, I think that's one of the reasons why comics are so ruthless when it comes to plagiarism because like say if you have a really unique idea and this idea is come to you from the universe when you're sketching it out and putting it together and some fucker comes in and sees this and says, ah, I can, I can

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       bad jokes as interventions and it's like, you stole my fucking invention. That's my invention dude. Like I don't my inventions or word inventions or premise inventions or whatever. Like, so it's intellectual property, you know, like you know that that's mine. So to steal it is, is worse than plagiarism. It's like copyright infringement. It's like it's. Yeah. It's like, it's, it's, it's unforgivable.

Speaker 3:          00:18:58       It also cuts in and creates that weird competitive finite resources mentality. It creates, it creates like a mind fuck because then all of a sudden you start thinking like, oh, well this is, this is not like a community of likeminded people. They're supporting each other. There's like some parasites in here and there's some, some vampires

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       with different standards because we all more or less have, I don't know if it's learned in the comedy community or, or we all come into it with certain standards, but there is that thing of like there's an acceptable, you know what I mean? Like it's almost like not closing with a super dirty joke if the person after you isn't a dirty comic, you know what I mean? Like there's just certain you care about them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's certain unwritten rules that you want to do. Lottery. Yes. That you don't want to fuck people over and then when somebody else does some shit like that and you're like, wait a minute. Um, but the way I've thought of it, it's like one was right. Another one. I mean obviously it's the worst and it's unforgivable. But like I've had people steal shit from me.

Speaker 3:          00:20:03       Yeah. It's going to happen, but it fucks up the best part about standup, like last night at the store was hanging around with a stand hope and Michael costs and all these guys and we're just laughing and hanging around. There's a cool concept.

Speaker 1:          00:20:17       Great. Lately, Michael Cost has been like hit his stride that the kind of jokes he's writing are fucking great. Very Funny Guy and really nice guy too. Like such a sweet guy. Yeah. But that place is filled with that kind of cool comradery. That's the point to me. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Like that's really like the fun of it. Yeah. Like, like what you've done with your people and other comics and like your, like your group of the dense whenever you want to call it, but like, but, but that's the point of like that's my favorite part of it and it's,

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       there's no close second, not money. It's not. It's literally like a vibe and it's connecting with somebody. Yeah, I agree. It's all hugs. You know, you go to the store on an any given night. It's all hugs. It's a whole bunch of guys that appreciate each other and girls, you know, will really funny get together and that place right now is, it's hotter than it's ever been last night. Tuesday nights sold out and pack main original room and belly room. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. By the way. It should be. Yeah. That shows are fucking bananas. The shows at the comedy store, our fundraisers anywhere else in the world. Yeah. But here it's just like White Joey Diaz, Duncan Trussell, Ari. I mean, it's fucking crazy. The lineups. Bang, Bang, Bang. You just see killer after killer Ian Edwards. Shit. Yeah. Jeselnik. Oh my God. All the time. It's, the lineups are amazing, but it's also like the feel like you feel like, man, I think we're in a golden era.

Speaker 2:          00:21:47       Yeah. Like it feels like, wow, we're really lucky to be here. Right? Yeah. I mean, yeah, there are guys like you that almost created it in a way like by going back to the store and by validating it and then you, your fans go and then it's like a self fulfilling thing. But. But yeah, it definitely feels like, I don't know what I feel like. Although did you watch the roast? The roast battle? Yeah, I thought it was fucking great. I didn't watch on comedy central. Oh No, it was in part of it I think was in Montreal. No, I was in the part that was in the belly room or they feel they did a special that I didn't watch. There's five. There's five parts that they did for Montreal and it hurt. It was really great. It was great. Like the relative may get Ralphie.

Speaker 2:          00:22:26       I heard he took a beating. He got. Yeah, he saw us. But again, it's an entire career flashed in front of his eyes. But what do you expect when you're doing a row? It's like, I know if I do a roast, people are going to fucking kill me on Chappelle repeatedly, of course. So on now I'm just like, all right, let's judge this level of how hard you're going to hit a. So Ravi got hit on a weight joke, which is weight in his divorce, his family. Oh right, that's hardcore. Yeah. Family like left him. Yeah. So he's alone. He's fat. Yeah. Depressed. And then someone just kept teeing off on him. Who is he? Roasted A. wasn't Mike Lawrence. Mike Lawrence. Who one is really funny. Yeah. He's a really funny dude. But apparently Ralph, he just didn't take it so well. Yeah. Well I'm happy to take a swing at him.

Speaker 2:          00:23:20       Wasn't that close? It was like, you know, it had that even on tv it was that feeling of like, oh, I would, I could see this going to go in a certain way. It's, I don't want to do that. I don't want to say that to people. I don't want to say anything that's going to make money. I definitely don't want anybody saying that to me. That's going to make me feel like there's a zoom in on Ralphie's face and you as you're watching it, you're like, did they zoom in or designs zoom in in zoom in or did they do that? There is a god damn brutal show. Yeah. But good for comedy man. Really good format. It's a cool format. They figured out a new format and they joke writer format. It's like it's fair and he's like literally just like head to head and it rewards good joke.

Speaker 2:          00:24:09       They laugh at the. It's like it's like a Madison Square Garden. They say people know basketball. They're like NBA players say people know basketball. Like they. That's how it feels at the roast battle. Like people know comedy and they reward high, high level of difficulty jokes. Yes. I, I agree. And also I think one of the things that rose pedals really good for comedy is it's pushing the boundaries of acceptable jokes. Yeah. And this is a weird time where people are fucking, you know, this whole idea about punching up and there's so much horseshit involved in like what is and is not acceptable and stand up today. Yeah. And it's, it's a bunch of people that are trying to control behavior and thinking and that just doesn't fly in that world. It's the pushback like what Bros battle is the pushback to this pc era that we're in right now.

Speaker 2:          00:25:00       If they could prove to me that joking leads to action, I would pay more attention. Do you know what I mean? Like isn't right now, but if they could say, yeah, Hitler made a lot of jokes about invading Australia before you used to do tons of bits about Austria and then eventually he brought the hammer down. Like if you could prove some sort of, some sort of, you know, the A and B, a plus b equals c, then yeah. Then it's like, okay, I agree, but you also know that that racism and all that shit is like. It ain't about joking. It's about like a, it's about, a lot of times it's about poverty. It's class, it's so many other things that aren't, that aren't necessarily comedy. Yeah. And, and even poverty of ideas. I mean it's a, it's a thought process. Poverty. It's poor thing.

Speaker 2:          00:25:50       Yes. Yeah. I mean that's what racism really is and what jokes are, is like, you know, that there's a certain amount of racism and you play on it and there's a, there's a wink as you're doing it, like in a joke form and there's some racist shit that people can say to each other and that joke battle of the roast battle. That is fucking hilarious. Yes. Yeah. There were black people can't swim to nine slash 11 off the fucking tons of nine slash 11 jokes. George Perez and Sarah Tiana. We're roasting and Sarah Tiana was roasting him about Sarah. Tiana is insanely good at that shit. She's like one of those things where it's like someone can talk real fast summary. You're like, I didn't even know you could do this shit. She's like double jointed or something like, wait, what you can do there. You can do the splits.

Speaker 2:          00:26:35       All right. It comes off even crazier because she's so sweet and she's got this smiling face and I believe yes. You know what I mean? Like there is no hatred in her. In her roast. No. No, but she knows. She knows where the soft spots are and that's where she sticks. The blade. Did she came in second? She almost, she just kind of ran out of steam. Like she just, it was later. Right. A lot of jokes. Oh yeah man. It's brutal. So yeah. But she, she. Sarah, congrats to Sarah. So Hinchcliffe did it with a suit of armor on. Yes. And would have won but fucked up his last joke. Maybe it was really close and his last job was a clunker. I think his first joke in his last joke, but hence is good at that shit too. Oh, he's really good at it.

Speaker 2:          00:27:24       He just. Cliff is mean. He knows. He knows that a certain guy that he means what he says. He's up there. He's doing a documentary. He's not. He's doing a documentary about his thoughts. It's not a lot of like there's art to it, but it's like, oh, this is all based on a true story. Yeah. Well I'm just happy that comedy central is taken. That's a big chance. And they've taken quite a few big chances recently. Like I think with Ari Shadow Arusha fear show this is not happening. Yeah. That was a big chance. Yeah. That show is really racy really out there. Some of the stories are fucking completely outrageous. So they've got that and then they're taking chances with this as well. And it's, you know, it's off the beaten path. This is a new thing. This is not like another guy's doing a talk show.

Speaker 2:          00:28:12       Oh Great. I think they're following the sort of what's working alive. Yes. And smartly going, how do we televise it, because the truth about comedy central is the ratings are so bad at this point that they, relative to what they were, that I think they're like, it's Kent Alterman just going like, I like that. Let's do that. Right. And leaving shows on that are not particularly highly rated because he likes it. If they do that though, I think that's the right way to go. If they just find what people actually enjoy that like, like la right now has a comedy scene, a big comedy scenes and roast battle is one of the highlights of the comedy scene. Everybody goes to see it, man last night. There's a fucking line like Rosebelle start at midnight. Yeah. I got there at 10 and the line was already around the fucking outside of the uh, patio, the store all waiting to get in because I think people didn't know about it until this week.

Speaker 2:          00:29:04       Literally the TV, the show. Yeah. That definitely had an impact, but it's, it's cool to see. It's cool. It's great. It's fair. Yeah, it's what it is. It's like, okay, this is fucking, there's a little goddamn justice right here. Like a funny thing that people were doing live and I think like famous people, judges helps, but for the most part it's just, it's funny to watch. It's fun to watch these people go head to head. I heard the Whoopi Goldberg was awful. Uh, she was just like, why are you making that face? Yeah, I would agree. A wifi was never like a comic. Do you know what I mean? Well, will people was a comic. It wasn't really real. They're not like a club comics. Yeah. But I, to me she did that one woman show which was in a theater was not stand up. And then she did comic relief where she was doing a monologue with two other dudes.

Speaker 2:          00:29:55       I'm pretty sure she did comedy clubs to. Okay. Maybe. Well pretty sure I saw her. Sometimes Joe things pass you by and a certain certain shit. It's like you kinda. When she was going back and forth with Jessalyn neck and she just said, I have Oscars. Yeah. She's like, all the shit I got and jasmine was like a bunch of shit from the eighties was just like, well that doesn't make you funny either. Oh, exactly. Exactly. It's like, yeah, you brought up, you brought up. You brought up an Oscar to a comedy show because it not only that, it's the opposite of being funny. Like talking about your accomplishments is the opposite of like a good comeback. Yeah. Like somebody, somebody said that they were an argument with somebody and the person goes, I have a million dollars.

Speaker 2:          00:30:41       Like, okay, buy your way out of this fucking conversation. Well, if someone calls you a loser fucking loser, and you're like, well, I'm actually one. Yeah, there are no, I'm not saying you should never bring up. Bring up having a million dollars. Like if someone says you broke, you broke motherfucker. Yeah. You can't be like actually have a lot of money. I can't say that. There are certain things in which I've succeeded. Um, so yeah, so, you know, but the swordsman it's fucking, it's cool. It's magical again. Yeah. Well not even that. Again, like I've been there on and off for 20 plus years. It's never been as good as it is now. No, and it's because it's the right way. It's Adam's book and good people. He's not booking. He's not booking like viruses. You know what I mean? He's not booking people that when you're on the show with them, you're like, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       Am I only getting two spots or how am I only getting four spots and this guy's getting whatever. Like where you see a guy that just kind of is a bummer, comedically. Like that has no merit, right? That has no merit whatsoever. Comedically. And they used to have that because I think there was just a lot of people left over from like the eighties. There was, there was some weird. A lot of legacy acts. Yeah, that's a good way to put it. Yeah. Yeah. But now there's like, there's young people coming up that are really funny. There's guys like Ron White who really established who love hanging out there now is there all the time now and it's cool. He's like a part of the community now. You're there, a lot of birds there, a lot jeselnik lot dave, when he's in town, Chappelle, we and that backbar too. God Damn. We were at the back bar less and I'm like, how fun is this place? Just makes you feel like tingling when you're there. Yeah, yeah. It feels like you're in a movie about this time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fucking awesome. That's awesome. Um, yeah, so, so I did the uh, I did that so that the ketamine, I will say I will, I will say I cannot recommend, but you recommended for one

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       session.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       I, I look, ketamine is a drug as interesting as fuck the thing that I felt the day I saw, you may have just been that, that lsd hangover feeling that hangover of like the where you're not hung over, but you're not yourself. You feel like that, that like high pitched clarity that like squeak. So I can't. But beyond that it just became. Now I complained to the guy and he said, you're the only person who's ever felt like this. Um, the. Yeah, the, the Ad, a little nausea as well. I'm 100 of those balls, but they're awesome. Yeah. Amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:33:18       This is a wad workout of the day. I think the it Wad supernova. This is the tiny one. There's a little one. The big one is actually better. Yeah. But you stick it on your back.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       Oh yeah. You can use it on your head ever. Now. Did you got shit in your head? You got muscles in your head. You don't even know, bro. You got muscles. You don't even know my bro Bro. My head is yoked a row. You gotta everybody knows that about you. My fucking head is really. I bet you have like weird shit up there. Um, so. So yeah, so I did the academy, didn't, can't recommend it. Then I tried something called tms, which is short for transcranial magnetic stimulation. Joe, I've got a video and it's going to be full frame. Oh, Jamie, you'll put it up on the big screen. Oh yeah. How do I send it? Uh, yeah, that's probably the best way. Okay. Hold on.

Speaker 4:          00:34:12       Um, so, uh, I've been really interested in this idea of a stimulation the outside of your brain after listening to a radio lab podcast called nine volt Nirvana. Is that the memory one? No, it's one that we're, they talking about skill acquisition.

Speaker 1:          00:34:28       Okay. Yeah, that's what I meant with the sharp shooter. Yes, yes, yes. This is too big to send to you. Oh, can we? This? If you send it through google will go to google drive and I wrote to him with the password. Thank you guys. Got muscly head

Speaker 4:          00:34:44       Yo. My fucking head. He things my head is power lifting. I remember when I was a kid, they did this cat scan on marvelous Marvin Hagler, Marvin Hagler, who was one of the greatest boxers of all time, had very large muscles around his temples, like extraordinarily large, like not just a little bit bigger than everybody else's, but like two or three times larger than the average person. Like essentially you get to see it

Speaker 1:          00:35:13       feigns. Yeah. He had like thick veins that I remember.

Speaker 4:          00:35:16       Yeah, he had headgear. He essentially had muscle head gear around his temples, like in the side of his head and they were like, what in the fuck? And they didn't know if this was something that was developed from years of biting down on a mouthpiece and there was a lot of guys that did a bunch of different exercises. Further jaw itself. Like I remember Gerry Cooney had a thing that he put in his mouth. It was like a, like a thick rubber cable that had like electrical tape wrapped around it and he would bite down on it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:48       You know what's funny about 15 weeks, his jaw is that shit doesn't make you fear the guy a little bit more. Like he'll use fucking tape bro. He don't give a fuck bro. Listen Bro. All right, let me show you guys.

Speaker 4:          00:36:02       They were actually lifting weights with their jaw, which makes sense. You could power lift with your jaw. Some guys chewed gum too. There was nothing they would do. They'd get like a stack of Bazooka bubble gum and it turns into cement after. Chew it for a couple minutes and they just take that shit. And, and um, which totally makes sense because if your jaw is loose and weak and if you look at guys with big jaws like a guy like

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       that's another thing, the ball on your jaw. Yeah, you're gonna fucking, you're not going to believe how strong, how like rough. And like I have a knot in my journal right now. It's just not a ton but enough to get by. Do what you've got. I mean, you know what I mean? Spots whenever I get a massage and then they work your head. I get so excited. I'm like, my head feels so good. Daughter was rubbing my head the other day. She's like, does this feel good? I said, actually that feels really good. And you immediately become an eight year old boy. What do you do? Feels? Yeah, it feels good.

Speaker 4:          00:37:14       It's an area like your feet, like it feels good to get your feet rubbed. It feels good to get your hands rub. You ever get your hands massage? Yeah. You would think that enhanced nothing. I'll feel good. Like you shake someone's hand and doesn't feel anything, but if someone like rubs your hand, they start pulling your fingers and make them pop and stuff and they massage your palms and the tips of your fingers and all the little connective muscles and all the tissue in between the fingers. It feels great. Yeah. I need to get a massage. I haven't gotten a massage forever. Really? You strike me as a guy that would get a massage three days. We used to get them all the time. It had been too busy. It's been a month at least. Yeah. Maybe more. Maybe two months. I just got them all the time, but I get them to one. I get. I get. I get a guy who does a lot of rolfing. He just uses a metal bar and reading

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       my muscle. My nose. Yeah. Well that's what Ralph. They go up apparently they go up your sinuses. No, I've never seen it, bro. They fuck with your brain, Bro. They massage your fucking brain brow from saying uh. Yeah. You can roughing. They're supposed to go all that shit. Whoa. Your sinuses? Yeah. Alright. Coming incoming, nervous. Um, yeah. So this, this tms thing, transcranial magnetic stimulation covered by blue cross. Yeah. Uh, so yeah, that's what, like it's, it's, it was really, really good. Like I, for a lot of my life I felt like I had a,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       I had like a, I had like a, a, a thing like a, it almost felt like a metal weight, like a bit of like five pound weight on my upper left forehead. My left. And then so I went to this. Whoa dude, that sound is like an Mri. Sounds. Yeah, that's what it is. It is, yes. It's basically the same exact magnet as an MRI, but it's just made your day. Yeah, they put it on your head. It's pretty simple. The first time they measure it, they have to get to like the exact spot. Here's, there's another video where my finger is pulsing that you'll enjoy. And what is it doing to you? Like, what's the benefit? Uh, it's basically magnetizing and electrifying a. it's waking up basically did a synopsis according to them. Really? Yeah. So it's, it's waking up dead synapses and waking up dead. Waking them up so they're dormant. Uh, that's what they say. You don't even look into it.

Speaker 5:          00:39:37       Good. Shoot me on. Yeah. What is it can I do? And this where I don't have kid man. So I'm like, yeah, I don't give a shit. Whatever, whatever it's going to cost me. I'm happy to do it. If you had kids you think you wouldn't do it? I think

Speaker 1:          00:39:50       kids, I'd be like, you know, sort of more, more cautious about it. Yeah, probably because I'm not like reckless, but I'm not. I'm not like A. I do recently. It's also vague anyway, the research. It's also like,

Speaker 5:          00:40:06       I think it does this. Most antidepressants they know. They think they know what's happening. They don't actually know. Yeah. That's a weird one. Yeah. When you think about how many people are prescribed these things and then there's not really a direct understanding of how it impacts each. Each person. Like they'll tell you, hey, we'll try this medication and if it doesn't work we'll try another one. Yeah. Does this one work will just cycle through it and now how do you know if it's working for you? Or if you're having a good time in your life and so you're feeling better because maybe you started a new relationship and a new job and it's going well and hey, it's just a. everything seems pretty good. I was on medications that made me nauseous for a year and a half before I was like, you know what? I literally thought I was nauseous because I was eating too many lifesavers and not even fucking kidding.

Speaker 5:          00:40:54       Literally. I was like, I gotta take it easy on these life savers because every night I throw up all the way to the laugh factory and then I realized like, you know, Neil, you're taking a pretty high dosage of Zoloft. You might want to just take it down a notch. That zoloft stuff is supposed to be really weird for your discerning of what matters and what doesn't matter. Like, like it's hard to. I've never done it so it's hard for me to describe it. But yeah, the people that I've talked to that have done it and said one of the issues that they had with it is nothing had the bad things didn't feel bad anymore. But the good things didn't feel good either. Well that's the, with a lot

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       of antidepressants is they, they raised the, the floor, uh, and they also lowered the ceiling so that it, it narrows your band of experience, basically a witch. But if you're severely depressed it can be very, like, like ketamine apparently is a lifesaver truly for. They may start administering it in a, in emergency rooms for suicide cases. Really? Yeah. Because it does, it's dry. I mean it's a, it's a hallucinogen. So you know, hallucinogens will make you like see things differently. So they're starting to, uh, there at least they're talking about administering it as a, as a, a sort of almost like a whatever that drug is that you can do almost like an Epi pen for, for, uh, for suicide or suicide thought thinkers, thinkers. Yeah. I'm about to do it. Yeah. Um, so yeah, so the, so the tms, transcranial magnetic stimulation, half an hour of that, of that debt, that debt, that debt, the debt doesn't feel like much.

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       Feels like a, like a Shitty Woodpecker, like a fucking sleepy woodpecker is sort of going at your head. But you're not like, Hey, get out of here where you're just kind of like, okay, how much longer? And you just sit there and watch TV. Um, and how many times are you supposed to do it? I, you do it 40 times four. Zero. Four zero times half an hour. And how deep are you in right now? I'm done. I finished it at 40. Yeah, I did all 40 in the fall. Wow. And uh, and I'm telling you it lasted and um, and you could go back for, for um, like sort of pick me ups every whenever you feel like you need it. Um, so I'm telling you this is the thing that has worked best for me better than ketamine if way but better than them. Zoloft. Better than I was on a.

Speaker 1:          00:43:25       what's an Ssri? Sarah? This strategic Sarah Selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Um, and uh, and went off at once. I did this magnet shit. So you know, you're off everything. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. And you feel great. Yeah. Just no joy. Well, no joy, but that's not what never had it. You didn't lose nothing. I just look at you kids have fun. I'll be over here. Yeah. But it's not. I'm not miserable and I'm not also, there's no physical manifestation. That's the biggest thing. The, the, the head thing, the feeling like there was a plate on my head. Getting rid of that was really, really, really great. So when you say like a plate on your head, like there was a pressure or. Yeah, I have a little weight, a little weight and a little pressure. Did you ever when I want that in there? No, because there were times where I'd go off of antidepressants and I have my jaw muscles and muscles in my temple would be so tight that I need to use like a massager well on them.

Speaker 1:          00:44:26       So I knew that there was all, it was all sort of connected. Um, you know, Ding on his. That was pretty sure that my thing, unless it's me, it might've been brown have been me bro. It was your thing fuck up there yet. Um, so. So that was a big one. That was really helpful. Then I did a, it was in New York for a couple months, did that show three mix, which I think I talked to the premise the you told me, but tell say it on. So the premise is onstage, I put three Mikes equidistant apart from each other. One is for stand up, one is for one liners that I just couldn't fit anywhere. And then one is for true sort of emotional confession, any type shit, talking about depression, talking about shit with my dad. I'm like the sort of the, I won't spoil the surprise but pretty heavy shit between me and my dad when he died or right before he died.

Speaker 1:          00:45:29       And then the, and then the second monologue is about um, kind of about like celebrity and, and, and dealing with, with the having a partner and then breaking up and become my own guy and all that shit. Um, so it's basically like it ends up being probably 40 minutes of stand up 45, stand up in a half hour of true stories and then five minutes of one liners. And did you do it after you had completed your treatment? I did, yes. I did it after. Yeah. And in the middle of it I actually stopped taking everything and it in the middle of recording or inactive in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the run. I had had an eight week run I think in New York and uh, and I stopped everything in the middle of it. It's not like suddenly just like, I don't think I need it. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       Yeah. Now, what were the, what's the difference when you get off medication? What was the difference in the way your brain was functioning? I can almost tell how well my brain's functioning if I'm not depressed or not slowed down by depression. My associations are much quicker. Like if you're just like the simplest thing of like, that guy looks like so and so like a sort of a little rose, like a little, like what is that shirt fucking looks like the kind of shirt. Like if I'm not depressed I can think of those quickly. Uh, if I'm depressed, there were times where I'd get depression would affect my memory. Right. I couldn't remember the, the, the, the test. I would always do my head is there's a guy who directed, gone with the wind and the wizard of Oz back to back. He's. Yeah, and I would try to remember his name.

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       His name is Victor Fleming, but if I was depressed I couldn't remember it. Like it affects your fucking a resource thing, like your brain is so concentrating on the depression and feeling like shit that just doesn't have the resources. I think it. I, I tend to think it's more a dead synapse thing and I think it's A. I think it's an energy. I think depression is a lack of energy in the brain, so in maybe you're right, maybe it is. It's all going to one place, but that's my own personal interpretation of it. Well that makes sense in that, in that way, in that definition that a aerobic exercise would benefit people that have depression because they say that this particularly running and a long form or will be exercise. It does something to stimulate brain growth and brain function. We also say like x, if you want to remember something, there was a thing last week or two we feel about memory where if you want to you should study then exercise and you'll, you'll have a better memory.

Speaker 1:          00:48:10       You'll, you'll remember this shit. You had your, you studied for me, there's nothing like physically writing something down with a pen. Yeah, I think there's something to that too, for sure. Like where you see it because it is like two senses. You're hearing it in your head. It's three. You're hearing them in your head, you're seeing with your eyes and you're actually physically forming the thoughts and I actually do say the words out to when I write something down like a slave, say it like write it down. You've got like and then like an illiterate person you'll be like. And then we were allowed to ride a bike and then I went to the va that no writing. You're trying to keep them from getting smart. Well I had the thought yesterday. Black people probably didn't wear eyeglasses until they didn't. They weren't, they couldn't.

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       There was no. Do you know what I mean? Like nobody intends to them. Certainly not bifocals. Yeah. They weren't being tested for vision. Yeah. It's. You think about it for a second and you can only. All you can do is do it loud. Exhale. Yeah. We've been talking about perspective recently a lot. It's come up a few times about how insane. Like yesterday we were talking about slavery. We're talking about the confederate war, the civil war rather than the confederate flag. And we were just talking about how insane it is that slavery was 18, 65. It was abolished. Like that is, that's, that's, uh, a week ago. Yeah. And you also think it ended immediately. It didn't fucking end immediately. No. It ended like, Hey, see you eight guys. We're going to try it. It's like at the club where they turned the lights on. There's still people that are stragglers.

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       There's people that don't want to leave. There was also then it just shifted over to sharecropping, which was like, yeah, it's subsistence farming. You can, you're still going to live here. A lot of people were sharecroppers. I read a book called, uh, some of my best friends are black. What seems ironic that I would read that book, but, but uh, it's about integration arrived because some of your best friends with black. Yeah, ironic. Uh, but it's about integration I should say, and it's written by a guy named tanner colby who's going to. It's insanely my name. I'm literally off the charts. Like if you were going to build a white name, it would be tanner colby and always wearing a golf shirt. Might as well be, uh, but he really went deep into integration. What was interesting was, uh, I highly recommend the book, but he said You, when you think about integration, your resistance, you go, yeah, white people didn't want it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:37       Black people didn't want it either, but they were like, we don't want to hang out with those motherfuckers. Like these black people didn't trust white people any more than white people. Trusted them. Like it was a mutual suspicion. At least black people had a case. White people had no case. Other than that, I think white people, a lot of racism is basically a white people fearing karmic retribution. I think when I think fear of black people is like, there is a Karma coming at me, like it's almost like too black and you think like if they, if they did something to me, I kind of have it coming historically. So let me just kinda like these. Even if you don't have it coming, they can make the argument and uh, and it's not a long argument and it's a good argument. Um, so, so that was interesting. And again, I think I've talked about and maybe I haven't talked about in here that one of the biggest proponents of integration and ending red line and you know about redlining, redlining was a thing where a banks would only give loans to people who lived a, they would circle lines on maps, they'd circle neighborhoods and go, if you live in that neighborhood, you can't get a loan. And guess who's neighborhoods? They circled back people. Uh, so, so black people couldn't move. And the biggest, the guy who ended it was Mitt Romney's dad. Well, how about.

Speaker 5:          00:51:58       Yeah, well, how about Baltimore or Baltimore? They had littoral areas of the town where they would not sell it. Black people. Yeah, they can't. You can't unlearn what do you have? Cash. You can't move. They literally can't

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       fucking move. You could buy within that neighborhood, but you just moved for the most part. Couldn't get loans no matter what you did

Speaker 5:          00:52:18       and isn't it ironic that in a lot of those neighborhoods the saving grace financially is white people gentrifying the neighborhoods and making them like super rich again? Yeah. My saving grace, that saving grace for people that were lucky enough to buy Roche has happened more. That's happening at a fairly good amount of, but in my neighborhood for the renters, it's pushed out so it's like, look, you wanted the neighborhood to be worth something again. Yeah, yeah, but we can't afford it. People are buying up these houses and redoing them and then selling them for shitloads of money will Benson Hurst, which was always like this horrible neighborhood. Bensonhurst is over. That's going through this wave of gentrification mountains going through like the entire burrows going through it except for the poor. The poor Italian neighborhoods are pretty much the same, but, but yeah, like the whole bed Stuy, bedstuy, Fort Greene, Bensonhurst, and those, those, those, those are the ones that we always associated with like dead deep.

Speaker 5:          00:53:21       The racism, the baseball bat racism spike the wife Beater Baseball Bat, real good. Italian racism. Real Italian sausage thick. Yeah. The fucking Ragu. The real stuff. Yeah. Uh, with men and goat. Do you ever do a stand up in those areas? I did stand up in, um, in Bensonhurst once, now. Yeah. There was a gig out there. God, I'm trying to remember where it was, but it was. I mean I might as well been a spike Lee movie. Yeah, I'm sure it. Did. They like you. I think at the time they did. Did you start to remember, use not like you play it up, but you did it feel like, well you could pass for Italian. Are you a metallic. Oh, there you go. That's why you passed. I'm, I've one quarter Irish, but most, most of it is Italian. Yeah. You seem Italian. Like you. Look, you look Italian.

Speaker 5:          00:54:12       I mean that in the nicest possible way, Joe. Well, when I went to Italy recently and I was like, oh, now I see what's going on. Those are some talking motherfuckers. Oh yeah, they talk up a storm. But what's interesting is my driver, uh, we, uh, we got a cab and the driver was fucking hilarious and not intentionally hilarious and that this guy could not stop staring at women. He would like hit the brakes to look at them better. Oh, look at. Oh, Jesus calling was invented by Italian dude. Basically their pigs. I mean this, I mean in the most beautiful way. Like it's kind of hilarious that this got me. He's, he knew he wasn't gonna get the fuck these women, but in his mind, like you had to slow down and head out the window. Hey, fucking era with the fucking thing. Hey, hey mama, hey.

Speaker 5:          00:55:01       But they so stair there staring at these women. There's this a framed poster that I have on my wall at home. It's an American girl in Italy and all the dudes are whistling in the background and they're grabbing their dicks and it's 1954 and I remember looking at that when I was a kid thinking, wow, this lady in this photo is probably like 100 years old now. Right? Or dead. More likely dead. But like these guys like this isn't. This isn't like something they learned from Washington Soprano's like, here it is. This is the photo. Oh No, I know. Absolutely. Grabbing his Dick and look at the old man who's got his arms inside the jacket. The jacket just thrown over. Shoulders guys. Sharing a, a nice guy. The guy in the school? No, not the finest broad we've ever seen either. Well, it's hard to tell because she's got this look on their face. Like, oh my God. Yeah, I guess I guess it's all relative. Yeah, but, but it's just that it's a girl by herself walking past this cafe and all these pigs. There is this weird thing in their harassment, uh, which is like a maternal respect to it. It's like you're beautiful. Like a my mama

Speaker 4:          00:56:23       that's like built into it,

Speaker 1:          00:56:26       whereas American harassment doesn't really have that. Whereas the Italian harassment, there's a certain little fucking little maternal like, Hey Mama, Mama, Mama. Because those guys, there was a big thing a few years ago on 60 minutes were Italian guys don't move out so it will be in their mid thirties and their moms don't want her to move out. They don't want to move out. They're like, I don't, I may not get married. No one can compare it to Mama. Just Italian guys in Italian. Guys in Italy. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:56:53       That's always been an issue with tying guys in the east coast too. That live in America. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:58       Yeah. Well they got it from, from, uh, from. Would you ever live in la?

Speaker 4:          00:57:02       I think. No. Go on. Fuck that. Blake. Go on. No, no. Well, first of all, I can't speak Italian and I don't have enough time. I mean, I just don't learn. You're not really interested. Second, if you liked the lifestyle though, I guess my question, I loved being there. I love it. I don't need to like live somewhere to experience it for a week or so. I think we're there for eight days is beautiful man. Like we went to the Mafia coast. Holy Shit. Is that pretty? Yeah, pretty. And I think the Vatican, the Vatican is a life changing experience. Go on Hook. Why do you say that? It's immense. Oh, it's hilarious. First of all, they have a 4,000 year old obelisk in the center of the town. Yeah. I mean you look at some of the artifacts and some of the stuff that they've collected there. There's so much shit there that it's just laying around stuff that would be under two, two inch thick glass and America. You could walk up and touch it.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       They're, they're like new shit would be our oldest shit. It's amazing. And it's amazing. Church in Rome. I was, I used to go there pretty often because I was dating a girl that lived there and, and a long distance relationship. It wasn't that serious joe. Um, but no, I remember she worked

Speaker 4:          00:58:14       dating in air quotes. Thrust your girl. I knew I knew a girl in the Oval Office

Speaker 1:          00:58:24       and uh, no, she just telling me that he had, I have a piece of Jesus's cross and it was like believable. Do you know what I mean? Like I don't even think they made a big deal out of it. Like there weren't a ton of signs about it. Like that would be like a, a huge attraction that would be like the number one attraction in, in, in certain states, in America.

Speaker 4:          00:58:43       Well there's a church in Ethiopia that is purported to contain the lost Ark of the covenant and they know, they know where the tree and they have the architect. This is what, it's weird. The people that guard this church, they all have like cataracts and shit. And it's, it's, it's a very strange thing. This is all from Graham Hancock's book where a, it's one of the first things that got him into this idea of like lost civilizations and that the idea that people had come up with like some pretty high level of sophistication in their societies. But then the societies would crumble either due to natural disasters or war whatever. And then they would have to sort of rebuild civilization, but he was investigating this one church in Ethiopia where the people that guard this church in Ethiopia, it's like a very specific sect and they won't allow anyone to get into the sacred secret areas of it.

Speaker 4:          00:59:46       And the speculation was that somewhere inside that church is the lost Ark of the covenant and that the reason why these people have cataracts and the reason why these people have all these issues like health issues, it could possibly be that what's in that last arc of the covenant is some sort of a, a toxic element, whether it's nuclear or whether it's chemical or whether it would stand to reason if you watch the raiders of the lost Ark that makes those guys' faces melt. Right? It sure does. I don't know what could be substantiated if anything, your face melt unless you close your eyes, you know, like one of those things or. Well, look, if someone came up with some sort of a nuclear reactor, you know, there was a kid that got arrested. I'm going to close my eyes if there's a nuclear blast.

Speaker 4:          01:00:33       And just hope for the best. That's a move. Like when bugs bunny would jump out of an airplane right before it hit the ground. Exactly right. But there was a kid that they found, um, I forget where he was, but he was building a nuclear reactor in his fucking backyard, I want to say he was 17 and someone found it somehow or another they found it. They're like, what the fuck are you doing? But if this kid can do that in 2016, the idea is if there was some sort of super highly advanced law civilization that had reached an incredible level of sophistication when it came to, you know, the ability to manipulate matter and possibly even come up with some sort of a reactor and that, that was what the Ark of the covenant was. That's why it was so sacred and fascinating because they realized they had an immense power, but that, that power was probably like some sort of a small reactor.

Speaker 4:          01:01:27       That would be cool. I hope when. That'd be cool. Be Crazy. It all ended up being true. Well then they know for sure that they've found batteries, they found batteries in Baghdad and uh, I believe in some of the ancient Egyptians sites that what it is is a very ancient sort of a method of creating a battery like that. That's 100 percent confirmed that I believe. Yeah. And that's confirmed. They know that they did come up with something and they, you know, they figured out a way to use that battery. There it is right there. That's the Baghdad battery. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. How old? That's old as fuck. I don't want to say, I want to say it's at least three or 4,000 years old. Find out how old that fucker is. How, let's guess I say it's 4,000 years old. Three. I'm going to go to to 2000. No, let's see. What does it say? No. Well they must be able to carbon date it. Nineteen 38. They found it in the 19 thirties. So to say how old it is. That's all I want to know. Speculation, speculation. Some believe that it was [inaudible] doesn't say age. 40 elements. Battery hypothesis,

Speaker 4:          01:02:52       nothing. Civic it, um, so, but see if you can find actually before he can find out, see if he could find the thing about the guys who guard the Ark of the Covenant in Ethiopia because apparently these, these monks, that guard, they all fucked up eyes. That was one of the things that Graham Hancock thought was like super disturbing when he started investigating it and was like, why is he got why these guys have all cataracts and shit. Like what? What's happening? And if somebody can come up with a battery, obviously there's a big step between a battery and some sort of a reactor, but if this kid in his fucking backyard is building a reactor, who knows, they had enough, a high level of sophisticated should whole. They had a high enough level of sophistication with the able to construct the pyramid. Right? Look at the Great Pyramid. It's an incredible piece of engineering. Two million, 300,000 stones all cut. So precisely. You can get a razor blade in between the rocks. I mean especially if you look in

Speaker 5:          01:03:51       tie up at the pyramid. Do you think you needed to be to get.

Speaker 4:          01:03:56       Do you know what I mean? [inaudible] like in like is there.

Speaker 5:          01:04:00       No, but I'm saying in terms of, you know, in terms of like what you do, what your position was. That's another pitch. I got an office on the eighth floor of the pyramid. The point I want to hear this, my office is up at the point. If you worked on the builders, probably didn't that probably. Although I don't know how, how what the. If if jobs were considered a big deal back, they used to think they were slaves. They don't think their slaves anymore. They stopped thinking they were slaves about a decade ago. I think when they. They uncovered some of the little camps that the people used to live in and buy the food that they were eating and by the quality of the clothes and the plates, they think they were skilled workers.

Speaker 4:          01:04:39       They don't think they were slaves in. Which makes sense because you're. You're talking about something that if you $2 million, 300,000 stones. I think the way they described it as if you cut and placed 10 stones a day, it would take you 664 years. So how long did they think it took? They weigh between two and 80 tons. They don't know. They don't know how long it took, but they know that it was constructed somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,500 BC based on carbon dating. So they don't even know who exactly which pharaoh built it like this. They get real weird with like what, what they go on in

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       terms of like, what's the evidence that someone made this or like one of them is this finks the way they, uh, decided to attribute the Sphinx to one guy where there's a passage that it says that he, it came to him in a dream that if he uncovered this, thinks that he would be the pharaoh. He would become the Pharaoh of Egypt if he uncovered it. And so the speculation by the people that are sort of back dating history is that the Sphinx could have entirely been covered in sand. It could be incredibly ancient because when Napoleon found it, it was covered in sand when, uh, when people found in the 18 hundreds is actually photographs of it before they had dug it out and excavate it. Actually

Speaker 2:          01:06:01       shooting the nose off. Is that a fake thing? Supposedly is true. Somebody fuck the nose up. Whether it was Napoleon or one of his crew. That's. I don't know if they know that for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:06:12       I know. They do know that the nose and the face are different from the original nose and face. The original face they think was an alliance.

Speaker 2:          01:06:21       Well, that's amazing. Like just people's love of faces. Like there's a human you've ever heard. I feel like I've talked about it weird that there was a, they, they put a monkey's. It's like, it's a, it's a defensive like star power and charisma. They put a monkeys in a lab. They gave them the option of unlimited cherry flavored juicy juice. Or they could watch video of the leader of their pack and they chose watching video of the leader of the pack. Wow. This thing in human beings like needing, needing kind of God's needing a, some sort of pillar or needing something to like it also, it speaks to this charisma, isn't it

Speaker 3:          01:07:08       possible? Also though that what they really needed is to get the fuck out of that cage and that the leader of their pack on a video maybe like, let them know your message. Maybe someone's going to let me out of here. I mean there's just pay attention. Maybe.

Speaker 2:          01:07:21       Yeah. But that's also something to like. There's something about certain people you just like watching, like there's a certain element of charisma, charm, whatever you want to say. Like certain people that you see them and you're like, okay, it's the definition of charisma is you want to say yes before, you know what the question is [inaudible] uh, and, and, and monkeys, monkeys got it. Joe, they got this, they got the effect on the Italian thing and got that thing. They got this thing. Well that, that sort of makes sense if you think about kings and pharaohs and the fact that, that there's always been this Alpha character. There's always been this one ruler for pretty much every

Speaker 3:          01:08:02       realization, every single city, every single state, every single country always has that one charismatic leader that stands in front of the people and lifts his hands up and everything.

Speaker 2:          01:08:13       That's the thing that people underestimate. I don't think we should talk about trump for a long time, but. But that's. He's got a lot of charisma. Say what you want to love the guy. He's got a ton of charisma and that's weird. Kind of charisma. Yeah. He's got like this mean guy charisma. You want him to like you. So you say things like you don't even believe. Yeah, because you want him to think that you're on his side so he won't come after you. Yeah. That's a bully charisma. That's absolutely right. But it's charisma nonetheless. That's the. And that's the thing about stars and movie stars and stuff like that. It's like you're watching this guy. You Watch Denzel Washington waiting for him to snap. He never does. But your weight, you can tell he's gonna. He just doesn't. It's like Robert Downey Jr. I feel like with robert downey jr, you're watching a guy not do cocaine.

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       Yeah. He wants to do everythIng in him, wants to do cocaine. So you're watching a guy not actively, not do cocaine from second to second. That's such a good analysis. Yeah. You just watching this guy, this thing, this car accident. That never happens. Yeah. You're watching a guy struggle slightly with. Yes. You're struck. You're wondering. I almost want you to see it on him. It's kinetic. He's just got a little bit and that little bit allows him to be like snaRky and weird and get away with that. He didn't get his medicine, but you could almost do that with, with a lot of dramatics. There's comedy stores less so, but there's something about tom cruise, that's that. Oh yeah, for sure. Right. Like you're just watching. I Don't know if he's. He's not going to snap. He's almost going to like fly away or something.

Speaker 2:          01:09:57       Well, he'll snap. If you talk about like psych psychiatric drugs like matt lauer, you're glip. Matt was amazing. Yeah, that was. That was a perfect example of why really big time movie stars should not have podcasts 100 percent. Right. You're absolutely right. But it's also a testament to his charisma that he said that and we're still like, eh, fuck it. I need to be a movie star more than I need him to agree with me about religion. Yeah. He bounced back. But what's really interesting is what he bounces back on, like is most successful is these wackadoo fucking science fiction movies. That's where he's done the best since that, the, uh, the, the day after tomorrow thing or whatever, that edge of tomorrow beginning. What is it? There's two of them. He did two of them. He did two. They did like one the mission impossible for the ones that, those. Or is that too? Yeah, that's true. But that's. Tomorrow movie was a good movie. Fucking very good. Yeah. Yeah. You don't was a really good movie and I don't know if deadpool, deadpool, I couldn't fucking believe how much I love deadpool. Sought on a, on an and he

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       kept cutting out and it was still excellent. Yes. Like, I'm not going to say it was perfect, but there were some there moment to moment. It was as good a movie as I can remember. Yeah. For a superhero movie is probably as good as it gets. Yeah, I totally agree. Yeah. That was a really good movie.

Speaker 1:          01:11:30       Yeah. It was very, very pleased with that movie because I had no expectations.

Speaker 5:          01:11:34       Yeah. And at the end he still gets to bang the girl, so there you go. The way they bang that banging montage was great. And then him putting up a picture of what's his name and his face Just like, oh, that's really fun. It's like where they let writers write well, like, yeah, just, that's a funny idea. So we'll just do that. Well, I saw ghostbusters, I didn't see it and I liked, which I feel awful about. There's some funny shit in ghostbusters. Like overall it's not a good movie. This is not a good movie. But they did some funny shit. They, they came up with some fun and I almost want to know like, man, what could this have been if you let whoever came up with all that. Funny shit just make, make a movie out of it where they scenes where they died. It was a dialogue, scenes and dialogue. There were scenes in. It was such a combination of things. That movie and it's so had the feeling of the hands of the producers and the executives. It's so handled that what

Speaker 1:          01:12:31       you you. In some ways. the thing I liked about deadpool was I was watching it going. The producers of this movie did a good job where they were like, this moment doesn't work. Make it work everYday. Like micromanage. Like I worked on chris rock's going to be top five a little bit for a couple of consulting for a couple of weeks and the producers is guy named scott rudin who's like a famous producer and what I couldn't believe was the level of detail that guy was worried about. It was He busted christmas balls for a year, but the script literally made them rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite and then onset. The guy was worried about shirts and buttons and that's what I realized like okay, these deadpool producers. Whereas it feels like maybe on ghostbusters that got, you got to get, you have to get lucky too with studio where they they, you all haven't agreed to set of of what's good and then you build them over

Speaker 5:          01:13:25       from. There was also this a problem that the movie had a very clear agenda to be a pro woman move, which gets means nothing wrong with being pro woman, but if that's.

Speaker 1:          01:13:39       It's like a. It's a goofy. It's not a theme for a movie. A comedy movie. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:13:44       All the men are buffoons. They're not just buffoons there. There cartoonishly retarded. Yeah. Like chris, whatever the fuck stands for. thor is so retarded. It doesn't even make sense. Yeah. He's, he's so fucking stupid. It doesn't make sense. But they keep them around because he's beautiful and it's like the joke. Well that's a funny, but I, I liked these revenge jokes where it's like, so you're just going to do what men did. How long is this gonna last? Like what's the next? It's easy a man to say like,

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       hey, do something else honey. But like, but it just feels like there's got to be like a next, uh, next. Uh, there's a lot of like rep retribution right now. Twitter is it blood just wasn't believable. A lot of what twitter is. Twitter is it, it's a lot of people. It's like digital lynch mobs of people that are rightly so. They'll go after people for saying something fucked up about race. Like they went up to juStin timberlake a few weeks ago because he said some of them were all the same and then it's like, but you can't say that and it just becomes this mob of people. And it's purely about racial revenge

Speaker 4:          01:14:47       as far as I'm concerned. well it's definitely about people having the opportunity to shit on

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       people that didn't have the opportunity to before and now they have it via. They, they have social cache and they have social power and they use it for the same bullshit of white people use it for. Well it's not even just black people doing it. It's a lot of white people, women, any, any, any, any sort of marginalized group, whether it's poor, any like literally any group.

Speaker 4:          01:15:15       this movie like this is, there's a bunch of problems with the moving, but this, the fact that all the men in the movie were ridiculous. All the men this mover buffoons all the men in the movie, like they, like bill murray gets fucking killed in it. Spoiler alert. I mean it, it's weird. It's weird. It's like it's an agenda driven movie more than they'd wrote something. They figured, well, it'll work if you do this or if it'll work if you do that. Like they didn't even have romantic interests in the movie because men were just so retarded. Like the women didn't have boyfriends. They didn't have husbands. It didn't have like they had chris hemsworth. Yeah. But that's it. And he was just eye candy. Well, the thing we

Speaker 1:          01:16:01       tell people is when you're writing about a specific gen, like for a long time, women in comedy, women in comedy movies were a props or they were like, andie macdowell always used to be like the love interest in, uh, and she was always just like this warm, sort of like vaguely disapproving. It's either like you're disapproving of the guy or you're approving to a fault because that's, if you're, if there's a movie about a certain, uh, gender, which was usually men, the women in their lives for the plot to advance. They didn't have to be for the plot or against the plot. Right? So then women started complaining like, will you see us as these binary goofy things? And obviously women in life are more complex than that. So, so now that women are starting to get their own movies and it's about groups of women, you see it's, it's a writing problem. It's, you're in a trap where the men and bridesmaids were goofy as fuck. It was an irish cop in milwaukee. Tell me more, because I've never seen that my whole life. A guy who's just like in bridesmaids is a fucking masterpiece for the most part.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       Just that part. I was kind of like, wait, so he's a cop and he's got an endless

Speaker 6:          01:17:14       uh,

Speaker 2:          01:17:16       appetite for wig even though she's not interested in was it? It was dicky to him, but he still, he'll take her back, whatever, and it becomes about. He's basicallY the only man in the movie and it's kind of a goofy part and it's once because it's about a group of women and that's just the purpose that men have in that plot, you know what I mean? But they, but they always say people take it as like this a sexism thing and I just take it as like a screenwriting thing. Well, it is that definitelY. But one of the problems that people have found when they're talking about this movie is that you can't criticize it because if you criticize that your sex. Yeah. And no, it's not. It's not a good piece of art. Yeah, there you go. It's not really well done. But who did, who did bridesmaids that I'm talking about the same guy who did it.

Speaker 2:          01:18:04       He's done whatever. He's done it twice now, but like I think he knows he's a really good writer. Like he knows you can use. It's hard to write because it's never been. I always tell people, listen, I go show me a good example of a, a movie about a group of guys where the woman isn't just even in deadpool, she's a prop to the in love with them unconditionally. Even though his face turns into a monster, she still wants him to eat her pussy and they make fun of it. Yeah. They make fun of it in a funny way. Like their meetup there, meet cute and then they think about like the damage they both are. That was like perfect to me because it was brief and it, it's like the thing they always complained about when you're developing movies, like I don't buy this couple and I can't fucking mouthing.

Speaker 2:          01:18:49       Sorry. I don't buy a lot of real couples. Well, not only that, they have to spell it all out in two hours. Yeah. And they have to meet and fall in love with him. Five minutes. Well, there's a lot more to a relationship in that. Yeah. Yeah. We can't show you all that other shit. Yeah. Because that takes hours, days and weeks and months and you fuck. That is correct. The sad thing about the movie, the ghostbusters movie is there's some stuff in it that was really clever. There was funny stuff and I, in the beginning I was enjoying it. I was like, you know what? I bet people are not given this thing a fair shake. And then as it got on and I was like, oh, they just. This is just so clunky. Yeah. There's parts of it that were just so clumsy and poorly because every single one of those women are fucking home run hitters. Yeah. Melissa mccarthY is fucking funny, man. The dude. She's fucking funny wig. Kristen wiig. Which one? She,

Speaker 6:          01:19:41       uh,

Speaker 2:          01:19:43       she was in bridesmaids. I don't, I don't know what. She's the auburn haired woman. Yeah. Leslie's a fucking monster. She's, she's handicapped in and they give her some clunky lines. Uh, and then, uh, the girl from snl, kate mckinnon is really, really. She was really funny in it. Yeah. She was very funny in it, but it's not that bad. I mean, I didn't it. I want to see what my kids.

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       They enjoyed it. But um, there was, there were some moments I laughed pretty hard. Great. But most of it not. yeah. Well, it's hard to make funny movies, man. At the end, they way they wrap it up, you're like, oh, christ, get the fuck out of here. It's like, it's so clumsy. Oh, that's just so awkward because nobody told me there were no stakes in the movie. It was just like, yeah, there's ghosts and we're going to fight him. Uh, we got them. Yeah. Yeah. It is weird. It's hot fucking mean. It's making a funny good movies. Really hard budget budget movie. A big budget with a legacy and a star in a, in a release date. Yeah. And if they just see if there was no ghostbusters before it, there'd never been a ghostbuster movie. And this was the first ever ghost buster movie.

Speaker 5:          01:20:57       There wouldn't, we wouldn't be talking about sponsors. It would be different. yeah. well it may be. People would enjoy it more and maybe they wouldn't be so handicapped because they had to sort of connect with the legacy and tie all these loose ends in and they could kind of do it anyway they want, but that's really a car. Whenever You try to redo an old movie, even if you do a great job like member jason statham redid the mechanic like, dude, I didn't know that was a remake of fucking charles bronson movie. You don't even know that. Oh my god. Charles bronson and that handsome fella from those seventies who went crazy a, god damn it. What is this? No, that was another one. What is his name? Charles bronson in the mechanic. What does the other. He was this really handsome actor who became like a crazy alcoholic.

Speaker 5:          01:21:52       He was really huge. And Michael Vincent, he would've been the next. He was really huge back then. Like he was beautiful frame right there. Look at that hair and this just tombstones in the banks and protestants all time favorites. It was korean. So, um, we called graphic right there. Jess. Perfect. And bY the way, no video. That's film. Ladies and gentlemen, that's, that's where kennewick, it's american. Back then when they, um, would do a movie like this too. I mean, like, you didn't get that many movies every week. It's not like today. Jan Michael Vincent played his, um, his protege and charles bronson was a hitman. You saw this in the theater tv. I think I saw it on television the first time. It was 1972. I don't think I've ever seen a charles bronson movie. So he revenge is right. Who the fuck are you? Is not a revenge movie necessarily. I mean, in some ways it kind of is, but really, which is a revenge movie, right? yes. Death wish was a, a, a white man's dream. The white man, his daughter, something, a bunch of, a bunch of dark skin. People don't remember exactly what the, what the premise behind it was. I don't know who that guy

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       is, but I like him. He's interesting.

Speaker 4:          01:23:07       Um, but charles bronson and jan, Michael Vincent, uh, they had this movie, you know, which was a classic movie at the time and then it was redone with jason statham and this other guy who is a really good actor who foster that same ben foster who was in that movie 30 days of night. Jefferson, that movIe.

Speaker 1:          01:23:29       No, I didn't see that. But he was molested a in. He was getting another movie with woody harrelson.

Speaker 4:          01:23:36       Yeah. About the, about Iraq. Yes. I know what you're talking about. I don't remember the name. He's great in everything. That fucking guy. He's, he such a good actor. There. He is all creepy looking. Um, so He played the jam. Michael vincent character, which is an interesting sort of twist on things. It wasn't a bad movie. It was a pretty good movie. I enjoyed it like as far as like a mindless action movie, but you're redoing a fucking charles bronson movie man. As soon as, as soon as you try to redo a charles bronson movie, do you have

Speaker 1:          01:24:08       any desire for remakes? I'm never like, oh, thank god the remake and it. Because I just would rather watch the original because it contains everything that I want, which is the actual movie and then the, the memories I have of it.

Speaker 4:          01:24:19       I liked when they remade the hulk because he kept doing it like over and over and over again. I'm like funny fucking guy trying to bit that never gonna work, but

Speaker 1:          01:24:30       did it with the eric bana. That was shit. That was the. That was the super emotional one, right? that was the only one that was like very emotional. Yes. I got to say I didn't really like the last avengers, the I should say the first vendors because it just seemed like, like they just spent the whole movie just like, hey, you guys want to, you got to come fight. And they'd be like, nah, I don't want to know. You got to come. All right. I'll come. And then they had a big fight at the end, but the hulk one was especially shitty.

Speaker 4:          01:24:56       I saw the avengers right after I saw x mokena, which was one of my all time favorite movies ex back and it was very good. Yeah. Incredible. I saw, I saw that one week and then I saw the avengers the next week and I was like, this is shit. This clunky. Yes, fucking movie. But, but homeboy played away better hawk. What's the fuck's his name? Mark refollow. Buffalo. And then add an orange to was in the original. No, he did the second one deal. He just doesn't want to fight. He's very strong, but he's not interested. No. Scientists. The scientists was doing an experiment and he was exposed to massive levels of gamma radiation and when he gets angry he don't want green. I want to know. I understand. I don't want. I'm not interested in that. yes, he's angry all the time. That's, that's mark rufallo secret. Oh, is that true? Sacred. Oh, got it. Yeah. So it was a rageaholic yeah, he just keeps it together and he's been at any moment he could just let it go and when he decides to let it go and he can't, can't

Speaker 1:          01:25:56       control it because why isn't it just one of these things like in the vendors it seemed like they were like, hey, come help us with this

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       specific guy. And He did tough to get them to pay attention, but that's the brothers, right? You can't, he can't guide it because it just seems like, hey, how calm. And he's like, but I don't. You guys are going to make me get angry. It seems like a small price to pay. Like yeah, fucking get a little bit angry guy. You're going to need you to save the world. Save the world. You fucking selfish fucking animal. Well, when they would go to find him the first time he's in Bangladesh, like boy, he was in the. Yeah, he was in like at a, at a like an remember that save the children type. Yeah. I feel like I've given money to support whatever the hulk is working, whatever. Dr. Bruce. And they'd come and get him with fucking rifles drawn and everything like that. Like to realize like you can't do that. like that violence is getting mad. and now read the dossier. Do you don't have anything but guns. What are you gonna stop them. Yeah, like don't move. I'm like, oh jesus, you got me. You know, you don't have. Don't move. Oh, don't move. Don't move. what if I fucking move?

Speaker 5:          01:27:08       What are they going to do? They're going to shoot him before he moves. They can do anything. You have bad news for the hulk. Wait until just the right moment to tell. So you and also your wife fucking somebody and then you fucking run up. Well, maybe that would be the way that you would get them to stop in the hall. Just give them ecstasy. oh, that's funny. Yeah. Yeah. Just, that's the new treatment for the hawk. Just keep them on. Very micro doses of ecstasy all day long. If he knew, I know a ketamine guy if you need. Um, I also am a little mad that

Speaker 1:          01:27:36       uh, lou ferrigno is not involved because he to me was the ultimate hoke with a rip george ripped jorts the ripped jeans shorts.

Speaker 5:          01:27:45       That is always going to be the problem with the hawk is how the fuck are those pants still on?

Speaker 1:          01:27:49       Yeah, it should be a dick flapping.

Speaker 5:          01:27:51       Oh, for sure. Mark. Look, I can'T even wear pants from someone who weighs 20 pounds less than me. Yeah. Just to add to the brown corduroys, that's how we used to do it back then. Joey brown fucking corteroids. Well, it was supposed to be purple. The hulk always had purple pants. Oh, that's interesting. For whatever reason, weird fucking seeds. Blue jeans. But if you go to the hulk, like the cartoon hawk, you'll see that he always had purple pants. Green and purple or a better man. The hulks pants. P a n, t. You've watched

Speaker 1:          01:28:26       pumping iron, right? Look at that. See always purple. Yeah. What the fuck is that? You have seen pumping. Are you see the new one generation iron? No. Good. It's on. It's on netflix. It's a banger. Really? It's a banger. It's also got one of my favorite moments in a documentary ever. Which if you want to bring it up, I and you don't laugh at this, then you then you're not yourself. This is like an alien test, like. No, this is joe rogan. I believe it's joe rogan. If you've laughed at this, well then now you're setting it up. It's a wasted moment. There's an I know. I it. It's that good. What's the funniest moment? I've ever seen the documentary. Really? Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       Are you going to spoiler? I'm not going. No, I'm not going to spoil it. Should we play it a? Yeah. If you bring it up on netflix, I will show you where it is. MighT not be able to do that. Fifty four minutes in time. ReCommend this clip a lot it. Don't you think the clip is probably on youtube? if it's says strong, maybe. What is it? Why don't you say a generation? Iron horse generation. Iron horse. Seen separate words. Interest. I stand by it. So is it a, just a new film? A new film. Alright, back it up. Back it up, back it up. Pause it. Pause it. Okay. Oh fuck you. You ain't gotta. Hear the guy. set it up. Go all the way to the back of the clip. I dOn't think it's long enough if you show. And if you show me another one, the guy talks about. You see what it is, guy riding a horse, right? If you go back, uh, to. And the thing is he talked about how he never gets injured. Oh, he's liteRally talking about die. Never get injured. People say, get injured. I wasn't even a real injury and now a pass. Two injuries I've had. Well, we're in the gym. They were outside the gym, so I haven't been hurt in the gym since 2003.

Speaker 7:          01:30:22       That's go.

Speaker 8:          01:30:30       Oh shit.

Speaker 2:          01:30:41       The horse just decided enough. Yeah, he was at the horse has had enough of him taLking about never being injured. The horse, he's talking about not getting injured and the horse throws him off the fucking horse. It's such fucking poetry to me and he lands hard. He lands hard and says, oh jesus. As he lands,

Speaker 2:          01:31:01       he's so big. You would think that guy is like, well, I guess he's kind of protected a little bit. All that muscle. You see that car accident sculpture? Yes. Yeah, that's right up your alley. Yeah. Well explain what you're talking about. There's a day. There was an art installation. Ate so many sculpture of what the human body would need to look like to withstand a car accident, to evolve in order to be able to withstand car accidents and know how the fuck they figured this out though. That's one of the weird things, so I was like, why their arms so skinny, like damn one inch or one image of it. There's some cars. There's nothing important in the arms to protect your brain and your heart. Is that what it is? Yeah. Why does it have nipples? Like what are all those nipples over the rib cage? Um, I think those are like panning. Maybe those are nipples, whatever it is. Those are like when you first get nipples, when you're of those, what are those things? Ridges.

Speaker 2:          01:32:05       Isn't it funny that what we look at today, when we see a person, we think it's normal, but it's just what we're used to is what happened. It's just what we are. I mean, people are fucking weird looking by the way. They didn't do any favors with the, with the facial hair and the haircut. Yeah. It's a weird goatee. LIke why I'm like, you look extra monkey ish. It looks very odd. It's really disgusting. He has a weird choice. And also the like the line to heaven down to his pecker hairline. Yeah. It's a weird, weird hair trail. Like what is going on there? It looks like a constellation space. Shit. Or like a tesla coil. Yeah. Radiating air. Yeah. It's uh, I don't, I guess. Do you have a tesla? You don't know? I do not. Oh, you made the observation or maybe it was you or bird maybe. Absolutely. What if there's a power outage?

Speaker 3:          01:33:00       Yeah. Well tHat's, there's that for sure. But all. I drove one for a day and I was shocked at how quick the battery went down. Oh really? Yeah, I drove, I drove from here to my house, to the improv, a to my house to here again. And it was more than half

Speaker 2:          01:33:17       dead. And how many miles was it? 100. That's not even 60. That's too bad.

Speaker 3:          01:33:24       Yeah. I mean maybe maybe 70, 80, maximum. Maximum 80. And it was more than half dead. so like when they say you can go 300 miles without a charge or what are they saying to 5,250 miles. That's under ideal conditions on the highway. Sixty five miles an hour. Drafting behind a fucking semi. It's not like stop and go traffic. It's not, it's not a, it's not speeding up, slowing down. It's not ligHts. That's. It's not ready. It's not ready. I think it's ready. I think it's, I mean depending on how far you need to go, that's half full. It's still pretty good. Well sure. You could use the average person only drives 35 miles a day. Yeah, I mean you could for sure you could use it as a daily driver if you could plug it in every night, but it's not ready for me to adopt.

Speaker 3:          01:34:14       it's just so limited that the fact that it takes so long to recharge like you can, you can charge in for a certain amount of time and I'll give you like 80 percent or the idea that maybe they could swap batteries. you pull into a place and they take your batteries out and give you new batteries. But then you've got to trust that they're connecting the batteries. Right. You've got to trust that the batteries are good. You've got to trust who, who had the batteries before anybody dropped muckrack. Um, are they going to like my fucking car on fire now? Because that was one of the issues that they were having with people in the chevy volt. I have not.

Speaker 2:          01:34:44       There's been. No, I get 300 miles a gallon.

Speaker 3:          01:34:48       That's a hybrid though, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, what the teslas, when they first came out, we're developing issues where the underbody would get hit by rocks and would start.

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       And then, uh, do you remember the fisker fiscal karma? Yeah. Do you know how that would killed that thing? No. What happened? Remember that big storm that hit the east coast? There was a big storm that hit the east coast. Sandy one. Yeah. I think that was a couple of years back. Um, destroyed a lot of houses in long island. that was hurricane sandy. They hit a port, the, the storm hit a port where these things were parked and apparently when they get up to the door height and water, they explode. Look at this. This is the, uh, see that sales, those fires going on over there. And the,

Speaker 1:          01:35:33       since the, that's the trigger of former. That's not the cars. That's the transformer. That's the transformer on the east village.

Speaker 4:          01:35:40       Is this a different video that says con ed explosion? No, you got the wrong. There's, but there's one that's like this. It's pretty similar to find the video of the hurricane sandy fires. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe they don't have a video of it. See if he can find it. Anyway, point being those things. When you get them wet, they blow up.

Speaker 1:          01:36:03       That's good. No, it's not great and people don't like that. So that company went under. Yeah, I have a volt. It's been great. That's a good move. Like a hybrid is a really good move. Yeah, because it's like gas and electricity and kind of run on both 40 electricity every charge and I can charge it in four hours for a full chart and pickups. Good drives. Good. I'm not like, I never really need. I'm like, the only time I'm using pickup is when I'm driving like a dickhead, bright, you know what I mean? So it's like you're trying not to drive like that, but if I'm cutting people off and doing shit like that, then you need the I need to pick up because I'm an asshole. right. uh, but for the most part I don't need pickup like day to day. You can only go so fast.

Speaker 1:          01:36:44       Well one of the cool things about a tesla is the idea of driverless driving that is fucking amazing. Name tesla at all for that. For the guy dying recently. The one that autopilot one, I think they've deterMined that autopiLot didn't have anything to do with that. He was watching Harry Potter. He was, yeah, it was proven. He was, it was still playing. It was like greg giraldo's joke about about rappers show him watching porn and they get into an accident and they're on the side of the road and the porn is still playing. Rappers watching, I think it was rappers want, it was, it was people having everyone on cribs had a monitors. Right. And their color suv. And he was talking about if you got into an accident and you're dying and it's still playing fucking dumb shit on your monitor is still playing porn. Yeah, I think it was born. There was a guy who got killed in Michigan. He was jerking off while I was driving. His car flipped is jerking off to this man.

Speaker 4:          01:37:40       Yeah. He can't wait. His car flipped and he died and he died with his pants down. His phone was still playing the porn when they pulled his life

Speaker 1:          01:37:49       body from the wreckage. That's a long clip, by the way. More than a dozen fisker karma. Hybrids. Caught fire and exploded. No video.

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       Just pictures. I guess. So we're wrong. So we have false memories. Yeah. God damn. That's what happened with trump on nine slash 11. Yes, he was. there wasn't. He didn't eat celebrators oh yeah, in New Jersey. So I'm all the way across the. Yeah. Well, some people musT have celebrated. So what? Uh, I don't think anybody was so. I mean, I don't think to, in jersey I'm sure people were like, yes, but I don't think people were going outside and fucking who knows, because then we'll get you popped maybe back then they didn't know. Well no. When. I mean that's a fucking chaotic moment to be able to predict what's gonna happen. Yeah. And how did it. Yeah, exactly. Who knows what was going on. Then they didn't know when that first happened. Yeah, I mean they could have been instead of celebrate and they could have been just going, wow, that's crazy

Speaker 1:          01:38:40       funny. As I think when I. I think I saw it happen, but I was in paris and I saw like someone said like, I am very sorry what happened to your country? And I was like, what are you talking about? Like the world trade center and I'm like, what? And then I ran to a monitor and saw psalm and butting my head. I saw it live, but I just didn't. Do you know what I mean? Like that's the faulty of faultiness memories, which is creepy that you can't. It's like you say ship with absolutely no certainty this point

Speaker 4:          01:39:10       memories are very bad. Yeah. I'm and I have some super clear memories that, that I can verify, but I've also got a lot of fuzzy ones and the problem is when people start attaching all sorts of emotions and all sorts of different things to memories and then they start distorting them and then repeating the distortion of the memory until that becomes the memory. And then in their mind, like there's people that have been involved in business deals and they think that they were so wrong. Then everything went so terrible and this piece of shit and then my wife left me. And then when you break it down to them, no, no, no, no, that didn't happen at all. This is what happened. Like they don't want to hear the results.

Speaker 1:          01:39:51       People I think that are a little bit crazy. I'm talking about you ever be arguing with your wife and you're like, I didn't say that. And then you think,

Speaker 4:          01:39:58       did I say like, especially if you're barely paying attention, that's the key longterm relationship case. Just got to be able to hit the fade button that they do. Is that you think that's helpful to round out and do you think she realizes it? What do you think? She knows that I don't know what you're talking about. Would you say? What were you saying? Yeah, you just fade out. But that's exactly the kind of conversations you start having. Like what? What'd you just say? What? I just lost everything. What did you say? Some will say so then we're going to light it on fire. What? Yeah. Okay. Now I have to pay attention. What are you going to light on fire? Who's going to light one on fire?

Speaker 1:          01:40:33       Yeah, but that's the thing about relationships. It's all kind of important, but none of it's that important in retrospect. Hindsight in the day. On the second of it

Speaker 4:          01:40:42       sometimes. Yeah. The most nonsensical thing could be so important. Neil brennan, so important. You have many daughters. Well, my situation is pretty comfortable and easy manage, but I have some friends that have some bad relationships with their wives and the. It's basically when they get togetheR it's just who's going to win today's wrestling match? How many, how many people do you know with, with marriages that you envy? Let's say you weren't married. That's a good question. Not manY because that's the thing. It's like not many. It's you know, most of them are. It looks especially from the outside, it looks like way too much work. Yeah, and it looks like disastrous happenings once it breaks off, which is different than a a boyfriend, girlfriend. If a guy and a girl, uh, dating and they just decided to call it off like, this isn't working. That's it.

Speaker 4:          01:41:34       Yeah. It's, there's very little cleanup. Yeah. That. Well that's it. Yeah. but if you are some man or some woman, even like a woman who makes a shitload of money and she has a husband's kind of a lay about and then that starting to happen, fuck yeah, it is. Fuck. That is. And then all of a sudden this dude wants a ton of alimony. Yeah. Like, yeah, like jesus christ and this woman who doesn't even like this guy anymore has to pay him 10 percent or 15 percent of her salary every week. And she's just like, I can't even Believe this. Like that is always been the case with men and women with a man having to pay the woman. It's always been alimony has been around forever, right? Child support, alimony. But now that it's in more and more cases becoming the woman playing the man, like talk to roseanne barr about how much he had to pay tom arnold.

Speaker 4:          01:42:26       And you're like, what? This is it's league. It's legalized stealing mixed in with prostitution. It's long, it's a long con. Prostitution in in many ways and it's involving the legal system and the banks and as soon as there's a system that's set up where people are profiting off that system, good luck buying it from their fucking hands. Yeah, and that's the political system that we have right now, but it's also the marriage system, like if you've talked to someone who's gone through horrific divorces and had to deal with the financial implications are or complications, it gets insane. Well, that's what buddy mine was like my wife. the sad thing is the deal she's going to get. I offered her two years ago, but she says dragging it out. They want to drag it out because it costs you money in legal fees. That's right. And it there.

Speaker 4:          01:43:17       You're still connected to them and they're punishing you. If you want to get the divorce, even if you don't want to divorce, there's a reason why they want to get divorced or they're mad at you for some shit. You fucking. My friend has to pay his ex wife for the rest of her life and he has a new wife and he has a family. He's got kids. She doesn't have a new husband though. No know if she has a new husband than the money that cuts off, so hE has to pay her hundreds of thousands of dollars every single year for the rest of her life. It's almost like he fucked her so hard. She can't work anymore. Like that's what the court says.

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       This guy. Well that's what it is. It's like how feeble were I guess. I guess it's societaly like women had it so much worse in the seventies when these laws were made, but it seems like there needs to be some kind of correction.

Speaker 3:          01:44:06       Can't have it so that if a guy is married to a woman, he has been not married to her more than he has been married to her. He was married to her for like 12 years. He's been divorced for like 14, but it doesn't matter. He stIll owes all that money. [inaudible] like because he, they broke up, he has to pay her because they went past 12 years being married or whatever the number was his two pair for the rest of her time on earth. Like he, he might not have any relationship to or he is responsible for her survival forever and not just survival but living really well. Like that's. I guess the question is how

Speaker 1:          01:44:49       important were the women who've got these laws passed? Meaning what do you think you're doing that is entitling you to this money, and this goes for men now too because it's like, well how good of a husband are you that you deserve half of her income for ever clearly your that good? Because she dIdn't work so there should be a penalty right there. There's not, I don't think they easily get half forever or whatever, but they get a giant chunk chunk and then a stipend.

Speaker 3:          01:45:18       Yeah, they get a monthly payment. It's just strange that someone could like people meet each other and then it doesn't work out anymore. They like each other. They spend time. Then they don't want to spend time and when they don't want to spend time to all of the sudden legally obligate them to send money like this is not. We're not talking about someone who by virtue of their relationship could no longer move her body, you know, like with a man and a woman gets together, the man has to pay because once a man starts fucking a woman, they eventually go paralyzed. It's just how it works. I mean, if that was the nature, yeah, that was the case. Well, yeah, you have to take responsibility for having sex because the man does something.

Speaker 1:          01:45:54       Well, by the way, guys would still claim like I didn't even. That wasn't even me, man, I fuck her harder. You think I'm the only what you think I could even fuck a woman in the book and into a vegetable.

Speaker 3:          01:46:06       It's, it's stealing, but it's also like you're cornering a person and forcing tHem to just get thrust into this weird legal system. So this weird legal system, it's pulling as this thing is spiraling down. The legal system is pulling money out of it. So there's this, there's this guy who's earning all this money, he works 12 hours every day is constantly hustling and doing deals and this and that, and he's putting it all together and while he's getting divorced, this woman, they're going through the court system and the court system and this two year fight is spinning this whole thing back and forth and you, you need to get more man because you have to consider his earning potential. Is gonna increase over the next few years and it wouldn't have happened if he wasn't your in around. I mean your stability in the relationship is part of the reason why he had the confidence to pursue these business deals and you should be compensated.

Speaker 1:          01:47:04       Well, that's what I wonder who were these wonderful people that this lawyer. No, I know, but who was the woman that they could hold up as well? You did this, therefore blahbity blah blah.

Speaker 3:          01:47:13       Is that. Well, first of all lawyers, a lot of them get a percentage. Yeah. So I think there's that. I think there is

Speaker 1:          01:47:20       so. And they make the laws.

Speaker 3:          01:47:21       Yeah. Well they definitely argue the law. If there's a strong Benefit to there being an extreme financial consequence for getting divorced, a strong benefit to the people that profit from taking people to divorce court. So and by the way that benefit doesn't exist like the other way, like if if your, if your lawyer saves you a fuck load of money, he doesn't get a percentage of what he saves you. Yeah, but if the lawyer on the other side, if they can figure out a way to get the court to rob you, but again you got to give your wife $50, million dollars or something like that. Like that lawyer gets a chunk of that. Like he gets paid if he successfully incentivized for the. A lot of roommates to attack the rich guy through attack the man or the rich woman. The sound bar situation.

Speaker 3:          01:48:11       But that's the way they get the money. They don't get the money if you don't get penalized. If you go into the case scott free and you know and go, I'm not paying that bitch shit. This relationship is over. And the jury says we agree mr. Mr. Brennan, you could walk and so you like, that's right bitch. all you're doing is going to pay your lawyers hourly rates and they have no. There's no financial benefit to getting this done quickly. The financial benefit is to drag this fucking thing on for two years and then let you know, hey, we got out of it, you know, and then you realize

Speaker 1:          01:48:44       a lot. It's like mandatory minimum sentencing. Exactly. Nothing they can really do unless you have a prenup or you can do a, a good, a litigator to a or like a whatever. The, the, the where they sort of a mediator I think you can get paid less than normal with the mediator.

Speaker 3:          01:49:05       This also here's another situation, like someone was talking to me about like the donald sterling type sugar daddy situation like and they were saying that it's awful that these men get preyed upon by these vicious women. I'm like, if you don't know that, that girl is fucking you because your rich. If you have a $100, billion dollars and you're 90 years old and this girl tells you she loves you and she's with you all the time, she's acting perfect. You don't know that she wants that money and by the way, if she's fucking you, she deserves a lot of money at least as much as you're going to at least half. If you're a donald sterling type character and you've got some tWenty five old super hot

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       stripper that you're laying pipe too, you got to pay her. I'll lot because what she's doing is first of all, very difficult to do. She's pretending to be attracted to you and you're disgusting and it's acting and basically surgery. It's the worst parts of acting and and and surgery. It's and it's super valuable to you. Like if you're that old rich guy and you have a 25 year old can get anything on earth except young girls, you gotta pay literally. You can get anything you want. Like lamborghinis costs less. They're more accessible to use it. That a, that a young girl that's actually tried to do a young girl that's actually trying to do, doesn't exists there. Unicorns. Yes. To leprechaun. Yes. Mythical creatures. They do not exist. Only in your imagination do exist if you keep her like constantly like covered in diamonds and furs and whatever the fuck she needs and crocodile skin purses and chinese named shoes and whatever the fuck you need.

Speaker 5:          01:50:52       Do you believe that is, if it is possible to be legitimately attracted to a donald sterling time? I think that I think there are women with big enough father issues that like, yeah, I'm legitimately attracted to him. Like I would be a 20 year old. I would never say that. Any like anything when it comes to attraction is impossible. Yes, exactly. Because there's chubby chasers, people that are into weird shit on people that are in a weird shit and there's a lot of women that find like older men hot. They liked the idea of like some white haired old dude laying dick num. Whoa. Who knows man? Yeah. Yeah. People like weird shit. People like furries. There's a lot of people that are really into being a furry. I also have no problem with, with, uh, with prostitution on its face. Like I don't have like, why do I care?

Speaker 5:          01:51:41       Why is it okay to get a massage? Not okay to get a hand job. RighT. Exactly. Stupid. Too good. Yeah. Well it's weird. We're regulating sex. Like were puritans. Yeah, it's, it's preposterous, but it's also, you have to think if it was legal, would it encourage or would it discourage the sex trade? Like in terms of like you have to worry about like sex slaves and some are, you know, that's, those are real issues and it's an issue that's completely unresolved because people on both sides of it claim their right and they both seem to have a good argument. And then also the argument is like, isn't it possible that there's a big fucking difference between a sex slave and a woman who like, maybe she's like a young girl living in New York city, the rents are really high. She decides to fuck some rich guys for money. Like why is that worse than working at denny's? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, why is it worse? I would go a step further, which is, let's say it is an emotional problem. She was molested. She wants to overbid, she has. She gets whatever. That's no different than the reason most people I know are showbiz

Speaker 1:          01:52:47       and I don't see anyone picketing that. That's true. It's based on an emotional stunt. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:52:53       And why is it sex? Why sex? The only thing that you can't take money for because jesus. that's really why. Because jesus. Come on, man. That's a weird thing. That sex is the only thing that you can't take money for ever. You can't take money for it. Yeah, but you can. You just got to be slick about it. If you can't yet they dress it up. well, like if a girl. Is it dinner? Yeah. if a girl's your a sugar baby. Yeah. It was a sugar based sugar. no sugar. It would be. They would pay sugar. Sugar baby is your baby. She was. That was sugar daddy. Yeah. Okay, so whatever the girl's name, whatever you would call her. If she's dating some super billionaire type richard branson type character, and he just gives her a salary, like what if he's, she's got a salary. It's like, look, baby, you get $5,000 a week to just go crazy with and give you a credit card. It's got $50,000 limit. Here's your fucking bentley. There's the keys. You're all set. woo. She's on the payroll. Is that a prostitute?

Speaker 1:          01:53:52       Uh, I don't. Roger ailes. The guy had fox news had that he did on staff. Yeah. And it was an open secret. How many of you have had one? but then he would just harass everybody else. Really? Uh, yeah, she was on staff for years. She was a researcher. Researcher. Yeah. Surely you must research. Maybe she must've done something worthwhile. Yeah, definitely. Um, at least something. Some of write up a memo or something that. Is that a business partner or is that thing of like this thing of sex? If you look at sex as this holy sacrament, than it is a. If you look at every ejaculation as the holy sacrament, Which the church would have you believe? And then they get into government, they make laws, whatever, uh, then then it's not legal, but if you look at it like a milking or even a teeth cleaning or a haircut or anything that you need, any service that you need fairly regularly, then it's, then all, all laws are like nonsense for the most part

Speaker 3:          01:54:55       is part of the problem too is the, uh, immediately accessible nature of the sex is troublesome to some people because if you have a relationship with someone who's basically fucking you for your money, like at least you have this relationship with them and you hang out with them for long, you have the time with them. There's a lot of time that's not having sex. So you actually have to be like friends with them. Yeah. And some sort of a way. But the sex for money thing, you just show up and you go, yeah, I'd like to pay for sex. And then you go and you have the sex and you're like, here's your money. Thanks. Bye. Like people have a problem with the brevity of it. Like bullies don't even entangled.

Speaker 1:          01:55:32       Yes. Sue transactional. It's not, it's a goes against god to their mind. It goes against god. It's like, that's not what god. God wants you to sit and be bored. Yeah. And go on a drive and help listen to them. They listen to your stupid stories. You listen to their stupid stories. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:55:52       Boy the fuck out of each other and comfort each other. Those are the rules. Yeah. That's how we do things. That's the fucking rules. You can't just be going in there all willy nilly getting paid money for sex.

Speaker 1:          01:56:03       Yeah, it's too. It's too. And, and I guess because sex can create life, you know, the other thing is the pill is pretty new man. That's true too. You know, abortion in the pillar, both pretty new and the laws haven't really caught up well. It's just

Speaker 3:          01:56:18       you shouldn't be able to tell people what they can or can't do with their body. That doesn't hurt anybody. Other than that. Yeah. Like you can't tell someone that they can play rugby. You can't say no, you can't play rugby because rugby, they run into each other and you're going to get hurt. What do you think's going to happen in the nfl? I don'T know enough about it, but what I do know is that there's a lot of people that have some serious fucking brain damage from playing football. Yeah, there's no doubt about it. I've met people that have played for it, um, that, that are pretty open about it. And I met like michael irvin. I don't know what issues he's suffered from it, but that guy is sharp as a tack. He's sharp as a tack. When you talked to

Speaker 1:          01:56:59       said it with cocaine, is that what it is? Balanced it out now? Super intelligent or all of them are very smart. It's, but it's, it's a late onset tHing for a lot of guys. Yeah, no, for sure. I was talking to a guy who who plays and he was saying like I said to them about he plays whatever, and I in him, he goes, yeah. He's like, it's not that hard. He goes on on, it's authentic. You have to remember more shit. He goes, but there are times on defense where I'll black out and not know what's going on. And you just keep playing, which just like jesus. Yeah. It's like, all right, so is the blackout from memory or from. It's from penn's impact sHe had. it's christ. Yeah. Cranial impact. And I, it sounds like that's all of them. He didn't say it like he said it. It completely like conversational [inaudible]. He didn't say it like

Speaker 3:          01:57:54       not a problem. Mr. Oh man. well I think they're used to so much trauma. Yeah. Well They used to running at each other full clip. We don't think of it as being the most violent sport because the thing of mma is being more violent because you're actually trying to hit the person. That's the goal is try to hurt them with your hands or your feet, but it's not nearly as powerful. Someone running into you, like someone running in us. that's a crazy amount of force into your head with that. I think that's where the league may be headed is no helmet. sometimes they go flying through the air, like you see guys get clipped and spin and they spin or they disguise gravitate. They like take you like somebody just knocked a 200 plus pound man through the air. Like a pillow? Yeah, like data. That's a car accident. Yet that guy just hit by a truck. He got hit

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       by a 300 pound truck every play. I think someone died. Not even beginning. When I watch, when you watch it, you go, oh, that guy's dead. He's definitely dead. I know I'd be dead if that happened to me, but it goes to that weird thing where they have powerful, more powerful fucking mandibles and weird muscles and like I think they build up a tolerance. I don't know about all that. I think after awhile they all just go down. What is this? Oh my god. Yeah. Jesus. Currently they're running at each other run. Here comes another guy. Lookout, boom, boom. Oh, that was just. That's nothing. That's what I was going. excellent. Play. Oh, that was good. But look, there's something dope about it, right? Like with this guy. Oh my god. He took a hard hit there and he kept going. It's completely elemental. It's the most basic instincts in the world is like running from a scary thing.

Speaker 2:          01:59:38       Yeah, there's fruit. There's that, there's that element of it that works. It's so primal that you're like, god, it's so exciting. It's, oh yeah, that guy got lambasted. Yeah. There's something about your running from someone who's trying to harm you as well. Like it's the most basic primal, the monster, the lion that whatever's coming to get you. And then there's the warfare element, like the ground warfare of like capturing the, the taking the, the hill or whatever. I get why it works. I think they just got to get rid of the helmets. It's amazingly difficult to move your body the way these guys are doing. Yeah. Did you watch the oj documentary? No. One of the, the big, big takeawaYs is how good oj was a football, because you forget I'm, I'm not old enough to remember playing football, so I heard he ran for 2000 yards, but they, one of the episodes, five, five parts.

Speaker 2:          02:00:40       One of the parts. It's basically just about that, about how nice he was. Football. Wow. And he did it in 14 games and, and like, he was like, it's crazy. Well, you know, one of his doctor said that if he had to rerun the trial today, he would bring up ct. Yeah. Which is, it's, that's weird thing to do Because then they would have to admit that he actually did it because the trial. Yeah. But can you let. Yeah. Then it would have to make a law about that. What's weird too, because we all know he's in jail for those murders. Yeah. Thanks. No, no. They found a loophole and they're like, yeah. Um, I don't see any reason souvenirs. He's in jail for really the fifth part. If you gotta watch it by the way, like I demand it. They demand it because it's, it recontextualized something that you think you know, everything about. Right. Uh, and it talks to mark, mark furman's justification for not being racist

Speaker 1:          02:01:39       is a, I'm not racist. when I was out on the street, if somebody wanted to go with me, I'd fight them straight up. And that's his reasoning. Like, so therefore is therefore I'm not racist. Were you just like, whew. But at the same time, you actually, I kinda like mark from it after watching the movie really kind of like, I like meaning it, I understood his, he makes sense to himself, you know what I mean? Like you see his lodging guard. I know why he thinks the way he thinks. Um, but uh, not like I'm a Fan of the guy, but you know what I mean? I hear you. I know what you're saying. Um, but uh, but yeah, like it's an amazing movie and say could you could, if, if they did say with cta then we've kind of lost the book. It's like temporary insanity,

Speaker 3:          02:02:26       right? Well, not really. You'd have to, you'd have to really quantify what kind of effects he t hat on him. Like you'd have to be able to figure it out. Like, is it responsible for you? Go on, man. I don't know. Should I take that from math thing? I'm thinking about doing this too. Or is it, is it completelY responsible? Like how much of the cte is responsible for your decision making?

Speaker 1:          02:02:49       Well, there are guys that save a blackout behaviorally

Speaker 3:          02:02:53       blackout and you have to believe him, you know, you have to think that there's, there's for sure are going to be some, some severe neurological implications of getting smashed in the head over and over again by the big gigantic dudes like that. You've got an cte for a bunch of concussions. Right? For sure.

Speaker 1:          02:03:12       What were the vomiting and grogginess and shit? Man, man,

Speaker 3:          02:03:16       I don't know. I, I do remember a sparring sessions, just sparring sessions where I got mY bell rang and I'd go home and lay in bed and then my fucking head would be throbbing and aching. Just ball ball. Yeah. I'm just sitting with every heartbeat and you think I'm. What am I doing with my parrain if that's what I was thinking. Yeah. I come to sun even any money in this? I'm like, I'm getting punched in the head all the time. Yeah. As I was doing a lot of sparring and wearing headgear? No. Oh god, no. Why gear? I couldn't see kicks coming. I didn't like headgear. Headgears weird. When you throw in kicks with other guys guys wearing them, a lot of ufc fighters were. A lot of people don't. I? I had a problem with them. I tried to were the ones that were the.

Speaker 3:          02:03:59       There's a bar that goes across your face to protect your nose. That's the worst. You can't see shit. I had to, for me, I had to go like the Mike Tyson style, which is one that Mike Tyson used to where where he, a lot of his face was exposed. A lot of people kind of criticized it because they said that he was more open to cuts and there's a reason why they had those big cheek, but you can't see left and right. Like peripherals, like if you're, if you're sparring a guy and he throws like real wide stuff on you especially kicks guys who sneak kicks around your shoulder. Like you literally don't see them until they're on your neck and it's not good. I didn't like it. I was like, I'd rather get hit with no head gear on. Well then you have a chance. Yeah. I feel

Speaker 4:          02:04:37       like I can move with it better. You can still, you're still in a bad spot, but the real Issue is cuts because a lot of guys get cut and sparring. You might collide heads, you might an elbow or something like that and when that does happen, the problem is then it could delay a fight and if you're an mma fighter and you're training for it, it's probably pretty smart to wear headgear, but it doesn't really protect your head that much. In fact, there's an argument that it acts as more of a fulcrum point because the headgear makes your head larger so you can like. Yeah, that's interesting. Wait and everything. It actually can make your head move more. well, it's funny what happens to your brain, which is, it just goes flying against your skull. There's nothing technical about it. It just goes like bullies.

Speaker 4:          02:05:21       Yeah. Yeah. And it can't maintain signal while that's going on. He can't maintain order and especially if you get hit in the base of your head, like one of the scariest kicks, the can get hit with it. A lot of guys get hit with his neck kicks, you get necked and uh, when you get neck kicked, guys go down like they got shot. Like a, there's a because it, because of what, what, what, what gets hurt? It just shut your brain off. Uh oh. It's like this thing. That's the shit. No, it's the shin slams basically against the base of your skull. It's like really? The back of the sheet is basically a switchblade. Yeah, it's under here. Google this ernesto hoost kaos. Maury smith. Maurice with smith is a good friend of mine and he's a former ufc heavyweight champion. Former world, more thaI fighter, more more time champion.

Speaker 4:          02:06:16       He's a bad motherfucker, but he fought this guy who's just one of the greatest of all time. Ernesto hoost. And he got caught with a kick to his neck and I knew how tough more. He says, I knew how good of a fighter he is. So when you see a guy who's at the level that maurice's watch this boat, see how he threw that over the top of his head and it just shut maurice off. Look at this. He slides on the outside and he lifts his head up, ellipses a foot up brother and goes over the shoulder or maurice doesn't even see it coming until it's already too late. It hits the back of his head. It's crazy and that's his foot, which hasn't even been hard. Well, it's still hard. It's ernesto hoost foot, but it could be way worse. You're right. If it was a little bit further back then it would have been over, but a lot of guys knock guys out dead coal that's in a punch to the back of the head and boxing.

Speaker 4:          02:07:09       Right. But you can kick guys and when you've landed, oftentimes lands in the back of the head. No one ever thinks is anything wrong with it. It's real weird. It's a super gray so you can't punch In mma. You cannot punch the back of the neck and head, but you can't. Exactly. That's very odd. It's so odd. Well, it's a. It's an issue with kickboxing as well because some of the best techniques land on the back of the head, like here's another one that does all the time too. We'll kicks like someone will throw, we'll kick like a spinning

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       heel kick and they'll catch a guy boom right on the back of the hat. It happens all the time and that's technically it's an illegal place to hit someone, but because head kicks are like, that's sort of like the ultimate striking weapon I give you knock someone out, like knocking someone out with a head kick because like the ultimate striking mountain because it's everything we always wanted to see in karate movies, you know, so because of that is so encouraged to like push the guy just because it's so encouraged. We don't think about the implications of kicking someone in the back of the head, which is probably way worse than punching someone in the back of the head. But it happenS all the time and kickboxing and all the time in mma. It's one of those weird things where nobody wants to talk about it and, but everybody knows that's the case.

Speaker 3:          02:08:22       You're kicking, you're kicking a guy on a totally illegal spot, but you're not trying how double the standard. They all know it. They all know it for sure. Everybody knows that, especially everybody's been hit by one of those are hinton's hit somebody with one of those. You know where you're hitting them. a lot of times you're hitting the back of the head. If you're aware of can you punch? If someone you can punch the all the back all over the body. You can punch the legs, you can punch the groin, but you can punch somebody in the ass. You can punch in the back, you can punch him in the back. You can't punch, punch above the elbow. Strike the spine. There's some weird rules there. Actually, we were talking about this yesterday. Jamie and I looked up there. Jamie said they came up with some new rules and one of them involves knees to the head to a downed opponent.

Speaker 3:          02:09:05       Now a downed opponent means you have to have both hands down on the mat and they're. Your palm has to be flat. You can't have just one. if you have one hand up, they can see you in the face, so that's not a downed opponent because there's a lot of people that were criticizing this down to potent thing because people were sort of what they would call gaming the system where you would lean down, you just touch your hand on the ground, like as if it's safe and then the guy can't hit you, so that's how you're. You're getting out of exchanging. Got it. Instead of you're totally capable of standing up or totally capable of covering up a. You can make your choice like you got to this position or he got you to this position. It's advantageous to feeLs like a fairly standard position.

Speaker 3:          02:09:47       Yeah, It happens all the time, but the issue becomes if you are incapable of getting out of the way, should you be able to nea guy in the head because some guys like when they're down like that, it's like, well that's a devastating maneuver to nea guy and ahead when they're in that position. So they for for good reason, they wanted to decide when it should be legal because there's other organizations. We could do crazy stuff like stomping people. You can stomp people like stomped their head in certain organization. So that was a big one in pride. You could soccer kick guys and stomp them, but oddly enough, they didn't allow elbows on the ground. That doesn't. They felt elbows on the ground were barbaric or something. They had a line. That's everybody's. People are so crazy with their lines. They draw. Can I pee

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       real quick? Fuck yeah. That's the part where I have to go to the bathroom. You drinking that delicious pellgrino I got into bubbly water lately. Jamie. I hate to admit it. I like, I like sparkling water now. I used to think there's no nutritional benefits. I had it in my head that like regular water was better for you.

Speaker 9:          02:10:51       Was that your thing? Yeah. Uh, the uh, keepers of the ark of the covenant. I found it. I looked up, I found something where it said that there was a report of one of them having milky cataracts and a description, but it's not all of them from what I'm reading.

Speaker 4:          02:11:06       Goddammit graham hancock christians in Ethiopia have long claim to have the ark of the covenant. A reporter investigated. Go down to the very last chapter or the very last paragraph rather. See what the fuck they said. Yeah. See, that's the thing about these things. The final moments of any search, I could not judge whether the ark of the covenant truly rested inside the nondescript chapel. Perhaps ma menelIk manilex traveling companions did take it and spirited home to Ethiopia. Perhaps its origins here. Stem from the tail spun by. So nothing. He's got no evidence.

Speaker 9:          02:11:46       Yeah, there's apparently also a storm and leaky roof that was going to make a move it in 2012. But I didn't find anything that said that, whether it was seen or not. And that, uh, the battery, the baghdad battery was supposedly also not a battery that think it was used for electroplating statues with gold and silver. Oh, that makes sense. There was a little bit of a charge in there, but not enough to be considered a battery thing. Yeah. Oh. So it was just a way they kind of made paint. Yeah, sorta started cover stuff, so I think they had a hypothesIs that it would spin it in there and it would create a bond

Speaker 4:          02:12:20       to the stone or whatever they were. That makes sense too. So that's the way they would use it on statues and stuff. That's fucking amazing. God damn it was so cool. When you think of how these people had to use a little monkey brains to invent the first wheel or did vent pottery, like the people that. I mean, when did theY figure out pottery? So if you had a guess, let's guess, what do you think? 5,000 bc. Four after a fire, not fire after fire. They just figured out what he get. Hardened stuff stuff. probably just accidentally. Let's google it. I say a 5,000 bc. No, because that doesn't make any sense because it's like qumran or not qumran. Samira samira was before that. $6,000. 4,000 potter's wheel though. Oh, oh, okay. This potter's wheel was invented in mesopotamia sometime in between 6,000 and 4,000. Does that say 4,000, 4,000 bc period. You guys going over ancient inventions? What's going on? We're trying to figure out when they invented pottery. oh, that has to

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       baghdad battery that we were looking at earlier. Apparently jamie found out that it might've been used to electroplate gold like that. It created a small charge, but really wasn't a battery. It was just used to make like almost like electric paint and then we're trying to figure out. Well, I was like, how fucking cool is that? Like how, how crazy were the first people, the first monkey people from like a million years ago at wherever I was, I figured out how to make a flint knife. You know the first people that figured out pottery if figured out how to roll dirt and light it on fire.

Speaker 9:          02:14:04       There's a duncan brought up as last appearance. Not as most recent one. There's a whole Youtube channel. have a guy that does this. He makes tons of different experiments and trying out primitive technologies and processes. He doesn't talk at all. I'm going to look it up so I can find out what it's called, but It just made a really cool one where he pulled little pieces of metal out of iron ore and he had to. He invented this way to get his flame hotter using some sort of thing. He and he shows you make he makes. The whole thing was really, really cool. Shit.

Speaker 3:          02:14:35       Just amazing. When You think of how long ago was it felt? Well, we don't even know what it was. It's someone first invented pottery. That potter's wheel was at least 6,000 or at least 4,000 bc.

Speaker 1:          02:14:46       There's also the idea that people invented it and it just never got out before that. You know what I mean? Two thousand years earlier. Maybe somebody invents it and then he just never. No one ever leaves that village. Hm. yeah. That, that definitely could be it.

Speaker 9:          02:15:00       So what does this gentleman doing? Primitive technologies that youtube channels. So it shows them make. He's making a forge blower.

Speaker 1:          02:15:07       What's funny is he has cave hands. Looks like the original.

Speaker 3:          02:15:12       This dude is one of, uh, there's a bunch of people now that are experts in ancient ways of living like ancient archery in ancient, like house building and shit.

Speaker 1:          02:15:25       It's really weird. Will there's something cool that I was going to say. Uh, you meditate at all. Yeah. Well, sort of in the tank. I do. Um, so I went on a, a seven day silent meditation retreat. Whoa. Yeah, no talking, no talking. Well, It ended up being like, we talked a for three minutes, starting day three, we'd talk for three minutes a day. Wow. But I got to say it was at, on the first day. I'm not kidding. I fucking cried. Oh my god. Dude. No talking. No television, no computer, no phone. Here's the worst part. No reading, no writing, just meditating and eating and whatever and being like, being in this village thing. Whoa. Um, but, uh, this video is fucking really cool.

Speaker 3:          02:16:23       This video is dope as fuck. This guy made these, uh, like made like a little furnace blower

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       out of this pottery thing with a wheel inside of it that he would spin and it would blow air with fire. And so yeah, it's like you got like a handmade fan and he does it by moving it around with his fingers and now he's making a rope and twine so he could pull it probably like, whoa. Yeah. And what he's been able to do with it as stoked as fire up in this incredible way. I mean it's just blazing and it's all from the wind that is blowing into it with this crazy invention. And this is some shit that people did thousands of years ago or something. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:17:08       they were quoted, watson, we problem solve all these things. He just keeps happening is first early videos. He makes us hut that's behind them and it's just out of nowhere. He was just in the middle of the forest and he goes and he makes his little bricks and he hates him up in a killing. He made and he started wIth no fire and yeah, he's built all this stuff. It's pretty

Speaker 4:          02:17:26       cool. Watch his wild though. He's doing all this clay and shit. There's a bunch. Is that. Don't eat that. What the fuck is he making, man? Getting the carbon and putting it in with the iron ore and he puts it in the, in the, in the, uh. Oh, that's right. He's going to make metal. Yeah. Yeah. This is insane. This is insane. If you make a call with you, megan. Yeah, he's gonna. Make metal. This is how people did it, man. It's what's, what's really crazy is someone had to figure out how to take all the elements that are involved with the cameras about fire. I know, right? This is, this is why it looks like fake fire. It does. It looks like some cgi fire. This is all cia bullshit. This is preparing us for the zombie apocalypse. They're teaching us when the grid goes down. How to make our own fire.

Speaker 1:          02:18:25       Uh, yeah. So silent meditation retreat. So wake up at a. So day one I cried, cried. Chris straight up. Cried. Wow. From like, it's, it feels like you're dead. You can't talk to anyone, you know. Whoa. And you can't get online, you can't read, you can't, you literally are like an apparition years walking around like a ghost. And, but day three and four were two of the best days of my life. Really? Yeah. Because all you're doing is meditating and meditation, uh, brings on, like to stimulate your brain, makes you happy. Like, proven like monks take mris and they just look like they, they don't stress, they have high, uh, incredibly low levels of cortisol and low, very high levels of, of, uh, of positive chemicals. Um, so you just, I would meditate nine hours a day

Speaker 1:          02:19:17       and. Yeah, and you just end up like. And the other thing I would do because I couldn't, uh, no one could talk and I didn't really need to talk to anybody. I would smile all day. So if you smile all day, it tricks your brain into thinking you're happy because your brain doesn't know. Like if your muscles are just, they go, I guess we're happy. So everybody act happy. Uh, it can work backward. The gun and paul ekman rid of book. Uh, but it was, yeah, it was an amazing experience. Amazing. I didn't know. What I realized is I came away with like, I'm so overstimulated at home with podcasts, television shows, computers, fucking phones, texting constantly that it's made me a really cut back on everything in a way that's very, very positive I think. Wow. Yeah. CAuse the dude I wake up, I don't, most people wake up and you immediately like mainline information or technology like, like I used to do when I smoke cigarettes, I'd wake up and have for cigarettes and drink coffee and just like shocked my body and I feel like it was awful and I feel like that's what I do now.

Speaker 1:          02:20:24       All right. What I used to do with technology, just like constantly turn my phone on to a tax, going New York times going this thing going, eh, I go on reddit going all these places. And it wasn't make, it was just stressing me out. Yeah. It doesn't make you feel good. Yeah. but that's hard in that weird thing that we all do. Constantly were acknowledged. Like it doesn't make me feel good.

Speaker 4:          02:20:46       Yeah. We need discipline. That's a big, big factor in managing the electronic world is discipline the discipline and I'll watch too much television. Yep. Discipline and not fuck around you. Phone two months. It did discipline. Did not play games too much [inaudible] you can, you can get lurched in the word lurched sure minutes. Yeah. It's not really the right word. It's probably not ultimately beneficial, right? I mean like certain amount of balance to it is really good, but it's so addicting.

Speaker 1:          02:21:19       We should have like one person, like a responsible guy. Like will you look up like The world should have that where it's like, hey, look up when, when so and so was invented. But for the most part we can just communicate because that's the thing. That's another one of those things where you talk about what, because I look up what actually makes people happy. Communication, a real connection. A community volunteering makes people happier. Uh, which I like in the big brothers program and it's like, man, it's not bad. Um, it hasn't given me a spike or anything. A spike of, of, of uh, adrenaline or a good feelings of like, not even adrenaline of like a serotonin, um, and, but really connecting with people. Is that maybe what you like about doing the show? Because I always find that I enjoy doing this show and people are like, it's so long. I'm like, yeah, I know it's long, but I don't know. There's something About just like sitting here and just like staring at each other and like, what else do you think? Do you think that? Here's what I think. Yeah, will. And there's something

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       about it for listeners. probably too. Yeah. Well it's so long form that you get. Everybody gets real relaxed and you get to. it becomes more of a, the way I listened to it like, a lot of guys do it this way, now I'm ari does it this way. A lot of guys do it. They'll just let just let it go. As long as it goes in. When you do that, like conversations, they evolve, they, they move around, they, they get deeper, they get lighter, they get silly. There's no, it's not organized. And I liked listening to people talk. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:22:58       Oh, you like ideas? Yeah. So you like to hear like, what's your idea that's not a good idea or that is a good idea. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:23:06       Uh, you got to be super flexible with your ideas. I've gotten way better at that since I started doing a podcast way better at trying to figure out like what is it about an idea that I disagree with and how much of it is that I had a different idea then that idea in my head, that preconceived notion, how much of that is how I'm affected by the disagreement or the called motivated reasoning. Yeah, that's, that's a perfect way of describing it. That's exactly what it is, right? That's super common man for all of us. And I think that having conversations on a podcast with a variety of different people that have a variety of different opinions, it's been really interesting because I get to challenge my own opinions like, well, where are my opinions coming from? They've been really vetted out yet. Or are they just some like convenience stuff that I've held held onto because. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:23:58       Well yeah, you have the shelving built, you have all this shit. You will have like, hey, I got the t shirt, I got the old thing, I've got the right adapter. Yeah, yeah. Uh, but yet, so it is this, this, that was what I learned. Like the, the walking around not having to talk to people. Yeah. Was cool in it. There was no pressure and it was also like the least sexual environment I've ever been on because everyone just looks like they have the flu. Basically. People are struggling. Did they have rules? Could people hook up? Uh, it was discouraged. It, I also would say like everyone, I didn't have a roommate, but like you're in like olympic style dorms, like were you have a roommate and it's like eight rooms and each floor it was like a summer camp basically where you did nothing.

Speaker 3:          02:24:47       It's seriously would be kind of hot though. It was having been there gal. Both sIngle. Both can't talk. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:24:56       Having been there though, it really runs counter to what you're going for. You're like, really? It's fucking interesting where you go, like you really see what's inside. Because I was trying to think of what it was like, like I was like, basketball camp was like, no basketball camp. We had tv, vcrs and talk the entire time. Uh, this was like nothing. It's like nothing you've ever done a you. And then we would talk and then they would do it talk every night, some theme, some buddhist theme, and then the next day you would, you would talk in a group about that. And what I found was I didn't even really want to talk. It's like, fuck it, I've come this far. Let me see how long I can. Not like, let me just see what a. But you see what's in there and you see like what your brain does.

Speaker 1:          02:25:42       You see what you're interested in. You see what you remember. Any recall? My recall was really good because your brain's. What I realized with the, with the all the technology is you. I would create chaos in my head, uh, with somebody voices and sounds and noises and did a that I couldn't even, I couldn't remember because it was like, I can't even get back there. I can get through all this garbage too, like the file that I'm looking for. So if I couldn't remember something I'd be like, just hang out. It'll come and it would always come. Um, but that was the, the thing of like, I don't listen to the radio when I'm in my car now, which is on, so just drive like a fucking old man. Whoa. Just literally just me and fucking me and silence. Just to limit the amount of signals. Yeah. And it's not easy, but yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:26:33       I got a buddy of mine lives in our law, um, Australia rather want to say Alaska summer. He lives in Australia and he takes these trips out into the bush where he goes out camping and he'll be gone for like eight, nine days or he won't see people for like nine days. And he said that when he comes back oftentimes it feels really weird to talk to people. I can almost like forgot how to talk to people where that has been nothing but him alone with his thoughts, with no cell phone service for like eight or nine days.

Speaker 1:          02:27:02       Yeah. it's really worthwhile because what I also realized is that I was like, with all the signal and all the, all the noise and everything is, is I was upsetting myself. Do you know what I mean? Like it'S like, nah, I don't need this much, and I would just overload myself. Like, no, this is, we're in the golden age of information and I can access any fucking video and look around the godfather and fucking scarface and all this shit. And it's like, no, you need to slow down man. Like that's not, that's kind of my temperament. But at the same time my, my nervous system was like screaming like you gotta chill out. Wow. Yeah. But I don't smoke weed or anything like that, so I don't have any way to, to separate. Yeah. Or to like to quiet my nervous system. I mean I've answered a stuff like that or. But, but meditation really helps and since I've been back I've meditated pretty much every day since, which is really for like three months, which is really. I've missed a few days, but it's definitely like an entrenched part of my life now that I miss if I don't do it.

Speaker 3:          02:28:09       Time for reflection is very important and to avoid getting stuck with momentum. Right when when you have the momentum of your life like and you just cannot let things keep playing out and just adjusting long. the fly that separation to step back and look at it so it's so critical, so important. It's so hard to do because I think once once things start going in your life, Whether its obligations or financial responsibilities or whatever things that you're working on that are occupying all of your time, they. They become so much a part of your thought process and you consIder them to be like a primary importance because this is like, I have to pay these bills. Hey this, I have to deal with this shit. I have to. This is what's going on that they. They sort of overwhelm cognitive reasoning. they overwhelm perspective. We don't have the opportunity to sit back and go, hey, you're not here for that long amount of time here.

Speaker 2:          02:29:08       Yeah, that's what it was like. Oh. So I died like, what was this like? It was a bit like the mark twain thing, like of like seeing your own funeral of like, oh wow. I was away for a week. I got, I had the automatic email thing and I knew so people knew I wasn't around, but I only got like 50 emails. It wasn't like an ungodly amount of emails. I got maybe 10 texts which all manageable, you know, like it's not like, oh I was, I was so missed, the world needs me. It's like, no, we can all duck out. Obama could duck out. Was in martha's vineyard right now. He's reachable, but he's not like working, working when he does that, like how much do you thInk he works while he's doing one of those? Those trips? like I'm going to bet three hours. Three hours. Yeah, I bet in the morning and then again in the afternoon. So it's just a random gift that's a completely uneducated. It's based on fucking nothing. I think people are gonna miss that guy so much. They're going to make it even so much. You can't even quantify how much they're going to miss him. He kept it together in the face of overwhelming criticism, which is really interesting. Like the way he handled it without a hint of bitterness or anger.

Speaker 3:          02:30:25       He's a fascinating guy in that way. He's a very, very measured guy.

Speaker 2:          02:30:30       Yeah. He's nothing if not measured like that's the. He's half everything.

Speaker 3:          02:30:34       Yeah, and I think the. One of the good things about having a guy like that, one of the most important thing is like you can criticize him, you could with them, you're not with them, but having a guy like that sets the tone for the way we think about ourselves and he was a nice guy. He's an arTiculate guy. he was warm and friendly. I believed him. Yeah. That's the tone. Whether or not he was really like that 24 slash seven, I don't fucking know, man.

Speaker 2:          02:31:01       It seems like he was,

Speaker 3:          02:31:02       but he's setting the tone with his behavior like, yeah, that's what what people are most terrified of by something like trump becoming president. They're worried that there's a lot of people that are like super aggressive and that like having like an insulting president

Speaker 1:          02:31:22       who. Yeah, I'm, I'm thinking about whether I agree with you about whether obama raised the discourse because it got courser and he got yelled at and you lie and all that stuff. He made peopLe worse in some ways toward him. Uh, how much can you talk radio and internet and talk radio got worse in the last eight years, which could just be natural. It have been worse without them. Yeah. Yeah. It's not a simple because it is like, it did get worse, but I think the thing that you said it's really worthwhile. It's like the level headedness event dude, and like a really measured kind hearted guy.

Speaker 3:          02:32:02       See, it's hard for me to discern how much of the hate he gets his from his policy from where the just the current state of the United States is in the eyes of ourselves, the world financially, resources, jobs, all that stuff. And then how much of that, how much of it is racism? Yeah. How much of it is, um, how much of it is legitimate criticism that makes sense? How much of it is, you know, this a criticism that he's always had that by trying to be accommodating to everybody, he really gets nothing done, you know? I don't know. I don'T understand it. Um, it's, it's, it's way too complicated for me to dive in.

Speaker 1:          02:32:42       The hatred thing that I point out always is, I think it's probably half 50 percent racism and february percent republicans fucking hate democrats. They fucking hate them. It's so. That's two presidents in a row that they've said we're not legitimate. It's so because they did the same thing with clinton where they tried to indict them pretty much from day one and investigate the fuck out of him and his wife. Well, do you rememBer that republicans versus I should say republican, uh, politicians because they can't say, you know, I can't speak for all people. Sorry. Donald Trump was a birther. Oh, right now I know he was the big. He was the big proponent of it. Yeah. He was saying he's kenyan. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's only down by three.

Speaker 3:          02:33:26       I mean, he kept saying it too. He kept going all in member. They released the birth certificate and everything. Like this is a forgery. Yeah, too. God damn forgery. Yeah. It all these reasons to believe it's a forgery. Yeah. He has people in Hawaii investigating. How hilarious is it though, that people would be worried if he wasn't born in the right spot?

Speaker 1:          02:33:47       Uh, well that speaks to people's, a suspicion. They want to believe that there's a manchurian candidate and it's really. There's a pod and there's a sale here. Neil brandon, as jesus is my witness, he hates America. And in the second amendment to peak a ball and it feels good to play the victim. Yeah. That's the thing people also forget is like, no, it feels fucking really good to go. Like he's out to get us. And he doesn't believe what I believe. It was like, no, he's fucking boring ass. He, I believe he may be an atheist, but I believe, but he's a boy. I think that's the worst thing you say about him religiously. Otherwise he's a piece christian at least. So the idea that if he's a muslim, he's an awful muslim and he knows another vacancy, what happens? Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 3:          02:34:36       So I bring garlic to the vampire house. That's right. I don't know man. I just, I don't think anybody's ever going to be able to do that job. I think that job is a ridiculous job and I think that at the very least he moved some social issues in a way. Like during his time I feel like people were more tolerant in a lot of ways. Like it, it, it opened up a lot of social issues that I don't think would have been addressed wIth a, a less measured, more easily accessible

Speaker 1:          02:35:09       truly is like progressive where it's like, yeah, like I'm a progressive politician so I want things to evolve. But then there's like the fucking ed snowden shit. Well that's the thing is he's super authoritarian and some with drones and snowed and shit like that leaks. They were worried about leaks than bush was.

Speaker 3:          02:35:26       Yeah. But here's the thing about drones, right? Was that happening anyway? Was that just going to happen anyway? And is, is it because he's an office, I mean, how much of effect does he have on what the heads of military decided to do and not do with things like drones? How much of an effect do you think, like personally he has on that? I feel like a lot.

Speaker 1:          02:35:50       did you watch the, the, the cia thing on a showtime? What? That was like the last seven heads of the cia. They documentary about the. No, it's fucking good. But it talks about. Yeah, it's like seven or eight. Michael hayden, bunch of them. These guys. Uh, and, and they talk about having leon panetta, they talk about having, having a guy insight on video live and having to decide whether it's go time.

Speaker 3:          02:36:23       Jesus christ. Oh, master's years. Wow. Yeah. Good. Huh?

Speaker 1:          02:36:31       Yeah. Really good. Crazy john. Super like, you know, right wing. It's like it's, it's, it is very pro death and pro pro fire, fire, fire our weapons. We got the weapons, let's use him type thing. But

Speaker 3:          02:36:46       it's interesting that everybody, pretty much that's involved at the highest level in, in military is. I mean, there's a giant percentage of them that are probably conservative. Right? Right, right. No, I

Speaker 1:          02:36:59       think so. I feel like it's 80 percent even though I'm making that up. Yeah. I would say I agree with your made up quote. Thank you. That's a good number. I would agree with that. I don't even think. Here's an interesting one. What percentage of merchandise do women buy in America? Percentage

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       of mert all merchandise in America. Forty percent. Eighty percent. Oh my god. Isn't that fucking insane? It's amazing. Yeah. Wow. Eighty percent oF merchandise is purchased by women. Oh wow. I don't even know what. I've known that for months now and I still don't know what to make. That's incredible. yeah. I juSt googled it said 85 percent can be as high as 85. They're window. Yeah. And they market, but the market, I guess they market to men to get the women to say, hey, buy this for me. I don't know what I'm [inaudible] men wouldn't have been by like video games. Deodorant. Yes. Shoes. Yeah. Shoes. jamie's really into shoes.

Speaker 2:          02:38:01       um, wow. That's a big number. that's a big fucking number. It was like, almost like it's trying to in some way replicate something that exists in the wild. This is the great joe rogan to go on. You know what I'm saying? I mean classic rogan numbers so strongly in the camp of women buying shit. Who, why? What is god saying? Yeah. It's got to come from the gas thing. They want to collect stuff. Yeah. It's like the same leftover echoing urge that made them pick wild apricots. Yeah. And we want to go and hunt. I bet percentage of men hunting is at least 80. Yeah. There's a lot of men. Um, I don't know what the number of women would be. Go ahead and they do it, but a lot of women do it in and they turned it into a career or how come?

Speaker 2:          02:38:58       Because if you can be like, I'm a personality, a hunting personality and you're a woman, that's like a legitimate career path. Like there's a bunch of decent looking and you can shoot for the bow. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And um, it also allows men and women to watch their hunt and shows together. I like when the girl when's. She's always right. Yeah. It says the same thing for motorsports says everyday agree that women racist bring fans out to the game. Seventy four percent of males in 62 percent of females agree that women racers bring fans out to the games. Hmm. Interesting. Well that's some underdog shit. I think it's the woman among the. I mean, I think it's like the girls who race in nascar, they go like, danica patrick is so hot and you're like, eh, she's all right. She was like, you know, we'll give her a six and a half, seven out of 10. That's hilarious. Um, yeah, like I can't say that she is like a, you know, uh, but, but it is definitely like more. It's the thing that you notice. Yeah, iT's super odd, right? It's super odd for a woman to want to do that.

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       But, but normal. I mean it's nothing. Nothing wrong with it. But for a woman to want to race like formula one or something like that.

Speaker 2:          02:40:22       Well there's a, there's, ooh, she's created looking. It's primary fo allow you say that the right way. she's misalign tropic. Oh see, these are all race car drIvers. these women. Jesus. Wow, that's gangster courtney. For us. It's good name. Hope that sounds so porn daily, but you have to be like a wild person to be a race car driver. Like a one new thing. It's a characterological thing. I wonder.

Speaker 4:          02:40:57       It's so risky and it's so rewarding, I would guess in a sense of like a sensory perception sentence. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:41:05       Well, yeah. You want to talk about upsetting your nervous system? Yeah. Yeah. And the consequences are terrible. if you fuck up, you know, car accidents at 150 miles an hour and not cute. Yeah. Instant. Horrific too. When you see people get spun around, they could fucking crashed and firing like that. Like The, it explodes like flex and you're like, was that a foot? I just saw dude, but having said that, high, high a rate of mortality, like the or I'm sorry, low rate of mortality. Like they actually survive way more than you think where you go, oh, that's another one that was like dead, dead. You're dead. Those people are dead and they're fine.

Speaker 4:          02:41:47       Yeah. Have you been seeing these people that put these balloons around their bodies and get hit by bowls? I haven't. We got to show you this. I'm looking forward to it very much. This is a recurring theme on this show. It's almost like one of those top 40 a morning radio zoo shows where they have those weekly gags on. One of our weekly gags is show one of the guests, the people with the balloons on that get hit by the bowls and this is my take on it. I don't think people realize how vulnerable they are. This is a. Oh, this is a different one. Oh, okay. Cool. This is a different one. And look, they got a rodeo clown and everything. They're trying to rope. Oh, this got the bull is going after it.

Speaker 2:          02:42:27       Guy get out of that suit on. Oh, he got flipped. Oh, he got jackson. Oh my god. This is even more horrific. So this was. This is obviously something went wrong because the bulls, they still seem pretty happy to be in there. They're not leaving. Oh my god. The guy was fun. I liked. It's interesting about. It's an interesting metaphor about bowls and a temper tantrum. They go after the guy, even though they're just mad that their balls are tied up, but they're like, well, fuck it. I'm in a bad mood anyway.

Speaker 4:          02:43:07       This is the better one. This is the one that we were talking about. This one looks like

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       it's first of all, definitely taking place in Mexico, right? Second of all these cushions these guys have, they're just not big enough. They only go from the waist up. Would you want to cover your dick? I think. Yeah, you're gonna. You're gonna carnage. Watch this because the bull gets loose and when the bowl gets loose, these fuckers in this thing, I think they just have this, this stupid plan that they're going to be fine. You've got to back it up a little because the guy who already got jacked. Yeah, but he got jacked before that. Right there. Boom. So they let the bull out the bowl sees these assholes walking around with these giant jelly fish. Fish balloons. I'll get a boom. I mean he goes flying, he gets gored on the ground. He gets run over. I mean this guy gets fucking jacked

Speaker 1:          02:44:04       and looking at the horses though, huh? No, the horses. Even the bowls know like, man, I don't want to fuck with that. Well they don't. I think they don't see. They don't recognize him as the is doing anything. People. Oh, they just don't like people. Right? I think. I think because of the ball stuff. Come on cow.

Speaker 3:          02:44:23       I think cows have always realized that people want to eat them. Look at that. Boom, boom. I mean if a cow sees a person, what are the odds that that's going to be a bad thing? The odds are pretty god damn strong.

Speaker 1:          02:44:37       Yeah. Nothing good's going to happen like, oh good.

Speaker 3:          02:44:40       They might squeeze your tests for a couple of years and then shoot you in the head for sure. One day they're going to shoot you in the head.

Speaker 1:          02:44:47       Do you think it's naturally ingrained though? I don't think [inaudible] is like an enemy then you can't pass that on june. Genetically I don't think. Do you know what a scrub bull as a. No. Tell me

Speaker 3:          02:44:59       scrubble or animals that until like the last, you know, x amount of years used to be domestic cattle, but then they get loose and they live in the countryside and this, this is something that happens often in Australia where they are not necessarily like the same strain anymore as like a strain of cattle that you would use for like beef or you know, like that you would bring to market. They have dIfferent, they have different genetics now because they've been wild for so long and they're not like an angus cow. So if you have angus cows and this thing shows up and starts fucking your, uh, your, uh, your cattle, you've got a problem, you get some weird cross breed of a cow that might not be like the best for eating right. But these things, they live wild in the bush, in Australia and in Australia there's no predators. They have like, you know, small things like dingoes and stuff like that, but they've never taken out a bull. There's the you would need a lIon or something like that to kill one of these things and they get cool looking like they look different. They don't look like a cow anymore. They start looking more and more primitive in some weird

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       way. They start looking more like like a animal that you would see in africa or something. It's really fascinating, man. Like here's some of the photos, like look at that. It looks like a long time ago. Yeah, that was a different animal, but if you just google scrub bull, is that what it is? Okay. Like that one in the upper left hand corner is a perfect example. Like that is not really. Obviously that's a cow, right? It's a bull, but that looks way different than the average bold that you see either at the rodeo. I'm looking at his balls back there. Right. I'm looking at john jay. That's up package son for them. Huge balls, giant antlers or horns rather, and his his face and just the way his body's buIlt. It's different. He's a wild animal and he's living the way they're supposed to be and that's why he looks like a wild animal and you know what else? He's fine. He's doing great. They're super aggressive though. There's some of the most dangerous things to run across if you're out in the bush as it were. I don't see what you mean. That's another one of the most dangerous things. What is that? That's a buffalo, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:47:18       Well, they rammed earth. Oh, yay. Is there been like a lot of animal chasing? You saw the tiger eats the lady last week in beijing. That was pretty wild, but a lot of like giraffes chasing cars and shit. Have you seen some of these videos now? Look, drab lookup. Draft chases, a chases. Listened. That only makes sense. Hauling ass by the way only makes sense. Yeah. They're tired of like, here you go. Oh, I've seen this. Yeah. That is crazy. The strides on this motherfucker. I know this shit in their pants. Look at it. Running behind them. You know if they would hit you with their head, we're right behind you. It's like you were saying about the equip thing.

Speaker 2:          02:48:09       Oh my god, this is terrifying. I think he comes around a corner again. I think he does. I don't know if this is the right one. Oh my god. What do you think it would do to those people? Just start smacking them with the tender. Yeah. Whip whip his neck at them. It's really dangerous. Like you got to think of how big his head is, man. Have you ever seen them fight so cool. Yeah. It's really painful. I mean like in, in terms of animal shit, like that's one of those things where you're like, I don't know guys. it is. What am I fighting? But that's like really fucking odd. It's one of the weirdest. It's one of the weirdest. and you want to talk about a concussion? Oh yeah. Like they must just be evolved or have really small brains are very tightly packed. Brian's

Speaker 4:          02:48:55       well, you know, sheep can slam into each other like super hard, but their brains are literally connected to their head different than ours are. They're like, they've evolved to absorb impact. Yeah. Rad would assume rams are too. Yeah, yeah, that's, that's insane. Those wild desert bighorn sheep, like, oh my god, this is crazy. Like what a strange trait to develop to have neck fighting. They're fighting like two snakes. Oh my god. I beat the fuck out of each other too.

Speaker 3:          02:49:31       See if you can find a, a good video of a big horn sheep head button

Speaker 4:          02:49:36       each other because these fucking things. They have these giant like battering rams that grow out of their heads and they like raise up and crash into each other and the sound sounds like a rifle going off. Yeah. And they do it in the mountains. Oh, these things, these fucking things. Living with jesus and decided to drink. Oh my god. Yeah. We don't have to listen to what that guy saying. He just talking about snow on the ground and the sheep are a going after it. It's crazy how hard they had head butt. Each other. Boom. Is that. what was the, the audio is from or was it from something else? it's weird audio, but they, uh, they evolve to do this. It's just such a strange trait. Look at this. Oh my god. Play that back hoe. Yeah, that's a rifle. They're getting rid of the fuck. I think troy, that's so weird. These things are straight out of star wars. They really are. Yeah. I mean, look at this fucking animal. Any kind of natural defense is always interesting. A shell or a horn. Yeah. Oh, there's, these things are dope as fuck man.

Speaker 3:          02:51:11       You know, they uh, have brought them back to a lot of environments now. They, they, they've transplanted them all throughout the west. It's kind of interesting. They did it. They brought them to a bunch of different states. They took like a viable males and females and they installed them in these areas and monitored their growth. Are they indigenous to, are they indigenous states? They used to be. Yes they are, but they used to be in More areas. They used to have a wider territory. But what happened was, I guess after world war or after the civil war, rather, there were a bunch of people that, uh, were market hunters and you know, the same type of people that shot all the buffalo for the hides and all that jazz. They did that with a lot of animals all throughout the entire west and they, you know, potentially wiped out or got close to having them wiped out like a bunch of different big game species like elk and deer and it took while to bring all those

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       things back. So what a lot of these, uh, conservation organizations are doing is taking these things and dropping them off into the mountain someplaces then monitoring them and making sure their population survive. But it's, it's, it's a fucking way to cool it vanana mall to not figure out how to bring it

Speaker 2:          02:52:23       back. She got to bring it back to. I've seen them in the wild. They are fucking cool. They're cool. And they seem Like they're nature's okay. Despite the headbutting. Oh no, they're just chilling. They just don't want that dude to fuck their girls. Yeah. Like tomorrow. So that we understand it. Yeah. As far as violence goes, it's like probably like the nicest violence to us. It would suck if they head butted us, but it doesn't seem to bother them. But I also would promise you that nfl players watch that and they're like, yeah, we get enough today. Yeah. Like before games and shIt, maybe have nfl players have to evolve to develop now a connection to their brain. Like a ram's. Yeah. They need to heart. I think it's gonna be awhile. It's going to take a few deCades. You hear the helicopter, by the way, still still going on.

Speaker 4:          02:53:10       TheRe was some sort of a gas leak a few miles away. Some shit went down. Still going down. Still going down. Um, yeah. I'm watching those things. Head butt. Each other make just makes you weirded out as to how the different ways that things evolve. But they're all kind of life. Like how strong the differences between an octopus that can get out of the hole, the size of a quarter squeezes whole body through and that thing that slammed his head into one of the other competing man's raises up on his back legs and come crashing for it. And if they don't even budge, man. Yeah, they collide with each other. It sounds like a gun went off and they just stare at each other. They're like such a cool animal. They have giant nuts. Huge that this is based on firsthand. Okay. Yeah. It was pointed out to being by this guy steve rinella.

Speaker 2:          02:54:03       It's amazing. The, you know, when you, you think I don't see a lot of dick's day to day. You see so many dicks like on animals and dogs. It's crazy. Yeah. And we are fine with animal dicks. It's true. But human dx, we are. We have laws about hm. But we are living in a, in a, in a playground of fucking animal cock.

Speaker 4:          02:54:24       Well, you know what I think, I think people are supposed to live. Um, I think like naturally like, well we're inclined to live. We're inclined to live in a place where you don't need to do anything as far as clothing. If you go back to like the people that are the indigenous people in the amazon that are chilling and drinking iowasca and going fishing and growing their own vegetables, they're basically naked, right? Yeah. Probably been like that forever. They're walking around barefoot when I think as soon as you put on clothes, as soon as you can manipulate your environment and live in a spot where you normally wouldn't be able to live, but you figure

Speaker 2:          02:54:59       say phoenix. Oh yeah. Perfect example. Perfect. My friend

Speaker 4:          02:55:04       mike goldberg lives out there and he likes it. He just goes from one air conditioned room, another air conditioner room workout in an air conditioned gym. Go home to an air conditioner in America are either way too, like how did you put up with this cold or how do you put up with this heat? I wonder if that could adversely affect your health if you're only breathing in air conditioned air. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:55:26       Time. Oh yeah, like mortality rates. Yeah. I wonder. Probably not though, because the old people go to Florida and they go to it. Yeah. They thrive. It seems to put a couple of years on them. Yeah. I think struggling with your environment. Yeah. Uh, yeah. People are less likely to have. I think I can fuck with heat. I could take phoenix way over. Like Minnesota.

Speaker 4:          02:55:50       Yeah. A lot of people feel that way. The like, um, the, the negative aspects of heat is you just have to turn the air conditioning. The negative aspects of that cold is like, nothing's happening. You might get shut down the fucking power michael out. You might have to light your couch on fire. Stay alive. Yes. Whereas I feel like I could withstand. Yeah, 130 degrees if I had water. Yeah. Like here, here's all the. You would have to have. You'd have to have two things happen at the same time. A pandemic epidemic as far as like a disease and power going out. you'd have to have those two things happen in the winter and you, the people that are supposed to turn the power back on, they're not going to go to work. There's just some kind of an evil flu. If you get near people and they Sneeze on you, you're going to be dead within 24 hours. Like that's all possible. That can happen. And if that does happen and the power grid stays down duRing the winter in someplace and they can't figure out how to get people to go out there and fix it. And

Speaker 1:          02:56:48       yeah, whereas what's the, you look up the stats on heat hot when the air conditioning doesn't work after it's $500. Fine.

Speaker 4:          02:56:58       Oh no, you're 100 percent right. But you can take your shirt off his shade. You can lay in the pool, sweat,

Speaker 1:          02:57:08       you sweat. It's a natural thing. There's negative known natural defenses against cold selling. Pussy. Jamie, you know, you sound like jamie. Sound like a no good. I went through a week with a no power in the middle of an ice storm and we survived it. You got, you can put on layers and get warm. You can, you can start a fire if you want to get cold. You can't get cold when it's 100. I've seen that argument. My buddy has an argument. It's a, it makes sense, but I don't, I don't mind super duper hotness though. I just don't mind it. Like I, my body likes it better. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:57:43       Well I think everybody's body is certainly different. I mean, you, you'd have to wonder, you know, if they believe that there's certain people that have diets that um, would better suit them because their ancestors came from certain parts of the world. Like that's the theory. I think that that kind of makes sense that people would have a different temperature requirements as well. You know, what makes them feel like it works? Yeah. I think it stands to reason. It's like I don't have good circulation. I just think that people in being able to manipulate the environment the way we can. We will. There's too many of us. We couldn't stay in all the good spots. We can't all just live in which I live in san diego. Yeah, exactly. In fact, people don't even really want to live in san diego and it's there now. Sandra was here.

Speaker 4:          02:58:27       Yeah. But san diego is amazing. No, I know that's. But they still are like, it's perfect climate and people are like, no. I would even say san diego's not warm enough for me. Really. I like la heat. Wow. Yeah. You know what? There's a lot of cool people in san diego. I've always enjoyed hanging out with people in san diego. I think it's a. It's an interesting combination between like military and like surfers. Yeah. They're not a very stressed out group. No. San diego. Paypal. I think it's a really good city, man. I think it's a really good city. I think san diego is like probably one of my favorite. Definitely one of my favorite cities in California and julia has the most ticklish audience is ticklish. That's what I say when the crowds like so good. You're like, oh, you guys are just ticklish.

Speaker 4:          02:59:09       That club is awesome. Yeah. The lawyer store. Yeah. I think I want to do that the next time I go back there. You, what? Do you do? Theater? Say? Yeah, I've been doing theaters there, but uh, I, I did a laughing skull in atlanta last week. Oh yeah, that's really good. It was so fun. Yeah. And it, it made me think like, you know, I got to do more little places as well. How'd you end up doing the laughing skull? because I wanted to do a small spot beCause I did the tabernacle there last time I was there. Yeah. And I want to fuck around and come up with some new stuff and I've got some stuff I'm working on and I just knew it'd be a real intimate, real, a real tight little crowd. something like 80 people. So. Cool. What'd you charge? 20 bucks?

Speaker 4:          02:59:51       No, nothing crazy. Yeah. But the um, but it wasn't like a $100 gold circles. It's comedy club prices. It's a comedy club. Comedy clubs are there are so important and a lot of people that like get to theaters and they get to that theater stage. They never want to give back to the comedy clubs. They always have this like weird adversarial relationship with club owners. But I'm always like, look, nobody's perfect here. But if it wasn't for these people that are willing to open a comedy club, crazy assholes, like you and me wouldn't have any place to work, we're not going to make our own club. Right? Like gods like that are awesome. like bob fisher was the ice house. like he's such a sweetheart of a guy that it it, like it doesn't just benefit you to do it because it's a good thing financially to help him and help that club, but it's, he's like, you need people like that, like this. The only way we ever get to work. Same with comedy and magic club. Oh my greatest. Yeah. He's the sweetest guy. He's one of the nicest people that's ever walked the face of this planet. Yeah. Great. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          03:01:00       man. Look all the shit jamie masada takes a lot of heat, but think about all the charitable stuff that jane dishonest. Absolutely. Jamie masada has done a lot of great stuff. He really has and he continues to work with a lot of underprivileged children and he does a lot of different kind of get to do comedy camp on saturday. He, yeah, he's a good dude. Jamie. Jamie's good dude. And we need all these folks, these folks and they need us and it's like it's. But there's something that happens when people I think definitely happens when you don't get the respect, you think that you deserve early on

Speaker 1:          03:01:36       comics club. Yeah. But that was the offers are pretty like, yeah, 1500, like really shitty sometimes and then they go like, well you haven't done anything. It's like the negotiation thing. It's hard to forget that shit. It is. And it does become this thing of like it forces you as a comic to go like, well, when I get the chance to fuck you, you're going to get fucked. Exactly the same way. You're fucking me now. And they do it too. And they fucked pretty much everyone

Speaker 3:          03:02:03       and the, the developed this connection in their head. The club owners that all the club owners are adversarial with each other. No. With you? Yeah. Like this is, these are all your advocacy. Yeah. This year, the comic, those, the club owners, they're trying to fuck you. They're all pieces of shit. Yeah. You should give you your fucking money. It should be happier there. Yeah. Opposite sides of the aisle. Yeah, absolutely. It's like the weirdest relationship. But if, if there was no comedy clubs, dude we do, we will be fucked. We're so lucky that those goddamn things exploded in the eighties. Yeah. Like when I think about like the lenny bruce days, when he first started out, he used to have to mc. He, they're like, yeah, you still have to go on, you do standup inbetween strippers or fucking or something along those lines. Like there was no comedy clubs like they, that's a really recent thing in terms of like the last hundred years.

Speaker 1:          03:02:56       Well I was explaining to a buddy of mine about the, how comedy has become so necessary and I think it's partially because of the news in that when the news started, every news division like lost money and, but you, in order to get a license you had to have a good news division. And then in the eighties they deregulated it. And then news became a profit center for networks and, and good journalism basically went out the window. So guys like John Stewart and guys like Michael Moore and guys like chris rock and guys that were like political and had tv shows became almost like the function of um, of news programs before this. And I was explaining to him, he was like, oh, okay. Because I was finding someone like how john came, how his rise to power and cole bear and all these people because there's no alternative.

Speaker 1:          03:03:53       You can't. And now the internet you can get at least lIke reddit or, or like there's a lot of shitty websites with quote unquote news on them. But, but for a long time you couldn't get, it was just, there was a vacuum of like, there's no big objective opinion or John Oliver on hbo where he'll do these deep dives into, cause no one else is going to do them because there's no money in them. Allegedly. They'd rather do some sensational, uh, like the dumbest thing that the most recent dumping trumps that, uh, and there's no, like there's a premium on, on objective truth or at least subject funnily subjective truth.

Speaker 3:          03:04:35       Joe rogan, your thoughts. This is a weird time. So weird time when it comes to, uh, trying to dis disassemble the way we've, we've got this bizarre system set up the way we've got it structured. like we're getting older, you know? and as we get older, we realized, well, we're just going to pass on this stupid system to the people that are coming next. Yeah. We haven't fixed anything. That's the

Speaker 1:          03:05:01       one of the things I almost don't even know how to fix the shit.

Speaker 3:          03:05:04       Oh yeah, it's looking real good question. But there's an entanglement problem like we were talking about earlier when we were talking about different ways that people are making money, like there's so much money to be made. Like we were talking about it in divorce courts, but think about how much money there is to be made in keeping this system of government exactly the same way it is right now. Yeah. There's so many jobs that are dependent upon it. Like even if we think that it's a ridiculous idea, we need to abolish the whole thing and start from scratch. What do we do with all those people that are working for it?

Speaker 1:          03:05:35       Well, the other thing I was thinking is there's people like the thing that I do like about the trump movement is people could just go and like know the system's broken and it doesn't work for it. Doesn't Work for people anymore because everybody is bought and paid for everybody in congress. Lobbying is, pays, literally lobbyists, right? Laws, so people and people don't like it and they don't know how to stop it. Right. So you've got people. I've got a system. People go, well, do you know anyone that you think would run for office? No. Do you know what I mean? And as much as it's like because it's a weird job into, I don't know anyone who's just like that ideologically driven and could navigate the way it is now. So as much as I'm like, well they're going to change. We're going to shake the system up to what?

Speaker 3:          03:06:19       but it's not just that stop and think about what it is. It's like to elect a leader for someone to campaign and tell you that they would make the best leader. Like all throughout history, the people that are proclaiming themselves to be the ones that you should follow are almost always the ones you should never fall. Exactly right. so when someone is proclaiming themselves to be capable of leading this land and I am going to be your king and I will take you to the highest heights.

Speaker 1:          03:06:49       Right. But I don't even think I needed to do that. Right. Well, the chance to do that, you'd have to kill the king. You have to be the. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:06:56       But this is essentially the same model, right? That they're doing when they're running for president, even though we know that that's not the kind of personality trait that you would want from a leader, you would want someone who's who's not in any way promoting of themselves.

Speaker 2:          03:07:13       Yeah. A selfless, selfless person who does this thing that's incredibly a self interested

Speaker 3:          03:07:20       and they would have to figure out how to have fairly monitor this. The society that we live in had a fairly well. When do you decide when you put people in jail, when do you do? Do we throw all the old rules out and completely look at them all with new facts and new ideas? Did we just. Is it like there's a lot of weird drug arguments where there's certain drugs that are illegal that are way more dangerous in certain drugs that are illegal and then you look at this money trail behind all that and you're like, okay, how can you guys still do this? Like how can you still do this? Like let's, we should make things legal that the scientists agree should be legal and then everything else is dangerous. we should figure out how to regulate it, but you can't decide like why? Why is everybody deciding based on like ancient information?

Speaker 2:          03:08:07       Right. It doesn't make any sense. Socratically elected government and. But the p again, it attracts the wrong kinds of people. It's a, it's like churchill or somebody said it's the, it's the, it's the best of all the bad systems. Oh yeah. For sure. Obama released a or exonerated a bunch of drug war victims today, which I thought it was fascinating thing is a few hundred. Yeah, I think like 300, something like that. Yeah. Which is what I hope he said don't like if you fuck up, you're fucking me. Basically the poets who knows what kind of damage is done for time. Guy can't vote, can't, can't get most jobs. right. Uh, yeah. It's like a very, very fucked up system. How does that work? Are you an ex felon? If the president you have to clean out of you're exonerated? I don't know. Does that make you, uh, ever pardoned?

Speaker 2:          03:09:07       She's been touched by magic. You've been touched by magic. The president has magic. He can tell the court that they have to let people out of jail. Yeah. How old is that wacky idea? That might be the wackiest of all the people. Like I'm going to. Yeah. You can decide that the gardendale killed people should get free. Yeah. Because you're the king. Hinkley went free the other day. See that? What? Yeah, what? He's out on the streets, man. He might be listening to us last week. John hinckley, the one who shot reagan. Yeah. Holy shit. They let him free. Yeah. They're trying to get obama killed after 35 years. Who was he trying to say? Wow. He was trying to impress jodie foster's right message. He was. It turns out you were barking up the wrong tree for and she don't like dudes. Hey bro, you don't know about that.

Speaker 2:          03:09:56       Um, the, she's out the right guy with the right deck to this spot with the right dick. Brought it back to back to the land of the heroes. I gotta get outta here. Joe. Let's get the fuck out of here. Dude. I did want to tell the people that I will be, uh, in chicago and, and uh, and madison, Wisconsin, the 18th and 19th. Go to [inaudible] dot com. Where is it? What do you do in chicago? I'm doing three myths. Three valiant theater. follow your theater. Chicago's got a lot of cool old theater. Yeah, it's cool. And I'm the madison. I'm doing The majestic and then I'm shooting three mics in los angeles. September ninth. Don't have a venue yet, but majestic theater in madison, Wisconsin or said that's a dope spot. Yeah. So you, um, you don't change shirts or anything? Do you know?

Speaker 2:          03:10:46       Same shirt, had wardrobe changes? Yeah, it'd be pretty great costume on. Um, so, uh, so yeah, so three mikes September 9th and la go to [inaudible] dot com and, or follow me on twitter, I'll update it and 18th in madison of august and 19th of August in chicago. I'd hopefully delved enough into that. A magnetic treatment for depression. Yeah, look it up if you're interested because it's really, really. It was very, it's nothing has been more helpful to me in my entire career of depression. Is it available to everybody? I mean it's tests thing. Yeah, you can look it up. Like I said, it's covered by blue cross, so it's a really impressive. Yeah, it's a hugely helpful and the numbers are really good. Uh, there's a new one also called like I want to call like feta burst or alpha burst cmt, but they're using the cmt shit for tons of, like you were saying about that radio lab, they're using it for tons of different brain areas and it's.

Speaker 2:          03:11:43       And it's really effective. So I, and I'd say that having experienced it firsthand, it's kind of crazy. We're juicing our brains up with electricity and firing them up. Who gets her? Yeah. Good. We're gonna have magneto helmets one day for sure. Right, like the x men dude to put that helmet on and all the magnets and he would float through the air. yeah, we're going to pull those fucking things. We just got to make it to the, to we're going to make it past or are failing bodies, but once we get there, I think one of these cranial helmets, if they had a cranial helmet that came up with that, how these electrodes just constantly was zapping your brain while you're walking around with it on. Yeah. See your life clear. Yes. Yes. You know your boy joe. Everybody knows that. You're a good man as well. Yeah. Thank you. Nice. I always enjoy our conversations too. Yeah. Fun. Yeah. Neil brandon, ladies. Gentlemen. I'll ride.
