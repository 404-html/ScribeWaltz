Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Johann hari. I got it right. You said it right. You are literally the first person to have the same. I was saint you fed that. I once waited for six hours with a broken arm in an emergency room because they were calling for Joanna Harry to come forward to anyone who gets my name better than that. It's just assumed that was you when you hear you heard Joanna. I could all but I was lying that light, right. We pig or be like Fox. I want to help me so they have to get my normal mind. I would have done what went down. What went down with your arm. I just, I fell and I tried to do nothing. No glamorous story too. I fell down a staircase. I wasn't even drunk. I wasn't even fucked on anything. I just fell down the stairs. It's right. It's Daniel wasn't even a victim of domestic violence, you know, like no, no. Uh, surrounding narrative that we made that an interesting story, sadly. So give me your, if you had like a one paragraph take on depression, sure. What is your take on depression?

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       So this is why I wrote this book, lost connections and covering the real causes of depression and anxiety and the real solutions. So I wanted to understand why does depression and anxiety, what is depression? Anxiety seems to be rising so much. It's very personal to me. When I was a teenager, I had gone to my doctor. I had explained that I was in this deep sense of pain. And all my doctor did was telling me a biological story just said, basically your brain's broken. And all he did was give me drugs, right? And drugs play a role in treating people. But I was still depressed all that time. I was taking these drugs, right? Most of the time. And after 13 years ago, I thought, right, I need to understand what's really going on here. So I ended up going on this big, long journey, over 40,000 miles interviewing the leading experts in the world, and what causes depression and anxiety and what solves them.

Speaker 2:          00:01:36       And what I discovered is the, we've, we've told ridiculously simplistic story to people about what depression is and how to solve it. That until I was a teenager. Um, and I went to my doctor, I thought depression was all in my head, meaning, you know, you just been week, he'd be in a Percy basically and then the next day, 10 years, I thought it was all in my head. Meaning you know, it's a chemical imbalance in your brain. What I discovered is a, the overwhelming evidence from the World Health Organization, leading medical body in the world and loads of other places is there are real biological factors that can make you more sensitive to this stuff. But the causes of depression, anxiety are overwhelming in the way we're living there with these nine causes, depression, anxiety for which I could find scientific evidence, seven of which in the way we're living and some of which are rising, which explains this kind of epidemic and that opens up a whole different way of finding solutions.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       Now when you are young and you were experiencing depression, how would you categorize it? Like what, how would you describe it if you had to describe it to someone who didn't understand depression? Yeah. Try try to keep this amount of fist away from sharks.

Speaker 2:          00:02:37       I think I'll move a bit closer to me. Yeah. I think depression, depression is despair spreading. Everyone has moments of hopelessness in their lives, right? Right. It's that spreading further, but I think one of the things I learned is a deeper way of thinking about this, which is everyone listening to this, everyone watching this knows

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       they have natural physical needs, right? You need food. You need water. You need clean air. You need

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       warmth. If I took those things away from you, you would be a real trouble real fast. Right? Right. This is equally strong evidence that human beings have natural psychological needs, right? You've got to feel you belong. You've got to fill. Your life has meaning and purpose. You've got to feel that people see you and value you. You've got to feel that you've got autonomy. You've got to feel that you've got a future that makes sense, and our culture is good at lots of things. I'm glad to be alive today, but our culture has been getting less and less good at meeting these deep, underlying psychological needs for lots of people. And that is the key reason. So only one, but it's the key reason why we have this rising depression, anxiety epidemic. That can sound a bit weird in the abstracts. I can give you some specific examples if you want.

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       Okay, sure. So I'll give you one example. I noticed that lots of the people I know who are depressed and anxious that depression and anxiety focuses around their work, right? Start to think what's going on here. So I started to look for evidence about how people feel about their work. Best Research on this was done by Gallup, the opinion poll company, massive detailed study to a couple of years. They found the figures for how people feel about working in the u s and other comparable countries. What they found is 13% of us, one 3% basically like our work, most of the time we get energy from it. 63% of us or what they called sleep working. So they like their work. Don't hate their work, they're just kind of enduring it. And 24% of people fucking hate their work, right? Fear and dread it. So I was quite struck by that when I looked at it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:22       That means 87% of people don't like the thing they're doing most of the time. That's incredible. It's so striking. And bear in mind, this thing that we don't like is spread over even more of our lives. Right? Average person answers their first email at 7:48 AM and leaves work at 7:15 PM so this is most of our waking lives. We're doing something we don't like. I started to think, could there be some connection between that and this epidemic of awful sort of forms of despair, anxiety, depression, addiction. So I start to look for, scientists had studied this. I discovered an amazing Australian social scientist called Professor Michael Marmot, who I got to know who discovered the key to what causes depression at work, right? There's several aspects of this. I can tell you the story, how he discovered it. If you want to think it's an amazing story, but the core of it is if you go to work and you are controlled, so you feel you have low or no control, you are radically more likely to become depressed.

Speaker 2:          00:05:18       You're even more likely to have a stress related heart attack. And I think the reason is clear then going a bit further than professor moment does. Um, human beings need to feel our lives have meaning. Right? And if you're controlled all the time, you don't feel like your life has meaning. You don't feel like you, it disrupts your ability to create meaning out of your work and it makes you feel like shit. Right. That makes sense. And one of the things, so one thing that was really important to me in everything I was learning in the research for loss connections was there was this, it required this kind of shift in my mind because what I was basically told by my doctor is, your pain is a malfunction, right? He said, you know, we know what causes depression. It's just some people naturally have low levels of Serotonin in their brains.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       Um, you know, you're clearly one of them that that's what's going on here. And one thing that was really striking, speaking to the leading experts in the world is that story is just not true. There are real biological factors. There are real things that happen in your brain, obviously. But actually a professor Andrew Skull at Princeton University says it's deeply misleading and unscientific to say depression is just caused by low Serotonin, right? This is just not true. Um, but, but one thing that was so important to me looking at these nine real causes of depression and anxiety was realizing actually our pain makes sense, right? If you're depressed, if you're anxious, you've been told basically that you're a bit crazy. There's something not working, but actually you're not a machine with broken parts, right? You're a human being with unmet needs and that requires a very different set of responses.

Speaker 2:          00:06:45       So you think about, I start to think, well, let's think about that problem with work, right? Most people feel they've got no control at work or low control, and it's making them feel terrible. They're not wrong to feel that, right? They've got a need as human beings and it's not being met. How can we deal with this? And I learned there's a really interesting strategy to deal with this. Now. This is something some people will be able to do as individuals, but it's something we can actually change as a society so far more people could do it. I went to Baltimore and I interviewed a woman. Could Meredith Kio young woman, meredith used to go to bed every Sunday night just fucking sick with anxiety. Right? She would, she would, she had an office job. It wasn't the worst office job in the world. Right? She wasn't being bullied, she wasn't being harassed, but she just, she just felt like she just couldn't bear the thought of the next 40 years of her life.

Speaker 2:          00:07:28       We're going to be this right. And one day with her husband, Josh, she is quite bold thing. Josh was a working class guy from Baltimore since he was a teenager. He that he'd, um, worked in bike stores and you know, working at a bike store, your viewers will know it's insecure work. It's controlled. You do it boss tells you that you can get vacations and less the boss, you know, it's nice to, yeah, and Josh and his colleagues in the store, they didn't hate their boss. He wasn't a particularly bad boss as far as policies go. They quite liked him as a person. But one day they just asked, what does that boss actually do? Right? We fixed all the bikes and he seems to make all the money was what's going on here. They decided to do an experiment. They, they, they, they sit up at a different bike store, arrival, bike store.

Speaker 2:          00:08:11       It's called Baltimore Bicycle Works and it works on a different principle. So most people listening to this will work in corporations. Right? Top down, you do what the boss says. It's modeled like an army that is a very recent human invention rights and comes along in the late 19th century. What they did was try different model. They called democratic cooperatives. So at Baltimore Bicycle Works, they take all the big decisions together about their work. They vote, uh, they share out the good tasks in the shitty tasks. I know I can just get stuck with all the shitty tasks. They share the profits obviously. So they control their environment together. They're like a little tribe that control their environment instead of an army with one guy at the top controlling it. And one thing that was so fascinating spending time with them, she's totally in finding a professor Michael Marmots research about what causes depression at work is how many of them talked about having been really depressed and anxious when they were, when they were working in this controlled way and their depression and anxiety had largely gone.

Speaker 2:          00:09:04       It's to have bad days of course. But there that kind of nagging depression and anxiety had gone away in this different environment. And as Josh said to me, there's no reason why any business should work in this top down controlled way that makes people depressed. It's not even more efficient. And study at Cornell University found that democratic businesses grow four times faster than, um, than, uh, you know, top down businesses. And I think, well, this opens up is a different way of thinking about depression. So what we've done up to now is we've said to depressed and anxious people, the job of fixing this is basically on you buddy, right? Maybe if you're lucky, your family, maybe if you're lucky, your doctor, but actually once you begin to realize that the reasons why people are depressed and anxious makes sense. This is just one of many reasons why people are depressed and anxious.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       It also, one of things is fueling the addiction crisis, which you can talk about if you want. And once you realize it, it makes sense. You suddenly realize what you've got to do is deal with the problem in the world as well as the problem just in the individual skull. Do you see what I mean? Yeah. So you're focusing on work environments, right? Um, and there's, there's many reasons, as you were saying, for, for people being depressed. Have you, when you talk about work environments, have you researched people who are independent, people who work for themselves, people who you know, make things or make furniture or what have you. Yeah. And that was one of the things as well at Baltimore Bicycle access, most people are so removed from the product, from their work, right, from the outcome of their work. To give you an example of a guy I interviewed a lot, um, guy called Joe, he works in Philly and he worked when I met him in a paint, a paint store, right?

Speaker 2:          00:10:36       And Joe's job was to turn up, but whatever it was, eight 30 in the morning, stay there all day until 7:00 PM and just take your order for pain. And then when you ask for a specific shade, his job was to put it in a machine that shook it, right? And then just give you the paint. That's it. That was his whole life week after week, year after year. And Joe was acutely depressed and Joe was really, felt really guilty about telling me how depressed he was. Right? He kept saying, look, I know how lucky I am. I know how lucky I am. Um, but he felt like it felt like shit. And he said, I remember him saying to me, look, I know people need pain. Right? It's not, I know that have some function here in the economy, I think to put it quite like that, but this is not giving me any sense of meaning.

Speaker 2:          00:11:15       But one of the real mysteries to me about Joe and for that had to learn about one of the other causes of depression and anxiety and solutions to that was so joe, a lot of people, some of my relatives who do work like that, that basically the margin for them to change their lives, it's really narrow, right? Like one of my closest relatives, it's a struggling single mom. Um, you know, she's, she works every hour. She can, she get something today collapses, right? The idea of saying to her, your job now is to democratize your workplace is ridiculous, right? She can't do that. That's why most of lost connections is about how we can change the culture to free people up to make the changes they need to make. Although there are things can do that I go through in the book, but the, but the, the, a lot of people, um, how to put it, they hit, we live in such an individualistic culture that people think what you're saying is you need to do it yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:12:07       But Joe was in an unusual position in that Joe, uh, loved fishing, right? He'd fished I think 20 of the 50 states, and he'd recently been to Florida and he said, you know, when I was in Florida, I am, I realized I could just quit this job. I could go and live as a fisherman in Florida. I'd make less money. I'd be much happier. Right. And there was somehow I knew as I was talking to joe and I filled it up with them over the years that followed, I knew he wasn't going to go to Florida. Right. And I remember, no, it's just the way he said it, it was a wistful longing and not musical idea, not something based on a real possibility. That's a really good way of putting it. But I remember the last time I saw him and he walked off I and I felt like a complete Dick for doing this, but I shouted after cause public.

Speaker 2:          00:12:49       So it's Toni Jo go to Florida. Right? Right. And one of these, it really troubled me was why are so, so a lot of people are trapped in the way our culture works, which is why we've got to change the culture. And I talk about specific concrete things that have been tried in other countries that have freed people up and have reduced depressions. I'm sure we'll get to that. But if you think about an individual like Joe, what's going on there? And one of the things I learned from this amazing professor Tim Kasser in Illinois, Knox College in Illinois is I think one of the things, this is one of the hardest courses or depression to learn about. Cause I realized how much it played out in my own life as well. So just like we all know junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick, right?

Speaker 2:          00:13:29       Something similar has happened with our minds are kind of junk values have taken over our minds. When I started learning about this, I remember I ate nothing but junk food for like 10 years from my twenties basically. And I remember one day, it makes it even the story, even Saturday, it was Christmas Eve in 2009 at lunchtime I went to my local KFC and I ordered, set my order, which I won't even repeat it to you cause it was so disgusting. And the guy behind the counter said, oh yeah man, we're so glad you're here. I was like, okay. And he said, wait a minute, wait a minute. And he went back and he came out and the whole staff fucking massive Christmas card for me and they'd written it to our best customer. And my heart is like sang because I look at this and I suddenly realized this wasn't even the fried chicken shop I went to the most.

Speaker 2:          00:14:13       Right. So I was at an extreme end of the junk food spectrum. Right? I'm not anymore. I've relapsed a bit lately, but, um, but, but so we all know how that works, right? Junk food appeals to the part of us evolve to what nutrients, but it tricks that it's not actually a part of you that wants nutrients. It actually makes you sick. Right. And what Professor Casio Fan, this is the similar things happen in our mind. So, um, weirdly, so for thousands of years, philosophers have said, if you think life is about, you know, money and status and showing off, you're going to feel like shit. Right? But it's not an exact quote from Confucius, but as the gist of what he said. Right. But weirdly, no one had scientifically investigated this until, uh, until Professor Cassa 25 years ago. So he knew that basically to put it crudely, there's two kinds of motives that human beings have, right?

Speaker 2:          00:15:02       You've got them. I've got them. Jamie's got them. Everyone's got them. Right. Um, the first that might just imagine, imagine if you play the piano, right? I'm totally, I'm musical. But imagine if you played the piano. If you play the piano in the morning, cause you love it. And it gives you joy. That's called an intrinsic motive to play the piano, right? You're not doing it to get anything out there. You're just doing it because you love it. Right. The experience is the point. Now I imagine he played the piano in a dive bar, you know, to, to pay the rent and you don't like it, right? Or you play the piano because your parents really want you to be a piano maestro. Don't know there's a woman who's really into pns, so you learn the piano to impress her. That would be an extrinsic reason to play the piano, right?

Speaker 2:          00:15:41       You're not doing it for the thing itself. You're not, you're not. You're doing it to get something out of it. Right. And what Professor Cassa discovered loads of really important things about this, but there's a few. We're all a mixture of these things, but we move throughout our lives. And what we discovered is the more you are driven by extrinsic values, the more your life is guided by how you look to the outside by you know, what you're trying to get out of life rather than enjoying it. The more you will become depressed and anxious by quite a large margin. There's loads of studies that show this. Um, and also he found that we have become much more obsessed with much more driven by these values over the last 30 years, but all sorts of reasons, partly because we, from the minute we're born, we're immersed in a machine that tells us life is about consumption, right?

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       About externally consuming things more 18 month old children know what the Mcdonald's m means, the know their own last name, right? So this, this machine constantly geared towards getting us to think extra. As I mentioned, imagine an advert that said to, you know Joe, you look great today. You, you smell great, you're doing fine, right? You don't need to buy anything today. That would from the perspective of the advertising industry be the worst, worst advice ever. I would make you want to buy anything. So this movement towards these kinds of junk values and any shows, lots of reasons why these junk values make us feel like share. One is it just corrodes the quality of your relationships, right? If your wife, if you think your wife loves you, not because you're you, but because you're rich, because you look good or for some other reason, then think about the insecurity that enters into that relationship.

Speaker 2:          00:17:13       You know? Oh, right. If you suddenly got fat or if you suddenly lost all your money, it's over. It creates that. That sand of insecurity enters all your relationships. The more you're extrinsically motivated, the more insecure your relationships will be in the worst you'll feel. Or another example would be something that really makes human beings feel good or what are called flow states right there. Moments when you're doing something you love the meats writing view. I'm sure it's partly broadcasting, partly working out as you can see it. It's not working out for me. Uh, the, the where you just get into the zone and time seems to collapse and you're in that moment, right? But what x thinking extrinsically, what being dominated by these junk Bonnie's does is it jolts you out of the intrinsic vice. Imagine you'd go back to the piano example. If you're playing the piano just because you love it and then suddenly you think, am I the best piano player in Los Angeles today?

Speaker 2:          00:18:03       Right? How are these people in this room thinking about my piano playing? How much am I gonna be paid for this piano player? You can see how that would jolt you out of the flow state. Right? People, the more we are driven by extrinsic values, the less we get into flow states and the worst we feel. And there's lots of other reasons as well one took about, but well that completely makes sense that relying constantly on other people's approval and recognition and love in order for you to be satisfied and happy isn't, is not a good recipe for getting by in this life smoothly. Um, when you were young and you were experiencing depression as you called it, what was the root cause of it? So in my case it was a, I mean there are a few things going on and this is difficult for me to talk about, but, um, one of the people I've got to know for the loss connections is this amazing guy called Dr. Vincent Felitti and San Diego.

Speaker 2:          00:18:51       And if you don't mind, I'll tell you his story first and I'll tell you why. What made me realize about myself and actually why I was very resistant to this. So it's going very resistant, resistant to this insight that he had and really did not want to absorb it. Um, so he actually made this discovery and sca cycle talking about a whole other subject, but trust me, I, it gets to depression. It led to an incredible breakthrough in depression. So in the mid 1980s, doctor Felitti is doing all this research into obesity, basically, Kaiser permanente or not for profit medical provider down in San Diego, um, just had a massive fucking problem with obesity, right? There is just hugely growing problem with obesity and, uh, they were trying everything and nothing was worth like giving people nutritional advice. That stage, it wasn't working right? So they basically said to him, they gave him quite a big budget and they're like, just figuring out what the hell is going on here.

Speaker 2:          00:19:41       So he went away and he started, he started to work within, think it was about 350 extremely obese people, right? People who are way more than 400 pounds. And um, he starts doing all sorts of different research with them. And at one day he just had this, this kind of almost stupidly simple thought. He thought, what if they just literally stopped eating and we gave them the nutrients they need? Would they just lose loads of weight and then come down to a healthy weight? So they obviously we'd like massive medical supervision. They did this right? People, they just monitor them and they stop eating and they give them loads of vitamins and everything and it worked right? They did in fact lose loads of weight. But then something happened that no one expected. There's a woman, I'm going to call Susan to protect her medical confidentiality.

Speaker 2:          00:20:23       She been over 400 pounds. She got down to 138 pounds and one and everyone's celebrating. They think vincent is like a miracle worker. And then one day she freaks the fuck out. Starts Massively obsessively eating. And very quickly she's back to not quite where she was, but close. Right? And Vincent sits with Susan and he's like, what happened? And she's like, I don't know. And he said, well, tell me about the day you cracked. Right. Tell out something had happened to her that hadn't happened to her in I think ever or sitting in a very long time. A man hit on her right when she'd been huge, you know, huge overweight, no matter down to a man hit on her. And that was the trigger, right? And he's like, okay. So they talk a lot more and it's like, when was it you started to put on weight for her?

Speaker 2:          00:21:03       It was when she was 11. Um, and so he's like, well, what? What happened when you were 11 that didn't happen when you were 10 that didn't happen when you were 12 or 50. And she said, oh, well that's when my grandfather started raping me and he, this just really start with him. So he starts talking to the group and he's got about 55% of the extremely overweight people in the group. I have 50% people in the group has had on their way after being sexually abused. Right. Which was an extraordinary, far more than the wider population is like, wait, what's going on here? This is really, Susan said to him, overweight is overlooked. And that's what I wanted to be. Right? So this thing that had looked like a pathology, right? And it is a pathology. One sense being extremely overweight will kill you.

Speaker 2:          00:21:43       Suddenly didn't look like a sign of madness. It was actually performing a function that we couldn't see, right? It was, it was, uh, it was protecting them from sexual attention. But you know, this is a small group. It's a small study. So Vincent wanted to get a lot more research on this. This is where it led to the breakthrough in depression. So he set it up with funding from the CDC, the Center for Disease Control, kind of gold plated a organization in this, uh, in the u s for this kind of research. Everyone who came to Kaiser Permanente in the next, uh, I think it was a year, uh, for anything, whether you broke your leg, you had migraines, you had schizophrenia, anything got given, a questionnaire and it asked about, it had two parts. Firstly, it said, did any of these 10 bad things happen to you when you were a kid?

Speaker 2:          00:22:25       Right? Could be sexual abuse, neglect, that kind of thing. And then it says, have you had any of these problems as an adult obesity, injecting drug use? And at the last minute they added depression, right? By luck. So when they got the results back, the CDC, we're just like, what the fuck is this? For every category of childhood trauma you went through, you weren't radically more likely to become depressed. If you had six of those categories, you were 3000, 100% more likely to have attempted suicide as an adult. If you were, um, if you'd had six of them, you were 4,000, 600% more likely to become an adult injecting drug user. Right? And there's a debate about why this is, and I'm going beyond what Vincent says now, but boom, what the science says, and this comes up, brings it back to my experience. So I had, when I was a kid, I had expressed some very extreme acts of violence from an adult in my family.

Speaker 2:          00:23:17       You know, my mother had been very ill and when I was a kid, my dad was mostly in another country. And I experience, he's really, really extreme, um, and frightening acts of violence. And I sound stupid. But until I went to see Vinson, if you'd asked me, do you think that played a role in your depression? I would have said no. Right? And it makes me realize one of the reasons why I clung to this very simplistic chemical imbalance theory of depression for so long, because I did not want to give the individual who behave so appallingly towards me, that sense of power over me. I didn't want to, I didn't want to think about that stuff. I want it to cauterize it. I wanted to cut it out of my life. I would say, well, okay, that's bad thing that happens to you, but you know, but the, but the reason why I stayed with this and the reason why I kept, you know, spent this time with Vincent in San Diego and the reason why I kept going with all these different causes of depression and anxiety is because once you understand what's happened, you can find solutions who otherwise didn't find, there was a second stage of doctor [inaudible] research.

Speaker 2:          00:24:23       That to me was so powerful. It's one of the reasons why I make myself talk about this now. So if you'd indicate it on the form that you'd experienced one of these forms of childhood trauma, the next time you went back to your doctor, you weren't called back, but the next time you went to your doctor, your doctor was told to say something to you like, hi Joe. I see on the form you indicated that you were violently abused when you were child. I'm really sorry that happened to you. That should never have happened. Would you like to talk about it and quite a lot of people said thank you, but no, I don't want to talk about that, but a lot of people did want to about an average conversations is lost the five minutes and then the doctor said, I can refer you to a therapist to talk more about this if you want, and they were monitored to see what happened.

Speaker 2:          00:25:05       The results were kind of incredible. There was an enormous fall in depression and anxiety just from the five minute meeting. Right, and from the obvious, people refer to therapy, so an even bigger fool and it seems to be, again, this is going to be this bit, it's going to be on what Vincent Said said. He said, I asked him, I said No. I think partly what happens is it's related to shame, right? If you are a kid and you experience some kind of abuse, you, you can basically do one of two things, right? You can either say, look, I'm fucked here. Right? I've unlike a pinball being smacked around a pinball machine because I can't stop this happening and I just got accepted and I'm really vulnerable. Or you can say, this must be my fault at some level, right? Um, which is what I did.

Speaker 2:          00:25:48       And of course it's what you've been told anyway by whoever is treating you badly in almost every case. And a weight thing is if you tell yourself is your full Angelie, you gain a sort of weird internal power, right? You're not the pymble being smacked around the machine. You're the person controlling the pimples sheet. You can change your behavior, right? You can't, you can't change other, the pencils paper. So you kind of develop this kind of shame. And one of the things we know is, and there's plenty of evidence from this. People like Professor Jim Pennebaker have shown it. Shame is a catastrophe for human psychology, right? We know, for example, openly gay man died two years later than closeted gay men in the age crisis, even when they got medical care at the same time, right? Shame destroys you. It makes you sick. And what Vincent found was this model of releasing your shame, which led to the significant, I remember one of the letters he got was from an old woman, she was in the 80s who just said she had been sexually abused when she was a kid. And she said, thank you for asking. I thought I'd die and no one would ever know. And you can see how that release of shame would have a transformative effect on people. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:26:51       So for you, you had this traumatic experience of violence when you were young, you were depressed, you were trying to figure out what the source of this was, whether it was some sort of a chemical imbalance in your brain. Now, when, when they say chemical imbalances is in the brain, have, are they capable of measuring the level of Serotonin in your brain?

Speaker 2:          00:27:12       Yes. So there's a huge debate about this. She couldn't, for example, do autopsies. Um, there's a big debate about, but that's when someone's dead. Yeah. But there's a big debate about, so there seems to be, most scientists agree low, not all of them. And there are some people who dissent from this, but most scientists agree low serotonin correlates with depression, right? But it's not the same thing in the same way stretch marks correlate with obesity, but they're not the cause of obesity that the product of it. So there are real brain changes that happen, which I write about in Los Connections and important to say that, um, that I don't think they should be described as chemical imbalances. But one of these, it was really shocking to me, was a, one of the British experts on this Dr. David Healey said to me, um, you can't even say the Sarah, the idea that depression causes serotonin.

Speaker 2:          00:27:52       You can't even say that that theory is discredited because it was never credited. There was never a time when half of the scientists in the field believe that. Right? The reason that story got sold to me and most people listening to this in the 90s is because it worked really well for the drug companies, right? Because what it makes it sound like if you've just got a chemical imbalance, the solution is just to give you chemicals. Now it's important to say chemical anti depressants do play a role. We can measure that. And there's a slightly nuanced point to make about this, which is, so depression is measured by something called the Hamilton Square, right? I've always felt sorry for whoever Hamilton was. The only way we remember him is by how fucking miserable we all. But anyway, so how to scale goes from one where you are, you know, dancing around in ecstasy or on ecstasy to 51 when you would be acutely suicidal.

Speaker 2:          00:28:36       Right? And to give you a sense of what movement on the Hamilton scale looks like, if you move six points on the Hamilton scale, sorry, if your sleep patterns get better, you'll gain six points on the Hamilton scale. And if your sleep patterns deteriorate, so you have a baby is crying all the time, you're generally lose six points on the Hamilton scale, right? So professor Irving Kirsch at Harvard medical school did the best research on this, and what he found is on average chemical anti depressants move people 1.8 points on the Hamilton scale, right? About a third of what? Improving your sleep patterns does. It's important to say that's an average. So some people do get more than that. Some people get less, and you can see 1.8 points is not nothing, right? If you're acutely suicidal, 1.8 points can take the edge off. There's real value in giving people that relief, but it's not solving the problem for most people. I thought I was weird for being on antidepressants for so long and remaining depressed. Turns out I was totally typical. Couldn't doctor Steven [inaudible] is professor of psychology has done a lot of work on this. Between 65 and 80% of people taking chemical entity depressants become depressed again. Right? So you can see that's not 100% there is some balance.

Speaker 3:          00:29:41       Well isn't that, that's what a bill of fives for right is a bill of fire is the idea that your antidepressant is not enough. So he take abilify on top of your antidepressant, which is supposed to help you even further, and it's one of the most prescribed medications in the country and it's an antipsychotic. Yeah. Well this is terrifying.

Speaker 2:          00:29:59       The doling out. I mean, one in five Americans will take a psychiatric drug in their lifetime, right? It's a sign of a, uh, a cultural madness that we are doing this right where the, now this is not to say that I want to stress again, there is a real value in these drugs. There is some value to them, there's some

Speaker 3:          00:30:14       value to them, but they're most certainly over prescribed and there's most certainly actual methods that you could use to improve your life without any sort of chemical intervention that are readily available to everybody. Like exercise and diet. Yeah, but those things aren't stressed when you, when you go to a doctor, the first thing the doctor doesn't say is, listen, what we need to do is get you to start running and get you start eating really healthy. And then let's talk about Antifa.

Speaker 2:          00:30:42       You're totally right. There's a $10 billion industry and that doctor giving you drugs, that's a crazy numbers you just said. And, and I think billion dollars. He said, this is why, although there is a real value for those drugs, would the the the why this is the first primary and for most people only option that's offered and one things that really helped me change think about this differently and it fits exactly what you're saying joe is I went to interview this South African psychiatrist, got Derrick summerfield and Derek happened to be in Cambodia when chemical antidepressants were first introduced. Right. That's where they were interested in energy. He was just there when they were first introduced in Cambodia. They thought that would have been one of the last countries in the world. They made their way to and the Cambodian doctors didn't know what they were. Right. So they're like, what is this?

Speaker 2:          00:31:22       And he explained and they said, we don't need them. We've already got antidepressants. And he said, what do you mean? He thought they were going to talk about some kind of like herbal remedy or something. Instead they told them a story. There was a farmer in their community who one day worked in the rice fields who one day had stood on a land mine and got his leg blown off. So they gave him an artificial limb and he went back to work in the rice fields. But apparently it's super painful to work in water when your legs been, you know, we've got an artificial limit. You legs been blown off and I'm guessing it's pretty traumatic cause he's in the fields where he's been blown up. He starts to cry all day, doesn't want to get out of bed. Classic depression, right. They said to Derek, we gave him an antidepressant.

Speaker 2:          00:31:58       He said, what was it? They said? They explained, they went and sat with him. They listened to him. They realized that his pain made sense. They realize that actually make Patrick sense that he felt so bad. They figured if they bought him a cow, he could become a dairy farmer. He wouldn't be in these fields where he was being fucked up. So they bought him a car. Within a couple of weeks he stopped crying. They said to Derek CC, Dr Kao was an antidepressant. That's what you mean right now. If you've been raised to think about depression the way we have, we've been propagandized to that sounds like a bad joke, right? I went to my doctor for an antidepressant. It gave me a cow. If you understand what all these experts who I met had been interviewed extensively, I've been trying to tell us it's going to know what the World Health Organization has been trying to tell us.

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       Those Cambodian doctors knew intuitively what they knew through the science, which is our pain. Makes Sense, right? You're not crazy to feel like shit. You've got unmet needs and what you need his help to get your needs met. Now some of the things you're talking about are really good examples. Exercise, Diet. Some of them are these bigger intervention. So one of the heroes, a lot of connections is this doctor I've got to know called Sam Arrington, who, who is based in, in east London actually, where near where I lived for a long time, very poor part of east London. And sadly he was never my doctor, but Sam was really uncomfortable because he's a general practitioners, general doctor. Loads of people were coming to him with depression and anxiety. Right. And He'd been told him his medical training, even though he knew the science was much more complicated than this to just say to people, you know, you've just got a chemical imbalance in your brain and just drug them.

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       Right. And Sam thought, right, like me, he's not opposed to the drugs. He does give them out to some people, but he just thought this is, this is not right. This isn't dealing with the reason they feel so shit. Right. So he tried a different approach. He noticed that one of the factors that was making the depressed and anxious was how profoundly lonely they were. It's a study to ask the obvious in Britain, but figures, it's sort of Britain by Cuban American examples to study the acid Americans. How many close friends do you have who you could call on in a crisis? When they started doing the study years ago, the most common answer was five. Today, the most common answer is none, right? It's not the average, but more people say none than any other options. So you think about that of people in America are more people in the United States have nobody to turn to when there's a crisis than any other option, right?

Speaker 2:          00:34:11       So you think about what life must be like when you're alone. That is not the species. We are the reason why you and I sit in here, Joe, in La, the reason why we're alive is because our ancestors in Africa on the savannas of Africa, what unbelievably good at one thing, right? They weren't bigger than the animals they took down, but they were much better at cooperating then the animals they took down. We exist because our ancestors formed into tribes. Every instinct we have is to live in a tribe right? Bees need a hive. Humans need a tribe. We are the first humans ever to try to disband our tribes. Right. No one's ever done that before in human history and it's quite running. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:34:46       Well, what do you, let me stop you there because we're getting deep in the weeds here. What do you say to someone who is happy with what they do lives, uh, a fulfilled life exercises and is still depressed. Yes. I thought a lot about this provoked me to come back to the thing about east London. I know this is, this is an issue with a lot of people. I, yeah, I know people that worship at the altar of science and modern medicine that firmly believe that all depression is because of some sort of chemical imbalance in the brain and anything that debates that are anything that disputes that notion is, is pisses them off. You know? I understand that. And I would have been like that for me. That, yeah, of course. I was looking at a a years. Do you get that? Some people responding that way? Sure, of course. Of course.

Speaker 2:          00:35:28       I think the, so the World Health Organization is the leading medical body in the world, right? They did a survey study of all the best evidence and they explained very clearly that the mental health, um, it's a social indicator, right? It has social causes, it needs social solutions as well as individual solutions, the science. So this is overwhelming. You won't get many scientists who say, uh, in fact it struggled to find any scientists who say depression is purely a biological phenomenon. Right? Pretty much everyone agrees there's some social and psychological component. I think when we, it's a weird disconnect between what the scientists know and what the public is told. Right? I don't know anyone who went to their doctor who, um, apart from this wonderful doctor in east London and we can talk about who went with depression. I, he was told anything other than a biological story.

Speaker 2:          00:36:14       Minute maybe asked, you know, some of them were asked about childhood, you know, what was your childhood like? And referred to a therapist. But no one was talking about these wider social causes. No one was started. Like, do you feel controlled at work? Well, like it's a fact that could be making you make you depressed. But in terms of the people who, who, um, who are depressed but don't, uh, cause there was a real mystery to me, right? I knew people I thought, but this guy has got everything and he feels he's still depressed. What's going on here? I think there's two things to say about that. One is I started to, uh, for various reasons for research, for something else, I was reading some like feminist texts from the early sixties. Right? And a really common thing that happened in the early sixties is women would go to their doctor and they'd say, doctor, there's something really wrong with my nerves, people to talk about in terms of nerves.

Speaker 2:          00:36:55       Then we don't do that anymore. Uh, something really wrong with my nerves because I've got everything a woman could possibly want. I've got a husband who doesn't beat me. I've got a car, got a washing machine, I've got two kids, but I feel like shit. Right? And the doctor would go, you're right, and give a value. Now if we could travel back in time and speak to those women, what we'd say is right, you've got everything you could possibly want by the standards of the culture. But it's standards, the culture just wrong, right? As a w as a woman, as a human being, you need more than just a washing machine and a car, right? You need a fulfilling life. You need to be a meaning and purpose. And a very similar thing I think is happening today if you, so if we don't want to speak to people, he said, I've got everything I could want, but I feel like share.

Speaker 2:          00:37:33       So tell me, tell me about your life. Very often they're working really hard in prestigious jobs that they don't like. They don't enjoy hour by hour to buy things that don't give them pleasure. It comes back to this hijacking by junk values that we're talking about. The professor Tim Kasser discovered. So what you've got is because we've been told a totally misleading story about what makes us satisfied and happy as human beings. I think it comes up again and again in the interviews you do. Cause we'd been taught in different ways because we've been told him misleading story about that we live our lives according to the wrong script. We feel like shit. And rather than question the script, we think there must be something wrong with us biologically. Now there are biological contributions. It's important to say that, but one of these, it really blew my mind on this was um, Ainsley this woman's amazing social scientists could talk of Bretford in Berkeley. She did this research. It's kind of simple research. It just asked. Um, if you consciously decided you were going to spend more hours a day trying to make yourself happier, would you actually become happier? Right? And they did this research. She didn't do a loan obviously

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       with our colleagues in the United States, uh, Japan, Russia, and Taiwan. And what they found was in the u s if you try to make yourself happier consciously, you do not become happier in the other countries. If you try to make yourself happier, you do become happier. And they were like, what's going on? So they did more research. And what they discovered was in the u s and suspend a lot more time here, but in Britain as well, if you try to make yourself happier, you tried to do something generally for yourself. You buy something for yourself. Your biggest Alpha [inaudible] tried to get a promotion in the other countries. Generally if you try to make yourself happy or you do something for someone else, right? You tried to help your friends, your family, your community. We're what countries? Just Japan, Russia, and China is most of the race stress this, that if you, this is a part of their culture that if you want to be happy, you do something for someone else.

Speaker 1:          00:39:28       It's so implicit in the culture that they live collectively, that it's not even just like we wouldn't even if you said, do you think happiness is an individualistic thing? We'd be like, what are you even talking about? Isn't that sort of an extrinsic idea as well? The idea that you're going to be happy by trying to make other people happy, but this is a thing. So intrinsic values are not about just internal to yourself. The things that you value, so your intrinsic value could be spending time with your kids, right? That was probably most people's strongest intrinsic value. If their parents, it's being with their kids, bonding with their kids, love. My point is if your goal is to get happy and the way you've chosen to get happy is I'm going to get happy by making other people happy. That's, that seems very strange.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       I don't think so and that's that. If you think about where humans shouldn't you just make other people happy because you love them, but that is a way of loving people and being present with them is a way but not as like a specific for with a specific goal of making yourself happy. That seems that's not why they do it. It's not like when they were told make yourself happy. They had an implicit script in their culture, which is like, all right, if I want to make myself happy, I'll spend time with other people or do things with other people. But if you think about it in terms of human evolution, it makes total sense, right? We think about our ancestors where they evolved. If you were a group, if our ancestors had been individually, so we're out to big up themselves as individuals, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:40:49       Right. So it makes us, we evolved as a species with instincts that are, there's no argument there. The the motivation of trying to get happy by helping other people. It just seems there's some implicit in the culture for most people in say China that they wouldn't even articulate it that way. It's only if you force them to say, look, try to make yourself happier that they, then the script becomes obvious. It's implicit. But this script that we have, this idea that the way you make yourself happier is as an individual, you know, just doing something for yourself and how you start because there is not one script in this country of how to make yourself happy. That I think that's of sort of disingenuous as I did at the only way to make yourself happy is to do that. What, that's not what people are trying to do.

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       What people were trying to do is be successful and I don't think they necessarily equate success with happiness. What would they do? Equate success with as an alleviation of debt and the alleviation of problems and alleviate a lot of the issues that people face. Hartley and they think of that as if you look at the problems that you have when you're growing up, you look at the price. Especially if you grow up in a poor family, one of the main problems that you face is you're worried about paying your bills. So you say some day I'm going to get to a point where that is no longer an issue. I'm going to make it. I'm going to be successful. They, they're not doing it thinking this is going to make me happy. I I've, I've, I very rarely see that and which is one of the reasons why people, even people's parents in this freaks me the fuck out.

Speaker 1:          00:42:18       We'll tell them to not pursue their dreams, but instead to pursue something that's more likely to happen. Like don't pursue your dream of becoming an actor or a singer or whatever it is. Instead pursue your dream of being the foreman at the company you work at because that's attainable. I think you're totally right and there's a lot of evidence that you're right, that the financial anxiety is a massive driver, depression and an anxiety. Obviously there's a interesting study that found people who have an income from property are 10 times less likely to develop an anxiety disorder that people who don't, and there was a really interesting experiment in how we can respond to that is when the President Obama said, lay in his time, he thinks would have to happen across the country in the next 20 years for various reasons. So in Canada, in the 70s, the Canadian government chose a town at random, it seems to genuine, had been random.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       It's tangled dolphin. It's, um, anyone who knows a canter. It's about four hours I, winnipeg, and they said to big group of people in this town, we're going to give you guys for the next, for the foreseeable future, we're going to give all of you a guaranteed basic income. We're going to give you the equivalent of in today's money, 15,000 US dollars. Right? There's nothing you can do. That means we'll take it away from you and there's nothing you have to do in return for it. We're just citizens of our country. We want you to have a good life, right? It was partly because they had a kind of welfare system, but it was a lot of people were falling through the cracks and they wanted to do a little experiment to see with this work better. And this was studied very carefully by women.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       I need to be called Doctor Evelyn for, uh, to see what happened in loads of interesting things happened. Um, people spent more time with their kids. Very few people quit work, but a lot of people turns down shitty jobs. So actual overall work standards improved because employees have to attract people with, with better standards. Um, but for me, the most interesting thing is there was a huge full in depression and anxiety, right? Depression and anxiety. That was so severe. People had to be hospitalized, fell by 9%, which is remarkable in just three years. And then the program ended. Dr for Jay said to me, I thought was so much about that, that I'd learned about the cow dot. To Vj said, um, you know, that's an antidepressant, right? We should expand our idea of an antidepressant to be anything that reduces depression, if I should include pills, but also so you're totally right.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       I mean, look, I grew up, my dad, my dad's a bus driver, my mom worked in a shelter, my grandmother, clean toilets, financial anxiety is a massive driver of, um, of the despair. This, I mean more than half of all Americans have not because of the incredible financial pressure they'd been put under. Got $500 set aside for, for crisis comes along. Right? So you're talking about that's a huge draw. And again, that's really important cause explain to people, if that's making you depressed and anxious, don't let a doctor tell you you've just got a chemical imbalance in your brain. Right? That's, we'll do doctors still say that all the time. My, my nephew's best friend, um, just literally a couple of weeks ago went to the doctor and was told, yeah, you've got a dopamine and balance. The doctor said is migrated in the 20 years since I went in there from a surgeon, England in England.

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       But I mean, I get contacted constantly by people who were being told they've got chemical, they're told they've got chemical imbalances in their brains. They just as likely to prescribe antidepressants in English as they are American. I mean, slightly lower, but it's still exceptionally high stills. Yeah. There's that narrative that an antidepressant must be in some sort of a pill form and that navy, even the expression, antidepressant and antidepressant, it's a very confusing thing that we've sort of adopted very quickly in this country. And it's a relatively recent, you know, over the last 60, 70 years. And the people that have antidepressants, uh, in their body that take them all the time and swear by them, boy, if you try to tell them in, in any way that there's a better option, they get extremely defensive. Um, I have friend, she's very smart and she's, she's one of the, um, one of the people that will, you know, very aggressively debate this idea that it's anything but a chemical, depression, chemical, a inbounds, you know, but she doesn't take care of her body.

Speaker 1:          00:46:21       She's not, she doesn't exercise all the time. You know, she's slightly overweight. She doesn't eat the best foods, you know, it's, it's, it's a weird thing. Well, and she's living in a society and culture that has all these forces that are arising that things will feel terrible. Right. And so a big thing to me is when I'm talking to this, because I've had some of that reaction as well, not too much, but I've had some of that reaction as well. First thing for me, I would say I want to expand the menu of options. I don't want to take anything off the table. Right. It's not about, oh, you say that. And I, and I think you're probably being pretty honest, but you really do want to, you want to eliminate mode. But just by the standard of improvement, you do probably want to take most people off of antidepressants.

Speaker 1:          00:47:01       Don't you want me to run it? They have a choice. I would draw an analogy. Obesity is massively risen in the western world. It hasn't risen because people suddenly became greedy and lazy. It's risen because our food system is terrible. The way feed supply system is terrible, and we built cities that people can't walk and bicycle around, right? And they're really stressed all the time and they get home from work exhausted so they don't have time to exercise a lot of them in that context. Some people will do what's the stomach stapling, liposuction, that kind of thing. Right now I'm not against that. But

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       if we change the society in the way that I would want to with obesity so that people could walk and cycle and you know they had access to healthy food, far fewer people would need stomach stapling or liposuction. Right? So I would drugs, not a perfect analogy, but I would say is if the social changes that I want to happen happen. If we followed the places that have succeeded in reducing depression and anxiety over time, you would see fewer people feeling they needed. And chemical antidepressants, you read it with a couple of things. First of all, I don't think it's access to healthy food. I think most people have access to healthy food. They choose not to eat it. They choose to eat refined carbohydrates, high sugar foods, fast food. Those are the things that are getting people fat. And I don't, I don't think that salad is so outside of the reach of the normal person.

Speaker 2:          00:48:16       I just don't agree with that. I just think that they make unhealthy choices. That's much more low end. They get addicted, but people make choices on carbohydrate. I understand what you're saying and I think there's some truth in it, but I think people make choices in a context, right? So, for example, um, you know, one of my relatives who is very overweight, you know, she's constantly fucking stressed because she's trying to hold together so much and one of the few reliefs in pleasure she has is to eat too much. Right? And to eat pretty shitty food. Right? I'm not critical of her for that. I what I want is to help her change her life and change the society in which we live. So she's not got that constant stress. Do you know what I mean? I mean, I think at this, in relation to addiction and you tweeted one smart, a Ted talk, I gave everything you think you know about addiction is wrong, which approach?

Speaker 2:          00:49:01       I'm grateful. Thank you. [inaudible] which is based on my previous, partly taken from my previous book, chasing the scream, which is about addiction. And I think about what you're saying in relation to that context. So we had a lot of addiction in my family. And, um, you know, one thing that really changed my mind about this, and I think it really relates to what you're saying about food is most people think, you know, addiction. It is a drug addiction. I say heroin addiction, right? Which is very close to me. Most with the heroin addiction. If said, what causes heroin addiction, they'd say Dark Heroin Causes Heroin Addiction, right? We've been told this story for a really long time that, um, you know, if you took, if we kidnapped someone off the street, we injected them all. We injected them with heroin every day for 20 days. At the end of that, they'd have this desperate physical hunger for the chemical hooks in heroin.

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       Their body would desperately need it, and that's, that's why they would be addicted, right? First thing that alerts him. In fact, something not right about that is when it was explained to me in Britain, if you get hit by a truck and you know your break your hip and you're taken to a hospital, you'll be given loads of a drug called diamorphine. Right? For the pain diamorphine is heroin is much better than street heroin because it's medically pure, right? If anyone listening to this as a British grandmother who had a hip replacement operation, your grandmother's taken a lot of heroin, right? If what we've been told about the chemical hooks is right, what should be happening to all these people in hospital? Loads of them should be becoming addicted. It doesn't happen in Britain with with people who are given Domo theme, so it's like, well, wait, what's going on?

Speaker 2:          00:50:24       I only began to understand it when I went to Vancouver and needs to be this incredible professor. They're called Bruce Alexander did this experiment. It's changed how we think about addiction I think is very relevant to what you're saying about food. So this theory, the chemical hooks, theory of addiction and chemical hooks are real. They're just a small part of it. The Chemical Hooks, theory of addiction comes from a series of experiments that were done years ago. They're really simple. You take a rat, you put it in a cage and you give it two water bottles. One is just water. The other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine. If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water and almost always die quite quickly. Right within think is a week. So there you go. You might remember his famous advertisement for from the 80s so there you go.

Speaker 2:          00:51:02       Right? That's our story. But in the 70s professor Alexander came along, I said, well hang on a minute, you put the rat alone in an empty cage or it's got nothing to do except use these drugs. What would happen if we did this differently? So he built a cage that he called rat park, which is basically like having verace, right? They can, they've got loads of friends that can fuck all the time. They'd got a grain they like and colored balls and they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drug water. But the fascinating thing is in rat park, they don't like the drug water that much. None of them used it. Cut. Some of it, they do use it, but none of them used it compulsively and none of them ever overdose. So when they deprived of the things that make life meaningful, they turn obsessive Lee to the drug.

Speaker 2:          00:51:40       When they've got the things that make life meaningful per rats, they don't the opposite of addiction, isn't it? Sobriety? The opposite of addiction is connection. I think you can see similar principle playing out with food, right? Of course there's some margin to the individual. I don't want to say that we're, we're not entirely the [inaudible] for reasonably far away from this woman, these, these people that were on this dire morphine. So why are you saying that they don't get addicted to it because they go back to their lives meaningful. There's a human example that happened at the same time as rat park. Why are their lives particularly meaningful in relationship to like the lives we're talking about here? So I think you can see in an example, a good example, it was happening at the same time as rat park and experiment, the Vietnam War, right?

Speaker 2:          00:52:17       Huge numbers of American troops in Vietnam. About 40% used heroin. Right? Um, and if you look at the reports from the time they were shitting themselves, cause they were like, my God, when the war ends, we're going to have all these heroin addicts on the streets of the United States. They're going to come home. And because they believe the chemical hooks theory, it's a really good study in the Archives of General Psychiatry by Professor Lee Robbins that followed these guys hope, my select group of them. And what it found was at 95% of them just stopped, right? It didn't go into some catastrophic withdraw. Some of them did experience some physical discomfort, but they didn't. You know, they didn't. Now, if you believe the old theory of addiction that you're taken over by the chemical hooks, that makes no sense, right? But they've been exposed to all the same chemical hooks as any homeless street, street addicted person to be on the streets. Um, but if you understand this different way of thinking, it makes perfect sense. If you took you and me now and put us in a hellish pestilential jungle where we don't want to be, we could die at any moment. We'd be made to kill people. You would definitely survive longer than me. But we were both find heroin a lot more appealing than we do now. Right. And then when we come back to our lives, when we have meaning and purpose, we would find heroin a lot less appealing. The core of addiction is not wanting

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       to be present in your life because your life is too painful place to be. So when something, an intervention happens that reduces the amount of pain in your life, you could be less addicted. There's a very challenging, like Marianne faithful, you know the British rocks, I was to stop you right there because there is a giant issue though with people taking pain pills after operations that weren't on pain pills before. And then they get addicted to them. So that's because a lack of meaning in their life or is it because there is an absolute real chemical hook? Like, I have a good friend who had his nose broken and a, they fixed his nose and he got on some, I think it was oxycontin afterwards they prescribed to them and then four months later he's taking it every day, all day. So there's a few things about that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:06       Firstly, chemical hooks are real, but they're a small part of the picture. We know how much they are. So this experiments that measure this, so we, um, lots of people want to take him. In fact, some people listening to this will be taking part in this experiment. Now when nicotine patches were invented in the late eighties and they become marketed in the early nineties, there's this huge wave of optimism, right? Cause the chemical hook in cigarettes is nicotine. Nicotine patches give Ya the chemical hook you're addicted to. Um, and so there was this huge, wait, what? They're like, great, we're going to give people the camp because it's, the diction is caused by chemical hooks. We're going to give them the chemical hook. They'll stop wanting these filthy smoke smoking's going to end, right? And in fact, what happened is 17% of people, according to the US surgeon general's report, when they take nicotine, use nicotine patches and they're motivated, stop smoking.

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       Right? Really important to say 17% is not. No one big number that has saved hundreds of thousands of people's lives at a conservative estimate, but still leaves 83% where something else is going on. Right? But isn't that because of the delivery method? The digital delivery method of cigarettes is incredibly satisfying. You take a hit, you get it right into your system and boom, you get that nicotine, their transdermal, it's very slow. It's not the same feeling. Yeah, there are there experiments that show there is pleasure that comes from the delivery method, but it's also about self soothing. It's about anxiety. It's about boredom. Um, and this is very important to relate to the opiate crisis. So one in 130, um, opioid prescriptions resulted in addiction, right? So it's a small number, but at catastrophic and devastating number. And I reported from the places that have been most affected like this by this like keene in New Hampshire.

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       One in what, one in 130 if the users become addicted. That's it. Yeah. It's a relatively small proportion now that cause so many people in the country wrong. Yeah. I can send you the study. That's the, the best studies that got that. And that's in the United States or in the UK, in the United States. We've got, that's one in 130 prescriptions. But bear in mind that some people get more than one prescription. So, you know, but, um, the, but one of the things that's really important to understand about that is the context in which this is happening, right? In Britain in the 18th. And this totally relates to what I write about in lost connections about depression as well as in chasing the scream about addiction in Britain in the 18th century, there was this thing that happened called the gin craze, right? So huge numbers of people are driven out of the countryside into these disgusting urban slums where, you

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       know, they're living in this office, they've lost everything that made like meaningful to them. Right. And what happened was an outbreak of mass alcoholism, huge outbreak. It's called the gin craze. There's famous paintings of like a woman drinking a bottle of gin while her baby falls out a window, that kind of thing. Right? And it really happened, and at the time what people said is, look at this evil drug gin. Look at what it's done to people. If only we could get rid of these evil people selling this evil drug gin, this problem would go away. Now when we look back at it, we know that can't have been because of Jim, because we could both have jen in these glasses. Now anyone in Britain can go and buy gin at any point, pretty much. And if they're an adult and we don't have, I mean there's still some alcoholism.

Speaker 2:          00:57:01       Of course there was some despair. Yeah, it's caused a lot changed. It's not the availability of the drug. What changes the amount of pain in the society. And that is the key factor that's playing out here with opioids, right? It's not the only factor. Chemical Hooks are real, but you know, I'm a Brazilian guy. He was absolutely adamant that, you know, he, he become medically addicted was an accidental chemical. Hooks are taken him over. He'd been a college athlete. Right. And he was in a particular about 21 he was in a terrible car accident and they get a, and they gave him loads of opioids and it became a doctor. But then I said, well, tell me about what's going well. So it's going on today. He couldn't be a college athlete anymore. It's a whole life had been built around being an athlete and because of his injuries, he couldn't become an athlete anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:57:40       And I said, well do you think it might have been related also to the despair around that? It doesn't take long for people. I think part of the promise, because we've got such stigma about depression, anxiety, addiction, people will latch onto the biological explanation, whether it's the chemical imbalance theory, the chemical hooks theory as their path out of stigma. Where's, to me, you shouldn't be stigmatized in any fucking circumstance, whether it's because you're in pain, psychological pain, physical pain. Did you see the point I'm making? So I think one of the reasons why we're so committed to this, and it's not even a good way out of stigma. I can explain to you happy ones are interesting evidence about that, but did you see the point? I'm making job.

Speaker 3:          00:58:14       I do see the point that you're making that people with lives that are unsatisfying or unfulfilling or there's some sort of a major issue in their, like the athlete that's no longer going to be able to be an athlete, that that's going to make these drugs more enticing. I, but I know too many people that have had like real issues getting off of them, like physical issues. We're no one to painful for withdrawals, of course. And most people, I mean you're talking about the same people that have a hard time not eating shitty food, right? They have people that have a hard time getting disciplined enough to go to the gym. These are the same kind of people we're talking about. They're going to have a massive problem. If you give them pills and those pills create a chemical hook, even if it's a chemical hook that you or I or a discipline person would be able to get. Like Dr. Carl Hart famously called it, he said, it's like getting over the flu. He goes, that's what heroin is like. Everyone wants to pretend that you're going to die. He goes, no, you feel like shit for a little while and then you're fine. He goes, it's not the thing that everybody makes it out to be withdrawals or not the thing that everybody makes it out to be, but, but if you have the average person and you give them pills and those pills can keep them

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       from getting the flu, they're going to keep taking those pills. And if they stop taking those pills, they get the flu. People are comfort, jumpy junkies, and I think it's does too simplistic. I think there's some truth in what you're saying, but I think the key thing that happens, so I think doctor to is t who's a friend of mine is totally right, but the, the, the physical withdrawal is, you know, a flu is not a nice thing, but it's not the most onerous thing in the world. But the thing that's really devastating is the resumption of the pain that you were in east, that psychological pain that you were nice. The timing with the drug, right? Right. Do you want to understand why people are taking so many painkillers? We've got to understand why they're in so much pain. And that comes back to the nine causes of depression and anxiety that arrived in las connections and then the kind of seven solutions to this problem that I offer.

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       So again, that's about if are, so let's say Joe, right? Joe In the paint store who I was talking about, who's, you know, he who has this job he can't bear, has very little a meaning in his life, feels his life is just slipping through his fingers. He took oxy for quite a long time. He actually contacted me because of my, my book. Um, and because, and, and my ted talk, and he thought he was telling me a story about addiction. Right? But the truth is when he took oxygen, he was numbed. It made him as numb as the work itself. And then when he stopped, he was acutely depressed and felt like shit. So I think the challenges, if you are coming off of this drug into a society of profoundly lonely and isolated people who are financially insecure, who've been told that life is about money and status, who, who, you know, who, who think life is about screaming at each other three screens, a lot of those people are gonna feel like shit.

Speaker 2:          01:00:54       And it's not because they're individually week, right? It's become that and maybe individual witnesses. Of course, we all have flaws. Every human being has flaws. But I think it's much more because the fact that it's risen so much tells you that it's a response to social changes. Right? Just like the fact that obesity has risen so much tells us now there are course individual agency. I don't want to infantilize anyone that are things individuals can do obviously. And I talk about them a lot in lots connections. But I think the fact that it's a social transformation, um, does tell you something, there's a, a good illustration of this kind of weird thing that was discovered about depression in the 70s that was so inconvenient that psychiatrist tried to brush it under the carpet. So in the 70s, the American Psychiatric Association for the first time, what it to standardize how depression is diagnosed across the u s because up to then doctors were just using their own judgment about what it even was.

Speaker 2:          01:01:43       Right? So they drew up a list of 10 symptoms, kind of obvious things like feeling worthless cry and a lot, you know, you could guess where they were. And they send this out to doctors all over the US and uh, they use it but a cup of, within a couple of months. Dot. To start to come back and go, look, we've got a real, we've got a problem here. Because if we just use this checklist, we should be diagnosing every grieving person is mentally ill because these are the symptoms of grief, right? Everyone, when you lose someone, Cope wants to cry a lot, fit, you know, has persistent feelings of sadness, that kind of thing. So like what do we do? So the psychiatrist regrouped and were like, okay, we'll create something. It was called the grief exception. Basically sad. Use this checklist to diagnose depression unless the person has lost someone they love in the last year, in which case none of this counts.

Speaker 2:          01:02:30       So they start using that. But over the next few years that followed this, this really awkward debate, cause they're like, wait a minute, we're being told to tell our patients that depression is just a brain disease. That you can just identify from a checklist. Unless there's one situation in life where it's perfectly legitimate to react this way. But at that begs the question, why is that? Why not? If you made homeless, why not? If you'd stuck in a shitty job, you hey, why not? If you're really lonely, the minute you admit all that, you have to admit context and that was so inconvenient. They just got rid of the grief exception that doesn't exist. A fascinating fact and that seems to be a huge issue. That seems to be one of the primary reasons why people today. I mean if you, if you stop and ask the average person today who's not feeling well, I guarantee you they're going to be able to come up with at least one or two of those things on the list that are, that are factors who totally right and is there.

Speaker 2:          01:03:28       It's a job or financial stress, relationship, stress, loneliness, friendship issues or death in the family or losing someone they love, but the fact that losing someone their love like, Oh, we'll count that. That's the one thing that's seems very preposterous. And the woman who did the most research, and this is one of the best people I've got to know for loss connections when we could talk to Joanne [inaudible], he's an amazing person. She lost her baby in childbirth. Babies called Cheyenne and she became an expert on this and she said, you know, she talks about the craziness of this. It just shows we don't understand pain in this society. Great. She said, she put it to me. We don't, grief isn't a pathology, right? We don't need cheap. She's done this research that shows, I think the figure is 32% of grieving parents are diagnosed and drugs in the first 48 hours after their child dies and she's, this is a sickness, right?

Speaker 2:          01:04:16       That that grief is not a pathology. We grieve because we've loved someone, right? It's not a malfunction. It's not sign of madness. It's a sign that you loved the person and the way I'm going to be on what she says now, but you know, I think one of the things, the fact that the depression and grief had the same symptoms is really significant because I think depression is grief for your own life, not going how it should, right? It's grief for your own needs not being met. Now when someone we love dies or we can do is hold the survivors and love them, right? But with, um, but with, um, with your own needs not being met, I mean, a really interesting sample or there's something you've kept brilliantly on the show, joe about psychedelics. I'm the researcher on Psychedelics, which taught me a lot about how we might think about this differently.

Speaker 2:          01:04:58       So as you know, uh, you know better than anyone the, until the mid sixties loads of research was done giving Lsd to people with depression, alcoholism, both problems. They weren't done to the standards. We want to do scientific experiments now, but they found really promising results and then Nixon shuts the whole thing down. Right. In the last six years, there's been a huge reawakening this, I went and interviewed blas connections, the teams that have worked on this in um, uh, here in la at Ucla, Nyu at Johns Hopkins, in Baltimore, in London, at Ucl, uh, in Sao Paolo and in Norway. And loads of fascinating things and in fact about this. But there's one that I think really relates to our conversation powerfully. Um, w well, loads of things, but we'll talk about one. Um, so there was a sub finding a, one of the studies that I became obsessed with, they did this research at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, some of the leading scientists in the world where they gave psilocybin the active component in magic mushrooms to um, chronic longterm smokers who tried everything to stop smoking and had not succeeded.

Speaker 2:          01:05:59       Right. I've thought about my mother a lot because my mother is a chain smoker. This is a photograph of me and her when I'm six months old, she's breastfeeding me smoking and resting the ashtray on my stomach. Oh my God. Uh, and, and so they take people like my mother, right. I'd already, when I showed her that picture, she said you were fucking difficult baby. I needed that cigarette. It's a how they try to blame you when I was a fucking baby. She, she's a good person, but the, the, the, so they take these people quite a longtime smokers and they gave them three doses of psilocybin over, think it was six months. It was six months. So two month intervals of thing. And what they found was extraordinary. 80% of them stop smoking. Right? And it still remained not smoking more than two years later.

Speaker 2:          01:06:40       Incredible. Think about, we were comparing it to 17% but nicotine patches and they were like, what's going on? So they did all this research in this. And what we've gotta be careful with psychedelics is to not talk about it the way we were misleadingly told about antidepressants, chemical anti depressants in the 90s, which is, oh, it flips the chemical switch in your brain. Clearly a chemical process happens in the brain, but, but what they found, I think the most important thing and the lesson for people who don't want to use psychedelics as well is a sub finding. So if you take, if you take psilocybin, most people will have a kind of spiritual experience, right? Um, some people will have a super intense spiritual experience that people have in Melbourne and a minority will have no spiritual experience. It turns out the positive effects, like reduction in depression and addiction correlate exactly with the intensity of the spiritual experience.

Speaker 2:          01:07:28       So if you have no spiritual experience, you don't have, but here's isn't is dose dependent? No, this cut across those. So they gave him three varying doses, doses, I can't remember, but it's in the, it's pretty significant though. That's a very important factor. Yeah. So across the three, so you were given it three times and you always given three different doses, so obviously you would have more. Most people have much more intense experience with the most, with the strongest dose, but the, the key thing I think about that, that finding is that one of the experts put it to me. It's not that it's a chemical process, it's a learning experience. What it does is it gives you an experience of what it can feel like to be deeply connected, to feel deeply connected to the people around you, to the natural world. Incredible, strong, natural antidepressant that we can talk about if you want. Have you psychedelic experience? When was a teenager? I bought some and I think they were a drug dealer in Canada. Tam Market. I'm holding off because I've got to go to the Amazon rainforest later this year and I want to use Iowasca for the first time in the Amazon. Never had, cause you know I'm getting that from the way you're describing it. It's interesting. I interviewed huge numbers of people who had, tell me what you're, what you're getting. That's interesting.

Speaker 3:          01:08:32       Well this the what it is is a dissolving of the ego. That's a general factor that almost everybody reports. Um, it also releases you from deeply ingrained patterns of behavior and thinking and, and highlights them. So as much as it is a spiritual experience, it's also a dissolving of the self. And the, the, the way we define ourselves is oftentimes very limiting. You have this, this is the way I describe it and this is the way I described very powerful psychedelic experiences. It's like, do you remember the old windows thing? Control, alt, delete. That's how you'd reboot. It's like control, alt, delete for your brain and your brain reboots with a fresh new desktop. There's nothing on it except one folder. And that one to folder is titled My old bullshit. And you have two choices. You can either start fresh and try to re examine the world with fresh eyes or what's more convenient as you slowly slipped into the my old bullshit folder and start opening it up and repeating patterns in lighting that cigarette up when you really shouldn't. Having that drink when you probably shouldn't do that either. And those things are common because it's comforting. It's comforting for people to repeat patterns that they're familiar with.

Speaker 2:          01:09:46       I think it's a few things in that you're totally right and the scientific evidence is overwhelming. In fact, at Ucl, University College, London, Professor David Nutt did all this research that shows it. One of the things that happens in your brain when you take psychedelics is the part of the brain that relates to ego just doesn't function right and then be interviewing. One of the most moving into I did was a guy called mark who was in one of the studies in Baltimore who, um, was a very shy, reserved shutdown guy when he was 10 his dad had died and no one had talked to him about his dad's death. His mother was just totally devastated and no one had talked to him about it and he'd always been very shut down. And he takes the psilocybin and he had this really intense experience where he, he thinks he's in space and he believed he met his father and his father apologized for leaving him.

Speaker 2:          01:10:33       And then he reached into mark and he pulled out these walls and he said, I want to thank these walls. They've protected my son. They've done a good job, but you can let them go now. And after that mark really changed how he lived there. She went, she said he was able to sustain that insight. He went and learned a lot of meditation. Um, I think, I think you're, you're, you're absolutely right. It's about dissolving the ego and what an experience of Eagles egolessness can do is almost point a direction on a compass. Right. But there's another aspect that emerged in that, which I think is one of the slight differences between us. I like the, I, I think there's a lot in what you're saying. So in the, in London, they, this research with chronically

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       depressed people. And Robin Carhart Harris, he led that study. He said to me, you know, there's one woman chronically depressed, she takes the Psilocybin, she gets everything you're saying, the dissolution of ego, the need for all the things you're talking about. And then she goes back to her job in a shitty seaside town where you just can't live compatible with those insights. Right. She just couldn't. And so her depression came back. So to me, what the size of it, where individuals can change the lives. Obviously they should. Right. And we would totally agree on that. And a lot of people do have more margin to change their lives and they think, and we're in total agreement on that. And I think you would probably agree that there are some people who are, you know, through no fault of their own, like a lot of my relatives fucking stock, right?

Speaker 1:          01:11:56       And then the very people will have no margin of change. But a lot of people have such a small margin to change, but that margin will not carry them out of depression or anxiety or addiction. And that's why we need the widest is what the World Health Organization says. You need social solutions as well as individual solutions. When to change the way the society works in all sorts of ways that reduce the things that are causing this pain in the first place. Do you see what I mean? Changing the way society works though is a grand in, in tangled, gigantic undertaking. Whereas changing your own life is not so actually doing your own life is difficult. It can be very difficult for a lot of people, but it's far easier than changing society. I understand what you're saying. Who you're telling me has the psychedelic experience experiences this dissolving of ego, this beautiful spiritual awakening, but then goes back to a job that's like opening up the folder of mild bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:12:51       It's the same thing. She's going back to the same patterns. Well I would say she's being forced into that folder cause she's what she gonna do, but lean, what she's going to do is what a lot of people do. I mean a lot of people change their lives. I mean it's not impossible to do. I don't know if this woman had kids. I didn't ask it. Well, imagine being, even can't imagine people being stuck big. We makes it very difficult. It makes it very difficult. But she's not in jail. She's not a president. At some point you're making. But I think actually, and this might sound strange in some ways, I think changing the society is easier than isolated individuals changing their, so I'll give you an exam. How is that possible? Well, I'll give you some, but I'm gay, right? Um, if I think about the incredible transformation I've seen in my life.

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       So I tell the story in Los Connections about my friend Andrew Sullivan, right? 1994, Andrew was diagnosed with HIV. His first thought was, I deserve this, right? He'd been raised in such a homophobic world. He thought, you know what? I deserve to have this, this illness. It's going to kill me. He was watching his friends die all around him. He thought it was about to die. This is before protease inhibitors and it goes to province town, little town in Cape Cod to do what he thought would be the last thing he would ever do. Right? And he wrote a book about crazy Utopian idea that he thought, this is never going to happen. I'm never going to live to see this. But maybe generations from now, this is what happened. It was the first book ever arguing for gay marriage. Right? And if I get depressed about this, try to imagine going in time and saying to Andrew,

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       okay, noted. I've, okay, I've got some good news. 25 years from now, you're going to be alive. But that's not the good news. The Supreme Court of the United States is going to quote this book in their ruling, making it mandatory for all states in the United States to introduce gay marriage. And the next day you'll be invited to the White House, which will be lit up in the colors of the rainbow flag to celebrate with the president. And by the way, that president is going to be black, right? That would have sounded like ridiculous science fiction. Now imagine saying to gay people 50 years ago, you're not going to change the society. That's way too hard. When you can do is focus on changing yourself. Actually, gay people would be really fucking miserable if that's what they'd done, right? If that's how it was, my life will be immeasurably worse if gay people are just said, you know what? It's so hard to change society. Let's change ourselves. We would've remained trapped in Shitty, awful institutions and systems that kept us down. I actually think, if I think about most of the people I know who are depressed, to be honest, their margin for individual changes limited, but banding together, their margin for change is huge, right? It's thinking about which was about the universal basic income for example. Right? Massively. We're getting, we're going to another subject here, so she'd gone. Then it's you. You keep going on one to the next,

Speaker 3:          01:15:25       shut up with one. It's far easier to explain to one person, one life why it's wrong to be homophobic than it is to change all the rednecks and all the ignorant people who don't read and all the people that have deeply ingrained archaic religious ideas about homosexuality. It's far easier to educate and luminate one person and it also can be done with the aid of psychedelics, especially MTMA therapy. This one of the things that maps is doing right now with Mtma therapy and they're, they're involved in a bunch of clinical trials right now, helping people to all sorts of traumatic stress experiences, soldiers, people that experienced physical violence, all these people that are, it's helping them alleviate a lot of the problems that are life. There's patterns that people are that they have in their mind that they can release. Sure, you could release and you can be educated and you can understand.

Speaker 3:          01:16:19       You can change and grow as an individual. It's far easier to do that with one person, for one person to change their life. Then it changed an entire culture. I do agree that there have been great strides in this country when it comes to discrimination, when it comes to racism, when it comes to so many different ideas. But I think that's connected to the exchange of ideas that we're experiencing now because of the Internet. I think because of the fact that there's so many different arguments back and forth and there's so many different ways to approach things that people are being forced to change their opinions. Even more religious people today or more open to homosexuality than they have been in the past. I've really believed that is a factor of all the information that's available and the, the, the amount of communication I amount of gay people that people know from television, from news programs, from all these different shows where they get a different sense of, you know, do you see Ellen everyday? Well, gay people can't be Evil Ellen. So Nice. You know what I mean? There's a lot of that.

Speaker 2:          01:17:16       I think you're totally right, but I think that shows that the first thing you said is, is too simplistic. So the thing is that the division between the, I think the last thing you point you made is totally on the money, but why didn't you were saying that the division is the idea that is easier to persuade individuals and persuade the society. You persuade the society by persuading individuals who just persuade lots of individuals and they banned. Sure.

Speaker 3:          01:17:38       Well, okay. I think we're splitting hairs here because I think if obviously if you change every individual, you change society, but it's far easier to change one person than it is to change 350 million.

Speaker 2:          01:17:48       But that's obviously true. But you changed 350 million by changing one person and one passport by banding together. But you also, one of the ways that you changed those one p that one person is by banding together in a group, right? So gay people for example, would be a good example, but there are many, many good examples. But what you're saying about individual psychology, it's important to say you're, you're right about that. So there are, there's a very broad scientific agreement. There are three kinds of cause of depression and anxiety. And most mental health if at all, mental health problems, they're, the ratio varies. So there's biological causes, which we talked about. Your genes, for example, can make chemo sensitive to these things. There's psychological causes, which are the things you're talking about, which are very real and important. And there's social causes so that, you know, a lot of the other things we've talked about, and I think at a way you don't need to play them off against each other. They're all real, right. And you want to deal with all of them. Um, so it's not, I don't think it's a, I want to get to argue with you. It's like you're saying we should deal with the psychological factor. And I'm saying we should deal with the social factor. You're totally right. We should deal with that. I think we should deal with Bob. Yeah, exactly. I think where we certainly, do, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          01:18:49       Yes. Yeah, yeah. But I think that the idea that, so like think of what you're saying in terms of people, uh, living unfulfilled lives, living in job or working in jobs that they don't enjoy, where they're being controlled by a boss, it's far easier for one person to choose to change the path of their life than to try to restructure society where that doesn't exist anymore. I agree. Ceos like this is what this is, is intent. There's a Ma, I mean obviously that was a huge factor in the 2016 election. It was one of the things that was talked about is a wealth inequality. Well, there's no greater version of wealth inequality than the difference between the CEO of a massive company and its lowest worker. I mean, it literally is like a king and a peasant. It's a very strange sort of a structure that very recently has it become.

Speaker 3:          01:19:43       Yes, yes. But it's so common. I mean, it is, it's ingrained. I mean, how many corporations are there that operate like that top down? I mean it's, it's gigantic. And to change that I think would be far more difficult than to change an individual's path and to tell this one person, hey man, what do you really want to do? Do you really like making pottery? Well, they, you should try to make pottery for a living because this working for chemicals, you're not going to ever feel fulfilled. You're always gonna have that same anxiety on Sunday night before you go to bed. You're always going to feel like shit while you're at work. You're always going to be numb. You're going to be probably listening to the podcasts like this while you're working just to try to pass the time. I think you're right

Speaker 2:          01:20:23       and totally, if, if you can do it, if you've got that margin per change, 100% my advice to you is that why wouldn't you

Speaker 3:          01:20:29       be able to do it eventually? You might not be able to do it right now, but if you plan for it, why wouldn't you be able to do it?

Speaker 2:          01:20:36       I think about one of my closest relatives, right? She's, she's very depressed. She's got two young kids. She's working really hard. She's in a Shitty town. Um, she has very controlled work. I'm trying to think. I've desperately tried to think of the margins of change that I can help her facilitate in her life. Right. And I've really struggled. I mean it's an environment where most people are depressed. Most people are obese. This is England. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean it could've just as easily manageable spent a lot of time in the u s but I think it's more people with this problem in the u s um, you know, now I think we've essentially cut off case. That's a very nice, anyone who has any margin of change I go through in Los Connections, the seven ways you can change your life, that the science at shows will reduce her depression and anxiety.

Speaker 2:          01:21:27       Very likely, right? If you've got that margin. Do I think the only disagreement trends is, I think you're more, um, you, you think more can be done by individual will alone than I do probably. And I would say, but that's not disempowering in the sense that I would say the most powerful individually empowering thing you can do is band together with other people like you and fight for something better. Right. Work together towards improving yourself with the people in your community and making some sort of a bond. Totally. And one of the most moving things I learned about from the book was this incredible protest movement in Berlin. I can tell you about if you want that transformed. It really is one of the places where so much of, of what I, what I learned from the scientists really fell into place with me and it was, were very isolated.

Speaker 2:          01:22:12       People came together and just said, you know what? We're not going to take this anymore and fought for something better. I can explain that it's a longer story, but if you want me to tell about the world, but the, so I think you're right. So you were saying, you know, what do you like to do when you said pottery is an example of, that is a good example. But I will say it may be that what you like to do and actually cause we're a social species, this is what most would like to do is get together with the people around you and fight for something better. And I think you're totally right about how this played out in the dynamics around the election. I remember. So it really haunted me. I was um, with some people who were doing some get out the vote work in Cleveland and Cleveland.

Speaker 2:          01:22:48       I mean it's like Detroit without the poetry of the rooms, right? I mean it's shocking. And we were on this street in an area called Slavic city. Um, that a why it's not slavic and we're going, what do you say that, I mean there's great parts of Cleveland each on in this area and the area. Yeah, sorry to be climbing the area that I was, okay, sorry. I should have, it was this area of west Cleveland called Slavic city. Not the hot kick your ass. Clearly not the whole Cleveland is like, that's right. Is that dude who had a t shirt at one of my shows that I put on my instagram. People in her death. They're fucking serious about Cleveland. They have the heavyweight champion of the world, steep vimeo chick who lives in Cleveland. So we're, this street is one of those respectfully, not representative of all of Cleveland.

Speaker 2:          01:23:29       Right? Well, I mean you can find a place like that in la. I'll take you to skid row right now. Oh sure, sure. We could just go to beverly hills. You're your choice. You know what I'm saying? It's not an Einstein, but the, just just about the street that there was this, we're going down the street and a third of the house has been demolished. A third were abandoned or third store have people living in them. Some of them like literally behind barbed wire. Right? Sounds like a children's math problem. Sorry, not 15 people live in this place. I knew heroin. If they've walked the streets, how long does it take care I oxycontin 15 people live in that place. They're on antidepressants. Who's happier? So we, we knocked on one door and there was a woman who, from looking at how I would have guessed was 60, right.

Speaker 2:          01:24:09       She was actually the same age as me. I was 37 at the time. And she was very articulate. She was, she knew that she knew a lot. She was really fucking angry. She was raging. And um, she made this verbal slip that's really stayed with me. I thought about it while you're speaking earlier, she talked about the area used to be like for parents and grandparents, right? And she meant to say, when I was young, what she actually said is when I was alive, I was like, fuck. That's how she feels, right? She feels like she has died. And it made me think about this, this other researchers think about that. She was saying, this, I think relates to the individual versus collective debate that we've kind of been touching on. So native American groups in Canada, they call them first nations groups have really high suicide rates.

Speaker 2:          01:24:54       Right? Um, and this professor, I got to interview person, Michael Chandler did this really big research on this because what we realized is 196 first nations groups in Canada, some of them have really high suicide and some have none. Right? And he's like, why is that? So He'd spent 10 years researching this, discovered loads of things. But one of the things he discovered was some of these groups have basically been able to fight to regain control of their community. Right? They rebuilt their language, they've rebuilt their scope, control of the schools and you know, whatever. And some have just been so cut down that they haven't been able to do that. Suicide rate correlates really tightly with the amount of control they were able to regain over the community in the amount of meaning that you find in your life. I think it's about meaning, it's about having a story about who you are.

Speaker 2:          01:25:38       It's about having social connections around you so you're not alone. You're part of something bigger than any side. Exactly. So I think when you, when we were talking, I thought about that when, when you were saying, you know, what, what do you like to do? What should you do if someone's listening to this and they're lonely and isolated, you know, because we're such a fractured society and because we find it so difficult to be present with each other, right? The, the, the, the constant distraction and refracting everything through screens, which makes us be like, shit, I can talk about some of that if you want.

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       Um, the, the, the actually that, that initial step is quite hard because we're so broken up, right? So it's not just the initial step, it's you've gone too far in one direction. Like say, look at it this way, if we all started this neutral point, right? And W, uh, someone like Jamie does what he wants to do and, and finds a good path and starts going in that direction and keeps improving as life and then eventually is a happy human being as an adult. Or you have someone who goes the wrong way. They get addicted to food and cigarettes and drugs and antidepressants and they get into bad relationships and then they have children that they have to take care of them. They have a job that they hate and then they find themselves at 37 years old looking like they're 65 trying to figure out how to get back.

Speaker 3:          01:26:52       Well, they've got to find a way to not just move ahead, but to get back to that neutral point, this, they have to go back in time over all the shit they fucked up and they have a far longer path. So it's not an impossible path, but it's a far longer path. If you all, if everyone's going in a direction and that direction is 25 miles away, but you go 37 miles backwards, you have to go sell 37 miles forward and then the additional 25 miles. That's the problem with people. They look at the, the, the daunting nature of that task and it's very intimidating to them and they don't feel like they can make it. They don't feel like they can, but there is satisfaction and hope and happiness and moving towards a positive direction. And that's what people have to realize. It's not about a goal.

Speaker 3:          01:27:43       It's about the journey being a positive journey and the feeling that you get of improving your life incrementally on a daily basis. And it's also the mindset that you carry with you on that journey. You can't look at yourself and go, God, why am I not successful yet? Why am I not rich? Why am I not this? Why am I not that? You have to say, I am better than I was yesterday. Tomorrow will be better than I am today and I'm on the right path. And there is a lot of deep satisfaction and happiness and being on the right path. Now, if you're a person who wants to be an author, but instead you're an accountant every day you spend not feeding that idea that you can be an author is going to chew away at you, it's going to chip away at you and it's going to move you away from that neutral point.

Speaker 3:          01:28:30       Many, many miles. I totally agree. I totally agree with you and I think that the, that thing about when people realize they have agency, that's one of the most, especially, and it goes back to what was saying about work, if you will, spending nine hours a day being controlled, one of the things you do to get through that, is it a process of internal deadening? Right. I remember talking to just a, the guy in the paint store, he would say, you know how it would just get home, go home, and initially it was alcohol and then later oxy, he would just want to numb himself. Right, right.

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       Because there's an internal deadline you have to do to get through that. Which is why I think one of the key aspects that I talk about those connections is this transformation of work. If the thing that most people are doing most of the time is making 87% of us would, we don't like it at the best bat. You've got to go to the heart of that. Right. And, and you know we're talking about margins or change. People who set up that bike store in Baltimore, they were working class people. You know who, who I'd not had fancy educations. They set up a democratic cooperative, right? They, they, they transformed their lives. So they were a good example of people who appear to have a relatively limited margin. They were low wage workers in a, in a, in a low wage industry who, you know, have made this transition.

Speaker 1:          01:29:42       So I'm certainly not saying that people can't make these transitions even in difficult circumstances. They absolutely can. I just think, um, yeah, I think I'll think about the, the, the farmer in the field in Cambodia, right? Whose legs blown off and he's in this field and it's agony. He needed to change his life, but he also needed someone to buy him a cow. Right? He couldn't have bought that couch on his own and that situation, yeah, he would be an illustration or, um, or the rats in rat park. Right. If you're in that isolated cage, I mean it's not a great example because you know, the rat can't leave the cage. Whereas you could argue, but you see the point I'm making. I do. You could attribute it just to individual. I know this is not what you're doing, but I think some people, um, attribute this just to, uh, is definitely what you're saying.

Speaker 1:          01:30:27       But just to individual weakness or individual failing, what I think that the identity is psychology is a significant component of that alongside other components. I don't think of it that way at all. I think I think of it as poor choices. I don't think of it as individual film. I've made many, many poor choices in my life. Here's one of the big ones. You could tell people because there's a lot of people that are listening to this at various stages of their life. If you're young and you have an open future, you don't have massive obligations and debt and all the, all the different things that become a real hindrance. As you get older, move towards a direction that is attractive to you. Do not move towards a direction that is safe. Don't do it. Because if you do do that, if you just take that safe job and then there's a lot of people that will know, a lot of people can do that.

Speaker 1:          01:31:12       That is a bullshit stupid way to think and that will fuck you that that way to think we'll fuck you. You can do what you do, what you choose to do. You can get better at things. If what you choose to do, you can move forward and try to figure out a way to carve a path through that life and it's not going to be easy, but nothing worth doing is easy. But this idea that it'll give you want to just do construction if that's appealing to you, you would like to just be a laborer and there's, there's look, there's a need for that in society, but it doesn't bother you. It's, but find out what bothers you and find out what you enjoy. If you're a labor and you really want to be a songwriter, well you better fucking chase that songwriting shit. You better do it because if you don't do it, you don't want to be a 60 year old man sitting around just depressed and crying. Then maybe you call

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       your friend up who does do that for a living and he's having a great time and he just released his new album and you both started out together in high school and now here you are at different stages of your life and you, you haven't pursued your interest, you haven't pursued your passion, you haven't pursued what you really want to do. I, but to endorse every word you just said, I would just add a layer alongside it, which is, and we should change our society so fewer people get trapped and more people at the moment, a lot of people feel we want to be giving people trampolines up. Right? Yeah. I think universal basic income is probably a way that that's going to start happening. Yeah. I think that can happen. That can help a lot of people where your basic needs, your food is taken care of.

Speaker 2:          01:32:40       And I think President Obama talks about this towards the end of his term, partly because he said, look, um, actually I don't attribute this to him. I can't move. He said it made this point in this way, but it was interviewed wired magazine and he said he thinks this will have to happen in the next 20 years. Partly because of the extraordinary disruption that's coming to the economy through robotization automation. Exactly. So Elon Musk said that recently as well. Yeah, well I think Elan Musk is saying it for slightly different motive and that he knows the pitch books are going to come from people like him and Mark Zuckerberg. The anger is going to be directed at Silicon Valley if there isn't a universal basic income. I'm sure they have genuine concern for people as well. But I think the, so you think that's really why he's, he's saying that, oh my God, maybe I'm just more cynical because they just make so much money.

Speaker 2:          01:33:22       Well, I can't remember who said that. Someone said, you know, the path the economies are, and there's going to be seven tech billionaires and everyone else employed to give them massages. Right? And I think there's something going on here, which is I think they know at some level if they don't start providing some, if the society doesn't start providing some baseline of security, I forget the figure. I think 3 million people in the United States make a living through driving that's not going to exist in 10 years from now probably right. Self driving cars are likely to just, that's going to be gone, right? That that's an extraordinary disruption to the economy. Those are mostly men. They're mostly men with low educational achievement attainments for various reasons. A lot which are not their fault. Um, and, and you know, that's devastating, right? So I think you're right, the universal basic income is one of the important strategies that can, that can kind of deal with that.

Speaker 2:          01:34:10       But I think this comes back to, I think you, you've got your going back to think that there is a kind of recurring theme in this conversation, which is, you know, for both my books for chasing the scream and pulse connections can addiction and it depression, anxiety. Both of them required me to go all over the world and just look at really different places that do things really differently. And there was some things that just Rickard for both, right? Give example with addiction, the places that have most reduced addiction have not been the places that have said this is an attributing this to you very clearly are not saying this, but people whose the places that have said this is a problem for the individual and the individual needs to fucking sort themselves out, have a massive and growing addiction crisis from gets worse and worse.

Speaker 2:          01:34:49       The places that I went to where they said, actually this is a collective problem. We need a collective solution. We're very different. So Portugal for example, in the year two, how one of the worst drug problems in the world, right? 1% of the population was addicted to heroin. It was incredible. Every year the problem got worse as they tried the American way more and more rested, more people in prison, more people. And one day the prime minister and the leader of the opposition got together and they were like, look, we can't go on like this, right? We can't have ever more people in our contributing data to heroin. Where are we going to do? So it was quite bold thing. They set up a panel led by an amazing man. I got to know doctor [inaudible]. Um, and they said to this panel, you guys go away, figure out what would actually solve this and we've agreed in advance.

Speaker 2:          01:35:30       We'll do whatever you recommend. Right? So they go, it'd be like if trump and chuck Schumer and Nancy Polosi agreed, they would, everyone would abide by finding on this. So they go away. They look at all the evidence including rat park loads of the things we've talked about. They came back and said, decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack everything. But, and this is the crucial next step. Take all the money we currently spend on fucking people's lives up on arresting them, shaming them, stigmatizing them, imprisoning them, and spend it instead on turning their lives around. And interestingly, it wasn't really what we think of. It wasn't, there was a little bit of residential rehab. Most of it was a big program of job creation. They set up micro loans so people with addiction problems could set up and run small businesses about things they cared about.

Speaker 2:          01:36:10       They set up a big program, subsidized work. So, um, you know, say you've used to be a mechanic, they go to a garage, they say if you employ this guy for a year, we'll pay half his wages. Right. The results in Portugal have been incredible. Couldn't the best scientific study published in the British journal of criminology injecting drug use fell by more than 50% overdose deaths, massively fell HIV massively fail. One thing that was so striking there was going around and speaking to people. I mean one of the most moving into that, if the chasing the scream is with them, a guy called wildfit guerra who was the top drug cop in Portugal, and he led the opposition to the decriminalization when it first happened, right? [inaudible] he said, this is fucking madness. We're going to have a massive explosion in drug use. It's going to be a nightmare.

Speaker 2:          01:36:49       And he said to me, everything I said would happen, didn't happen, and everything the other side said would happen, did. And it talks about how he felt really ashamed that it spent 20 years before the decriminalization fucking people's lives up. And I think that goes to the debate that we're talking about because that was now that's individuals changing, right? That's very clearly individual changing, making better choices, but they're making those better choices in a context, a context where the society, instead of beating them down, it's trying to lift them up. But you see what I mean? It's a very good, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:37:15       good point. It's a very important point. And what Portugal is done should be studied by our country, which is now falling right back into the old Nancy Reagan. Just say no bullshit days with Jeff sessions at the helm of catastrophe. He's a terrifying person in that regard cause he's so ignorant as to what's going on. He's so ignorant. He's still calling marijuana gateway drug. Yeah, he's a fool. I mean, he really is. And that the, the pattern is terrifying because they're trying to call Kratom and opiate right now. There, there's, there's all sorts of a resistance to what we know of as safe alternatives to pharmaceutical medications like cbd. That's another one they're demonizing. They want to categorize that with heroin

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       and cocaine. It's fucking terrifying. It's, it's, it's a very, very weird time because there's so much evidence and so much science and so much history when it comes to things like Portugal where it's been successful to decriminalize everything and spend the money on treatment programs, but they're ignoring that. They're ignoring that because it's convenient. You're so right. But my concern is it's not. I've Jeff sessions is, you could imagine what I think about Jeff Sessions is disgusting and insane what he saying. But my worry is it's not a, well, I've worried about jeff sessions primarily, but my other worry is it's not just jeff sessions. I actually think even our side, you know, when it comes to the opioid crisis, I think had been talking about this and quite quite the wrong way. So it made me realize actually how deep this Nancy Reagan's script is in the culture that even liberals, my side of politics, it basically been saying their story about the pharmaceutical, the opioid crisis is basically evil drug dealers came along, they gave people these drugs, they got accidentally hurt.

Speaker 2:          01:38:52       In this case, the evil drug dealers or the big Pharma, they've got them accidentally hooked. Um, and that's why we have this crisis right now. There's, as you can tell from our conversation and antidepressants, there's a lot to criticize big farmer about. I'm very critical of them. But that story is just ridiculously simple. If that were true, antidepressant prescriptions had been given across the United States, right? If that were true, it would not make sense. Now the opioid prescriptions are also concentrated. The opiate addictions are also concentrated in the places where suicide is highest, where depression is highest, where of course it's some everywhere, but there's a reason for that, right? Angus Dayton, the economist who studied this described the opioid deaths, despair, deaths, right? If you go to the places where you turn, right, we're in the country and when I go to places that have been most affected by the opioid crisis, what's going on, he said he'd been deprived of the things that make life meaningful, so they want to be an Easter ties to all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:39:48       There's a devastating line. Marianne faithful. He was, Mick Jagger is best known for being Mick Jagger's girlfriend, but kind of pisses me off cause thinks she's even better than Mick Jagger, but she was, I know it was controversial. Better than Mick Jagger. There's controversial, I best fucking conversations. Shut it down, Jamie. So Marianne Faithfull had a heroin addiction in the 60s when she was homeless and she has this very challenging line in her. In her memoir, she says something like, heroin saved my life because if it wasn't the heroin, I would have killed myself. Right. And don't misunderstand what I'm saying. Heroin is not a good solution to despair if we want, if clearly for all sorts of very obvious reasons, if we want to understand why there's been this huge increase in opiod use, we have to understand these things that I'm writing about. His connections to the World Health Organization is explaining this deep kind of dispatch.

Speaker 2:          01:40:31       And my worry is that, cause you're back to the worry about how our side is getting it wrong. So we've got jeff sessions getting it wrong in the most obvious, insane way, right. You know, it's just we need to crack down on the Mexicans and that will store it. We, the United States has spent $1 trillion on the war on drugs. It's done it for a hundred years. It's imprisoned more people than any other country in human history. And at the end of all that, you guys can't even keep drugs out of your prisons where you pay people to what we're on the fucking perimeter the whole time. So good luck keeping them out of a country with two, 3000 mile borders. That is so ridiculous and so absurd that it's not just that. It's why would you think that you could tell a grown adult what they can and can't do with their body?

Speaker 2:          01:41:09       Of course, boss, that really simple. I think I'm, I'm pretty sure all of your listeners agree with this on GSA or pretty much all of them agree that on jeff sessions, what I think more of them will be tempted by. We'll be the more liberal argument. I says as the liberals are not attacking liberals, but the, the more liberal argument, which is this simplistic, even Bernie Sanders who I love and would have voted for, uh, well I think he, he's got this wrong, which is the, uh, although I think Bernie Sanders has politics would deal with some of the deeper problems as well. Clearly, but there's this story that it's about the drug companies. We've got to look at the one place that solved an opioid crisis. If we talked about Portugal, the one other place. So Switzerland, I'm a Swiss citizen, come my dad's from there as well as British, obviously tristle until a massive heroin problem in the 90s right?

Speaker 2:          01:41:51       Huge. Almost as you know, not quite as bad as what's happening at opioids say, but it was massive and uh, Switzerland got this amazing kickass female President Call Ruth Dreifuss to explain to people that when you hear the word legalization, what you picture is anarchy and chaos, right? What we have now is anarchy and chaos. When you prohibit drugs, what you get is unknown criminals selling unknown chemicals to unknown drug users all in the dark filled with violence, disease and chaos. What she proposed to do is legalized heroin, right? It's important to understand that. Well, that doesn't mean it doesn't mean there's like a heroin Ireland, the cvs in, in Switzerland, right? So different things that can be legalized differently. I don't know the rules in La, but I'm pretty sure you could legally if you wanted to own a dog, a monkey and a lion.

Speaker 2:          01:42:37       But I'm pretty sure the rules are different, right? Yeah. I don't think you're going on a monkey. You're aligned. But you could, you know, if you really wanted to one, and you were reaching and you could get them in Texas, in Texas for something that you could do whatever the fuck you want, except you can't have pot in Texas. Hilarious. So it's pretty sure in Texas it's licensed. So you could, you know, they're all legal, but they're legal in different ways. Right. And it's similar way. What Ruth Dreifuss, the Swiss president was praising his heroin should be legal, but not in the way that alcohol is legal. So the way it works is if you've got heroin problem in Switzerland, you're assigned to a clinic. I went to the one in Geneva where the former president now lives across the street, which tells you something and you go, you, you, you got to go early in the morning for reasons I'll explain.

Speaker 2:          01:43:14       You're giving your heroin there. You can't take it out with you. You've got to use it there. And then you leave and you go to your job cause they give you, they do two things and it's the exact opposite of what's been proposed in the u s what's being priced in the USA is stop prescribing and don't give support. Right. Well they didn't think Switzerland is exact opposite in Switzerland. They'll give you the drug you were addicted to and then they give you loads of support to figure out why you're in such pain in the first place. That helped me get housing. They get your subsidized work. Um, they give you loads of therapy that you, are you aware of a booger? Yeah, of course. Yeah. But that's probably one of the very best ways for people to quit drugs, especially some horrible drug.

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       And it's a ruthlessly introspective drug that many, many people have found great success and kicking heroin, cigarettes, alcoholism, uh, getting over past abuse. I mean, it is, it's a long experience. It can last more than 24 hours. Totally illegal in the United States. But a lot of people go to Mexico and do it. And I've had very good friends that have had problems with pills that went over there and kicked him because of the Boga does a, you should, I'll give you a purchases and intro to doctor Gabriel. Marta it, Brenda don't really know who he is. He would be a great guest for you as you live in England and he lives in Vancouver but he comes to La fellows in, you should definitely talk to you, recommend people look it's wet. But the, in terms of just to stay with the last point about Switzerland, because there was something really, I think it relates to a bike or in a way.

Speaker 1:          01:44:38       So one of things that really surprised me and that spending time in that clinic, I remember there's chief psychiatrist, they doctor Rita Mangus. So they will give you as they will give you any dose you want except one that will kill you and there is never any pressure to cut back, which really surprised me. So you could go to this clinic and they'll dose you up with heroin. They give you the heroin, you have to use it there. You can't take it out with you because I don't want them sell it. People selling it on. And also it's kind of bad ass. You're monitored by a, by a, by a nurse. But, but the results are pretty incredible. Right, right. So, um, the, well, the headline, most important factors, there have been zero heroin overdose deaths on legal heroin in Switzerland in the 12 years that program has existed.

Speaker 1:          01:45:16       Has the ratio of people using to not using, how's it gone down? Really significant fall in heroin use because of best researchers by Professor Ambrose Oakton Hargan who's shown there been no deaths in the legal program and an enormous fallen deaths in the illegal program and enormous spalding use overall, the various reasons I can talk about. But the thing that blew my mind was so they give them every day as they want for as long as they want. And I was like, oh, but what we're told is that comes back to chemical hooks. What we're told is they'll just want more and more for ethical. Right, right. But actually what happens is almost everyone chooses to cut back over time and stop. Right? When I went in there, I think there were like two people who've been on the program at the stock, and I said to doctor Manga, who runs it?

Speaker 1:          01:45:52       I don't understand this. How is this happening? And she looked at me like I was an idiot, and she said, well, people's lives get better and it's their lives get better. They don't want to be anesthetized so much, which seems almost stupidly obvious, right? Goes right back to what you were saying about antidepressants and people's lives, like the choice that you make and the paths that you take and the people you surround with and the happiness that you feel from your community. That's ultimately what leads to a fulfilling life. And if you have all that, why would you fuck it up with heroin? Right? I think you're totally right that the whole premise of lost connections is becomes what song we were saying at the start, human beings have needs, right? And if your needs are being met, you don't want to be an extra time. I think what you said is very important, that there's psychological needs that are just as valuable and important as physical needs. Like we know we have needs for nutrients, we know have needs for water, we have needs psychological for all sorts of different, our communities

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       are incredibly important. Love is incredibly important. Family's incredibly important. You know, I know some people that are older men that uh, have been bachelors their whole lives and their child lists and now they're, you know, they just, they don't have a deep connection with anybody and they get to this very weird, strange place where they're like, is this it? Now I'm 70 years old and I've never really had children and I don't know what to do and this is, this is my life now. And it's, they, they've, all their friends have had families now and their families, a lot of times the kids are grown up and it becomes very, very strange.

Speaker 2:          01:47:28       No, I thought about that a lot. Intubate this guy and professor John Kasey Opo at the University of Chicago who is the leading expert in the world on loneliness. And he said this thing to me. So it's a bit like what the woman in Geneva suddenly way to live your life studying. They, uh, they had this really interesting, it's a very simple point, but it just said, if you think about the circumstances where we evolved, right? If you got separated from the tribe, if you were alone, you were depressed and anxious for really fucking good reason. You were about to be eaten. You were in terrible danger. If you got injured, no one would help. You would die, right? So all the, he showed that, as you know, when we're, when we're stressed, we release a hormone called Cortisol. He showed this wrench to experiment. They wrote about in the book being acutely lonely is a stressful as being punched in the face by a stranger when it comes to cortisol release, right?

Speaker 2:          01:48:15       That's how deeply we are resistant to loneliness, right? It's a signal telling you to get back to the tribe. That's why we bought, it's a really important signal. If humans hadn't had that signal, we wouldn't be here. Right? Um, and I think you're right. So when you look at these, these men, if you have an isolated, there was this woman, so I covered this incredible protest movement happened in Berlin on a big anonymous housing project when no one knew each other and they came together to protest. It was a woman who was about to kill herself because she was about to be evicted. And the whole housing project came together to say she should be allowed to stay in our home and they should have a rent freeze. And it's an amazing story. I'll tell it in the book, but there's something, one of the women said to me that I never forgot it was called narrow man.

Speaker 2:          01:48:59       She grown up in Turkey and she come to Germany, I think when she was 17 she said, when I grew up in Turkey, well I called my home was my village and everyone in it. And then I came to live in the Western world and I learned that what you're meant to call home is just your four walls and if you're lucky, your family. And then this protest began and we all got to know each other. And this whole place became my home and I think everywhere here is home now. And, and, and she realized that, that we are homeless in some sense in the western world. The US humans have a need for a sense of belonging. And our sense of home is too small to meet our sense of belonging. There's a wonderful, a Bosnian writer called Alexander Heyman who said, um, home is where people notice when you're not there.

Speaker 2:          01:49:45       Right? And a lot of like these guys you're talking about is all the guys who notices if they're not, they're probably no one probably are in a sense homeless, right? They'll spiritually homeless. And um, I said, that's it. I'm not a religious person. I don't mean that. Yeah. He'd go through saying, you know what I mean? And so I think it's about, and this comes back to think about how different that is, what everything we're talking about, they can have different, our conversation has been to what my doctor told me when I was a teenager. And I go in and I say I'm in real pain and I feel like pain is leaking out at me. And I can't control it. And he says, you've just got a malfunction in your brain. Right? What are the worst things about that? There are many things wrong with that.

Speaker 2:          01:50:23       Firstly, what he said to me is not true. Um, uh, I'm sure he believed it. I think he was misinformed that I think he was deliberately lying to me, but what he said was not true. But also to me, the biggest problem with just telling this exclusively biological story about depression and anxiety. There's some real biological factors of course, is it cuts us off from having this conversation, right? All those people you were talking about who I was so insistent as I was to that depression is just the result of a chemical imbalance. If you think that it disconnects you from the source of your pain, it tells you your just biologically broken and presumably always going to be biologically broken when the conversation we're having, which is a different conversation. It's a difficult conversation, is a nuanced conversation. It's not simplistic. It's not one problem, one lever to solve it.

Speaker 2:          01:51:08       It's a much deeper and more, uh, textured way of thinking. That is the conversation we have to have. That's what the best scientists in the world are telling us. The World Health Organization and my worry is, um, we're just being pushed in it. Like you said, that, that, that broken metaphor about driving 37 miles in the wrong direction. Right? We're just driving in the wrong direction. We're driving away from the source of our pain rather than towards it where it can be understood and solved. Of course, it's always going to be some pain in human life, but the fact that we have this one in five people taking a psychiatric drug, you know, I think the figure is one in 10 13 year old boys is taking a stimulant drug to make them focus. I think the figure is 30% of old people in, in retirement homes have been given antipsychotic drugs to shut them the fuck up because they're rebelling against the way they're being treated.

Speaker 2:          01:51:54       In between one in four middle aged women in the United States is taking a chemical anti depressant at any given time. One in four, one in four. You're talking about that a society that, I mean the figures about how many children is much lower, but it's so much more extreme. The F number at number toddlers who have been given antipsychotics in the United States is just off the scale. Right. Um, I think doctor Sammie to Mimi has written about this, there's some extraordinary figure, I'm not getting figure slightly wrong, but it's something like a majority of children in foster care in the United States are being given stimulant drugs basically to shut them up. Yeah, that's, that's a disturbing one. The ritalin and rarely various stimulants that they give to children. Um, what's that about? What's the cause of that? Well, I think it's related to research as much less than the other things we've talked about.

Speaker 2:          01:52:43       But from it, it came up a lot in the conversations that I had. There are many things going on here. One of them is, um, a lot of the, so a lot of the, not all of them, a lot of the causes of depression and anxiety that I wrote about, I couldn't help but notice reading all the research into being the scientists also can lead to, um, decrease in focus and attention. So for example, if you are dead end at work and you, you feel controlled all the time, you have to deaden yourself to get through it. It's harder attention's a muscle, right? It's harder to bring your brain back to focus. Like Joe wanted to just go and collapse and watch, you know, watch whatever shit was on the bachelor or whatever. I would watch the bachelor actually, whatever shit would have been on the [inaudible] on the TV. Um, so one is full state of depression in the bathroom.

Speaker 2:          01:53:30       He was prepared to take oxy but not to go to that level of self harm. Right? But the, but the, or think about loneliness, right? There's really pressed casio potion. This, if you are lonely, that triggers what's called hyper vigilance, right? Again, for very good reason. If you're on your own in the savannas of Africa, right? You want to be hypervigilant, of course. So you find it, one of the things it was most challenging to me is this evidence that the people with the lowest levels of attention problems and depression and anxiety in the United States or the amish, right. And I am a atheist, gay liberal. So the idea of going, it's like learning something from the Amish was initially challenging to me. And I've got a mare, I felt really humbled by going and spending time with, I went to this village called [inaudible], which is just outside of Fort Wayne, Indiana.

Speaker 2:          01:54:16       And you know, there's still a lot I disagree with about the Amish. Don't get me wrong, not least cause I just rewatched witness, but, uh, the, but, but you know, they, I could see that they've got, so it's very interesting about the army. She's, you know, when you turn 16, if you're an amish, you've got to leave and go and live in what they call the English world, our world. Right. And then you decide whether it's come back about 80% decide to come back. 20% don't. It's one of the reasons why the amish is never counted as a cult because no cult would do that right now. Call. It's going to tell you to leave for two years and then decide whether to come back to the fact that the exact opposite. So they have lived in our world, they know our world really well.

Speaker 2:          01:54:52       And even having this very challenging conversation with, um, what's his name? Lauren beachy. His name is an amish guy there who said there cyber, because back to the weight conversation we had, he said, um, but there's loads of things I miss. He talked about missing that seventies show. He said, I used to love driving in trucks because they obviously don't drive that ultra steer off the grid. And he said, but you know, if I kept those things, I wouldn't spend time with my family. I wouldn't spend time with my children. I wouldn't, I wouldn't know who my neighbors were. And we said the spreadsheet, angelic thing, he said, you know, weight watchers. And I said, yeah. And he said, well, the idea of weight watchers is you can only lose weight together as a group, right? It helps or not only, but it helps you to lose weight together as a group that you would find it harder on your own. This is like that. And I said, what are you saying about the amish is like weight watchers for the problems of Western civilization? And he's like, yeah, that's what I'm saying. And to me that was so challenging. The idea that you've got to give, because we comes back to what is there a junk news in our culture, we told the solution is always to get more. And the idea that the solution is to have less and be present more is really challenging. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:55:53       I don't even think it's about having less, it's about what they're doing is look, eat, think about what the amish are doing. First of all, massive sense of community, right? They're very connected. They're not using cell phones and not using email. So the community is also based on one to one interaction, real social cues, real social interaction, which is critical. It's a big part of being a human being and it's one of the more apps and things in modern society to physical labor. They're involved in a lot of physical labor because they don't use electricity, they don't use power tools. There's so many things that they don't do, so because of their culture, they're making their own homes. All right, so they have a vested interest in helping each other, working together as a community and they have a deep sense of satisfaction of constructing each other's homes.

Speaker 3:          01:56:38       You construct my home with me, I help you build your home. They take care of their animals, they take care of their crops, they take theirs. There's a real connection with where they get their food from. A real connection with where they live, their community, the sense of just the whole, the sense of belonging to something that's bigger than you. It's a, there's so many factors involved in their happiness that you can kind of see where it, yeah, there's a lot of wacky shit with the, the cult aspects of, of being an amish person. But what you get out of it, it's almost like if you had a self help group that subscribed to all the positive benefits of being amish and they just called it like regrounding or something like that. And you just go out there and you become a part of nature and make mean that's, that seems like a co op. And it seems like some sort of a farm based CO-OP, right? Yeah. Bill each other's houses stay together. You don't have to wear sexy clothes. Let's just all wear the same shit. It's no big deal.

Speaker 2:          01:57:36       I love how you put that in it. You're right. So the inequality, the richest Dharmesh is as wealthy as the forest, but it's essentially as well, cause it's not like they're not holding them back. I think that's one of the things that I think about this in relation to attention is, so there's this theory that amish kids don't seem to develop Adhd, right? And there's been, it's been surprisingly understudied [inaudible] doctors. I mean that's the problem for kids are bouncing off the wall and he's adorable. I don't think it's that. I, I wondered if it was that and I would say about it if it was like they don't have electronics and then obviously I'm kidding. I don't think there's an element going on there. But actually the main thing is when I spoke to them they said, yeah, we've got some kids who don't want to concentrate and sit in school, but so we just let them run around and go fishing and hunting and state.

Speaker 2:          01:58:19       Right. And so many brands, right? So there's always going to be, there may be factors making it harder for us to concentrate in the environment. I think there are, but there's always going to be a natural variation in people who want to sit and focus on one thing compared to people who want to, you know, run around medically. And that's actually, you can see how as a species it benefits us to have both, right? But what we do is we try to bash every child into one particular mode of being, of course, actually is designed to prepare them for Shitty deadening work. The reason our schools are shitty and deadening does a, a guy called Alfie cone, he says every school has an official curriculum and a hidden curriculum. The official curriculum is like history, geography, whatever. And the hidden curriculum is, this is what we're training you to put up with in your life, right?

Speaker 2:          01:59:02       And if you've got a society where 87% of people don't like their work and you're more twice as likely, almost twice as likely to hate your job as love, your job, part of the job of the school system will be to deaden children. So they learn, you've got to fucking sit there and shut up and do what you're told, right? So that's not a malfunction of the system. That's an unconscious functions of the system, right? So we, we, we've got this system where we're bashing these kids to prepare them for this economic system that's making us feel miserable. To me, the solution is to change the way we work so we don't have to fucking dead and our children, right? So actually our children can be a bit, but the arm issue, who, you know, do as you say, it's not like they're doing high end cognitive labor is, will be the fancy way of putting it, right?

Speaker 2:          01:59:44       But the, the, the, their kids to them having a kid who goes fishing and running around, it's normal. It's as valuable actually as you may even be more valuable than the kid who sits there reading. Right? Because actually, so, um, I think there's a real thing about this, what that tells us, it comes back to one of the themes that's come up all through our conversation, Joe, these things that we're told our pathologies make sense in their contexts, right? Depression, we're told it's a pathology. Actually, anxiety with tides project actually is largely, not entirely, but largely a response to things going wrong. We're told addiction is a pathology. It's a response to things happening. We're told that obesity is a pathology. In some cases it's a response to things going wrong. We told the kids not wanting to be able to focus as a pathology in adults not being able to focus.

Speaker 2:          02:00:26       I think we need to understand that these things have meaning. They make sense, right? It doesn't mean they're good most, it's clearly not good to be a basis, clearly not good to be addicted obviously, but if you understand that they make sense. That opens up a totally different way of responding to them once that actually fucking work. Right. The places that I think about the drug war, right for chasing the scream by book about addiction and the drug war. I went out with a group of women in Arizona in that prison run by that fucking psychopath Joe Arpaio, who I also interviewed who trump pardoned. How the fuck did he pardon that guy?

Speaker 2:          02:01:02       Don't get me started on that. About this deeply. I, it's funny, I can tell you about Joe Arpaio cause a in a funny sort of way. I felt very sorry for him. But anyway, I went out on this group of, with this group of women who are made to go out on a chain gang wearing tee shirts saying I was a drug addict where members of the public mock them and jared them. Right. And I remember going back to the prison with them is called tent city. And the women were terrified is something called the hole, which is where you were sent if you fucked up. Right. And I said to the gods, we take me to see the whole, and I've been in a lot reporting from prisons and God's always

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       don't want to show you the bad things in this one cause it's a fucking pantomime of cruelty. They want you to see it. Right? So they took me to the hole. It was in fact a whole, it's a concrete cell, bare concrete cell with nothing in it, no TV, nothing. Um, and I saw this woman in there who was like, she saw my face through that was just so desperate to be a human being who wasn't one of these guards. She'd been there for a month. And I remember the audio is actually on the chasing the scream website. I'm chasing the scream.com and I remember looking in the cell and thinking, this is the closest you could get to a literal human reenactment of the cages that guaranteed addiction in rats. And this is what we're doing, thinking it will stop this woman from being addicted all the places which had approaches based on punishment and shame towards these things.

Speaker 1:          02:02:26       It's sometimes people say, Oh, punishing people with addiction problems doesn't work. That's way too soft on it. It makes the problem worse, right? Those women go in fucking broken, devastated, then they're even more broken and devastated. They go out even more fucking addicted. Right? So reason why Portugal has massively for portrait in Switzerland have massively falling addiction problems and the United States have massively increasing one's right. So to me, again, the evidence is approaches towards these problem that are based on compassion connection, uh, love, understanding, seeing that it makes sense work. They're not magic bullets. There's still gonna be problems in anything we do. And approach is based on shame and stigma and rage and just condemning people. Um, they just make the problem worse. Yeah. There's no doubt about that. And there's also no doubt about what you were speaking about when you started that rant about schools.

Speaker 1:          02:03:24       Yeah. About schools where children trying to fit them into these, these very convenient categories and trying to get them to get comfortable with doing things that they don't want to do that. That's great. If we're, we've resigned ourselves to turning children into work robots. I love that way of putting it. He just said, that's brilliant. Yeah. It shouldn't really ramping it. Oh look, I went through that myself. I thought it was a fool when I was in high school. I was like, there's gotta be something wrong with me. I can't concentrate. I can't do it. I'm never going to be good at anything. I was like, I'm just going to resign myself to be an outcast. I'm going to resign myself to be a loser because I just couldn't sit still in class. I couldn't pay attention. I didn't want to do the homework. I was bored out of my fucking mind and I didn't even realize there was anything that I could do that I would be intellectually curious about.

Speaker 1:          02:04:13       I mean, I just, I didn't think that that was a part of my life. I didn't think I was a curious person and it was just merely because I was being forced to do a bunch of shit that I didn't want to do and it tainted my idea of learning and when I got out of school and then when I started reading books just for my own amusement and an interest, then I realize, oh, I'm a very curious person. I just, I just didn't want to do what they wanted me to do. I didn't want to study what

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       they wanted me to study and I didn't want to be stuck in some room with some person who was under motivated and really didn't have any understanding of how to deal with children. It was the rare person, one out of five when I was six teachers that would come along that would give you like some spark of happiness and love and you'd go like, Oh, this class is pretty cool. That's a good teacher. Like Oh, she's nice, you know, he's fun. And it was rare. It was very rare. Most of the time it was a dull grind and I would wake up with nightmares after I'd graduated that I'd fucked up and didn't get the right amount of credits and I had to go back to school. I would have crazy nightmares that it would have to repeat the 12th grade and go back to school because I just, it was soul sucking.

Speaker 3:          02:05:19       And to me it represented the future because the future was going to be more soul sucking because you're going to be working 40 hours a week plus overtime doing something that you hated and this is what you had to do if you wanted to get by in this slide. And that is what was presented to me. And that's what's presented to a lot of people. And if you take that and keep going with it, you eventually become that guy who was in that job. And then you say, well, maybe I'll get some happiness if I get a nice car. And so you take out a lease on a nice car and then now you have this debt they have to pay. So now you have to keep working and you keep working. So you can keep this car. Well, I'm going to get a condo and then you get a Condo, you got more dead.

Speaker 3:          02:05:54       Then while I'm getting married, we're getting married. Well, we've got to take out a loan for the marriage because it's really expensive to get married and all. She wants a big wedding. And then you get a big wedding and a big ring and all this, and now you're fucking deep deep in the hall and now you have children. Oh Shit. And then you know, you're like, wow, I really don't want to be selling insurance anymore. I wish I coulda, I wish I could have been an artist. I wish I could have done this. I wish I could have pursued my interests. Well, it's kind of too late. You're 150 miles away from the neutral point, so you've got to go 150 miles back before you could start at zero.

Speaker 2:          02:06:24       I think he put us so well, and I'm just thinking about that the, this is the heart of my bit. Lots of connections is saying we don't have to have a human culture that deadens people, right? Yeah. We don't have to have a culture where people are controlled, dead end and isolated. That's not how most humans have ever lived. The Amish live much, far more human beings have lived in the way the amish live that have ever lived in the way we live. Now. I don't want to go fully back to the amish obviously, but, but there are lessons we can learn from all these things that we're talking about, about, about reconnection to meaning and purpose. And part of what you're saying is we, we live in a landscape that has been constructed not to serve people, but to serve corporations, right? This very unusual recent human innovation actually is.

Speaker 2:          02:07:03       I said, you know, imagine if every corporation was converted into democratic cooperatives. Imagine everyone listening to this tomorrow knew they were going into work in a place where if there is a boss, he's elected by them, he's accountable to them. Where you decide the priorities for your workplace, with your colleagues, by voting maybe once every three months, once a year, whatever. But the boss is accountable to you. That's a very different way of living and thinking about the things we do most of the time. And that would again require a vote for a school system that prepares people to be citizens taking part in a workplace, not are you put brilliantly like robot workers, you know, just passively receiving orders that requires a big systemic change. Now lots of people are making that transition. You know, like the people I talked about in a Baltimore bicycle works.

Speaker 2:          02:07:46       You've made that transition on their own. But these are, these are big social changes. We can make that the, and again, one of these that's so important is about saying to people like, it sounds to me like no one said to you, Joe, the fact that he fucking hate this school is a sign that you are more likely to be successful, not less, right. The things that will make you a success in your life are the things that this school is trying to be out of you right now. I'm just presuming, not literally be out of you, but mentally be you. Right. And in a sense that that's what we need to say to a lot of people about a lot of these forms of discomfort. It's not a sign of craziness. It makes perfect sense. You feel this way and you're right to feel this way.

Speaker 2:          02:08:25       I wonder if that's what's causing all these children to be on adderall and on, you know, all that. The various stimulants they put kids on, you know, uh, Prozac and all the different things that they do. A, it's literally because they're trapped in this thing and they can't do it and they can't do it. They can't do it. And it's just they can't concentrate. And so they give them something. Yeah. And they give them this pill and that pill turns him into a worker robot. And it's related to a lot of the things we've talked about as well. Increasing competition, for example. So parents are in such an unequal society. If you, if you have a society like Norway, where if a kid doesn't do well, they're going to have a good life. And if you could, does really well, they're going to have a good life.

Speaker 2:          02:09:01       Right. You know, there's less anxiety about, oh my kids falling behind. Yeah. If your kid falls behind, they can have a really fucking terrible like, yeah, right here too. But the counter that is rich kids don't do well at all. Miserable as hell. Yeah. I mean that's a real problem. A real problem with kids that don't have to do well. But I think this, this, you've got society that drugs, kids at the bottom to shut up these kids in foster care who are traumatized, not being looked after there being drug to just basically make them dose aisle. You've got kids at the top who are drug to make them compete. You know, I mean I've got a friend who's a Wall Street banker who, um, per his kid on, on, uh, uh, corrupt adderall originally one of the stimulant drugs when he was a young teenager cause he said, but every other fucking kid in the class is on it.

Speaker 2:          02:09:41       So if he doesn't go on it, he's falling behind. Um, so you have the, I mean, what a, what a sick culture is giving the children a cocaine like drug. Yeah. To make them compete in, in an unnatural way. And the fucked up part is it works. Yeah. Well essentially, so the research, and this is interesting, I think since the things worth pointing out, I'm worried about this in my book, but um, the actually there's evidence that um, kids develop tolerance to it over time, right. So actually initially it works really, really well and then gradually have to get higher and higher doses until eventually they, uh, there's a maximum limit it all day. And then, but then you have this real problem where actually if you then take the kid off it, they will experience really severe withdrawal. Right. And we'll often, what that's misinterpreted is, oh my God, look at what happens to my kid when I take him off.

Speaker 2:          02:10:29       And he goes, it's like, no, that's not the baseline of your kid. That's your kid in withdrawal from pain. Like remarkable. I mean I had a, I spoke about this before, so I think I can say I had a very close relative who had a cocaine addiction. And I remember at the height of her cocaine addiction, she had, uh, my neck, one of my, a young relative of mine that's friend's prices ambiguously. Who, um, she was drugging with Ritalin. The doctor given it cause he didn't want to focus cause he was traumatized because his mother was a cocaine addict. Right. And I remember she used to go drive into school in the morning. She would snort a line of coke before she went. And then in the car he'd have to swallow his cocaine, like pill. And I thought what a crazy culture that her cocaine use is illegal and would end up with, had been criminally punished and his cocaine lights substances required by the police.

Speaker 2:          02:11:19       You know, we required not required by the police are required by the school and mandated by the doctor. What a crazy, see what a culture that is fucked up about how it thinks about altering itself chemically about children, about connection and that and the, that my relative was very deprived. The capacity to understand what was happening to this is the coolest thing we've done. If you just give people these, these ridiculously simplistic stories about addiction, it's just the chemical hook or this ridiculously simplistic story about depression. It's just a chemical imbalance. It's like we say, you cut them off from understanding the thing that's right in front of them. And sometimes I think with, with both my books were chasing the scream and lost connections at times I thought, do I even need to say this? It's so fucking Banal, right? If you're lonely, if you're insecure, you're going to be, but actually he does need to be.

Speaker 2:          02:12:03       So when you say, when you say it's people, it's a very unusual position to be in a position where you were saying something that is both unbelievably obvious and really quite radical. Right. That's a weird, I can't think of managing it's common sense but it's not common. That's what got hungry by the time they're really is what it is. It's, it's not a common understanding. Now I want to get in to this, um, with you. What about the criticisms of your work and how have you, have you taken that in? If you debated anyone about your work? Cause I read quite a few things online, uh, that were very critical and I didn't agree with them. I didn't agree with what they were saying but I wanted to get your take on it. Sure. So there were a few things, few points that have been made.

Speaker 2:          02:12:45       Um, there were a few pieces that were written as soon as the book came out by psychiatrist who admitted that to be fair to the, hadn't read the book and they were responding to an extract from the book. And obviously in the next structure you can't make every point you want to make. Right? So is 100,000 what was the extract? What was the, so what I thought I was saying is even though the piece I think break clearly didn't say this is what they thought I was saying is chemical anti depressants are bad for everyone and people should stop taking them. If I had said that, it would be totally right to criticize me. That's not my position. My position. Easy way to criticize you just cherry pick and my position is, you know what we said before, chemical anti depressants give you a 1.8 points on the Hamilton scale, right?

Speaker 2:          02:13:23       That's not nothing. It's not much on average, but it's not nothing. Some people, like for example, one of my relatives, the one that we talked about who is trapped, she takes chemical antidepressants. I think she's right to take them right? She's got very limited margin change. She's not experiencing extreme side effects as lots of people do. I think she's right to caring for her at 1.8 points in a Hamilton scale is worth having. But it's not solving a problem, right? It's not solving the problem for the vast majority of people. And so I think there's been some criticisms that are, he's telling people to stop. That's a dangerous and terrible thing to do. Uh, so that's the most response to that is read the book. Cause I don't say that. If I to say explicitly, you should carry on taking them. If for you, the benefits outweigh the side effects.

Speaker 2:          02:14:07       Another criticism which I have more sympathy for in, I understand where it's coming from. It's not, is it's more like an ideological misunderstanding. Like we were saying, we live in such an individualistic culture. The, if someone comes along and it's, we basically think there's two ways of thinking about this, right? Either you, your depression and your anxiety, your addiction to due to a biological problem, in which case you deserve love and support. Or if you dismantle the biological story, what a lot of people hear is, Oh my God, you're saying it's my fault that I'm a fuck up, that I've got to solve this on my own. And lots of people turning around and going, well, I can't fucking go and democratize my workplace. I can't fucking go and you know, take a load of Iowaska and learn what they're just saying. What are you talking about?

Speaker 2:          02:14:52       And I think because I'm talking in this, this, this third category, which is biology is real, is real, but most of the drivers of this, our social, that in the way we live, because for so long we've been trained to not think in social terms. I think a lot of people just literally don't get what I'm saying, right? But when I was a kid, Margaret Thatcher said the premise at the time said, there's no such thing as society. There's only individuals and their families. Now, I never liked Margaret Thatcher, but this debate has made me realize how much I internalize that. Right? I was depressed that 13 years I'd fucking studied social sciences. Right? It never even occurred to me. There was a societal component to how bad I felt. Right? So I was kind of like a thatcherite to my own pain and distress. Do you see what I mean?

Speaker 2:          02:15:37       And I think we've, so we've so individualized and internally we start internalize this individualism. The, I think people are understanding. Again, they were riffing on the extracts. These are not people who've read the book in the main, but I think it was kind of understandable for them to be like, fuck you, I can't do that. You know, I can see why they're saying that I'm not. So I wouldn't push back on them so hard because think, well, there are narrow margins and this is why we need to check. And people get that. If you talk about car accidents, right? We individual drivers should drive safely. Um, but we don't just leave car safety up to that. We have airbags and seat belts and speed limits. Driving tests were dry arrest people under Duis, right? If we just took away all those things and just said to individual drivers, hey, drivers and pedestrians, pedestrians take care of drivers, take care, we would have far more people dying in car accidents than we do now.

Speaker 2:          02:16:29       Right? So we accept that there's individual, an individual role, but there's a social role, right? The whole society deals with the problem of car accidents and what I'm saying is the whole society should deal with the problem with depression and anxiety. We need social changes like democratizing workplaces is one we've talked about a lot that reduced the reasons why people are so depressed and anxious in the first place, but I think in a society that is so devalued, the idea of the social, it's just I may as well be speaking fucking Swedish where they could understand it. What is it? You see what I mean?

Speaker 3:          02:16:55       I think they're just neglecting to consider the possibility that some of the factors are because of your life and and the the social aspects, the physical aspects, the exercise, the Diet, all those various things. There's many, many people that do certain neglecting to take those even into consideration. I also think people work way too much. I don't think that's the way to live your life. I think we've got a really bad system and I think the system has existed for so long that we assume that this is the only way to live, that you have to do a 40 hour work week. I think it's ridiculous. I think we should work maybe four days a week and it might be three. We might, we may be, people would be more productive. They kicked ass for three days a week and then had a fun time for, for, you know, maybe, maybe it's like one on one off, one on one off, one on one off.

Speaker 3:          02:17:43       Maybe it's like that. And just that's the way we live life. Like have a fucking work day and have a day where you don't work. Have you choose to live to work more because you know you're trying to pursue something and you're a dedicated person. You have a job. That's one thing. But I just think this soul sucking grind of, you know, getting out of college 21 and grinding until you're 65 and the new look forward to your golden years. You're dying motherfucker. There's no golden years. That's all horse shit you, you know, you watch it on golden pond too many times, you're not going to make it. The only bad example, he hit his daughter,

Speaker 2:          02:18:18       maybe the golden girls movie is a really shit feel much epilepsy please. She's like, I'll wash it for the first time. I played recently by, there was another thing going on. There's another thing going on. I had to make sure I that miss my flight, but there's nothing going on, which is what we've done is we've told people the path out of stigma is to say that the problem is just biological. Right? Right. So we said people, you should not be criticized for having an imbalance. We even more than that, it's like having a pancreas disease. We just need to give you a medication. Exactly. We've told people you should not be judged for your depression, anxiety, addiction because it's a biological problem. I entirely agree. Obviously people should not be judged for their anxiety, depression or addiction, but actually it's a really interesting experiment.

Speaker 2:          02:19:00       They show you that this is just a complete Monday's first trigger me and this is I to be an amazing neuroscientists call Mark Lewis, who I was talking about this and I said, you know, I'm worried cause you explaining a lot of the things we've talked about to me early in my research. And I said, you know, I'm worried about this mark, because won't this just reintroduced stigma, right? If we're saying it's not just biological. And he said, yeah. Did anyone ever doubt but leprosy or AIDS were biological problems? Right? Right. Literally nobody ever doubted that. Zero. You might have noticed there was some stigma against leprosy and aids. Why do you think saying something is biological removes the stigma around it? I thought I say it again. It's a simple point. The wow, I'd never thought of that. But there's actually an experiment by women I interviewed called a Professor Sheila matter, which looked at this question of stigma.

Speaker 2:          02:19:42       She, so she wanted to pick her out, which is more de stigmatizing, telling people, uh, that, that mental health problems are caused by your biology or saying that caused by your life. It's what they do is it's a little bit of a complex experiment. I think it's worth explaining. Say you're the guy who's taking part in the experiment. They bring you in and they say, before the experiment begins, we just want you to sit here and fill in a questionnaire, right? This is you don't realize, but this is actually the experiment. It's you're sitting next to someone else who you don't realize as an actor and you get chatting and the actable sup. They'll run it two ways. Sometimes the actor will say, I've got a mental health problem because of my biology, and sometimes he'll say, I've got a mental health problem because of bad things that have happened to me.

Speaker 2:          02:20:25       Right? Then you told the experiments beginning come through to this room and you're told you joe have got to teach this other person. The person you don't realize as an actor a pattern. It's like a patent on a computer is we're testing how well people learn patterns and every once you've taught it to him, every time he gets it wrong, I want you to push this button and this button, we'll give him a short sharp electric shock, right? Won't kill him or anything. It's not going to fuck him up, but it, it's uncomfortable. Right? And they wanted to see would there be a difference in how many electric shocks and how hard you hit hit the button, depending on what you were told, what they found was you were significantly more like you zapped the person more and harder if you thought that the problem is just due to their biology than if it was due to things that happened to them in their lives.

Speaker 2:          02:21:08       And I think that's because I think this is the stuff we're talking about is the part that stigma because what it says, if what we're saying is this just this class of people who are biologically different to us and they have this floor that you and I don't have, um, you can see why that leads to stigma, right? But if what you're saying is actually we're all uniquely, we're all vulnerable to this stuff. I'm actually the things that are making some people depressed, anxious, and addicted and making loads of us just less happy than we could be less fulfilled than we could be. What that does, instead of making dividing us into two tribes, it says we're all on a continuum, and actually the fight that will help these people who are depressed and anxious will also improve your life. Right. That's to me a much more powerful message.

Speaker 2:          02:21:49       It's solving a problem, being an inexplicably biological malfunction. It's a response to things that you can see in your life. Right. Well, it's interesting that we've always had the term sadness, right? People have always experienced sadness, but if you go back and go through ancient literature, you don't see a lot of stories about people suffering from depression. That's a relatively new distinction. You did get people who talk about melon Melancholia. Yeah, sure. Do you think depression has always the, the state's been acute and extreme unhappiness. Always been people living on happy lives, but the state being depressed

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       as being a clinical, psychological sort of a diagnosis that's relatively recent. Well, the idea that it's a pathology and it's probably coming up to, I was thinking, but this way you were speaking earlier. Um, we do, when we talk about food, that's the thing of it is you can tell him what was that British when I first came to the, the u s I never remember, I remember the first time someone ever offered me an indigestion pill, which they don't exist. Ingestion pill that you can buy them in, like, like pepto Bismol or something like that. Right. And I meant that just saying, but, but wait, indigestion is a sign from your body. You're eating too fast. You don't want to, you don't want to get rid of that signal. You'll, you'll, you'll eat too much or hurt yourself. Right. That, that's, that's not a malfunction. That's, that's a function. Right? Right.

Speaker 1:          02:23:15       What about that? You know, that the, it comes back to so many things we're saying, the things, the feelings that we have of distress are not malfunctions. That telling us something is missing in the environment, in the psychology, in our lives. They're not fuck ups with as a signal industry that they, they, they benefit from feeling that void. Like if you've got an issue, they've got a pill for it and as soon as you create that sort of an an environment, they're going to constantly be innovating and trying to come up with new pills for new issues and even create ailments, makeup ailments and come up with solutions for those ailments. And a lot of those are actually, we've, we've shown this on the podcast many times. Those were done by advertising agencies. They've actually created names of diseases and issues just so they can come up with solutions.

Speaker 1:          02:24:04       One of the things that was most shocking in the research, but the loss connections was realizing how much of what I had been told was invented, not by scientists but by drug company PRS. So it, I'll give you an example, two examples that print, I'm going to have to go in and set. No worries. Um, what got you one other interview before my flight. So fuck that interview. Sorry. The uh, the, there's this so everyone knows, if you think about taking selfies, right? You take 30, 30 selfies, you throw away 29 and you only used the one that can't do that. Don't be a bitch. Take a selfie and go with it. It's like deniro in the deer hunter, one bullet, the three that you already have. You know, you use the one where you look good, right? Turns out in the whole process when, um, antidepressants were first being marketed to us, they basically did that with scientific studies. What they did is they, they, they would commission a hundred studies. Uh, 90 of them would say mixed results or poor results. Those all got put in the trashcan. And the only, the ones where, I mean, there's one study I cite in the book, I think it was, they tested the drug on 247 people and they only published the results for 27 of them, who you will not find it hard to guess where the 27 for whom it, right. So the early

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       results were hugely exaggerated. You'll remember that when antidepressants were first marketed, people are told, you know, it'll make you better than well, right? No one says that. Now you'll notice that stuff's all gone away, right? It doesn't happen anymore. Um, so there's this huge, actually Eliot Spitzer did an amazing job when he was attorney general in New York state. I've taken the pharmaceutical companies to, to court because it's particularly affected me when I read it because it was the drug that I was given as a teenager. It's, um, called paroxetine or Paxil in the u s um, that the, the company that manufacturers, it literally had a leaked memo from them in which they say this doesn't work for teenagers, but that I think the phrase they used was this would be unacceptable for the commercial profile of paroxetine. So they just said that it did and that's the fucking drug I was given.

Speaker 2:          02:26:06       Right. It's shocking to see the drug that you were given the, this company involved. So it didn't work for people like you. Right, right. Um, and, and, and you know, when it had very powerful side effects on me, I gained a huge amount of way. It has all sorts of side effects. Um, the, did it help you at all? I thought a strong initial boost and I would say it probably did give me 1.8 points on the Hamilton scale. Like what we're talking about probably gave me a very mild boost, but it didn't solve my problem. And the problem is the story I was told about it, that this is the solution because the problem is the chemical imbalance disconnected me from a much wider program of reconnection in my life that did in fact solve my depression when I embarked on it. Right. The, the so, so I think the, the drug companies, it's scandalous what they did.

Speaker 2:          02:26:55       It's not that the drugs have no value, they do, but when you read through what they actually did and the way the stories were constructed, um, and the, the, the, the, the bullshit we were told, you know, I mean I remember it just being a clinical psychologist talk to Lucy Johnson and he's a brilliant person and her just saying, you know, everything you were told is bullshit. And me just sitting there and going through this is what my daughter told me. This is what my doctor told me. This isn't my daughter. She's the fact that shit bullshit cautions, no legal repercussions against those people for doing that. It's just stunning. I mean there was something about what you think about like insider trading, how devastating the penalties are for that. This is far worse. One of the scandals is the um, the FDA, how much of it is funded by the drug companies itself?

Speaker 2:          02:27:40       Right. 40% of the budget. I mean, imagine if you had a ballgame where one side was fun, where one of the teams paid the referees wages. Right? Right. I think you'd find that gate that, that that team would win a lot more often. All right, so what we think is, oh, there's this dispassionate judge, the, and one of those scans. Even the way the rules are constructed. So to get a drug, and I think there would have been slightly tightened recently, but the t one entity presence were first introduced to get a drug to market. You only had to demonstrate to studies anywhere that shows any efficacy. Right? So that means you could commission 3000 studies and if two of them, it's not that the FDA would take the balance of the research, if you could show to that it works. That's what they represent those studies to the FDA.

Speaker 2:          02:28:24       They didn't have to show them everything they've done. Exactly. It's gotten a bit better now. There's now more publication required, which is one of the reasons why so few new chemical antidepressants are coming onto the market because the rules have been slightly tightened. And as a result where all the new ones, they're not coming on, you know, the, I mean there are some, but they're far more limited. How has he shown also that rigorous exercise is actually more effective in treating depression than antidepressants? I think I was going a bit too far, but there's evidence that while there's very strong, if it's taught to Isabelle banker who you should, you would love, I should introduce you to her. She's a primatologist Chilean primatologist, basically the best person in the world as far as can said. She's a hardcore chalea and she's currently in some jungle somewhere better than Mick Jagger's ex wife.

Speaker 2:          02:29:01       Uh, yeah, yeah. I mean, I like Marianne Faithfull, but Isabel as something else. Right. So it's about ultimately is my last point, but Isabelle, so she's demonstrated, she showing loads of things. One of the real interesting things is, um, nature, so she's shown that exercise is a massive, really powerful anti depressant. But interestingly, exercise in nature is even more effective. And she's shown her theories. And I really liked this. She, she did a lot of work with Bonobos, both in zoos and in the wild. And she's got really good stories about how Benobos basically bond by lesbian group sex. And she, she, she, she's had a pioneer how they managed to create vibrators when they're in the zoo. It's an amazing story, but the, uh, like literally she would like get the buckets and they would find a way to turn it into a vibrator. She was more of them, right?

Speaker 2:          02:29:47       And then have massive lesbian origins with their vibrators, British Zeus, and he's like polite British parents would be like, what's happening? And they'd be like, come over here. But the is the most theories. So animals go crazy and zoos a lot of the time, right? Carrots rip out their feathers, horses start obsessively swaying. Elephants will grind their tasks down to nothing. Um, uh, and, and she basically argues is [inaudible] Bob, this is simplifying your argument. She has as many things going on here. But um, the, the, the humans are being animals deprived of their habitat feel like shit. And we are increasingly deprived of our habitat. The habitat we evolved in, right? There's lots of evidence that people who live in areas with no green space, I'm much more likely to become depressed than people who don't. And people who move from one area without greenspace torn area, we greenspace become much less depressed, rise loads of research on this.

Speaker 2:          02:30:39       There was actually an amazing study. Michigan State Prison looks out by just by accident, no one designed it this way. One part of it looks out over just bare concrete and one part of it looks out over like lovely green space and the people who when the, there was just random where you ended up, but the people who looked out over the concrete, we're 23% more likely to develop mental health problems, right? So this thing about as Isabel says, we are animals that were designed to move through nature. If you are not an animal moving through nature, you are not a healthy human being. You are not in your habitat, you need to be in that habitat at least some of the time. Right. And um, yeah, I, she's got by has the best stories I've asked that you should do. You should, you would love her anyway.

Speaker 2:          02:31:22       She, I'm sure she has both lesbian group sex stories and stories about how you can kill your depression with nature exposures though y'all aren't. Thank you very much in one more time. The name of your book. So the book is called lost connections, uncovering the real causes of depression and the unexpected solutions. If you go to the book's website, www.thelostconnections.com you can find out what loads of people from Hillary Clinton to Tucker Carlson to Ellis Elton John had said about the book. You can take a quiz to see how much you know about depression and anxiety. And the book has a facebook page, it's facebook.com/the lost connections. And the other book we talked about is chasing the scream just about addiction. Or you can find out more about that at www dot chasing the scream. Scream as an ally. Like Jen, Jamie Lee, curtis, and halloween.com. Okay. Thank you very much. I really do their job really so much. That was fantastic. Cheers. All right. I really enjoyed that. [inaudible] we're going to the proper little bit. Didn't way.
