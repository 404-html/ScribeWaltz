That was pretty close that Donald trump will be 70 years old and six days. So it is seven months in, six days. Seven months. Seven year olds, 70 years old. Seven months in, six days. Almost seven year old years old. Seven months and seven days when he becomes the president. And he won by 77 electoral votes from seven electors. Wow.

Are One time we're talking about how we were in a simulation theory and how everything's made out of ones and Zeros and I said something like, I'm going to hack it. I'm ready to start saying sevens or some. I can't even remember what it was, but it's all from that. So this is your shirt that has all sevens. It's. Yeah, it's made from sevens.

Speaker 1:          01:50          It is a whole. It's just a bunch of different color sevens. Yeah. To make the artwork.

Speaker 2:          01:55          And this sweatshirts the desk squad seven slash 11 shirt

Speaker 1:          01:58          episode seven, seven seven. So I thought it had to be you because of all the, your seven references that you threw in all throughout the years at number haunts me. So bad. Why? I don't know. It just comes up so much now. Okay, sure. I have a seven on my shirt. Do you? Uh, I dunno, I might. I don't give a fuck. How about that?

Yeah, I guess, but I mean Zika babies grow up to be pretty smart. Nope, we haven't had any. That's true. Actually. It hasn't grown up. I really. I don't think so. I mean, not that I've ever heard of. I just made that up. I think there's actually adult Zika babies. I think so because I was thinking about making Zika hats for Zika people, so it makes it look like their heads are bigger.

Speaker 1:          02:55          The whole key is to get somebody who spars with you. That's not trying to hurt you, but it's just trying to grow with you and learn. That's so hard because egos get involved late. George would never hurt you. What? Boy? George. Who would never heard you? Oh, sorry. All right. That's it. Where else we're going to go? No, that looks like he's fully hard to deck guys. Giant. It's a giant Dick. Come on son. You know that Shit's real. You want it to be real. No, I'm scared. She that could just be.

Speaker 1:          04:35          world. Somebody figured out a way to distribute information through fucking pipes and a numbers. It's decoded back into letters, ones and Zeros and this would have came to Hashtag Dick Games. Drawing. You just be dealing with people with problems all the time. I don't think that's a good idea. Just make your dicks off. That's why. Is that do it? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:58          Yeah. When someone tells you their problems, I always feel like if you tell me your problems, you're making my Dick's off problems make you dig south. I've never. Well, I always felt like that when I was dating, you know, it's like, oh, the girl, she starts telling your problems, you're like, man, you making them

Speaker 1:          05:15          ticks off. Cheer Up, boy. Fuck. What'd you think of him? I loved. Yeah. I forgive him for dancing in the street in the street with him and Mick Jagger, Chicago. I've been to forgive them. I forgive them for arguably the most confusing sexually, at least to a young man. I'm like, what is happening? What's going on with my. What's that? About why they freeze frame on that. But is that you? Did you do that Jamie? Or is that the actual video? That's how it ends. That's unfortunate

Speaker 3:          05:45          when you go to whatever his boxing or UFC, the undercard no one's there. They're all out getting drinks and waiting for the thing that they don't understand to happen. That's at the end. So

Speaker 2:          05:58          it's dead silent. Bingo Hall Church. Silence. So you can heckle from the back row. But Joe Rogan good as second row, so it's absolutely quiet and we're in their heckling. Let me take your fucking him in the ass. No, no, no, no. Let me take it for granted because I wasn't heckling at all because Douglas doesn't do marijuana. Joseph does marijuana. Douglas does alcohol. Joseph does marijuana. Joseph's freaking out because Douglas is heckling them on your ticket and I'm fucking laugh. Or you're the one who brought me in. So I'm kind of your responsibility. Yeah, try making him come. That always knocks me out like a light. I've been baking bread lately. Holy Shit. Sourdough bread. Sourdough bread is very good for you. It is. Has Gluten though? No, I can't even ice skate.

Uh, Joe Rogan. I promise you because I watched it and I was like. So he was with Eddie? Yeah. No, nope. He was. No, I'm 100 percent certain. Well, I fight that Google's right. Nope. I a 100 percent certain. Eddie Wong came in one time with the guy that was in that movie of the interview. I'm going to go to the mat on this one. I'm looking at it right now and you're wrong. I'm really laid down on the Internet, not backing me up with this boy toy thing. And I started. It looks like I'm pretty sure he's right. He's not right. He's right,

Speaker 4:          07:53          right?

Speaker 2:          07:55          Is that racist? Racist. It's just a gong. Can we get away with a gong for anybody gets mad at me? David Cho or that you're thinking of? No, it's Roy Choi. Burt. Roy Choi was an episode of getting Doug with high with Horacio Sands. Uh, Hiroshi CEO and me have often been confused way. Yes. Yes you are. Are you serious? You know it happens. It's no big deal. Burt wanted a minute. Look at me. Very competitive. Very competitive. Getting Doug with high effective dose is 20. And what does he pop? Pop to? Two hundred and effective drawing over. Fuck Cap.

Speaker 5:          08:57          no idea how insanely bed at night. Like a baby. I put that basket on. I sleep like a fucking baby,

Speaker 6:          09:04          so it was just joey, myself and the driver and we get in the car. There's no music on. We're just talking and we just hit one of those moments, you know when you're on a highway at night and you kind of hit that thing where it's like you just. Everyone stopped talking for a minute and you're looking out the window and you can feel like I'm just kind of staring off. No one's talking. And then after like 15 seconds of silence, Julia goes, that will tell you. By the time I saw a guy cut open at the tenderloin in 1979, stomach split wide open. And I was like, what? And I just see the driver's eyes widen. And I was like, no. He goes, yeah, it's blood was brown because he was bleeding for so long. People just stepped over him and I saw two guys stab each other. Fucking street, 1980, just over. Nothing. They just stab each other. I didn't almost shit my pants, but then I got used to it. And then you just see the driver

Speaker 5:          10:01          like he can. He can add in. Oh Jesus Christ. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Fucking Christ Jesus. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Fucking Christ. Oh my God. Oh my God. Jesus. This is fucking tremendous. Liquidity them again. This is hard against broken down like, oh, Jesus, control. Oh yeah, but he doesn't know where he is. He doesn't know where he is. He doesn't know. He doesn't know he is. This is hard against fucking cocksuckers. I've been waiting for this bucket fight for three fucking months. This is what I'm talking about. This is what the fucking problem is. Okay? You went to the body. Every once in awhile, you run into a fucking wall. This Guy Diaz the fuck. Are these people looking at shit. You gotta kill this motherfucker. Get over. There's a new one. 50 five West. Got Him now. Where's the Gregor? Now this catch Philadelphia. You know motherfuckers, Eddie Alvarez, this is crazy. I told you this is the fight in a bucket year. You fucking Momo totally sharp with your bullshit. Brock Lesnar and mark fucking art stuff compared to this goddamn use. God Damn Eddie Alvarez. I told you I was excited when you called me. This is the fucking fighting cock suckers. Holy Shit. Eddie Alvarez. She says, I gotta manage it. Attack. He looks fantastic. That's what I'm fucking talking about. So I say, Joe, I say to him, Joey, how'd you get into podcasts? And his response, you know Chael Sonnen, he wanted me to jail.

Speaker 2:          11:54          It was always, you know what is calls me Joe Rogan. I'm mugged a hooker down in New Jersey and senator Lee said her wig on fire. It's like, okay, we got to. There's two moving parts here. First off, that is, I don't know how that answers my question of how, but now I need to know the story here. So he ties it all together with. He went on something, just something. He got an appearance. He told the story of Mug and a hooker in New Jersey and setting her wig on fire and all of a sudden he blew up overnight and he goes, yeah. I realized people like the stores. I never knew that I had stories from the part of the country I'm in and the neighborhood I grew up in. I thought everybody had these doors. He's like, chill center, and I thought I'd tell you I mogul hooker and lighter, wiggling fire. You Go, yeah, well I'm moved 10 hookers and let 10 wigs on fire. I was like, I didn't know I had stories.

Speaker 5:          12:38          Well in that way it's a swap meet in Jersey. They called, what do they call the market? Something like that. I was a kid. I used to go to where the use to do the bicycles, whatever those street car races and next door to it. They had what was called and you'd go there and they had pretty much shit that was stolen. It was just a festival and they tries to a table fee because everything was 50 percent off. Even the sneakers I remember and then we found that that the guy would go to the fucking factory and jump over the fence and take over the sneakers, no mistakes, so the irregulars he, they would take those and just sell them at those markets. Swap meets and then we find that we cut into his action. I just want it gone. We, we, we cut into that action and the MANACA action, they're not going to. Those tubes have been knocked. Best Prank. They would throw thousands of them out with little things like the chemical was off. You start blinking too much, like the chemical. Then it was pepper spray, pepper spray, like people would spray and you can see what happened. It's not regular binocular. What does that tear gas. It was like the tickets.

Speaker 5:          13:56          The Spanish kid that was advertised and we make them jump the fence and we'd have thousands of tubes a and we'd sell them for fifty cents a piece on Monday, the sixth and seventh grade or virus, but there was always three kids that complain. There was like the chemical imbalances or facebook friends with me from high school and Pussy wouldn't get wet. He used to call the dry hump, the jersey, they used to call her insurance. Either said she had some type of Vd, so they called the lorry Jack. She's got the Jack, the Jack Jack. Jack said he used to call her name and Jack like that was like, they just at this girl, oh my God, I got a score, got coke, she's got money. I'm going to fuck her. I'm excited. We go back to a hotel. We finally registered like $30. They asked us through one of the Jacuzzi in the room and shit.

Speaker 5:          15:02          It was one of those dirty hotels on totally as you going to New York City. We went in there, we walked in and she goes, rule number one, you are not going to find me. It's five in the morning. That goes, my fucking. That goes this night and all of a sudden she looks at me. She goes, well, if you could guess the color of my panties, I fuck you. I'm like, okay, read. And she goes, they're green, but good enough. We started snorting coke, mass. I mean it was filthy. I woke up at five in the afternoon and Doug flutie was thrown that quarterback that down down 83. I was waking up. She was naked. Rip Apart.

Speaker 2:          15:41          Fuck stretches. Pain. Now it's fucking is killer. I mean, music is so hard to pin down. It's funny too because you know, we had a bit of a. We had a falling out recently and you couldn't find a bigger stars will faint to me. I just listened to his record on the way over here and it's a fucking masterpiece, but he also won't fucking talk to me right now. What happened? Well, here's the thing I don't even mind talking about, right? I in an interview, I said that he was, and this is honestly what I believe, I think he is. And you're going to laugh when I say it, but I swear this is what I fucking believe. I think he's a paid ass and I'll just let that sink in for a second. I think he's taken motherfuckers out

Speaker 5:          16:29          and they got this farm and they had these horses. There was over 100 hours of footage of these people getting fucked by animals and one guy, they type it though. There's a video of it. You could watch it. You want to see absolutely.

Speaker 7:          16:44          Look, things go wrong all the time. You can crawl up on the couch, you can declare yourself a victim, you can give up or you can recognize that that's just part of life and wake up the next day with a smile on your face and continue to move forward and just do your best. I've told, I've told the truth. Uh, I think it's really hard to do any damage to somebody who's willing to tell the truth regardless of the consequences. And then I admit mistakes. I think mistakes have a way of. So compounding themselves just because people don't acknowledge those mistakes. So given this pitch, all I want to do is just get in the polls that determines who is in the presidential debates. I think that if I'm in the presidential debates, I have an opportunity of actually winning because of

Speaker 2:          17:37          this

Speaker 7:          17:37          package that you've allowed me to present here today ago. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          17:41          That's why the bad girls club show is the greatest single and TV that. Oh, put a brick up a trailer for it. If you're listening is going to be good.

Speaker 1:          17:50          They just get. They get like we talked about this piece of garbage and then they just fucking make them drink and stuff. I'm going a goddamn house for three for three months and it's, it's they have to go to the hospital for the fights fights they've had this year particularly. It goes, I'm over there trying to twerk in. This bitch is like, you know, she tried to work next to me. She was right in my workspace and it's like bitch can't talk like me. You shouldn't even be on the same level. And then it's like having fights like adults face. He goes, bitch, because you ain't on my work level. That's why I'm up in your face because you ain't on my work level.

Speaker 6:          18:30          Tom Cruise. He like a traveling king, you know, like he's got many, many trailers like and like so like you know, you arrive in a situation, you think, right. Era, my prejudices about Tom Cruise, all the things I've read, all the things I've heard go prejudice. Like we meet him, he blasted me. We've searched affability and charm that they melt it away. Ice cones. Then the pure heat of the man sweetness. You gave a lock on the sofa. It was my birthday. During that film I got a big basket full of blight, yoga related things and stuff like that. At least sort of for, for president. You remember, you know, shake your hand. Remembers your name, sort of remembers details about aids. I could bring. You mentioned you're on a or something in that conversation. Next conversation. You mentioned that on a one man his ass for 10 hours really, really late because of that fucking monkey.

Speaker 6:          19:13          Actually it was playing up like he was not working that day. I went back, went mandy's affidavit, said when he'd been married, Katie Holmes, and it was that little ms dot Tom Cruise. Siri Cruz was, they're all lined up. I went there. I was very, very late and they'd like they to wheat and goes, oh, well, do you want to stay away? I mean, yeah, yeah. I will wait and I had to sat. I'm sat with you now. Joe Opposite Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes and the little dial in one. I was fucking eating spaghetti and it's as a complicated thing to eat.

Speaker 1:          19:42          He's long isn't it?

Speaker 6:          19:44          The lady and the tramp shoving that shit in and then the next course I think was the signer, which was weird because that's to pass the courses. Then I think there was like sort of cupcakes and stuff involved

Speaker 1:          19:53          all the way through. It just sat opposite. Tom Cruise talking about communism, which I brought up as a topic, which in retrospect was a mistake. Why? Well, because don't bring up communism or let me ask you this. I've got to pop it in the spring. Bottled water. I just wanted to dig out Bro. Guess how much. Not Small enough for that. Don't piss all over my floor in here. Yeah, you can do it in there. Just just corn hole that we have to go soon anyway because I to get something. Me Put the Cameron Nearest Dick or were the first folks. That's the first time anybody's peed on the pocket. Don't take a photo of his dick. It's blocked by the cup. If you guys taking a photo of your dick, Bro, that's a full Kombucha. Definitely don't drink that. You're going to piss in the pickles too, bro. How'd you cut off stream for sure. You're dribbling on my carpet? No, I fully, fully, fully this cock. Jamie pulled up to the fucking definition. Is this an urban dictionary? This is a better definition,

Speaker 2:          20:48          I think that no one you gave. Oh, how dare you. Hey, demasculated millennial, liberal male who often speaks of white privilege and modern feminism, blames white men for all of the world's problems. The new definition or. I like this though. There goes chat again with the megaphone telling everyone that he's a Vegan. What a cook. Okay. I like that. Did you. Do you

Speaker 8:          21:13          stay in any way in touch with those kids from back in the day from the kids that bullied you? Did you ever. It was actually funny after the ultimate fighter, um, I got invited out by one of the guys, um, and uh, just because I think a couple of people will just, yeah, saw one of the guys who was one of the main guys and he's like, Hey, I'm walking around downtown Fort Worth and said, why don't we go out here, whatever. I'm like, all right, I'll go. And. Well, he had actually brought me into a Sushi restaurant in all around the table was most of the people that were not most is probably only like eight or 10 people, but they were some of the main kids that were at that party when I dressed up and everything. Man, if you, if we'd have known you were a fighter or could've kicked their butts and we wouldn't have done that to you. And I'm just like, it's. So I told him I was going to the bathroom just left. Um, I think that's the only time I've ever done anything like that, but I'm just like, I can't, I can't be around these guys.

Speaker 2:          22:09          And I don't think we should talk about trump for a long time, but. But that's, he's got a lot of charisma. Say what you want to love the guy. He's got a ton of charisma and that's weird. Kind of charisma. Yeah. He's got like this mean guy charisma. You want him to like you. So you say things like you don't even believe. Yeah. Because you want him to like think that you're on his side so we won't come after you. Yeah. That's a bully charisma. That's absolutely right. But it's charisma nonetheless. That's the. And that's the thing about stars and movie stars and stuff like that. It's like you're watching this guy, you watch denzel Washington waiting for him to snap. He never does. But your weight, you can tell he's Gunna, he just doesn't. It's like Robert Downey Jr. I feel like with robert downey jr. You're watchIng a guy not do cocaine.

Speaker 2:          22:58          Yeah. He wants to do everything in him, wants to do cocaine. So you're watching a guy not actively, not do cocaine from second to second. That's such a good analysis. Yeah. That you're just trying. You're just watching this guy, this thing, this car accident that never happens. I know somebody to talk to a cop and they said that when he started working and then 11 years later. Oh yeah. Going into those areas where these things always happen and after years and years it just, it just wears on you for sure. Know from the aiR. This is me growing up in situations, you know what I mean? I wouldn't want to go back. I barely go back there, you know, so. But it Do give you nerves. You'll nerves heightened in naturally kicks. Oh, 100 percent, you know, and like, yeah, some people can't handle those nerves. You learn how to breathe quietly.

Speaker 2:          23:52          You don't know like somebody, you could walk down the street and somebody could pull a pistol out on those things though. I've been driving down the street with my ex lady and she was talking and I was like, get down because I saw a guy draw on a corner and shoot across the street at another guy that's the gun went up. We drove under the, the, the, the fire. Right. But it was long, it was long. Oh my god. And then they went up, we went under the second shot off and I drove and I was like, man, that was crazy. Like I'm that guy. She laid it out, we made that was crazy. And she was like, you didn't call the police. And I was like, well, what is he like to tell what happened? And I was like, I don't want to be. And that's how crazy it is that you don't even want to be involved because you got to go to the cops and I end up calling the police and um, things like he described the victim. I was like, white t shirt, blue Jeans, that's all I said. And that it was like, was he black? And it was just a long pause. It was a long poles and they like sarah is he black? And I was like, man, you know, that nick was black

Speaker 6:          25:03          men do that all. I have several of those in my own, not nuclear family but my family of procreation. So might fruit. I won't saY who, but brutal. Right. And, and here's another thing that you never admit that you're wrong, right, because admitting that you're wrong makes you lose face. And that's such a detrimental dynamic to have, right? I mean, you know, I might come home at night and um, I've had a tough day and I might respond correctly to my dog. I actually will go back and then hug my dog because I have enough self awareness to realize that I didn't give her enough attention. Right? So I have enough humilitY to, nevermind, you know, another human. My dog is just as important to me. And if I responded curtly, I will sort of apologized to Her. Yet I've got family members, uh, again, this is not my family of my wife or kids, but the family that I was born into that have never apologized about anything because they come from a cultural landscape where to apologize to your child, to somebody younger is to lose face at parent is always right. And I mean that might work when you're too, but when you're both now adults, I think you sort of have to get out of that and realized that we all make mistakes and we all have to own up to them. Like I want to see me get beat the fuck up. Just jamie. Jamie shown a video of me about to get my ass kicked by nick diaz

Speaker 9:          26:25          are you get destroyed really fast. I would imagine if the game is realistic, fill it up and I get fucked up. People want to say it. But they might have used the ceo's secret character. They might have. You got some bullshit skills. Might have you juiced up. I got it. Doesn't matter. I got some bullshit with. Let's hear mike because you know I'm super casual fan. So my commentary. No. Rather with the leg kick. I've never heard this before. Oh. Oh, we're all good with the leg kicks. Rogan get kicked in the face. Oh good. With the kicks. Diaz is back it up. Rogan missed. oh really? Kicked in the chest. Tattoos. Accurate. Look at that.

Speaker 10:         27:02          And a lot of scientology training in terms of what it imparts to people is a quality of being, direct, being assertive, being confident, being in charge, and being okay with sort of dominating the situations that you're in. It'S one of the reasons that I think it appeals a lot to act as because it, it, it, it works, I think for people who have any sort of insecurity or who are going into situations of uncertainty and it allows you to almost reprogrammed your circuits in some way and be okay about using assertive body language and speech and it also imparts a sense that you have all the truett's necessary to save humanity from itself. Not just humanity on earth, but throughout time and space, and it is your obligation to ensure that those truths are saved, saved for posterity, and communicated as widely as possible in a totally unadulterated fashion because any adulteration of the message means that not only do they not work, they become toxic and dangerous. Is it good? Good.

Speaker 1:          28:05          I like it. Let me try something that give it a go. What do you do with it? Take a little bump. Put it under your lip bump. Little pinch cocaine style bump. Now we've never done that either. I'd go less and less asked. Plenty for you. Is that too much? that's good. Okay. Where do you put it? Anywhere you put any love you want, it's start to burn a little cranky. Cancer or immediately? I don't think so. I mean now you shouldn't. I get messages every day from people that lost 100 pounds. Right? Feeling healthy. The problem is we're dealing with propaganda and you can do one or two things. You could either just say, well, you know, this is this. I think I swallowed all that tobacco. Yeah. It's all gone. Yeah. I was wondering why I'm so hard. You got to to on it. It's gone. I have it swallowed up. I had a boy. I don't know what I'm doing.

Speaker 1:          29:01          Alright. Julian, drink and swat, right? Something like that. Like chris brown, like fuck is under age cousin and then piss on somebody. No, those are kelly. You could fit like three different black people. I don't know who. Fuck their cousin kelly was peeing on people. Didn't. He used to put this lately and molest them. No, that's the other guy. That's bill cosby. Oh, got it. Jesus christ and that crazy. Like, what the fuck man, I can't tell black people are just realized that you confused r kelly and chris brown. Is That bad when they. They're off by like

Speaker 6:          29:42          15, 20 years. What if one of them is our age? Our kelly is, is, is, is he's 49. And when did he play basketball? He didn't play basketball. He's a singer, a singer. Got it. He sets up like the really cheesy anchors to ask him stupid questions like, did you? Oh, you had someone to do the bird is fat thing. That was the best one because you know, if you ever. Sometimes when you go, hey, um, you know, asked me about farts or something, they'll be like, like, so they, they know not to, they, they, they check themselves on asking something provocative or that's not 100 percent pg. So I didn't know how it go, but I go, oh, ask me my birth. So fat and the lady goes, okay. And then. So we just are in the middle of this interview and she goes, white bird, so fat and I was like, a good question and I'm like, I just rolled with it, you know, and then it grew. And then a hot dog eating champion, a guY that was in scotland, she placed tinny place. Yeah. He's like one of The, he was like a super competitive eater, like a kobiashi dude. This guy was assigned. You play the audio on this. It's incredible

Speaker 1:          30:57          life changing stuff. Uh, um, dropped about 100 pounds in eight months. He dropped 100 pounds my cheat day for the year, but prepping just this amazing water drive. Two giant inspirations. First my wife second anniversary today. So I want to say hi to her. And um, there's a comedian I love. He's a big, giant fat guy just like me, bert chrysler,

Speaker 6:          31:23          he's still way bigger than I am. MaYbe this fire him now explain that. Why do you think they did that? Do you think they did that? Because if they overturn your case, if they can somehow or another because they don't want to check. But is that it or is that discrediting you in like that was a gigantic hit movie. But if they decide, if they can discredit you, it makes that movie still valuable. Not only that, it stops me from running for president donut. If they can discredit me. Do you want to run for president? I thought about it. Even living in Mexico from Mexico would have had to forsake of that. That's why I didn't do it. The, no, the uh, the reason why you didn't run for president because you would have to have forsaken live in New Mexico. Now I might fucking when I know.

Speaker 6:          32:10          I figured I could have one. No. The libertarians contacted me twice to come to their convention. They wanted to nominate jesse. Come back to America. Com. Ken and I chose not to do it because I was up for the campaigning. I was up to taking on, taking on the damage and repubs. But at this point, at age 65, I wash up to do the job for four years where I'd have to end my lifestyle and Mexico because people don't realize when you take, when you get one of them jobs like president or governor, your freedom leaves that day. You don't have freedom. We're pressured in to get this money. Then why aren't we making fucking more? Why eric? Am I a bartender in addition to a paleontologist in addition to somebody that's on tv, if I'm making all this big pharma or big paleo fucking money, if I'm such a shill. Okay. Yeah. Is that why I'm a month behind on my car payment right now? Is that why I'm trying to scrape together rent? Fuck. You can aggressive. Very aggressive. These guys. Prestige or fame and attention. There's the bandwagon effect and crowd behavior. And then there are people and entities. Wait, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The bandwagon effect and the and crowd behavior like flat earth bullshit. Okay. We're only seven minutes and 53 seconds into a 29 minute video. Fuck.

Speaker 6:          33:37          But I have a feeling. I mean, I don't, I don't know for sure, but my guess would be that if you wanted to find people who said, yeah, trump grabbed my pussy, it wouldn't be that fucking hard. It's not like you're looking for bigfoot pretty easy to have them be my guess. Right. But so, so it wasn't like a hard thing to do. It's a bread crumb trail. It very simple, very easy. And so it's like when you realize like that, then you start feeling this weird compassion for him and you're like, my god. Even with all his like maliciousness and like weird pervasiveness and stuff. Ultimately he, they, he's like a fucking bowl. They got put into a god damn ring with a matador. He's been doing this kind of bull fighting for like 30 fucking years for better or for worse. And he's, we're watching what we saw last night I guess.

Speaker 2:          34:31          And what's interesting about it, a big part of what's interesting about it is he came really close to women. I mean he's still in the neighborhood of winning plus or minus 11 points or would that means is between now and how many days do we have until the election is 21 days. Listen man, lot of crazy shit can happen in 21 days to shift people's opinions, but apparently again from all those stats now look man, I tried to get. I tried to say any of that stuff because you don't even know if it's true. They're all just talking on tv and they brainwash and all of us to let us think that they know who the is voting. I don't know if she knows how to be just herself. That's a good point. I mean I. My problem with hillary is, is purely an operational one.

Speaker 2:          35:13          I know that if I had handled, I mean even in the conservative way, if you look at what she did with the email server and her colleagues or cohorts did and you say, okay, it's, it's, you know, in a conservative way. I'm looking at at how bad it was. If I had done that, I would have been sent to prison and I know because we had various counter intelligence operations and alto, you're trying to find the lake, you're trying to find the problem and you watch people get banged up for less egregious acts and then what she's been involved in. So my problem with hillary is looking at one set of rules for everybody.

Speaker 1:          35:48          The system is, is broken in that respect, but given the choices, you know, and when you have a choice between someone who is for all her flaws, been in the game for long enough to be really well informed and capable of compromise and capable of, uh, not just, uh, just breaking the entire machine and you have someone who's just, he could just kind of stepped off the set of his reality tv show and then he lied about everything and uh, an elbowed his way onto your television set and never left because, you know, cnn couldn't figure out how to give the mic to someone else. Um, it's, uh, it's amazing. Well, he's a product of attention because they realize that there's a heated race right? The heated race, this guy was really famous and in a heated race, this guy would say some crazy stuff and so they would tune into them so everybody had to do an intro.

Speaker 1:          36:50          So because of him saying crazy stuff, he accelerated the amount they were talking about them. so they're constantly talking about him and barely talking about other people and. But he's created a warm hOle in our political process now where there's nothing so crazy that could disqualify him among the people who liked him to so he can just keep it just like nuclear bombs of craziness that the press can't ignore that the every time they think, okay, this is the crazy thing. He said it's Going to harm his candidacy, so let's shine a light on it. It just helps him, you know, he could just, he could, he could, he could get on twitter right now and say, you know who I'd like to fuck, I'd like to fuck nikki minaj and, and it would work for him. It was work for them. You would see or use a tweet storm of a billion people who say, I'd like to fuck nikki minaj to go get her, and it's insanity. That's where we are.

Speaker 2:          37:45          When people said that was a trump supporter, what they meant was they may have only seen part of what I was talking about. I was writing about his skill as a persuader and what I mean is that I noticed in him the skills that I've developed over decades for persuasion, but at a higher level than I've ever seen. Meaning that he is the most persuasive living human I've ever experienced.

Speaker 3:          38:14          yeah. It looks like trump kind of kicked her ass to. It's pretty fucking weird. Let's. It's two 60, four to 2:15 right now. Is this phil? We are an old trump. This weird. I feel like down because won the crowd one weird on us. Responsible

Speaker 1:          38:43          such a beautiful night. That was probably the most fun I've ever had on a podcast. I keep. I've said that before because I had some. We've had some fun ones together. Oh yeah, but that one might have topped it off. I don't think I've ever laughed any harder, like burr had me laughing. Harder than. I mean, just as hard as you can. Laugh

Speaker 3:          39:00          at the end of it at 1:30 in the morning, trump tweets him at 1:30 in the morning. Little jon stewart is a pussy and would be hopeless in a debate with me. I wouldn't even do that. I'm going to. I'll be the dude. That means he was walking around talking to himself. They do brief dumb for the next presidential thing and he goes, all right, I will see you later. And he closed the door. He's walking around his gold toed socks hotel room. I could go up and say, I'm a fucking asshole. Let me stop. He had probably some woman there, guy Donald Trump. Go on the internet. Want this shit. I had taken this shit. Fucking liberal media fucking tweaking this thing out. There it all down. I think we just violated the new laws. This is like that hillary commercial where they had the little kids watching politics. Bullshit. Little kids. Don't watch politics. There you go. It's all about the future. Comfortable with this. You're not comfortable with lower doing trump. Trump's winning New Hampshire. Hillary's winning Virginia really? And as a little kid here, he decided it was good idea. I think that's totally illegal, right? Like you didn't have a fucking baby while people are talking about eating fake pussies. That was before I didn't, but if the kid was in the club, we shut up.

Speaker 11:         40:36          Sure.

Speaker 3:          40:39          By the way, through the elc spend. Delicious. Thank you. I made this american chopped suey with it and my wife gave a fucking bad review before anybody even tasted it and everybody just said, fuck it. Like she goes, it looks like hamburger helper. I've been shouting it for like four days. I got a respect for that fucking else that you shot. It's like, I'm eating all this shit. I don't care if it's fucking bed. Does it make you more aggressive? what? No, joe, you fucking lunatic. Somebody gets in my face. That might cost me to get more. Lunatic. Ate a little bit of protein. You had to beat the fuck out of people for like three decades before you could like chill. Smoke a little weed, put on your little rascals hat and just fucking

Speaker 11:         41:26          chill out. Can

Speaker 3:          41:29          I say that? Have you heard that study about like, you know how they tried to figure

Speaker 12:         41:34          out like if everybody. They always say liKe anybody can be president of the United States, right? Like anybody, everybody in America has the same opportunities, but what they've found is that some people have one opportunity and other people have many opportunities and that's the difference.

Speaker 6:          41:51          So are you saying the world is unfair?

Speaker 11:         42:00          No, but you were saying

Speaker 6:          42:02          it would have been a mark. Like is a weT dream. I'd molesters most of. I remember watching the kid get molested one time. Oh no. Not, not like molested, but like it was definitely an assault. Boom. And we're live. Let's go check champ. Let's go jam. If you said anything else other than let's go champions. The first thing you said in the podcast will be a giant. We had to start it off. Right? The in the candidate, by the way. Pleasure meeting you finally. Youtube as well, champ. Let's go champ. I appreciate this. So much positivity is happening right now, champ. All around the world, people saying, let's go champ. Yeah, I couldn't imagine a champ. I was. I'm wanting to commit suicide and now I'm walking. Everywhere I go, people are going to miss this. This is a sign that I'm back. You're back. I'm back chat. Let's go chat. Thank you everybody. That was beautiful that you can share.

Speaker 1:          42:59          So I didn't expect any support from my, from my colleagues and. And it isn't that I don't care if I got it, but it's, it's in some sense it's irrelevant. It's irrelevant to me because my goal was. I'm not saying those god damn pronouns and the reason I'm not saying them is because they're made up by left wing ideologues and I don't like left wing ideology ideology period. And I know where corruption of speech leads and I'm not goIng there. So let's just talk about what happened. You

Speaker 6:          43:38          tested positive for some estrogen inhibitors as blockers yesterday, and blockers that a lot of people associate with people who take steroids. We're talking about john. This whole thing is going out with john based on a test that took place on June 16th. The reason that relevant when I went through my thing, I was know he tested positive for semester. Jim blockers, those don't really have anything to do with anything. They don't help you that they're silly. I think you might've just revealed something. He tested positive for two estrogen. Yeah, but no one else knew that. There you go. I'm revealing broke personal information. That's what we're doing here though. Right? Wow. But thIs is like, this is like the only way that anybody could find that out is if you talked about it. Boom. It's out there. Right. And that we're doing here, aren't we? Creating some news. It's a big news day basically. What did you take? So took a. I took

Speaker 2:          44:32          an off offbrand cialis pill off brand. It was, it wasn't actual cialis, but it was described to me as being a cialis and so I thought it was a cialis and I. I just took it and jlp son and leaked the information during my last podcast. So It's out of it's shell has leaked out information. It could be. Is it what he said to me out there? They had no, nothing. I didn't hear anybody talking about, honestly, I'm in a weird position because I don't think you're supposed to. I don't think he supposed to. Anybody's supposed to be talking about the medical results until like it gets released. I don't know how it works. I really don't. I'm going to plead ignorance, right? I'll plead ignorance all day. He might own name. I think he probably took boner pills because that's. They have all that shit in them.

Speaker 2:          45:14          You know, like they have potent pills, have steroids in them always hitting. Right. Because I just found that at joe's gas station over here, it has like the best I've never seen these right on is known for his love of the boner pill. He means what you would call a boner pill contour. He's actually read blogs about boner pills and directed me to reviews of boner pills. Terrified. But I mean these things have steroids in them. They have a bunch of stuff and if you party wasn't the last thing he got busted for cocaine or something. If you bus, if you do cocaine, lot of guys take these because you can get hard off of having cocaine and so if he takes boner pills then he's going to be tempered a little too much. Speculation for respect. No, I didn't think I got lucky. I thought that you failed drug tests when you're doing sketchy shit. Right? But didn't you think there might be some sketchy shit and some chinese? No. Station rhino. Dick pill. I, I, um, what you know about the rhinos. My friend ryan, my friend brian called it, he was on the, on the podcast. He said, you know, john likes to party. I Bet he took one of them dick pills. um, no. Um, that's funny you called it. Yeah. Well he, he was, he was on.
