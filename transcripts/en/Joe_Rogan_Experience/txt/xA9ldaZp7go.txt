Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, when did you know that you like the concept of gender identity to someone who doesn't struggle with it is it's one of those things where you try to wrap your head around and try to understand it, but you'd never. It's like why we say that a man and woman never really understand each other. They just sort of get this thing where they accept that this is how you are and this is, but I never. I'll never understand what it's like to want a baby in my body. I never understand what it's like to have my period. I'll never. I'll never get it. I'll never understand what it's like in any way and being a woman and then feeling like you're in the wrong sex. What does that like and how did you. When did you realize it? It's imagine if you felt all of a sudden.

Speaker 1:          00:46          One day he started saying, I feel like a girl. It would freak you out. Yeah, it would take you out. Oh, without a doubt. Without a doubt. I really most. I mean, I can just tell you what most of my life I felt that way, but my parents did raise me like a boy even though I was a little girl. They completely raised me like a boy because I wasn't very much of a tomboy. Tomboys are okay. A girl who looks like a little boy and you know your Tan and you dress like a little boy. That's okay in this country. Nobody freaks out on that. It's when you start reaching puberty and he started. I started growing breasts and then I started getting my period. That's when everything shifted. It was totally okay. My childhood, but then people are like, uh, you need to start treating her like her.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Not like he. My parents were completely freaked out because they always just. It was like, okay, was that an issue? Because I was just like a tomboy and then when that happened, I think that's when I'll like basically everything all hell broke loose, you know? It wasn't your folks that have the issue or the community that had the issue community or their friends kept saying, you've got to stop calling her. He said, girl, you know what I mean, and I fuck. The daycare will be quite such a freaky, weird thing for people in our, in the world. Basically I manage this and a woman is that, that your penis makes you a man and your vagina makes you a woman that's just black and white for most people in the whole wide world. That's just how it works. And so basically that's not true because it's really how you feel inside your outer presence is just the shell of your soul and your being really. I mean it's, to me it's that simple, but of course people don't get it because people always take things at face value. They don't tend to get to know you or. I mean, I'm sitting right in front of you now. Would you say that I am a woman? No. No. A beard.

Speaker 1:          02:40          Beard. Yeah. No, you're basically a man. Thank you. I appreciate the compliment from. It's just that everyone gets so mad. Oh, the government doesn't represent the people anymore. It's like, well, that may be true, but what are we doing to organize to make it so that they start listening to us again? We need

Speaker 2:          03:00          to do that.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Um, yeah and no. I mean, yeah, and that something's got to change and no in that really what would be optimal is if the people that were in positions of power realize that there were fucking over the world, that would be the best that they just said, hey guys, you know, we, we ate some pot and we realized we were a bunch of cons. So we're willing to like try to figure out how to figure out a way how to reward people for the work they've already done, but yet, and move forward in a much more ethical way of distributing wealth. Good luck, man. These are good luck. That's socialism. Talk you fucking Cami.

Speaker 2:          03:30          People are fucking human fossils. Look at, imagine taking Payoti with Baner. Imagine can you imagine looking across at that guy and he's like transforming into howdy doody in front of you. His eyes are glowing red. No Way, man. I don't know if it's possible. It seems like these are a earlier versions of human beings who, whose entire operating system as a is needed an update since the seventies. There is no. Imagine if you're. If you had an updated your iphone since when iphones came out. That's what these people are like with information,

Speaker 1:          04:06          but they're way worse than iphones. These motherfuckers, they murder. They're on a bbs board of in the early nineties with a 14, four modem. Yeah. I'm the shit cuts out every five minutes. They're not gonna. Want to tell it with a ball at all?

Speaker 2:          04:19          Yeah, well it's. It's the whole thing's fucking wrong, man. I really liked. I had Christopher Ryan on my podcast and he was talking about how in indigenous cultures, the people who never are allowed to become leaders or the people who indicate that they want to be leaders, like those are always the ones people avoid as being the leaders and the ones who end up being leaders are the ones who know the most about certain things like fishing or hunting. Those people are naturally followed. They don't fucking throw makeup on and try to get in front of a try to hypnotize a country by saying the exact same thing. Everyone always says, my fellow American president talk that weird cadence. Why are you talking like that? What the fuck is that?

Speaker 1:          04:59          We've talked about that times on this show you and if you were sitting at home with a guy and he started talking to you like that, you would stop him. He'd be like, what the fuck are you doing? Are you trying to hypnotize me? If you imagine it, Joey Diaz was sitting across from Obama. Joey, what we're doing right now, bipartisan efforts have been reached. We have reached out to Republicans for unwilling to bargain.

Speaker 1:          05:23          Yeah. He'd be like, you're fucking killing me, dog. Definitely talking to me like that. Oh yeah. And also the way he gave me the fuck out. Boy, I was North Bergen, New Jersey. Nineteen 78. Look at this picture. Look at me, motherfucker. I'm on a basketball team with a bunch of guineas. One black guy and a Filipino. Why are you talking to me like that? What's happening is diffusion of. Oh, you're so good. I've never gone over there it. How high are you? On a scale of one to a billion. I'm like six for Joey Diaz to be this high man. Whatever you took, must've fallen out of that shit. Must have come out of a time machine, dude. We met in Utah. That black hole of the bulletproof wolf that pops out a portal, open up word, vomited out. Whatever you ate. The orbs basically. Basically the orbs. Yeah, man, I've got to God as his house. I've never seen you like this.

Speaker 3:          06:46          You're a fucking human being.
