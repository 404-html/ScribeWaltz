Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. A Gal that I was dating once said to me, never trust a girl, doesn't have any girlfriends. And I said, why do you say that? And she goes, because, okay, every girl knows that guys want to fuck them, right? Yeah. And I go, yeah. And I go and the girls don't want to fuck yet. Right? And she goes, yeah. She goes, well, how come they don't like you girls don't like that girl. She doesn't have any girlfriends. So it's one or two things have happened. Either you just moved into town or you fucked everybody's boyfriend. Shit. And I just looked at, I'm like, this bitch is too smart.

Speaker 2:          00:41          I'm an 18 at least 18% more chimpanzee though, Dude, I've gotta get Outta here. Fuck you. I'm a kiss on the cheek. And then the other cig Ma don't hit me. I got to go. That should be a short series, Joe Rogan's defining moments a moment like that. That was a good one, man. Some serious knowledge on me.

Speaker 1:          01:07          She dropped some serious knowledge on me. She looked me in the eyes when she said it too. It's like a really strong move. She goes, don't ever trust a girl who doesn't have any girlfriends. And I remember seeing him, cause I, I remember saying to our goal, I was like cocky because I was 24 when she said this. And I was like, why? What the fuck you buy? Well, who is say, you know, what about, you know, some girls are assholes. And, and then I just, you know, when she, after she said that, she's like, the girls know who you are. They know who you are. And I just went, wow, that can't even argue with you.

Speaker 2:          01:41          Um, the only equivalent I have to that, and I hate to use his name twice and one podcast, Anthony Bordain, Patrice, I fucking wish I anymore beautiful trees said to me one night, I was talking to his black dude, and we're sitting in the back of the envelope, the Boston comedy club. We're sitting down, there's a bench in the corner by the window and we're sitting, talking, we're sitting talking, and he's watching me the whole time. And I'd just recently tried to grow a beard for the first time. And, uh, we get up, the guy gets up and he moves and patrice sits down next to me was the fuck you doing talking to him. I said, what? He goes, don't ever talk to a black man that doesn't have facial hair. What's this have to do with it? And he goes, man, he's trying to fuck you. Any black man has facial hair, facial hair, fucking great. And then I started looking around at every black dude I knew how facial hair. It was like the greatest little fucking

Speaker 1:          02:39          patrice didn't even believe that. He was only saying that because it was the funny thing.

Speaker 2:          02:42          It was a bug with me. And at the same time he goes, you got to learn how to trim your lip. Yup. Cause I, I was white guys. We'll let the hair grow into their lip and black guys don't do that. Dates up on the lip. But uh, yeah, these people, one of the weird things about psychedelics is people always, even if it was one, the most profound

Speaker 1:          03:00          experiences ever, and one most amazing experiences ever, people would tell you. Yeah. But it was just your mind playing tricks on you. Like it doesn't matter and you can go. Okay. But it's whether it was, whether I really did travel to another dimension and communicate with infinite beings that were made out of love and understanding who told me the secret to life is positive energy and positive. Even if it was just my imagination, I still experienced it. I experienced it as if it was real. So whether it was real or whether it wasn't real, I get the exact same result. Something happened that was unbelievably incredible. It took me to someplace that was infinitely beautiful and then something happened to me. Like either that happened or it didn't happen. Well definitely happened. It doesn't matter if it was imaginary. It doesn't matter if it was only inside my head.

Speaker 1:          03:46          The whole world comes out of the inside of your head. When we were kids, I remember when I was a kid, they would say like, ah, he's got such an imagination. That's one. It was talking about kids who were liars, you know? That's how people treated the imagination and the kids were just fevers. You know, because that's imagination to some people. You know, some people they didn't think it was something to be encouraged, but it's really where everything comes from. And that's the weirdest thing about it is the imagination conjures up an idea in which becomes a laptop. It conjures up an idea which becomes an airplane. It all comes from the imagination, whether it's artistic or whether it's a song, whether it's a joke. That's the weirdest thing ever. And everybody wants to pretend that it's so normal. And so normally just thinking shit up out of the middle of fucking nowhere and creating nuclear power.

Speaker 1:          04:34          You know, what did you do it? You sat down and what? You wrote some stuff on some, a pad and then you figured it out. Where's this all coming from? Where's the idea to even do that coming from? Where's the idea that some, some guy wants to be like a fucking bird and put wings on and figure out how to fly. And he eventually figured it out and now we just travel all over the world and we don't think anything of it. I mean, the imagination is crazy. The imagination has done some amazing things for human beings in this world. And yet we still don't give her the credit it deserves. It's, uh, it was kind of shocking. You know, imagination is like the most underrated thing of all time, and yet it's the foundation of our advancement in evolution. Are you hopeful about things when you see like Arab spring, people were rising up and trying to remove dictators and what happened in Egypt? Getting rid of Mubarak?

Speaker 3:          05:19          I am hopeful and I think it's, I think it is happening all over the world and I think the Internet has played a part with it and it's happening in America. Um, you know, I, I come here as a, as a foreigner, I'm British. I come to, I come to America often. Um, I have family here in America. I feel very closely connected with America. And America is a paradox. You know, it's a huge paradox because on the world's stage, uh, America is a very dark and malignant force, which, uh, which does tremendous harm, uh, consistently and has done for a long time. But at the individual level, there's a tremendous spirit of awakening in America. Look, just what's happening with cannabis laws in America in the last, the last 10 years, that's unimaginable in Britain. We can't make changes like that because we don't have this spirit of independence.

Speaker 3:          06:12          We don't have the structure where individual states can make decisions on key issues like that. And, and of course in America there's a conflict between state law and federal law. You know, the federal government is not always respecting state laws and is seeking to persecute people who are, who are using cannabis. But you know, I think that that in itself, the fact that a number of states have decriminalized or even legalized cannabis, uh, is a sign of a, a sea change that is underway at the moment. And what it reflects is an awakening of the American people. So even though, you know, huge negative forces are still at work, and I still sitting in the seat of power, I think, I think there's a tremendous hope for the future in America. And that comes from the, the awakening to consciousness of the American people. And maybe it's small right now, but it's growing and in that sense, far more than any other, I believe America is leading the world.

Speaker 3:          07:08          That there is this, that this possibility for awakening here. And maybe it goes back to the, you know, to the founding fathers on the frontier days and just the, the, the, the, the sense that that people should be able to make decisions about their own lives without government telling them what to do. That's the step we all need to take. We need to move ahead. We need to set aside our commitment to these large monolithic religions. We need to set aside our commitment to large, monolithic states. We need to run our own lives and make decisions for ourselves. And it just happens that that is very close to the heart of what America is all about.
