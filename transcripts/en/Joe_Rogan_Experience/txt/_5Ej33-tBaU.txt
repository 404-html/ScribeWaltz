As you can see, there are pals, opie and Anthony, they have their episodes available on audible.com they've got old lectures, they've got like really interesting, cool shit, comedy specials, you know, a audible also has that whisper sync application that I've talked about before.

Speaker 1:          00:01:16       But quite honestly, I've never used it. I just heard it's awesome. I have a regular one I can't have, I'm too fucking add. When I put my shit on an audio, like if, uh, if I, uh, if I'm actually reading, I have to have it on something that I can only read a book on. And those kindle fire, HDX, those are pretty dope. They do a lot of different shit that you can watch movies on them, you can get online with them. It's like an iPad essentially. And I cannot be having one of those. I'm just, I just fucking, I'll just, I'll screw off. So I've never tried it. But if you are a person who has more control than I do, the kindle fire HD has a thing called whisper sync. And what it is is you read the book at night or whenever you want to and then when you get in your car, it will literally pick up the audio book right where you left off the book.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       It's incredible. Like it, it knows where you're reading ends and that's where the actor will pick up and reading the book. It's really fucking cool. audible.com forward slash Joe and get yourself a free audio book. We're also brought to you by on [inaudible] dot com that's o, n n I t if you have never heard of on it on it is essentially what I would call a human optimization website. We sell you cool shit that's good for you. Cool Shit like kettle bells and battle ropes and, and even ones that are artistic. We have kettle bells like the primal bells that are designed in the form of different apes and the new Zombie bells that y'all self explanatory. They're all zombies. Uh, the idea being that we are all children and uh, we have never grown up and it's not happening now. Bitches too late. Missed the boat, missed the boat on growing up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       I liked zombies. I don't give a fuck if I'm almost 50. I care. No, I like what I like enlarge handles for grip and these kettlebells, they're also balanced 3d balance. We had it, we made sure that there were functional, not just cool looking, but they are definitely that we sell basically functional strength equipment and a lot of really cool supplements. The supplements all, um, they're all the very best as far as ingredients, as far as the dosages, as far as the purity of the best stuff that we can find. And we tried to sell it to you as ethically as possible. In fact, when you buy supplements from on it and like Alpha brain or shroom tech, there is a 30 pill, 90 day money back guarantee. You don't even have to return the product. It just, it just say this stuff sucks. You get your money back.

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       We are banking on the fact that a, it's the best stuff that does work and there's science behind it and all of its explained that on at.com if you go peering around, but that we, we want you to give you stuff that you're actually going to enjoy, so you're going to want to buy it again. No one wants bad relationships with people that feel like they got ripped off. So we're trying, we're trying to eradicate that as much as possible by just selling you the best shit we can find and if we don't think it's good, we don't sell it. If we, and if we try it and like, you know what, this isn't working for me or is this, this isn't getting good feedback from people, we would get rid of it. We would never put anything up there that we haven't already been using ourselves.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       That's the whole idea behind it. Room checks for sport has changed my life and the gym. It's fantastic stuff. Tremendous. And I was scared at first. I was like, am I getting a fucking audit tac? And then I found that it just pumped blood red blood cells and t it just helps the blood optimization. Fucking great oxygen. I'm 300 pounds and I bounce and I go to kickboxing so it works well. It gives you a little extra pump is what us a little extra pick me up. It's a, it's got cordyceps mushroom and vitamin B, 12 in it and a quarter step. Some mushroom is a mushroom that the Chinese Olympic team first started using to, uh, kick people's asses. They found the supplement that a mushroom that gives you more endurance and it's noticeable. It's a real feeling. And I also think it's very legal.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       There's vitamin B 12 in it as well. Um, you can see there the ingredients. If you're watching this episode, which most people don't, there's a lot of antioxidants as well, and two different types of cordyceps mushrooms. And that is the, uh, the magic mushroom that is, uh, very bioavailable. We find the, the, the best form of it. We actually get it from caterpillars. They, they grow it on Caterpillar somehow or another. I don't understand it. That's cool. It's beyond my stupid brain. But it's good for you on a.com. O. N N I t use the code name, Rogan save 10% off any and all supplements jihad. My Friends Joey Diaz is here praise owed and the Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       Good googly Mooglie. Joey Diaz. What's up? Beautiful. Good googly Moodley. We, uh, we did find the origin of great googly Mooglie w what was it? It was like from 19, it was the great, it was great. Googly [inaudible] was the first one and it was from like the 1970s.

Speaker 3:          00:05:59       Do you remember where you heard it? I heard it from a kid from North Carolina. Where's all the marine station in North Carolina? Uh, love of based. That was, that's what he was from. He grew up there like he was a, and he used to always know that I bring up a big rocket Cokie go good googly Mowgli. He was with, with a North Carolina accents. Zappa, isn't it? Yes, it's from Frank Zappa. It's great. Googly Mooglie. It's from the Frank Zappa song. Nannuki rubs it. 1974 74. Huh? Have you ever put Frank Zappa? Huh? With that fucking band like Frank's garage and that's really good man. They were weird. Fucking crazy. Like after a while you're like, I can't do this no more. But one of the best drummers that we have today originated from that band. He created missing persons, him and his wife daily. Terry Bozzio who was in playboy.

Speaker 3:          00:06:50       Wow. Who gives a fuck. I found out about Frank Zappa from my friend Tom. I was probably like 10 or 11 years old and uh, I had this one friend, he's a weird kid and his dad was weird as fuck. His Dad was a super hippie man. He drove a sob. I'll never forget that his dad had this like really weird car where the fucking key was on the floor. You ever see a sob police cars in Aspen, Colorado? Are they really? That's what they drive. And Aspen south. It makes sense. I bet. I bet those things drive really fuck goodness. No, they're, they're made by an aviation company. Like was initially an ADHD still out there. I think they have a weird body style. They're very weird. But you know by the a insignia, Saab has a very, can you pull it up Brian? There's someone who's trying not to look flashy on purpose.

Speaker 3:          00:07:40       It's like a car that you can get when you know it's a really well engineered car but it's, that's a non flashy car. Like a Saab is like an under the radar sorta like really nice high end car stops actually closed down. There were one of the dealers done. Oh No, they went under when uh, nobody was buying them it Tufts sell well, they have that reputation of being ugly, fucking ugly. They're these ugly understating really well engineered by Cadillac. He wanted to like recently the worst way way. When you're Cuban, that's success. Why don't you buy it? Because when I mentioned it on the podcast, fucking service writers that work at Cadillac places where secretly emailing me going don't, oh no. It to paint this bad. No problem with this. I mean so many. This, how long ago was this really mean? Should go, yeah, the CTSV just one car.

Speaker 3:          00:08:37       The, I don't know but took a cow like people hit me up going to dog. Just move on because maybe the, I live in service, maybe you know that now. That's the heavy duty one, which I didn't care cause I would lease them. She, I like leasing cars cause you get much more of a car for your money if you don't have money. That's what you do. Your lease up fucking car. Especially. The reality is cars are good for a few years. Then we get rid of him before anything goes wrong. I wish got so I was leaning towards the Cadillac. I drove it. I fucking love that. Just can't get it that minute. You want to cry like you pick a scar face. Then when they showed up with the Cadillac, what did he say to her? Cadillac? Yeah, the Cuban. No Real Cuban man. When I saw that I go, they had a really good consultant.

Speaker 3:          00:09:19       Listen, you need a Cadillac in your life. You understand what he's telling me? This makes me think you need to get, I was so sad when the service writers talked me out of it. I want to buy American. Fuck those. I want to do all this shit and then I went on the Subaru thing. I've had three supers. I go, it's time to get something else, but Subaru sold me with the fucking free service, I think. Got You. Were free service. Customer satisfaction. That's customers. I always say in the next couple of years, everybody's going to have a good product. It's going to be so competitive, so how people are going to beat you out is by customer service. You know you go to a four seasons hotel in Denver and the one in Chicago is two big differences. Then you go to that Harley Davidson hotel that you took me to them.

Speaker 3:          00:10:00       No walkie. That's one of the best hotels around. You can't stay still in that hotel without somebody coming up to you going, can I get your water? Can I get your menu? You need a ride and you're like, what the fuck? It's all cut salt. When I found out that about Subaru, that's what made me go back to the Subaru. I see. Because it's free. It's free service now. I still got to pay for brakes and tires, but all I got to do is bring it in for the 1500 we're going to for 3,500 right. I see what you're saying, man. I don't know Joey. I still really please. I was getting goddamn kind of a white one. No, you haven't gotten it yet? No, I got the Subaru, the new Subaru last week. You did. So you're done. I want them done it. Uh, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:10:40       So we, we, there's no sense in talking about this. Good luck with the Subaru. Oh, I love it. You don't meet them. At least it's up. Dude. If you decided to go second car Super Bar, If you do that one day, which I can see in the Joey Diaz future for sure. Second car Superbowl, you're getting to Goddamn Cadillac. Okay. Got It. Got It. Sits is passion. If you enjoy it. Look, I had a Mustang gt 500 and it was a piece of shit. I'm going to be honest with you. It's like a new one. Yeah. This is a problem. Yeah, it's, it's got, I had a 2010 and um, there was a lot of issues with the car. Like as far as like the way it would drive, it's because of the rear axle. They've got a what's called a library or axle. It's like a big fat log on the end that connects to two tires.

Speaker 3:          00:11:21       It's just not the, uh, the, the optimum setup. And like when you drive it around in it, there's a lot of body flax cause it was a convertible better than the previous years, but still you could, it felt like uneasy when you're driving it. That said, I had more fun in that car. Then I think any car I've had, like I've ever owned ever, because it was so stupid because it was so loud and it was so fun and I was like, Holy Shit, I'm driving around in a fucking Mustang. You know, it was fun. It was like there's something to that, like maybe the bill quality's not as nice, but what's the philosophy? The car and we'll the,

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       the Shelby, the philosophy was, let's take something that doesn't make any fucking sense. Let's take way more power than anybody needs. Slapping it in his fucking car, put a crazy exhaust on it, make it such as it burns rubber and every gear, anytime you want. It's a retarded car. And when you have something like that, it's you know, it's all for fun when you're driving. If you're trying to fucking Cadillac CTSV these goddamn things. Beat Ferrari's and drag races, horsepower, ridiculous. It's in the 500 Oh, it's ridiculous. I'll tell. I'll tell you exactly. It's a ridiculously fast car. They're, they're one of the most powerful a sedans that you can buy today. Do they go zero to 60

Speaker 3:          00:12:33       I drove and I drove the one under that. I'm not going to lie that and drive the CV XD with all of them.

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       Jesus Christ, less than four seconds. They go zero to 60 in 3.9 seconds. 556 horsepower. That's insane. How bad. There's life in the service department.

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       Seriously. How bad is it? How bad is on when they can't fix your fucking car and you only had one car and I were just going through it. I'm looking at,

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       yeah. Yeah. The good thing is is that that some dealers, depending on how old or new your cars, they'll just give you a rental car. Like they gave me this loaner car, which is fine, that Volkswagen,

Speaker 3:          00:13:08       when you drive driving a fucking fat silver cts V and you just enjoying the shit out of it so it breaks every now and again. You bring it in, they fix it up. When you're driving it, you're going to enjoy it. This is going to be a feeling that you don't get when you were in that fucking Subaru. The Subaru was reliable. It'll get you where you want to go, but it pours the piss out of you. It's a different experience. This is Iceland. It's nice, but it's not like this crazy thing. I grew up in Jersey and I grew up in the metropolitan area and as you know, you just grew up around people. I went to boulder, I went to Colorado and then really went to Bolton when I lived in boulder. I enjoy living there because I always felt stupid. I felt him securely because he's hasn't got a big universal mark people there.

Speaker 3:          00:13:51       A lot of smart people there and I'll tell you all those smart people, I couldn't argue them out of the Subaru. They would come like, Oh, if I gave you this car, the voice, you know, and I'd say, what about Toyota? And they would say, look, a guy in boulder, this Subaru people, and it was Toyota people. That's Toyota. People that have one of those jeeps that they don't even make. No. What do they, what do they call? They paid top dollar like people, if you sell one with 300,000 miles, some genius white dude will come to your house and there's snow. Good. I'm going to call looking at it and make you a cash offer or pay you a thousand over book. And then you're like, what plan do you have with this? I'm sorry man, I'm going rip this engine. Engina and you're like, what do you do for a living? I'm an electronic engineer. I run via electronic, whatever runners. That's what they are. No, no. The other one, the one before I even make them no more than those little ones. Yeah, the old nothing. Let them clinics out of anchorage because the Land Cruiser is a land rover over

Speaker 1:          00:14:50       right. Rover and Land Rover

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       you, it is a land cruiser. It doesn't Land Cruiser. His Land Rover. Right. But the Land Rover, Land Rover, I got confused belongs to Toyota and embolden, you can't buy a new land cruiser. People won't buy the new ones because the power going to bleed hill. So people are going for the old ones and then like putting super engines in them instead you fucking took them to, you know they have a specialty like even bolder had Birch Subaru is the biggest dealer in the world. Then number like eight is Subaru. But they had so many Subarus and bold with it. You couldn't take it to the service department or at Denver. So what happened was this guy left the Subaru Organization and opened it by Lee Hill. Super Repair. That was navy. All they did with Subarus. And I used to talk to that guy and he would talk my ear off, but that dude knew about cars and he sold me.

Speaker 3:          00:15:43       Like he was like, look, if I had $1 million, I still have a Subaru. My parking lot wise, I know I could depend. He would talk to me about it like he had been a Subaru since 1968 there's a lot of who that is really dedicated to those old Toyota said, oh in Colorado because they know what it is. You know what it was when you went down that hill that night with your wife. You know what it's like. What does those Subarus have like the most sophisticated four wheel drive system for those kinds of cars. Like when you look at like the top 10 cars to driving in the snow, at least two at a 10 where Subarus when they had this most reason, top 10 lists, they have good ground clearance. You know, they just, they just figured out how to make a car that, I mean the success is so undeniable in Colorado.

Speaker 3:          00:16:24       You look around and you see Subarus. Colorado is number one. I think Montana, Wyoming, they just, people learn. They make a living. Just on those three states, Subaru makes a fortune just on three real American states that people who moved to New Mexico have them. The Mexico is very sophisticated by where they ski, not where they shot the longest yard or Albuquerque. No, up more. It's fucking gorgeous. Like Santa Fe is that when a Santa Fe is gorgeous but up more? Just one town. Las Cruces. Las Cruces. Yeah. I don't know that town very well. You were in the mountains. It's no big. It's really beautiful. It's a green chili on everything. We should do a Gig in New Mexico. I've never done anything in your mouth. It's just so tough. They closed the comedy club down. I spoke to clay Weda. Clay has a friend that has a rock club in New Mexico.

Speaker 3:          00:17:12       We contacted them two or three times a guys like not sold on it. He doesn't know. Come on, let's do it. You and me show there. Well, let's go do it. Let's do it. We'll get the agents to do it. Yeah, let's do it. So I have to switch around to find a place. Yeah. Whatever's the best pot. Santa fe or Albuquerque has more people. Yeah. Albuquerque and we grind the experts. I can trust me. And then I, I've done research on New Mexico, said Tate's from there instead of that. You don't really want to go outside of Albuquerque. I heard. Really? No, no. Santa Fe. Santa Fe is cream of the crop. Albuquerque is bad boys, bad boys, bad boys crack. He is the real deal though. Yeah, there's a lot of that. Diego Sanchez ain't fucking around. He's down there and running shit. They fucking drove down now.

Speaker 3:          00:17:56       They really do. They really throw down down there. So, but uh, it can be interesting just to go down and do a fucking Nice, yeah, I've never been, I need to go. There's a lot of this parts of this country that I've never been like you ever been to the Dakotas, north or South? Yes. Did you go and see the Mount Rushmore? Yes. Really? I did comedy and not Snake River to the south, which they used to have a weekend gig there and I was Jonesing for blow and I couldn't find any. And I looked into the kitchen and there's one Mexican in the fucking kitchen and he popped out and that was the end of that phone. Wow. That is so crazy. Tribble used to have rooms. Uh, him and his partner had rooms. When I first started in north and South Dakota and South Dakota was a little dirty or I could be dirty.

Speaker 3:          00:18:41       It was a Friday, Saturday. So I would drive from Colorado to snake river, green river, something river. You know what I did all through Idaho? I did go one in Idaho would evil Knievel jumped that rib snake river river. You do twin falls, snake river, Boise, American American or whatever with an eight air force bases. You do all that shit on those j Co the potato run one and potato run to wow. And you'd do everything American. What the fuck is the Air Force Base in Idaho? American home, American something fucking you do everything up there at twin falls. I fingered a fucking Indian chick. I told you the other day, Yoga came out of the fucking monkey at twin falls. Fucking amazing. And she was a real Indian, not like a, you know, like not from India. Isn't that hilarious? You're saying a real Indian mean native American. Not like a person from India, which is actually an Indian.

Speaker 3:          00:19:39       She took, you got to confuse me for one. I'm confused too man. We're both confused. Yeah. This one is a bunch of spots and I've never been to man. Uh, I don't think I've ever been in Wyoming. Great Place. Yeah, it looks cool. Very, very frigid. It looks very cowboy to very cowboyish feelings like state cowboy. They keep rocking it. You have Cheyenne. I'm going to tell you something and you're not going to believe this. And you know me. Cheyenne, Wyoming at some of the best Chinese food I have rated my fucking life in the states. Well, I believe you, man. I used to drive from boulder on Fridays to Cheyenne, Wyoming. It was a 45 minute drive and I get shrimp and lobster sauce and I'd get there and I'd see 20 other New Yorkers standing out there. I don't know what this guy did. Every New Yorker in Wyoming would drive to this place on Fridays. He's guy with cooked shrimp, a lot of stuff. Uh, pork, fried rice and an that grow and it was delicious. Did you ever see that episode of Anthony Bourdain's show? Uh, no reservations when he went to Wyoming? Oh No, it wasn't Wyoming. I'm confusing with Montana. Montana is great too. Dog, but that's fucking weather. Yeah. Oh Dude.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       I camped there in October, in late October. And how was it was terrible. It was freezing. It was fun though. It was fun because it was something new and something different. You know, it's relatively safe as far as like mountain lions go, there's no bears. You don't have to worry about that. So it was killed cold as fuck. But relatively safe. Montana is like, it's still cowboy country. I mean it's, it's really fascinating to speed limits. Still crazy up there. Well, they didn't have any speed limit for the longest time, but the federal government was like, listen, fuck off. If you want any money at all from us, you're going to put up a fucking speed limit. I remember there was those buoys to do like 99 I had a buddy, Steve Graham, Dr Steve, Dr Steve Lived in Montana. I was 75 against fucking pedal it, but wow.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       I used to fucking pedal up there, fucking crank it to the, it's basically the Autobahn billings. Montana used to have like thinking about holiday. Yeah. Once you pulled off, it was right in the middle of town. The Circle. They still do call me their seats 200 it's a bar that stays in a hotel, but I did that for triple thousands of times. Oh, I had the billings has a good vibe. Collin and I landed and billings and we had dinner in billings there the final night and it seems like real nice, real nice. That's a place where you go where you just don't want to move into Montana. I'm gonna raise my kids. What man? There's a, there's a something about the people that live that close to nature saying, I felt the same way about anchorage. You been in Alaska, Goddamn anchorage is one of the coolest places in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:22:21       There's something about being that close to nature. It's like the people or more, I want to say humble. I want to say they're more grounded. They're more grounded by whether they're more grounded by just the intense connection they have to nature. I mean fucking eagles are everywhere up there. I mean they see eagles all the time. I saw like three or four eagles while I was there. Like you, you know what it's like to go 45 years of your life. Never seen a fucking eagle, and then all of a sudden you see a gang of them. You're like, there's an eagle. That's another eagle. One would fly overhead. You're like, Holy Shit. Look at the size of that fucking thing. You see Moose up there. We saw five Moose in two days. Ari Shaffir and I did five Moose. We caught these giant salmon that had come out of the ocean and you know they're, they're, they're, they're fucking swimming up river to hatch and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:23:07       We caught, it was like we were just in a real piece of wilderness. We had to look out for bears. You have to keep an eye out for fucking bears. Joey Diaz. It's the weirdest place ever. But the Papel uh, we were not, no, we didn't have anything other fish drink one. Did you cook it right up? We did one good. Oh, delicious man. Delicious. We, most of what we, uh, we caught, we had to release that day because of, uh, the numbers of the salmon. We're it all depending on how many, how many fish come through. Like if they only have like 20 fish come through in a day, they shut down the ability to catch the fish and uh, keep them. You have to catch and release. But we caught one that was a rainbow trout and a rainbow trout was, oh my God, it was delicious.

Speaker 1:          00:23:55       It was so, because it's so fresh. I mean, you're getting it like right from this river. Oh, it's just the, this, the majesty of that place, man. It's incredible. It's, it's so, it's so weird. It's so weird being up there because you realize that this is how these people live and it's so far removed from anything you would experience in La. Except I got to tell you some shit that went down last night, man, listen to this. You know I have chickens, right? So I go outside to shut the light out in the chicken coop and the chickens, uh, we keep the light on during the winter months inside for a couple extra hours is that they lay more eggs, they lay less eggs when it starts getting darker. And we were like, fuck you bitch, go back to work, make some eggs. So anyway, I go out to shut the light off and I hear fucking running like a big heavy animal running and it's, I don't know what it is, but I know it's big and I hear but bone but up, up alone, but a problem running through the grass.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       And then I hear another one chasing it and it's dark out, but I'm near the hill and on the sea I can see the silhouettes on the top of the hill. So as these things are running by, I'm seeing them running by and I don't know what the fuck it was. I'm assuming that it was a deer. This being chased by either a coyote or a mountain lion. If I was going to be my on the fantastic side, I'd lean towards the mountain line cause I heard more than one heavy animal and he could be that. There was just two deer that were running away from some, some coyotes we showing us here I, this is fox in the chicken coop at night. Uh, well they weren't trying to get in the chicken coop. That's not what I'm saying. They were, there's something was chasing after this deer.

Speaker 1:          00:25:30       It was, these deer were running man. They were running up hill full clip and you could hear the trampling on the ground and fucking leaves. We're kicking up and it was no more than a hundred feet from me. So it was like some real live national geographic shit cause whatever the fuck that animal was was, it was running. That's a least a 70 80 pound animal. It was a big deer. It was a regular size deer. It wasn't like a baby. Whatever it is. It was right. I mean I'm saying I'm being real conservative by saying seven. It was probably a hundred pound deer. So as it's running, but I'll put it on, put it on pro. Did you hear this other footsteps? And I'm looking at, they all just ran by me, ran by me, ran by me. And then um, I did see a coyote, a silhouette of a coyote on the horizon.

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       So it could have been the coyotes that we're changing and the big animals could have all just been deer. Hard to tell because it was so dark out. And I think what I saw was a coyote. It was so hard to tell because it was really dark and you know, there was a little bit of moonlight out in a little bit of lights from some street lights and shit. But it was just so freaky to see some life and death shit taking place a hundred feet from you. Just randomly. Like I just randomly walked into a fucking gang, hit an animal gang, hit these fucking gangs at coyotes or whatever the fuck it was. One mountain line or the coyotes were trying to kill someone that lives in the neighborhood and eat them. You need to get some night vision son, get like a Sony camcorder by the back door.

Speaker 1:          00:26:51       What I need to do is get some game cameras. They have game cameras that will go off when they detect motion, you know, and uh, we actually use them when we're hunting big foot unsuccessfully. But we did get a picture of an elk, but that's what they're for. You know, I would love to have seen what the fuck it was. Could you imagine if I had a cool video of a mountain lion chasing down a deer or even a pack of coyotes chasing down a deer? Somebody's byline, but obviously it'd be cooler, but somebody was chasing a deer and I was watching it all happen. It was nuts. It was really freaky. Like, cause it was a hundred feet from me. [inaudible] problems, just fucking things running behind like, Whoa, this is, you know, this is not what you expect to go out to check and see if the chickens light's still on.

Speaker 1:          00:27:35       Yeah, it's intense. It's pretty intense. All that shit. I love it. I would shit my fucking, I don't mind seeing that. We were talking about that show the at night for the most part it's you're pretty safe. It's just interesting as fuck that we were discussing like Jira was that's found the Moose and skin that took the liver cause she was anemic and then they showed the other guy walking from his house until the wilderness eating fucking weeds were a little bit of a food. I mean they had like four different stories going at once. That was the most interesting shit I've seen as a reality show in 20 fucking years. It's a very interesting show because it's not fake either. They're not faking anything like, oh no, I lost my light or how I'm going to say no, they're not. They're not doing any of that.

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       The actual life itself that these people living up there is so intense that it's, it's worth just paying them to show life below zero. Absolutely. Yeah. To me it's one of the best of those reality shows. I like the Alaska, the last frontier. That's another really good families that are the homesteading up there. And, uh, that's a really fascinating show because they seem like really, really nice people. Really cool like salt of the earth people that are lit up there in Alaska and like, no one's a shithead Alaska. The last frontier is the only show I've ever seen on reality TV where there's no enemy. Every person on that show is a good person. They're all very nice and very friendly. They all seem to have a good sense of humor. They seem to get along great. They seem to be good natured. They seem to all be hardworking.

Speaker 1:          00:29:04       No one's lazy. Everyone does their part, but all they're doing their whole life is stockpiling food and getting ready for the big freeze. And it fucking catches them for eight months. So for eight months, you can barely get around. You could barely do anything. It's fucking freezing for eight months. So the four months outside of that, it's all about gathering food. So the whole show is about these people catching fish or shooting a moose and cutting it up or shooting a bear. They're getting their food entirely from the land. I watched the episode with the White Dude with the Indian wife and she's got like dude with an Indian wife and she's got what he, she's got like three or four kids. Oh, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll girls and a couple of boys and they show them getting out of the boat. She's an Eskimo, right?

Speaker 1:          00:29:53       She's said that's a good one. Where they showed him setting up the net so when the salmon come through that could get them. That was as interesting as I ever saw. What was the most interesting? So I mean, not setting up the nuts was that they involve the whole fucking family. Everybody had where everybody was working, everybody was wet, fucking cut knives and trees and sweeping. So that really fucking was like, wow, that little kids had big ass fucking kitchen. Don't have a job. Fish. They have a job. Oh yeah, like nothing. I'd be puking at that fucker. It's intense. It's intense. Yeah. And you know, I thought that, ask him, I was a bad word. I thought they decided that. Ask Him I was bad. And you're supposed to say [inaudible], but she calls herself an Eskimo. So I dunno. I Dunno. What's the politically correct.

Speaker 1:          00:30:34       I'm fucked up Indian ESKIMO. Well, it's not that far removed. You know, that was a funny thing that came out of a, there was a guy who was a rich dude who was a Mormon who was absolutely convinced that the Mormon doctrine was true and that Joseph Campbell really was correct, that the American Indians were actually the lost tribes of Israel. He's fucking, the dude just made shit up, right? Joseph, that guy, Joseph Smith, who created Mormonism is one of the most hilarious characters. And in all of recorded history when it comes to like a guy who influenced the large group of people to believe him, because the stuff that he thought was so wacky, it was so much of, it was just so ridiculous. But this was a big one that the lost tribes of Israel were the American Indians. So this fucking guys, I am going to prove that this is a true story and the Mormon God is the only guy, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:31:23       So this fucking guy spends a ton of money to get the American Indian native American, uh, genome identified. It turns out they're from Siberia. They all came down from the Bering strait. Like all the native Americans, they, they, they're very, very similar genetically to people that lived in Siberia. It's pretty intense. We stop and think about that, you know, I mean, it's funny because there's this dummy actually believed they were from Israel, but, but it's, but it is fascinating scientifically to think that they're all, they were, I love when scientists get it right when they figured out that people walked across the Bering strait and they made it to North America, they're like, they mapped it out there, right? Like, yeah, look these, you see these native Americans there from Siberia to same folk, same folk who came down that I like it when they were right. It's fascinating. It's fascinating to think that they figured that out. You know, they figured out how people got here and who got here first is always under debate. They're always finding some new shit. They just found some shit in Zuni, New Zealand. They found a boat that was a a a hundred years older than Captain Cook's. So they're trying to figure out who the fuck landed in New Zealand first. Now imagine if he had to live back then. Joey. Dan's traveling around by boat. I could leave the fucking, have you ever done a cruise? Do you work crews?

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       No. Fuck working crews thought about doing it back in the day. Fuck No. In the hard times, you wouldn't to take a good gig on a cruise. Fuck me. Shoot me and shit. I got to be in a boat talking to people. You know what I do a show. They go, I my home, I love boat. Nobody goes home. Fucking cycles bumping into these fucking knuckle heads wrapped the whole fucking day. Hey, how you doing? You're the one that insulted the Christian God doing the afternoon. I'm trying to get a son. I just want to tell you that I was offended by the captain. Yeah. I told the captain and they should h I was on a boat one time that big in the 80s. They still do. They have a thing in New York. Uh, the trip to nowhere and you get on the boat six o'clock. I know we all come to New York harbor and they'd take you outside the city limits and you could gam when you eat like a big fuck the chicken the next day he dropped you off at six in the morning and everybody's good.

Speaker 3:          00:33:38       And I got sick for a little while to take the pills. I've been on boats like fishing boats a lot and when I was a kid I was on every summer and then in Miami and then I started getting seasick when I was, I got old. So one time I smoked a fucking joint limitation. Being seasick is bad enough. Smoking weed and going on a boat on the Jersey shore, that'll kill you. What we freaking out. I just went down on them but I got back to the fucking boat and my friend kept smoking. They joint, he's a savage, he's out there fishing with one arm and shit, smoking joints. He kept saying to me, you're sure you don't want to smoke anymore? Cause I was out. We bought some strong weed and Harlem. I was out. It's one of the most uncomfortable things. Yes, but they'd been on a boat. Oh, that's terrible. Something, you know, being high and getting on a boat or something and something that you're not used to. This time I got on a fucking bro. I got an a fucking plane last week. I got anxiety like a motherfucker. When those little planes there was a spooky spooky. Did you get out? It was at a propeller one or was it a a jet? A little jet. I didn't look, I just sat there and looked straight and sweating. Like fucking noise.

Speaker 3:          00:34:50       No, that's the one that connected fellers Chicago to Nashville. I took it early, early flight and I usually take the 11 o'clock direct flight, but I took the early flight and I want it to Chicago and then I had a fucking fly there and that little plane, it's anxiety and they put you in that little seat by yourself. I was like in three Aa. What? It's weird that we rely on air travel to get to do our job. But we do, you know, both of us in a lot of ways. More ways. I mean what else? And people don't understand that it's tough to travel. I have just made it a simple situation. So have you, we, we've turned it into a situation that's so not uncomfortable when you got to make sure you don't do it too much. That's one thing. Don't do too much.

Speaker 3:          00:35:32       You gotta know what too much is for you. And if you start burning out from the road, you got to back off. No, no, no. I mean as far as like a planes, like I know exactly what planes to catch. Very seldom do I get delayed. I know how to get a plane ticket now. You know it first class isn't available. I can't upgrade. I know they get a thing for my ticket so I could sweep to security and the fucking whatever. Lynn, I just put the thing in for pre Tsa. Let's see if they approved me. Who the fuck knows? It's good luck. Good luck for long fucking time ago. You know what I'm saying? If you can't think of it was true, but show the problem is people don't look at it that way because most people don't reform. I mean, how many people do you think that are like hardcore criminals ever actually fully reformed, kidnap and a couple of burglaries and some drugs?

Speaker 3:          00:36:17       I ain't no terrorists. You know what I'm saying? I'm just a pimp trying to make kids and that's it. I ain't no fucking terrorist smell. I see things from your perspective. Clearly I love you, but I also see things from the law enforcement perspective like, hmm, because this guy, I'm like, are you fucking crazy? He might not have ever gotten their shit together. No, I understand. But you know what I'm saying? You never know. You never know when you have, but I mean how many guys that we knew when we were growing up who were criminals, stayed criminals or wound up dying. Oh No. I know. Like everybody I knew that was a crazy person. Like they don't really fucking crazy. Yeah, that was pretty fucking crazy. I'm just not a criminal. I'm still fucking up debt. Do you think this because you found an outlet in standup comedy?

Speaker 3:          00:36:54       It's just as exciting because I got to think that a lot of the criminal lifestyle is not just the fact that you're trying to get by. There's also a little bit of a charge and getting away with shit. Absolutely. For me, it was the charge. It was looking at a motherfucker going to get what? Not what you were talking about all that shit. Now what? You know, some guy run up to dog talking. To me it was that, but comedy outweighed the thrill of doing that shit and more and more it just stopped. Waited two, it became my love. It became a passion and was like a, it was like a see saw, you know? It was like a seesaw. Just kept switching and the love kept Gretton me greater for common. That put more emphasis on k, you can't do comedy in jail. You could do comedy here.

Speaker 3:          00:37:39       If you sit around the fucking thing with a bunch of brothers and jump up and down, but you can't do comedy in jail. Did you also start to feel like with comedy, you know you're, you're, you're, you're feeling that excitement, but a positive result is coming out of it. Everybody's having a good time, you're having a good time, they're having a good time. No one feels bad about it after it's over. Whereas when you do something criminal, there's always going to be a bit of remorse. You're always gonna think you'll justify it, but there's always going to be a bit of remorse that you've resorted to stealing or hurting people or we all know. I think inherently that's not the way to go. No, but you, you, you and I are very smart in ways that we saw something that a lot of people didn't see.

Speaker 3:          00:38:17       Even though we love something you loved fighting till today, you still love fighting, but you thought about your life at the age of 50 and you said, I want to be able to pick up kids. I want to be able to remember my name and there's no, even with football now, now we're seeing it more with football with me. I know one thing for sure. I know one thing for sure, and we'll sit here too. We find me. Name me a mobster, a criminal, a gangster that made millions and then Diana can or get shot. Let me tell you something. There's nothing worse than living your life like a pimp. I mean, you're 51 get a knock on your door and now when your old days, you've told me a thousand times how much you fear getting older, not being able to take care of yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:39:02       You think of being 50 to the feds come in, they take everything. There's nothing left after those vultures come and they put you in a, they put you in a cage and you get shitty food and your family has to fend for themselves now and they got a reputation. Now these people can't live in the neighborhood. They can't live in a gated community. They were married through. I always knew that the end result, I had an uncle who I loved as a kid and I would go to Miami and my mom would send me to Miami for a summer. My mom didn't let me fucking stay in New York those early days. In the summer I would go to Miami and he built the northwest. He built the southwest. He was a construction guy and he was like, guys we grew up with, he was a heavy guy that did the whole job himself.

Speaker 3:          00:39:43       He was the GC, he dug it, he laid the pipe, he did the brick work, the war, and he became this thing. It became a millionaire. But you know, he used to do, every summer he'd drive out hand and fucking camper with his kids and stuff the bottom with. We didn't go back to Miami and I guess one something. He shot a motherfucker and I knew this guy. You know, when I was a kid, when I was a kid at night, he would take me and we'd go on a boat and we'd go out to Miami and he pulled him the weed and then we'd go to a warehouse and we dropped the weeder and we go to the next day we'd get back to his room of our five, cause his wife and him didn't sleep in the same bed. So I would hang out with my cousins.

Speaker 3:          00:40:21       There were three of them, and I would sleep in the room with him. And at one after tea, women in the old days, the TV shut off at one once, mission impossible, turning off the pledge of allegiance came on and he would go, go, get, go, get ready, and we'd get ready to go to Lubbock. He thought like he goes, those little stores in Miami that you pull through when you buy a beer and a thing of milk and eggs and he'd take a beat and we drive to the boat and he'd get on the boat when I was seven and we pull out, he pulled in the wheat and then we'd go back and then we'd go back and the next day I go play with the kids and I couldn't say nothing. And he trusted me because he knew that I knew what my mother did. But one day when I was down there, one summer they knocked on his fucking door and they arrested him and I was done and I had to go home.

Speaker 3:          00:41:00       And then my mother told me what happened. He shot a guy like in the sixties and now it's the 70s and he says, backing on target practicing and some guy in a new development eight miles away is walking his dog and he shoots and the bullet keeps going to hit him in the fucking leg. He goes to the hospital, they take it out, they scan. It's the same bullet that shot the guy in California 10 years earlier. This motherfucking, the height of his story with his kids, seven to 10 has to sell everything, move his kids to a two bedroom in Atlanta. Meanwhile, he had a house

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       like fucking, you know, 10 bedrooms. He had to move his kids wetland or the attorney had to do eight fucking years. He came out when he was 64 and what happens when you come out when you're 64 broke? There's nothing. He died and I, last time I talked to him was during the tornado in Miami. He was living in a fucking trailer. That lesson taught me right there that that's not the way, you know what I'm saying? I'd rather have a hard life and then it gets easy. And then when you're 60 or 70 you live like a doctor. You want to play with your grant, you want to look at the back. So I saw the same future. You thought you saw it, you saw what the ending is. Yeah. I could end up on CBS sports, but that's 22% of those people. The other 68 whatever percentage number is they ended up in the hospitals.

Speaker 1:          00:42:17       They can't remember that name. You know what I'm saying? Well, I was lucky that martial arts didn't have a venue back then. There wasn't a professional venue because when I was 21 years old when I, I think I had my last fight or they're 21 or 22 but I remember thinking, where's this going? Like they had offered me a pro kickbox and fight for like 500 bucks or something like that. And I was like, okay, well I got to train for like six weeks to make 500 bucks. Like that's crazy. And I know that this is like, like a first fight that it was like, well how much the champions make. Sorry, I found out this kid in Rhode Island that was the world champion and a, I was asking people trains on them. I go, is this, is this guy, is he well off? Like how does he do?

Speaker 1:          00:42:56       He said they got bro, if he, he's lucky if he's lucky, he'll make $1,000 for a fight. And I was like, what? And they were like, there's no money in this. And I was like, okay, what am I doing? What am I doing? I'm either going to get hit in the head in taekwondo tournaments for free because there's zero professional outlet or I'm going to do kickboxing, which I was already sort of at a disadvantage at because I didn't start off my career kickboxing. So to transition from taekwondo in the kickboxing was going to take a little while for me to really get it down. I was getting better with my hand techniques, but fucking headaches, man. I would get head aches wide. I'd lie in bed and know that my head was throbbing because Dude's had punched it. I just had taken shots in the head and kicks and punches and you're fucking skulls.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       Getting rattled around in there am alone in my shitty apartment in Medford. Lying on a mattress, looking up at the ceiling going, am I breaking my brain like am I, am I, am I going to irreversibly break my brain doing this shit? Training for kickboxing tournament fighting three times in a day for nothing, finding for nothing. There was no money at all. There was no money. I came in second place in this kickboxing tournament, there wasn't a dime, which is crazy. Violence for free, you know, and I thought about it and I was like, there's only one option. I have to get out of this for our break myself because I can keep going and maybe I could achieve some goals and started school. But I had known at that point that I wasn't going to be a very good selective teacher because I didn't want to teach anybody who wasn't crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:44:26       Like if you didn't want to go to war, well I'm really not interested in teaching you. I didn't want to do any aerobics classes. I didn't want to. I wanted to teach people who want to learn with every ounce of their being. I want to teach people who are obsessed like I was. I'm like, if you want to do this, you've got to do, this is dangerous. There's people like me out there, they're going to try to kick your fucking head off your neck for real, and if they hit you, you're fucked. And if you keep going, you're going to wind up on the opposite side of a ring with one of those fucking guys, and it's going to be a guy who is gonna try to kill you and you've got to try to kill him. And that's the game. And you want to learn that this is what we've got to do.

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       And if you don't do it my way, if you don't do it the way that I've been taught and the way that my instructors have been taught and the way that everybody agrees is the right way to do it. I don't want to do it. I don't want to hear any cramp talk. I don't want to hear, I'm tired. I don't wanna hear shit. I want you to keep, I want you to force your body to work. And if you can't do that, we can't talk. That's terrible for business. I didn't want to advertise. I didn't want to put up fliers. I only wanted to get the hardest core dudes and women that were willing to fight. One of my best students was a chick that I started out from a white belt and broader all the way up to a really strong blue bell about to get her red belt, which is right before black and talk window and she was bad ass man.

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       I taught her from white belt onto a onto like the into higher ranks and she would just dominated tournament's man. His chick was crazy. She was, but she absorbed it. She was like a sponge. She would come in, there'd be all these hardcore people training and she just got right into the mindset. All these people that have trained with me and that were ahead of me, like my friends like Leroy Rodriguez and Larry Jones and all these like the top level national black belts, all lived in this Boston area and they would all train together and come down. We would train with each other and bring students in and the ones that were obsessed, man, they were fun. The ones who really wanted to get better, they just, you could see them just with every technique they through. They got a little bit better at it every fucking day. That got a little bit better and you see them stretching and working on it and it's an exciting, but then if you see someone who's like half ass in it, it's brutal. It's hard. I can't do it. I can't, I can't, you know, if they're not totally into it, I completely understand. But I don't want to be teaching you. You have to be a crazy person. If you're a crazy person, I'll teach you

Speaker 3:          00:46:42       out of the corner. For me, there's a show to come of school and I go for walks at night. I like going to that Watson 13 to 15 year old, I realized how many was that waste doing cottage, how many fucking I was that way. That's a big point of controversy in the martial arts community. Cod is, and you know what I got good at when I was a kid, I would go to those dumb tournament's in New York and I won first place in college. But in those days there was no full contact. There was oh, semi contact from the waist down, you know, for the waste. And I would always get disqualified for punching. Everybody does that then. Yeah, then I go home late. Fucking cod is did we do, because now if you know the Catia, they'll promote you. It's not like it was that then as well.

Speaker 3:          00:47:26       It's not that in Jujitsu. No, no, no. It's uh, it's, that's how I got my first strike when you just seven months. It took me seven months dog, but I did it and I'm just doing G. I'm horrible at them. No. Geetha [inaudible] hey, it's fine. You just getting to enjoy the actual numbers. I swung on people. I fucking, you already have a lot of knowledge, man. You know, you have more than the average person in the conversations you've had with Eddie and with Michelle talks talking, he's one of the best in the world. He's one of the best instructors in the world. I'm just show the way he breaks things down. I'm so bad at the Noguchi and grabbing people's neck. I got bits pro and I get rid of this time and if you lose more weight, the more weight you lose, the ability to get.

Speaker 3:          00:48:08       Yeah, you just, let me tell you something got melt off being in shape and there's been in Jujitsu shape, I can't go more than twice a week. It destroys me. So I tried to go on Tuesdays, on Thursday days, the guys a, I go to v Mac, but it's a John jock school. I wanted to keep it in the family. It's in north Hollywood. It said John Jack Black Belt Marcello, but they have a could bring your black belt that teaches a purple about and he's fucking tremendous. Joe Rogan, you know, I've always been a fan of just straight Jiu Jitsu. I liked the UFC, but for me, I love watching these videos. I've watched that Brazil video probably easy 500 times for the last two years. I watch all of Marcello Garcia is how to escape from the fucking side control. I love all his three escapes. I love all that shit have and I'm fans of certain people.

Speaker 3:          00:48:56       I really like Stephen Caplin. I really like his stuff. He's a big white guy from Canada teachers. Some basic stuff online. It's amazing how much you could get online. Oh yeah, like you could be in shape, but then this digital shit like now I can do HIPAA escapes just down one side. I can't do back and forth yet, but when I would go, those things are hard, but not, when I go to a hotel and I do comedy, I go to the thing I run and I do hip escapes. I do him in a hotel now that's it. You could get a real good workout with body weight. You the hotel. I do. If I just want to just do something to say I did something, I do a hundred bodyweight squats and a hundred Hindu pushups and that really gets your heart going, man. 100 body weight squats.

Speaker 3:          00:49:35       When you started hitting like 70 and 80 like, whoa, this is fucking like your legs are burning. You have to take big deep breaths and completed and you can do it, but it's you feel it and then a hundred Hindu pushups. It's the same thing when you're in like Hindu pushup number three like bitch, I'll do a hundred of my sleep. But then you start getting like towards 70 and you're like Ugh, you're by the time I do a hundred of each, I've got a decent, you know, 15 minute workout in. It's like it's something real isn't that gets your heart pumping. Yeah, it's just what they bought and then supplement that with some set ups. Do some pushups and you could get like a rock solid workout in a hotel room with no room at all easily. Nice. Very nice. But I like everything that everything's a nice and easy and cheap to do. A lot of body weight stuff these days. A lot of body weight stuff, a lot of body weight squats and a lot of Chin ups. I do a lot of like look all the way down Chin ups all the way down like this slow cause

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       I think that's like motion that is replicated in Jiu Jitsu. Like pulling a body synching up a choke, like trying to pull someone in, grabbing a gable grip, trying to complete a sweep. You know, that's a lot of like slow polling and it's like a long range of motion type thing. Like sometimes you grab and people from way out here and you're trying to suck them in and out. So I think that Chin ups and things along those lines, like things that make your body like functionally strong. I think those are really under underrated. A lot of people want to lift weights, you know, they just want to fucking tell you. They like dude's telling me, I put up three 15 for four okay, what? Whatever. What can you do with that body? You've got a Ferrari that you don't know how to drive. You know, you get this crazy race car, you can even take a first corner, you fall on your head. You're not an, you're not athletic. Like you're not even using this like to get good at a sport. You don't do any sports. He just lift like a crazy meathead. Like you've got to do something with that shit. You're not gonna know how to use it. Three 15 three 15 dumb. My goal at the end of this year, there's three 15 for five, they high five each other and they secretly think about cock slap acids and just fucking, maybe

Speaker 3:          00:51:46       when I first moved to Colorado, the guys next door to me with fucking lift, you know, just fucking insane amounts and they would shoot deca and just keep lifting. And that's all they did. I couldn't figure out, like I would go down, man, watch this. The form was great. They mixed up bodybuilding with strength techniques like dead lifts that had squats and uh, and they did bodybuilding shit. Jesus Christ on a crutch. Uh, I was just laughing at something. What were you laughing by? Spilled coffee on myself.

Speaker 1:          00:52:19       You're talking about your friend who used to have his mom shoot him with steroids while he was doing the line and he was on the phone fucking Costa coffee all over my cause the podcast, every six weeks, they'll bad if he's still alive. He's still alive. That's what I'm talking about. And you know, the guy I kidnap probably called the podcast, right? Told me that is so ridiculous. Six years later, he accepted the apology and he calls me from time to time though, says hello, how are you? When I lived in revere, when I was kickboxing, when I was teaching that a nautilus plus there was a kid he used to work out at Nautilus plus I became friends with, if he's listening to this, I forgot, I forgot his name, I'm sorry. But we were friends for like a year or so. Very nice guy.

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       But anyway, he was fucking huge. He was like my age. We were both like around 21 but he wished fucking gigantic. Like, I don't know how much you weighed, but I was like, I was fighting at one 60 at the time. So I was probably about 160 plus pounds and he was maybe 200 and we were about the same height. And the dude was just fucking swole, like looked way different than me. I got a giant ass neck and giant shoulder. It looks different than me right now. He was just this big bodybuilder dude. And uh, I didn't know what he did. I didn't, I didn't, I was totally ignorant to steroids back then. Totally ignorant because I was always trying to lose weight. I was not thinking about lifting weights and getting any bigger. I was trying to like compete at 154 pounds, so in taekwondo and then one 16 kickboxing.

Speaker 1:          00:53:46       But I, I asked him once, we were driving somewhere and I go, uh, so what do you eat? And he goes, uh, he goes, ah, you know, I have about a, you know, 80% protein breakdown and this and that and that and this. And I said, now, and what kind of supplements you take. And so he tells me, you know, I take a little bit of this, a little bit of that this is really good for your metabolism. And I said, do you do any steroids? And there's a pause. And he goes, dude, fucking look at me. What do you think? Of course they do steroids. And I was like, oh, okay. But it was like the most hilarious conversation because he just like, looks at me. He goes, dude, fucking look at me. Who's world? What's that? American gladiator star nitrile you just had a heart attack and he blames it on a roid abuse.

Speaker 1:          00:54:34       Wow. I balked at all. All we did for 30 years. It's the blow. That's the issue. That's Shane del Rosario, who was a UFC fighter that died of a heart attack recently. Uh, he was a very cool guy by the way, in a really good fighter and a very good kickboxer before. So terrible tragedy. This guy died of a heart attack, but apparently they released the coroner's results and he had opiates in his system and cocaine. So, you know, it was, who knows what caused it. But he also had a condition that he was born with, you know, that uh, it was some sort of a, a heart condition that he had that was just genetic. So is that on top of the other stuff? But the coke is what gives people fucking heart attacks bad. It's just something, did you ever hang with anybody who, I mean, hey, like on a daily basis that steroids was their world.

Speaker 1:          00:55:26       You don't have to see the, the wrestling. No, he goes to buy the juice and the guy says to him, right, I gave you two ounces of this. You know, whatever vials of that when you were in somebody's world. It's like, that is fucking insane. It was just a different dimension. Well, you know what, it's like man. It's like anything. It's like gun nuts. You ever talked to a gun nuts about calibers? Well, like the 50 cal with a seven millimeter, the five six 7:00 AM they start talking to these crazy numbers is 700 wind mag and you don't know what the fuck they're saying. It's you get confused. Well, I've got a three Oh eight I got a two seven eight 22 caliber is a part of those are the bullet goes at 350 feet per second. Like how the fuck do you know all this?

Speaker 1:          00:56:09       They become dorks. They become gun dorks. Like my friend Justin, very cool dude. 100% gun dork. He's a gun door. We have conversations and I say that with all due respect and love because I love talking to him about God. It's fascinating because I love talking to people about anything that they're super passionate about. And this motherfucker is passionate about guns. He's got a ton of guns, he does competitions, he goes and does, you know those room clearing competitions where target's pop up and you shoot out a pink pink, you know, they, they do all these, you know, scoring events. So he, he loves that Shit. So he'll, he'll talk to me and you know, if he'll get as Geeky as I let them, you know, like if I go, we'll keep going. Well what does that mean? You know, he'll just keep going. I mean he knows everything there is about loads and balances and impact and who makes the fucking most precise rifles.

Speaker 1:          00:56:56       And it's like anything else, they do it about steroids. They do it about guns, someone to do it about boats. They'll start telling you about the fucking best kind of of, of, of, of a hand carved wooden canoe you could buy. They have to buy to run it from a very specific type of wood and it has to be cured in a certain way. There's two manufacturers still do it by hand. You know, there's guys that are the W it's that way with everything. There's always some people that are completely fucking obsessed with whatever the subject is. If it's steroids, if it's MMA, how many fucking guys have you ever talked to that are like complete total MMA history buffs like Joe Silva? Let me tell you something. I know a lot about MMA. I know a lot of fights. I got a lot of fights in my memory.

Speaker 1:          00:57:40       He's probably got doubled the amount of fights in his memory. This motherfucker will tell me like if he and I will be talking, there's a new guy that's brought into the UFC and I'll say, what's his deal? What does he do? Joe Silva has seen this guy fight 20 times already probably. And uh, he'll, he'll just rattle off with his strengths and weaknesses are what he's susceptible to. What I would do if I was fighting them. And nine times out of 10 he's on the money's on the D. I mean that guy is obsessed with MMA obsessed.

Speaker 3:          00:58:07       When I lived in Boulder, I had a problem, my ex wife and one of the first people I ever met in boulder at a we'd place, I was living on the hill. The hill is where the University of Colorado is. I was living a block away, not even 10 12 14th street and next to me was the wheat chick. She was 80 and her boyfriend was 20 they were then asked his father really 80 had to be 50 something ugliest woman he'd ever seen in your fucking life. This kid was like both deadheads. They both smoked like death. He, his father invented like the belly button ring or something. He was a millionaire. He got money every month. I found out they sold the weed. I used to go with that bye week and every time I was over there there was this lanky, skinny dude named Ed and I used to talk to Adam and immediate at all.

Speaker 3:          00:58:56       He was from Boston, me and that hit it off and I didn't know where that didn't. Everyday I see it on the hill and I talked to Ed. This is 1985 brother. Right. And I loved that. And finally I let her know what I did. You know, I used to do credit cards then and they told me, you know, we became friends and it was a Vietnam vet, but he was alert. He was the one that went and cleaned up. You fucked up. He went and cleaned up. But there was another loop. There was a couple, it's alert. What does this term something that's bad, like these guys are bad, like danger bat, a cleaner, like a cleaner, bad, like it's just this bad news. The guy you call when the shit hits the fan, the cards and shit, they're the ones that left the cards and Vietnam when they shot you let the ace of spades or some shit so alert.

Speaker 3:          00:59:40       He had a buddy who was named was like, he had like a weird name and that guy thought he was the devil. And I had heard this from other people that that guy and he, they all bought weed at this house and I became friends with him over the years. I became friends with that and I knew ed was a stone cold killer when I went to the vet thing with him Monday, I gave him a ride to the vet thing and on the walls that Bro, there were pictures of him with kids and Purple Stars and metals and I'm like, are you fucking serious? So I thought that was a good heart of the American, you know, bro, ed was a great guy. He was my brother. If he's listening, I haven't talked to him in 20 years. I love him and I miss him. But it was a stone cold killer. I made the mistake of telling that I had a problem with somebody and every time I'd see that we'd smoke a joint and then the third puffy go, so what are we going to kill that guy?

Speaker 3:          01:00:28       And he wasn't kidding. So the guy that thought he was a devil was rock. That's what he used to call himself. Rod was dying from Agent Orange. And I guess him and Ron were doing fucking bangs on the side, like hitting me. I didn't know this and I'm like [inaudible], but every time I see Eddie go, what's up dog? And he hugged me and I loved him. He was my brother, but I knew he was serious. He was like wanting to be taken out, that dude. And every time I'd see him his plan changed. Like he had been thinking about this and finally he's like, listen, I got the cones, we're going to let him pull out a baseline. These motherfuckers want to pull them out of the car and baseline in boulder, like Willis that cones up like we're firemen and when he comes by at nine 18 we're going to pull him out of the car.

Speaker 3:          01:01:11       And that whole plan was like, I was like, what are you going to shoot him when he goes, Bro, we don't shoot people. I told you this. He goes, we're going to shoot me. We take them up until those hills be titles motherfuckers out and we just wrapped with peanut butter and we come back three days later and it's Geesa. All they find is like a little elbow on the floor. She's and she goes to bed. I mean these guys are fucking serious. The parents just eat every time I'd see him after that dog was that scary. You don't want to do this joy, joy. Let me take care of just for you. You're my friend. I love you. I mean, that's how it got. This was like, I've been around some crazy people and that's why I respect Colorado so much. So this day there's some fucking animals walking around those weeds prompt in boulder and I loved that.

Speaker 3:          01:01:55       I mean I bro, if I introduced you to that and you met at Edward, drop shit on you that you go, go, your friends are fucking genius. What the fuck's, he never talked about weapons. Never. You know, he never told you cause a Vietnam vet. He never took them a month and a half to tell me how to drive them to the fucking vet place to get medication. The real deal. Yeah. There's some crazy people out there. That's why I love the fuck fucking comes up to you and goes, what's this guy's number? Let me go down there and smack the shit out of Pauly shore. You know what? I'm saying there's people that will do it. Actually they just wait. No, don't please don't. I just said Pauly shore. I don't know what you shouldn't say Paul. I've got no problem. Sure. But it's fucking this people out there with their fucking phone on speed dial ready to attend.

Speaker 3:          01:02:39       The funny thing is I had a friend who was the same way about steroids and he's dead too. And I hung out with him and this is a little steroid crew and it was fucking amazing. The lingo, the lingo they threw around. What's the way you and I discussed sets going to Boston for the weekend, doing two shows, how great it was. This motherfuckers like, Nah dog. I get up in the morning and do a protein shake. It's like blast off a little deck and then when I come out I take 10 tablets, a deep ball, those tablets of five milligrams, like people would go do one. These guys are doing tech. We had a Jean Le Ballon podcasts, you know judo gene, well famous, famous for not just as martial arts, but it stunt work, did a lot of stonework and he was telling us there was a guy that he used to be friends with a died from steroids who used to shoot up every 30 minutes and he said every 30 minutes he would disappear, would go into his bathroom.

Speaker 3:          01:03:30       He hit himself with something else. It was just doing different shit all day, more than 300 pounds. The jeep was named Jeep Swenson. Do you remember Brian? Cheap Swenson bodies for arms. There was like a body that was his arm, this thing when I hung out with them and I miss him, but I remember how you said, tell me the last shot I do is Fridays to go workout. I go down the show, I do some blow, I drink some beers, eat some burger king. When I come back Sunday, I look in the mirror by boom, let's back it up. That's the guy, Jesus Christ. That's not even a person anymore. Where's the fucking barbarian? But the best of the people who denied doing steroids. You have a friend that came up to me the shoot and he said to me, how you doing Joe Rogan ever tell you about me?

Speaker 3:          01:04:17       The guy is ginormous. A black dude box APP. I don't know what his name, the guy from the pride? No, no, no. He's not a fighter. Okay. He's an actor. Okay. He goes, I'm a friend that Joe Rogan's. Did He tell you about me? I go, no. He goes, I was on fear factor. Big Black Body, but you're very, very nice guy. Him and his buddy were were both bodybuilders and they were competing and they got, they got their ass kicked. I did some, I did some movie with them and the people like, so do you do steroids? He's like, I'd never done steroids in my life. He would say the barbarian brothers again, we go back to the barbarian brothers please, whether by Barry and buzz, I want to smack the shit out of both of them. They used to say that they never did steroids. They just ate 36 eggs a day. Well, it depends on what kind of steroids is shoot into your ass. I mean, I guess it's the, what are your chickens? Chickens are fucking terror birds running around your backyard. Well, you know, those guys, like if I'm looking at that picture, I could believe that either one of

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       those guys didn't take steroids. If you had a good genetic disposition, if you have good, uh, mesomorphic jeans and you really power lift hard, he can get that big. My friend Brian Frazier, I always tell the story because, uh, Brian, uh, who is a comic and writer wrote for a bunch of different different shows. But, um, he was at one point in time a serious bodybuilder and he never did a steroid in his life, 100%. I know for a fact that all he did was eat good food. He, he actually would pride himself on the fact that, uh, he wouldn't take supplements. He would get all this food for vegetables and meat and stuff like that. But he was fucking huge and he was a hundred percent natural. He was just obsessed. That motherfucker was at the gym every day. And he was like, like one time he went on stage and after the show I go, dude, you can't wear short sleeves.

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       You got stop doing that. He goes, why? I go, you're too big. I go, it's too distracting. I go, you freaked me out. And we're friends like, are you fucking huge dude? You can't just, I mean his, his arms like he, everything that he would wear would be like tight to his arms like that because his arms were literally double the size of my arms. They were, he was a huge guy and it was all natural. I'll tell you what I'm here to tell you. Huh? Do you say you think this right here is, I mean that looks super steroid. Yeah, that was 1982 I want to see him today, but Brian was close to that size. No bullshit. But the discipline that Brian Frazier has is like, he's a crazy person. He's got like a radical amount of discipline.

Speaker 3:          01:06:47       Oh. And I got a laptop. I'll argue this point while the guys are doing with eight, seven, six years, I was the stock clerk in the kitchen after I almost blew it up. Don't making the, the, the fucking cinnamon donuts, the cinnamon things. I made them too big and they fired me. And part of my Gig was hiding steroids for a lot of the inmates. A lot of the epics. We get steroid in vix. He's one of my favorite words that you use. Yeah. The inmates would fucking get, you know, and they would get a nothing, I'm sorry. Nothing would syringes. It was an NFR. And uh, there was another one when stroke, when he fee when strove veep pills, three milligrams of a milligram and a half. That was big in that. And what these savages would do, you know, I knew who was doing steroids, but there were some black guys, I've been locked up for 10 years and had families that couldn't afford fucking steroids and they would, uh, they would, uh, these guys were yolked show and they'd been getting yoked. And when I say yoked, you know, low fat, low, low, not a lot of fat, little rip to him. And they were doing this for prison food. Terrible. No protein. I don't fucking know what happened. Well, you could buy protein powder, right? You can order protein powder and there was all vegetables. You get Broccoli and lettuce. It's, it's, it's burger king letters. It's the same shit. They give you a burger king in that fucking cheeseburger. You know, it's not, it's a Nicaraguan shit. It's nothing to share rock. Yeah. It's not let us that

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       when you bite into it, it's fresh. But these guys were getting yoked in there on protein powder, like Joe Wieder protein powder, you know, when it was back then. Now there's still a huge, oh my God, that guy's huge. Yeah. No steroids in my ass. And Yeah, there's no question. But I'm telling you, my friend Brian was pretty close to that size. We did a gig together and, um, I want to say Vermont, Vermont and New Hampshire, one of those. And uh, he had a bit of a cold. He didn't like, his voice is really rasping. And uh, after the show he had a great set, but after the show he apologized, the club owner, he was just real conscientious about shit like that. He goes, I'm really sorry, my voice has been bothering me all week. And the guy was like, don't worry about it. Listen, you killed it was a great show.

Speaker 1:          01:09:03       And he goes, uh, he goes, I just, I just feel like it wasn't my best performance on just so, you know, I just want to apologize. And the guy was like, Hey, will you stop being a Jew about it? He didn't know that my friend was Jewish because Brian doesn't live Jewish. She's blonde. He looks like, um, like a a Midwest football guy. He looks like, you know, he's got blond curly hair. He's says big fucking sick nick gorilla. And the guy calls him a Julie says it, stop being a Jew about it. He just thought that he was being cute. He's trying to be funny. He goes, I am fuck Jewish and you know his face gets red and then fuck you, you fucking racist piece of shit. You antisemetic Cock sucker. Like he'd just like totally takes it like to like level 10 and the guy was like, hey, calm down.

Speaker 1:          01:09:45       It was just a, just an expression of speech. Like he's leaning over this guy's death. The only thing that's saving him as the fact there's a desk between them, you know, otherwise Brian, we're probably got directly in his face and the guy might've swung at a just sheer panic or who knows what the fuck could happen and while I'm watching this I'm, I'm like, what am I going to do? Like he's way stronger than me. I can't, I can't grab him. I'm not going to hit him. He's my friend. I don't know what to do cause it looked like he was like, he was a gorilla and I'm like, I can't keep him off this guy. If he decides to get on this guy, I don't know what to do here. And he just calmed down at the last minute was like fuck two takes his check. And fucking stormed out of there and I tell the guy, well, I don't think you're going to say that again.

Speaker 1:          01:10:24       Sorry. The guy didn't know what to do. He was shitting his pants. He was an older guy too, you know he was, he was, he was legitimately terrified. Brian was an enormous, I mean, wasn't going to hurt the guy. I'd never known him to do anything violent ever, but goddamned he scared the fucking shit out of this dude. He just, you'd never expect that he was Jewish. She didn't look Jewish at all. You know, you think of Jewish, you think a dark haired people. Where is he? I don't know why he's doing, he was out here for awhile. I ran into him once in a movie theater a few years back now. I think he was just writing at the time. It's funny dude though. You get to see anchorman two yet. You know, I bought a joke from him. He's the only, there's two dudes ever about a joke from, and he's one that I never used it, but I've talked about it on the podcast. He was a heckler line that he created and he goes, this is my impression of God creating you. Okay. Just a of current. Oh No. The cap came off too much content. I've ruined it.

Speaker 1:          01:11:20       And he needed money at the time. So what you, and he says like, I'll devastate on stage. So he sold it to me. I think it was 500 bucks. Whoa. It's worth it. That's a lot of money. Hey Dude, needed some money. I thought it was a great line. It's worth 500 bucks. That's a great line for me. I never even never used it on stage. I mean, maybe I used it once. I can't remember. I going to go pee real quick, but it's one of the few things I've ever paid for. There's a werewolf in the new anchorman. I just wanted to let you know very well. Well, now I'm in. I was going to be in any way. It looks hilarious. The fucking ads look awesome. Yeah. It looks like the perfect, get baked and see a silly movie. Definitely get really, really?

Speaker 1:          01:11:55       Yeah. Yeah. You have to get really big though. It's super ridiculous and if you liked the first one, you'll love this one, but there's so many good cameos in it. And when I saw that Werewolf transformation, I'm just like, oh Joe's and shit is fucking, you just ruined it for everybody, man. Spoiler alert you son of a bitch. The anything will Ferrell does on man, that guy kills me man. Talladega nights is still one of my all time favorite comedies. Just for the sheer ridiculousness of it all. It's like, I love that kind of comedy. Like a guy who was like a complete total buffoon who was like a goodhearted guy who fucks everything up. Last night I got to see David Arquette do standup comedy. He came into the comedy store and just like bye and he's like everyone, everyone's uh, bill was on me like he paid for everyone's drinks last night.

Speaker 1:          01:12:39       Like a lot of fucking people there too. That's interesting. Why did he do that? I don't know. He's just holidays I think. I think he comes in once in a while, but then he went on stage and did like a little little set and it was interesting. But you know, I didn't see the whole thing. But it's hard to do stand up after you're already famous, you know? I mean, especially when you're known for doing comedy movies and you know, and then you try to create your own stuff and go on stage with it in that form and it's so, that's also so raw when you got to think of a guy like that. It's so insulated from regular people in like a performance setting. Everything he performs gets put out there on television or in the movies and he's not there when it, when the people are seeing it.

Speaker 1:          01:13:18       David Arquette guy being an actor, comedy actor. But I'm saying like the, the transition between doing that and doing stand up in front of a live audience and a small place like the comedy store, that's a big goddamn transition that's hard to do. There's a lot of, it's really interested in seeing how many like uh, actors and musicians, what just try stand up comedy. They just come to the comedy store one day and next thing you know John Mayer's on stage. Well you know what man, they can do it. It's not like we could do a open mikes from music. You imagine we showed up at open much music and just started singing fucking terrible. So we are the world like we are the world like Bruce Springsteen be all serious about it. I think if you do one of those open Mike Nights, you probably have to do your own music, right?

Speaker 1:          01:14:02       You have to be original. I don't know. I would imagine that'd be ridiculous unless it's a really old song and then you're doing like a bad ass cover of it where you like wiggle it around a little bit, change it to little Dwight Yoakam doing Elvis, that kind of shit. I guess you'd get away with that. I always thought it was really cool when Johnny Cash did hurt by nine inch nails. Yeah, that sounds like one. He picked a nine inch nails song, but two, he made it his own. He was like, it seems like it was his song rusty cage by sound garden until we did a couple of times. Yeah. Yeah. And hurt dude is might one of my favorite Johnny Cash songs ever. Yeah. Just because he was so fucking old when he did that, that video, that song and that video were done when he was, he knew he was on his last days.

Speaker 1:          01:14:46       That guy lived hard. That was the real crazy road life. The Rock and roll life, those kinds of trends of stars. Shit Dude. Those country stars back in the day I cam and you know Merle haggard and all those motherfuckers, those guys went hard. Dude, that's a, that's a whole different kind of partying and that movie, that was a good God damn moves just of the other day. And I watched it for walk the line. The hotel I did as far as movies about like iconic figures, musical figures. It's one of the best. So one of the best. I like she Phoenix, she's fantastic. She's fantastic. And Joaquin. Phoenix is a bad motherfucker. It's a great fucking movie, man. Johnny Cash. It's my dog's named Johnny Cash. I'm S. I've always been a huge Johnny Cash song just because he was so legitimate, you know, like he was so legit. His songs were, they just seem right, you know? You know what I'm saying? Like there was like Folsom prison blues is one of my favorite songs of all time. You know, just that. The idea that this guy is sitting in the prison looking at these guys come by and a train, they're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars. Fuck. He was awesome. What does this right here, a redemption by Johnny Cash,

Speaker 4:          01:16:06       Sin and redemption and thank God the redemption or I wouldn't be here, which is a title of the last song I wrote.

Speaker 1:          01:16:14       He's also one of the highway men, which is one of the great unheralded songs of our generation. Have you ever heard that song? I was a highway man. God Damn, that's a fucking song. It's Willie Nelson. Merle haggard, Johnny Cash altogether. I think someone else too. Well, the fuck else was in there. That's a, he's got to think. We don't love her better. Let her know you love her. I haven't seen it. You know you love her. I love, I love Kelly. Kirsten Kelly Carson. You forgot about that. They just came to me Kelly cause yeah, I'm trying to find Johnny Cash. Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson. That too. It was a tour that it wasn't wise. App Dot. Wow. Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson. Holy Shit. Kris Kristofferson is bad.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       Fuck Aa is all the way up to those blade movies. He was a bad motherfucker is all. Dude's got bored and decided. Tore it again. You know what? He was good at Bro. Payback play a little of that wasn't even pay payback with James Coburn and Mel Gibson. Yes. Really? He's the gangster and payback. Well, he's a good actor on top of being a great musician. Yeah. I'm not being facetious about those blade movies either. I, I loved those movies man. Especially the first one. I loved the first one. The first one was great. First one. I loved Stephen Dorff, his best moves, one of his best performances is the bad guy. You know who else is good in that Donald Loke? Everybody's good in that. It's, that's a fucking great goddamn movie as far as like vampire comic book movies go. That was a great one guy. You know, as they progressed into two and three, they kind of got even like too funky.

Speaker 3:          01:18:05       I liked the first one, but I was a huge fan of that at that comic book when I was a kid. Blade was awesome. He had teak knives, he had knives that are made out of wood. Teak is like a really hard wood and that's how he cares. Kill all these vampires. Yeah, we'll always teak blades. It's amazing that when things go bad for an actor, they always, they, it pisses me off that they get into comedy and that pisses me off that they try it. Like if it's just another day at the fucking office and if they only knew that it's not a another day at the office, a lot of them try it for a while and they make it on charisma and stage presence, dance moves and tops of girl would say it's a 30 minute thing to be up there an hour. It really needs to perfection and the whole thing and it's just something that it doesn't.

Speaker 3:          01:18:54       Either way it micro. It just surprises me that somebody could think. It's like if I can say, you know what, instead of going to the show to con white belt class, I'm just going to go to the black belt class and I'm just going to walk in there because I could throw a good sidekick. That's what you're making me feel like you're not respecting the people around you it, I don't think they have any idea what it is. No, they don't. They don't. They don't. They know, but I don't think any of us did either. I don't think we really knew what it was until we started doing it. Yeah, but we stuck with it. That's the difference. They could too, right? I mean all, I mean it's hard to make a big generalization, but they could. There's guys who have started out as actors, got into comedy and actually fell in love with comedy and liked it better than I ever have a leak in your thing.

Speaker 3:          01:19:32       You always call the plumber. You don't have to do it. Your, I have a love for plumbing, but you're not going to fucking do it yourself or you. And that's why I don't take offense. It's just something that really bitch, really, you're just going to walk into the dancing. You got to take over this motherfucker like GSP. Well you love comedy and you're also very competitive and a lot of ways like your, your idea about a comedy like is very competitive and the comedy is, uh, that's, that's the, the highest heights and then these people that want to slide over his actors and think they're going to disrespect it. Yeah, no, no. I would never, ever disrespect somebody like that. I can't imagine like, oh, that looks easy to do. I know. Some way. That's the problem. It's really weird that now more than ever, I get emails from people that yeah we, you know, death squads and inspire on to do stand up and they get on stage and that's great. But then there's that second journey, there's that second push that it really comes from you. Yeah. A lot of people just don't get it just, it's just

Speaker 1:          01:20:28       longterm proposition. There's no way around it. You can't pretend, you know, you can't do it for a couple of years and come up with a few minutes and think you're a fucking national headliner cause you're not. It's a long term proposition and a lot of it is based on your, you're going to have a bunch of different kinds of crowds, a bunch of different kinds of scenarios and you're going to have to find your voice by navigating all those different waters. And it's tricky and it's not easy. It's going to take a long time. You're going to restructure your act. You could have shows where bits kill and then another show we're bit turns the whole audience off and you can't figure out what the fuck went wrong. You got to figure it out. It's not about having a couple of good shows. It's about massive consistency over hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of shows and figuring out where your voices, that ain't easy no matter what you're doing.

Speaker 1:          01:21:11       If you were doing fucking slam poetry contest, if you were writing books, if you were saying in songs like finding your particular voices, fucking hard man to be genuine, to be completely unique and genuine and [inaudible] and completely original, like to your own thoughts. It's very hard. Very fucking hard. Just seems easy because he'd go downstage and be like, what's up bitches? What are you doing that you know? And you start talking shit and people are laughing. You're like, Cam, I can talk shit too. But they don't realize how much work it took to get you to where you could just figure out what are the right words to say, what's the right mindset to be? And when you're on stage, what are the right combination? What's the right way to settle into bits? What's the right way to lead them into a story? What's the right way?

Speaker 1:          01:21:57       What keeps them activated? What backs him down would picks them up. It's like if there's a little dance you're doing when you're up there, like I watch it, I know what you're doing, I see it and I've known you forever. I knew you back when you were having a real hard time with stand up. Which to me is fascinating because you're the only guy that I've ever met that was having a really hard time with stand up and then add a nowhere. Like you hit a switch. You went from having a hard time with stand up to being a fucking murderer. We would, it was almost like you like you fucking pass through a doorway or something. Like within two years of you working at the store, you just figured it out. He's figured it out one night and we were up on stage and we're, we're in the back rather. And you were up on stage. We were watching you like, Damn Joey Diaz just turn a fucking corner. You just figured out how to be funny. You figured out who you were up there.

Speaker 3:          01:22:49       It's really weird when you, uh, you get into anything. There's always that Jesus, I'm not improving. Yeah. Of calming him showing up and this is just isn't working and then one day out of the fucking blue pop pow, it just starts working and it's really weird. It was stand up. You don't want to go to sleep, you want to go home and keep writing and writing. And then I became infatuated from 95 to like 98 but I had so many other things going on. You know what I'm saying? I had so many fucking things going on that I couldn't really focus, focus and then I moved to La and I had all these distractions. You have all these stupid distractions when you first moved to La and you're a karmic agencies, this, that, this, that, and then one day you just, something hits you and it goes, these mother fuckers don't matter.

Speaker 3:          01:23:40       Nothing really matters. I've got to go up there and speak what's in my heart and you just start going and little by little, once you find your voice, you become a savage. That's it. It's like a, it's like a shark tasting blood. It's like anything else. When you get that taste and you just go after it and, and you know the comedy store is the fucking comedy store man. Once you get in the car mystery. To me that's like, you know John Job, that's the comedy store. That's it's as John Jacques Machado, it throws up a high level that that's it. It's a high level, especially in the two thousands when we were down there and there was, there was some intense comedy, there was growing something for your countenance already coming up there and you coming up there. It was a really intense time and you go onstage and you get this weird confidence and it's this fucking thing.

Speaker 3:          01:24:30       You just get stronger and stronger in the more people you go up in front of cars. Then in the beginning they make it go up in front of people. You know, going up in front of Mitzi shore is nerve wracking and going on after they put you on after a lot of guys that were really fun and you're going up in front of Mitzi shore, you have no idea what that does to you. At the six year mark going up. I cannot describe it. I've thought about it and I've written about that experience thousands of times and nothing was more like I blacked out. I had a blackout to go in front of Mitzi shore because I knew it was it for a guy like me, Mitzi shore turned me down. You know what? I was going to go back to boulder, probably stabbed one of those motherfuckers without come out.

Speaker 3:          01:25:14       I would just, when getting out now I would have been institutionalized. There's no turning back from that. It would have crushed my ego. Her, her taking me gave me another five year reprieve in my life. I knew I got something to do for five more years before I go to jail for killing somebody. Like that's how I felt. Did you really feel like you're going to do that? Cause when I met you I never got that from, yeah. Yeah. I was part of the part of the, the the, the jumping my comedy was the day I wrote her the letter and I said, you can't scan me no more. You want to take the kid, take the fuck you can't, what am I going to fucking dirt road were talking about you called her up one day and told him I didn't know who you're talking about.

Speaker 3:          01:25:49       Yeah. I told her that I didn't, you know that at the end of the day and I was being this, you know, some people really cannot handle the truth and sometimes you have to tell him and I had a talk to her and then talk to her again in 99 when I took that change, it was around 2000 met me in 97 it took me about three years, but one day in [inaudible] 99 before I went to bed, I was clean for a couple of days, maybe three days, and I went to bed early and I had my, which to me and I said, I'm not going to fuck with this no more. It was one of these things that I was going into the lion's mouth. I had a walk on a fine line with her because I wanted to be a part of that kid's life, but it wasn't looking that way and I was going to take her shit no more than one morning I got up room and I went and got a calling card and I call that mother fucker and I just laid it out to her and I told her the opening line was, I'll never forget this, that listen between you and I and she knew me.

Speaker 3:          01:26:40       I said, you know, if you want to find I would not pass on you. We contact I'm having with you is because of this child. So I pay for a separate phone in her room and I don't have to talk to you no more. Cause she wanted what was killing me at that time when she wanted to take and change the child's name. And my position was when my father died, my mom remarried, my poor dad that died, I had to keep his fucking name. That was just something in my heart. So I always felt that that's let her become 18 I'd have to decide what the fuck she wants to write. That was eating away whammy when they add no value. A name didn't have a value to me and this whole situation didn't have a valid to me. Once I analyzed it and said, fuck this bitch and what she stands for, I turned that corner because I dropped luggage off. There's nothing sometimes in comedy, sometimes in life you're just carrying around some luggage, man, that doesn't let you move. The box is five feet, but the door is only three. Sorry motherfucker. And you've got to drop that shit until you dropped that fucking box. You ain't going to go through that door too.

Speaker 1:          01:27:41       People get locked into those relationships, whether they're friendships, friendships with former ex, you know, ex wife and husband, whatever you want to call that relationship, exes. But they're like two deer with their fucking horns locked together and they can't separate and they fucking, every day is a push poll. They fuck with each other on purpose. You know, I've, I've known people that went through horrible divorces where, you know, you could tell that like they would, they would like be setting up each other like, you know, fuck him, make him pay more, you know, uh, let's, let's agree to one thing and then change the terms. Just keep, keep the bills coming in and like, I've heard people talk like that. So it's a horror show. It's crazy and it's scary.

Speaker 3:          01:28:20       And this is, this was the bad end of it, Joe, that this is the already at the job in boulder that paid the most educated schmuck like me. I was working for a sports adviser and that you can make anywhere from 20 to 60,000 to football seasons, six months. You can make some calves and that's insane. There was some guys that make a hundred grand. There was, I had a month in December, I made 25 grand work in the fucking phones. You just got to get some fish. Tibetans send you money, believe that your is, you're going to take them through the fucking bowl season. Listen Bro, you want to make 50 it's going to cost you 20 go to Western Union seminar 20,000 and we'll talk about sending them. Basically buying your knowledge, your knowledge, but you're buying your bullshit. It's bad Karma also. Really, this is what I was doing, so I knew this.

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       I knew this. All right. I come to La, Mitzi shore it on past me. Maybe the Improv pass has been, but my dream was Mitzi shore. Who the fuck are you kidding? My whole thing was the store from day one people told me to go to the fucking store. That's your house. That was my fate. If she turned me down, I would have probably gone back to Colorado. Probably gotten to work over there. You were there. You'd done sets in Seattle. You were doing, when I couldn't go back to go to Seattle, I would've gone back to Colorado and tried to be a dad and one day ago I know me one fucking day. The car breaks down, there's snow and out. You get one of those bills and overdue bill and that's it. You bump into this fucking book and it gives you that attitude with his flip flops on.

Speaker 3:          01:29:44       I was going to run over this motherfucking, I was gonna do 50 fucking years. So you know what, as much as I, the comedy store has that much power in my life. Came along at the right time, came along at the right time. Do you think that people create that? I mean that's like the big, uh, the big hippy, new age, uh, argument about lives that you create these possibilities in life, that you're, you're responsible for all these different events that are happening too. They're not random events. These are events that are sort of created by your own intentions. Yes. Do you feel that sometimes, absolutely. One thing I learned was that until you take responsibility, you ain't gonna move forward. Cause motherfuckers that get off the stage, Bro, the audio sucks the sound. I watched a guy eat the pipe quite fucking bombed. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:30:33       And that's it. And then everything else. And until you come through that, you can't really, and that was big for me that I believe that they listened. I go to bed now, I go home, I put my feet up, I watch the news and I go to bed like nothing. You know, 20 years ago I didn't go to bed like nothing. I had to shut my window a certain way and close my door, shut away, and I couldn't leave the light on at night because I owed money to a drug dealer like rob somebody. I created all those scenarios. I didn't, I didn't make that kidnapping up. I went there with a gun. I knew what I was doing, but it's funny how quick the turnaround was between like 99 you know, like it's, it all just sort of stopped. It all stopped loving and they kept stopping.

Speaker 3:          01:31:14       You know, it kept stopping. What you're telling me is that I never did blog at after 2006 that's, you're trying to tell me who me. That's you're trying to tell me why. I wouldn't say that. I'm just saying that's the weirdest way to phrase that sentence. I haven't done Boston one day. One day, one day I went home with a check. So one day I went home. I just stopped doing book. That's what you're trying to never done that again, number one. So what I'm saying? I'm saying about being a criminal. No, no, no, no. I'm busting your balls. I can't believe what I'm fucking telling you. That's night. 2006 one day I went home. Brian, one day I went home and just stopped doing cocaine though. Rehab, no hug. I didn't call nobody. I didn't piss my ear. I didn't give my life to Allah was no all big game.

Speaker 3:          01:32:02       There was none of that shit. Okay. Whatever the fuck that shit is, he never go with nothing. Uber Game. So my point is that what happened was I dropped, I kept dropping the pain that I had at that luggage that I had. I forced it out. I just didn't fucking stop doing drugs. I overcame whatever was making me do those fucking drugs. Society wasn't making me do drugs. Obamacare. How funny is that? They found heroin in the Bronx with Obamacare envelope. Austin, Boston man hysteric instead Obamacare on, it was on heroin, Obamacare, everything. In a lot of ways it's random things that happen as well, right? Because I broke this sometimes. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       People wake up on the wrong side of the fucking bed. They come at you and you understand your fucking ground and you got to stay. No Bitch. And people get their feelings hurt. Yes. But no, I created a lot of shit that happened in my life. There's no fucking way. You also have to stop silliness or it'll invade your life and ruin your quality of life. Like if you don't get upset at people, sometimes there's times where people are infringing on your happiness with your bullshit bullshit. And you're like, listen man, you need to learn your own for your own good. You need to learn that what you're doing, it's like socially unacceptable. You're, you're passing it off on other people. You're passing off this shitty reality that you're trying to promote something you, you can get locked in a person like that, as we were saying before, with like bad relationships.

Speaker 1:          01:33:28       And then all of a sudden, like every day you're dealing with this person's nonsense distortions and lies and it can never trust. Like who was it your fault. No, it's never your fault. Right. And it's never your fault. It's always somebody else's fault. And when you deal with people like that on a regular basis and you communicate with people like that, it makes it incredibly difficult for you to live your life because you're constantly, you're constantly like debating or dismissing bullshit. Like is this bullshit? It might people shit. And then somewhere along the line you realize, well, fuck this man, I got to stop hanging out with this person. This person's an asshole. You know, that person doesn't give a fuck about the truth. They don't give a fuck about me. They just, and I've had a few of those in my life and you just cut them loose and when you cut them loose, like you're a way better person, you're like, your life is free and easy.

Speaker 1:          01:34:13       And I'm like, oh, it's not that I'm like constantly engaged in conflict. It's that if you surround yourself with the wrong kind of people, you will be constantly engaged in conflict. Whether you want it or whether you have that intention or not. Like, it's not just about having the right intentions, you gotta make the right choices as to who you put in your world. Because if you put a bunch of shitheads that don't care about evolving, they don't care about getting it together and all they're trying to do is pass off a nonsense on you. Oh you gotta fucking, you got a Shitty road. You've got a shitty road ahead of you. You know I used to love guns. I wasn't a gun up like your buddy, but I loved guns. I love having them. I loved them. And the same thing one day I was like, every time I carry a gun that's a,

Speaker 3:          01:34:59       let's put that out there almost right? It's like a magnet for other guns and you're not the only one that says that. It's like a magnet. I'm telling you, when I carried a gun, I carry the Gulf for a very short time because I didn't like it. I didn't see the purpose for it. It's a nice thing to use to try to be a tough guy, but all it's going to do is get you in fucking trouble. Cause you pull that motherfucker out wanting motherfuckers going to pull that money. You got real tough guys. And I knew that going in. I fucking knew it. I wanted to fire it at somebody. But I tell you what man, it was amazing how he used to go home at night and go, what the fuck just happened tonight? Why did I have to go from my reach from like Gunther it, why would it six other people in the room and a coke party with guns because guns attract.

Speaker 3:          01:35:42       They're like fucking magnets. And one day I got rid of all those guns. It was like I lost 18 fucking pounds of drama. The same thing 10 years ago, this phone would be ringing with people that were asking me questions about, you know, how do you get roadwork? You know, why don't you take me on the fucking road. You know you can all these fucking people calling you with these questions and then at the same time they have low concern for you. They really don't. They're just trying to pull you down. Especially in this fucking town. If you let people pull you down, but I don't know what you're doing. It's not happening for me. What do you want? What do you want me to do? You got like right and get on stage every fucking night. What'd you do? Ask me. Oh, I went to my sister's wedding.

Speaker 3:          01:36:22       Well go fuck your mother. Then go to the fucking wedding. You were one of the last guys that picking that out too. It Burns my fucking core that people come up to you and put their lack of Vietnam. I saw somebody, but I started calling me with at the store 13 years ago. I was going to screen some stupid movie that my buddy was in. My wife was sleeping. So let me go down there and as I was walking around the corner, her, Joey and I went up and I go, I didn't even know who was. And he was telling me what he was doing in front of their house. He was working, you hear about this? And he was telling me, you know what he was doing there and what he was, he was working and I drove back to fucking studio city with like tears in my eyes because he had every opportunity that I had.

Speaker 3:          01:37:10       He was a good look and knew when they moved to this fucking town. But to him, he used to go to the store and drink and everything was how e and now I'm supposed to feel guilty on the fucking one-on-one cause this fucking schmucks got a job working until fucking two in the morning parking cars or something, you know? I mean, we all had the same opportunities here. Well there's people that feel like those people in your life to teach you that lesson. To see people fail and have regrets and see people not give 100% or not give it all their focus or give it all their honesty, you know, give it, give it who the fuck you really are. We see those people and that regret is almost there to let us know like don't ever let that happen again. As I was getting in my car, he made a comment and he was one of those guys always had to have that one comment that the store, they may like a fucking comment. I just want to say something about something. It must've been nice doing blow all those years, like something just, you know what I'm saying? Like he's one of those guys that he's put you down, right. He had a, and I just got in the car, like I said, you know, this is why that guy's parking cars and you know, I'm on the fucking road work and at least try to make things happen. This is why this guy is barking. Fucking,

Speaker 1:          01:38:19       there was a guy that I want to mention his name but you a, you'd warned me about him a long time ago, long before it ever went real bad form. And then one time I was back in the east coast and the guy hadn't done comedy and he fucking a couple of years and he's like trying to get ahold of me to open up for me. Like what? You just, you just got to get back on stage after a couple of years and open up at the big show. Like really? That's where you're going to do? Oh, you had your fucking mind. Like what kind of weird request is that you haven't done comedy in two years. You, you want to go up and a in front of a sold out club. Like that's, that's ridiculous. Like why would you think that you could just do that like you get, but that's what they, there's a lot of guys that didn't make any comedy that felt like they didn't make it because nobody helped him.

Speaker 1:          01:38:56       And I've heard that so many times I've heard that stupid argument like I wasn't in with the right group or if you're not in with the right group, it's very hard to get roadwork like what are you talking about? What do you all you have to do is be funny. If you're funny, people find you. It's one of the easiest businesses of all time. You get proven onstage for sure. Easiest to understand. This is how easy it works. You go on stage, you get the people to laugh, people notice. Then they started offering your work. It's that simple. When you prove that you have a certain amount of time and you prove that you can consistently perform really well. People want to give you some mark that give you a little here. They give you a little there. You make some connections, you start networking.

Speaker 1:          01:39:33       The next thing you know you started, you know moving in your area a little bit, getting a few gigs here and there and it takes fucking years and you've got to keep doing it. If you don't keep doing it, then you really didn't want to do it. But if you do keep doing it, you get to a point where you're Joey Diaz and if you're one of those guys that didn't really want to do it and one day you see Joey Diaz and he said it moves been good foot. Duke cuckold Hoosiers. Hmm, you're there. You're like a living lesson. Like that guy's like a little, a little stop on your journey.

Speaker 3:          01:39:57       Well, it's a book. I broke my on the drive home. I was like, wow. And when I had the same opportunities, we both walked into that store. He used to get spots. He was good. He was decent. Yeah, showed potential whatever, nine o'clock spots, couple belly room spots and now you're out here with fucking the 11 o'clock at night and you know like wow, that's,

Speaker 1:          01:40:20       that's with everything Joey. That's with music. That's with writing. That's with anything where it's up to you to create what you put out there. It's a lot of people fucking false.

Speaker 3:          01:40:29       What's Bill Hicks? His friends not think of the guy from Portland, Oregon that he was started at Houston width and they both will pour on them. Let me talking about comic. Yeah, he was important. He's from Houston, Texas. Also guy with all the tattoos all over her. I don't know. He uh, they did comedy at some place in Houston. Not Jimmy Pineapple. No, no, no, no, no. To kind of, what was a funny Tennyson, this kid is, is still alive

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       and he's still on the road. Yeah. Yeah. Jimmy Pineapple still. He didn't, this guy is in Portland, Oregon.

Speaker 3:          01:41:00       I'm not sure. I didn't hear anything. Dale Dame. Uh, I think he's even managed by somebody in La cause he was doing some gigs at the Improv. I saw he wrote something 25 years ago about his after bill died, about his relationship with bill, how bill moved to La and he got married and build it the tonight show. I had a kid and bill did HBO. I had another kid and bill was on tour and while we still remained friends, it was a beautiful and he goes, I never had jealousy for him. All I wanted was the best because I knew that he used the one that they used to do comedy at the pizza place with in Houston, Texas early on pizza place. They should do.

Speaker 1:          01:41:42       Yeah, I know who you're talking about, but I don't know who you're talking about. Mac, Lindsey. There was a no, no, no. There was a bunch of those guys from that. Why would you even say Mac Lindsey? Because I thought that, I mean he used to hang out with that. Lindsay was so much younger than those guys. More than 15 years younger than those guys. Easily. Maybe even 20 white slate slate. That's it. To white slave boy. It's lit.

Speaker 3:          01:42:05       Also went up to Portland. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:42:09       yeah, those guys, those comedy outlaws. What's fascinating about all those guys was how much they were so obviously influenced by Kennison. Those guys got in a world, I mean they were very talented guys. I worked at Jimmy, Jimmy Pineapple, one of the first times they ever came to Houston at the last stop. Very funny guy. But they were all real good, real solid comics. But they were so obviously caught up in the the wave of this one wild fucking maniac. Even when I first saw Hicks, Hicks had like all these Kinison mannerisms, like he probably didn't even realize it. He was like so used to being around Kennison and Kennison just being the man like 86 86 Kennison was like for people today cannot explode. They can't really understand what kind of an impact that guy had on the world of standup comedy. He threw the whole fucking bored in the air.

Speaker 1:          01:43:00       The whole, the whole thing was changed by one guy, this big fat guy screaming about pain. Nobody had ever done that before. It was a completely new thing and the jokes were crisp and they were solid and he got to the end. They had really good points like about the kid in Africa, you know about being married. I wasn't making, you know like about going to hell like hell would be like club med. Get Devil goes well he'd been married. Wow, this is fucking old hat for you. Come on, I'll show you around. This is where we tortured souls when he would, when he would talk about like his life and his payment, it gets fucking red in the face and scream out. There was nothing like that, nothing like that at the time. And so these guys, they're all the, all these outlaws, the comedy outlaws, they all got swept up in the wake of this mad genius, a mad genius with a head injury.

Speaker 1:          01:43:49       You know, his story is fucking book. His book is Great. His brother wrote a book called, uh, my brother Sam. Sam. It's a great fucking book. If you're a standup comic, you, I'll give it to you. I find that I get it for you on Amazon. See if we can find it on Amazon. I'm sure there's probably some used copies that are available. It's a great fucking book. I read that and Seattle in 95, one of the most important parts of stories. How can, it seems like a regular kid, normal, shy and regular kid gets hit by a fucking car. He get hurt, like really bad, like bad head injury. And then he comes out of that just a wild motherfucker, which is wild and reckless and confident and crazy. Like literally he got head injuries into being the greatest comic of all time because he went from there like right into like he was doing all that invent gelical preaching and he took that energy and wrote it right in to stand up.

Speaker 1:          01:44:43       And a lot of it came about. Most likely if you listened to his brother, who knows better than anybody. It's the personality changes because of a head injury that's fucking crazy. His brother was crazy effort. They were all crazy. Just brothers. Carla bowl was crazy. All those dudes were crazy. Call the Bose still out there banging and banging it, hitting the clubs. The clubs still loves it. You know? Look, even, you know, somebody tried to explain this to me once a long time ago about standup comedy and he was like, look man, even if you just earn enough to make a living, he earned the live in talent jokes, jokes. Oh, it's like everywhere you go, you're making people laugh. You're having a good time. They're enjoying themselves and you feed yourself that way. That's fantastic. He goes, if you can do that to the day you die, do it because it's the best way to live. And I was, I remember like that totally makes sense. Like even if you're just a guy who never really makes it but can kind of headline enough to bring a good crowd, you know, and half, you know, half filled clubs all across the country, you're going to get by. Well you

Speaker 3:          01:45:46       made it, especially now with see these and tee shirts and hats and Yoyos. You don't have the opportunity now, Twitter and Twitter, youtube, even a low income, it could make, you know, so it guy that's not working the Improv per se. Okay. Let's say a guy that doesn't work the Improv's with a funny bones. There's a thousand clubs, there's still a lot of cloud of clothes, a lot of clubs at Ohio U, you know, Husky and then there's like the Austin Room and all those. But then there's an underbelly to that. They're going to open up another room in Tempe but listen to them. Yeah. And the spring. So that's who's going to open it. The people who won't, Rick Bronson's Comedy Club in Minneapolis in the old east orange. Wow. Uh, Easter. Other for that one at Tempe. So you have stand up live, you have the Tempe Improv, you have standup Scottsdale and you have the other one in Scottsdale. That's for holy shovel one night. And you have this place coming in. [inaudible] six rooms in the Arizona area outlined, well it's always been like a very comedy

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       town. You know, people that like to have fun and there's not a lot of options in the Tempe Improv is one of the best options in the area for the longest time. So you've got like a whole community that's been sort of raised on really good combat. Like that's always been an option. If you live in Tempe, that Improv is a big stop for a lot of guys. So like every week, you know you're going to get this guy who's a national headlight or Brian cow and Joey d if you're going to get that kind of comedy like almost every weekend. So they they, they really built up a big audience that I bet they can't even satisfy

Speaker 3:          01:47:21       Tempe called Dick Suckers are us. They got some Dick Sucking motherfucker. It's though they'll suck your dick wet or dry coked up just with a shot at Aspen. They will suck that pipe anywhere. There are some nasty cocksuckers down there. There's an organism I think pissed. Tell. Tell Brian about, take your time. Hurry up. It's amazing how down there is where the fucking women who love sucking cock for like one day they'd go, fuck it. Let's move to Arizona then this, everybody that result is hot and they suck Dick. Fuck it. And they really do. It's really a weird place. I cannot believe it anymore, but

Speaker 5:          01:48:01       what are you going to do? You know what I'm saying? What the fuck am I talking about? I have no idea. Is Anybody fucking though your movie comes out this week because this week and you got to actually go to New York and watch it. Did you enjoy it? Was it fun because this is your first time seeing it, edit it. I guess too. I taught two times last week. Yeah, but you liked it that much though. I saw it. I had no choice. You know what I'm saying? I it go with my wife and I went one night in New York. He likes seeing, you also met the guy that plays big pussy. Yes. And on the Sopranos, you know, ever since I've known you ever since I've known you, you get confused with this guy, you know and you eat and you usually don't even tell people. You're like, all right, get over here. And they're like, I love you. You know? I was like, yeah, whatever. Get out of here. You know? I tried to tell him like sometimes I ask people and they're like, they'll stop me in the UFC of those though.

Speaker 3:          01:48:50       Why are you the best? Was The lady who was asking me who I was like, oh, so you stopped me to take a picture. You don't know who the fuck I am. Fucking barrel cooler. Cocksuckers

Speaker 5:          01:48:59       okay. And you said that he also gets confused with you sometimes.

Speaker 3:          01:49:04       At least that that day he did it. It was nice. It was really nice to finally meet him. He gave me a big hug and oh his stat. Where did you do that? At the premiere of the movie. So we being art, we were walking. He kind of, he looks at me and he comes right over and he's like, man, what the fuck? He goes, I was just the bathroom. People asking me how much fun was it shoot with the there. And I kept telling him it wasn't made and here you are. So he was very nice. He was very nice to talk to. You know they're using you in the clip of you seen the trailer for smaller tray. All of them. They're using that one line. It's like bad Baywatch. The power of the Internet though. That's the strength of the Joe Rogan experience and the power of the motherfuck tell that story because that story is fucking hilarious story.

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       It's a crazy story. Like they had no idea who you were. They booked you because they thought you were funny. You go to the premiere and when your face is on the premiere. No, no, no, no. They shot the movie cause it director referred me, right. He goes, Joe was a hard shot. So they put me in the movie, but then they take the movie, they show it in the Midwest and all these places to see how it scores and where they showed it. They don't show no titles, no names, no nothing. And they give you a questionnaire and one of the guys. So when I was shooting a movie, everybody was very nice, but nobody really talked to me. Everybody had their Starbucks cup and nobody asked me if I wanted Starbucks. You know what I'm saying though, nobody asked me if I wanted to Starbucks, which I wouldn't have drank coffee, but Jesus Christ asked me.

Speaker 3:          01:50:28       But I was just a fucking regular guy. When they screened the films, I guess people started yelling, no blue cheese, go fuck your mother. I go, what the fuck is going on? And all of these reports came back. So they got it. So when I went to do the Adr, they will all, they're like, come in, you know, every hill comes out of jail. You broke it. Cherry weird. They didn't know who you were. They didn't know that, you know, this is big what we do here. That's why it's a fucking movement. They didn't know that. So once they find out they started liking my cigarettes and shit and rubbing my shoulders. Well if you think about what a a television show get, like the amount of people that watch a television show, like have a television shows on every week. How many people watch it?

Speaker 3:          01:51:13       What's a big one? A big ones. Like you know, like, like what does duck dynasty get? It's the height. The biggest ratings ever. Yeah. They crushed us when we were up against them on Scifi. It's like 14 million cable. It's not like the highest rate Keto that you will get more hits than fucking come out that show on Fx. I know that you guys were killing that show. We did very well on [inaudible]. Didn't have to come come up. The Joe Rogan podcast was getting more downloads than that come l bell on Fx. Did you know that you will get more downloads? There's people watching that shit that spike put on with Randy and everybody. No disrespect. You know, I love them in May that that show they had on for a while. You're talking about downloads, you're talking about ratings, downloads, podcast viewers. How many people would download and watching this or listening to a show, the show that fucking come out had on Fx, but you're not, you're not talking about the Scifi show.

Speaker 3:          01:52:04       You're talking about pod. Got The side of the fight strong. I'm talking about that more people watch this to not show more people watch this then that fucking series they had before. Glory on spike. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You follow what I'm saying? More people. It's amazing how many viewers, how many people watch. It's amazing how many places I go now that people hear the voice of God and show it is. I just heard you on the podcast the other day, man. It's amazing. And the people that will say that. Do you realize it or does it, is it one thing is it, did it creep up on you and it like takes you time to go holy shit. Like this is, this is actually getting kind of nutty. Like when did you realize it? When did you, when did you realize like the impact of doing stuff online? Year and a half ago, I really felt the Urbino

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       security people talking to me and they say people, Tsa people talking to me. You know, Tsa people talk to me now. Amen. How you doing? That was funny last time and you're right, what you said about the Mars program, whatever, how many people will say shit to me? You know, this is huge. This little movement is fucking huge. Where we're closing in on 8 million downloads a month and that doesn't include stitcher and that doesn't show you to reuse stream. Such a million crazy show close to. It's seven 50 and then whatever it is, it's a lot. It's a lot of individuals. That is, I don't know. That's a lot. That's a fucking lot. It's definitely not 8 million. I mean, I don't know how many admit it is. There's a lot of different people downloading it. Definitely killing half the TV shows on television. If they go by anybody's killing anything, you know, it's just a different thing.

Speaker 1:          01:53:32       It's just they didn't have it before. Before people were stuck, they were stuck with radio or they'd have to, you know, bring a cassette or you know, they listen to books on tape. That was like, you're only good option, but now they can do whatever the fuck they want. There's so much shit you get download, you listen to your podcast. This isn't a Dunkin's. You could download a a Dan Carlin podcasts and learn about some history. You could download us, you know, science podcasts he get, I mean, there's the numbers of podcasts now or just fucking staggering the options that a person has. That's why I keep telling people, you can't charge money for this. Like if you think you're going to get away with charging money, you're going to make a little bit money from the people you charge, but you're ultimately going to fuck yourself because it's going to slow your growth down.

Speaker 1:          01:54:13       Your, your growth is best achieved if you follow the spirit of the Internet. Spirit of the Internet is give people freak shit, give people free shit. That's good. And that way when you develop a relationship with them, you develop a relationship where you've already given them something like, you know, like you're not just constantly asking them to buy your tickets, constantly asking them to do this. It's a like a really easy free thing and you're happy that they enjoy it and you do it in a spirit of that. Not even in the spirit of trying to make money off of it. And then it's all sorts of falls into place. And that's what's happened with all of us up at four 45 of them. You're ridiculous. You do it in the weirdest way. I fucking love it. You just hurt Brian's feelings. I usually watch the first half.

Speaker 1:          01:54:55       I had a Texas motherfucker twice at noon. Tell him that the podcast is it too, like, oh, I could wake up with a pair of underwear across his face trying to find this mother fucker. Molly Dodd who said every night, yeah, he's going to die. I'm not going to make it. When I get up, listen to this. Some nights I go to bed or they like, when I come back on a Sunday, I'm dead five shows all weekend, you know, five hours a night. I fucking go to bed at fucking six this sudden nights I get up at three and I'm looking at your Instagram, so you're going to fucking pink dot. You're going to the other place. You'd take pictures of pancakes. You're living like we were living. You were living like essentially like we were living in the 90s yeah, it's, it's, it's a life of a comic.

Speaker 1:          01:55:39       It's the life of a comic. You know, you're going to bed as I'm getting up, you and Ari. Ari is fucking up all hours. He's a full savage. I looked at his Instagram the other day. I have photos of all the spots he's doing in town. This is mother fuckers don't like five, six bucks at night going all around New York from like eight, 8:00 PM on, you know, he's got spots. All he's at 1:00 AM spots at Caroline's and shit. He just going up. But he's, he's getting excited by it. Speaking of exciting this weekend, ladies and gentlemen at the Mirage, the greatest line up ever been to put together ever. Joey Diaz, Brian Cowen and Ari Shaffir, God damn. And me and uh, at the Mirage. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I don't even need to be there. So this show that's so fucking good. I can just just bring everybody up and say goodnight.

Speaker 1:          01:56:24       It'd be fucking beautiful. Yeah. My, I might just take the, no, I'm going to tell some jokes, but look, you can't, can't get a better lamp. No, we've never done a crazier show them that. That's the craziest show I've ever done for headliners. Everybody having a good time. It'll be sold out. It's almost sold out already. And it's at the Mirage at the Terry Fator. Uh, he, I guess he has his own theater there. I've never seen it before, but it's supposed to be a sweet, sweet room. We're gonna have a good fucking time. Joe. Just a room was in the fucking head. What's going on with the fight? This, I want you to go there man, but you're not going to be there. I know. No one knows. You know. Look, it's this, it's a crazy fight. Anderson Silva all time, greatest mixed martial artists that's ever lived.

Speaker 1:          01:57:01       I mean, he's got stellar his entire career dominating champions strangling Dan Henderson, knocking out veto over the fucking front kick to the face, the greatest martial artists that's ever walked the face here is a guy lives like he's in a fucking movie and he gets clipped. Boom, he gets hurt and a dude plays basketball with his head. Boom, boom, boom. And he's out and he, and he, you know, referee has to rescue him. And it all came about in large part due to him clowning. Well, what people don't realize is there was a moment in that first round where he had Anderson Silva really hurt and it was not when he was going for the heel hook, it was um, he was ground and pounding Anderson and he blasted him on the Chin and you see Anderson's head bounce off the ground. He realized like, Whoa, that is a fucking hard shot.

Speaker 1:          01:57:50       And he got clipped with, he got hurt, his eyes roll up and roll back. He got really rocked. And I think that severely influenced his decision to try to up the antics and really drag Weidman into a standup banner, which he thought he would have the advantage. But I think one of the reasons why he got clipped with that left hook and all that clown and around was because he got fucking hurt on the ground. And I think he really didn't want to go there. He almost got his leg ripped off. He got out of the leg lock and who knows if his knee popped, he could have easily popped his knee in that exchange was quite a, a deep leg lock. And then he goes from there and you know, he's trying to go to into a standup war and he's like, come on, stand up, stand up.

Speaker 1:          01:58:30       You know? And then he's kicking him and taunting him and pretending that he's hurt and drunk. But Weidman is just a motherfucker dude. And he clips him and knocks him out. So the question comes when you're coming into this fight, it's like, wow. Much different would the result have been if Anderson just treated it like a fucking Samurai, if he went in there with no antics and just laser beam precision striking chops, those legs up eventually lands a big head kick or something, you know, who knows? Who knows what would happen? We'll see this weekend while we won't even, because he didn't do it then. So who is he now and who is Weidman now? You know, the first fight is going to be one of the most mysterious fights ever. It's going to be one of the most hotly debated fights ever because everyone's always going to say, what would have happened if Anderson wasn't fucking around?

Speaker 1:          01:59:15       What would have happened if Anderson took that dude super serious and just stayed super disciplined in the feet and was able to just like in the sun and fight to get taken down the first round, but then keep the fight standing for the rest of the fight and then put them away. Who knows? We won't know. We don't know anymore, but we do know is that Chris Weidman knocked Anderson silver the fuck out and that's shocking. He's the greatest fighter of all time and Weidman clipped him with a fucking long left hook but bank right on the chin dropped him and then finished him off and he's going to be so confident coming into this fight. It was just going to be a really interesting fight because I think Anderson is going to be real confident cause Anderson knows that if he minds his p's and q's and keeps the fight standing, he should have a pretty distinct advantage as long as he doesn't do anything silly like the last time and then to Weidman is already beat him.

Speaker 1:          02:00:04       Weidman's already knocked him out. Weidman's gotten better. Weidman still young Weidman just had that Regena keen shit done on his knees. He went to Germany for a week to get his knees treated and apparently he's, he's got his whole workout. Like everything he does, you could do it online. Everything he does, he like, he, he, he, he puts it online so people can watch, puts up his diet, puts up his workout schedule, tells Anderson when it's, his strategy is, it doesn't give a fuck. Sadly, it's not gonna it's not gonna matter. I'm going to get them. It's a fascinating fight. It's fucking fascinating. I don't know what's going to happen, man. I have no idea if Anderson went out and knocked him out. I mean, yeah, that's a possibility. If Weidman took them down and submitted them, that's a possibility. Weidman knocked him out. That's a possibility.

Speaker 1:          02:00:45       What of Anderson Takes Weidman's back and submits him? Who the fuck knows? Man? That'd be a good, that's a wild fight. And it's for legacy too. For Anderson. This is for legacy. You know, Anderson suffered like that's a humiliating defeat and especially when he knows that there's a lot of people that blame it on his clowning, you know, that's like an for Brazil like Brazil got. There was a lot of times where he went to Brazil where you know, people were like disappointed he was their champion, not just the champion, but the greatest champion and he came from their country. There's a lot of, and he feels that disappointment and he wants to make them happy and this fight, I think this is going to be very intense. I'm fucking pumped. God. Yes. I wish you would give them the card Josh. Josh Barnett against. That's a good fight though, against Travis Travis Hoppa Brown.

Speaker 1:          02:01:35       Lots of very good Rhonda and Rhonda Rousey. Miesha Tate, Josh Barnett and Travis Browne is a dangerous fight. That's a tricky fight for both guys. King Kong that Travis Brown might be one of the toughest motherfuckers thought he's a big boy. He's six, seven. Travis Brown. I would say he's, if I had to guess, I would say he's at least six, five, six, six, six, five, somewhere around there. He's a big boy, but he's also, he moves good man. He moves light on its feet, striking Mr motherfucking Overeem's front kick to the face dude. And that was after taking a far road eating in that first round, he took a beating that would have stopped 99.999% of the people on the planet if they were in that position taking those kinds of shots. Alastar was murdering him with knees and there's nobody throws needs like Alister have you never seen Alistair Overeem fight?

Speaker 1:          02:02:28       Alistair Overeem was the k one Grand Prix champion and he's a super high level kickboxer for MMA. Like one of the most high level guys to ever fight in MMA in the heavyweight division, especially in that mother fucker delivers knees and a totally different way. It's all just hip and technique and torque and a lump. I mean those fucking knees go deep into your soul. They pass through your skin and push your fucking belly right into your backbone. Like they make your body go numb because he's literally smashing his knee all the way into your nerves. I mean, they're ruthless knees and his whole body gives out. He goes down and he's just getting fucking pound it and you thinking they're going to stop this fight any second now. And he figures out a way to get up and, and, and then Allister gets tired and then he gets up and Alistair is clearly exhausted because he's triangle head kicks.

Speaker 1:          02:03:17       Right. He kept throwing. Uh Huh. Right. I been that truck and he landed that one straight up the middle right to the chin and Alistair's legs give out and Travis finishes him off. It's one of the greatest comebacks. Was I to fight? It was supposed to be, uh, I don't know, but via got hurt. I don't know if he scheduled. Who's, uh, let me find out right now. Mia got hurt. Somebody got hurt. Yeah. I wonder. I wonder who he is supposed to be fighting next. I don't know. I don't know. Let me find that out. I'll find that out. Next fight. He's a guy that, uh, a lot of people thought he was going to, especially after the Brock Lesnar fight, a lot of people thought that he was going to be the fucking man. Oh, he's fighting Frank Mir. He's supposed to hard cheeses. UFC One 69, which is the super bowl.

Speaker 1:          02:04:09       Yeah, that's right. Wow, that's crazy fight man. Both guys got a lot to lose. Was on the super bowl card. It's a good question. I think it's Hanan Barao and Dominick Cruz is the main event that's a, that's a, that's going to be a big fight for the east coast. And still to this day, it can't be legal in New York. It's fucking crazy. It's one of the, the weirdest as far as like, uh, examples of how corruption shapes what people are allowed to enjoy and not a joy. It's a, they figured out a way to keep the UFC Adam, New York, despite a giant hit to the economy. I mean, they take money. They're taking money away from New York by not letting it come to New York. It would, it would bring hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to restaurants and local bars. And I mean, the, the impact would be huge. The Prestige would be huge.

Speaker 1:          02:05:03       People would love to see it and they still, they have, it's not like they don't have combat sports. They have boxing regularly in New York. They have kickboxing, they've had glory in New York. They had glory high, you know, high level kickboxing and Madison Square Garden. It's amazing. These motherfuckers, they're there, they're figuring out a way to keep people from enjoying what they want. But you know what, man, there's always going to be that. This is always going to be, that there's always going to be people that are trying to make money off of something. If for folks who don't even know what it's all about, the culinary union keeps the UFC out of New York and they know that it's a big event for New York. Um, but they want the UFC. UFC is owned by Zoomba and zoo for also own station casinos, same guys. And they want them to go union to Culinary Union wants those, those hotels to go union.

Speaker 1:          02:05:49       So they're taking all their dues and they're, they're battling the UFC hardcore. They develop these like crazy websites. They contact gay and lesbian groups. They do everything they can to try to like make a big force against the UFC. The crazy thing is they contact gay and lesbian groups, but the UFC is like they, they're openly in support of gay and lesbian rights. They actually donate money to the various centers and the UFC is like totally open minded firefighters. Fighters had been reprimanded for you know, calling people gay slurs and things along those lines. Then they're not, you know, the culinary union is just trying to figure out a way to get the UFC. It's amazing because if they did it, but if they did, if they switched over union, it would be worth millions of dollars to the union. It's kind of fascinating stuff because on one hand you go, well, you know, unions are important.

Speaker 1:          02:06:33       If a guy wants to earn a good wage and you want to make sure that they have some leverage and buying power and people should get paid. But when you see shit like this, like how could this be right? Like you, you, the people that worked for those casinos voted against doing the union thing. The whole thing is a mess. It's just like, it's just conti corruption. And it's gotten to the point where you're like, they can't back down. Now they've been spending money trying to keep the UFC out for so long, but you just putting your finger on a dike and there's a, there's a hole in that, in that, in that fucking dam and more holes are going to start popping up and eventually it's just going to overwhelm you. You're still spending all these, it'd be insane. It'd be the same. They're still spending all this union.

Speaker 1:          02:07:12       Dude's trying to keep it out. You know, it's just so unfortunate were shit like that happens with two things. Get entangled, you know, businesses getting tangled. So this, uh, the card in UFC in New Jersey's is a sick fucking card. It's Dominick Cruz, Hanan Barao, which is cruise had been out for two years, man with two different knee surgeries. One Cadaver ACL graft that blew out on him. His body rejected it, and then you had to go back in again, another nine months of Rehab and then three months of training so it loses on ball shots. He loses a year. Fucking incredible. So he's finally back fight in the interim champion and Barao. And then you've got Joe say Aldo Fighting Ricardo Lamas. That's a great fucking fight then. And then you got me. Or versus Overeem. There's a lot of good fights to Linacre versus bag routine off these two little flyweight murderers.

Speaker 1:          02:08:04       Oh, those two killers, man. PAGO teen offers a Samo champion. This Linacre is a destroyer. The calls him, they call him hands of stone. You can't do that, right? It's her to the ranch. Shit, he can't take shit, but the kid can't fucking bang man. He's got ridiculous, ridiculous power. Bobby Greens fight enabled to Hilo. God Damn it. A lot of good fights, man. A lot of good fights. It's going to be crazy too because getting a back and forth, apparently you're saying it's going to be a real issue. Well those guys are going to be in Jersey. Yeah, but you're saying getting back and forth to crazy times so it's not that bad. Yeah. But going back and forth that weekend is going to be nutty. What is it going to be like that that weekend? What is it like?

Speaker 3:          02:08:49       Okay, so you have three titles, right? The Lincoln tunnel side. You have the George Washington bridge, upper and lower, and you have the Holland tunnel, right? Plus you have the fairies. When you do a super bowl, you have the soup bowl or one location. So when you go to, uh, let's say they're going to have it up and uh, the rose bowl, everything around the rose bowl will be NFL related for the first two weeks. The first week is press week. The last week of the playoffs, I think it's either a two week situation to get you to spend more money or it's a one week. So you go right for the playoffs, right to the soup bowl. They come into town the week before and start practicing and all that shit. It's not the 18,000 to 20,000 people that come to the super bowl. It's the hundred thousand people like a couple of years ago. Real sport time exposition on how many hookers fly in for Superbowls.

Speaker 3:          02:09:40       You'd be fucking blown away. It seems like a good move. I was a hooker. No, they had a whole 20 minutes. I'll have three segments dedicated to the art of hooking all fucking super bowl, the HBO, Hbo at what happened, what really happens to a city when they have the soup bowl in your city? That was the expert say wow. For starters, 20 million kilos of coke at shot at 20 million. Oh, you know they, people come to the zoo board apart and so it's not the 18,000 to go to the game. It's the hundred thousand that come in. So now this is, let's pretend you're going to have the Superbowl in San Francisco. Everything around that stadium is, it's going to be related to the super bowl. They're not doing that this time that do it. All the NFL experiences and shit scattered throughout New York City. So if you want to see the NFL experience hall of fame, you got to go to the Museum of natural history.

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       If you want to see the NFL quarterback challenge, you've got to go downtown. That's going to create all that shit that dementia. There's a lot of things going on. There's a lot there. Not, as I mentioned, they're closing the Lincoln tunnel. One tunnel is only for buses, social, it'd be one community thing. Now our boy Alex, we'll get you back and forth. The other thing I do not like it all is it's February fucking third and fourth could snow, could snow and they said it hasn't snowed in February in 80 years. You know what that means? It's going to fucking snow in February. I said in the, in the, uh, super bowl in that area in Newark. It hasn't stone in February and 80 years old lesson. Is that true? No. Come on. No, that's not true. What am I? Am I quitting? Birthday's February 19th and my mother used to take pictures every year of be walking into the bar on February 19th at one thing for certain.

Speaker 3:          02:11:23       There's always snow on the fucking ground. Let me see what it, maybe it's that day. Let me see where they're, what they're saying. Farmer's Almanac, a big storm. The farmer's Almanac is predicting how dare they, the temperature. That's hilarious. Temperature reached 71 yesterday where? New York. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's warm right now. Sure. That's incredible. Yeah. Yeah. It was warmer than it is here. Yeah. It doesn't even make any sense. Yeah. They said it's unseasonably warm. Okay. February 2nd in New York, and this is true February 2nd in Newark. Hasn't seen serious now in 80 years. Wow. Yeah, so it is true.

Speaker 3:          02:12:02       Yeah. So it's that day. It's that specific day. 80 years. They asked Roger, good, that doesn't mean shit. Last week, and they asked Roger, get down, what are you, what are you doing for the possibilities is no. He said, you know what? If it snows one to have ourselves an old fashioned soup bowl, that would be awesome. I would like that. No banging up, but you're out of that. By the time the super bowl even was the kickoff, you're in La with your feet getting a massage because, well I'm going to watch it. I'm going to watch it this year. Try to figure out what, Yay. I'm not going there. No. Where else would your feet up? Eating fucking a meatball sandwich or something because if not, I want to find out what the fucking hype is all about. And I think if I, if I watched them play in the snow, I'll really enjoy it.

Speaker 3:          02:12:44       Well cause this is madness. You know, I love chaos. If you can get, if they could have MMA fights in the snow and you ever seen a wet and wild, you ever seen the Kandak cage wet and wild? No. The king of the cage is a smaller organization in Hawaii, right? No, no, no, no, no. California. They used to have, um, my friend bud used to own part of it and uh, they used to have these Emmett, where the fuck is that? Look at that last weekend. Where are they flying? That's crazy. That is so gangster playing a game and the snow like that. I don't give a fuck that is Uber gangster and to see that there's 18,000 people in the audience, go to that audience shot. Look at that. Look at those mother fuckers. They're freezing their dicks off and they're still there. They're all there.

Speaker 3:          02:13:26       Fuck. I love that. I love that they're willing to play in the snow that it stays so wicked. How the technology has changed because now like the size of it, the sidelines are all heated. The seats, a heated throw blankets at either the heated the gloves, eat it. It's amazing what I'm fucking cold getting hit in the cold it. What's that? American Express commercial then a $66 a blowjob. Priceless. Priceless. Getting hit in the fucking snow when it's called prices for competent, like warm as you got to look in that camera, man. Yeah, earning his money, man. Jesus Christ. That's insane. Yeah. I get that. East Coast man. It gets rough. Look at that. I'll tell you what, when I went deer hunting recently, we went to Wisconsin for that show, meat eater, and we sat in a blind, a deer blind waiting, and you're sitting in that fucking blind and it is zero degrees outside and the wind is whipping and you are fucking cold.

Speaker 3:          02:14:24       You know why? Shit, cause you're just sitting, you're not moving. It's one thing if you're moving, like I've been in zero before, but if you keep moving when you're in zero, you're okay. As long as you keep moving, you generate some body heat. But when you're just sitting there waiting for a deer to shop, you can't. The fucking statute, you can't move. You just get to sit there. It's fucking rough, man. Wisconsin in the winter up near those fucking lakes. But God damn, they're deer everywhere. They're everywhere. You know what's crazy? We're not used to it. No. Were pussies. We're soft to east coast at night one night and it started snowing. I wasn't crying. I wasn't to the point, but about you to it. I see. I didn't say nothing. I was, you know, I was, I had shit on. But it's fucking cold. That's a different, I was in Eugene, Oregon with my bedtime.

Speaker 3:          02:15:13       Sequoia was nine below zero. Fucking rare. Rare cold snap. All right. You know, and you're like, wow, I forgot about this. They had some serious snow while you guys are up there. This is cool to do for 10 minutes to walk and get a Starbucks or something. Yeah, we got to go to Portland again. Let's do Portland and Portland together. Let's do it. Let's, okay, we'll do Portland again. Then we'll do New Mexico together. Let's do a Portland, New Mexico this weekend. Dirty bitches. We're going to be there this weekend at the Mirage though. I'm going to have some fun. What are you doing? New Years? Three years. I got an early show. We're at the early show, Jon Lovitz. Ah, okay. Early show up there and then I'm all for, I dunno how late I'll be up there, but it's a Paki shouldn't be weird. Like, I forget how fucking crazy the parking is for new year's everywhere.

Speaker 3:          02:15:56       If you get to the, if you get to the Improv and time man, if you want to go up, you're starting at 10 though. Yeah, we're starting to get out of there till about 10 that's why I didn't know for sure. Just drive over. Just try cause it's triple. He's going to go up and then Tony Hinchcliffe can go up to be to get out of there. I don't know. I never been lived before. New years so you know we can always ring in the new year and then you know you can go up after that too. It doesn't matter. We'll have some fun. I'll tell you something. Joe Rogan. I haven't been catching up on sleep or last two weeks have you? I fucking six weeks in a row on the road. That's a tough morning radio as well. That's no grown in radio to what they do.

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       The death squad people. That's why people, they give us a little percentage and they put it all on us. They put everything on ice. They figure Twitter. I see who goes in the week before and they get three stations. Don't call us and say, come in Wednesday for Thursday radio. I got nothing for us because they don't even spend a dime on these fucking clubs when we come in and not more than a dime, that guts because they put it all on us. They think we're going to go in there from the fucking podcast and impact of play. Well, in a lot of ways, like you said, it is like being on TV shows at the same time. So it's the same thing and the word gets out in a better way. And we do all our promoted. There's no radio. How many radio stations you got left in the worst?

Speaker 3:          02:17:08       Not, not for radio station that used not to promote something happy. The guy in that opie and Anthony Stern, who else is left? There's some stuff on the bottom. Tom, there's a, there's guys, uh, throughout the country that she could do. If you guys in Austin, there's this guy's, you know, Dale Dudley Day on Bob Bob's the people in Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale. Yep. Dama, wherever his buddies, I had to do like radio for the movie and I had a call a couple of places. I was surprised that, but it's all serious. You know I had a called BC at all serious. It's different affiliates. It wasn't like in the old days when we'd go to Houston, you did radio Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Friday. The drive through. What happened to those guys? Did Dee, did radio get fucked up by those jack channels and all those like preprogram channels? What's the big communism station? Communism. Clear Channel, which me just, that's it. It was communism. They were firing people for saying they got mad at, what's his name? What's the kid that had the chef Frank Caliendo. They got mad. Don't even say fuck that kid that maybe has a fucking his life, man, I don't know. But years ago something happened at some clear channel. He did the personalization. They thought it was off color. You know those people in self fucking easily man.

Speaker 1:          02:18:21       Well, they're just thinking about money. They're not. They're not. It's kind of funny that you're, you're selling art, but you're just thinking about money. Like that's a real hard line to dance. You're going to make sure that your product sucks because your product is never going to have any edges to it. It's not going to be anything dangerous about it. There's not going to mean anything controversial about it. Can you imagine if we could have a radio show where we do like this? We have a morning radio show and it's like this completely uncensored and it's on, you know, drive time, whatever. Just take this. Why, why you, why you have a, you know, some, some other nonsense on, just take this and if you need to throw a little beep in there, throw a little beep.

Speaker 3:          02:18:57       It's gotta be real people ready for this. Listen to this society. People were ready for this.

Speaker 1:          02:19:02       Well, you know what they're going to be ready for is having the Internet on their fucking radio. The Internet is going to be in your car. You're just going to download them, watch them or stream them live.

Speaker 3:          02:19:10       Joe, how many times can you get here? Hey Joe. So what are you thinking this weekend? Are you going to the race track? Yes we are. We're going to go. Nobody wants to hear that no more. We've gone through that. 1980 is fucking done. Okay, so nobody wants to hear that shit. You want to hear that shit? Maybe that's a suit, but I want to hear somebody who's telling me to fuck him. The truth for a lot. I want to hear somebody who's telling me their fucking mind, not what the advertisers are. Fucking tell them what they could say and what they can't say that that's the beauty about fucking podcast. That is the beauty. That's the beauty. But I don't give a fuck. You don't want to sponsor? I don't give a fuck. We get our word out. This is pirate radio to the grass roots as grassroots. As a kick fucking be.

Speaker 1:          02:19:50       Yeah. This is crazy. Pirate radios has ever been before. Even greater radio was getting. This is good as your fucking pirate radio wishes. It was the internet. I love doing this shit with a joint in my mouth. What did he do? That shit. I love all that shit. Well, if you stop and think about it, like from the moment we started doing this, all of us, everybody who does it now, all of us already and Brian and you know, calen and every, everybody who's been doing this, we put just, just doing it to do it. You know? We just started off doing it for fun. You know, we started off doing it like as a goof. So the intention was never as a business, the intention was to make it as fun as possible and to make it as, as, as enjoyable to listen to as possible to create.

Speaker 1:          02:20:30       And it becomes sort of like a piece that you're creating. It doesn't, it's not like a, it is like you're having a conversation, but when you're aware that other people are listening and you, you know, you want to make sure that it's, this is an entertaining, that there's something to this. You're, you're, you're like, you're fashioning a piece, you know? And that's a lot of what you're doing when you creating a podcast. It's a piece of art. It's a piece. I mean, it's very pretentious to call it art, but it's something that you're creating and that's something you realize along the way. That's

Speaker 3:          02:21:00       all it is, is there's no difference. We're going on there and we're given you what's in the heart and what's in our head. What sticks out of our mind. I don't fucking go on you. I don't go on Yahoo and see what the hot topic isn't talking about it. Anybody can do that. Anybody can do that. I don't want to talk about that shit. I want to talk about what pertains to us today. I don't. I don't go on there and talk about Obama care. What do I give a fuck a fuck? You guys bought that Hook. He's a fucking president. Why are you buying insurance from this shit? I'm not saying the president is shit, but why are you getting caught up and I know everybody needs a shirt, but I'm not going to go in there and talking about generalizations of sports. I don't want to do that.

Speaker 3:          02:21:37       I'm sick of doing that. How many times have you watched the news? You have three TVs in your house. Put them together one day and put the news on it. Fucking synchronized. They're synchronized. Show what they're talking about on four they're talking about on a five at the same time. Then Diane Sawyer comes on and world news tonight comes on and then there's another person. There's an interpretation of world news tonight with Diane Sawyer on four and I'm too, and that covered the same shit that you're covering to the minute because they want to get it to you before anybody else gets it to you. Right? So we go live now. You know it's the same shit when you wake up in the morning. You guys aren't end up in the morning. You're got to get up at six and watch TV in the morning and see what, how bad they get you going in the morning and the fear they put in you.

Speaker 3:          02:22:22       Just that all, they talk about it as teachers rape in a kid. This happened overnight and this nothing's positive. Nothing. By the time you get in your car, if you have any feeling at all, you fucking shock. That's why I get up at four 45 and I smoked dope. Then I get on Twitter and I play fucking music because let's get the fuck. Let's get our head away from that shit. Who gives a fuck? You still gotta get up. You know whether Obama Care's alive and kicking. When you go to rouse, there's anybody pop up and pay for your bills at routes or whatever. Wherever the fuck are you do shopping and you read Ben? No. All right then what the fuck are real question. When you were at Ralph's, nobody pops up in the face, but you know, of course they don't show it. Yeah. So what the fuck? Wah. I don't worry about that shit no more. You worry about your own path and what you can do and how you can help your community and your, some of the people running and you move forward and if you're not doing that then what the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 1:          02:23:11       Well there's a lot of people that are, are, are not doing that, but they are involved in the political part of it. It's like you can't, I don't think you can do everything. It becomes a problem if you really want to concentrate on fixing the economic system and fix the system. I'm only here for a short time. You, you're running up hill, that's for sure. But that's a lot of people say that's a cop out because that's the world that you live in and this is the, the society you're supposed to help it enhance it. You want to solve the world, you go do it. All I'm doing is putting you in a good mood for you to go to fuck out thing and get out there and kick some fucking ass. You know, I'm a fucking this morning and I was talking to my wife and she goes, you're a scaffold.

Speaker 1:          02:23:43       You know the other thing I would go to the ice house cause I was scared to go out at night. Why? I don't know. Because you eat edibles. That would kill a fucking whore. I don't know. Sometimes he'd edibles. Thompson girl came on. It was telling a story about you giving him a Chiba chew and about you ate like three or four of them. You got, you had lately like he ate a quarter of it and you had literally eight times as much in your system on the airplane was fuck yeah. He was telling me the whole story about it and I was like that. That's one of the most terrifying. So just thinking about you that high on an airplane, like you're having anxiety attacks. I was breathing heavy, I was starting to sweat and just suck and that's fucking really high man. What are you getting out of that? Like what's walking out of that? I love walking on that. No, that they would sugar, right? Either a whole cheat but you, but it was a 17

Speaker 3:          02:24:28       milligrams. It was a Greenwood. I start my day with a double a one 70 how am I going to do 70 ain't gonna do nothing. So I gotta pop two of them and that's one 40

Speaker 1:          02:24:38       and the third one is two 10 so I'm in range, mid range. That's how I am saying the amount of tolerance that the average person, the the length of time they would have to indulge in marijuana to hit that kind of tolerance.

Speaker 5:          02:24:52       That shit that Jerry [inaudible] was just talking about about all those local news. I don't know if you saw a Conan O'brien. He did a thing last week. It was brilliant where he took all these local news channels and showed how exactly generic they are reporting on the same story and they edit it together. If you want to. I have it right here. Yeah, sure. Makes Sense. It's so funny. Check this out. Even bigger story that's sweeping the nation right now. Who are you really shopping for this holiday season? It's okay. You can admit it if you an item or two

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       or 10 for yourself.

Okay, and can it fun for yourself? Is it okay? You can admit it. Oh my God, this is insane. It's still going. Joey. Joey went to take a leak. Nobody has a fucking, so

Speaker 3:          02:26:47       do you guys think this works? You think that there's like some sort of a grand script that goes out over the airwaves. They get these generic packets from there that, you know, like NBC and stuff like that. They could change the wording, but most days they do not. I do not. Yeah, they're probably lazy as fuck. You have no idea what we get coached. And you have to realize that for years when you were growing up, when you were young, you always heard that cliche. The media controls everything. Well they fucking, they could then they'll control everything. They control what they want you to hear. Right. It's control what they want you to hear. You can't shoot a fucking BB gun now without the whole country finding 10 fucking seconds. They will interrupt the fucking orgy. Now you poured out a kid got shot in New Orleans by a, I'm sorry.

Speaker 3:          02:27:33       Oh No, I'm sorry. All right, look, somebody fall over there. Ah, what are you doing? He's showing me gross. Oh Jamie don't distract conversation. No, no, no. Ah, and that's the thing. They, they, they, so I just don't have a second conversation. Those conversation and he think that we're doing now is because people eventually just got, I mean, how many times? I don't mean to put anybody down. You Watch a Sitcom lately? No, it's painful. There are that aren't anything. They're like fucking everything on two for Fox and whatever. They're all the same. Just rewritten over and over and over again and there's some nights it's like going to the main room. Carlos is on doing dices joke at. He's in the original room. Remember that Shit that

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       night? Somebody was saying that just one of the original omen calls is doing decisive Joe. He just did dices dice. Did the joke in the original room. Carlos did the same joke in the main room one night. This was the, but I'm not talking. It's the same thing with ta and that's, this is why this shit's winning. This is why more people are turning into this. First of all, I know this is this is it mean podcasts. These podcasts, we do them, we put them up, they run out of the TV shows, operate under where they interrupt things every 15 minutes. That's it that I watched the walking dead. You know when you get it on Apple TV, you can't get it the night it comes out on TV. So it was out on Sunday. So I decided to watch it on regular TV in real time and it was fucking brutal.

Speaker 1:          02:29:04       They just cab having commercial after commercial after commercial, they kept throwing commercials up. It was fucking crazy. I was like this is gross. It's such a terrible way to watch an hour program. We have so many different options now with podcasts and people jumping on going on like this. You know when I watch Jay Leno and I may, I may like the guy from pirates of the Caribbean. What's his name? Listen, Jay Leno, if he was smart, he would host a show on cars. That's a no, no. I'm just saying what's the guy that goes on in there? What's the guy who was Johnny Depp? We all like Johnny Depp. I love Johnny Depp. Ain't gonna go on. They'll actually promoting the movie. I aint promoting nothing. I'm here talking to you. So every, so tell us about what happened that time you were shooting on the set. I did my own stunts.

Speaker 1:          02:29:52       Get the fuck out of my face. You'll fucking half a fag fucking Scott's I right. You know it's the same shit. So eventually some people said fuck it, we can't do this no more. These things to me are interesting in shit. I listen to podcasts. Yes. The different assortment of educational podcasts. I try me to the history one is fucking great by the way, cause I'm a history reading. Uh, and they're very interesting. And even when you're doing the podcasts, he listens to one that's educational. It's not calming. You're like, wow, I like how they're doing that. As you heard radio lab, you ever heard of Radiolab? Radiolab is really good. It's um, it's interesting too because they add in sound effects. They like tell a story and they edit it really well. They'll do an interview and they'll explain things as the interview is going on.

Speaker 1:          02:30:35       Like they intersect a narrator explaining things as they're going on with a cool sound effects and shit. It's like really well produced. So like they have a premise like one of the premises was why are these athletes from this one particular era in Africa, why are they such good runners? Like what is it about these guys that make them good runners? And then during the whole show they'd speak to experts to talk about it and then they ultimately speak to a guy who was born and raised in that tribe and he explains what it is. It's a combination of factors, but one of them being is brutal circumcision thing that these guys have to go through unbelievably brutal rites of passage to become a man when they're circumcised you with a sharp stick, they make you crawl naked through thorns. Like it's like really hardcore

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       shit. Like what they make these people do, they make the, they make them run like on a regular basis while their dick is like twisted up. Like they have their four skin tied up in a bow and they're, they're running naked. When they get outside the, uh, the hot, they also have, they have to run, they can't walk anywhere, like incredible rites of passage to become a man that is so brutal that they get through this and they have this insane tolerance for pain and they have this genetic predisposition to be good runners, like the way their bodies shaped and built. Fascinating stuff. So listening to it on this podcast made me appreciate like that style of podcasting. It's an is, it's a different style obviously then we do, but I like that, you know, everybody's got to be creative now with this thing. People were sick and tired of it, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:32:05       Listen, I've said for years I've said that. And I normally, the soap people, I don't know who fucking stays up and watches those talk shows later than flipping through the channels. I don't fucking know why this Dalon half the fucking time. I don't fucking know who watches that shit on a fucking and now you got sad. And I live with now they've got to put stars on every week to make it work. Every fucking week. They've got to put somebody famous. Now I get home on Saturday from doing something and it's Miley Cyrus, Justin Timberlake, and Paul Rudd. Got It. No, last week was the other guy. What the fuck did you, what happened to the regular fucking sign that live cast that nobody watches that shit. So you have to have those fucking people on there now. But that's amazing. Who Watches late night talk show? Who the fuck tolerates that shit?

Speaker 3:          02:32:47       You do chemo but looks at that fucking Conan clip was great. I'll Kona Kona. It's not at nine o'clock. What time is here here? It's eight o'clock nine o'clock and Pete home comes on at 10 I watched Kodak. I'm talking about 11 fucking third Pete Holmes show. I've never watched the beginning of a couple of minutes there as he doing the same standard thing like monologue in the beginning. And then I think he turned to his is like a podcast show also. Eric, I haven't watched the whole thing. My friend watched it. He's on um, after Kona. Is that what it is? Yes. That's all I have to call it. And then there's Craig Ferguson still does pretty no fucking watch that shit that with the fucking morning. I don't watch the other guy, Jay Leno kill me fucking day. Every once in a while. I still got a hot out from my main man, Dave Letterman.

Speaker 3:          02:33:32       That's my dog. That's all I watch him. If he's got somebody cool. I know he's got a goof on him or something. He's still an interesting guy. He's very interesting. I've, oh, I loved him since 80 fucking too. I've been watching David. You know where you get to really see an interesting side of him. He's in a comedians getting in cars, getting coffee. You know that web series, the Jerry Seinfeld did. Have you seen that one with David Letterman? Yeah. It's really interesting because he has a Volvo that he drives around and it's crazy. Souped up Volvo and a, someone famous called them up like, who was it? Who was it that wanted to know if he wanted one of those? Volvo's some, some other crazy fucker, some other crazy famous fucker. Forget, I forget who it was, but someone, uh,

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       said, hey, I'm a, I'm buying these souped up Volvo, so you want one? He's like, fuck it. Count me in. So he got this Volvo with a six speed and like a fucking ridiculous high horsepower engine. Looks like a crazy, like a regular wagon. You know that you would drive around in, but it's, it's brutal. Click on that shit. You see can see what it is. That's a big time. Bold the car too. Yeah. Oh, that's an ad, right? Is that an ad? That was, they just, they get show those fucking 15 second ads. I liked the skip ad option or like, are they doing that skip back in five seconds? Yeah. You got to get me quick. You've got to get me quick. Yeah. This is a Volvo. He's got a Volvo wagon.

Speaker 6:          02:35:04       This is the 1995 Volvo nine 60 station wagon. Oh my God. Really? It is in region bread. It has a black leather interior, premium sound system and a sunroof, but it was built with the high performance racing engine by none other than Paul Newman. It's a lady horsepower Ford v eight with a supercharger and a Mustang, five speed gearbox. It looks like the kind of car that you would take to a place like this and do things like this, but it's actually a car where you can do things like this. He's doing a burnout. Oh, how rude.

Speaker 1:          02:35:50       Anyway, that's an interesting web series. So He's another one like Jerry Seinfeld. Like I like him in that more than I even like him doing stand up. Like he's really good at that cause he loves fucking cars that guys addicted to car. Should we Seinfeld, he's a huge Porsche owner. Like he owns like some insane amount of Porsche's. I mean I think he's got like, like, like huge garages that he owns that are dedicated to these cars is actually a at an airport in senate. Yeah, but not just here. Also on the east coast as well. He's got a separate one set up over there and he has a full time mechanic that takes care of all of this stuff. This is like, they're just constantly working on his car. Like he has like rare cars are worth like 1 million bucks, like rare first edition, you know, 1973 nine 11 at rs cars are super hard to get ahold of.

Speaker 1:          02:36:41       He's a car nut. So like Jay Leno too, like one at Jay Leno's best things that he does is Jay Leno's garage. It's a thing that he does online and it's, it's, I like it better than the tonight show because the fucking guy loves cars. I mean, he's in love with everything and not just fast cars. He's got a bunch of old stupid cars. I don't like these crazy like 1910 fucking shit boxes that he's got rebuilt and he, he drives around in them. Is this Jerry Seinfeld's place? Yeah, just layered. Yeah. He's got like all kinds of cars. Mostly Porsches, but obviously you could see there he's got a Chevy Camaro. Ss. Vw Bug. Yeah. He's got a fuck load of cars, man. He loves him. I mean, Hey, you know, people are in a weird shit. Some guys are in the steroids or the guys are in a guns.

Speaker 1:          02:37:28       Jerry Seinfeld's in a car. Fuck it. Get that Cadillac though. Joey, do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Let's let your wife drive the Subaru. No, she has the fuck Cadillac or that fucking gangster. He has the one that I want to say a silver one. Two. You need one that looks like it was fake shit. That wasn't the call of the year last year. Everybody got what does die? Hondai oh the um, the one that looks like a Mercedes. Yeah, she's got that. Those are supposed to be great. Somebody told me those cars are fucking great. This guy who knows cars told me look, the difference between that and then Alexis, it's a barely evident. He's like, yeah, the Lexus is a little bit sharper. It's a little bit like higher tolerances. It's a little bit better designed, a little bit more high end, but not that much.

Speaker 1:          02:38:10       He's like that fucking car. The one that looks like a Mercedes and Hyundai Manx he goes like that is like the bargain fucking car the year. That's a fucking gun to great car. I've done 80 just, I did 110 coming back from San Diego one night. Like nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Yeah. I have a friend of mine is Korean and he was just like, he was a doctor and he was always talking about like Korean work ethic and like, he's like, you don't know man. He goes, when these guys make a car, it's like, oh, cause it was when Hyundai was first coming out. I was like in the 1980s yeah. And he was like, listen man, these cars are going to be good. Yeah. A $4,000 car that went ballistic. They were great. I knew salesmen selling Hyundai's making $20,000 a month on $400 commissions. That's how many fucking holidays that we're selling amongst all those little four doors.

Speaker 1:          02:38:58       It's called, I forget the Hyundai still are super cheap. They were relying on, they went away for a while and they came back with all new thing. Yeah. And you know it's like Mitsubishi, like I've always said there's a Mitsubishi part and every fucking car. Mitsubishi has shit every fucking car. A lot of, what's the well set? What did Mitsubishi built? They built the plane that drove people crazy. A world did this. Mitsubishi built the mic. That's why a lot of old time people won't buy fucking heavy cars with Mitsubishi. Chrysler. Chrysler had Mitsubishi Products and there are a lot of people and these Sundays are expensive down this [inaudible] e Q. U u s equity is $60,000 zero they ain't fuck. Yeah Dude. But when you look at it, it's like $120,000 Mercedes. It's a dope fucking car man. And you know the Hyundai and lunch room, you know it's a ball.

Speaker 1:          02:39:54       It's a ballsy move to, if you've got some money and you buy a Hyundai, like you don't want to pitch. This is good enough. This is all I need is the opposite of the Cadillac move. It's the ANTIFA loss. Where was it looking at it right now. Which car? Which one is the echo? E? Q. U. U. S. E. Q. U. U. S. Yeah. $61,000 man. That's not cheap. That's what it starts at the hale. Yeah, but it's a rock solid car in comparison to the like the high end Lexus, like what's the high end Lexis? Let's say hi and Lexus, Lexus ls four. He's 4,600 it starts off at 71 so it's like not that much of a savings and a Mercedes Benz s five five zero is yeah, they're comparing them right there. The ultimate, so the equities ultimate is 68,000 and the Lexus ls four six 60 starts at 71,000. That Alexis is a motherfucker dude.

Speaker 1:          02:40:59       Those Japanese, those designers and engineers that they have that uh, worked for Toyota and then went into Lexis and made the high end Lexis. I had a Lexus truck. I still miss that truck. Really? Yeah. At least it at least did. And I was a, I brought it with me to Colorado. I missed that fucking truck. It was perfect. It was one of those big ones. I think it's called the LX. The SUV got, damn that thing was good. It was just rock solid the way it handled in like snowy weather and the use, the way it drove, even though it was a big car, like all the, all these systems that were designed to stabilize at around corners and stuff and you know, is adjustable suspension. Fascinating stuff man. And they're the ls, which is their big flagship. That's the one that's their, uh, they're big, uh, you know, they're big sedan.

Speaker 1:          02:41:48       That thing is the first car to parks itself. It parallel parks itself and they like it finds the spots. Have you ever seen that? Yeah. Ford has that. Awesome. They just it at all. Yeah. Yeah. I would trust the, what has the braking system to Alexis, right? Well, they have a lot of braking systems. There's a lot of different cards you're talking about with cruise control. I don't know which curves. It's like that smart cruise control. Yeah. Yeah. But there are also, uh, there's things that recognize even when you're not on cruise control, they apply the brakes. If you're getting too close to cars. This car right here. I was like that lane departure warning where it tells you if you'd like to go over in a lane. Yeah, that's fascinating. I have that on my SUV and it also, uh, we'll slow down if there's a car in front of you.

Speaker 1:          02:42:34       It's like a laser guided cruise control. So say you get on the highway, you say, okay, I'd like to go 70 miles an hour. Well, if there's a bunch of traffic, it slows you down to like whatever. The traffic's going like 40. And you don't even have to put your foot on the brake. It slows you down, man. You have to put your foot on the break of everything gets dead stopped. But then when the traffic picks up, it'll pick up. So it'll go back from 40 back to 60, back to 70. That's amazing. They came up with a new Mercedes that drives itself, man. They were reporting about it in the Frankfurt auto show. The newest auto show is this guy, Chris Harris. I always follow, uh, uh, he's a really funny automotive journalists. But, uh, he was, uh, there at the auto show and they were talking about this new car that literally you're gonna be able to sit in and it's going to follow the curve of the road.

Speaker 1:          02:43:16       It's going to break. It's gonna accelerate, decelerate it, do like virtually everything that a person does. So they're, they're super close to that kind of Google technology from more than one source. I know the Google car has been real successful. They have a car that drives itself and hasn't gotten into any fucking accidents and a certain point in time it's going to be like, why would, why should we let people drive he fucking dummies. You crash into each other if you, if nobody drives ever, you just getting your thing and you press the button, there's never going to be a crash again. Isn't that better? That seems, I mean, I know that it's nice to be able to drive it. I like driving and I know you like driving, but wouldn't it be better if we knew that no one that you love would ever die in an automobile accident again? And that's how it begins. Joey Diaz. That's how they take away your freedom and that's how skynet goes live. And it's all coming through Google coincidence. They just bought the fucking robot company, Joey. They bought that Boston dynamics. They're making fucking robot frogs and shit. Robot Cheetahs. What's next? Joey Diaz? Friday night, the Mirage Friday night. Ari should fear Brian Cowen, Joey Diaz. Um, anything else coming on? Brian? I know you got to get a gang shit going on in Texas, right?

Speaker 5:          02:44:39       Yeah, it's in a, in uh, Houston.

Let's just go to Hawaii. Oh, why is a fucking great place to go no matter what you're going to do. What did you do? Jay Dunkin just got back. He was in Maui at a fucking retreat. That's how he's balling. How he's living. Yeah. He went to some crazy spiritual retreat and um, talked about it on his podcast and met a bunch of people from the podcast. They were there, but he said it wasn't even weird. It said it was weird at first, but everybody was like so tuned in to what the retreat was actually really all about.

Speaker 1:          02:46:05       That it all turned out to be like a really positive experience. Could you do that? Could know. I could never tell it. Shut up. Don't even put that fucking out there. Bunch of freak show up. Do you write your name on my ass? I'm going to get it tattooed. Settle down. Look, I stay after every show and I meet people after every show. I take pictures with everybody until they're tired of taking pictures. I try to be as accessible as possible. I talk to people as much as possible, but I think those type of scenarios where you're just constantly around people, like you were saying, like on a boat or something with most of the people, like literally 90% of the people or more that you run into it, it'd be fine. But there's that 10% that don't know when to leave you alone. Don't give me any space occasionally, but that's what they'll ask.

Speaker 1:          02:46:53       That's what I say to them occasionally. Let's not, can we not talk about me? Joey, a jam band in his friend made a, a song with uh, Joe, uh, with you and your blue cheese and all that stuff and another song. I think they've finished.
