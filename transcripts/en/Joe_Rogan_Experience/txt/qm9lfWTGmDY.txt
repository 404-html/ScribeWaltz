Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Vanette close. Are we close? I'll be close. All right. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Oh, sweet baby. Jesus. We uh, live Gavin mcinnes first beer already cracked, dressed up like Michael Douglas and falling down showing the briefcase. Sean with a briefcase. I got the exact briefcase he had. Are those the same glasses he had basically yet ray bans and I got him. Normally detector would not wear a pocket protector. Correct? No one wears him anymore. But everyone in the movie has one. Yeah. Whenever you want to have a geek in a movie, like some sort of scientific character science character, he has to have a pocket protector. Well, I got all this on Ebay. If you have some pre planning, you can get a costume for like 10 bucks. So this is a dollar 50. You would have taken me months to find this on the street. Yeah. How do you find a pocket protector? Ebay. Ebay, Ebay, Ebay and the tie, I assume.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Is Yours the shirt? Is that a your shirt? Did you buy that shirt? It's a great example. I'm talking about, I had to find this in New York. It took me like two hours. I had to go to a uniform supply store. Huge pain in the ass. I could've got it on Ebay or Amazon for two seconds. Yeah, that's a weird kind of shirt. A button up shirt with short sleeves that you wear with a tie. That's an odd look. It's like I'm formal, but I'm not because I need my forearms free. Yeah, it's like La. Everyone in that movie has one. It's like an la business. It guy back then back then, now no one wears them anymore. Now it's like like a like a hoodie that's like an it guy where like a weird tee shirt and a hoodie. Like Jamie be dressed. Exactly like Jamie.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       Look, that's what a Hoodie, that's what a an it guy's dressed meeting in the form too. They all went at American apparel sweatshirt. Exactly. Oh, that's his own. That's a Jamie Vernon special. It says pull that shit up. Yeah, and you can get that@ayoungjamie.com what does that mean? Pull that shit up. I always telling them, whenever there's something going on in the news or we're talking about something, we don't know what the answer is. Like what is that? Oh, pull it. Shut up Jamie, and it'll find it up on youtube. Huh? Speaking to pull that shit up. I liked this. I like your, your profile because I think you get lumped into like a lot of like really fucked up crazy people because you've got some controversial ideas. But I like what you did. I liked this pro west pro gun pro life pro gay pro Israel pro trump, anti Nazi.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       I don't know what Antifa is. I see it all the time. I'm sure you can explain it to us. Uh, anticensorship antifeminist anti Islam. He leave your heart on your sleeve. You've got it all. It's really handy to do that. I just did that about a week ago. But in this day and age, we're in a weird era where it's like a philosophy age. We're all Romans all of a sudden, like socrates sitting here philosophizing. And you kind of have to make everyone know exactly where you stand on this spectrum. Because if you're slightly right of center, your alt right and your go, no, those guys hate me but I hate these guys so I'm right. You're pro gay. Yeah. I think gays are just, you're born gay and the idea that I know, I know I've, I lived in the city since I was 18 so I've been around gays for a quarter century and I think of these guys I know that had been together for 10 years and I go, so let me get this straight.

Speaker 1:          00:03:14       This, these two are going to break up according to you and evangelical person and then they're just going to make out with some chick with blonde hair and eat her out and like fucker and have a boner and pray to God. Come on. You'd know that won't happen. I, I wonder how much of homosexual behavior could be induced by molestation and early age though. Yeah, that's the million dollar question because that seems to be a real factor. It's not, and this is not the nine people that are born gay, but I think there's a spectrum and I think there's most certainly some gay acts that are committed on young people and horrifically those people tend to on a a pretty frequent basis do the same thing to other young kids, young kids. Really Weird in, in, in terms of like the victims becoming the victimizer. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       I know where you're going with this. We're walking into the elephant in the room, but what kind of, not even mean just just talking about, I was listening to the George to Chi interview today because they're trying to pull up everybody now that the Milo thing is out there, they're pulling up everybody who in any way it has condoned sex with underage people. And George to Kai was talking about his own experiences in camp and it was on the stern show and he was just talking about what he, the way he was describing it as a positive experience with a kid who was in his late teens, I think he said he was 19 and he was like 13 somewhere in that age. And you know, it's absolutely child molestation. It's absolutely illegal. But the way he was describing it, he was pretty much describing it as a positive experience, right?

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       Which when it's your experience, I mean, it's illegal. The guy did something that was against the law. But boy, that's a weird area because it's his experience. And he was talking about, yeah, well here's the deal and this is a mistake Maiello made. You have to acknowledge that what you're talking about is fucked up and horrible and wrong, but you just so happen to have not had a bad experience within those parameters. Like say you were raped as a woman and you came, right? Uh, which by the way happens for some strange reason. So if you're one of those women in, you're about to say that you have to understand that we're going into a very dangerous place right now. And you can't say, look, some rapes are absolutely fabulous, and women have come from them. You have to say, this is fucking horrible. Rape is evil.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       But I buy some weird freak of nature actually liked, or a murderer. I'm sure there's times when you murdered a guy and he ended up, he was a mass murder and it was a good murder. Right? And you go, okay, this, I'm describing a murder. I'm not condoning murder. But in this weird case it worked. And Milo's mistake was he said it worked for me. And then he implied that it could work for a ton of other gays to be fucked at 13. Well he did that, um, drunken peasants podcast and his take on it from the drunken peasants was different than his take on it from mine. And on my podcast it seemed more like he was trying to make light of something that most likely definitely did happen to him. The father, Michael. Yeah. So there's two, there's the father Michael thing, and I don't know if I believe that.

Speaker 1:          00:06:28       I think that's just a, I've heard him say that joke a few times where he's like, I'd never would've given such good head if it wasn't for Father Michael. Right. So you think that might be something like that he's constructed? I don't believe it. I don't know why. That's just my gut. And then the other thing was condoning sexual relationships with 13 year olds. And he said, especially in the gay world, now I know of straight guys who were a strict, I'm thinking of in particular who was molested at camp and it was by an older gay camp counselor. This guy thinks of that guy every day, falls them on Linkedin, hoping he'll die. He wants to murder him. Uh, so the problem with what Milo said is you end up normalizing this behavior and say it's okay if in the gay world, next thing you know, some older gay who's at Camp Goes, well, this is probably a fag that I'm blowing.

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       Right? So this is, okay. Yeah. So what I say to these gays, these 13 year old gates to go, I would be okay with fucking a 29 year old. I go, well, I'm sorry, but we're not normalizing that because the vast, vast majority of times it doesn't turn out well. So No. Yeah, that's a very good way of putting it, you know, and it's, it's really disturbed. Well done. The Milo thing is so odd because first of all, I think he's got this act and let's call it an act cause part of it has got to be an act. He's got a wide spectrum of his personalities. So on Bill Maher he can be a raging liberace queen with pearls on dress like a woman. I mean just like a woman. Yeah. Camper than any woman I know. Yeah. And then for the apology, he's the conservative with the coke bottle glasses.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       Yeah. It's sorta like when a Jamaican goes back to Jamaica and they start speaking in Patois, like their grandmother and not necessarily lying. It's just a wide range of use. Yeah. He plays it up and there it, there's definitely a performance piece to a lot of what he does. What's, what's really interesting is he's very good at riling people up. He's obviously very good at getting people upset and, and in doing so, he's created these sort of false narratives about him, that he's a Nazi, that he promotes genocide. I mean, there was so many people outside the Berkeley thing that were screaming, calling them a Nazi and saying he's a fascist when they in fact were behaving in very authoritarian fascist ways. That's Antifa by the way, you said, I don't know what Antifa is. That's those guys antifascist is that what Antifa stands for?

Speaker 1:          00:08:50       But you're right, they're terrorists and they use terror. They use violence to achieve political gains, which terrorism and these people, it's not like Milo ever set or trump even ever said anything that is remotely close to genocide, but those guys just go. Anyone that wants to enforce immigration laws is a fucking Nazi. So I need violence cause I'm trying to stop Hitler. I'm around the first stages of Hitler, so I'm going back in time and strangling him in his crib. Right, right. But the problem is the way they're reacting to it is the absolute wrong way to react to someone who sang something that you don't agree with. Oh yeah. The the right way is to say something that you feel opposes what they're saying and makes more sense to debate them. That's the beauty of free speech, like w it has no limits. If you want to get out there and deny the Holocaust, you want to get out there and sexualized toddlers all go to your talk.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       I want to hear it. Then in the q and a, I'll shoot you down. Well not, I don't think he even should just be a q and a. I mean I think it should be real clear other there. There should be someone and we shouldn't just rely on the audience to come up with some sort of a response. I think if you're going to have someone as controversial as Milo and you are so opposed to it that you're willing to throw bricks through starbucks windows and light cop cars on fire, there should be someone that can speak for your side and then you should organize some sort of a talk. But this is setting it up the wrong way because you go, it's like someone said to me once, hey man, you know, like we were talking about martial arts falls, black belt. I'd fucking kick everybody's ass.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       No, you wouldn't. No, you wouldn't. First of all, you wouldn't because you'd have discipline and you'd realize the consequences of that. But second of all, when you just kick someone's ass, they don't, they don't just take it like they come back with a bat or a gun or their brother, he started fighting. They want to get it back and it goes back and forth and back and forth. And all conflict pretty much goes that way. You have conflict and then someone responds to that conflict and it escalates. So if you have this thing where you start throwing bricks through windows and light and cop cars on fire in stopping people from talking and hitting people that have a make bitcoin great again, hats and just see that girl got maced in the face by a 60 year olds. Eventually people show up with guns. That's what happens.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       And this is what happens when you keep escalating the violence. You become a them, you become the other, you become the enemy and you create this polarizing atmosphere that's so intense that no dialogue's kind of fix it now because you're the enemy. We, you're talking about the north versus the south. You're, you're talking about, you know, the, the Protestants versus the Catholics, you, you, you create this horrific environment where almost it's almost impossible to avoid violence. Well, so I'm done avoiding it. I'm taking the low road. I'm punching them in the face. So that's what you're doing with this outfit? Yes. That is really what I'm doing with this outfit. I did a talk at Nyu. They pepper sprayed me. Did they re when was this? This was a couple of weeks ago. What did, what was it talk about? I didn't even have a plan. They know me as pro trump or something and they, the, I'm a Nazi because of that.

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       They sh they don't want to give a platform to free speech. That's the irony of all this is they pretend that it's gotten so far. It's beyond debate now in their world. We are recruiting fascists for some sort of imminent genocide. So we're like signing up the brown shirts with a form at our talks and you go say that was possible. Uh, how does that work? Like we sign you up, then you're part of the club. Then you come with us on the next genocide. The fuck are you talking about? You haven't played it through in your mind because for these people it's a religion. That's why they don't want to debate. It's like a born again. He doesn't want to debate about the existence of God. He's already on that side. So what was your plan when you went there? What did, what did you want to talk?

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       I was going to say, uh, this Nazi that, uh, that you've made Milo and I out to be who wants genocide and who, uh, sees nonwhites is inhuman, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, homophobic, sexist, whatever. Uh, first of all, that guy should be allowed to talk if he existed, but he doesn't exist. Your monster is a mythical beast and you've gone to college, you're 60 grand in debt already to fight this mythical beast who doesn't fucking exist? Well, in terms of Milo, he definitely doesn't exist. Milo is not a Nazi. He's definitely, he's not promoting genocide. And those are two things that just get trumpeted about left and right. Exactly who is. But Milo has said some very inflammatory things about and in a very generalizing way about women and about the wage gap and about all sorts of things that he designs his words and his phrases to be inflammatory.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       So he gets the most response and it's been incredibly profitable. I mean up into Harper Collins pulled his book deal. He had a $250,000 book advance. His book was number one on Amazon. Just sheerly through controversy. Yup. I mean through presales and controversy. So it's a strategy and a lot of ways and it's also a response to this really hard stance that the far left is taking this anti anti free speech stance. Right. But always with these cases you go, what exactly did he say? I always say this to people who bitch about it and I told her, I go, what sentence in what book is factually incorrect? What specifically are you saying? And with this Milo thing, he said that often sexual relationships with 13 year olds can be beneficial for gays. Uh, he has since retracted that and apologized, but that's not enough. And that's about as as egregious as it gets.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       The other stuff that he says we all say in a joking way and then that becomes pure evil and you advocate for this, right? So the left is willfully ignorant of humor when it comes to Milo and with trump too, like the grab the pussy thing, which they had a whole fucking parade about and they still wear these dumb wool hats to look like a pussy, which is a joke you said on a bus, you're wearing a dumb joke on your head. Uh, they, they know that he doesn't want to have a new policy called the pussy grabbing statute, but they are willfully hiding their sense of humor so they can take things literally and go off on a tirade of it. Well, I think they're shocked that we've been fed our entire life po politicians that speak in a statesmen Lee like way a very predetermined, planned out way where they have pauses in their speech like Obama, when he speaks, he has some very non normal patterns to his behavior.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       Yeah. Like those, those things that people do. The showmanship of being a president, that it's all designed to comfort you and have you think that this person is clearly different than anyone. You know, they talk different, they have better speaks president beaches, they have better speaks. They, they're, they're, they're statesmen like, you know, they, they speak in these, uh, preplanned out sentences that are articulate and, and, and cleanly worded. And that's not what you get with trump. And that disturbs the shit out of people. It just serves it. Like, I saw so many people going off the other day about his talk about uranium and Hillary Clinton's selling uranium. You know, how it's things and you, it's for things very bad. Things like he's running out of words. She doesn't know what the words are. You know, that doesn't necessarily mean anything, but people are pointing to it like it's this horrible moment where this president, essentially all he did was run out of words and just the fucking guys probably working 16 hours a day, that's probably exhausted.

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       I mean, the overwhelming stress of the job for any one of them is almost immediately apparent once they get into office. And you're seeing it with trump as well. You're seeing like, like that unhinged press conference that he made guarantee you. Some of that has to do with the fact that guy has worn the fuck out. You know, he's a 70 year old man, like I'm almost 50 and I'm fucking tired all the time. How's this guy who's 20 years older than me? Can I deal with the stress of running the biggest economy, the biggest military, the most insane country the world has ever known. Yeah, I mean that's what the United States is. Yeah. They say Maggie Thatcher slept four hours a night, four hours a night repeatedly starts to chip away at your psyche. Oh yeah. But the thing I would say about trump when they say he's not presidential is I tried that, I tried it with Romney.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       You got mad at his binder comment. I, I tried it with cruise, the constitutional superman and who could debate anyone and was area died and and presidential. And you went, no, he's ugly. So I said, okay, I'm bringing in Rodney dangerfield from caddyshack and he's just going to be a wrecking ball. And when Huffington Post says we're putting trump in the entertainment section, said of the new section, Romney and cruise wouldn't have said anything. Trump says, ann coulter points this out in your book. In trump, we trust jump goes, uh, Arianna Huffington. Didn't your husband leave you for a man? Yeah, I think he made the right choice. I think it was a very good choice. And I go that you, you brought this on yourself. You made me have to get him. Well, what she's doing, you know, within culture is doing is very similar to what Milo's doing.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       You mean there, there are merchants of outrage and that's what they're doing. I disagree. I think they're speaking in a hyperbolic tone. They're flamboyant, but that's what the charter was still there. Yes. There's, there's definitely some truth, especially with Milo that some of the things that he says, um, but all truth. What, what? Like again, I'm saying it right now. What, what did he say this factually incorrect? Well, that wasn't a joke. Not, not factually incorrect, but extremely offensive to people like the 13 year old boy comment. Like the thing about sort of normalizing relationships between grown men and 13 year old boys. Right. You know, I think a big part of why he even says that is because he's in many ways like a natural contrarian and in many ways a guy who wants to get a rise out of people. And by saying that he didn't feel like there's any consequences to being outrageous in that regard. But I think we could both agree whether or not it's factual. In his case

Speaker 2:          00:18:48       it's a fucked up thing to say right at the fucked up thing to say it was negligent, which is why I apologize. But I think the grain of truth to that and with his other statements is a lot more than a grain, but the grain of truth to what he was saying, his gaze have less chastity than straights. And if a woman is known as a slut, she's less likely to be picked up. And I've been sued for calling woman a slut. Where are you really? Yup. Who Sued you? It was a long time ago. Back in vice days it was in do's and don'ts. And the, the way the law is, it's kind of antiquated, but it's like, oh, you called her a slut now she won't have currency in the market of marriage. Well, because she's known as a whore, so we're going to punish you punitively for this sin.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       Did you have to settle? Yeah. God dammit. You can't even call someone a slut. There's no word for a man. No, I cad. That's a compliment. That's hilarious. Yeah. A cat is hilarious. Well, the fact that there's no equivalent for a man shows you that there's a different standard. And then with gays it is different to like 13 year old and an older person, right? If it's a girl and a 40 year old teacher, I want to take him to the parking lot and beat him till he's has a weird, he walks weird for the rest of his life. If it's a woman in a boy, uh, I don't want to murder her. I'm grossed out 13, especially 14 little better. And then with gays, uh, well I'm not gonna make the same mistake Milo made right now. Don't ever do it. But if a guy's known as a slut in the future, like say a 19 year old fucks, 200 people as a woman, no one wants to go near as a gay. You've been around the block.

Speaker 1:          00:20:25       Yeah, it's not, this is not the same consequences for sure. And I, I had a bit of my act about, I don't know if you remember this commercial, but there was a commercial adjust for men commercial where there was a baby that was driving a porsche, a baby with a beard and there was a grown woman next to the baby and the baby has like a Tuxedo on and it's like you've always wanted the biggest bed, his beard and the baby goes to the nightclub and a bouncer looks at him a winks. And I'm like, look at this, look at this commercial. [inaudible] see the babies. Yeah. So the baby walks in just for men. I mean, I dunno what the fuck just for men, if you don't know it is some stuff that guys put in their beard when they're getting old. So this baby's got a bottle, he goes out to the dance.

Speaker 1:          00:21:02       For this. All these girls with these tiny little skirts dancing around him and he's like, he's like a pimp and he's with this hot woman. And this to me, my bit was this is proof, positive proof, positive. There's no sexual equality when it comes to child molesting. Cause if you even wrote that down with the sexist reversed, if you wrote it down, you're fucking going to jail. Okay. There's a little baby girl and she goes out to a room full of guys who are wearing Tarzan skirts and they're all swinging dicks around her and she's got a bottle and they're all fighting for her attention and kissing her on the cheek. You would go to fucking jail. But that was a commercial that aired on mainstream television. No one cared about it. That commercial aired for years. It's probably still on now. And that commercial is proof positive that we have a completely different attitude towards a grown woman who's hot as fuck and a little baby.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       Yeah, well even I was watching big with the kids the other day. Tom Hanks is what? Eight in that movie? Nine and then that woman's seduces him and I guess he fucks her. He gets a boner and I'm like, you're raping a child. Exactly. Why are we watching? And she's hot. She's hot and he looks like a man. So I'll just let it ride. If that movie was reversed and it was a young girl that all of a sudden was in a sexual woman's body and the guy was fucking her, she's like, I don't know. Are we supposed to be doing this? You would be horrified. You would be absolutely horrified. I've been arguing about cause of the Milo thing when arguing about all this a lot and I've been getting from gays and guides with kids that are young. Uh, this whole thing about how they, they keep saying, come on, don't lie.

Speaker 1:          00:22:36       You would definitely want to fuck a 13 year old girl if she was hot. And I go, I don't know where this became a normal sentence. I fucked 17 year olds when I was 17 it was the worst sex. I remember that. And you'd be on top of her and is out. You didn't even know when it was in. Nobody do what was going on. Yeah. It's not like they go, yeah, fuck it. Aw. They didn't like it until they were like 26 I want pendulous breasts. I want a divorce. Say with a neck pendulous, like worn out just for pencils. Hey, hanging. Hanging low for I want, I want to look like Cox when she's on all and I want to see them. Actually I don't want to see them swing cause I'll come if I look at this. Oh come on. I'm not talking about like a orange in a sock.

Speaker 1:          00:23:22       Oh, I mean like it's got meat there, but they droop you like when you're fucking her from behind. They go and they've experienced life circles. Yes. They've experienced. When I want to play tennis with a toddler. You want to play tennis with somebody who can return a serve. Yes. Good point. Yeah. I don't know. Get that. Yay. Come on. You never been attracted to a 15 year old girl like I don't, I really don't get that. But I know I was molested by a woman when I was 13 years old. Oh Shit. When I was 13 years old, there was a woman that we used to play softball with on our block and apparently she did it to a lot of boys and she took me up to her room. She played me some really good music. She introduced me to a lot of led Zeppelin.

Speaker 1:          00:24:02       She introduced me to comfortably numb floyd this day. When I think about that song, I think about making out with her, but she was 21 and I was 13 she just kissed you? No, she grabbed my dick but I was just so little fuck I was doing now. No, I was so confused. I was 13. I was like a little boy, you know, if she had caught me like a year or two later, I probably would have fucked her. But that at that stage I was baffled because I had like zero sexual experience. And then all of a sudden a woman, a 21 year old woman with tetes of smoked cigarettes and she was making out with me and taking me up to a room is really weird. And she had a boyfriend and her boyfriend was a construction worker and he was a man. I remember seeing him like on the job, he has his shirt off and had a hairy chest.

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       I was like, what in the fuck? And that was her boyfriend, but she was just a wild woman. And she uh, apparently like taking young boys that didn't know what they're doing and taking them up to her room. You know, this is why we have judges cause there's different cultures, different genders, different circumstances. Every time I talked to a black guy about their first sexual experiences, my hair is whitened. Why? It's always like, yeah, I just fucked my cousin when I was 12 like Chris cotton was talking about fucking his cousin was Chris Cotton, comedian guy, dark as a piece of coal, uh, fucked his cousin's Shirad small fucked his babysitter when he was like 11 or 12 stories before. I've heard the babysitter story before where it's like, you know, you're 13 she's 18 and next thing you know you're making out with her and Ollie, she's horrible, but should she go to jail for 15 years?

Speaker 1:          00:25:39       Well, that's a big, there's a big difference between an eight year old, 18 year old boy rather, and an 18 year old girl and a 13 year old girl and a 13 year old boy. There's a just a big goddamn difference if you're a grown woman and a 13 year old boy. Like, here's the thing, here's the big one, and this is like, this is, this was one of the things that came up in the Milo, a conversation to where he was saying that it's not that big a deal if a man grabs a woman's tit and she doesn't want them to. I'm like, well, that's sexual assault. If a woman grabs my dick and I don't want her to, that might be sexual assault, but I'm not in danger. You know what I'm saying? It's like she's not going to fuck me up. She's not going to rape me.

Speaker 1:          00:26:17       And that's where it gets different. Like I'm not scared. Like if a woman came over and grabbed my ass like that, you probably shouldn't do that, but I'm not scared of you. You know? So, um, but if a man does that to a woman and he's willing to violate our space like that, a woman has a real fear, there is a possibility what the, the door might be open it, this guy could rape her. Right. And this all comes down to the myth of equality. And this is why the right is more, has a more benevolent society than the left. The, and I've noticed this with girls. I've always said you can hit a woman if she hits you 12 times, that includes punches in the face. So you just sit there going, one, two, three, 12 and then 11 12th and then one I can't even hit one.

Speaker 1:          00:26:59       If they hit me 12 I'd have to arm drag her, take her back. Choker, you could choke. A crazy woman is trying to kill you, but you can't punch 12 I would only do it if I thought they were hurting someone in my family. Well, when I talked to a feminist and liberals about this, they go 12 one and I go, what? Why? It's, you know, we're stronger than you, right? They don't want to admit that. They don't to admit that. And it's the same with gays and it's the same like I was writing about. You remember that documentary dog fight dwg and I'm looking at that. That was Kimbo slice is in that and I'm, I'm done on two dot. A 5,000 a 5,000 and a I'm looking at it going, you guys were murdering each other on the streets. You figured out a way to solve it with fights, backyard fighting.

Speaker 1:          00:27:40       You shouldn't have the same enforcement as rich white kids doing it in the suburbs. Or at least that's what your instincts are when you see that. Now that doesn't make sense. The laws should be equitable across the board, but you go, this is a different situation. They're in a shitty situation. They're murdering each other, these backyard fights. Sure someone loses an eye, but they're not murdering each other anymore. It's an improvement. And you go, I don't know how to enforce this. I don't know how it's done, but you feel like there should be different, lots of different people. And when you say we're all exactly the same, well the next thing you know, women are getting punched one on one and they're not as strong as men. So they're getting fucking beating them. Or you're telling women they're invincible, they're going out and getting shit faced like you and I do.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       And you go, no, you, you're a Lamborghini. You can't get wasted. Your delicate, I'm a fucking cheap old, 57 Chevy beat me up. Right, right, right. Well, there's, there's a narrative, um, whether or not people are aware of it, but there is something that is actually being thrown around as being a viable narrative. And that is that there's no biological difference between men and women. There's no biological difference between the sexes and it, when you see people say it, it's, I saw it, there was a debate that Jordan Peterson had. Uh, and one of the PR, the people that he was debating was a professor from the University of Toronto and it was a gender equality professor or something along that, some bizarre discipline. And I think it was a transgender man. Like she was born a woman and then she's a man or maybe, yeah, I, I'm, I'm pretty sure it's, I'm not sure, but it seems like it anyway, it's a very feminine man.

Speaker 1:          00:29:23       Whatever it is. And it seems like a woman that became a man and it, she, he, whichever how Z, Z, Z, z. Um, and literally arguing, knowing that this is going to be broadcast, knowing this is going to be on television, on the Internet, saying that there's no difference. There's no biological basis. And like, that's insane. There's, there's no difference between men and women. It is absolutely insane. It's absolutely insane. There are no women who come anywhere near what men power lifters can do. They don't come anywhere near, they might be stronger than you or I, they might. They might cause they're doing it for a long time and had taken steroids, but even the women who take steroids, there are no where near as strong as the men. It's not even close. There's no women who are in the NFL. There's no women heavyweight boxing champions.

Speaker 1:          00:30:16       They're never going to beat the men. There's, there's an absolutely a biological basis and sex. I have trained extensively with women in martial arts extensively. There is an enormous difference and how hard they hit. There's an enormous difference in how strong they are. I feel like I could beat them up. There's a lot of would fuck you up. I'm just like, I couldn't beat Ronda Rousey, but I feel like I could beat up the base. No, a lot of feathers weighs, most of them would fuck you up, but it's just a technique thing. You know, if if you had trained as long as them, they would be in trouble. It's just there's a lot of factors didn't. Yes. Well, I got in Shit for saying it because there was a man who transitioned to a woman after 30 years of being a woman after fathering a child, being in the military, the whole deal, go on living life as a man, became a woman for two years and then started having mma fights with women and not telling them that he was a woman for 30 years.

Speaker 1:          00:31:11       She was a woman for 30 years and then became a one. I'm like, that's fucking crazy. And that the structure of the body's different, the hips are different. The jaws different than the size of the hands is different. The size of the fist is an enormous difference between the hour that a man can generate. When I see that trainee pounding the living shit out of a woman, it's like domestic violence. Disturbing. Yeah. I, I've, I see it on the TV and I go, there you go, liberals. There's your utopia. What do you think? And that's the problem with their utopia. It keeps making things worse and worse and worse for them. Yes. Like even abortion and immigration in Canada, now they're, they're pouring all these Indians in like pancake batter and a Indians prefer to have boys than girls and they're starting to have gender based abortions where they go, I don't want to have a boy.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       I mean I go to hanging out around here. I'm good. Let's keep aborting till we get a boy. And you go, Hey Lena, is that real? Yeah, he liberals, it's, it's mostly the immigrants, but you know, it's the beginning of ethnic genocide and you go, hey feminists, you're pro choice shit is getting you fucking killed. What? That wasn't, they're going to become the next retards. That wasn't the, you know, the reason why they wanted it in the first place. They just wanted the right to choose. They want someone to tell them, and particularly in the most extreme cases, like if a woman's raped, like if a woman's raped and she gets pregnant, she should not have to keep that baby. They're taking right exceptions. But that is the freaking second that I'm sick of freak exceptions. Defining policies. Okay, but would you be, would you be fine with those freak exceptions being law?

Speaker 1:          00:32:44       Like if you're, you, you're a pro life person, right? That's your stance. Sure. Okay. Um, would you be pro choice of a woman was raped? I'm not doing that anymore. No. No. What do you mean I'm not playing that game anymore? Okay. Well I'm not trying to play it in what they do. I know, I know. Other side of that is that your daughter, they always, inevitably, especially with journalists, I'll be talking about sexism, blah, blah, blah. And they'll go, what if your daughter was blah, blah, blah? And I go, you're trying to make me irrational. Okay, but I'm not accusing you of this. But it's like these liberals have these tricks where like what if a girl was raped by her father and she got pregnant and I looked it up. I could only find one case, one case in America of a father impregnating a daughter.

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       And I thought this freak occurrence keeps defining the whole debate. We've got kermit Gosnell killing 40,000 babies that were in their third trimester yet. This one man is who's a, he was the guy, he's, he's a, he was arrested for performing a late term abortion from abortions and they discovered that it was a, sorry 40,000 is my personal estimate of the whole country, but I think he did hundreds and hundreds. Now I understand what you're saying that you don't want to get roped into any crazy sort of hypothetical scenario where you say, what if it was your daughter and she was raped by some convict to just got to that. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I know you don't want to get into that, but in, in certain circumstances, I really think there's a, there's, there is, uh, a difference between someone who's pregnant for three weeks and someone was pregnant for five months.

Speaker 1:          00:34:20       There's a big difference. Yeah. Like with the ocean, I just want to get it, get it away from 17 weeks. Like I want to get it down. I want to get the whole argument down to eight weeks, eight weeks. My goal. Okay. So my, I have friends in New York City where everyone has to think outside the box and they're all like, yeah, it's murder and I'm for it. Like Jim Goad says that all the time. Anthony Kumina says that it's murder and I think it's awesome. Well, that's because he doesn't want to be responsible and he, he fucks a lot of crazy girls. That's really the problem. I mean, I've been to super fortunate that the, the person that I had babies with, I love. Yeah. I mean, [inaudible] uh, is got to take a lot of blame for this shit he got in recently. We all told him to get the fuck away from her and he kept walking back into the client's fun and I would see him with her and it was like a fucking rape victim being with their rapists.

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       Like I go, oh, what is that doing here? And she left thigh high stockings. Ooh. Time to fuck. I can get you a five year old. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not fun. He, I have a friend, my friend Tony, Tony's Zara from Columbus, Ohio. Good Buddy. Of Mine, who's a great guy, but he's, he's also a wise man. And uh, he has had this theory about psychotic and erotic until almost the, to basically almost that's true, interchangeable, that they sort of rotate on each of this access. And that when you get, like we've all had gals from the past, there were just like, Whoa, you know, you'll leave their apartment and go, Holy Shit, I gotta take a shower. I got to cool down jasmine. Yeah. And then they start calling you later, like, come over and fuck my mouth. Like what?

Speaker 1:          00:36:05       Jesus Christ, like the crazy ones, the ones who want you to take a teaspoon and scoop the come off their face so they can get, and this is only going to happen once in my entire life, but here we go. And those girls exist and some of them are really fun. And when you're a guy and you're used to girls that are like, no, don't come in my mouth. No, don't touch me there. No, I'm not going to. You know there's like some, so many people are so reserved and so restricted and so, so confined and then you date some crazy girl and she's just wild. She's like put it in my ass. You're like, Whoa, where are we going with anthony? She was that and then some and already was like framing little kids who were at the house. I think she got one of them got marker on them and or she, she put sparkles in his hair or something and the mother goes, what the hell is going on with your hair you've got that's going to take forever to get out.

Speaker 1:          00:36:59       And she goes, it was her and blamed some 10 year old, no evils dark shit she had done. But that being said, so that's going too far. But I do agree wholeheartedly. And when my friends tell me they dumped some bitch cause she's crazy, I get mad at them because I go, you crazy. Pitches are the best sex you'll ever have in your life. If she's not calling the cops then he fucking her. But that's what you're hypocritical then. Cause that's anthony. That's the gun. It's the balance gets to the point where they call the cops. Sex should be right before that. You should see the judge in the room floating above your head with the gavel like, uh, see, nobody wants to say that. And there is a reality. And here's another reality. It's super uncomfortable reality. And this is, I want to just get real clear about this.

Speaker 1:          00:37:47       This is in no way condoning any form of rape or any form of sexual assault or any form of doing anything to anyone, male or female against their will. That said, there are women who undeniably have rape fantasies. Yes. So what's that? Margaret Atwood talks about that and she says, yes, but in our rape fantasies, it's not a guy with a ski mask who jumps out of a Bush fat and ugly. It's Mr clean and he's cleaning our house and then he says, Hey, I want to make love to you and you're going, no, no level of law. But that's her though. Some, some women, it's a guy comes in with a gun and makes her suck his dick. There's, I've, I've had a friend who that was her thing. We've all, everyone Louis C k does a bit about that. We've all had women where they're like, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:38:37       And then you stop and they go, you find it the next day. No, no. You were supposed to. Oh yeah. Louie had the thing like, I'm not going to take a chance to find out if it's your thing. I got an email, I can talk about this all the time, but I got an email from a girl that said thank you for raping me last night. Oh, but that might be that like right up to the girls. And I always say like that and they might be joking around. Oh yes, of course she was. But that was her way of saying you got right to the line. But I noticed this when I moved to New York too. I was, went to college in the 90s when it was about permission and feminism. So I tried that. I was like, do you, is this okay? Is this feminist? And let's be clear about that.

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       You are a feminist at one point your life, would you define yourself as a feminist? I still would. In many ways. I see them as magical centi and beings. They're wizards. They can make a fucking person come out of their current and to say they're dudes is, is to trivialize. It's like saying to Clark Kent, just be a journalist. Just focus on your journalism and Clark Kent's a shitty journalist. You're a shitty man. Does he have one store that he came in his story I've ever, he's turned time backwards. Oh, that's right. But he's never broken a story, but we keep telling women, no, no, no. Come to our meetings. Come to where a tough mudder relay and walk through electrical wires and go underneath. So good at that. By the way, you tough mudder people that fucking water you would never drink. You would never drink puddle water.

Speaker 1:          00:39:54       Right? Right. Yeah, of course you wouldn't. Well, guess what? Fuck face you getting that water in your mouth when you're crawling around. That same shit that you would get in your intestinal tract. You're going to get in your mouth and you're going to get sick as fuck. Okay. So big God damned careful when you're doing those things. It seems like a weird beef to have. Well, tough mudder or people to the puddles are way too. You gotta be really careful about drinking puddle water. Like I know guys who have gotten Giardia, they've gotten like some serious intestinal disorders from drinking water. Yeah, well, you're out in the mountains. You go out in the mountains and like they don't bring water with them or their, they, the water filter breaks or they put these a iodine tablets of the water, but they don't wait long enough.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       Then they drink it and you're getting these live bacteria in your body and they wreck havoc with your system. I mean, put you out for months. Okay. Okay. I won't drink puddle water, please. So anyway, you're fucking chicks. And, uh, through trial and error, there's that time that you're on 24, and you're fucking girl from behind and you go, yeah, you like that and you go, I'm going to try a dad thing just, and then you go, who's your? Yeah, you'd like that daddy's fuck. And then all of a sudden, pussy juice galore and she's coming and you go, oh, okay, I'm going to keep mining this vein. I'm your father, blah, blah, blah. You start saying shit like that. And then you start and then you come to New York and Jewish girls in New York, they're like, choke me. Kill me. I'm a fucking whore.

Speaker 1:          00:41:21       Slap me. And you're like, um, like that, uh, no harder. You fucking pussy. See those, those, those girls never made their way to me. Oh really? Yeah. You fucked girls in New York? No. Well, I did, but I think I, I don't know, maybe. I don't know, man. Maybe I just shied away from them or something like that. I had some domestic violence in my house when I was growing up. Old Shit like that. I was like, well, that's kind of what I'm saying. We don't naturally go. There were sweeties I had one girl that liked to get choked though it, but it always weirded me out. We don't, we're not that enthusiastic about it, but if they want us to dress like clowns, I would put it on the little nose. Yeah, it is. You get into it after a while you realize it's awesome, but don't want to get choked by someone who knows how to choke you though.

Speaker 1:          00:42:06       You want to get choked by someone ineffective, like a sloppy choke where you could still breathe. Well, I remember it was fucking this Jewish girl and she was, she said, kill me. Whoa cheese. And uh, obviously I didn't do that. And then she's like, I'm your fucking whore at some coming on her. She's like, I'm your dirty whore. And then she's having a cigarette after and she goes, I brought your whore. By the way. I was like, Duh. And I thought the Liberals now are ruining that whole role playing fun game that we all play. And sex is a nebulous, it's like religion, it's personal, it's private. It's a weird area where you do weird things. You say stupid shit. Like I want to lick your cock because you're thinking, I want you to suck my cock and want to lick your pussy, but you're so horny. You're brain goes, yeah, I want to lick your balls when you look my balls. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       Yeah. Dirty talk is so awkward. I can't do fucking stupid. I just can do like so good. Love it. Heaven. Yeah, but it's also like when you're intimate with someone, it's like you're, you're sharing that extremely vulnerable moment. I mean, it's, look, it's vulnerable nature because you don't have your clothes on, you know, and just, you feel weird. You know, we always have our clothes on so we don't have our clothes on. It's just odd, you know? And then like funny nude. Yeah. You're funny. You look funny and you're aroused and it feels good and you're, you want the other person to feel good. You feel good to each other and it's just, you're looking at each other's eyes and you're like that close. It's like, it's very strange and there's other, there's also the issue that people become very addicted to each other. I think human beings, especially when having sex with each other, it's just like a drug addiction.

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       I mean, I remember the first time is in a lot of ways I think it is. I think there's a lot of, there's a lot of endorphins that are being exchanged and there's a lot of arousal chemicals that are excluded when you're with that person that are extremely potent and when the person's not there, there's this deep need to get to that person. Again, just like a drug, just like, uh, you know, someone who's got hooked on pain pills and you just, you have to get the pills. He got to get the pills. And I remember, um, when I was in, when I was like 18, my girlfriend broke up with me and I had just graduated from high school and I was really lost and confused. And when she broke up with me, I was devastated. I couldn't believe I had to be without her.

Speaker 1:          00:44:29       And it was very much like withdrawal from a drug. It was like probably the worst breakup for me ever because it was the first one, you know? And I was like, I can't believe this. Like this is crazy. And then I just was amazed at like how potent it was on my system, you know, and how it would fuck with my psyche and my mind. I felt like a loser. I felt like if this girl didn't want me, like I must be a fool, I must be a failure. Well that's the, we've all had that. And that's where you learn never to be vulnerable again. And you learn to be a man sort of, but you also learn to me, I, I've always been fascinated by psychology and fascinated by the inner workings of the mind and the tricks the mind plays on you. Cause all throughout high school, from age 15 on, I was competing in martial arts tournaments and there were terrifying, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:45:16       And so I was always scared and I would go from, I mean, I, I'd like to say that all y'all was just bad motherfucker. I wasn't scared of Shit. I was scared of fucking everything, man. That's why I was good cause I was terrified and I was always training super hard and I wouldn't drink it. I wouldn't do anything. I wouldn't, I smoked pot maybe a couple of times because I was fucking scared of getting killed. I was scared of getting my ass kicked. So when this happened and this girl broke up with me, it was so doug, just devastating to my, to, to my confidence. And I remember thinking like, God, why do I feel like such a fucking loser? And then breaking it down and try to figure like, how was I a winner just like a few months ago and now I'm a loser. Like in my mind, I feel like a fucking loser and I can't get laid.

Speaker 1:          00:45:59       Girls that smelled desperation. I mean they run from me like Ah, like, like 18 year old girls. When you're desperate, they fucking, they smell, you stink like a sewer and they run from you. My couldn't get laid for like six months. I couldn't even get close. It's nature. You, you played yourself, you were vulnerable. You learned to never do that again. And I think adult men, especially married men, have to understand that you're constantly in high school when you're married. It's not Dale Aiken when I was eight years old, he said, dude, when you're married, you can just go up to your wife and go, let me see your tits. Does she has to show you her tits right there. And I thought, I cannot fucking wait. I remember seeing him, I'm just going to put my face in her vagina and just go blow. Uh, but you can't do that if I want it to my wife and said, show me a tip sheet.

Speaker 1:          00:46:43       Say Fuck off. So you're constantly wooing them according to, and I had a buddy who got divorced recently and he said, I just found myself having to draw lines in the sand and make these parameters around how it can be treated and how it can be spoken to. And he goes, I've never had to do that before. I shouldn't have to do that. And they go, dude, that's what marriage is. You're constantly on a date. I was on a date with my wife last night. Uh, we got a hotel in the city or my kids are staying with their grant. We're, we're here on vacation in Malibu. And uh, I was constantly going, all right, I wanted her to have a good night. She wants to get Tacos, but also I have to draw the line and say, no, actually we're going here, we're going to the comedy store, we're going to meet Don Barris and go upstairs and blah blah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:20       So I was giving her some democracy but also taking the reigns and it's a push and pull that we've been married, we've known each other since 2001 but it's constantly like first day trying to get in her pants, watch the real housewives, pretend to care about that. Chico was Pinot Grigio all the time trying to get pussy. You're not guaranteed the pussy. No. If you are, you have a very strange relationship and you probably not going to be satisfied with it because that's part of what's going on in a relationship is that wooing is also like kind of that wooing and courting and, and, and, and being nice to each other. It's very important to like how the whole thing works. Yes. It's what attracts like we were, we were in Costa Rica on those stupid sands of flights that are one engine. So if it goes out, we're dying and the turbulence was insane.

Speaker 1:          00:48:05       And so she's gripping me and I'm like, it's okay. It's just a bus. We're in a bus in the sky. I am shitting my pants, my heart is pounding through my chest and I'm holding her rationally, explaining to her what is going on. And then I'm looking at the window going, holy fuck, we're going to fucking die. We're going to fucking die. Holy Shit. And I still married to her for years. We've got kids. I have to convey this man in order to keep her pussy wet. And it's the same with sons particularly, but kids in general. But so much of being a dad is being a prison warden. And even after bedtime, you're walking down the hallways to see if lights are on. The other day I go into my son's, my middle son's room, I touch the light bulb is reading light and I can feel it's warm.

Speaker 1:          00:48:45       I'm like, what's going on in here? Where you reading? He was like, yeah, a little bit. Bedtime is bedtime. Went back with my little fucking, it was 10 30 at night and he's reading mad magazine was blackjacks black [inaudible] thing when I was a kid, cops had them. I remember it was like, it was a leather like paddle with low shot and yeah, whack people with it. So really shitty weapon cause it only hurts, you know, you walk someone out if you hit him on the jar, the back of their head. But if you're covering up and someone's whacking you with that blackjack, not so bad. I'll take a shot with a black jack to try to get ahold of you. But like a club, like a club or a baton, like that's going to really fucking hurt. A blackjack is weird. It's a weird weapon.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       It kind of went away. They're like, yeah, this isn't the best thing to be carrying around. I remember wanting to get one of those aerial sort of in tennis. Those are dangerous. Those cops told me I'm not allowed to have that. You can have a leather man, you could buy those. Yeah, but you're not allowed to have it on you. Leatherman and pepper spray or Anna maglite flashlight. You can have, wait a minute. So You concealed carry, meaning walking around, you're not allowed to have one of those, but you're allowed to have a knife. You could have a knife if it's a utility knife and it's smaller than the palm of your hand. I'm talking about New York rules. Right? And then at Nyu I was going to do that talk. I got pepper sprayed. Perfectly legal if they can argue that. No. Who was pepper sprayed you and did you see the person doing it and do you know who they are? They are all the same. They're all middleclass, uh, kids of professors, they all live at home. They all look exactly the same. They look British. Uh, how do they look? British? I don't know. They have like these angular features and these Roman noses in glasses, they all look exactly the same. Nothing Italian about them. Now what was it that they pepper sprayed you about?

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       Will you actually get going to do tacos and going by the College Republicans? I started this gang called the proud boys. And how boys? The proud boys. What is was proud boys about? We have chapters all over the world. We meet once a month. We, uh, we uh, get drunk and just, it's like the elks lodge like Mason's or whatever. Celebrating manhood. Yeah, no women allowed. Oh Wow. Can't tell your woman what goes on at the meetings. Uh, and we have different degrees like the knights of Columbus first degree, you declare yourself a proud boy. Second degree. We'd beat the shit out of you until you can name five breakfast cereals and you have to give him masturbating. And then third degree, you still have to give up masturbating, but you have to get a tattoo and then fourth degree you get arrested or in a serious violent fight for the grills.

Speaker 2:          00:51:12       Yes. You get arrested in a serious violent fights. So you're promoted by some sort of major altercation. You shouldn't erase that part. Well we don't, we don't encourage it. But if you're defending is like at the, at the Berkeley thing with Milo, we just, the my guys just 14 of them just walked into a mob of 200 people just to get their stripes. Said I thought you guys were tough. No they were doing it just for fun and these people outside of pepper spray and clubs, they can't fight. Like at the Nyu thing, my guys were beating them up and he goes, this one guy we call friar tuck cause he's just a monster. He goes, I started feeling bad in it. I started feeling bad after a while cause I was just, I could tell these kids had never been in a fight and I was just mowing through them.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       They're terrible fighters. They're total proceeds fighting like this is what confuses me. Like why are they getting so angry that they're hitting people and spraying that girl in the face. The girl was really disturbing because she was talking to someone and she wasn't offering any threat and she, she had a hat that looked like a make America great again hat but it said make bitcoin great again. They walk up to her, the guy hits her with a stick that's holding a sign. So he hits her in the head with a piece of wood and she's like, what the fuck? And someone sprays her in the face with pepper spray. I mean it's like how in any way, how could you ever, in any other scenario justify beating a woman publicly for doing nothing but representing what you think is offensive and you're even a wrong about what she's representing.

Speaker 2:          00:52:43       Here's the problem with what you're doing. And I did this too much to your intellectualizing a fashion movement. This is the mods and the rockers in Brighton Beach in 1961 just fighting each other because one likes Elvis and the other likes the WHO. And if you were to sit down with this mod in this rocker and say, have a debate, they wouldn't say anything. They have nothing to say. It's leather versus park cause it's vespas worth versus triumph motorbikes. There's no context there. So this guy is on this team and she's on the other team and that their tool is pepper spray and that's what they're doing. There's no that's, they pretend, oh, I don't want to give you a platform. No, they don't want to give you in anything because they don't have anything to say. In fact, at the Nyu talk I, after I watched the pepper sprayed, I went and did the talk.

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       They're all screaming, uh, who's campus? Our campus. As soon as I walk over to the mob with a microphone and I have to and Oh, come on up, come on up. And it was a radioactive cock. I was handing him like, he just went, well because then it was a mike. He shriveled up because he wanted to be a part of the big group. Right. And didn't want to be an individual with an opinion and didn't exactly know why he was there in the first place and exactly know what he was protesting against. That's why like Milo would kill to debate any of these people. He's, he's been scrounging for pneumonia. The problem is that they're not debating. That's the real problem. I feel like this could be really productive if people could sit down in Milo, by the way, we'll debate you. I mean he might say outrageous things.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       He might say offensive things, but he will debate. He will sit in front of a podium here. We always time and anyone else will that will have their time and they will be able to take questions from the audience. And this could be very productive and you could kind of figure out like what you and I are not far left and we're not far right. You know, neither one of us are. We're, we're in some sort of a weird way. I think I'm more maybe more left than you are, but I'm not as left as a lot of people I know and there's a lot of people out there and I think this left white right paradigm is really kind of fucking foolish at this point. And we should kind of figure out like what's, what's, what's, what kind of opinions are okay to have because they don't interfere with anybody else's life.

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       And it's just a, your philosophy and the way you look at the world and you should be able to express that opinion and express those ideas in front of someone else who has an opposing idea and they tell you why they disagree and you should be able to consider why they disagree and see if there's any merit in that. The problem you're w with what you're saying is you're implying that these are all informed people right and left and they need to hash out ideas. No, these people on the right are intelligent people who have looked it up and want to debate. You want to see a good debate. Pat Buchanan versus Sean Hannity or Peter Brimelow versus some open borders libertarian like uh, uh, Matt Walsh or something or someone from the Wall Street Journal. All the inner right fights are fascinating to me. These people are religious fanatics. They, they, for them it's sports.

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       It's The Dallas cowboys is their team and they want to fuck up your team. They don't want it to be like jared diamond who did guns, germs, and steel. Tons of flaws with that book. Steve sailor was begging him for debate. You wouldn't answer. Uh, J uh, jared Taylor, John Derby, Shire, all these three, even Richard Spencer, all these far right guys have made it clear. They'd love to argue with anyone on the other side and the other side knows that they will lose because their foundation isn't truth or information. Their foundation is just emotions. We're a nation of immigrants, so everything's racist. Oh, gays are people too. And you like you think, I don't think gays are fucking people. What is your point? I don't even understand your side of things. Right. Well I'm sure you saw that woman, excuse me, who's a, a a middle school teacher who uh, was a part of the protest at Berkeley.

Speaker 1:          00:56:22       Yeah. Yeah. She was on Carlson Tucker Carlson show and she was talking about fascism and she said that Milo is homophobic even though he's fucking gay. Yeah, he's a racist. Homophobe who sucks black cock. Yeah. It's so hilarious. And she was also saying that he promotes genocide. Like you can't just throw those labels out and that, that, I mean it's a clear example of what we're talking about. Cause those labels allow her to do anything necessary to get you out of the mix. And that's fascism. That is fascism, that's authoritative, authoritative thinking, authoritarian thinking in a, in a way that's eliminating someone else from expressing themselves because you have deemed them unworthy of expressing themselves. They're off. This is a racist, this is a homophobe. This is someone who promotes genocide. We will shut them down. Like that's, that's nonsense. And you could see from her talking on that show that she, she talks over him.

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       She doesn't express herself well. She doesn't have clearly thought out reasons for why she's saying he does these things. She doesn't have quotes and she's relying on, she doesn't say why it's so dangerous that he has these controversial opinions. She just says he's a Nazi, he's a racist, he's a homophobe. He promotes genocide. We're going to shut them down. But you can't just say that. You can't just label people cause someone could do that to you too. And they will. They will. That's the problem. I forget her name. Michelle give Ellis [inaudible] her name. Is she really in my car

Speaker 2:          00:57:46       by any means necessary. But I was game. I like playing with these people is play it through. They do that at AIA. They go, you want to be here? Okay, have a beer, then you're gonna have another beer, then you're going to get coke and heroin, blah, blah, blah. Play it through. Right. And I always say to these people, play it through. So he wants genocide. Trump wants denison. Okay? So he wants to kill what blacks and uh, Mexicans. So there's a van that drives to this house in New Orleans and picks up these black people and then they went, they go to a gas chamber. How does this work? What happens to their property? Is that divvied up? Does a state on that now? Like are you talking about the Cuban revolution? The irony is, by the way, whenever you start describing their universe, you end up describing Venezuela, Cuba, socialist countries, or you end up describing the Middle East.

Speaker 2:          00:58:28       Oh, he's going to want throw gays off buildings. He's going to, uh, start stoning women to death who are rape victims. You have your villains right there, but you're purposely ignoring him. And the other thing that's going on here, which is still a theory I'm working on, but there seems to be a disturbing peek at what a matriarchy would be like. And I'm seeing a lot of women in these movements who are sort of vindictive and cruel and like this woman we were talking about, uh, you know, you watch these videos and you hear like fuck them up, get 'em get 'em these women voices from behind the crowd and I called him shit chest

Speaker 1:          00:59:03       woman from the University of Missouri. Can I get some muscle over here? Remember her? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:59:09       She wants men to fight on her behalf. And you know, iron man has that blue thing in his chest. Yeah. I don't think women are evil. I like women are like ironman there magic. Right? But by ripping out that blue thing, you're ripping out the

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       ability to have children and be mothers and everything. And then you put in a piece of shit into iron man's chest. That's what feminists and like this woman are there shit chests and they're malfunctioning robots and they're like, this kill him. Milo wants genocide killing. So do you think that they're imitating what they think are patriarchal societies? They're doing their version of it and that's what they're doing with this. The whole matriarchal posturing. Yeah. It's like Clark Kent, I want to run an article. Ah, I'm writing Christian. No, you're not ready it. And you go clerk, simmer down, dude. You write your article. I'm doing mine. No. And he crunches. Oh, there's not a whole lot of matriarchal societies in the animal world other than hyenas. I try it. There's a few of them. There's a few where the females are larger than the males. A few bugs especially, but hyenas in particular, the female Hyena is, are much larger than the males.

Speaker 1:          01:00:17       Even at fake dicks really have a pho penis. He has this big large tube, fake Dick that hangs down. They actually give birth out of it and they climb on top of the males and they fucked him. And the speculation when there's a lot of speculation as to why the females are bigger, but one of them is that they think that she has to be bigger because Cayenne is are so goddamn ruthless. They eat their babies. Oh, so the female has to go get the fuck away from the baby cooked up when she gets on top of books, you pieces of Shit. It's my baby. I mean, there's no more, you know, no pun intended, dog eat dog world than a fucking Hyena world. You're out there fighting for scraps with lions. Yeah. Well, I actually have described to Antifa and these people as hyenas because that thing I was talking about at Berkeley where there are guys went in and said, I thought you guys were like tough or something, was his exact quote.

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       And they're going get him, get him, fuck him up. And then the guys sort of give up because no one wants to fight them. They start walking away and then someone runs up behind him, knocks him out with a flag pole as they're screaming these Italian slogans, by the way, like, no fuck. She's thought [inaudible] oh from the 1920s are having fun. They knock yet game there. Larping and then knocked him out. And then as soon as he's out, the hyenas come out and then they start kicking his unconscious body and they start grabbing their, really? Yeah, it's online. You can find it. Oh, ugly savages. The scary thing, man, you're going to invite right wing people to, to do the same thing and you're going to get some, some veterans and you're going to get some fighters and you can do, and it's, it's gonna.

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       It's gonna be horrific man. It's going to be horrific. And again, you start kicking their ass and then they're going to come back with weapons and people are going to show up with guns. It always leads to someone showing up with guns maybe. And if this keeps going and these, these protests, especially the things like the Milo protest, I mean maybe now that Milo has been humiliated and it at least temporarily side tracked or put down for a bit while he has to rebuild. Maybe someone can come along and have reasonable dialog and do some sort of a campus be I don't like it. Why is he doing these things on campuses? First of all, I don't think he gets paid for most of them. What? My theory with Milo is a, I think his eyesight's getting worse. His glasses are getting thicker and thicker and he's sorta going, this is my moment to make an impact. So he's just like, you think he's going blind? I think so. Yeah. You just theorizing this. Yeah. He's only like 28. Yeah. But you look at him, he's just can't reading glasses. They're insane. Really? Yeah. And they're getting thicker. Maybe it's stress, stress, stressing his eyes worse. Um, I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       I can't think it would be good. But I think he's trying to make a maximum impact in a short amount of time because you think he doesn't have much time left. That's such a way. He seems healthy. Totally wrecked eight. In fact, when we were in Orlando, we made out at the site of the, uh, you guys made out at the Milo to offend Muslims. Wow. So I said, what was, I did a big speech about freedom and funny states in this America delicious strawberries. Well, at least he freshens breath up before no gaze just tastes better.

Speaker 1:          01:03:27       I said, fuck is lamb. And then we made out at the site of the Orlando shooting to the Noi Muslims, but we had armed guards and stuff. And I said, all right, I want to make sure these guys are scoping out the rooms and shit. And he goes, I don't care if I die, I'll happily die for this. I was like, well, I do care. Actually. I've got three kids. What does, is it Neil Ism or nihilism? I always say it wrong. I always say nihilism, nihilism, that nihilistic sort of instinct that he has. He has a burn it all down instinct. And I think he has that with his life as well. And I think a lot of that, um, I'm playing some serious bro psychologists here. You know, some armchair psychology from someone totally unqualified, but you've got to attribute that to in at least in some ways being molested as a child.

Speaker 1:          01:04:13       I would imagine that his experiences that he's calling positive experiences when he was young, in many ways those could have potentially damaged him and also being young and being homosexual and being rejected. All of those things wreck havoc and you develop this, fuck you, I want to burn it down. And this is one of the strategies that he sort of adopted that strategy to be this guy who was very difficult for like he's, he's gay, he's an English gay guy who's a right winger and mean it's, it's so baffling to them. They don't know what to do. They hate it because they see blacks and gays as their little pets and they like putting them on the front lines and going look good who were helping. And then when one of them defects to the other side, they become particularly outraged, but very few defect at the level that he's defected.

Speaker 1:          01:05:04       Right? I mean, he turned around and started attacking direct guy who bankrupted buzzfeed with the Hulk Hogan lawsuit. Peter Thiel, is that his name? Teal. Teal. Teal. Uh, the silicon valley billionaire. He's on trump's sort of board, right, isn't he? He's one of the people that trump has appointed to help him with technology or something. I think there's some sort of, see if he could find with it. It's Polish it up. Jamie a, there's some sort of a, a, a position that he has. I mean, he's an interesting one cause he's a gay man and he's a hugely successful entrepreneur, billionaire character. So He's, he's a weird one too. Like these guys that get that they're supposed to, like, if you're gay, you should be on the left. If you are, you know, if you're, you know, uh, transgender, you should be on the left. Like when Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn Jenner and steady still against gay marriage, everybody was like, what about fuck?

Speaker 1:          01:05:54       What in the fuck? He's a trump supporter and he's against gay marriage. But now call me Caitlyn, and this is my favorite part was when they asked him like, uh, like ellen, like really sort of grilled him on it and he goes, we're all more of a traditionalist or you definitely aren't you? Fuck, well that makes sense to me though. Cause if you see women as so special that it's a major thing to go over there, then you must have a 1950s view of a lady that's a Dorothy Day girl with a poodle skirt doing the vacuuming because liberals and college students just go. You and I are chicks, so they don't see it as a long jump, but Bruce Jenner sees it as this massive pole vault. Can I Peter Thiel? Yeah, sure. Peter Thiel, Teal ads, uh, allies to trump transition. So it says, starting to make his mark on trump's transition team teal, a billionaire investor and facebook board member joined the transition team days after the election and gradually bringing in other members of his circle.

Speaker 1:          01:06:53       While teal clashed with Silicone Valley during the campaign by endorsing trump early, this group may be the strongest or only bridge between the tech industry. And the president elect, this is to me, while Gavin's painting, this is to me the most volatile time that I can ever remember. Like the most vulnerable I've felt like our country is like as a nation, like as a structure, as a traditional structure like president and vice president, Congress and Senate. Now that Gavin's returning, I was just saying that I think this is the most vulnerable I've ever felt like this country is in terms of like its structure. Yeah. I just see it as a soldier divided cleanup. I feel great. Yeah. Why do you think it's a cleanup and in what way? Uh, trump hiring people as heads of departments that hate that department. I hate the government. I want it reduced to almost nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:07:52       Right? So when you have someone in the Department of Education that likes charter schools and hates public schools, I go get in there. Just start dismantling the unions, the teachers' unions. Start tearing them to shreds, make it possible to fire a teacher. Let's get the free market. And that is a huge, wonderful, that is a huge issue. I have a friend whose daughter is going to the school and he is absolutely furious because the teacher has tenure. You literally can't fire the most. They commit some sort of a felony and this woman doesn't give a fuck about her classes and he was describing like how negligent she is as a teacher and how how careless and how little effort she puts into it because she has the class, it's hers, it's like a free paycheck and she's just not the type of person that's committed to our work and she can't be fired and he's so furious and so frustrated with the public school system and how it all works at.

Speaker 1:          01:08:43       He's gonna pull his daughter out and put her in a private school now. Yeah, I had to do that too. I got to, I call it the $40,000 posted note. I've got to post postnatal my daughter's homework and said, you're awesome while you are. No Way. Yup. Public schools. She also got no markers because my daughter used markers on our homework. M R K no markers. This is a teacher. Yeah. Wow. Well, if you don't have that squiggly red line underneath your text, it's very difficult to tell what the fuck you just said and what's wrong with it. Does it, does this trump thing bother you with the tax returns? No, not at all. That bothers me a lot. Really? Yes. Cause I want to know how much money he makes from Russia. He's got significant business ties with Russia apparently. W were you concerned about Hillary's ties with Russia?

Speaker 1:          01:09:26       No. Look, look, mom, I'm know Hillary's porter by any stretch of the imagination. I think she's impossibly corrupt. I think she represents, um, this system where people get to a place of influence and they use that influence to make massive amounts of money by giving speeches to bankers and finding ways to profit and look there. They're shutting down the Clinton Foundation, right? You're aware of that, right? Yeah. Like this is, yeah. I mean, this, this, this, the whole thing was a big, as soon as she hasn't had any power anymore. Gee, how weird at this whole thing is shutting down. It's a pay to play scheme. Yep. And that's really what it's been the entire time and everyone knows that, but it's one of those things where the left didn't want to talk about it because it weakens our position. It strengthens the right, but by not talking about it, it makes them extremely vulnerable as well.

Speaker 1:          01:10:08       So I'm the, I'm no supporter of anything that she stand for or bill stands for, especially now, but he, he makes me nervous. Their skin, they're spending more money on travel and he complained how much of Obama spent on travel. The trump will have spent more money on travel in the first seven months than Obama did in the entire eight years was in the White House because he's flying back and forth tomorrow, Lago, back and forth to Manhattan. He's doing whatever the fuck he wants to find his kids when his kids have to fly to do business forum, when they're opening up casinos, it's all secret service. Everything is being done with taxpayer money. It's, he is the most very consistently threatened president in history. I mean that the Daily Mail printed this, no, sorry. The Daily News in New York printed this list of how many people would have to be killed to get to a Democrat and they go, we're just throwing this out there just so you can see.

Speaker 1:          01:11:01       We'd have to be this person and then there's the vice president and the secretary, then the postmaster general blah blah, blah, blah, blah, and you go, why are you publishing hit lists? Why would they do that? Because the pizzas come in. I've seen it all over the place. People will read it. Comedians are talking about it too, like let's just take them out and you just got to be taken out. Comedians are saying more said something strange could happen before some crazy horror said. Something like that too. Well that was Sarah Silverman too. She had this thing she was, she was advocating, she was saying that once the military steps in the mad king will no longer be there. Like what? You do not want the fucking military to run the country ever. Do you understand what that means? If they can kill the president, that can kill you too.

Speaker 1:          01:11:40       Do you? You have to be absolutely out of your fucking mind to want the military to step in and run the country. You are advocating a military dictatorship because by the way, that's what happens in the military comes over when they take over. You don't get a vote. There's no fucking vote now that's all gone. The people with the guns are now running things and they do whatever the fuck they want and it's very inconvenient for them to have to sit down and listen to people who go to Largo on Tuesday night to watch Sarah Silverman speak like it's very inconvenient for them to take your opinion into consideration and they're not going to, well, the implication there too is that she's running it like General Brigadier Judd Apatow is calling up the commands of God. General Patton Oswald just don't think they found the tanks. They haven't thought it through.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       They never think it through because it's just religion. It's all platitudes. It's all mods and rockers made up. Shit. What's also, there's a lot of posturing online when you're making these statements online. You're doing it to not just because you have something to say, which I believe there's something there, but also because you want love. You want people to, to like what you're saying, you want people to retweet it. You want people to say, hey, that guy is really on the ball. That girl is really on top of politics. Yeah, you go girl. You know you're saying the right things. Yeah, fuck him. We've got to get up. But they're, they're not, they're not thinking this thing out. You had a contest. There's a fucking contest. The person that you had go against the person that you were, you didn't want to win sucked. So the person who won won the fucking contest.

Speaker 1:          01:13:12       You can't just come in and say, now the military has to take over because I don't agree with the results of the contest. We have a country, the country is filled with 350 million people, uh, enough with your shitty electoral college system decided that this guy should win the contest. He Won. He won fucking fair and square. Whether or not the Russians were involved in hacking the DNC. Take that aside, look at it for what it is, because what the Russians exposed was fucking corruption. And I don't, they are obsessed with these emails and I go, you know, that's not what lost it for her. There was no real smoking guns and those emails there was, what's her name, uh, donate, uh, to come up with questions for CNN. There was jake tapper looking dirty and there, there was a jake tapper looked dirty from, uh, he looked like he was getting questions, talking points from the DNC.

Speaker 1:          01:14:03       There was shit up. Yeah. There was, um, there was also the, the very clear collusion where they were making that Bernie Sanders did not win the primaries. Right. That was where it was most disturbing to me because it's that leap through emails. Yes, yes. Yeah. I mean, she did something corrupt. Yeah. She, it's not the crops and they're saying, well, the Republicans didn't, didn't get exposed and well, the implication is that the Russians had something on them, but there was a deal. But how do you know that's the case? They might not have done anything illegal. That's also possible. It's possible. It's possible that if you look at the very minimal amount of things that were done by the DNC, there's just a few incidents. None of them landed anybody in jail. Right. So I think we can kind of agree that whether or not they are corrupt, they're fairly minimal, even though you are fucking with democracy.

Speaker 1:          01:14:52       I mean that's what you're doing when you're rigging the primers. You're fucking with democracy. No one went to jail. So the worst case scenario that they were a tribute that was attributed to them was still not enough to warrant a criminal investigation or jail time. Then you have the other side and you're supposed to assume that their side was more egregious or was it equal and we're just not exposed. Like what? Look, all the shit that was exposed. Look at all, look at that Billy Bush interview you're telling me that sounded worse than anything that was exposed on the other side as far as like public opinion, it seemed to resonate more. I don't know why it was just a dumb joke, but it seemed to be, that's what that march was. It was a pussy joke. March. Look, trump won because of transgender bathrooms. He won because of the grievement industry.

Speaker 1:          01:15:31       He won because of the liberal media spinning stories. He won because we're all sick of governor obamacare. Obamacare was a lot of factors. There was so much animosity built up against the establishment that when Rodney dangerfield showed up in, in Tartan Pants, and today you whoa, Whoa, whoa, someone stepped on a duck. We all went, that fucking guy. I want him to come in and just blow it all up and let's start from scratch. It doesn't leak. But the, but the ties to the Russians, that doesn't bother you at all? No. The fact that he won't release his taxes, it doesn't bother you at all? No, that bothers me because we should know where money comes from. But look at what they do. Look at this obsession with reframing. Things like Milo's sentence, uh, has been construed to mean he wants 13 year olds to have sex all the time with adults.

Speaker 1:          01:16:18       Uh, every time they get a, like w ann coulter said, our blacks are better than their blacks. She meant conservative. Blacks tend to be more well researched cause they get a hammering at Thanksgiving from their family and they're not conforming to the majority of their race. So they tend to be heartened that gets construed into ankles or thinks we still have slaves and blacks. So you can just see the way these tax returns, especially in an era where we seem to hate entrepreneurs and we seem to hate wealth. And me, I've heard so many people criticized trump saying he's a billionaire or the betsy devoss cause she's a billionaire and you go since when is that a fucking insult? That's the only thing everyone on earth wants to be. Well, okay. I mean you're kind of setting up a bit of a straw man with that because I don't think that's just what people are challenging and what people are upset about with trump with they're about is that they believe that he might be influenced by foreign governments that have a vested interest in controlling our democracy.

Speaker 1:          01:17:16       And that's what the Russian thing is scary. If he's making considerable amount of money in Russia and a considerable amount of money in China, you have to wonder whether or not he will be influenced by that financial tie, by those financial ties and whether or not that that will influence way the policy that it creates in this country. Whether or not he allows things to happen that we don't think should happen, just so that he can profit valid concern, but it's not proven yet. And if it is proven, we'll drag him out of the White House by his heels. But don't you think that the only way you're ever going to really prove that is by seeing his taxes? You have to, you have to see his tax returns and how business works. We, that's why I bring up this Auntie Auntie entrepreneurial age. Like with the bankruptcy laws in the nineties everyone was taking advantage of bankruptcy laws because the government was so bad at its job.

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       So they, uh, trump had to go on at the same with his manufacturing, his ties in China. I've tried to make things in America like toy dolls it, they were going to be 17 times the price if we didn't make them in China. So it wasn't like it would be a challenge. It just wasn't possible. Once that system is like that, you have to adhere to that system if you're going to eventually change it. And I think people are going to see these tax returns, they don't know what the fuck they're doing and they're going to go, oh, here's proof that he's in bed with these people. But well, some people are going to be able to analyze them and come up with accurate assessments of where, where he's being influenced and where he makes money and why that can be a problem and why could be a conflict of interest.

Speaker 1:          01:18:41       But we should be able to have that information. Every single president before him has been forthcoming with that information. He, yeah, every day was going to release a financial loser maybe, but he said he was going to release it up until the moment where he got in and then he said, no, why should I? I guess I dunno. It's, you don't think they should force him to release the tax returns? She to me, like these, these people, they, they're, they're worried about foreign influence. We had Hillary, uh, showing us her foreign influence, rainy, and we showed her selling the presidency, having Bill Clinton do a talk about this doesn't exonerate trump, right? No, but where were you then? You pronounce it of you, right? You're right. We're not talking to them. Right. We talking to me and I'm, I'm not a left wing hillary supporter and in any way, shape or form.

Speaker 1:          01:19:27       I just think that if we're going to have a president, we have to have some pretty universal rules that we follow. And one of them should be, the president should be beyond influenced by foreign governments. And there's really, there's really not a whole lot of ways to tell what's influencing you other than tax returns. So you, you're implying that in these tax returns, you're going to see massive checks from rush. I'm not saying that. I'm saying we should find out. I mean, you should. Absolutely. You're, you're the president. You shouldn't, it's, it's very eroding. It erodes the public confidence. If you hide that, if you conceal that, if you don't tell us where you have your money stored, you don't tell us where you're, where you're making money, where you have bank accounts, where you, where you know there's, there's a lot of factors involved in a guy like trump was running a massive global empire and if, if we don't know like where he's being influenced through his financial connections, I feel it, I feel like that's really problematic and I think it's, it's, it's a real dangerous thing to deny it because it's always been, it's always her spin, what presidents do and we've always said it was a good thing and I always thought it was law.

Speaker 1:          01:20:35       I thought it was mandatory. I never knew that there was a way to get around under a, they're under the being an under audit right now that was over. He says it's still going and it's been going since the 70s or something like that or that atl area. So he just has to keep the audit going then it doesn't have to tell us how much. Yes. I mean, I understand your logic. I just, the bigger picture here is I think that people don't understand that he took a major hit and uh, becoming president financially. And I think that was part of the appeal. Americans went, Holy Shit, you're putting it all on the line for us. But he's not losing tons of my sons are running the business and they're doing a great job doing it took a huge hit and none, oh yeah. How so is residences the golf courses?

Speaker 1:          01:21:14       Well, that Mara Lago, the attendance is up and they raise the, uh, admission fee to $200,000 a year. That's how much it costs now to join there. My understanding is the brand with his residencies and his golf clubs and everything else took a major hit. And I understand that because it's like if you're in New York and you say, we're up mets, mattress company, well it doesn't, it's not that people are anti med, but now Yankees fans don't want your mattress. So Z, anything political when you're a brand like that is going to lose you 50% of your followers. And he went on a limb and if you'd lost the election, he still would have had that brand damage without any of the benefits and what he saw and put everything on black and they went, I appreciate you risking that. Has that been proven that his brand has been damaged?

Speaker 1:          01:21:56       Like if there's been any studies of like attendance or a residency's dropping that shit up. It wasn't the people that owned condos in one of the trump buildings tried to change the name in New York. They literally ripped the word trump off of their building. They did do that, right? Yep. Yeah, they had construction and these are people that own condos in that building. Right. So it's a, it's a place where you buy the New York. So weird like that. You buy your apartment. It's so strange. But they pulled the trump name down. Oh, whose, whose idea is that and how do we get away board all agreed it was a democratic decision and they said, we don't want to sell. They probably don't want to be targeted to, because I was there right after the election. I just happened to be there because of the UFC was there and Madison Square Garden right after the election.

Speaker 1:          01:22:41       So I walked to the gym and when I came back it was like, why we're in the gym, the the riots or the parade? The march started and so we walked back right in the thick of it and they were parked out in front of the trump tower, just fucking scream and a bunch of fucking losers. I saw the project, k, k, k, racist, sexist, anti gay. His guy just kept screaming that. Where did that even come from? They, they did another thing where they, they, first of all, they dance up freedom outside of Mike Pence, his house. He's not even there. Like he gives a fuck. He never said gaze can't dance. And then they just do that in New York. They start making out with each other in front of the trump building. Like he's going to go, oh, stop it. Stop it army. Oh, I can't see Gargamel from the smurfs.

Speaker 1:          01:23:27       I hade that. Well, it's the same thing we were talking about earlier with labeling Milo a Nazi and a fascist and homophobic and promoting genocide. If you just say those words and defined someone, you immediately put them in a nice box that you can attack. Right? And so by someone you, this guy was right next to me fucking screaming it. Donald Trump KKK, racist, sexist anti day. This was hilarious. He saw a black guy come in, he starts yelling, black lives matter, black lives matter. I was like, oh you son of a bitch. You fuck. They come up with this concept that the president is pro hate. So then they go, hey trump, I'm against hate. And he goes, that's nice. So they build a straw man and then they're attacking him and letting him on fire and the rest of us are going, I don't care that your lighting is scare crow on fire. You look fucking ridiculous. Well it's, it's not empowering their cause to be

Speaker 1:          01:24:24       exaggerating about his stances on things like gay rights or any of these other things. It's not empowering. So when you say he's KKK, when you say he's anti gay, when you say he's racist without like real proof, like you could say that he has said some very racist things about some Mexicans. You can say that. No you can't. Well, you could say that you just talking about all the rapists and murderers that are coming over from Mexico who crossed the border, the women get raped. They're at the point now where these women just take contraception. Uh, as part of the deal, it, it's almost like it's not rape at this point because it's a currency. Let's see. You're talking to people that are coming across was saying they're sending they're rapists.

Speaker 3:          01:25:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:25:05       Uh, and they are a Mexico as an program where they send their criminals over the board that he did a good job of expressing that if that's what people really want to say. And I think he could have been more measured and he could have done it in a way that would, but that's not how he talks. He could've done it in a way that would have removed any doubt as to what his intentions are. How he feels about people, right? But it is chest like sometimes he talks like an idiot, they're doing bad things and then

Speaker 3:          01:25:30       okay

Speaker 1:          01:25:31       you realize four days later, Holy Shit, that was brilliant. So with the Mexicans thing, these Mexicans are rapists. You go what? And then you look it up and go, Holy Shit, 80% of these women get raped crossing the border by these coyotes. Holy Crap. And then another example of this, him being four steps ahead, is when he says he's trying to do this travel ban, right? Muslims are a threat to America. And everyone goes, that's crazy. And then he says, the press isn't reporting on the following terrorism cases, this, this, this, this. He lists about 20 so then the meeting he goes, that's not true. We reported on this, we were putting on that, we put it on the London bombing, we on Bengazi, we reported on this. And then he dupe them into talking about terrorism for three days straight. All of a sudden his travel ban looks pretty reasonable.

Speaker 1:          01:26:13       Ah, that's interesting. So he's off. He's often setting a trap for people that they come bounding into. Well, whether or not he's doing it on purpose or whether or not, just by finding things that he can say that backup his point, he's starting that conversation off in a way that they wouldn't ordinarily start off. It might have been what happened with Sweden, where he goes, look what happened with Sweden last night on a particularly dead night in Sweden. Now you could say, look how many blacks died in gang warfare today in Chicago. It might be none today, right? But the average is years to write. And when you look it up and you go, Holy Shit, 780 people died in Chicago this year. W is today the 22nd there was a significant event on the 21st in Sweden. Massive laughs. Yeah, yeah. Look, it's Sweden has got problems. Europe has problems there.

Speaker 1:          01:26:57       They definitely do. And whenever you have people from one culture that immigrate into another culture and they're disenfranchised and poor and they have a really not, so I'm just going to keep going with it. But, and they also have a really restrictive fucked up culture that they're coming from and they want to impose that culture on the people that live in Germany or wherever and they want women to start wearing long dresses and they treat them like they're whores. If they don't, that's all fucking real dangerous. They're from a different part of the world and it's a part of the world that hasn't changed much in a long time. And that part of the world, I mean you could call it culture, you can call it religious tradition, but whenever you're dealing with a part of the world that still has honor killings and female genital mutilation and you don't let women drive and you know you, you women aren't allowed to vote and you have this incredibly restrictive world that you are, your existing him and then you bring that world somewhere else, you're going to have a culture clash.

Speaker 1:          01:27:53       And you're seeing that. And this is, this is, you know, if you want people to be free and you want people to have the ability to integrate into a more free culture like America is, you also have to be honest about what the consequences are and you have to be honest about what kind of culture they're coming from. And as soon as you talk about that, you get labeled in Islamophobia. Soon as you talk about this incredibly restrictive, misogynistic culture that's based on an ancient, ancient series of rituals and beliefs. Do you become a racist and a bigot by talking about a reality like when they're not a race? You're talking about culture and I, it's important to make that distinction as a Western chauvinist that I think the West is the best. I don't care what race you are, but I don't think that other cultures are different. I think they're worse and Islam is 500 years behind us. We were shitty. We had witch hunts inquisition, we had the inquisition. They're doing, they're not caught up to us yet. They're not as advanced. And I think two big problems with them as far as progress, progress goes is the Koran is an exceptionally violent book. It doesn't have a 2.0 the way Christians do and no one ever talks about this. But they have a major problem with inbreeding. They

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       are marrying their first cousins again and again and again. And that makes your evolution group works. Is this true? Where are you getting that from? I never ever heard of ginnaty. I think it's called Muhammad said it's okay to marry your first cousin for real and you do that once or twice. It's pretty bad and you do it for 40 generations and now you're going back in time and look at Iran in 1965 mini skirts, woman doing chemistry with test tubes, driving around. Hi, you want to go to the Gogo hot later and now just garbage bags. Oh, Gregorian chants everywhere. They've gone backwards in time. And I blame obviously the, the courage and the culture and religion, but also I think inbreeding enables them to get hijacked by these radicals. I mean we've got, you think they can beat snakebites in America? Can you mentioned them taking over Christianity?

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       Do you think, well, there are people in America, right, that the do do that still. It's hilarious. But they're not taking over America. The way they took over of the Middle East you think is the same. They're the equivalent as far as their, yeah, I think Irshad Manji and uh, uh, the trouble with Islam, she says a weird group of Wasabi is just hijack their religion and sent it into the dark ages. And I go, yeah, but how were they vulnerable to hijacking Christianity? Couldn't be hijacked by the snake guys. So why, and I think a part of it was inbreeding. Uh, this is our own theory. No, no, no. Look at them and breeding major, major problem. Never heard this, but especially with immigrants in Britain, like the Pakistanis in London, they'll have all kinds of serious inbreeding problems because that's an even smaller sample size you're dealing with. Ha. And every time I bring this up, people go, Yo, what about white people hillbillies? They were in breeding or royalty. They were in breeding. And I go, yeah. And it went real bad. It was a bad move. Learned the hard way we saw it. Deliverance. Well, there was the first, I've heard of it, but pull it up. I'm, I'm sure. I'm sure you're not lying. You find anything?

Speaker 1:          01:31:03       Something on snopes popped up. So, oh, snopes, snopes. Snopes is, I've, once I found out about the origins of snopes and who's running snopes, the guy who married a prostitute and left his wife and didn't know the whole deal that guys partying. He married some woman who was an escort. You ever seen the story on snopes? Yeah. The guy who ran snopes ran it with his wife, left his wife for a prostitute. She's still in him because all the money he spent on prostitutes. And uh, now he married the prostitute and she's not a prostitute anymore. Now she works for snopes and uh, oh wow. I knew it was a husband and wife team. I didn't know that's how they met. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now. Well the, there was a husband and wife team and now it's a husband with the new wife. And then there are suing each other, the ex wife and the husband or suing each other over who gets the money.

Speaker 1:          01:31:48       Some big crazy story, but he's just got a big fucking smile on his face and he's hanging out with this girl. He used to be an escort and I find that distasteful unless it's Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. Cause they're gorgeous. And I like it. Well, I think it's the best looking guy. But the prostitute at one point in time, the Gow who, uh, worked as an escort, I should say, I don't want to be disrespectful. I dated an escort ones. Did you Holla while she was escorting? No. Post Post. She was molested as a kid. Ooh. So she, for sex for her, we had to go super intense, like public humiliation. She wanted me to slap her in a grocery store and stuff. Oh Jesus. Because intimacy had been ruined by dad. Oh. So that we had to leap over that and get right into mean stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:32:31       Fuck man. Yeah, it wasn't great. But that brings me back to what you were saying earlier. Let's just spitball here. Okay. Molestation gaze. Here's my theory. First of all, I think 1% of people are gay and 1% 1% in theory, like you were thinking 10 all the time. And it's crazy. It's fucking nuts. Told people that's not. So remember your classrooms, you'd have three classes. There was that one fe guy who wore lacrosse a few costs. There's a few, I mean it might be as high as five, but it's definitely, I mean, unless you're in some place with maybe some sort of a gas leak, well that's what we're getting at nature and nurture. So out. So there's, these are gays, these are lesbians. I think a higher proportion of lesbians are that way for getting from getting molested. And it's easier to go with a woman cause they're not as gross as Cox.

Speaker 1:          01:33:19       So I'm in a more nurturing and they're also been sexualized by our culture. Right? I mean, they're constantly on billboards selling things and the right, you know, and it's girls kissing girls is hot, you know, you can just get a strap on there. I can have a dude and I want to think of dad. I'm just totally spit balling here, making it up. I'm going to say a third of lesbians were molested. Right. That's a lot. I'm going to lie within the percentage of gays. Less than that. I'm gonna say a fifth, a fifth. This is talking out of my ass here. A fifth of gay. So it's possible that Milo was that way. Lena Dunham, sister Lena brags about molesting her sister. She's a lesbian now she has. Yup. Jesus. So maybe you get molested. It could be by anyone. And Sex, you know, brings you bad feeling thing.

Speaker 1:          01:34:03       When children experience sex, when they're not sexual, like when they're not, their hormones have been kicked in. They haven't reached puberty and they experienced sex at a very early age. They become hypersexualized. And they say that that's one of the things that happens to women that are molested. And they speculate that that could also be one of the things that happened to men when they experience a molestation by another man at an early age. And there's an imprinting that happens, Christopher Ryan, where the author of a sex at dawn has talked about this, but there's imprinting that happens during the formative years and I forget what those years are. I think he said between 10 and 14. But things that can happen during those years are they like, they like a lock in and that's where people develop fetishes and they develop all sorts of weird sort of like kinky sort of things that they connect to sex.

Speaker 1:          01:34:51       And it's because of the fact that your body and mind are developing your hormones kicking in. Yeah. Yeah. Makes Sense. Well, it's uh, it's, it's a disturbing trait and your job as a parent and as a society is to keep kids as pure for as long as possible. You want Santa to go as long as humanly possible. He wanted the Easter bunny. The, I don't, I even nine 11. My kids don't know what nine 11 is. I'm keeping that race to racism. They, I just want them to know that that guy has dark skin. I don't want them to know any of those other things. And we're living in a culture where we're normalizing so much decadence that we're destroying our own innocence in the process. Strap yourself in for this 70% of all Pakistanis are inbred and in Turkey the amount is between 25 to 30% more stillbirths among immigrants.

Speaker 1:          01:35:45       A rough estimate reveals that close to half of everybody living in the Arab world is inbred. A large percentage of the parents that this is blowing my mind. Large percentage of the parents that are blood. Where's this coming from? What does this website, I blog posted it before I came here. He gave media, but these are all the sources that went to this is a, this sources reproductive health journal.com. Uh, this is a BBC investigation that went to it. So, so listen to the BBC investigation in Britain several years ago revealed that at least 55% of the Pakistani community in Britain was married to a first cousin. The Times of India from that in quotes, this is thought to be linked to probability to the probability that a British Pakistani family, British Pakistani family is at least 13 times more likely than the general population to have children with the recessive genetic disorders.

Speaker 1:          01:36:34       Holy Shit. Bbcs research also discovered that while British Pakistanis account for just 3.44% of all births in Britain, they accounted for 30% of all British children with recessive disorders and a higher rate of infant mortality. What in the fuck Labour Party MP has called for a ban on first cousin marriage. Medical evidence shows that one of the negative consequences of inbreeding is a 100% increase in the risk of stillbirth. One study comparing the Norwegians and Pakistan showed that the risk of child of the child dying during Labor increases by 50%. Wow. That is insane. I also read somewhere that's a lot of the symptoms of inbred people are irrational rage fanaticism and they end up just describing isis. Look at what it says here that um, with the, uh, the Iq points, it says findings. Unintelligence research shows that if one parents are cousins, if one's parents or cousins, intelligence goes down 10 to 16 Iq points.

Speaker 1:          01:37:44       The risk of having an Iq lower than 70 criterion for being retarded. In quotes, they using that word, who uses that word? They use it like that. I'm noticing that you use like I've always done it. I don't think it's a medical distinction. This is a real website. The fuck can we read it from? Did they say no? It says retarded. Retarded in quotes. He had a suit. Their legal, that is the medical definition increases 400% among children from cousin marriages. Well, let me say that again. The risk of having an Iq lower than 70 increases 400% amongst children from cousin marriages. An academic paper published in the Indian National Science Academy found that the onset of various social profiles like visual fixation, social smile and sound seizures, oral expression in hand grasping are significantly delayed among the newborn inbred babies. What in the fuck could name for a band newborn inbred babies?

Speaker 1:          01:38:43       Yeah, that's our punk or band. I ever heard one. Wow. Jesus Christ. Then why don't we know this because I've never don't like the truth. Islamophobia. They don't like being called Islamophobia, but even discussing it like we're going to be called Islamophobic for even bringing this. I know and I'm glad you read that from a reputable site, so it's not a Joe Rogan and Gavin McInnes is called Muslims retarded. This is PJ media. I don't know what that is, but let's find out if there's other corroborating or dissenting sources. Like Pajama media is a, a a well established network of champions or what you wear when you want to be serious about problems with Islam. If you wear your footie pajamas and he gets out of the basics, people are scared of genetics too, cause it gets into eugenics and they, they get uncomfortable, but it gets into racism too.

Speaker 1:          01:39:33       I come from a Shitty Glaswegian family and my uncles were drunks and maybe coming from a shitty group, you, you develop this immunity to fear of your group sucking like, I don't care what you say about roofs. I'm battalion mostly Italian. I'm one quarter Irish and fucking I came from a line of savages. They're there. Eight people, you know, it was a good percentage of my ancestors and relatives that I know that are fucking ape people and I can say that cause I know them and I come from them and I have eight people instincts that I fight off every goddamn day or my life. Man, the first time I came here you were trying to separate your spinal cord cause you had crushed it from choking people out. While I'm not trying to separate it, I'm trying to relax it and uh, decompress it. Some sound like doctor Zay us right now, but I've worked, I did, I worked at, it's great.

Speaker 1:          01:40:20       Now my back works wonderful. I stretched out. My philosophy is I don't care what the truth is, no such thing as hate fax to me. Let's hear it. And I was talking to the facts and they might be uncomfortable for you, but they are facts, the truth and it's best for everyone. Let's talk about this. A surgeon recently and I, he's, he's trying to accrue a DNA database that would just sort of like going into the singularity, it would be like becoming God and you would be able to tell from a baby if a baby is going to have a propensity for lung cancer and you know right out of the gate and he, he's scared of this concept

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       because he's worried it will affect insurance policies. They'll demand to see ya a smear some of your spit and they'll go, oh fuck this. We're not insuring you. You, you have a 40% chance of prostate cancer and 50% chance of this, the point of insurance. Cause then insurance gets real weird. It's not a gamble anymore. It's like you could see the car. It's like, let me see your cards. No, I'm not gambling. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, now it's just a bank account. Isn't that kind of what insurance is, right? It's like I look at you, Hey Gavin, let me take your blood pressure. Well, uh, yeah, a cough. Okay, let me hit your knee with this little rubber mallet. Everything seems okay. Hey, how are you sleeping? Sleeping pretty good. Wow. Okay. I'm going to give you a positive checkup and you bring it to the insurance company and go, look, everything checks out.

Speaker 2:          01:41:36       You're going to insure me. They're like, hmm. All right, we'll take a chance. But it is taking a chance. But do you smoke? Oh, you smoke. I don't like my odds there. Do Drink. I don't like my odds. Well, as we're getting smarter, we're turning into those, those chicks in the hot tub, in minority report, and sooner be able to just go, I can't and chill. You, you're dying on the way home today. Oh No. I say to him, I go, fine. Let's get it out there. The free market will figure out insurance for the doomed, uh, some sort of catastrophic policy, but there'll be more money over here to even it out. Information has to come out. We need this information. But inbreeding, I think it explains the hijacking of, of Muslim religion. You know, Hasidic Jews have the same problem, but they, because they're aware of this and the truth is out.

Speaker 2:          01:42:21       They have all kinds of elaborate DNA tests. They do on each other. Not everyone takes it, but, but rabbis will encourage this for us to check you out and make sure you're not related and encourage this marriage because it makes the most genetic sense. I had no idea you, you blew my mind with that information. I'm, I'm hoping that Jamie's going to pull up something that shows that that's a right wing hate group that's infiltrated this statistics and there does seem to come on a lot of right wing websites. I'm trying to find more sources, but trying to find another source. So just try to find another source and we'll continue to talk about other genetic things. Have you, are you aware of Crispr? You know, that's some crazy shit and they've, they've been given the green light to go ahead and start working on human fetuses.

Speaker 2:          01:43:00       I actually had this crazy theory in church the other day where I thought, is it possible that we're in heaven? Like, you know how the concept of Heaven is unfathomable, right? It's something that's totally different from where we are now and it's this infinite universe thing that our brains can't handle. And then I was thinking, wait a minute, this sounds like a sperm trying to figure out what earth is, right? Maybe the sperm was us being born was dying. Now we're alive here on heaven and we're slowly getting closer and closer to perfection. I mean lifespan has been getting better. The quality of life has been getting better. We're going to die soon, but in like 50 generations with crispers and all this incredible genetic information, soon we might be able to just be like, we all is. Usually we have cured your liver cancers. Well it's going to get really weird because they're kind of be able

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       to integrate the, the human beings that are here today with not just communication, not just visual information, but some sort of computer language. Jamie and I were just talking about this yesterday where we were talking about emojis and you know, and this is something that has been brought up before. The emojis are in many ways a lot like hieroglyphs and that they, you can say something with emojis that it can kind of translate what you're thinking without an actual language. And we're saying we're going to get down to, the only words you say are like yes and no. Like yeah. And know like nods and affirmations and confirmations and the, the language that we speak could be some sort of a weird universal emoji based language that's just expressed from mind to mind through some neural implants or some fucking snapchat glasses. We were, I mean, we're not too far away from something really bizarre and paradigm shifting like that.

Speaker 1:          01:44:50       I remember when downloading your brain was just science fiction movies and you know, you talk to people our age about their dead grandfather and they go, I have this black and my photo and I have this letter. He wrote the newspaper in 1896 that's all I got my life. My kids will never be able to read all the articles I've written or watch all the videos I've done. They'll, they'll never get through them all. They can watch them for 100 hours if they're bored. But they'll, there's way more of my brain permanently out there in the cosmos than they could ever want. Oh yeah, for sure is and everything. So the next generation, your dad isn't really going to die and just hang out with them whenever you want. Well, I'm sure you're aware of Ray Kurzwell and you know Kurzweil's thing is that he wants to somehow or another recreate his father cause his father died when he was young and he has some information about his father and he has some DNA that obviously is his and he has, you know, photographs and memories and he wants to figure out a way to literally recreate his father and have a conversation with them that I know you, I know you're an atheist, right?

Speaker 1:          01:45:58       No. Oh I am a nothing. This is, I feel like, you know, the beginning of atheists where he drinks that thing and then he deteriorates and goes into the water. That's what I think the big bang was. It was this beautiful microchip that just started the first domino and everything else. He's going to this place like the singularity is near this incredible perfection that we're headed to. And there's all these checks and balances along the way. Like I was reading about Audrey Hepburn the other day and she, um, was super skinny, right breakfast at tiffany's chick. She grew up in I think, uh, the, uh, Holland during the war and the Nazis Cutoff Holland from all supplies. So they were forced to eat lips and they, a lot of them, hundreds of thousands of them starve to death. And Audrey Hepburn was from that world and she was a skinny chick who didn't need a lot of food.

Speaker 1:          01:46:47       And then all of her ancestors kids became obese, big giant fat pigs. And they say it could have been genetic memory where they, their bodies went, Holy Shit, you found Doritos. I'm going to hold onto this cause you're never gonna find one again. And then you get an a, and I'm noticing this in La with all these Mexicans I see everywhere, they seem more obese than the general populace. And I think they have genetic memory from a generation or two ago where food was scarce and they, their bodies hold onto it more thoroughly. We see this with the American Indians all the time. It's a major diabetes problems send its genetic memory where these are the checks and balances your, you're at the fact that a cell can remember this generation is like you ever heard cell memory where the you get an eye transplant and all of a sudden you're seeing the guy that killed that guy.

Speaker 1:          01:47:38       I've heard stories and out but I don't know if it's ever been proven and it's still in the got to look it up to prefer my brain. People getting organ transplants as well where they have hungers, like they have a hunger, a hunger pangs for something that they never craved before. Right? It's, it's not, it's not known as big foot shit. It is known as as a, I think it was on 60 minutes. But I know genetic memory is a real thing and I just see all of this as part of the bigger picture as we, you know, checking balance ourselves, constantly improving. And the left seems to always deny that, that there's this 45 degree line. Even in the stock market, if you invested right before the Great Depression and you had the patience to wait 10 years, you still would have been up. So all the dips we've had, it's always been improving, improving, improving, improving.

Speaker 1:          01:48:24       Yeah. Well there's definitely some memories that are passed on between parents and children and they're trying to figure out exactly what's the mechanism. But they don't know. What they do know is that they've done these studies with mice and it's really fascinating. They take mice and they put them in this cage that has a floor that they can give an electric shock to it. And then they release a citrus smell, that nice smell, the citrus smell, and they zap them. So these APP their feet. So then these mice have children. The children have never had this experience before. The children are the grow to full size and then they spray the citrus smell and they fucking panic. No Way. They've never been zapped before, but they fucking panicked. They have an immediate reaction to it. See, when I hear that, I go, how can people not believe in God?

Speaker 1:          01:49:06       Does it? Well, I don't know if it's a god thing. I think it's a learned reaction to genetics that passed on from parent to child. That is the reason for instincts. So reason why we have the rational fee is magic. It is kind of mad at me for what is that magic? I mean, what is, what is the universe itself? I mean, what is the magic that makes you see me? What does the magic, but what does God, I mean it's a weird limited expression to to sort of make some sense out of something that's beyond our feeble mind and imagination at this point. I don't know. I don't know if it's necessarily, there was an article going around about a month ago where they said, we may all be in the matrix. This could all be some sort of giant experiment and uh, I go wait. It had to have discovered God, that's what it is.

Speaker 1:          01:49:52       It's the matrix. It's the first domino. It's the, the machine about God. You're not talking about a guy who lives in the clouds with a harp trying to get a grip on it, right? That says drawing a face on the guy. Like, like you think it's a gun? Wilson and castaway. You're just putting a face on a, on a baseball glove, volleyball. Do you think it's a guy? Like what are you guys sure guy? I don't know. When you trainee if God, God is a really fat German guy with a dress and he's got a deep voice and he eats lipstick. He's got lipstick all over his teeth. Man Hands. He's got a twitch chat all the time. It's really nice. Got Chipped Nail Polish on its toes and just disgusting feet shoved into some high heel shoes. Do you, what do you think it's a physical entity?

Speaker 1:          01:50:41       Do you think it's an energy clickable? I mean our meager of this whole sperm to human thing because the only relationship I can see in front of me, uh, that mimics this is a pilot is kind of human being we're the pilot is, right. So if you said to a sperm, so what is this earth man like? Does he wear a tie and the spring we just go that why does the, those aren't words, but it seems to me that like when you say something as God or you believe, you say you believe in God what you are, you're defining something but you don't even know what you're defining gratitude. You go to church and it's just about reverence and thank God that I'm here and I really appreciate it. That's Latin mass. You go to Latin mass and it's just like [inaudible] like I don't know what they're saying, but I'm in this incredible building.

Speaker 1:          01:51:35       It's blown. I was talking to Milo, but at once when he was last in New York and I go, it is kind of unusual. How good to these churches are. Like how beautiful there do you feel like when the, the the guy that the contractors were making them like the stained glass, it was like they're on adderall and they had this sort of divine intervention and they're like, holy fuck, I'm really good today. I was like, I can't leave a weld. It's carvings turning out. Have you been, she's described you've been to Rome. Yeah. Did you go to the Vatican? Uh, yeah. I think we went up to the wall. I can't remember if we went in or not. Oh God man. You got it. You want to talk about something that'll blow your mind as far as like the religious undertones and the majestic magnificence of its construction.

Speaker 1:          01:52:15       St Peter's Basilica. I mean I, the, the whole Vatican is incredible. The artwork is just amazing. I mean, were there for hours and hours wandering around. We had this really cool professor we hired as a guide. It was amazing. He told us all the history of everything. But when you get to St Peter's basilica and he was explaining how many hundreds of years it took to build and they're building all this shit with no electricity, no machines, no nothing. Everything is massive and perfect and beautiful. It's like you're looking at such an incredible work of art that's designed to inspire awe and reverence and the motivation behind building something like this fucking hundreds of years ago. It's, it's really, I think it's gratitude and you see this with my wife's American Indian and at all those ceremonies. It's a, we give things to the north. Yeah. We give thanks to the West.

Speaker 1:          01:53:05       We give thanks to the east and that's what church is. It's just like, I don't know the details, but thank you for that. While my hands work, thank you so much for this. Let's pray for other people. I think that's a great way to live. Life is living life with gratitude and I try to be thankful all the time. I'm a very lucky person and I've always been very lucky and I'm always very thankful to and I try to be very generous. I tried to be very thankful, try to be friendly as much as I can and all those things I think sort of build onto it, but to have it and define it and to put it into like a religion, that's where things can get awry because they can, they can get screwy when you're sort of defining things by this ancient set of rules.

Speaker 1:          01:53:44       That was sort of established before we really understood science before we really understood, uh, the, the laws of thermodynamics, the way the universe is formed, what we know now about the cosmos, it's just, there's so many variables that have to be taken into account when you're looking at an entire system, when you're trying to define what, what God is and what religion is, and then you look at how restrictive religion has been in the past and how many people have suffered because the discoveries that they had didn't jive with the ancient texts. He mean like Galileo and sure. All that stuff I guess. I mean the Catholic Church was, is very pro science and has been pro science for a long time. So as the Islamic church for the longest time, Islam was like the foundation of science and the foundation of literature. Like before, you know, like the, before Gaviscon came riding into Iraq and fucked up uh, Baghdad and turned the river red with blood and black with ink as they said, like they were some of the best scholars in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:54:46       It was like some of the best mathematics, some of the, the, the, the best writing. It had come out of the Islamic world and they had been conquered and destroyed. And so much of that was lost. And you know, the ebb and flow of these cultures to us seems like such a long time to go from 1200 to 2017 but in the course of humanity, it's a blip. It's a nothing. Maybe they're right. Maybe gays should be thrown off buildings to pick scientifically proved it. Maybe a lot of these rape victims are bitches that it should have stones thrown in the fall. Just kidding. Internet, you can't kid, man. There's certain things you can't kit about Gavin. You know what it has allowed, thinking about the whole Catholic versus Protestant things goes back to, uh, the ultimate core of all arguments, which is nature versus nurture.

Speaker 1:          01:55:34       And the Catholics say some people are better than others. Some people are special. The Protestants say we're all the same. Uh, that guy, the guy up there on that pedestal isn't better. And I vacillate myself like you for example, are you special? Are you magic? Are you blessed? Like you're on that show why your career has been so weird. It seems like every time you get thrown out of a plane, we come back a few days later and you've got a coconut stand and you're wearing a grass skirt and you're like, hi, come on in. These are where everyone sits for their, uh, their coconut juice. Um, and maybe you were kind of the Jew. Judaism seems to say that you're a chosen one. That there's some people who are picked by God, like that Davinci code thing with Tom Hanks where some people are just way better than others.

Speaker 1:          01:56:24       Like I was having dinner with Sean Lennon, but you got to get them on the shelf. Yeah. You were telling me one of the most interesting guys I've ever met in my life, but he was, he's a mason. Him and Vincent Gallo are masons and during one of his Doo Hickey's hope he doesn't mind me telling this, but there were these like it's so no snow to roll. Two guys, they're looking through like a wood thing and they invited him to the heavy shit. One that's like made a golden is through a book where you go upside down and you have to swim there and you've come out of your workload and your hold like a diamond sword or something. I'm just making that up. Right. I'm super fancy one and he's like, I didn't do it because that's not me. I don't feel like doing that. I'm not going to go to the fancy one.

Speaker 1:          01:57:01       I want to be with my boys and I was thinking later you have a, maybe you are that Ans Davinci code guys. Well this is my take on it. I think there's definitely nature and there's definitely nurture. I think both are factors and to go nature versus nurture to me seems simple. Simple. It seems too simplistic. It seems too silly because it seems to me like your, you're trying to pick a side. We're clearly both have massive amounts of animal. It comes down to percentages and I think they've discovered the frontal lobe where it, everything matters is 80 nature, 20 nurture. And we see this with identical twins separated at birth. One grew up rich and Paris. Yeah. There was poor in Detroit. Similar dogs. Husbands looked the same. Same car. One does film critic critiques. The other makes movies. She's aligned producer. They are basically the same person.

Speaker 1:          01:57:50       Hmm. Well there's definitely gifts, right? Some people are intellectually gifted when we know people that are just really fucking smart. They're just born really fucking smart. They're smarter than me. I talked to him. I go, Jesus. Yeah. And then there's other people that are athletically gifted like Michael Jordan. Like you can't, like there's not, there's not a chance in hell like a take a Jonah Hill. Jonah Hill could work every day. All Day for the rest of his fucking life. He's never going to play basketball like Michael Jordan. It is impossible if Michael Jordan never worked out ever, like never, like literally just kind of did normal stuff like everybody else does. Like man, went to the gym, took a spin class, he could probably jump way fucking higher than Jonah Hill. He could probably run way faster than Jonah Hill and he probably would be better at anything he applied himself to athletically because he's got a gift.

Speaker 1:          01:58:40       He's get clearly genetically gifted. You know? Uh, I think the same could be said of Karl Malone. Same could be said of Mike Tyson. The same could be said of a, a bunch of great athletes. Um, the same could be said of Brock Lesnar. They didn't, no matter what you do, you can lift weights all your fucking life. You're never going to be as strong as that guy who was the mountain drew thorn was named, can be Orson or whatever the fuck his name is. That gigantic mountain dew guy from game of thrones. Like that's a gift, man. That guy's gifted 100% and I'm glad you use sports as an analogy because the general understanding is there's this sort of line and it's a gray area and there's a guy who can throw a softball, a fast ball at 10 miles an hour or 20 miles an hour and it goes up to 100 and then there's a guy who can do 99 98 but I don't think it works like that with baseball.

Speaker 1:          01:59:26       I think there's like the 40 miles an hour people and then there's this floating bubble of the hundred mile an hour pitchers and these guys are magic. They are very special. They're the Davinci code. Children of Jesus. Well in fight and fighting in striking in particular, there is, well there it exists in grappling as well. There's strength and grappling that's like there's some people who have just freak strength, but I believe that that could be nurtured more than striking strength people when people are good hitters Stryker's like a guys who are power punchers empower power kickers. There's only so much you can teach someone. You could teach someone proper technique, but power is something that's just given to you by the great beyond and no one understands it. No one knows why you could take two guys. One of them looks exactly like the other one. They're built the same.

Speaker 1:          02:00:13       They're both have big muscles. They both have big hands and one of them can punch a hole through the fucking universe and the other one could barely make the bag move. It doesn't make any sense and no one knows why you could take someone in their body looks completely unimpressive, but when they hit people, people just go flat and no one knows why. Well, no, I don't believe transfer that hard truth to intellect. Yes, there's this myth that we all need to be educated. We all have to go to college. When my dad was young and Britain, you did your old levels at 13 and my dad had a high Iq. His brothers didn't. So they sifted through just like a pink floyd video and they sifted him over to a scholarship and private school and they sit at his brother's over to work in a printing press.

Speaker 1:          02:00:53       And they all did fine. They had good jobs and they were, they were taking advantage of their skills and then we came with this idea where everyone had to go to college and now to lower the bar so everyone can get in. We have all these retarded classes. There's a class at Nyu called 20 something where it's just about being 20 something done. Everyone there is 20 something and you go now you've just wasted your time by not admitting that some people are special and that's what I was getting at earlier with the Western culture thing. Some cultures are better, some are more advanced. There might be a satellite of people that are just magical. Like Jimmy Kimmel. He kept having his career shadowing when he was in sports radio. We had this woman above him was out to sabotage him. He got sent down the shitter.

Speaker 1:          02:01:37       Yeah. What it was. I heard that story. What was that about? Asking him about it? Some horrible con that tortured him every day and producer or something. Yeah. Wow. He's so talented though. Well, that's why I said that's what I'm saying. Like Michael Jordan, you throw them in Africa and there would be, there'd be like, you'll have to meet this man who is in the Congo. He got jump on Minnie and miles. His name is Juju or Jordan and he has like a leather basketball and I don't know what it is. I am so good at this. He would be flown over like Jeremy Lin or whatever and I think Jimmy Kimmel and you are the same. They just, they get fucked over. I've done it a million times. I've thrown my career down the toilet and then I just keep flying through the sewers and pup. I come out of another man hole.

Speaker 1:          02:02:18       Well you figured out a way now particularly with your show to let your personality shine through like to like your unique way of looking at things. Very thorough examination of the world around you in an honest take on and that also happens to be humorous. But I did that with advertising. I got involved in advertising advertising agency. He sold it for millions. Then we got fired cause I said shitty stuff about trainees. I pointed out they're mentally ill gaze. Well, what you pointed out was that there's a lot of regret and that was where people were getting really uncomfortable. And there's, there's a website, I think it's called trends, gender regret.com and there you cannot tell me that any sort of major surgery doesn't carry some sort of regret. When I was in my twenties I had hair transplants. I have a big scar on the back of my head.

Speaker 1:          02:03:09       You see that? Oh yeah. That's because they take a piece of meat or the back of your head with hair on it. Because my hair was falling out and I was on TV and I was like, fuck, if my looks go, I'm going to be poor again. I'm fucked. I'm losing my screen's radio. Yeah. Yeah. And so a while we were on hiatus, I had hair transplants. They take a piece of meat back here with take the hair and they move it all up in here. And the way I just, you know, it doesn't work because eventually the other hair falls out and it's just, you left with this mess. But yeah, I regretted it. It was a stupid thing to do and people make irrational choices that can become permanent and if you don't think that some people who decide that they would be happier as a woman and then become a woman and then are miserable because first of all, their hormonal profile has changed.

Speaker 1:          02:03:53       They don't have a penis anymore. They don't have their testicles anymore. They wish they could go back to where they were. You don't think that that's possible, that those people who have major surgery could also possibly have major regret. That is debt is dishonest, it's disingenuous and you are, you are adhering to an ideology rather than looking at something in a completely objective and and, and open and honest way. You're, you're using these people as pawns for your own virtue signaling and it's murder. It's like when you see toddlers, like at that woman's March, they had these toddlers thing with my pussy grabs back and you're looking at a three year old and you're going, Jesus Christ, that's child abuse. And I feel like the, these liberals are doing tranny abuse by normalizing such a drastic decision. And it inevitably, I know this is the guy you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          02:04:41       He's rights for the federalist all the time and he goes, what happens with these people as they have all these problems? Clearly you're not sick, you think, or a woman, but they also have bipolar and schizophrenia and manic depression and all these other things. They go, if I could just get rid of my cock and be a woman, it would be fine. Then they do that and for a month they're happy and then they realize, wait, the bipolar is still here. I'm still depressed. What the fuck have I done? Holy Shit. This isn't the cure all solution. Not only that, there's also this, there's a real problem and that you're not allowed to bring that up. Like we know when you look at the, the the average person, whether they're gay or straight, the average people, men and women out there in the world, there's a certain amount that are going to be schizophrenia.

Speaker 1:          02:05:19       There's a certain amount that are going to have all sorts of mental illnesses, depression, et cetera. There's a certain amount. When you start talking about transgender people, you are no longer allowed to take that into consideration and you must treat every transgender person is if there are 100% mentally healthy, which is insanely rare in regular people, people that are not transgender, cisgendered. If you were, when you use that term, you look at this gender. That's what I sent him, that article that got me and shit. I go, let's get the shit here. Okay, you're looking at what's his name and transparent Jeremy, whatever his name is, the actor. Sorry, when does that, what is his name? What does, the guy was [inaudible] board and you're supposed to look at them and go, you know that's an interesting struggle you're going through. It's Mrs doubtfire. I can't not laugh when I look at you.

Speaker 1:          02:06:06       It's comical and everyone just has this willful ignorance. Like I saw Laverne Cox on some dumb day today show type thing at the hotel earlier and he's sitting there with his legs crossed going, you want to tell the mcbeal? And so then I was so nervous, like didn't even slow, still suck my stomach in. And you're like, are we all pretending that you're not a dude? Who is the, who is Laverne Cox was on that show? A orange is the new black. I never watched that. No, me neither. But he's a famous Janet mock. There's Laverne Cox. They're all the top ones. It Caitlyn Jenner. And whenever you see them, you go, you're a dude. Uh, but a shirt. I'll sit here and clap and go like, yes, you're gorgeous. Oh my God. That is a problem. It's, it's, this is, that's a guy. Yeah. Wow. That's a huge guy.

Speaker 1:          02:06:50       Is that he a giant. Really? Yeah. And not a guy anymore. How long has she been a girl? I don't know. You never get the straight answer from these people. I think he has some pussy out of, of chopping their dick off she goes. He thinks well Caitlyn did, right? I don't think so. No. Oh yeah. Katelyn didn't, I mean did pussy out of it. Yeah. Yeah. You get it done. There you go. You go girl. It's a 10. If there be, if there comes a time where through crispr or some other new fangled genetic manipulation, you can turn a man to a woman and then back and forth and you really can be gender fluid. Like there's a, there's an instagram page about gender fluidity and one of the things it's like, I'm not a man. I'm not. Sometimes I'm a man, sometimes I'm a woman, but I'm always a human like, okay, you know, like, I don't know, it may be here.

Speaker 1:          02:07:38       That's another thing about I'm not a homophobe, I'm a homo board. I don't care who you fuck. Like when you make out in front of my building, have a nice French session. I don't fucking give a shit with Milo. And you see that, I see that sometimes it's black and white couples. Like in New York there'll be walking the chain holding hands and looking indignant. You know, high, we're in love. Got a problem with that. Oh congratulations. You're fucking someone you're attracted to ooze. We to go up there and blow minds, you're sucking your boyfriend's Dick. I'm stunned and I think that's why they get so mad too, is I go, you're not a snowflake. You're not transgendered. You're just a fucking dude. Well, when time moves on and once, we really do eliminate all the things that trouble us when it comes down to homophobia or racism, all these issues that they're really still do exist.

Speaker 1:          02:08:32       You're going to be left with the actual human beings themselves. So when no one is transphobic, when no one's homophobic and no one's racist, they can judge you for who you are. We're there, but we're not in a lot of ways because people get free passes if they are transgender. If they're gay, like a guy like Caitlyn Jenner saying that he's, he doesn't support gay marriage like that. You get a fucking free pass like you're getting a free pass you, but here's the best free pass. The caitlyn Jenner, God, she fucking killed a person. She slammed her car and it's some lady because she wasn't paying attention, slammed her fucking escalate and pushed her in at oncoming traffic and the lady died and no one brings it up. That's the freest, free pass of all took a life by completely being negligent. And that's the problem with this bigotry of low expectations.

Speaker 1:          02:09:22       You put these people on a pedestal until they can do no wrong. And they ended up doing wrong. I mean that hadn't been Milo to, he had to get out of jail free card. He could say whatever he wants and the next thing you know, he goes too far on the devil's advocacy with the 13 year olds sexual relationships. And you go, come on guys, let's just dial it in a bit here. We're all the same. Racism is over. Homophobia is over. Let's not sexism. Racism is over. I don't think it's over. I think there's plenty of racist people. Here's the deal with racism. Okay, I'm hiring. Okay, I'm checking out your resume here. Oh, you're an accountant. Oh, you want to, you want to make 80 grand a year. You saved your previous company 150 grand a year. Well, that's a great point for me.

Speaker 1:          02:09:58       I'm gonna make 70 grand a year just hiring you. I'm going to look like a champ. My job would be more secure. Uh, the company will make more money. I think we, oh yeah. Uh, I didn't know you were black. Uh, you're going to have to leave. We're a negro free zone, but you're only talking about hiring. Okay. You an hour, you're sitting there and you're like, I got my blt. You didn't toast the bread. It's like socks. You just put a sock on a tomato and some, and now when I touch it, it forms in the shape of my fingers. Like a tempurpedic mattress. You can't fucking toe spread. And then some black guys like I fucking, when they do that, who has a sandwich that's not toasted? And by the way, the giant sucked this year and you feel the same way about toast, the same way about the giants.

Speaker 1:          02:10:40       And you go, Oh, uh, yeah, I'm going to deny myself this interesting conversation because you're a negro. But you're, you're being rational though. Like you're talking about rational deny themselves money that, that they don't deny things that are gonna make them money and people are selfish, don't deny themselves. Cool, interesting friends. I think there's plenty of people today amongst us that are very racist. What is racist? Racist is prejudging someone based on the color of their skin or their ethnic origin. So they, the guy likes all this stuff you like, but you refuse to see them as an exception to the ones you like. Because if you're looking at him and at the bar, well that's that one guy and your scenario. Yeah. Well I, you know you, you're painting some very simplistic scenarios that deal with a really complex issue. People prejudging people and people not liking people or people identify with other people that look like them.

Speaker 1:          02:11:34       Like you and me being too white guys. Okay. The racist you're describing doesn't like black people. I'm bringing up a scenario where if he sees a black person say there is a racism, it's like this thin veneer, oily, slick in the bathtub. When you have brill cream and you take a bath, all you got to do to go through it, it just go. So the second that black guy says, I hate the giants this year, that guy's racism just goes. I mean I have so much more prejudice for people wear flip flops for men who have those utility backpacks when they wear a suit. What about man, stay at home dads, man buns. I don't think I could be your facility backpacks and then wear a suit. Father's suit on put their backpack is all mountain climb marine with an ergonomic things and it bothers you.

Speaker 1:          02:12:16       It drives me nuts. Why does that bother? You should have a briefcase if you have a suit. But what do you mountain climbing and to do, you're a tax audit. But what is that? I mean they want to have their laptop and all their books and they want to carry it and it's easy to carry things in your bag. So find a canvas backpack if you must. But what's the matter with Karen and I don't even like when people have rolling luggage, we all are growing luggage. She can't carry 20 pounds. You Pussy rolling luggage. It's easy to roll. Yeah. So is wearing your pj's on the plane. It's disgusting to do. But this is, is this acceptable? This backpack? Yeah. That's great because you have a tee shirt on. Okay, so your, your backpack is actually more a fancy mall than your clothing. That's fine.

Speaker 1:          02:12:57       I might not, I'm not measuring and matching up correctly. You're matching up just fine. But if a young Jamie with his, uh, it tech slash comedians outfit, if he was wearing that and he had maybe like a certain type of backpack, what, what would he be allowed? What's he got? Oh, that seems, that's nice. Perfect. My problem with you, Jamie, you shouldn't have anything on your tee shirt after 30 but that's a fighter and the kid promoted my friends. That's, I'm like, okay, I'm doing a commercial. My friends, this is my friend John Dudley's. Okay, you're doing an ad, but people like loans on your shirt when you're 40 or no one cares what bands

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       you like at that age. Wow. Anyway, my general point is we all have our little quirks. You general point is you're very specific in what you allow people to do and not do. Very rigid. A Guy, we were in Jamaica on vacation and it was all you can eat thing. And he, he had his plate and he just, he must've been Irish. He piled on three huge spoonfuls of mashed potatoes. It took up most of his plate. And I'm looking at him going, we're in fucking Jamaica, the jerk chicken, all this fancy shit and you're using up your whole meal on mashed potatoes, you, that bothers me, the mic. And I hated him for the rest of the trip. I think I needed someone to hate on the trip. So I would see him. He'd just be like eating an ice cream cone. And I just go, fuck.

Speaker 2:          02:14:13       Wow. Maybe you do you recognize that's your own personal issue? It's a Scottish thing. Same as the news. We were at war for 800 years with the English and they're constantly looking at the ones who don't like confrontation or extinct. Uh, so Dr drew says this, he goes, the reason that Scott's are drunks is they like, they like conflict. So they'll put a war in their body. So they were going out. Those walking is hard. I'm giving myself a handicap, so we liked struggle. We like pain. That's fascinating. Even in fucking, I'm never totally enjoying it. I'm always like, I got to last longer. Think of Kevin Spacey. Do the alphabet backwards. What do you think of what, when do you think of Kevin Space Still? Dude, it's you think of kindness. You're going to call me tomorrow. I'll go. Thank you so much. My wife can't walk to that.

Speaker 2:          02:15:00       You Imagine Kevin Spacey's head floating over the bed. Not like dismembered and bleeding, just like his face doing nothing. Just staring. Just staring at you two and a half minutes. Do you imagine him as Kaiser San Jose or as Frank Underwood? I don't. I'm not. I don't have strong feelings about it. I'm like, I've never seen that. A house of lies show her cards. The card show. Okay, sounds great. Show. I don't know why I'm in a season three right now. Oh, just started off like you were seeing it in it. No, no, no, no. Intuit. I talked to a guy who was gay and he goes, I'm with Kevin Spacey. And I go, can you tell him banging them that I use him and all my friends do? And he's like, no, I'm not saying that. That's really mean. And I had never occurred to me that, yeah, you don't want to be known as the guy who can make you not come.

Speaker 2:          02:15:42       Yeah. Nobody wants that. But anyway, even fucking, I'm stressed out. Even when trump won, we had a big party, we were all wearing Hawaiian shirts. And when I saw Donald Trump president on the big screen in the bar, everyone started cheering. My Buddy Alan was just pouring beer on his head and I went, yeah, cause I didn't want to bomb other guys out, but my brain hadn't processed it yet and I couldn't thoroughly enjoy it. And then everyone picked me up and they're carrying me around the bar. Yeah. Do you have any problems with him being the president? You, cause you, you, you seem pretty, pretty aware and pretty rational other than the way you make people dress and wear backpacks. But did you have any problems with him being president? Is there anything disturbs you about it or are you totally open? Like if he starts fucking with the First Amendment, I'm going to drag him out of there by his heels. I'm not excited about this son in law getting a job. That sounds like nepotism

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       to me. What a coincidence. Your son in law is the most qualified person for the job. Uh, there's times when the tweets can be petty. I don't know why we're talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger's a ratings. Um, and then, no, I'm not excited about the travel budget, although he is doing a lot of shit. But as far as what we've come out with and, and the amount of fucking left wing back, uh, back patting that we've been going through for the past eight years, I'm fucking ecstatic. What's the backpacking that you're talking about? Like they were so wonderful and Obama's so great and you know, you, you come to La and you realize that everyone in this fucking city thinks Obama did an awesome job. And they also think that Bill Maher is Christopher hitchens. Like he's an intellectual Demi God in this town. Bill Maher's. Yeah. Every time I talked to someone they go, Oh, you should talk to go.

Speaker 1:          02:17:18       I'd love to see you in a room with Bill Maher. I'm like, that's your intellectual heavyweight. That's your main guy. I think he would probably agree with you on a lot of things, which really be confusing to them because he agreed with Milo on a lot of things. So a lot of people are mad at him because of that. And you know, he said that he removed Milo, reminded him of a young Christopher hitchens except you know, gay and foppish and he said a bunch of other things about him. Yeah. But he's like, you know, he just got abandoned some of what you're doing because some of what he's doing is fighting the good fight against irrational feminism that denies the biological differences between men and women and lies about the gender wage gap and all these different things that he does accurately point out which people it all the fucking time and drives me nuts.

Speaker 1:          02:18:01       I've talked about a way too many times in the show, but that God damn gender gap was in the Guardian yesterday. I know, and when Obama said it, I go, do you know that you're full of shit? Oh no, that's not true. You know you have researchers. Did you ask him or are you knowingly repeating this myth? Because most people don't get votes. Most people don't know. It's smart people that I know who have not looked into it or haven't had debates about it with other people don't understand what the gender pay gap really is. That it's simply a matter of working less hours and choosing different jobs. It's not two people. One man, one woman working side by side doing the same job with a woman makes significantly less. And that's what we're being led to believe and that is, that is a real sticking point with feminism.

Speaker 1:          02:18:40       They're being dishonest in their portrayal of the issues of the workplace and you end up going, you guys are making me think woman are dumb, so I don't like that woman's March. I go, you guys are, I don't know what you're out to. Prove here that your pussy has teeth, uh, you're making women look dumb. Even the abortion thing, half 50% of women are pro life. So why are you making this a gender issue? It's an, it's an ethics thing. It's like a euthanasia, but it does nothing to do with men or woman. Are you okay with abortion up to a certain age? No, not at all. So week after conception when it's a bundle of cells, the size of your fingernail, uh, no. Do not kill that. Wow. No heartbeat. Just uh, of, of viable cluster. A little gals, beautiful little three cells sitting there. You can suck it out with one of those tiny

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       cocktail straws you don't really drink out of, but they don't do they, they stuck it out and they want you to splat against the plexiglass walls ripped down the side. Turns out it's good for your skin. If we can get down to the morning after pills and that kind of stuff, I would love to debate to go there. But right now it's, it's way too far down the line. And you know what, speaking of Bill Maher, he doesn't have kids. Angela Merkel doesn't have kids. There's this lack of connection that these childless people have in our media and in our political system. And there's an anti kid culture going on that is f no masochism combined with laziness. And it really is our death now in many ways. Like when I'm in Williamsburg with my fucking stupid dog that I would happily kill right now and will kill your dog, feel nothing for them.

Speaker 2:          02:20:12       It's my daughter's dog and it's a little Havanese puppy. I don't fucking know. It's a poppy. You would kill the puppy. Well, if it, you know, one of the kids, I could take a meat cleaver to its head and I would be on the phone as I did it. Like we'd be like preparing a chicken for dinner. I feel no Jesus. Um, and when I have that dog, all these spinsters, oh, what's his name? Is it in boy and girl and my, who fucking cares? He's not going to wear a dress. But when you're with your kid, when I'm with my kids, my son, my youngest, my four year old is so cute. He's a freak. Like it's, he's the elephant man of cuteness. He doesn't, he looks away from people because they freak out. It's, he's Garish. She's so cute. Uh, but they see them with disdain.

Speaker 2:          02:20:48       And I've noticed that not just in hipster Williamsburg, but you know, at Fox News, I would get that from people who didn't have kids. Are you sitting at Fox News and you're looking around the table and you're like, we're sitting here talking about family values and the future of America and I'm the only person in this entire panel with kids and I can't help but think that Angela Merkel suicidal policy of bringing the refugees and fuck the whole country is somehow lik linked to her. Childlessness it may be, it's certainly linked to her desire to not come off as racist or homophobic or, excuse me, Islamophobic. Yeah, it's definitely like their life is parties and dinner parties. You don't want things to be weird, but when you have, when you have skin in the game, you go, I don't fucking care if you hate me. I gotta make sure that things are kosher for the boys, like Dana, Dana Lash, she was a feminist raver with big fucking Ginkgo genes in college and chain wallet.

Speaker 2:          02:21:40       And then she saw what a feminism was doing to young boys and making them ashamed of being men. And she had boys. She went, Whoa, whoa. We created a monster here and pivoted and became all about saying, masculinity is aok. Fuck these feminists. We were wrong. You know, weird times, man. It's really weird times where people try and define themselves now just fucking breed. I was talking to some asshole at the bar last night and he's repeating what he saw and in all of her stone movie, and I'm like, that movie's been debunked, Michael. Malice, no, sorry, Michael Moynahan the one about a World War II and how Stalin was under, you know, under appreciated. And we have to understand that we shouldn't have gone into World War II and we shouldn't have fucked with the, I don't know what move is, is you're talking about the a untold history of the world.

Speaker 2:          02:22:27       I'm watching that right now. It's read Michael Moynihan's take down of it. God Damn it. I'll just sit for stone is a sale and really good apologist. Well he was, he made out stolen to be a fucking monster in it. Oh, I thought he didn't, he didn't do enough. I thought down came out real nice. Really? Yeah. Did you watch the same thing I saw? Did you watch it? Yes. Wow. Long ago. When did it come out? Four years ago. Longer than that thing. But a long ass time ago. But I was really interested in, but they talking about in all of us don't have to respond to Moynihan's take. Oh, okay. Well I'll have to read those. To what, what is his name? Patrick point hand. Michael Mine the one hand. Who's Patrick Moynihan? What do I know that name? I forget, but I know that name too.

Speaker 2:          02:23:09       But, uh, I'm listening to this fuck face, this 34 year old and he's, he's with this, we've been with this woman for five years and she's 29. And I just said to him, just stop repeating a documentary you saw last night and go fucking propose you pussy. Did you not know him before those? This is, I was shit. I was shit faced. My wife and I had, well my, and I left the kids in the and Malibu and we came to, uh, we went out, partied and got a hotel room, got laid. It was awesome. Nice single again. I don't know how these childless people are not fucking 24 hours a day. They probably are. That's, but they don't want that to end. They don't want the fun part to end. I want to be wrapped up together and then contemplating divorce. If you're out there right now and you're in a relationship with a girl, you guys live together.

Speaker 2:          02:23:53       I don't know why she's allowed to wear clothes in the house the second she walks into the front door nude, we'll draw the blinds. She should be nude at all times. Don't you kind of want them to wear clothes so you can take the clothes off? Nope. If I was sick, if I didn't have kids, my wife would be, there'd be a basket by the front door for clothes that she has to take off when she comes in. You make her, Huh? Yeah. Noodle lady rules. High heels. Only getting a, or just thinking about it. Leather underwear. I would wear leather pants and an oversized baseball cap. He comes out about a fluff, flat brim, Guitar Player, Plastic Guitar. Now how about a Ukulele? Ukulele too. And clench shoes, clown shoes. Those, those need to come back. Actually, you know what's a hot outfit for Amanda were in bed is a white t shirt and black socks and you're just like, I'm such an ugly pig man.

Speaker 2:          02:24:39       Spaghetti stains on it. Just like such a dad, a big gut hanging out of the bottom of the t shirt. I was like, my buddy Dan goes, he goes smelling a woman's ass as a poor man's Viagara cause you're grossed out by how much you like it and you're like, I'm a fucking pig. And then boy, you know, young, young, young man, poor man shot by yourself. You're like, that's hilarious. Like this. Ooh, what the fuck? You're sticking your nose in it while you're eating her out from behind. Joey Diaz calls that doing the pigeon piggish and on that note, should we wrap this up? Yeah, let's wrap it up. All Right Gavin. Thank you man. It was fun. Always fun to you. Yeah. Appreciate

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       times and tell everybody where they can see your show and listen to it and watch it. My show is it compound media.com I also do a video series on the rebel.media and I have a regular written column, a story coming out tomorrow about milo@tackymagtakitackymag.com and a compound media is all Anthony Kumina stuff because that is correct. So he changed the name because of that stupid bitch. That's why you had to change. And rallies. He's fucking damaged goods now. I don't know. It was still going on. I thought it was over. It is, but comedians are such pussies these days that they don't want to fuck up their future. You know, hanging out with Kevin can wait show. Ah, and on that note, uh, we'll be back tomorrow with former UFC bantamweight champion Dominick Cruz. See Ya. Bye.

Speaker 4:          02:26:26       Okay.
