Speaker 1:          00:03:48       We sell all of the best shit that we can find that helps physical performance helps proper proper performance. What's wrong with my fucking mouth today? Yesterday too. Something about a little something about being up in Canada for too long. They got me those fucks. Um, we, we, we find everything that can weather it can help cognitive performance, whether it can help your endurance. Anything that we find that's great for as far as strength and conditioning equipment, we try to sell it at on it, including our kettle bell series. My favorite exercise as far as strength and conditioning without a doubt is kettle bells. I think they're incredibly versatile. There's so many different exercises you can do with them. And uh, we sell a wide variety of sizes and weights. We have weights that go, we have a bunch of different packages. If you go to the kettle bell section, you could see the men's beginner kettlebell section, which has a 20, a 16 and a 12 kilobytes kilobytes, kilogram key low.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       That's how they say it in those other countries that use the metric system. But we're like over here in America, we're like, no, no, no, we're gonna stick with pounds and inches. Some stupid shit that doesn't make any sense while the rest of the world use kilos. When you go over to Canada, they have kilometers on the mile and you just look at the, you're going, I'm like, we're not going a hundred miles an hour. No, we're going a hundred kilometers. Well, what the fuck is that? Oh, it's 50 Celsius today. What are you even saying? What does that mean? It's not 50 degrees outside. No, no, no. 50 Celsius. Take a liter of gas. Yeah, liter of gas. But the fuck is that. This is nonsense. Um, bunch of packages including the, uh, advanced kettlebell package, which has a 20, at 24 and at 28. Um, and all the way up to, it's a pretty heavy ones too.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       We have a 40 kilogram, which is I think 90 pounds. That's 40, 90 pounds, something like that. It's like 2.2 pounds per kilogram. Let's find out what that is. 40 kilograms. 40 kilos. I'd say it's 90, 96. Is it 96 times 2.2? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, do you know that right? Because you live in Japan, in Japan, these kilograms, right? Yeah. What the fuck is wrong with America? I don't know, man. Why? Why don't you know they tried that shit when I was a kid. I remember when I was a kid, there was, there was a, um, a whole push to get everybody to you use the metric system. 88, 88. That's what it is. Okay. 88, 88.184, nine pounds is 40 kilograms. Um, essentially pretty close to 90 pounds. Um, so we have basically, if you can work out with those killer, if you could work out with two 40 pound or two 40 kilo kettlebells, you're a fucking monster.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       I mean, that's like a heavyweight would work out with two 40 pound kilos and 40 pounds. What the fuck is wrong with me? 40 Kilo kettlebells and get an awesome workout. I've got to talk like a moron. I can't free ball this early in the morning. It just doesn't work. Um, we also sell battle ropes, weight vests. Basically anything that you'd need for a comprehensive strength and conditioning program. You never need to go to a gym again. You could buy all your shit on it. If you do do it though, please. If you can't find someone who's a personal trainer that can guide you and show you the correct form and technique for exercises, please start light. Take it slow and look at a video online and try to do it with a very lightweight and get the form down. First form is one of the most important things when it comes to any strength and conditioning program that involves weights.

Speaker 1:          00:07:23       You can do it and do it healthily and do it safely and work out and get in great shape. But if you do a goofy, you will fucking hurt yourself. If you throw it around big heavy iron cannonballs with handles on them, it's very possible you're going to fuck yourself up. So don't be a macho meathead like me and start off slow. Start off light and learn the proper form. Um, if you want a good workout DVD to follow, we have an excellent one. It's, it's Keith. I'm Keith Weber's extreme kettlebell cardio workout series. They're fantastic. I use them all the time. Um, they're like one of my best as far as like getting a good workout in 20 minutes. You can get, if you use Keith Weber series, you can get a workout that will give you a fucking heart attack with a 45 pound kettle bell and you could do it in a half an hour and I'm not kidding.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       It will break you down even if you were in really good shape. He has a two excellent ones, extreme kettle bell to a cardio workout DVD and one and we have a ton of other ones that are available at on it including fitness function, a Kettlebell DVD. We have ones for women, the Bell Babe Kettlebell DVD with Donica Storino. I would change the name of that Bell Bay please. Seriously, she has pink kettle bells to what a cutie. Um, and anyway, all that information is available as well as a lot of inspirational stuff add on it.com.

He provides us with a lot of a diet and nutrition advice and uh, as well as advice on some of the foods that we sound like the earth grown nutrients or the hemp force protein powder.

All Right, ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, ensign. Anyways here, why fuck around play the music

Speaker 2:          00:09:59       Rogan experience my day. Joe Rogan podcast all day, way, way, way, way back in. I think it was

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       1998 I first got to meet ensign when you aren't barred. Nice. Seven. They said, wow, you onboard Royce Alger and Royce Alger was the one of the latest and greatest of the wrestlers. It was entering into the UFC and they were going to take the place like mark, there was a Mark Coleman era when Mark Coleman was smashing everybody and it was 255 pounds solid muscle. Kevin Jackson beat John Lewis then to yeah, put that thing closer to your face that we can pay. You can move it around a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Kevin Jackson beat John Lewis. We had like, there was like some serious wrestlers back in that day that we're just starting. Like Kenny Monday was entering into MMA. Did he do, did he do extreme combat or [inaudible] and then he did, um, one of the member they had, um, the same people. They data submission only thing. We're frank shamrock took on Dan Henderson and I'm going to heal ankle lock.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       You remember that? Yeah. There was a lot of that going on, man. It was a lot. All these, uh, these high level wrestlers were just starting to find their way into MMA. They're like, oh, this is finally an opportunity to, uh, to use a wrestling skills and try to tell him. I saw though wrestlers fight always, always said it. They don't understand numbers. It's true. Yeah. You had a wicked one man. You're one of the few guys to ever submit Randy couture. You submitted Randy coture with an arm bar and before you caught him with that arm bar, man, you've landed some of the most devastating kicks from the butt scoot position I've ever seen. Because everybody used to just throw straight kicks to kick guys off from the butts goop. But you figured out a way to Torque your hips from the ground you would land.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       It's a little late kick. Yeah. And the nasty leg kick from the ground. It's kind of interesting because you don't see that from other dudes. And even to this day, that's a rare, you don't, I think that fight your fight with Randy coture might've been like the most effective application of those low leg kicks on the ground I've ever seen. Yeah. So you all just wanted to, my whole objective in that fight was just to keep pressing forward. Just pressure him all the way. Yeah, that was a, there it is right there. That was a great fight, man. That was a great fight. That was a really interesting fight, man. You are a wild motherfucker dude. You're one of my all time favorite fighters to watch because of that. And your, uh, your style of fighting man was always, you know, balls to the wall, do or die and die.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       You know a lot of people talk that, but you did it. You did it in every single fight, man. And you for without a doubt, you have one of the most exciting mixed martial arts careers ever. And despite your, you know, your wild, crazy style, you've got through it, you're fine man. You all those years of fighting and you know, can not stuttering too much. Not at all, man. How did you manage to pull that off? Make him all short and fast, man. Yeah, this is, yeah, this was the, the butts goop thing. You were doing something totally different because you, you snuck up on him like he scooted forward. Randy was standing right in front of you but you were blasting them with these like kid, you know, my ankles and my shins. I had like a whole roll of like, Oh yeah, you, you really taped it up.

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       Hard, hard to let it, let us do it. So I was like, why not like castle my legs? Oh the men when they used to let everybody fight with wrestling shoes on, that was a big thing too. They used to kick guys in the face with wrestling shoes, which I thought maybe okay with the top of the wrestling shoe, but if you do shit like wheel kicks and like sidekicks to the face, you could scratch the fuck out of someone's I like with the bottom, the texture rubber part of the shoe. Know that's a, that's a weird thing. When they were the transitionary time of MMA when they were four sort of first sorting out the rules. But this was a big fight because this is, Randy had left the UFC and a Randy was one of the elite guys in the UFC. This is after he had beat v Tour and CPV.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       Yeah. And Randy was known as like one of the best guys in the world, but all slapped on that armbar son and that's it. And an anyway is a motherfucker. Ladies and gentlemen, are you a still training guys now over in Japan? Um, more doing stuff up north there, up north and my bracelets that said, yeah, popping in the gym here and there, but you're still working with the people near the nuclear plant as you do. It's still doing that. Going up to the temporary housing, what is that situation like up there for everybody here? You know, you hear a lot of hysteria and you hear everyone's kind of scared because they're afraid the radiation is getting into the water and it's coming over to America. What I've read from scientists that have actually been off the coast of Fukushima who have, uh, analyze the fish is that it's not something to worry about yet. They've caught fish

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       directly off the coast that live there, that are like not migrating fish and they say those fissures safe to eat. It depends on where, where he's talking with you talking with the power plant. Um, as of right now, there's not much of a worry, but it all depends on what's going to happen like that because they're getting too much radioactive waste storage. You can't store it anymore. Yeah, yeah. They're doing this crazy thing when they have a pit and they're surrounding the pit with frozen rods, so they're going to freeze the ground and turn this pit into this like temporary housing for all this radioactive water. When they're getting too much, they can't, they can't supply it anymore. They got these big bins of their, I'm holding a minute. They're cracking though. So yes. As far as up by the plant, it's a lot of radiation.

Speaker 3:          00:15:37       But as far as, um, the people who were displaced from the tsunami or from the radiation there, Darren, like a hopeless situation because they're, they have temporary housing, which is the box is smaller than this room and they have to live there with their families in the true, the winter. It's like just a small wall that you can, you can hear the rain hit the roofs. Yeah. Wow. So it's a, that has been extended. It was supposed to be a two year thing. They extended it for another three. So that's five and they're still not going to be able to move on from then. The government is not helping them. So why isn't the government helping him? I don't think they can afford it. Yeah. Right now, why isn't the world helping? I mean that's a world issue. That's a, I feel like any sort of a cataclysmic disaster like that, that is a time where the world has to show a world community, forget about all the borders and nations and all the nonsense.

Speaker 3:          00:16:26       If there's money that can be donated, if this people that can be helped, that's a time to help. I mean that's a real cluster fuck of a situation do. Yeah. I've been up there a 29 times. Yeah. Wow. That's amazing. Still going to continue you. It's um, it's kind of shocking how quick that whole thing went bad. Like everybody thought that when you see nuclear power plants, you u s assume they have some sort of a backup plan. Like if it goes bad, I didn't know until this, this event, that power plants, you can't shut them down. Like I didn't know that either. Isn't that crazy? Like what do you mean? You have to keep them operating? Like what are you talking about? Like you have to keep them going to keep them cool. And if you don't, they burn through the containment and they, you know, they melt the meltdown and go into the earth and they don't know what the fuck happened.

Speaker 3:          00:17:15       But then Fukushima was just, uh, just the, the size of the earthquake and then the timing of the tsunami coming in so fast and so hard. Yeah. But it's weird that that's also one of the things that they do with nuclear power plants, that they put them near the ocean to keep them cool so they could use the water, but it's just like, oh, what the fuck? Really? Yeah. I learned a lot about nuclear power plants from that, from just paying attention to it because before that I, I didn't even know what they did. I thought like the nuclear energy somehow or another made electricity, but it's really just make steam. Yeah, I know that either. Yeah. Yeah. Like that's still like some old school method of, you know, using steam power to create electricity and you just say, just do it through as it clears out a lot of them all over the world.

Speaker 3:          00:18:01       Asking a scarier, when you have an easy job to San Diego down the coast, you see them and you're like, oh Jesus, that's a fucking nuclear power plant right there. That fucker could go bad to, all they have to do is get hit with the wrong natural disasters. I think the one in Fukushima though needed to be updated. Right. It was like an old system, like they didn't have the the right amount of backup and redundancy as far as the generators and stuff. The headline of all reports on it prior to it and didn't do anything of Bartlett. So now it's a situation where the government just doesn't have enough money to fix everything.

Speaker 4:          00:18:34       Yeah, there's too much. Uh, see, the thing is is that they have a 2020 kilometer radius. Now that is a exclusive zone where people can go in and out because of the radiation. But in actuality it's supposed to be 30 because when I went in there with my guy or Connor, I fall in hot spots higher than ones 10 kilometers from the plant and 30 kilometers one day said they can't, they won't do that because they can't displace that much more people. They can't afford it. And I'm like, I'm like, so you got to let people live in radiation. It's kind of crazy sometimes weird birth defects with like rabbits and shit are born with no ears, which is, yeah. Which is to a human is going to happen in the next one, eight, seven, eight years. Right. You see about 10 years and before you start releasing the fix to it.

Speaker 3:          00:19:21       Oh Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It's a real wake up call for people and you know, it's, there's not a whole lot of options as far as like how to generate power. Nuclear power when you get to large cities is one of the most effective way to generate power. Yeah. Like people are protesting to shut them down, man. What's going to happen if you shut them down? Yeah, well I think there's a way that they, if they have like a plan to shut them down, there's a way to maintain it. I'm talking completely out of my ass by the way, but from what I've read, it's, they can do it much better than if it just shuts down because of a natural disaster and they can't plan for it, which is the situation that they're in now. You know what's crazy is la, because it's never rainy here, but there's no solar.

Speaker 3:          00:20:04       Anything like you talk about like not using a resource. Every fucking building in la should be covered in solar panels. They should get all of their electricity from the sucks big business I guess. Huh? It should. Someone should bring that in because it's all over Hawaii. I'm doing it at my house and I have a, my neighbor doesn't have electrical bills anymore. He, everything he gets is from the sun. Yeah. His, no electricity doesn't pay for electricity at all. These like some maintenance and like the, apparently the batteries lose a certain amount of effectiveness every year. I have very slight amount and over a course of like 10 years, it could be like, you know, come a certain percentage and then it becomes noticeable. But then you just replace the batteries. My house in Hawaii we got like, I think 70% of the roof is covered with really?

Speaker 3:          00:20:47       Yeah, cos it a lot. But I heard it brings on your electric bill. Yeah. Big Time. Yeah. Well in Hawaii you could also collect rainwater to, and who know, I know a lot of people that do that. I knew a dude who lived up in, um, he lived up on Mauna Loa and he had a whole system set up. Like you just lived up there. He had a solar electricity, he had a rain water that they collected in a bin because it rains up there. He was in the, the, this is, if you've been to the big island, the big island you, I'm sure you've had. But for folks who haven't, the big island has like a bunch of different ecosystems. It's like desert, like arid, dry climate. And then you go to another place, it's like near Hilo is like a God damn rain forest.

Speaker 3:          00:21:27       It's crazy. It's like a Polynesian tropical rain forest and that's where this dude lived. And he collected rainwater up there and that's how he got all of his water and all electricity just for mother earth girls on food and his garden. Crazy. Just lived up there. You know, you're, um, the island itself, it's like one of the most magical places on earth, you know. I mean, all the Hawaiian islands are pretty God damn magical, but, but the big island itself, it's just incredible. That's active volcano. Yes. Constantly getting bigger. Give a fly over. You do the helicopter tour. Um, no, I never did that. I went and saw the at the observatory though. Oh, the, yeah, the the, the way. Uh, yeah, the um, um, the helicopter tours pretty dope because you get to see the lava actually pouring into the ocean. Oh really? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:22:17       You see the big island Grotzia hitting bigger. Yeah. You can see a grill. It's wild. It's just all steam. Like you can see the red lava going into the ocean and then you see the steam coming off and you literally watching the island grow. Oh Wow. Yeah, it's pretty intense. It's pretty cool. And also on the big island, they have all these areas where you could see like photos of houses that were lost when the lava came down and just wiped out certain towns that were just a little freaky thing that you, you have a house and you see the love of coming out about what? Like a mile per hour. Not even though and you just can't do nothing about it. Nothing. There's nothing you can do to stop it. Nothing but just watching. I mean the think the big dig a big hole debts or pour water on it.

Speaker 3:          00:23:02       It was just hard in it. Now there's nothing you can do and it just, cause it's slowly, well it's amazing is, it's so beautiful there. People don't give a shit. They're like, so what? We'll rebuild. But that's still better than living on the mainland. When you lived in Hawaii, did you get a, did you get island fever? What do you mean? When I was away, I missed it. No island fever, like living there. Were you like, it's too small. Like you feel like you've got to get never did. Now I love the ocean. That's why so a lot of diving, a lot of surfing and I was good. I, I missed it whenever I went away though. Isn't your brothers like some crazy free diving champion? Ryan, we can hold this [inaudible] seven minutes. He's a surfer now. How long can he hold his breath for? I don't know. He used to go on deep. Does this

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       go into deep blue? That was beyond, that was after my time. We used to just free dive night dive, but that thing about going down a hundred feet and that kind of stuff is crazy. Yeah. He had a ridiculous ability to hold a breath. Yeah. Yeah. If a lot of people don't know your brother was a badass mixed martial arts fighter to this. A lot of stuff. Man. Paul Champion, whatever he does, he does good. Yeah. Racquetball Chap who, um, Shih Tzu did him in May. He was going to go into dentistry. He, he had his massage license. Wow. He was a pharmacist. Pharmaceutical Rep for Merck. Wow. What's he doing now? He's doing a bootcamp. No. Oh, like a bootcamp training. I think he'd take everyday man. He's up at five in the morning teaching classes. Wow. And why? Yeah. And uh, which uh, Honolulu in Honolulu right near it.

Speaker 4:          00:24:39       Right in town or I didn't tell him. So he has a, he, I think he has three or four locations now and the, the most crowded class have is 5:00 AM 5:00 AM what people would want to get fit before they go to work I guess. Yeah. Oh fuck man. You know, if you get used to doing that. I've been doing that over the last couple of months. I get up in the morning and first thing I'd do is work out. I'd never used to do that. I used to eat breakfast and lay around, but now I force myself to workout first thing in the morning. It makes a whole day a different experience. He gets out of the way to get that in there. How much you trained in these days? Not much. When I go there, I try to do bootcamp. Um, I met, I met, sure. Kiya and all them one, I was doing bracelets like 12 hours a day.

Speaker 4:          00:25:20       So I don't want to go to boot Kevin and get a little tired in the day and have to be working. These bracelets that you, or one that you're wearing right now, these are, you sent me some and I gave them to my daughters. They love him. Right. Um, what, what is the significance behind these bracelets? Well, in Japan they believed that the bracelets protect you. Yeah. So if a brace it breaks, it's actually a good thing because it's taking something that was supposed to come to you. And that's the real main reason why I started wearing them and was interested in him. And later on down the line someone told me, Oh, you know, they're, you know that there's parcels, there are real gems. And I'm like, what do you mean there's crystals? I know Crystal's, okay, cool. But what did you mean whether gems?

Speaker 4:          00:26:00       And they told me, you know what the r next to have the citrine and it's all different properties for different things. And I'm like, really? And it's crazy because, um, you know, there's, there's one for every ailment, there's one for depression, there's one for diabetes, you know, and, and for me, I, I made, I make the braces. I'm not a stone expert. Right. And I love the bracelets tonight. When I started making them for color, I realized I was choosing different stones. And then we started reading up on that. And now it's like sometimes you get people coming in to make a bracelet for arthritis. And I'm the one making the braces, but I'm not a stone expert and I'm not this glue that's pushing power stones. I'm pushing bracelets and it just happens to be parcels. And so they want to line up for

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       arthritis. So I get all my, you know, a little book and Ocu arthritis stones. Okay. Calcite. I line up the calcite, get a good look at and something nice and something that's for their ailment. And two days later, and this happened numerous times, they'll walk in and see, you know, my hands aren't tight when I wake up in the morning. Do you believe that though? Yes. See the thing is I'm supposed to be like, well, I'm supposed to be like, yeah, I know, but then for me, it's still new to me, so I'm like, no way. Really. I'm super skeptical at this 0.5 because I've just seen so much bullshit, but I think that if you tell someone that a a, a rock can help some part of their life, then it actually can. Yeah. The placebo effect is real and I don't understand it, but you can give people sugar pills and tell them that it's medicine and their body thinking that it's medicine starts to relax and concentrate on here, Huh.

Speaker 3:          00:27:37       Yeah. A lot of it is just people were, I think there's a lot of ailments that fall upon people because of stress and because they're imbalanced and they can be somewhat alleviated by placebos. We just don't understand how the mind works. What, what frequency are you tuning into when you're taking in a placebo that you think is medicine that allows you to get better? We don't know. We have no idea, but we do know that it's a real fat. Yeah, it does. Yeah. It's pretty cool, Huh? So that's probably what it is. I don't think that a rock can cure diabetes, but what the fuck do I know? I don't know. You know the works and then it might be that placebo thing. Yeah, it's gotta be whatever it is, man. It's working. I think. What do you remember when everybody was wearing those Hologram risk bracelets?

Speaker 3:          00:28:21       Those rubber ones, like a lot of athletes are wearing them. Balanced ones. Yeah, they got sued for like a hundred million bucks and it's all bullshit. It's 100% bullshit. But I swear to God, people were telling me that it worked. Like, like real athletes like Shane Carwyn, Shane Carlton was telling me, he's like, dude, I'm telling you I put this thing on and it changed my life and I was like, it's up to Siebel must via 100% it's 100% but placebo somehow it's real. It's like there's this dude that I know who's a chiropractor who does it shit called zone healing and it's a weird shit. Like they're like they press down and certain parts of your back and claims it can help. The digestion and help all sorts of areas of your body. But when you press him about it, like how's this stuff work? How's it work?

Speaker 3:          00:29:07       It's essentially he's providing you have an avenue for the placebo effect to work. Like by telling you that this is helping you in certain areas, it actually can help people in certain areas. So you've got to believe it. Yeah. But if you're smart enough, you know it's bullshit and then you can't believe it. So you're robbed of the placebo effect by being too smart. Yeah, it's fucked. It's weird. Right? It's almost like you can be too smart for your own good. Yeah. Something that, that situation is not good to be two sworn though. In that situation, what is like, like I had a conversation with

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       someone once and when it came to religion and fighting and they were like, why do so many fights at why so many fighters religious? And I said, well, it's probably the same reason why so many like people at war religious, you know, there's an old expression, there's no atheists in a foxhole. It's like when you need to believe in something, a lot of times people fall on religion and that it can help like this. People that have a real true belief in God and that true belief in God does benefit them substantially. It's real that what the effect of that belief is real and it doesn't necessarily mean that what they believe in is real, but the fact that they believe in it and they give themselves to it can actually benefit them. So it becomes real. Yeah, it does. No, it does. Yeah. I've seen people like that where you know it's God's will and they accept things easier because of that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:36       Yeah, it's actually beneficial for a lot of people. It's very beneficial and in a sense sometimes being an atheist or being someone who doubts everything can kind of fuck you because I've always said that like I wished that someone could come along with a cult that I truly believed in. Like something has a really good, really well, like I just not think about all this shit. You guys got it all explained out. Oh right, good. And just d, Let me look at it a little bit. All right. It seems like you've got your bases covered now. I don't have to think about these things. Well this is what is, uh, being a atheist can screw you. You know, it's being too religious can also too, yeah. Well it's, especially if you're too religious in like a hypocritical sort of a way, which is a lot of times people, they pick and choose what they believe and when it comes to religion, you know, this is a lot of Christians that are like angry people and they know the angry about people that are non Christians, are angry about people that don't follow aspects of the Bible that they believe in and it gets, uh, it gets kind of squirrely.

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       But the near the nature of it, I think all, I think the nature of all religions, the best aspects of all religions and aren't tainted by man are the lessons that people learn over a life of trial and error and wisdom and sharing ideas. And he kind of learned that to be a good person you have to do good things. And to be a happy person, you have to help others. And you know when you treat each other like they're your brothers and sisters out there in the world, you truly have a better life and you live in a, in a way that makes you more connected and it makes you in their eyes more connected to God. And in a big sense that's what you're doing with your life these days. All your work helping all these people in Fukushima, like you're not a guy who just kind of like does charity because it's a public thing and it makes you look good. Like you feel very dedicated to these causes and it's very admirable because you go out there and you risk your health and safety. You go to the, I've seen the photos that you put up online, man, you are in the fucking hot zone.

Speaker 4:          00:32:45       Yeah, we went up to three times. Yeah. What is that like? I probably say like this, right? It doesn't feel like raising nothing. You can't feel nothing. You don't get hot, you don't feel itchy. There's nothing man. The radiation's a scary thing man. And all you see is the guy you're or growing up on the couch

Speaker 4:          00:33:06       just scares you just so watching that thing go up. Yeah. How, what is like a normal radiation level? Um, well, well when I went into Shima the most high God and the one time was a 25,000 microsieverts so as far as if you to to put into relation 65,000 microsieverts within a year we'll change your blood chemistry. Whoa. Yeah. So I got 25,000. I think I got a little more after that, but nothing, I kind of stopped at about halfway. So he says he safe. They say that you're supposed to take iodine, iodine tablets. What does I die on? Tavis helps to, um, contracted, but it's mostly for the Tyro, thyroid cancer, which is one of the most common cancers. Oh, so it just works on a tie. Well, yeah. And there's all kinds of stuff they said we eat, see lead, you know, seaweeds go see we strong and I are done. I asked to see lead helps with the radiation.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       What if you get seaweed that's contaminated with radiation? One of mine. Got It. You're fucked. Yeah. Yeah. They said that they've, they've started catching tuna that show a 3% increase in radiation and everybody started freaking out. But they say that that's still negligible still there.

Speaker 4:          00:34:17       No. The thing that I always wonder know is since cause she was, everyone's been testing everything though. I don't, have they been doing that before? Have you caught before she, their car like tuna and tested for radiation? I don't think they've done that. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:34:30       I think they probably must have otherwise he wouldn't have a base level.

Speaker 4:          00:34:33       Oh, I can pay this. The grace. Oh, I see. I see.

Speaker 1:          00:34:37       I read a thing recently about grand central station in New York City is radioactive because it's made out of granite and granite is, it has natural radioactive properties. So in actuality, when you walk them through Grand Central Station is more radioactive than is required, uh, for a nuclear power plant to be below, like nuclear power plants have, like when you're working at a power plant, it has to be below a certain amount of radiation. Grand Central Station is higher than that just because of natural granite.

Speaker 4:          00:35:06       It's fucking crazy. That's the people to understand. There's radiation all over. Yeah. Like once on antifreeze Shayma when the winds were blowing the right direction from me, I got 16. Microsieverts I fall, I fall on the plane, went round trip to um, New York. I got 19. I had the same guard kroner. So it's like you write in their plane, you're getting, you're getting a mediation to the CMN outside going to the car and radiation bouncing off the concrete and you get radiation. You're getting reation we're getting reached right now from, I'm freaking out. Computers.

Speaker 3:          00:35:39       Yeah. Well that's what they say about cell phones. Right? Like that they're going to see a bunch of people that have brain tumors later on because they're holding phones up to their ears all the time. So it's something that's really misunderstood right now. The plane thing is a big one. Yeah, please. That's why I think it's higher risk yet. It'd be a flight attendant. A lot of flight attendants can work too long. Yeah. Yeah. It's, um, it's like getting, apparently a round trip flight is like getting a bunch of x rays. Yeah. Chest x rays. We talked about it before. I tried to figure out what the actual number was, but when you get an x ray, when you go to the dentist, that chick hits that button from behind a fucking concrete blast barrier. You know, they cover, you would lead and then they run out of the room and hit that button and then come back in. But meanwhile you're getting that same kind of exposure every time you get on a flight. Fly to London, fly as you can. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But flight attendants, I don't hear about them getting sick all the time. Well, my friend had a flight. It didn't told me there's a lot of them think of cancer.

Speaker 3:          00:36:40       What kind of cancer? I Dunno. Yeah. I wonder if there's some, like if the iodine thing protects you from thyroid cancer, if there's other shit that protects you from other cancers, it probably is, but we don't know about it yet. It's probably antioxidants, green, leafy vegetables, things like that. I mean, isn't that, but I don't truly totally understand the process of evolution, but from what I understand, a lot of it is from random mutations that are caused by radiation. Like yeah. Random mutations that prove to be advantageous. Those are the ones that are capped, you know, she's just getting off a plane. Oh, maybe that's why I'm so stupid today. That's why I can't talk so good. Yeah, there's certain days you wonder. Yeah. Um, but rocks granted like a lot of different things just give off natural radiation. Yeah. What are they going to do?

Speaker 3:          00:37:30       Um, to, to try to contain that area there? They have a long term. No, there's a, um, I have a friend that she went to a tech sheet trying to, he has a machine that will actually melt down radiation off glass, out of water. And it's in the testing stage right now, almost in a final testing seats. So if that getting that kind of get accepted, it's going to be a big thing. It can melt down Riyadh. The heat goes so high that it can melt down militate though. Off Water. Off Glass. Whoa. Yeah, it's so it's takes glass that's radioactive and it melted down. But where's the radiation go? And he goes, yeah, I know. I don't need to have this conversation. Even the, even like the problem is she wants to like the call Shit. Oh yeah. He said they have tons of that and that it can melt that down and then it turns it into like dry wall so he could actually use the cow shit is radioactive. Yeah. This is great. As it cost you, they have tons of and didn't know what to do with it. It's the fine radioactive cow shit that you could turn it into dry wall. Wow. People are weird. What a weird world

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       we live in. Yeah. I know. There was some kid who, um, I had figured out some sort of a way to take radioactive waste and to reprocess it and turn it into fuel again. Wow. Yeah. Because most radioactive waste, you know, they have to store it in the ground. Like there's places in Nevada where they have these, did you see Godzilla? The new Godzilla? No, I didn't. It is. Okay. It's kind of stupid. But what one of the things is the monsters go after the radioactive waste that's stored in near Las Vegas. Like way out deep in the desert. Apparently they have these, these vaults where they, they take radioactive waste from nuclear power plants and they bury it deep into the ground. The monsters went after that cause they eat radiation. Oh Wow. Pretty fucking it. Yeah. But this kid who is invented this, uh, this process believes that in the future that they'll be able to take all of this radioactive quote unquote waste and that it's not waste.

Speaker 1:          00:39:31       It's just that they don't completely understand the process of converting it back to fuel yet. But once that process is understood, there will be no radioactive waste anymore. There'll be able to convert that back to fuel. Wow. Yeah. Pretty interesting. Right? Yeah. Crazy shit going on that. Well that's an interesting thing about when we fuck up because when human beings fucked up, we fucked up so many different things. But when we fuck up, our backs get pushed against the wall and then we're forced to innovate like a, there's a 19 year old kid and figured out a machine that can take the plastic out of that Pacific garbage patch. You know about that garbage patch? It's in the ocean, you know about all of that? No. Oh that's a crazy thing. There's an area in the ocean, enormous area, this bigger than the size of Texas that is all plastic from the world, from all over the countries of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       People that have littered things that have fallen off of boats, things that have got picked up from the beach. And they've all swirled, cause you know, there's um, there's currents in the ocean and his currents create pass and inside, yeah. Inside these paths in these areas where all this stuff has sort of congealed and congested, um, that those aren't the right words. But it's formed this like floating patch of garbage and it's really fucked up because it's in the Wa there's, there's an image of it, but they've, um, they've done all these missions to go out and try to figure out how big exactly is. The problem is a lot of it is suspended underneath the water and it's being broken down slowly by the water. So fish are eating it, ingesting it, and getting sick. Birds are taking the plastic back and feeding it to their children, to their babies because the birds don't understand what the fuck it is.

Speaker 1:          00:41:11       So they, there's islands that they find where these birds, these baby birds are dead and their stomachs are filled with plastic bits that their mothers have given them because their mothers don't know what the fuck they are. Their mothers think that it's fish or food or something like that. Wow. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. So this kid has figured out a way to take this gigantic, see this machine, it's skims the, uh, the, the ocean and it's going to suck all the plastic out of the ocean and cleaned the whole thing. Whoa. Yeah. Incredible. Your kid. Yeah. And then they've also said, well, you know, hey, you know, we're going to all these problems with the ocean and the, there's these dead zones is lack of oxygen and pollution in the ocean. They figured out a way to throw iron to take iron scrap and poured into the ocean and that iron scrap, we'll create algae and create, uh, different, uh, environments for fish to live in.

Speaker 1:          00:42:02       And it'll re oxygenate the water while yes, it's weird like when people get their back pushed up again, the, on both of those, I don't even, I shouldn't even be allowed to talk about it too fucking stupid to explain it correctly, but it's, it's fascinating. There's this kid event, this a giant ocean garbage patch skimmer and that's this machine that he's, he's invented and I believe he's only 19 too, but in, within a few years time, he did a Ted talk on it. Within a few years time they're going to be able to clean up that patch if this invention, uh, pants out. Yeah. That's the weird thing about people. We fuck everything up, but when we fuck everything up, someone smarter comes along, goes, okay. Okay. Okay. That's amazing. That's amazing. That's amazing. Well, we were doing right and a lot of labor. Wasn't that like us, man, you still primitive days, man.

Speaker 1:          00:42:49       Cave man days yet. Well, I'm glad there's people like us too though. You know? That's the Yin and the Yang, right? That's the great, the great balance of life can all be eggheads. There has to be all sorts of different people to make this world so interesting. But yeah, if it was just up to you and me, I don't think there'd be an internet. We wouldn't really be having a podcast. We wouldn't be taught through the fuck knows how this works. How's this microphone work? I have no clue. I rely on these. I have no idea how they were true. I don't have a clue. I couldn't even draw you a fucking like a crude schematic of what's inside of a microphone, you know? But it's important. Yeah, the knee. That's the beauty of being human is that we all sort of contribute in one sort of a way.

Speaker 1:          00:43:32       We're all like one piece of a gigantic organism that's kind of doing all these things and occasionally part of the organism fucks up like, ah, we didn't have a backup on a power plant shit. And then the world has to sort of scramble and right now I'm sure there's people far more intelligent than you or I, and they're trying to figure out a way to fix things like Fukushima. Yeah, I bet there's a lot of them. We got to, yeah, that thing that they're doing with the w the ice is pretty crazy. These giant pipes in the ground and they're trying to freeze the ground to turn it into a giant containment wall, like a big pot, like a big pool. Huge swimming pool filled with radioactive waste in real fucked. I mean, isn't there a better way to do it? It sounds so ridiculous. It sounds like something a little Kibin advent, you know, but I don't think there is. What is the government of Japan? Did they have a financial problem right now? I don't know man. But they're not, you're

Speaker 4:          00:44:31       just not reimbursing the people. They're not helping the people. You know, like if you, if you're going to take a land and a house away from a family who's, who's worked hard for it to work for it all their lives, because a company that's run by the government, which is Tepco, the, the nuclear plant is run by the government. If you're, your client is going to fuck up, you're going to take responsibility and relocate them to an equal amount of things that they had. Instead of putting them in a little box, how much money would that cost? How many Neil? 100,000 of them. So that's why they can afford it. Over a hundred.

Speaker 3:          00:45:10       100,000 and you'd have to spend at least a hundred thousand probably on each one of them do. Yeah. Well a lot of them were helped out by Red Cross. Oh yeah. Yeah. So I don't think government's doing, yeah. Fuck. Well, you figured the government didn't tell the people what was really happening with the radiation? Well, that was one of the few times I think that I can recall where I talked to, you know, Japanese people are very orderly and very polite. It's a very different society. When I was in Japan, what was fascinating because it was only about a year after the Fukushima incident and I was talking to this guy and uh, he was very reluctant to talk negatively about the government, but he was trying to hedge his words and basically said was, I don't think they've been entirely honest. That was like, that's the worst he could have said yes.

Speaker 3:          00:46:02       He didn't want to say like different, the Japanese culture, like for Americans who are, everybody in America wants a pill to lose weight. You know, they want a quick fix for everything. I don't think they totally understand the Japanese culture. That's why like a doc. Did you see the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi? No. It's fascinating, fascinating documentary. It's about this guy who has a small Sushi place in a Tokyo subway and this small Sushi place he's been working at for decades and he works 16 hours a day, every day and we'll work like for years and years, just develop this one dish and has all these apprentices and that this one apprentice, they thought I was working for years on this particular egg dish. And then finally he got it right and the guy said, you got it right finally. And the guy was crying cause it some fucking egg dish.

Speaker 3:          00:46:53       Whoa. Some egg dishes. It's, this is a, that's Jiro. It's an interesting documentary. Apparently has the best Sushi in uh, in Japan is incredible. The delicious Sushi and it's like a 10 seat restaurant. Really? Yeah. Yeah. And before the documentary came out, it was booked for months in advance. But now that documentaries out who knows me, it might be impossible to get in there earlier, but because of the fact that he keeps the place so small and he doesn't have that many people working for him, like he, his, he's not really concerned with branching out like you've used an American, they were like, we're going to sell our brand, our businesses, our brand. And what we're

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       going to do now is going to spread out of the malls all across America. Jiro dreams of Sushi stores. Nope, this cat has one place and he's humble. He's hardworking. He's fucking 80 years old. He had a quit smoking cigarettes cause he had a heart attack, but you know, healed back up, stop smoking cigarettes, jumped right back in. Still working 16 hours a day. Wow, that's neat. And I should check that out. It's, it's admirable. Right. But isn't that, that's the Sushi place. Tiny little place man. But isn't that sort of indicative about the differences between Japanese culture and Americans? A lot of differences. Yeah. Extreme differences in the way of thinking in the way of doing things. Yeah. Well, that's where you, you know, you are known for not just being, uh, one of the pioneers of MMA, but you're known for that expression Yamato [inaudible] that you have always, you've always promoted that ideal, this, this Samurai spirit and this, this spirit of Japan, this way of, of doing things wholeheartedly. And you know, you've talked openly that you freely give yourself, like when you would go to fight and you'd be ready to die. Yes. And not just saying that like you, you would really reconciled it in your mind. You would say goodbye to your friends. Say Goodbye to your family

Speaker 4:          00:48:53       letters. I wrote letters to people that I wanted to say goodbye to every fight. Yeah. That's some deep shit. You know, it was the thing too is I'm fighting to die flying to die. You're going to train with the will to die too, so you can measure them as good training I got in. Yeah. I mean, I'm training every day before the fight, so I won't die in the fight. I'm planning, I'm okay. I'm accepting the fact that I might die there, but I know that the better I can be is the less chance to me dying in the ring. So you know, I'm not going to get up in the morning and because I'm sore I'm not going to miss training because I'm tired or I'm lazy because it'll might be the difference in me living and dying in the room. So you know, it helped me out a lot. And then the training aspect and you know the dining, I mean I want to eat, I want to drink a coke, but I'm trying to eat only good things on my before my fight. And it's, it's a lot easier to do that when you're in to that level. It can't hurt you, you know, to plan to die in the ring to, to believe that and to train and to walk that life for that three months while training for the fight it, they can't hurt you.

Speaker 1:          00:50:07       Is it difficult for you because you earnestly embraced that thought process? Is it difficult for you when you see guys that are kind of dabbling in MMA, that kind of like half asking it, not training hard enough. Maybe they have some talent, but they don't really put their will and heart into it. Well, it's a whole new era now because

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       back in the day we didn't get paid good. We weren't, we weren't, weren't that worried about, you know, losing a sponsor here, right. Being cut by the UFC, you know, that kind of stuff didn't because there was all these little association with fighting for so little bit money. The objective and the whole movement of that error was different. Yeah. So you know, when fighters start getting lazy or they don't fight as hard or the tap out a little sooner, you know, I understand that because it's a whole new era because you're fighting for a different reason though. They're fighting for money, they're fighting for living, they're fighting for sponsors if wanting to look good. You know? So it's easier when you're fighting for those reasons. I mean there's only so much money will make you do, but if you're fighting for your honor and you're fighting for your life, it's a whole different level. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:51:17       it's interesting too because in this day and age it's a real business as well. So it's almost like you have to have a little bit of both to be the elite of the elite, you almost have to have the attitude that you had, but in order to be, to maximize your profits, you have to kind of think about it in a different way. And after like avoid certain fights or pick and choose your opponents, but then once you have an opponent locked in, it's almost like the best of both worlds seems to be like the answer. Well I think, yeah, you have to have a good

Speaker 4:          00:51:47       balance here because if you just look a fighter like me wouldn't make it today. I mean I probably wouldn't have that much wins. I probably would have three with losses in a role and I'd probably be losing way. My job at the UFC, you know, there's, it's, it's when people ask me a lot, you know, are you disappointed at the, wait, what happened to the fight game? And they, they, you know, I always say, you know, a lot of times now in the fight game where the worrier we'll start is where the fight ends now. I mean, right where his heart is going to kick in right now. Okay. This is

Speaker 3:          00:52:21       wanna see if this guy has it in his heart or not. That's when the ref stops the fight because it's getting dangerous, you know? Did you see, um, this past weekend's fights? Yeah, I did. Did you see Jason High and Rafael dos Anjos yeah. Did you, what'd you think about that, that situation? Do you know what happened? He pushed the right, that should never happen. Never happened. It should never happen. If you don't know what happened. Um, Dosantos cracked Jason High, hit him with a real good shot, had them down. I thought it was a premature stoppage. He was, he was getting hit, but he was, he was moving into position, but Dosantos did that thing that guys do where they look at the referee, the hitting them, and then they look at the referee there aren't you gonna stop that and then the referee comes in and stops that, which is kind of fucking manipulative that guys do that all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:53:03       This was hard about the refereeing job is split second can change a good stop. It's too shitty softening. And if he stopped at like a second earlier when I'd read Jason High got dropped and it was kind of a little bit out of it. After the flurry, it would have been a good stoppage. But he waited and Jason, I actually got his posture and I started like coming up again. It was a little premature. But do you think that it's better to be premature than it is to be, to have guys take too many shots? Like what are you thoughts on that in the day today? Today's MMA? Yes, definitely. Today's I'm going to stop the fights her. Yeah. You got to kind of let the guys getting hurt. But the MMA of your era pride was such a completely different animal because there was stomps and soccer kicks and there was, the rule system was completely different.

Speaker 3:          00:53:51       It was just a completely different kind of finds. Any pins and you're fighting for you right now in the UFC. It's a sport, it's a sport, it's a, it's a huge sport now you can get sponsored, you can make a living with it. It's huge. You're fighting for a sport and to, to be a huge sport as you need immediate need to sponsors. You can't have guys getting hurt. You can't make it too brutal, you know? So in this day and age you should be more cautious than anything in stopping the face. I grew with that. But back in the day when you're fighting for honor, no, I mean if that fight was not televised and you don't need to worry about sponsors and you know, and people getting hurt and suits and everything, I would, if I, in my day I would prefer the fight not to have stoppages.

Speaker 3:          00:54:34       Well, like perfect example in my opinion is Frankie Edgar and like Frankie Edgar and gray Maynard lot of referees would've stopped to have those fights in the first round. A lot of referees. But Frankie Edgar came back to uh, to have a draw and one of those fights where it looked like gray Maynard had him. Yeah, he was solid. I mean, it was ridiculous. A lot of people would have stopped that fight and waved it off. But Frankie Edgar came back to win the second round and then start winning enough, you know, rounds and make it close enough. So that was a draw. And then the second fight or the fight after that same thing, he gets tagged and hurt real bad and the first round and then came back to knock gray Maynard out later in the fight. It's, it's hard. It's, it's uh, in everybody's different. Some guys can take a shot, some guys just can't, some guys get hurt and they never come back.

Speaker 3:          00:55:22       Some guys are known for coming back. The thing I think about that is, you know, if the stuff is just weren't so soon, you know how many unbelievable inspirational moments we'd have in fighting. But that's a sacrifice we make four for it to be such a big sport. No. Yeah, the butt part. It's a big, big part. Yeah. It's a weird thing because there's no absolute correct moment in a fight to call a fight. Like one person's call, like the guys had a punishment. Another referee may disagree. It's so subjective. Yeah. Ice. It's a real hard thing. If I'm like, you know, it's, I mean, I wouldn't say I could be the same fighter if I fought today. Now when you say that, like when you say that you would have three losses in a row, like what would be the difference between the way you fought and the way like say, modern MMA fighters fight? I'm, for me, the win isn't getting my hand raised. Yeah. The wind is hitting the fears that I have head on and growing as a person.

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       If I, it's, it's really, sometimes it really contracts each other because for Igor, Volvo Chante, when I fought him, the best thing for me to do was to take him down and get on top. But the best thing for me to, to grow as a man, as a person is to hit that fearful stage of throwing total total it, Igor. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       Ego Of, of [inaudible] for folks who don't know, when you were finding him was one of the most devastating strikers in the sport at the time. He was brutal knockout artists and he was a small guy, but he fucked up Mark Kerr when Mark Carr was big, he remember he caught Mark Harwood Harwell bomb standing up and me ego was only like five, 10 right. It wasn't a, yeah, he looked like a guy that should have probably been way bigger and longer, but someone like chopped his arms off at the end, not for fists, like in the middle of his, and he was just this ball of muscle and bone. That guy could crack.

Speaker 4:          00:57:24       Yeah. For me to win the fight and to win the battle in my heart to be a stronger person. It's two different things.

Speaker 1:          00:57:32       So the, when the fight is was to use your Jujitsu to take him to the ground just a minute, but to overcome your fear was to bite down your mouthpiece and just wing. Yes and fuck. Did you ever man, that was some crazy shit. I remember I was watching it at my house with Eddie Bravo and we were just screaming. The whole like beginning of that fight was oh shit. Oh Shit. Cause you just did exactly what, like a coil, like a Greg Jackson would tell you not to do. They would say, they would say, okay, I want you to avoid, avoid his punches, which is what we're going to do. We're going to kick the legs, we're going to move around a lot. When you see the opening, we see the punches calm. You're going to shoot him for the take down when they are bit down that mouthpiece and you were, that was one of the wildest opening exchanges I can remember from the day. You know what

Speaker 4:          00:58:20       cirrhotic thing about that fight is? It was my worst beating that ever took, but it was the best fight for me. I've learned so much about myself in that fight. I learned about my heart and that actually solidified that, you know, living the Yarmouth, Llama wait, you know, a lot of people, you know, you can say it, you can have these kind of sorta hard fights, but that fight kind of showed that I'm actually living it. So it was the worst beating physically Vic as far as getting the results as far as the victory, that was probably the worst fight in my career. But as far as me growing as a person and as far as, you know, something that was a reputation that was to me forever, it was the best fight.

Speaker 1:          00:59:04       Do you have a fight that like you look, you look back and your member is like a proud moment or one of your proudest moments?

Speaker 4:          00:59:11       Oh, that fight would probably be it, but not at the moment. Yeah, because at the moment I didn't think I was that bad. I, uh, at the moment when, um, when I was getting hit, the biggest, I remember getting hit some shots that really rocked me and I, I remember thinking in my head, the thing that I thought was, I can't let them know it hurt. And I remember looking at my corner and looking at them and just saying, I'm okay. It didn't ask me, but I just did it on purpose because I knew he'd be see me doing nearly, what the fuck's wrong with this guy. Just hit him so hard. What, what blue they'll just knock people out with and he skies look in his corner so I'm okay. And then you know that that's the kind of stuff. And I, when the, when the fight was stopped and I was screaming, no, it wasn't because I was trying to be tough.

Speaker 4:          00:59:55       I just just felt in that moment and time I felt, okay, I got two minutes between Rollins, why are you coming in at 30 seconds and seeing the fights over. And the second thing I'm thinking too is you guys don't know the training that I went through for this. This is nothing compared to what I did every day. I said, I mean, I felt like, let me go on. And I also felt that this is the time right here. This is the time, my breaking moment in. This is a time where I can show myself that I can still go on. But I didn't realize that, you know, my, my, my year was preferred. It's so bad that I had my equilibrium was off on my, didn't realize that I needed, you know, I was saying, I was saying the doctor, no, I still got two minutes, you know, I'm thinking about two minutes.

Speaker 4:          01:00:38       Don't check me now, but I actually should have been yelling. I give me three months. I didn't realize how bad it was. Yeah. Wow. So how long did it take for you to recover? Three months to recover from that. Wow. So I had a periphery to your drum. Um, I had a broken jaw, broken finger, and I had a swollen brain and the, that, that was a big worry for the doctors. Doug, the other big brewer was a kidney. The kidney levels rose 2000 times a normal person. The kidney levels. Do you see what he, what the doctor explained to me was when your muscles get any type of trauma, even if it's just one area of your body, your muscles all act together as a team and they'll pull it off toxins that will affect your kidneys apparently.

Speaker 1:          01:01:26       So the, the breakdown of the muscle tissue was processed by the kidneys and the kidneys had a deal with a lot of tissues. Sins, yeah. Tissue Trauma. And so it was a lot of types of, something of what the kidney levels, if they go too high, the kidneys are shut down. Well, it's also probably the effort that you put forth to cause it was such a crazy, crazy fight. You know, that, that issue that a lot of crossfitters have that rhabdomyolysis. You hear about that? No, it's a big issue that's going on with a, a lot of these crossfit competitions, they push themselves so far, they push themselves to the brink of your total body failure. And this rhabdomyolysis is very common amongst crossfitters. I know a guy whose wife got it, uh, from just training crossfit because they push themselves so fucking hard that they have like kidney failure, their body starts breaking down. It's really common. I mean, anytime when someone overtrained that's a,

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       it's a, it's a big issue. So a fight at post fight like a fight like that and especially pull up, uh, Ego Volv changin versus Francisco Bueno. Yeah, I saw that. Z. See what this guy was like back in the day of the fight that actually got me intrigued to fight Igor. Yeah. When I saw that, that, that, that devastation was like something like, well, can you manage stepping in that zone, knowing that that could happen to you at any moment. But standing there in that zone, fighting that, you know, this is when I fought marker was right after he beat up Google Dorothy. Ah, you know, so I was looking at fights to grow as a person, not to get a win win loss record. You know, that's why I'm saying Encino of today wouldn't make it right because it wasn't looking, it wasn't very good from a career.

Speaker 3:          01:03:09       You fought some big fucking guys too, and you weren't like, like you fought Randy who's a heavyweight, you know, and like, here's a here's ego of, of channeling versus Francisco [inaudible]. And this was Igor at his prime. Who has guys built, look at this. Ding, Ding, Ding. He caught him three times as he out on the way down. Yeah, that was, he was out for a long time too. Oh yeah, dude. He got flatlined. We're sitting, I was sitting ringside and there was this, I guess a girl, his girlfriend. But she was going crazy screaming man, like she was. He didn't wake up for a while, but that was a brutal, brutal, brutal Kayo. And that was Igor at his very best. And look at this again. Look at the way this guy's belt. I mean, he really does look like a guy who is way bigger.

Speaker 3:          01:03:52       Cause I had to cut off the ends of his body. Look at us clink. And he had those crazy punches to those casting punches he threw. He was one of the first guys to throw like a, the way fate Dar was known for throwing those punches where it's almost like your, your hand is a perpendicular with the ground instead of a horizontal with it. They would throw, he would throw a lot of his punches like this in a very unorthodox way of casting punches. Those are the days, the glory days. When you look back, man, and you thankfully, you know from the 1997 your fright with Royce Alger. Did they have gloves on back then? That was the last CFC that they gave us an option. So I opted to not have gloves because they always, always want to have to try that. Yeah. Wow. So that was the, you were one in the last UFC where you didn't have to work a lot with gene was the last one that they made it an option. Why is it that it was a rule that you have? So I, I feel like I just made it. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:04:47       Well for a grappler too, you know, that's a big advantage. So sneaky and chokes and the way they tape the, they didn't allow you to tape the hands and they taped it for me and it was like it cut. Like here is like just, just pretty much the risk. So nothing on this at all to protect your hand, Huh? Yeah. What do you think now about these new, like there's a lot of issues these days with guys I pokes, but it wasn't a big issue back then, which is weird to me that there was

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       not nearly as much of an issue in those early days. Like you didn't see a lot of I pokes. Yeah. You know, and you, you didn't see a lot in pride and I, Tim Kennedy was on the podcast. We have these pride gloves. There was a bunch of them like the last year of Sia. Oh, there's a lot of them a lot lately. But these pride gloves, Tim Kennedy believes are superior to the UFC gloves because they naturally promote a curved fist. Whereas the UFC gloves have much more of a straight line to them. Everlast has a new glove that they're using with the Bella tour. And, um, it's a much more curved fist and it's also, there's more panning across the top to, uh, to reinforce the, the metacarpals when you, when you're hitting. And they apparently stopped a lot of bone breaks because that all really, but I almost feel like the same thing I feel like with football that like everybody is concerned about head trauma and football, but no one wants to look at, there's a lot of people who have a now analyzed football.

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       They say, well, there's the best way to stop his head. Trauma is probably to make people play football with no helmets. Because if you play football with no helmets, you're gonna play it totally different. You cannot go head to head in, clash into each other if you have no fucking element. And the only real way to control the way these guys do this is to make it so that it's impossible to you. I mean, they're spiking each other with helmets on and shoulder pads and shit. They're saying if you really want to do it, look at rugby and look at Australian rules. Football, less had trauma, less instances of a traumatic brain injury and they're there fighting with no pads. I mean that's probably, and I think that might be the way to do with MMA to man, because I get that people think that it's brutal to punch people with no gloves on.

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       But guess what? You're kicking people with nothing on your feet. Your foot is way fucking stronger. You're, he'll never gets hurt. I mean, you could, he'll kick someone in the face all day and it's never going to hurt you or heal. I mean, I've seen people, we'll kick people full clip, slamming of their face. They walk off fine. You never see them like, ow my foot, you know, it doesn't hurt your foot, your heel, you can stomp on the ground. You know, you can do things with your foot. You could never do with your hands. I think they should probably go bare knuckle. I think that might be the way the gloves are actually just to protect the hens ivy. Yeah. Yeah. And maybe stop some cuts. Elbows, elbows, cows. So it's probably, we could have an elbow here. What do you think about that? Because some people think that elbows actually stop a lot of good fights because it cuts. Asking a guy who didn't, I didn't want, I wanted growing shots allowed. Right. I mean everything and even I ecology, you know, I really don't because I believe that the, see all the people that get hurt in the eyes because you can't do it so you're not expecting it. If we were professionals, I mean your, your to to stop

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       all the joint locks, all the different chokes. Who'd your training to, to stop being in bad positions. If you, if, if you're allowed to have growing shots, you'd be, you, you train not to get hit in the groin. I think if you got to allow our gouges you've got a real problem. Yeah. I mean this, I mean even, you know, biting his only thing that I would be for you, but biting is good if you get side control and bites him and then he would actually change a flight. You know what else? Oh, biting the ear. Yeah. I mean, look how Holly feel reacted to Mike Tyson. A chunk of his ear off. Yeah. I think I gouges or that's a dangerous problem. You've got a bunch of guys like Alan Belcher's careers in jeopardy because of detached retinas. Michael Bisping had to have several eyes surgery. He's got a real problem now.

Speaker 3:          01:08:58       One of his eyes looked weird, like he's got the thumbing air. My accident. Yeah. I'm talking about grappling. When you try and dice, it's hard if the guy's going to defend from that. You know nick, how Yuki losses. I was, because I believe a big, a big thing was you, you're allowing these dirty fighters to get away with it because it's not in the rules. Right. So he's not expecting it. Yeah. Right. So I figured a professional expecting it would would, that would not have happened if Nikai knew that it was in the rules. Hmm. Yeah. That was, he fought Gerard Gardot. Yeah. That was big. Yeah. Big Karate Guide. That was shameful. Yeah. That was shameful. It was, yeah. He lost his eye because of that. Yeah. He's one of the few, but there's quite a few guys have had a text. Right. And I was like, yeah, that's really common these days, man.

Speaker 3:          01:09:44       Really common. I just, I don't know what they could do about it. I almost feel like there's a way to cover the tips of the fingers though. I wonder. Yeah, I wonder how much it will affect the Groppe Linville yeah. I wonder if it's a small, like a thin piece of like a, a thin leather that it may be even enhance the grappling because it'll give you more grip and when your hands are sweaty, you know when you clamp down, like maybe someone's working on it right now probably. Huh? I'm sure there is. These are the Bella tore gloves you could see up on that thing. See the bell toward glove is on the left. Where's the UFC style glove is on the right and the bell tower glove has a a more padding on the metacarpal and it's curved more. Uh Huh. I don't know what they, what they have shown though.

Speaker 3:          01:10:25       Belterra has had far less handbrakes because of that. Oh really? Yeah. But then again, it goes back to the football thing, like maybe you're better off knowing that you can't just tee off on someone's head without breaking your hand. I mean, if guys had to be more conservative with their punches, maybe we would see more kicks. Maybe we'd see more grappling and maybe MMA would be more realistic. And that's true, man. That's true. I don't know. I don't know what the answer is. Yeah, I tickets. We have a bunch of issues in MMA right now. The judging issues. A tremendous man. What's going on with that man? You see the Diego Sanchez, Ross Pearson, five crazy fucking ridiculous. Crazy ridiculous. I haven't seen one person that thought Diego Sanchez won that fight, other than Diego Diego's family know. And I love Diego. I'd think, you know, it's not Diego's fault that they scored it wrong, but God damn, that was a bad decision.

Speaker 3:          01:11:16       It was very bad. Yeah. I mean, Diego's got a lot of heart. You can't, you can't take it away from him. He's that guy. He's a Yamato Dimasi right? He is. He's a motherfucker. Diego Sanchez comes to watching the guy from one of my all time favorites. He's a wild man. Yeah. He's one of the few guys today that's still fights with complete total reckless abandon, you know, especially when he starts getting hurt. Oh yeah. It's face could be hanging up. When he fought Martin Kampmann and that third round, his face was hanging off, hanging off of his skull and he's charging like a wild beast with rabies.

Speaker 3:          01:11:54       He's a crazy dude, man. He's fun to watch fight. He's pure, pure aggression. That guy. Pure aggression and heart. I like that guy. Yeah, love watching him fight man. I just don't think he won that decision. Yeah, I don't think so either. What do you think about the way the UFC has rounds too? Cause one of the things I really loved about pride was that first 10 minute round that really separated like the people that had real, true endurance and knew how to pace yourself. There's one thing pacing yourself on a five minute round is one thing. Patient yourself on a 10 minute round as an entirely different proposition when it comes to conditioning. Yeah. Well, again, he goes to the question, you know, the reason why am amazed being changed in the way it is for the sponsors and for the, for the audience.

Speaker 3:          01:12:43       And I think it's depending on the fighter can you mentioned, you know, you have those boring fights where they get to the ground and you exist. Why don't you stand up? But they're doing enough that they don't get broken up and you're like, damn, five minutes is that that bad? But he can't imagine that happening for 10 minutes. Yeah, that's true. That's the thing. That's, I think that's the thing that really works for the, the sport now because they're shorter rounds for the audience. I agree. But there's a purist in me that I don't like stand ups. I don't think you should be stood up. Yeah. I think if the guys on the bottom and you don't like the fact that the guy's holding you down, you got to get better at getting up. You got to get better at sweeping them. You've got to get better at.

Speaker 3:          01:13:20       Uh, it's just trying to attack from the bottom, attacking to try to get a better position to stand back up or to try to finish him from your back. I just don't think it's realistic for a guy just to hang on and let the referee standing back up again. Which is a strategy. You see it all the time. Well, it's a sport. No. Yeah, yeah. If you're looking at it as a fight, you know, that's why he's a good MMA fighter. What he's, I mean like a street fighter. It's a whole different thing. Right. But even as a sport, I think if you're going to look at the sport, it's still the sport of fighting. And if a guy can hold you down, he's holding you down. Like you can't just stand them up. Like she worked hard to get that guy down and the guy on the bottom doesn't want to be there.

Speaker 3:          01:13:57       So the guy in the bottom technique. Yeah, he's just knocking his hands and just holding them. Yeah. Just to get a better position stood up again. That's what a lot of guys do. They just wait to get stood back up. I think that's kind of crazy. Yeah, it, I don't like that either. I to see a guy like, you know, you know Charles Olivera, you know that kid. I like watching that guy fight because he's so dangerous off of his back because he's, he's real aggressive standing up and one of the reasons why he's so aggressive standing up, he's not worried about being taken down because if he, he's taken down, it's tax a tax, a tax right away off of his back arm bars triangle. Like this is no picnic. Taking that guy on the ground, you take him down to the ground, you just did another different type of account is constantly attack.

Speaker 3:          01:14:37       Yeah, I like that. That's good. Yeah. When the guys have one dimensional games, that's when getting taken down becomes a problem because they get taken down and then the guy can hold them there, but you can't hold some guys, you know, there's guys that have wicked guards. You take them down and man, you're in a fucking new world, a shit. You're just running into another sort of a situation where you can get submitted or lose the fight. I think that that's the best way for MMA. The be the best way is not standing guys up because then why not even just why have it MMA then? Why not just fight kickboxing? If you just want to fight standing up then where there's no threat of takedowns, then you could do some wild shit, you know? But you have a different sport then if you're going to have takedowns.

Speaker 3:          01:15:22       I don't think you should have standups. I really don't. Yeah, true. But stem, can you imagine the sponsor's wouldn't like that TV would be baseball, man. How do they watch baseball? I way more boring. They will watch it. True. You look at that then they should not break them. That's not that boring I to look at that. It's not even close. Well, even football man. What do you think? Two on ones and stuff. I don't like that. You don't like that man? No. The team fighting shit. Oh, not the team fighting like two on one. Even two on one. I think the deal strategy man, I think two one one would be interesting if it's like a guy like you versus to non trained guys. Would that be funny? That'd be exciting. Exciting non train big guys. Yes. Non trained guys though. But with train guys.

Speaker 3:          01:16:15       No that's like a circus. But like say if you had a guy like John Jones versus to like football players that don't really know how to fight, that would be exciting. Exciting. It would, that would be exciting. But a guy like John Jones versus two John Jones's? No. Yeah, no way. I don't want to see that. I mean for me I always, I always felt that there was one of the things I wanted to try and do two on one ace fight two guys at one time and see because there's a hole in your fear live in. Yeah. Oh yeah. Fuck yeah. So there's that fear element is what I was kinda intrigued to try and experience. Would you want to fight two guys at the same size as you know, but like say if I'm, if I'm too, I'm too 30 like guys that are like 180 or 200 pounds, just have a little bit of advantage of size and then yeah, the issues would be different now.

Speaker 3:          01:17:08       Yeah. Yeah. Well that's what I'm saying. Like two untrained guys, you get like too rough, tough fucking football players, you know, they don't really know how to fight, give him like a couple of weeks to fucking hit or whatever. Just a little bit, you know, just a couple of weeks to do some fight training. But the real, the reality is a guy like you versus a football player that has no martial arts experience, he would need years just to be able to survive on his own. But two of them, they have that, you know, the gangster fights. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a, it's actually pretty semi trained. All of them are semi train and that you didn't even like gangster fights. You're talking about the Russian? No one's in Japan that the Yakuza is fine and stuff, but really they have one guy and Liza Lou. You guys are a little bit smaller and this, it's crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:17:58       Some of the fights man. So it's one guy versus two guys. One guy versus two guys. And the the, the two guys are a little bit smaller. A little bit smaller. Just a little bit. Yeah. And the Yakuza sets these up. There's a, there's a fights that are run by them. Yeah. Is it organized? Yes. Organized is, we're organized. They call it though. It's um, they call it a Chica cock. Togi Chica is underground and Cocteau gears fighting Chica. Cocteau Ogee yeah. So underground fight weight. If you're in Japan when they have one, I'll take you to fuck. Yeah, hazy. Then you know, the fun, the good thing about it is a lot of these guys don't have that much skill and they just did this a bra. Wow. Now do they have like a doctor standing by for these things or they have a ring doctors, they have referees, they have everything.

Speaker 3:          01:18:45       And you could get away with that in Japan because of the Yakuza has, it's a different sort of a scenario then like say the mafia in America. So yeah, it's a little bit different. Yeah. I guess much more accepted. Right? Yes it is. It's, it's, it's something inside of people know that's around. Wow. But it's not something that you want to be public about, Huh? Yeah. They made me cover up my tattoos. We've talked about this the last time we were on the podcast, I was in a gym and they made me put on a long sleeve shirt. You come back and you can't probably can't shower here. Yeah. Because shower my room. Um, so, but the Yakuza is just, is not talked about, but it's everywhere. It's everywhere. You can see them a wrong, there's nice guys that are, cause there's assholes. There's this, a whole bunch of, I've, I've had a lot of stuff with them.

Speaker 3:          01:19:30       Yeah. We talked about a little bit about that last time. You were here on the podcast. We had a smack the shit out of some guy. It's all in the book too. Okay. Now tell me about the book and when is it out? This is the one for you, man. Beautiful. Oh, awesome. Beautiful. Yeah, it's uh, I think four years in the making them live as a man, die as a man, become a man. And do you understand that saying yes. Do you know that? You know, do you know what I think? Well, I don't know if we talked about it before, but you know, the middle line is to die when everyone thinks that that's the end. So everyone thinks that the normal reading would be to live as a man, become a man and

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       a man. But I believe that until you faced it more, most fearful tests of dying, you don't know how strong you actually are. Hmm. So you live your life with all these little tests in life or little's trials that you have to build your strength and build your heart to the last test of the dying. And the way you die is going to determine whether you've passed that test or not. So that's why I like that title. Yeah. That's a,

Speaker 1:          01:20:37       in today's Day and age, this strange, soft pussified society that we live in. You know, and there's a lot of good things about the pussified society. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of good things about people being civil with each other and about having laws and about having, you know, being able to get your food from grocery store. All those things are good, but what's bad about all these things, and it's not bad about these things, but the, the,

Speaker 1:          01:21:03       the repercussions of them is that men don't develop character. And a lot of men fold under pressure because they've never experienced pressure. They don't know themselves. They don't know what they're capable of because they've never had to face adversity, true adversity. When you were really worried about your life, when you're really worried about your safety, when you are, your back is up against the wall and you either rise to the occasion or your dwarfed by the moment. And so many people that have never faced adversity, they just immediately fall apart. They panicked, they fold, they don't know what to do. Yeah. That's what you were fighting against.

Speaker 4:          01:21:35       Yeah. And um, the, a lot of it is in the book is a lot of the stuff that I've went through and it's not like me being a big hero and being flying with bright colors in every experience. Sometimes there's experiences where I really just fucked up and I just, and some of those fuckups you're actually really taught me about like, uh, there was, uh, the book starts off with this story about my friend that, uh, was when we were, when I was little and like 12 years old, I watched a friend get beat up by bigger guys and I didn't do anything about it. I was so scared. I was frozen, I didn't know what to do and I just watched it and I was afraid of getting involved and getting hurt, physically hurt, you know, beaten, beaten up, possibly go in the hospital, possibly a broken bone and I didn't do anything about it.

Speaker 4:          01:22:28       And Wow. The thing about that now is if I did something about it and say I got a broken arm, broken leg, they broke my by orbital, I'd be here today, probably healed up because the body heals. But to this day, even that, even if that episode was 30 something years ago, I still hurt from that insight. Thinking about that, wishing I could rewind and do something about it, wishing I could see that my friend again and tell him, I'm sorry. What'd we see my friend and telling him, man, fuck, I don't know why it didn't help you. You know? I never saw the guy again after that. The Ma. Yeah, and it was, it's something that just is even just talking about it right now, it's just it, it, I, I heard about it. I hurt, I hurt. I in my heart. I heard thinking about it.

Speaker 1:          01:23:11       Yeah. Do you think that those moments when you have these, the, these moments, those are to s to make the wrong decision and to feel the repercussions of that wrong decision? That's an integral part of the learning process because when something comes up in the future, you've experienced the pain of the wrong decision and then the right decision becomes the only decision. Yeah. That's probably the best way to learn. Yeah. Trial and error. It's the only way I think to really truly understand it. You can learn a little bit from other people's mistakes. You know, you can sort of internalized their mistakes and you put it in into your category or your or your catalog rather of knowledge. But I think to truly have a a real lesson in your head, yeah, you almost have to fuck it up yourself.

Speaker 4:          01:23:58       Well, that one experience has helped me make the right decisions and a lot of other things that came later in my life, but still that, just that one, that one just still hurts, man. 30 something years later, man.

Speaker 1:          01:24:09       Wow. Any bone that was broken would have been healed by that. Wow. That's the true thing also about losses is that everybody wants to win. Winning is everything when he's the only thing, it's not everything. It's the only thing. People always say that there are no second place, first loser, you know, but the reality is those losses and that awful feeling of those losses are so fucking important for the growing process. If you don't realize what it's like to drop your hands and get cracked by a counter shot, you don't realize how important it is to really keep your hands up. You you won't. No, you won't internalize it, but when you've been cracked and rocked and you wind up losing a fight, you're like fuck. Then when you're in that fight again or in another fight that those lessons are concrete, those lessons are tangible. Those lessons are a part of who you are now. I suppose it depends on

Speaker 4:          01:25:01       what level. Are you going to look at wins and losses at? Yeah, because if after you fight, if someone asks me after I fought, how'd you do? I mean if you're talking about the way I think, I don't know yet cause I'm going to know if I won or lost that fight in my next fight. If I become a better fighter because of that experience, I'm a better fighter. I won because I gained and I got better. So you know, losses are determined on what you're going to do after the law. Awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:25:26       Yeah. There's oftentimes wins that fuck a fighter up more than a loss does because like say maybe you catch a guy with one punch and you knock them out and then you just decide that you're a knockout puncher now instead of being 10 Finkel instead of using a comprehensive game, you just kind of a striker. All of a sudden, a lot of guys, man, a lot of guys who are Jujitsu, black belts all the sudden started getting in these kickboxing matches and getting fucked up and it was so frustrating for me to watch, like, I understand that you like to strike however you are fucking wizard on the ground and you're not even attempting. She use these skills because you had in this one thing, so they decided they were a striker. A lot of the game is the mind, right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:26:09       The book covers every fight. Exactly how I was thinking from when I got the fight to when I was preparing for the fight during the fight. It's going to be interesting because a lot of people think that I'm just the almost the dom mushy guy that has no fears and just comes out and has this iron type of thinking. But it kind of tells you exactly what I'm thinking during the fight, what happened, what I thought after the fight. And it's, it's, it's straight up real stuff. I mean,

Speaker 1:          01:26:37       well, you know, custom motto, the Guy, the long time trained Mike Tyson, famous guy who was really what his, his take wasn't just the technical aspects of boxing, but also the psychology behind boxing. And one of the things that he ingrained in Mike Tyson, he said that a coward and the hero feel the exact same thing. It's just that the hero chooses to act. Why the coward falls apart is what you'd do at fury. It's what you do with the fear. And his other thing was that fear is like fire. It can, it can cook your food for you, it can keep you warm, or if you lose control of it, it can burn your house down and kill you. Yeah. Yeah. That's so real. Yeah. Yeah. It's like it's your, your impressive performances are more impressive knowing that you were scared knowing that you had all the fears that everybody else has, but you decided anyway to still clamped down your mouthpiece and, and fucking throw led at equal vote. Shanshan yeah, that's, that's what I was fighting for this Yamanto Dimasi and you know, eastern eastern philosophy, which is very different in a lot of ways than western philosophy. The philosophy that a lot of people associate with martial arts, the respect and honor, integrity and warrior spirit. A lot of that is kind of missing in some, some MMA camps. And it's almost like they become jocks and athletes and not, not as much martial artists.

Speaker 4:          01:28:07       What do you think about that? I think it's, uh, it's something that's people are losing. It is true that there's a benefit in having that right. Well, indefinitely. Because what happens when you run your gym and you fight in that mentality, you're, once you done with Emma, you can't fight forever. Right? And when you're done with it, it, it'll carry you. It'll carry on with you as a person. If you're just being a jock and doing just Emon man, you're just doing that. Once you're done with that, you're going to, you're going to go into the real world, the person that you were when you started fighting.

Speaker 1:          01:28:42       Not only that, you'll probably be one of those motherfuckers to those boring ass glory day stories. They keep talking about that Glenn. Yeah. Back when you won the Olympic trials for wrestling and you know, it was doing great until I blew that disk. You know,

Speaker 4:          01:28:56       if you train with that honor and discipline and you develop that during your fighting career, you're going to definitely be a better man when you finish your fighting career.

Speaker 1:          01:29:04       Well, I got real lucky when I first started, uh, doing martial arts is that my, my taekwondo instructor was very into the, the, the aspects of martial arts that we consider like the philosophy and the mindset and the warrior code, indomitable spirit, like all these different things was we're promoted very heavily and promoted that. One of the big ones was that martial arts or just a ve, a vehicle for developing your human potential and that this is even when you can't kick and even when you can't punch and even when your body's old, you're still doing martial arts because this, this, this path that you are on this path of, of learning this path of testing yourself and this path of trying to overcome resistance. This will stay with you forever in life.

Speaker 4:          01:29:53       Yeah. Well, yeah, I believe martial arts for me was a steer in my life, uh, stared at, I had to climb to become a better person.

Speaker 1:          01:30:01       Do you think that it would, I think it would stop a lot of bullying if martial arts were mandatory in school.

Speaker 4:          01:30:07       Yeah, I think so. Yeah. It would, it would stop a lot of them crazy. You know, being tough fights in the school. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:14       Yeah. Test. If guys could test each other and guys could test themselves and guys can push themselves like in the gym and also just develop confidence because you actually know how to fight instead of like pretending you know how to find, try to scare people off because you're insecure, which is what the bottom have those though. No matter what. Less of it though, don't you think you'd have less of it? Yeah, for sure. I mean, you have bullies in the gym. There's always going to be problems with guys in the gym. Beat up on lesser talented guys, hurt guys when they're sparring and supposed to be going 50% and they go 100% you're always going to have that goes to have gym wars or one guy elevates a little bit and the young guy catches up to him and then the other guy takes it to another level and next thing you know they're in a full on fight. Yeah. Yeah. When you were training for, um, for MMA fights, how did you structure your training? Like when you, when you said about like say if you have, if you were about to fight mark her for example, and you have eight weeks to prepare for your fight, how did you structure your training camp? Did you do it all yourself? Did you have someone help you design your programs?

Speaker 4:          01:31:16       Um, I did a lot, um, work with Egan. Egan would help me out with a strategy. We'd helped me with a game plan and then we'd set our, or our training in correspondence to the game plan. Yeah, like mark curve for me. I didn't think I could get strong and big enough to match and powerful par. So I thought no getting stamina and moving faster. So I think I was like 94 kilos in that fight. Yeah. What does 94 kilos? 94 kilos, I don't know. Let's find out two or tools to a seven to eight maybe. Let's see how many pounds is 94 kilos? It is two oh seven two seven was like two 62

Speaker 3:          01:32:01       65 town muscle. Yeah, he was fucking gigantic. And he was saying that he was going to throw total toy at me, so I was working my striking when I actually went to, um, more Reese's Jim Murray Smith. Oh really? And worked there with him. How did that fight go down? I don't, I don't want to tell her that fine tacos here. We thought, I thought we're going to throw it down. And he tackled me and I was like, God damn. And he held me and just kind of chipped away and he was good enough that I couldn't finish them, but he wasn't good enough to pass my guard. But he was good enough that I couldn't our embargo and we got broken once and that was when pride had those 10 minute rounds or broken once and then dumb me the second time I thought, okay, we're going to stand though.

Speaker 3:          01:32:47       And boom, he shot for a tackle. Yeah. Yeah. That was frustrating. He was an interesting case because he was one of those guys that sort of tested this. We were in the beginning of MMA when people would watch the various styles and the various strategies that people would be successful with inside the octagon, they would try to figure out what is the best way. Is it the best way to be a big wrestler? Well No, if you fight Maury Smith Cause Maury Smith figured out how to be a smaller guy. Chip away at the legs of Mark Coleman. Take it into the later rounds and that's how he won the title. He won the title with stamina and with his striking. Yeah. But then you see a guy like Mark Kerr and who was like the very like as far as you could go with like the big steroid it up muscular frame and wrestling.

Speaker 3:          01:33:36       I pull up a picture of Mark Carr. Mark Kerr in his prime was his nickname was the smashing machine and the specimen. Huh? I got the specimen smashing machine and he was a, a big wrestler who didn't have like a lot of skills as far as like submissions. Like he submitted a guy what a can opener wants. Probably the only guy I ever late. There was Jesus fucking Christ that is barely human. He was fucking gigantic, man. Yeah. That's the one I fought. He submitted a guy, he submitted a Dan Babish by putting his chin in his eyeball. He talked to his chin into Bobas wishes, eyeball and fucking and crushed his, his head into his own chin. It's like he pulled his chin into the, like the guy's eyeball and tapped him I think in mountain him and did that stuck his chin and his face.

Speaker 3:          01:34:31       Wrong. Strongest fuck I bet. Right? Yeah. So the strongest guys I fit. Yeah. He was as big as you could get and still do MMA. That was like that. He was the s like that example, like for example, the big strong wrestler, he was the most extreme version. It was real successful in the beginning. Oh yeah. Real successful. But it seemed like the wheel started to come off after a while. No fighting. No, no. He did a few fights afterwards, but after the smashing machine documentary came out and the folks have never seen that documentary. That is, he's got an incredible amount of courage for letting people into that world because mark had a significant problem with painkillers and with drugs and showed it all in all of its, they, they started that documentary wanting to do a documentary to follow one of the best mixed martial arts fighter in the world, the smashing machine, the guy who a lot of people thought was the heavyweight to wash and along the way they, they caught it at the perfect time where he was starting to unravel and they got to see a guy whose life was just sort of falling apart.

Speaker 3:          01:35:37       That was, that was pretty crazy. This is trends. It came out and shoot himself up all the time with all these painkillers, painkillers or a motherfucker, man. Yeah. That's a big thing, huh? Oh yeah. Yeah. Their opiates, very addicting. Never tried them at all. No. No painkillers at all. I never tried any drugs that marijuana. Did you ever like have a surgery or anything like that? No. No surgeries at all? Nothing. No. No knee surgery? Nothing? No. How the hell did you manage to go through an Lma career? With no surgeries or luck. I love you man. The worst. I had to think it was the orbit of crack from the Oit Royce Alger fight for Royce Alger fight. Horrible. Okay. That's what happened. That fight. You don't, when you interviewed me I was fine and it went to the back and I felt my nose was bleeding, so I blew my nose in it.

Speaker 3:          01:36:26       Just whoa, that's crazy. And it just filled my eye up with air. And then the doctor came in and said, you can't fight. And I was like, no, no, I'm fine. Please let me fight. I still can see. That was the who? Tito Tito. It took your place. Wow. Historical Shit. You know Tito Ortiz was molten. It historical shit. What did you think about Tito Ortiz fight in Beltour? That little guy, he fought flamenco. Well, I was hoping he did beat the guy up because I was thinking of that guy shouldn't be calling on every week class. It's ridiculous. And I, I didn't know what he was thinking. Yeah, I'm glad. And he even knew what he passed them all. He knocked the wall. Yeah. Put him to sleep that was wanting to see what the head and arm choke. That was nice to see. Yeah. Tito's got a really underrated submission game.

Speaker 3:          01:37:10       A lot of people don't give him enough credit for a submission game. You know, he, he's big too. Fucking huge. Yeah. He's like my weight class and I, when I, I just saw them the other time at one of the events, he was a guest then. He's huge. He's enormous. Yeah. It's hard to believe he even makes two oh five when you look at the drops, good weight. Manko is like my size. He had no business being in the cage with Tita and Tito. He called, he's the one who called Tito out. Right. I don't know what that's about. And Tito's sort of sponsored him too, which is a lot of people thought like some fuckery was afoot foot. They're like, wait a minute. Cause Tito like teen punishment. He represents team punishment. Really? Oh, that's weird. Huh? I don't know. I mean maybe they just said they can make some money. Let's just do it. And she'll Manka wanted to test himself. Uh, I don't know. You know, but,

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       but when you see the two of them inside the cage at the same time, at least they look, it's like a giant is fighting a little mat and Tito got him to the ground. Man. You just saw that weight and pressure and just submitted them pretty quickly. Like we have the difference in the size there. Yeah, I get that. This is crazy, but good for Tito. Get that wind back man. You know, that's one thing that bums me out is that people don't, I mean I guess Tito kind of brings it on himself sometimes cause he says a bunch of crazy shit, but that guy doesn't get enough credit. He, a lot of people disrespect him. Tito's or real. He's a real pioneer. Yeah, he is. Oh yeah, for sure. He, their bag with you in 97 and really Tang Abby. That's the time. Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:38:37       Yup. Yeah. I mean that's when tank Abbott was the Huntington beach. Bad boy does sort of became bad boy somewhere along the line. Right. Wow. Yeah, he was a part of tank average crew. He said he learned a lot from tank Abbott. And it's interesting because what you say about attitude and about, you know about the, the mindset of fighting, that's what he said that he learned from [inaudible] Tang. You learned from tag out. But how did you go in there and fuck somebody up and they'll just go in there and kick somebody's fucking ass. And that's what tank Abbott used to do to say whatever you want about tank Abbott. That motherfucker never passed on a fight would fight anybody. And with an hour's notice and you know, you could, you could literally call him, he'll be on a bar stool, he'd be on a flight the next day headed to wherever the fuck you wanted him to fight drunk.

Speaker 1:          01:39:23       And he would win a lot of those fights. Hard puncher. Cause he had that attitude. He was just ready to get in there and fuck somebody up. If you're there, it is Tito right next to him. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh it's a Odi tank. Habits like God damn classic. He's a classic guy. He was some wild fucking fights inside the octagon. So crazy knockout. So, yeah, I don't remember. I don't know the last time he fought, but I have a feeling it was like, I want to say it was fairly recently tank out of it or, yeah. Somebody told me that he bought recently. And let me see here. Let's look up on Wikipedia. They'll tell us one of the last time he fought, because I want to say that he fought fairly recently. Yeah. I fought in 2013. Whoa. He lost to a Reuben hurricane Villareal.

Speaker 1:          01:40:12       That's the same guy that boss route and fought on one of his last fights too. And he beat Mike Bork in 2009. So he took a, took four years off, came back and lost and King of the cage. Wow. That wasn't even, was that even though it wasn't a hyped up at all? No. It was kind of crazy. King of the cage fighting legends. Wow. That was 2013. Oh, to watch that cab. You probably didn't even know about it. Yeah, that's the problem. Sure. Yeah. It's kind of crazy that it was so, uh, you know, low profile before the ad. He fought a Kimbo slice in 2008 yeah. In Miami. That was before Kimbo when to the, he fought Yoshida, Yoshida and pride. And he got a, he got choked. Yeah. It's a lot of fights. A lot of fights. Yeah. I mean if you look at his career and there's a lot of losses in the air, but God damn classic fights. Yeah. They are classic toys and went to his, that was his first fight. His very first fight. And then Paul varlands remember that fight? It was another great fight. There it is. Can you the cage legends.

Speaker 1:          01:41:25       Oh Wow. Tank. Gambit gray beard now. Still slinging led. King of the cage is a place where a lot of guys had their start, right? Yeah. King of the cage. Where did you have your first fight? Uh, mine was in a shoot. Don't shoot. Oh yeah. Did you find Super Bra? Was that Egon funds first Superbowl once? Yeah. You fought at once. Would you find it over there? Uh, Tommy saw her and super ball was a almost like old school valley Tuto style, right? Yeah. Different rules. Hawaii had a different different set of rules that you are allowed to compete under. Like what is it? What was the rules of Superbowl? Um, at that time was more just like pride, pride rules. When I fall soccer kicks knees to the head on the ground ground. Yeah. I like those rules. Do you think that that the MMA in its current form right now, like if you, if you could change any of the rules and still keep it a sport, I think that first of all, 12 to six elbows that that's got to come back.

Speaker 1:          01:42:25       I think 12 to six elbows as it is a ridiculous thing to have band, but I think needs, needs to have grounded opponent. We change a lot of shit too. Yeah. Even soccer ball kicks. I think he's okay. Really? Yeah. You're fucking crazy. I think those, I would like those to be in. The only thing I have a problem with the soccer kicks is the cage. I liked the soccer kicks in a ring because you can move your head away, but the fact that you're trapped and you can get kicked and stomped when you're trapped up against the cage, that's the only time that I think that it would be a problem because the guy can't really defend himself because of the environment as opposed to because he's out. That would be just one more danger in a cage. There's a lot of that. That's true.

Speaker 1:          01:43:05       That's true. That's true. The people would be keeping their head away from the cage a little more. Yeah. When you look back, I mean your first fight in the UFC 1997, um, what was your first actual mixed martial arts fight? Shoot it and I need 10 96 96 daddy's the early days, man, that was right after Hickson and came to Japan. Hixon fought in the Japan valley that maybe you want to fight you. Really? Yeah. Wow. That was incredible, man. Those are incredible times. And when you look back at that and now you see the guys of today, you see like the Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson's and you see the John Jones is and these high level guys, the pound for pound best guys at today, man, it's just like a totally different thing. Yes it is this, there's, there's actual

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       fighters that are called mixed martial artists now.

Speaker 1:          01:43:54       Yeah. Full mixed martial art can do everything. It's not a karate guy. Back in the day

Speaker 4:          01:44:00       that your fighter was either a striker arrester or ground guy and it was always a real straight up strategy to fight in those. But now man, they can get everything nowadays. I mean I see the, you know, the younger fighters coming up nowadays and you know, the, some people tell me like, ah, when you fought there was no money. There was, it was so small and shit and it wouldn't you don't you wish your grandfather this day and age and I'm thinking to myself, I don't know man. He, Ken's a fighter's nowadays, man, there's full me shed. They can their black blackbelt Jujitsu's that are professional kickboxers and wrestles, it can fight boxing. You know what I mean? It's like wrestlers would blackbelt Jujitsu. It's unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          01:44:40       And it's getting better. Yeah. It seems to me that it's getting better. I mean it seems to me that the level keeps rising the levels. Just wait Tj Dillashaw what the fuck? What the fuck like kid comes out of nowhere. I mean, I thought that was going to be a real difficult fight for him. I thought like, man, Hanan Barao is a killer, one of the best pound for pound guys in the world. And then Tj Dillashaw just goes in there. One's a clinic on one's a clinic on him. That was unbelievable and there's more of those come out at then head kicks him in the fifth round and didn't ever fight like he was ahead. Dude, never fight. Always trying to finish crazy. It's good fighter, man. Fuck yeah. Great fighters that there's going to be a rematch them that I hope so. Yeah, it should be.

Speaker 1:          01:45:24       Man, I hope so. Well, there's a lot of great fights at one 55 there's so many. Oh, Dominick Cruz, you know. [inaudible] never had that division before. It was crazy. Yeah. Before it was just the heavier guys. Yeah. Well, I think they're probably going to have a one 15 to, they're going to have a straw weight. Well, there's a lot of great fighters in other countries, especially a lot of great Japanese guys. One 15 a lot of Brazilian guys. One 15 I think that in a few more women, weight classes would be good too. You know? I think they're going to do a one 25 women's weight class maybe at one 15 as well. Yeah, that'd be big. That's good. Yeah. It's amazing. Time in exciting. Do you have pride when you look back and you, you think that you were like, I mean, you were one of the real pioneers of the fastest growing sport the world has ever seen. There's never been a time in my lifetime. There's never been a time where a sport was introduced and became this gigantic thing over a matter of a decade, two decades, and groom viewable. How fast it grew and grew the way the UFC has grown under row. There's nothing like that. Yeah, it's amazing, dude. You look back on that and go, wow, I was, you know, I was in a special time in life.

Speaker 4:          01:46:37       I looked back at that and see, yeah, I love what's happening. I mean, my life has made by him in me and I just, I appreciate all the things, you know, Dana's doing the people who making it big. And you asked me if I have pride in that. No, not really because I don't feel like I can help. I'm the one who did all this. No, I don't. I just feel it was the lucky person to be the person that was actually there in the beginning to see what it was like in meeting when it was banned in states and every window, whenever someone heard you or mixed martial arts fighter, they say, well, see, beat people up for living all human cockfighting. You know, back in that day when it was like, it's frowned upon now. It's like, it's a cool thing now is so nice to see that change.

Speaker 1:          01:47:21       Yeah. It is nice to see that change. When I first was working, uh, on a Sitcom, I was on a sitcom news radio and it was when I first started doing the post fight interviews back when I interviewed you. Yeah. It's one of the first events I was a second event I ever worked at. Oh Wow. And um, I would tell people that I was going, you know, it was like, where were we at? Augusta, Georgia or something like that. Where did you find Georgia? Yeah. And uh, I remember telling people that I was going to go work for the UFC interviewing fighters after their matches and they'd looked at me like I was fucking crazy. Like I was involved in dog fighting or something. That's what it was like, like I was involved in porn or something like that. Something. Yeah. Yeah. It was like that. Yeah. Now, you know, people say, what do you do it? So I do commentary for the UFC. They go, Ooh, I love that. My husband, I,

Speaker 4:          01:48:05       well, I see that change though. It's amazing. Yeah. When I, when I see that, I mean think that I'm a, you know, I was back in, I was lucky enough to be a part of that. That's what I feel. Yeah. Back in the day, man,

Speaker 1:          01:48:16       I can only imagine from your position, so from my position I feel very lucky, but obviously I'm an outsider watching and commenting on it. You were like in the, in the, in the heat of the battle itself. Are we on the UFC one one 75 on 25 yeah. Was In 13 huh? It's crazy. 13 well not only that, you were not just at one, I think the position that you were at UFC 12 I think the, in my opinion, the support changed radically around UFC 12 because of detour. I think when [inaudible] entered into the cage, won that tournament at 19 years old, at UFC 12 the whole game changed because you've got to see really high level striking from a Jujitsu black belt. And he was, he was light, but he was fast. He was a tall total new specimen. I mean it wasn't the v tour that fought Randy coture.

Speaker 1:          01:49:08       I think that veto got too big to like two months for 204 days just to jacked. But when he fought, yeah, he was like two oh five UFC 12 shredded, strong explosive fuck Sam. And we first saw him when he's first couple of fights, man. It was just like this was a new athlete, completely new person that we'd never seen like a skill level like that as far as his hand speed, the boxing combinations that he put together. Nobody had seen that before. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I think that you came at that time, you came as a sport was just exponentially and you were starting to see like real world class athletes. I think when time, when we look in the future and they look back at this era, like the era between 1993 in 2008, I really, uh, not only around today, but still finding it the highest level. Which brings up another point. How do you feel about all this testosterone replacement shit? Um, I wouldn't do it. If I was fighting, I wouldn't do it. Um, I just, uh, I don't know if I'm for it or against it. I mean, if some of fighter wants to do it, I wouldn't have a problem with my, my opponent did it,

Speaker 1:          01:50:26       you wouldn't have a problem with your opponent doing it, but you wouldn't do it. Yeah, I wouldn't do it. Why wouldn't you do it?

Speaker 5:          01:50:32       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:50:33       I guess I wouldn't know if it would, I don't know the really real effects to it. Yeah. And I feel like I can get, I can, I could get in shape enough to fight without it. Yeah. John Fitch said something real interesting once I talked to him about it and he said, well, I get older. He said, I would definitely take hormone replacement therapy, but not when I'm fighting. He said, I want to know that everything I did, I did because I did it. I did with my hard work. I did with my mind, you know, and that, that was fitches attitude. I thought that was very admirable. You know, he's a, he's a real man, you know, Fitch lives by the sword dies by the sword. And that attitude that wasn't just some talk and bullshit. I mean, he's never been popped for PDS. It doesn't look like he's doing.

Speaker 1:          01:51:14       Um, yeah, it looks the same. He's just a tough motherfucker, a hard nose wrestler who became a great mixed martial arts fighter. But that attitude was, you know, he wanted to know that he did it all themselves. We see guys like, you know, [inaudible] it's a perfect example. We tore, got on TRT, got on testosterone replacement therapy and became this it. He had this resurgence where you saw detour from the old days, the trade Talbmen fight. He was 19 years old. He was a phenom, but Vituro f a lot of folks don't know post the Randy coture fight after Randy coture beat him, he went into a dark period where he wasn't very good for awhile. Soccer rob a, beat him up. A lot of guys beat him. Alistair Overeem submitted him. He wasn't the same guy anymore. He lost his confidence. For whatever reason, they just, Dan Henderson beat him and then he fought in the UFC, had some good fights, but it didn't look like the same guy.

Speaker 1:          01:52:10       Didn't look shred, got on testosterone replacement and then all the sudden shot through the fucking roof and became this motherfucker again. So I could see both. See that's uh, the one on the left is him pre testosterone in the one on the right is post testosterone. I mean I could see, well this is the way in his photos, by the way, these guys are completely dehydrated. They don't look, yeah, there's sick mean when you're weighing in your, your body's completely dried out. They lose over the, like Vito probably lose 10, 15 pounds easily just to make weight. But the resurgence

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       when you saw him fight Michael Bisping, Luke Rockhold and, and then the rematch with Dan Henderson, he was so fucking good. Yeah. And it makes you wonder like, what is it? Is that testosterone, is it hard work? Is that the testosterone that allows them to work hard? Like where is a kind of gray area? Like where do you draw the line? Would hard work? Definitely Ken just take talks to it and get good. He, yeah, it allows you to work harder I think. Exactly. Definitely hard work and definitely talent. And definitely his mind. Yeah. Confidence. Yeah. But that's the thing about the testosterone and allows you to get that crazy gorilla confidence. It changes the game. Right. And it does. But you know, the thing is, you know, as much as people that are against it and that kind of cool to see him. Oh, the of the fights you put out cause he's on it.

Speaker 3:          01:53:33       That's a good point. It's like bodybuilding, yet people like says fuck steroids and stuff. But when they go to watch body of, you think the, they are at the muscle tone in the size and it's like, now I might get steroids, but you go there and you love the bodybuilding and I say it's like a give and take. Yeah. Yeah. Well bodybuilding without steroids, it's almost not nonexistent to that. True. None of those guys are clean. You can't, you can't get that big. Yeah. And be clean. Be cleaned for the last year. Do they even test? I don't know what the test they do with bodybuilding, but it's gotta be a Horse Shit. You know, if somebody tests positive in a bodybuilding competition, it's probably because they pissed off the promoter and they said to test that motherfucker for real, for real. This time and pride. Did they test you at all on pride?

Speaker 3:          01:54:19       No. They had a, I mean, do you get, he didn't know that they had a clause in the contract. What clause? They had a clause that said what to test for. Oh. And they don't test for star test for, um, the historic we'd the test for cocaine. They had a whole list and not only did, did the steroids did not, wasn't on that list. They had a sentence after that saying, we do not test for steroids. Wow. Yeah. So it was, that was kind of crazy. Jason Chambers, you know, Jason Chambers, he was a show, a human weapon. He fought, fought MMA a bunch of times. He's a friend of mine, but he, um, he was, uh, they were trying to get him to fight in pride and they want him to fight at one 85. And uh, he was like, but I weigh one 70. And I was like, yeah, just to steroids.

Speaker 3:          01:55:04       And they were telling them to do steroids and he was like, what you were telling him we think you should because he's a handsome guy. They were like, we should find that one 85 and he's like, wait, what? They wanted him to juice up and look big and muscular five [inaudible] five. And he was like, I'm not wanting any five guys. You know, I heard a lot of stories about that. How pride used to like really bullied the fighters are yeah. You never know. Days Kiss my ass man. Really? It was weird cause I remember mark cursing saying something about how all rampage was caught up like one week before the soccer arba fight. And if he didn't take it, they told him something that you'd never find Japan again or something like walking him around Linkedin and the

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       same people that are bullying him around at the people that I see. And I can't even imagine that side of the character from them

Speaker 3:          01:55:51       do think it's an exaggeration. Like maybe not getting the full story from them. Um, I think it's a play of those to Japanese. Yeah. Oh, they would know what they can do either. You like, you know, like a dogs. Your dogs are mostly medium dark to you. But then when your friend takes care of him, he's pissing all over the place and barking and shit. You know, I think it's the same thing. They didn't know what they can get away with. Yeah. My friend, uh, Eddie Bravo was over my house once and he was scared of my dog. And so my dog attack the cat in front of them because he knew that Eddie was scared of the dog. He's like a head. He just decided that he's the boss because the dog, cause I was just taking a shit. He freaked out and he starts screaming and I had a run in and rescue the cat, but he just decided that Eddie was a punk because Eddie was scared of him and he could feel it.

Speaker 3:          01:56:35       So he decided I've been wanting to bite this fucking cat say way. But it was a clear example of that because Eddie Eddie wasn't used to being around big dogs. He didn't know how to handle them and you know, he didn't know that. You just got to be friendly with the dog and just establish said he was like, oh, she was always like this around the dogs and dogs. Like this motherfucker's stairs a thing. I'm running shit here. But it was a clear example, but he would never do that in front of me. Never attack the cat in front of me. But in front of Eddie, he just decided

Speaker 4:          01:57:07       that's a good example. I think it's perfect example. So they bullied. Those guys are owning these guys. Would you, do you remember the guy, the Guy Minster incident with me? What happened with guy? He fought Egan and then we had a little thing in the ring with him. Yeah. What happened? Well, he was supposed to, um, or apparently this is what he said was he was supposed to call me out in a bad way. I just retired. Right. And he, he beat Egan and they told him to call it to do that. And they told him that I knew about it. So six some purchasing bullshit thing by I not know nothing about it. So I'm here, I go into the ring after Egan losers and I'm just going, you know how you go check on your fighter? Yeah, I checked on you. Okay, everything's okay.

Speaker 4:          01:57:50       Guy Walks up to me and says, it's not personal. And like, what's not personal? You'd beat up my brother. Of course, it's not personal, Hugh, congratulations. He goes, no, no, no. What I would have to do, that's what are you talking about? And if you see the video, I'm shaking his hand and he's telling me the other shake his hand and I'm like, I don't let go of his hand. And the weird I'm there were like, I'm guiding them into the corner. Like, what do you mean? What are you going to do? And he goes, I got to call you out. I said, well, yeah, you know, I'm retired. He goes, yeah, but it's in my contract. I said, no, no, fuck you. I said, I told him, if you don't want it, do it. Don't fucking do it. And it was answered. I got to do it. And I said, don't fucking do it if you don't want to do it. And then I then I realized that the way pride plays that shit with the creditors and I realized that, you know, guy was in this position that, you know, he really couldn't do anything about. And so I was like, you know, guys, not guys deal, you know, guys, not the bad guy here. And he's like,

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       so he turned around and he did it different. No, he didn't. He didn't be a dick about it. He kind of went in, she said, uh, something about, yeah, the, the better fight would have been with his younger brother and son. But after that, it's all in the book too. But after that it went in the locker room. And I guess, I dunno, I think I'm, Gary Glitter's is in my locker room. Igor was in the locker room. Those spiders all saw this happened. But I went on a rampage to calling for the president of the pride to come in and see me right now because that's bullshit. It's purchasing bullshit doesn't work. Wow. And they wouldn't bring them. So I would always, you know, the little staff guys that year, I was kicking them around and tell him, get the president and the one of the guys come in, this guy called Kawasaki, he was a matchmaker for pride.

Speaker 3:          01:59:24       And I got on a mid term on the ground [inaudible] really as a huge thing. You throw him on the ground when they grind them all in him. And then Egan stopped me and then, and then I told him, I don't want to see you on a seat, Morty still the prison. That's when he was alive. And of course in the middle of the events you can think prison just can't come in. But the vice president comes in and then he sits me down and he says, you know, are, we didn't know nothing will get to the bottom of this. But according to guy, that's the guy he talked to. So it was in the contract that he was supposed to call you and Meagan the, and then the president wound up dead and strangled in like he hung himself on a fucking shower rod or something.

Speaker 3:          02:00:02       Yeah, that's a weird one, Huh? Yeah. Cause I talked to him a week before that and he, he told me that, um, um, or if he telling me that he, he likes the way I fight and he wants fighters to fight more like me. I remember him telling you that and he had a big image about changing the fight game into a more of aggressive fighters but wasn't that the death was very controversial. Yeah. It was uh, it wasn't suicide. Yeah. It didn't seem like, it seems like it's really hard to do a chin up from a shower curtain. Yeah, he did. I mean, how can you, those rods are not that strong. Yeah. How's that? How can you even hang yourself with one loss? Can you, he did the wrong keys. He pissed off the wrong people allegedly. Yeah. Allegedly. Allegedly. Let's leave it at that.

Speaker 3:          02:00:46       What was it like in the, in that day, like dealing with that aspect of mixed martial arts? Like it wasn't just mixed martial arts like it is in the UFC where it's a business and there's promoters and there's, you know, they have an agenda to try to promote to the fans and try to make money. But you are dealing with a very intense organized crime mass spec to it. What was that like? It was good. Good. That me? Yeah. Because of who I was in the record, the respect that I have from the other people in Japan, it helped me to it. So I didn't take me wrong and everything was straight up. Did they support Japanese fighters more? They're like, what are they excited? Their jar? Yes. They wanted the Japanese first to win. Guys like Yoshida. Well back in our day with some more Sakuraba, some short g Matsui, you know, dog fighters.

Speaker 3:          02:01:35       They wanted to promote those guys so they when they're Takada Takotna was a pro wrestler. That was an interesting situation too. Pussy. Well he was a weird one because he was one of the few guys that was in a very obvious fixed fight. His fight with Mark Coleman. I pull up that pull up to Catia versus mark homer. Cause this is one of the few fights that I love Mark Coleman and, but Mark Coleman never admitted that he, he, he did that. But I'm sure that that's what happened. Mark would never lose to icon. Well not that way either. I mean the way tap to the heel hook, it was total pro wrestling. I was like, no, I don't want to, I don't want to tap. Tap. Yeah. Yeah, I saw that. Yeah. It was like a movie. It was a weird, well TACAN does a fag. He really, yeah, he's straight up.

Speaker 3:          02:02:21       He's a fake. What is his background? He's just a wrestler just but does, he has marks on him on the street. I saw him in, in a street incident. He fagged out. What happened? I was in a club and my friend was a white students who were Ricky. Ricky Fukuda was, uh, the, the um, security there. Sit here and he's like [inaudible] like he's like punching him in the leg. You can see his punches. Coleman sits at all in these punches. But then when he's not, it's the arm punches. It's barely, barely punched him. And this was like back when Coleman had won the heavyweight Grand Prix, right leg. Like what is that about? These leg punches I come on man. Mark Holman was not about little bets if it, if you did put the leg it'd be heavy punches. Everything he did was heavy. He was the godfather or ground and pound.

Speaker 3:          02:03:12       And so he gets on top of him and he gives up his leg here and look at this. I mean he has given up the leg here. He rolls with a little bit and he see he is first of all to God is not even, that's not even a heel hook. He's not even turning it. I mean look at that. He taps but that, that you'll, it was a terrible healer who wasn't even turning it. He was just holding it. He was like, it didn't like the end and a 10 step process. He got to eight and then just hung on at eight colon. Had a task screwed up cause I'm not against purchasing, but I am against purchasing being done in the mixed martial arts or ring, well wasn't that a weird part of pride with that? There was a lot of pro wrestling guys that fought in pride, but a lot of them legit guys whose diet butcher. What was that? Uh, yeah, that was tough. Top. Yeah. Very tough. And started out as a pro wrestler. Yeah. And what was diet butcher? What was that thing? The thing that he always had on his pants that was his, like his nickname I think. Yeah. But it was the pro wrestling guys. We're the guys that had brought a lot of fans, sort of like Brock Lesnar that brought a lot of fans to watch fight. Exactly. Yeah, that's true. And Takotna was one of those guys, right? He's a fake. So

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       what was the, the street situation? Well, Ricky, Ricky for Kudo is, uh, I was training with him at the time and he, I got him a job at a security at a club that we hung out at. So we went to the club and I remember at the Caudal was there at the club and he said hi to me and stuff, you know, kind of like this, like, Hey, what's up? And that's it. And then I heard there was like a big writer at the top. So I'm worried about Ricky making sure that he's okay. So I went upstairs to check on it and it was just huge mob. They almost like a bs moving across the street. And I was also who, uh, who's fighting, I don't know who's fighting someone, what's going on, what's going on. And I noticed some of the guys as a group called the [inaudible] angle in Japan, this is like a gang, they're not yakuza, but there aren't like the gang of kids that don't give a fuck and they just get into the beat people up.

Speaker 4:          02:05:29       I mean with bats and all kinds of stuff. But I noticed a couple of them, I knew who they are. So I went and followed the, the thing to make sure that everything was okay with Ricky Rick, he's not involved in and everything. And I went there and in the beehive, when we get to the back, one guy breaks free and it's a, it's this a rugby player and he's running down when his face is all fucked up already and he's running down the street and Takata's is running after him and the kind of cc me and he goes hands and help, they're going to kill us, help, help and cause not touched his, no scratches, not a bruise on his face. And then those guys, those guys ran by man, I'm, I'm still wondering what's going on. Like whoa, shit, something. And they ran by me and they caught up to the rugby guy, tackled them, these gangsters tackle this rugby guy had him and started working on again, kicking him in the face, flower pot on the head, everything.

Speaker 4:          02:06:23       And you know what the is doing. He standing on the side screaming his lungs off, stop it, stop it, stop it and not doing anything about it. And he's fucking huge, giant dude not grabbing anybody. He's not physically stopping in. And he refused to physically get involved and he sees me coming. He goes ends and stop, stop. I'll stop them and like do this your friend. So I, I click in my head thinking I can, you know, I can plague killed two birds with one stone. I can help to Catia and I can help these guys cause this, this fight was going on for like eight minutes or it, you know, and the cops are probably on the way. So think he's, you guys got to guys get to get out of here because the cops are coming. So I'm grabbing these guys, throwing them in their van and as I'm getting another guy, that guy, that guy's coming out, it was like ridiculous. Let's, let's try to get them in the car. Five him got him in the car, got away. That got away right when the police are coming. High speed chase, they actually got caught up the street, put in prison and nothing from Takada. Not a thank you. Not a what's up? Nothing from Tacoma. And I've had, I haven't talked to him since that day. What does that got to do now? I don't know. He does some acting. He acts. That's good. He's probably better at that than fighting. He was

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       doing that in the ring was a little bit of that. Yeah. So yeah, so I, I have no respect for Takata at all. And if he comes up to me in Japan and tried to shake my hand, I'm not going to shake his hand. I'll tell before I shake your hand. You just didn't. You have somebody who say to me, cause he, I saved them on that and he's just, he's such a pussy and you know, real upsetting for me to see him in the ring at the pride in looking at Sylvan sing. Are you a man looking at rapids? Are you a man? Are you a man? Sing them like Xojane. Yeah, he said in Japanese, he'll sing it like it was about the tournament, I think. Oh Man. Are you a man? So the big theme was being a man and I think God, this is the biggest pussy asking people if they're men.

Speaker 3:          02:08:17       You know, I remember when he fought Hickson, Hickson just fucking worked them. Yeah. That was, I mean everyone who knew how shitty Tacarla was new. That ticks it was going to kick his ass. But for the Japanese people it was huge cause Takado was this to be a hero? Yeah, that was Hixon in the special time to six and fought in the UFC. Man, he's one of my biggest regrets. One of my biggest regrets is a fan is that Hixon in his prime didn't fight all the top guys like, oh, I would've loved to seen Hixon vs Coleman. I would love to see in Hixson versus a marked car. I would have loved to seen him versus a lot of guys. Man. It could have been some amazing fights. I mean we got to see him versus food. Knocky who was legit for Nakia was digital was the jet.

Speaker 3:          02:09:01       Yeah. That was a good fight in Hickson got hurt. He got a ruptured a orbital fractures. Orbital in that fight. I swole up and then he had to finish for Nakia for knock. He just went to sleep and even tap out and retired right after that. I respect the shit out of that. Yeah, I mean Hixon got on top of them and a member he gift wrap that arm across and he's holding onto his arm and just beat him down and took his back and choked in the sleep. That was an intense fight and it was a real fucking fight. Yeah. That was for Nike is good. There was Hickson's last fight too. Oh, was it? Yeah. That was coliseum in 2000 2014 years ago. 14 years ago. And Hickson was still talking about fighting years later when, um, when fader was a, the champ of pride, um, they, they x and wanted a lot of fucking money, but he's still wanting to fight.

Speaker 3:          02:09:49       He wanted to fight the best guys, but for whatever reason, it never happened. Yeah. Because, uh, I went to dinner with Hickson and his wife and his family and his wife didn't want him to do it. She didn't want him to do it. But, uh, if they're separated, no. Yeah. But Hickson was like, ah, that's the guy I would want to fight. Yeah. This is the end. This is when Hickson was at his best and I think Hickson was probably around 40 then. Yeah, he was. Yeah. And he was, you know, still at his best. And he was big too for this fight. He got muscular, probably the most muscular and the strongest he got for any fight. Cause Funai was no fucking joke man. But he got his back and here it is, got that rear naked on and boom for Naca. Just did you see him right there? He's out. He's just sitting there out fucking cold. Yeah. Okay. Actually kicks him off.

Speaker 6:          02:10:36       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:10:37       Yeah. And he's not an easy guy to be choke out to fiction living. They made it look so easy and we saw something special. I mean, when you talk to all the different Jujitsu practitioners that have trained picks and they, none of them come away and go, yeah, yeah, it's a lot of hype and none of them, no, not a single one. Yeah. Every single one would talk about Hixon saying he's the best. Yeah. Unbelievable. Yeah. You know, I, I got to hang out with them one night and talk positions with them. And strategy and stuff like that. Fascinating. Fascinating. Fascinating. Watching a breakdown fights too. I mean, we did tell him, watching him fight, watching them watch fights with top guys like Mario Sperry and stuff like that, but just showing all the holes in their game, really showing all the things they're doing wrong.

Speaker 3:          02:11:19       Yeah. Six set up an elite of the elites, you know, I would've loved to got a chance to roll with him, man. I got to, but I was a white belt, so yeah, everyone asks me, did you get to road weeks of a yeah, kind of. Yeah. Well, no you don't. He's saying I was a white belt and he was, he was, uh, you know, his kicks in and of course she's not going to go hard on the white belt, so he kind of just roll with us and beat us up and yeah. So I didn't really get to feel Hixson Hixson so I actually in a way, kind of, no, not really. I did, but no, not really. Yeah. Yeah. Even if I did, it would, might as well be me being a white belt. It's the same thing. That's what's really crazy. It's like I try to tell people like there's a law, there's levels of black belt, like it could be a black belt and then you roll it Marcello Garcia, and you could treat it like a white belt.

Speaker 3:          02:12:08       It's you're still going to get strangled. Yeah. There's guys that are just, he lines up all the black belts in Brazil and submit some will Hixon. Yeah, so I heard he'd used to do every year, I don't know about now, but back in the day. Yeah. He used to go to Brazil and line up all the black belts and actually submit everyone one by one. Yeah, he used to do that for sure. He's got back problems now though. Oh really? Yeah. He looks good though, yet. Oh, he's works out still and still does yoga and he surfs a lot, but he can't really train anymore. It doesn't do Jujitsu. Yeah. Crone was on the podcast and he said that his dad has something like seven herniated discs. Yeah. Does the issue, would you just two guys, same thing with Brown. Yeah. Ricardo Laborio. He's got like seven herniated disc too.

Speaker 3:          02:12:51       Yeah. All of them are holding out, sticking in world spots of his body. Like Ricardo, when you sit him see him standing there, he's like, he's always in pain. Really? He never fought MMA. Yeah, he did. He did. Yeah. Ricardo I think had one or two MMA fights and looked fucking great. You want me to see it? Won't pull it off. Ricardo Laborio I remember seeing him, uh, he did you doing Jujitsu seminars? I would thought this guy would be so good in him and me. He's a fucking beast is back in the day, man. He was, yeah, he had one fight and it was a draw one fight. He fought me. Noah [inaudible] Noah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       he just defended a lot. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. And it just a three round fight went to a draw and that's it. I Dunno. I Dunno. I don't remember much of that fight, but I just remember that at the time a lot of people put him in the same category as Hickson and he's like, look, we're caught and this is 2001 he had that fight and the Barrio was very, very highly respected amongst Jujitsu guys. Like a lot of the guys that roll with them. So he was just unbelievably good, very tactical, very strong technicals, bigs to solid guy. If you saw him back in the Minoa, he, he's fucking pull that fight up. Ricardo laborio versus Minoa. Yeah. You could see how he looked at the time. Oh, he's in incredible shape, but he's got a bunch of back problems too, man. Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:14:20       Really? Yeah. Yep. Well he's still rose with all those guys. You know, he's the Co founder and the head instructor at American top team. So you know, he's always there on a regular basis, but he's still rolls with all those guys. Wow. I think they had a, a, a super fight of grappling Superfight planned between him and Mario Sperry, but I don't know if that's still going to take place. But I had his back problems. Well, I don't know. I think he was still going to do it even despite his back problems. How is Marsh Berry Day? It's a good question. I mean he was the head coach of the black zillions and then for whatever reason they had a falling out and he, he wound up leaving the black zillions. I Dunno what the fuck happened. So I don't know where he is now. But he was an interesting, uh, he was an interesting coach.

Speaker 1:          02:15:04       They cleaned the Zanda they call them, does that machines and yeah, uh, when I was first starting out, I started out at crossings place in 1996. And, um, Mario Sperry was there and Myra Sperry was talking about how he got really good at triangles by making his girlfriend sit in his guard and he would just slap a triangle on, on each side over and over again. And she's like, I don't want to do this anymore. It's like, shut up and just catch triangular over and over and over again. And he's just Kinda fucked up. But he used her as a grappling dummies. Yeah. Here it is right here. Ricardo Laboriel and Manila shaved his head. That's right. Yeah. This is way back in the day in 2001 and Minoa still fucking fighting. Minoa is still going at it, but no, it was fun. A lot of guys, man, huge bias as the big circus thing, uh, attacking each other here. It's interesting how there was a lot of dudes that were heavy favorites, like going into MMA and everybody thought that Bob, these, this is going to be the next motherfucker in MMA and like solid Libero, solid Houbara. A lot of people thought like he was going to be the next Hickson. He's going to go into MMA and dominate cause he was so good at Jujitsu, but it never quite panned out. You know,

Speaker 1:          02:16:23       that's the end. Even in Japan, uh, the judo

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       guy said go into it. Yeah. She was one of the most successful, but there was one after him that came out. He, Hey, he keef on it here. I think he trained in Vegas. Which guy? What's his name? He was like a gold medalist. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know he lost to Yoshida later. He came back in Japan in font. She didn't last, but not, not Maura. Um

Speaker 6:          02:16:56       hmm.

Speaker 3:          02:16:57       Big Boy man. Let me see. I'll pull up your sheet as career. And he was raw aggressive in judo too. That's why they thought he was going to be the next big thing. Nakamura now Nakamura, he lost too. He lost he sheet. Um, he's a he fought an Astra, Huh?

Speaker 3:          02:17:15       No, it wasn't Ogawa. Oh God. I not going out ago. It's new kid man. He didn't really do much, but he was uh, he was up here. I think he traded with Baroni to, hmm. I Dunno. I'm looking at his record. I forget. Is She, is she, I think, Oh, is she? Yeah, he, she is, um, that's where I said till she is she, yeah, that was the, in Japan that was like, he was going to be the next huge MMA guy, but never pans out. Well, he fought him too young. He was just starting to get in the MFS too many striking skills. I remember Yoshida fought tank Abbott and head kicked him. Remember that? Yeah. Shana was pretty good. Strike through don with Silva too. It's a strong mother fucker, man. He was a strong mother fucker. Yeah, he sent some good fights.

Speaker 3:          02:18:02       I was supposed to be like the next big thing in Japan. Them in May, but never turned out. Yeah. Uh, is she, uh, I think, I think that was pretty cool in the states. I think he's training in the states though, you know? Yeah. No, I think he is. He's a, I think he still has a, he's still fighting MMA. Yeah. I think he's still fighting. Yeah. Well he fought in April. He fought, he won. He beat, filled the freeze fill the freeze. Who um, who fought in the UFC and before that he beat Fujita in 2013. I didn't know Fujita was still fighting. Oh, I didn't know that either. He fought in the A in Gnocchi. A New Year's card. The boom buy a car. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And before that it'd be Jeff Manson. He's won a bunch of fights and already moved here too.

Speaker 3:          02:18:46       He's trying to get residency. Oh really? Cause a Japan judo won't take them back. Oh, I see. Flight doodle. He beat Tim Silvia. He Beats Sean McCorkle. He be Kerry shawl. He then he beat Pedro his though Clayton Jones, Jeff Monson Fujita and filled the freeze. Those are all he's opponents, so he's still working at it. You know, he looked at his first fight in MMA. That ever was Yoshida. Yeah. Yeah, she does. Was just too much of it. Too much. Yeah. Too much of a jump seat. It was already adapted to MMA. Is that a big part of fighting? Like that's something that you see in boxing that I don't necessarily think you see in MMA as much as we're a fighter is brought up correctly. Like they give them tests that they can win and then you know, they test them and then they graduate for those tests in the UFC.

Speaker 3:          02:19:35       No, right. Not as much. There's a lot of guys get fed to the dogs, like real early. I mean like the Q f and stuff. Then you really gotta be good to make it into that. Huh? The what? The two F that's house. Oh, the Tuf the ultimate fighter. But I think that you're seeing now, like I watch the ultimate fighter. Sometimes you see guys gas out really quick, you see kind of low level striking and Jujitsu. I think the talent pool is kind of dry in a lot of ways in every now and then a new guy comes up like a Uriah hall who, uh, who got on the ultimate fighter and just knocking everybody out and look sensational. And you saw like real talent in that guy and the guy who, uh, I mean, Dillashaw came from tough, you know, and now he's a champion.

Speaker 3:          02:20:20       Um, just, I mean there's guys that have come from the ultimate fighter who just won the tough to this, the silver sewn in one, that ball, he had no hair. Um, yeah, that guy was good, Huh? Yeah. I'm trying to remember his name. Yeah, I forget his name. There's so many of them now. It's almost impossible to Calvin gas alum who beat Uriah Hall, who's another super fucking talented guy who came from that. But for every one of those guys, there's like 10 guys that are just, they're just not at the same level. They're not because it's such a new sport. [inaudible] has been around for ages and so many boxes that there, when you really think about it, high level MMA is only 15 years old, you know, really ab it. Like we said, Vito Belfort 97 so it's a little bit a little bit older than that, but it's just so fucking crazy sport man exploding growing thing right in front of us.

Speaker 3:          02:21:13       Can Imagine. I wonder what's going to be like in 10 years though. I can only, I think when we look back at history, they look at the history and the growth of mixed martial arts of martial arts period. They'll, they'll see that martial arts grew more in 20 years than it did in 20,000 years. It exploded out of nowhere and they really figured out what works and what doesn't work. But you know what tripped me out is when a, when I first went to watch the UFC and the Vegas and I saw the fighters pictures on the billboards is I couldn't believe that. It's weird, right? I mean, back in the day when I used to go to Vegas, we see like Donna Summers and Kenny Rogers doing a concert, but man, the MMA fighters up on the billboards. It's like a total different level. Yeah, it's wild, isn't it? Yeah. I love it. It's great. I mean, the bigger Amy May gets, the better it is for me, you know, for sure. What do you plan on doing in the future now? I mean, you're making your bracelets and a, if people want to buy those, by the way, where can they get dusty for.com? The book also is available so that again, destiny forever, destiny forever.com. Yeah. Um, yeah, making bracelets. Uh, I'm doing the relief work is always going to continue up north and I'm writing another book. Second,

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       second part. Do you think that you're going to be involved in martial arts? Um, I'm not someone that's going to try and promote or someone that's true, going to try and get involved. But if there's anything that I can do like it when people asked me to do seminars, so to come and be involved in something, I'm more than willingly. You know, there's some kind of big tournament of the, the Uga, right? The underground forum. What is it as a tournament? He has to have it though to have a little little, um, like an amateur fight. Really? Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm trying to help with that too. Okay. Pulls two winners like that, you know? Oh, that's cool. Nice. I mean they given, even like when Dana comes to Japan, I always offered him if he ever needs my help, if he needs any help with anything up there now that's awesome.

Speaker 4:          02:23:13       While he's willing to help but to be involved in that way, for sure. But what about like running a school, running a gym? Again, teaching fighters did that for quite a while. Yeah. I, I'm not, I haven't been doing that actively at my gyms. I've been doing seminars. I just did one in New Zealand. I just sweat and worked with the guys at a, in Portland at fisticuffs. Yes. Cool. Yeah. So I'm doing that kind of stuff. And I think I've, I still have a lot to offer to the fighters, but sure. On about doing it every day and on teaching every day and being stuck at a gym at that, you know, 95 or even like a every day at six to eight, you're going to teach it. I got to teach a class on, I don't know if I will ever be able to live in myself to that, but yeah, my life's exciting man.

Speaker 4:          02:24:00       Traveled all over trouble all over the world. When you do these seminars and uh, you, um, you sit down with young fighters, how much of the seminar has to do with mindset and how much the seminar? Half of it? Yeah, so what I do is, um, for me, I, I have the techniques to have on the ground in real basic techniques, stuff that worked. Um, I think I have more to offer into the mindset. Yeah. So mine is always like a seminar. Slash. Philosophy. So I will talk and then I'll show a technique and then I'll ask him a question and then I'll, and you know like, like one thing I asked them that the New Zealand, when I went to New Zealand did one in New Zealand. I asked him, you know, I asked him, well why do, why do fighters tap? Like if I asked you that you why, why do fighters tab?

Speaker 4:          02:24:46       Because they're afraid of injury. Yeah. And so they're essentially, they've made a decision, I would rather not get my arm broken and just admit defeat. That's, that's in the lines of it. But basically where a fighter taps is because he's anticipating what he thinks is going to happen. It's an anticipation of what you think is going to happen. And that's why fighters tab, you're anticipating your arm breaking, you're anticipating going asleep. And a lot of, a lot of times people that the spectators think it's because of pain because it hurts. But a lot of times it is a, you know, you don't harm partners and really hurt. I mean, you can feel like I, you know, y'all fuck my arm, my ligaments are going to start stretching off. Fuck know. But

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       it's not to that pain, that pain level where you like how far I get. So sorry I got a tap. You know that you've even talks, it's not like you, you'd know it's this anticipating what's going to happen, you know, and I kind of develop on that kind of stuff. Like you know that kind of mindset. Yeah. That there's a brief window where you can pull victory out of the jaws of defeat by not having the mindset that it's, it's, it's a focus here. How many of those moments happen where a fighter like has that that door opens and either you can tap or you can push forward and occasionally the guys put forward and wind up winning doesn't some of that, that's that gray area, right? That's that weird moment that do or die moment that you feel like with the Jason High type situation that the fighters aren't allowed to express and push through it.

Speaker 3:          02:26:14       Then I'll have to show how tough they really are. Yeah. When guys talk to you in seminars you have, did they talk about specific fights and ask you about specific moments in your career? Like what would one comes up that you are fight come out? Of course right before it comes up a lot. What about the Randy fight? The Rodney fight, I'm not that much, but it's always the one that's mentioned. Yeah, it was a big victory. Yeah. That was a huge victory for me. Yeah, that's like my claim to fame kind of, you know, that kind of, that kind of put, you know, what was good about that was that that victory made people accept that, okay, Anson is good and after I they need to prove that I was good by getting wins. So, so it kind of gave me that window to fight with my heart.

Speaker 3:          02:26:55       Know that I didn't need to pull out the winds anymore, but back in the day. But unless you pull out certain wins you like, he's just a tough guy. Well, that's a crazy thing about you is not just your approach, but your openness in discussing that approach. The fact that you weren't necessarily pursuing wins as much as you were trying to find out about yourself. That sounds like, you know, that sounds like something that someone would write about someone in a movie. And I mean like you wanted a white about some crazy warrior and a movie. You know, I'm not about victory. I'm about, you know, finding out the answers for myself. Who am I as a man? But that is really how you lived. Yeah. And at the time it was stupid, but not, no, but it's not. You say at the time it was stupid.

Speaker 3:          02:27:39       I don't necessarily think it was, it's definitely not stupid. Why didn't you do this? She could have won the fight, but as a decision that you made the same way Diego Sanchez makes those decisions in a fight. The difference being is I think Diego is just hardwired that way. You know? I mean, maybe you wore too in a sense, but those things and those moments define you in a lot of ways. There's a lot of fighters from that era. But when people talk about guys with a ferocious mindset, you're one of the ones that always comes up. And that's one of the reasons why people want to see you at a seminar. I want to talk to you, want to hear you on this podcast. You know the funny thing about that is that I had so many fears too. But you're open about that. And like we talked about before, you embrace those fears.

Speaker 3:          02:28:27       You, you face them head on. And that's one of the fascinating things about you is that you were so willing to discuss it, but honestly, no fake tough guy. Bullshit, nothing. No bullshit man. No bullshit. Yeah. Even the book is all real names, man. Real incidents. Exactly as, as men. And I always live my life thinking that, you know, if I get punished for something that I've done and I did it and they say the right thing and I get punished for it, then let it be because that's what's supposed to happen. So if I get into trouble with stuff that I wrote in the book is I'm not bullshitting. I'm not talking shit about nobody. I'm not bullshitting, I'm not exaggerating. I'm just telling things as it is and if I'm going to get in trouble for that, then it was meant to be. Where can people get stuck? Man? Same thing. Destiny forever. It's on Amazon. Okay.
