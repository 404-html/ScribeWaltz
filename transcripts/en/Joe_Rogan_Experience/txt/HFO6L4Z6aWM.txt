Speaker 1:          00:00:04       I gotta make sure my shit is off. I don't want to be that guy. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight, but you already know this. I've said this a thousand times. I've been using my fleshlight actually for real for the last couple of week or so. Allila yeah, I guess some night by yourself or yeah, by myself. But I got that massage, that IC massage stuff for your back. That makes it hot. Yeah, that makes her, it feels like, no, it makes it cool. Like, like tingly. Anybody using that? What? Yeah, that's the stuff. Like that's like tiger balm or something? Is that what you mean? Yeah, it's the one that you just buy it. Like the grocery store. Is it lube? No, no, it's, it's like massage oil for the cold one on my dick. And it doesn't seem like you should do that. I've had, I've used the hot one before while having sex and it destroyed the girl's vagina and it was the worst night ever. But the cool one, you can get away. What happened? Uh, I, I always thought for some reason like massage oil and oil and all that, you could just put it in the vagina. You know, like I just never really occurred to me that the vagina, like it's a cabinet. The shine is just some shit you use area you could put things. Yeah. So like human tissue that absorbs like toxins and chemicals. I know, I know that now because she's screaming her name, route or holding.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       It went from like hot, sexy time to fucking bitch ass time. But ouch. But the cold one you can kind of get away with. Like I've used the cold one on a girl before and I, you know, I just didn't tell her why, why would you do this? Cause I didn't know this was back when I didn't know. And I thought it was just lotion and I used it and she never said anything bad. It was the hot one that got me in trouble when you used it. Like what was the purpose of what we Berlin for Lube for? She wasn't enjoying in the ass and they're like, Oh hey, I think that's even worse. Dude. Yeah. I think probably your pussy is a little more durable than inside your asshole. And we also used to always go ask the pussy pussy to ass and never thought about it cause I never thought anything about poop.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       Now that I've dated some porn stars, they know everything possible. That what they Ohio girls, they don't know that just fucking get infected and die. What happened? So you could die from that dude. You sticking point. We know that now that's fucking wrong. And they should train those Ohio, Midwest people about this stuff. Somebody should at least bring it up. It should be something you talk about it because I think about that the vagina is right next to the asshole and you're barely telling them about putting it in the vagina. Like had this putting in the asshole ever even come up. But yet in real life it comes up all the time. Exactly. It's fucking that school for you. That's birds in it. That's Horse Shit and well I'm glad you never killed anybody with your poop vagina antics. I feel bad that you should feel it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:47       That's why I don't feel bad using the code lube on my fleshlight. So, uh, this cold lube, would you recommend this? I mean, is this, this is a safe and yeah, it's going to fall off. I keep using is probably not safe, but it feels really, really good. When you're your Dick's, like on ice bar, it's throbbing, strange land. Here's changed led and it numbs the fleshlight even more. Don't do it. They'll listen. Don't do not. This is nothing we endorse. I Dunno what adverse effects that's going to have on your Dick. You Silly Bitch for ladies and gentlemen, the regular folks out there only use like actual real sexual lubricant. Schlub flesh lube is something that the fleshlight cells, fantastic stuff you don't need to do. And you know, honestly, now that I'm thinking about it, I think you're only supposed to use water based lubes and her flashlight because they bill it like destroy them.

Speaker 1:          00:03:32       So I probably am fucking up my bitch pretty bad. Oh, what are you doing then? Man, I'm destroying my flesh that I got an extra one. If you do but don't do it. It's, it's a worthwhile thing. You can keep one for years. I know, but this is the chin, a haze special additional and that is drawing in a haze is butthole. Does it ever a little signature on it? She would ever have her signature on her bottle. That doesn't even fucking make sense. I like to think you like, imagine if you're a piece was like a signature like so you know exactly who gave it to you. She didn't came me. Did you get fucking Joey Diaz? Herpes. It's right here on your ass. Let us the arteries. You fear her. They should make death squad flashlights. They would. I'm sure I forget guys. Oh you mean like we should pose.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       We did motor buttholes. Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. You have to pose for that. They have to, they have to model your asshole. Wow. That's to be down with that. If we got a percentage of the flashlight, those those girls make good money. They do. They make great money. You're more than willing to let a rubber version of your asshole would be distributed all over the world. Why Not Yours? Because you're silly. That's why. Because what are some dude just gets really into the idea of fucking you in the ass because he's been practicing on your flashlight and he dresses up like you and he goes, get your fucking tee shirt on right now and if he had your little butthole flashlight that would come so close to completing the, that's all he needs. No. All he needs is rufinol and to duck tape and he's going to fuck you on video or CIF.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       Yeah. I don't think you should be like sending people the wrong message and the wrong message clearly as you can fuck my fake ass olive garden butthole. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          00:06:58       Well, good experience. My Day Joe Rogan podcast, my night all day,

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       my man, my man got here and saw the whiskey on the table right away, cracked it open. We're not even looking at 2:00 PM and he was down. I have to drink off my Vegas. Is that what it is? Dude? How, how bad was it for you? What'd you guys go? What does the fights, you've answered the fights. Uh, it was awesome. And then, uh, that night we went out to, uh, we had 10 vice guys there and three of them I got calls the next day because of the limos had their wallets and then three separate guys, three separate cars and lost or won. Wow. Pocket pickpocket dudes must thrive on that. And they see those stumbling guys on Monday morning that are barely together. Yeah. So rack from the weekend. Well, the, the, the car drivers were nice. They were like, Hey, you know, I'll come around and bring it back because why?

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       Right, right, right. They'd be happy. They're going to get a tip anyway. Yeah. The, the vice, um, videos did you guys did for Dan Hardee were fucking awesome, man. That's really good stuff, man. So it's really creatively shot. It's intriguing. The music was good. The choices of when to put music and when the puts, you know, when to put no sound. It was a really interesting man. I thought I thought it was great and I was out the whole scene where he's driving. You know, I was like, this is fucking cool. I love Dan Hardee's and he's awesome. He's a quite a personality and I was really, I love the other guy to Duane Ludwig his opponent. So it was hard to watch one guy, one guy lose and one guy when it always is. But it's nice to see Dan Hardee successful yet. I love a story like that, man. I love when a guy takes like this Jamie Varner kid that fought this weekend. Did you see that? Yeah, he uh, went to small shows,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       lost all his motivation, um, started getting beat by guys that should never beat him and then all of a sudden, uh, he just, for whatever reason, and we'll have to figure it out when he talked to him, decided to get her shit together again and just train like a fucking mad man. They give him another shot in the UFC and he just goes and knocks out Edson Barboza. It was like one of the top 10 killers and 155 pounds in the world. The last time Barboza was in the ring was in Brazil. We've fucking wheel kick Terry Edom and the head and knocked him unconscious. I mean, he's a dangerous, dangerous dude and Jamie Varner fucked him up, man. It was crazy. I'd love a story like that. I love, I love, uh, to, to just get it together. Now. It's like one of my favorite things in life.

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       I love a guy who can keep it together, but man, I love a dude who loses it and gets it back. You know? That's fascinating to me and I'm trying to think of a box of it. Lost it and got it back. It's not very many because of the gorilla story is that, you know, they had the boxing film recently. Uh, both the old guy. Oh, that's pretty good. The old time guy, like who had, he had to fix his arm, but you know, picking up the crates, it was that guy. Which guy was that? Ah, fuck. Now how long ago was this movie? But 10 in the last 10 years. It's, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Braddock, Braddock. Yeah. Shit together. I didn't see that. No, I saw it like a clip of it and it looks so hokey. Hollywood. I was like, get the fuck out of there.

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       I hate when a guy who's got good, like Russell Crowe gets stuck in a movie like that. Like when you, you're, you're using like one of the best actors ever and you got them in this goofy ass movie. It's fucking fake ass boxing movie when the guys throw fake ass looking punches, you know, there's not a whole lot of guys I've ever pulled off like a real good fight scene in a movie. It's hard. It's hard to fake that shit. That's the beauty of watching it in real life. It's so crazy. If you never seen it before, folks, you owe to yourself for once in your life. If you're a UFC fan to get tickets and go to see a live event. If it comes anywhere near you, cause it's fucking crazy. It's awesome when you're right there too. I mean, I've, I've been like inches away from some of the craziest moments in, in combat history, combat sports history in the best seats.

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       Believe it or not. Or not floor. It's about halfway up where you're almost just a little bit over the top. Yeah, you're right. You're right. The best seats are not the most expensive ones. The a above angles are great angle. Especially like that first riser. I think that's what it's first writer. So, uh, what happened? You just kept going. He just kept going all through Friday. Author, Saturday, author Sunday. Yeah. I came straight here. Damn Dude. And he sleep, um, in the limos, you know, we were, we would pass out and then sort of keep going. But yeah, a little bit of sleep. Dude. I'm old now, so. Okay. You're a fucking savage. You staring out, they're going to wheels off, man. He's still going to wheels off the tracks into the woods. You still

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       do it, Huh? Yeah. It's fun, isn't it? Yeah. I wished that alcohol didn't have such a penalty. So just steep penalty on your body. Yeah. I love getting drunk. Yeah. You know, I mean I'm cool. I'm really responsible about it. I uh, I try not to do it, you know, to a point of access are though I don't ever drive, but I do like it and fucked up. That's why I like, like getting, doing shots like in Vegas after a show it's like let's just get fucked up. You know where we were when the last time and Eddie and Thompson, Laura and I have got fucked up and Australia. But like when Australia, I got no responsibility. Let's can't fucking blasted. Right. You know, but damn the prices just ruthless on your body. I'm going to be drunk still. It was kind of drunk driving. Driving here. What for real? For? Yeah, cause I, I like woke up and went straight here, so I feel like I felt like I was still pretty fucked up from last night. You really think that you could've got pulled over and arrested? Probably not. I probably would be fine, but it felt like I was bugged still from last night. Damn Dude, you're going wheels off to both of you mother. Motherfuckers putting me to shame.

Speaker 4:          00:13:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:02       I'm not putting you to the shame when I anyway, can you just, I don't know what I'm allowed to say on there. You can say anything about whiskey. Don't say too much. Don't get crazy. What are you gonna say? I was going to say, you gave me something. Jack Daniels. Jack Daniels. Honey, he's my new thing. Let's do shots of that. Is My new thing. Delicious for poison. As far as poison goes, it's the best top. What's your, what's your poison man? Eh, well I love Whiskey, but you know, I like Shitty Irish whiskey. Like Bushmills. Really? That's kind of stuff you like. The more expensive scotch is that more tastes like Scott's, Scott's the socks. I like to just drink it all shitty whiskey. Really? That's interesting. Is that, is that common?

Speaker 1:          00:13:46       I Dunno. I've, cause I thought like the smooth stuff was the stuff that was like really old, expensive. That's really smoky stuff. The I like Pete, which is Irish whisky. Tastes like Pete. They boiled over peat bog. There's a, the only time I've ever had really good whiskey is a, there was a guy named Josh Lieb. He was one of the writers on Newsradio. Right. A very funny guy. Very nice guy. And uh, he was, uh, just a really interesting character and he was into like really old whiskey and I, and I, I was like, how much does that cost? And he was like, it was like something saying like a hundred dollars a glass or something like that. But really I'm like, what the fuck does it tastes like? And he let me try some of it. Cause it was like, wow, that is a kind of a strange thing to have created. It's a very, a very distinct sort of taste. But I wouldn't say it's good. Right? Yeah. No, none of it's good. No, just cheap whiskeys. Yes. The feeling of it is good. Yeah. So, uh, where are you coming back from, man? What's the latest world travels? Well, we'd been shooting a lot, so we shot, um, January and February and Afghanistan. Whoa. Which was seriously heavy

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       because we did a story on child suicide bombers and so we got incredible access to kids who actually were caught, uh, before they could ignite their vests. And then we met the senior Taliban guy and in Qubole who is supposedly supposed to be in Pakistan, but we actually interviewed them and Qubole and everyone's freaking out about that because they didn't know he was in Kabul. You sat down with this guy? Yeah. Yeah. Whoa. What was that like? It w he is a, you know, they don't have a good outfit for sort of looking benevolent. Like they look like he looked like the devil. He looked really bad and evil and uh, I asked him about a child too. So I bombing because they're using younger and younger kids now because they get past the checkpoint and uh, he said, yeah, you know, he, they actually admitted on air that they were using children as suicide. That's as transportation devices for dynamite.

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       Wow. You mean that's, that's the best way to describe it. Transportation devices for dynamite name. They've essentially said, you know, not only were willing to kill our own, we'll kill innocent. Can we kill children to further our agenda? That's scary shit. That's fucking scary shit, man. What's it like talking to that guy?

Speaker 5:          00:16:18       Um, well, you know, so he had, he was arrested for kidnapping, um, westerners and UN people, um, and he had been in prison and then somehow gotten out pat in Pakistan. So the Pakistan, he said I'm out. And then he had snuck back into Qubole. So you're meeting a guy who's been arrested many times for kidnapping and Westerners for political means. So that's weird too, is you go out and he's surrounded by his talent soldiers. So he's got like 20 or 30 guys in their courtyard, all sort of, you know, checking you out and then if you say anything wrong or do anything wrong, then you, you know, they'll just, they'll just take you away. They don't give a shit. Right. So it was a bit nerve wracking and he was, he's a seriously bad dude. I mean, he was a commander and then we've had Janine and then he became Taliban and then was one of the senior commanders when they were in control of, of all of Afghanistan and then had to flee to Pakistan, announced back. Do they know who lend them out and why? Well, the Pakistani government has been sponsoring Taliban

Speaker 1:          00:17:27       almost, isn't it incredible? Then like they can get people into jail over there and then they can just sort of let them out. Really bad guys. And people have tried so hard to capture it. Just they're resisting this whole idea.

Speaker 5:          00:17:42       Well it's also 100% corrupt. I mean, you can buy your way out of jail and Pakistan buy your way out of jail in Afghanistan. But if you're on the right side of the Isi and Pakistan, which the Taliban are, then you can do whatever you want. Or the ISI. We're the ones protecting been loud.

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       So what is, how does something like this, I mean, whatever you can say about it, how does something like this get arranged?

Speaker 5:          00:18:06       Well, in Afghanistan we're lucky because it was a guy named Sam Michelle who runs a total news, which is the sort of main news, you know, pro western say news in, in Afghanistan. And so he, um, you know, had a lot of, he ha he can get you sort of see anybody in Afghanistan. And so he got us in to talk to the suicide bombers, the kids, and he got us in to talk to the secret police about that. And he got us in to talk to, um, the Taliban. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       So you set up this meeting with this guy and how long has the entire meeting? Maybe an hour. So how long have you were in his, in his presence, the whole time you were in his presence or just straight in and start get up? How do you, how do you get out of that kind of conversation? That seems like a conversation that should take a hundred years. Huh? A CG. Do you have to tip toe when you're discussing things? Do you biting your tongue? I had to ask him a lot of unpleasant questions. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like how did you do that?

Speaker 5:          00:19:07       Well, you know, for example, I'd say, um, you know, you were [inaudible] in general, you know what it's like to lead troops, you know, these people train to fight. How do you feel about sending, you know, six year olds, you know, to, to be transportation devices for football? And, uh, so you couch it in such a way that like, you're a general, because generally a lot of the Taliban fighters themselves, you know, don't, don't condone the suicide bombing. But he did. He said, well, he wouldn't answer it. He said, there's a past June saying there's a tiger above me in a river below me. Like he, like I'm screwed if I'd even scream to her if I don't. So he wouldn't, he wouldn't talk to us about it. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:19:54       How, how often are, they haven't suicide bombs go off over there

Speaker 5:          00:19:59       about 200 times a year. So nearly every day there's a suicide bomb and they're getting more and more effective. And uh, it's, they just had the, the, the first civilian suicide bombs. So, you know, and not, not military targets. And it was a complete, does that, they actually did a, they had seven suicide bombers. Not a lot of people maybe know this in America, but there was an empty building across the way from the American embassy and they have these seven suicide attackers actually dressed in burqas with their weapons under the workers take over the building. And they held the American embassy hostage with like a full on fire fight in the middle of Kabul for over 24 hours before they could kill these seven dudes. It was crazy. We have footage of it all and it's totally fucking insane. Holy Shit. Yeah. But the, the what the Taliban guy says and which is pretty interesting, is that they used suicide attackers and suicide bombers because that's what's going to get America out.

Speaker 5:          00:21:03       And you go, well, you know, fuck you. But in reality that's true because what happened is America went into get al Qaeda and the Taliban out of Afghanistan and now our government is negotiating with the Taliban to see exactly how much power they'll have when we leave. So you're like, okay, well Jesus Christ, what a cluster fuck. Yeah. This, none of this is being reported in the mainstream news. It's not being certainly not being talked about like that. You see Karzai's sits down with Obama and they all seem to be, uh, playing nice, nice with each other. You know, this is all what's going on behind the scenes. Just, yeah. I mean, it's been reported. It's been constant suicide bombing. It's been reported that they've started to negotiate with the Taliban. And I was surprised that there hasn't been sort of more outrage because people, I guess are so sick of the war, they're just like, well, fine.

Speaker 5:          00:21:57       You know, they're negotiating with them. But so whole reason negotiating the United States is, and, and the, uh, NATO and what do they then negotiating power when the Americans leave, how much power they'll have, how they're going to share power, et Cetera, et cetera. Wow. Yeah. Um, isn't that what the whole purpose of this was trying to stop those guys? Yes. And then they're negotiating with them about how much power there yet. Yes. So what does that mean? That means we lost the war. Americans ever gonna say we lost a war. We were like, we were like that dude. You could beat a dick in the dirt for a hundred years. And we were like, that wasn't even a war. It was a conflict. It was a police action. We will never admit that. We need, we don't even have a bit, we lost Vietnam. We pulled out of Vietnam.

Speaker 5:          00:22:42       It's like whatever got tired of kicking your ass. This is a weird country, man. Yo Africana. They for sure 100% loss. Afghanistan. I mean, what did you do? You know what happened? You went in to try and get the Taliban now, now you're negotiating to give them power back, 10 years, all that money, all those lives. And for what? What's the end result? Because actually when you're there you realize, oh the minute the Americans leave, there'll be a civil war. So it's going to be back in the, in the exact situation of a civil war with a, with a, a massive Taliban presence in Afghanistan. So 12 years down the drain, my God, what a mess, how horrible must it feel to the families and people lost children over there. And then you just realize this whole thing was a cluster fuck. The thing that gets me is just how does anybody look at Vietnam and not learn? How do we not learn? It's like this is the same shit. It's exact same shit. We get manipulated into these wars by my special interests. And this is exactly what it is folks. And you've been tricked

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       into thinking that this was some fucking some justice mission. You know, it's madness. What do you think they're over there for? What's the, what's the number one resource they're trying to grab over there? Who? The United States? Well, I think they got into a war. I shouldn't say the United States. What I should say is the corporations that are trying to, I think, I think that a profit from it. Look, I think they had to go in because they couldn't just go into a rock or rock was about oil. Um, they couldn't just go into a rocket. They had to say, well, we'll have to go get the guys who did this for nine 11 and then they went in, but they could have gone in with a surgical team. Got The guys that got out. I mean, they don't have to take over the whole country.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       Right. Why do you think that they, they had to say, we're going to go into Iraq as well. Excuse me, Afghanistan as well. Like why? Well, because Iraq was a complete construct. They made it all up. It was 100% of their like they try to tie Iraq with nine 11 you're like, well, I just had nothing to do with it. A rag, 100% to do with w with oil, with oil. Well, because they had the manufactured why we went there. They the at nine 11 was like yes, they already had plans to go in there before but not in would say yes, you know, we're going to go in there after all kind of, but they knew that they had to actually go to the place where it was. They had to do the true thing so that they could get what they wanted, which was a wreck.

Speaker 1:          00:25:06       Oh, so you feel like Afghanistan was almost like a secondary operation? 100% whoa. And then it became the primary operation because it was such a cluster fuck. Well, what about all the resources that they keep finding over there? Like they just found trillions of dollars in minerals. Do you think that that plays a part in the, uh, idea to, to occupy it as well? Maybe. I mean, I think that now what's happening is Chinese companies are coming in as they do because they're sort of, um, not blame free, but there are sort of like, oh we haven't been conflicted by this conflict so they can watch like they've done in Africa, you know, wherever America sort of, you know, piss people off or done bad things and trying to just comes in and says, oh we'll trade with you. That's gotta be a trip man. Cause America goes and sees things and you know, for, for better or for worse, let's try to fix it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:56       Then there's problems and then they put sanctions on people and trying to just says, I don't give a shit what you do. Wow, you can do whatever you want. You could just give me your Tridium or whatever it is. Wild China just rocks at game of Thrones style. They go old school empire ways. We don't impose any, we got our own fucking problems. We've got a billion people living on one patch of dirt. And exactly. Wow. Yeah, they'll always going to beat it. A Americans with that attitude. As far as business goes and getting into creepy places, they'll just sneak right in. So there in Afghanistan you think trying to get these minerals? Yeah, well for sure. And Chinese companies are in there. I mean there's a lot of companies in there, but the problem is going to be stability because the minute the Americans pull out, it's going to be full on civil war. So you can't really

Speaker 5:          00:26:43       go and get minerals on people shooting rockets.

Speaker 2:          00:26:46       Now knowing what a cluster fuck it is, knowing how crazy it is. Was it like being over there? You as a person, as an and outsider, Canadian in facts out there watching this fucking chaos and filming it. Wait, what was that like for you?

Speaker 5:          00:27:00       You know, I, I got on the plane to come home and I was on my motherfucking drink now I was on my iPod or the iPad and you know, it was does, there was a plane, you know, it was like soaring through the air and you can see space and all this stuff. And because when you're in Afghanistan, it sort of feels like 5,000 years ago because everything is sort of, you know, these sort of mud huts and it's sun baked and it does, it looks like it has a lot of, it looks like it hasn't changed, uh, in 5,000 years. So you, you're really sort of, wow, this is maternity, you know, this is the modern age, this is the 21st century because we have all these crazy things that you can sort of tweet from Afghanistan or whatever technology. But then at the same time you have this, you sort of devolution, you know, where we're sending kids to to blow our shit up, you know, because it, it's effective, you know? And so I was, there's been a lot of what I've seen this past year, this past year of shooting, which is, it feels like half of humanity is just going completely backwards, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       now seeing that and then flying back into New York City. What, what, what the fuck does that contrast feel like? Do you take these mad trips? And I wanted to come home. And you see what's possible at the apex of civilization right now as far as like, you know, cities and in a place where he can go safely and the place that doesn't have, you know, guns and bombs blowing up constantly. I mean, no wonder why they, that's where the terrorist attacks occurred. Now wonder why that's where the September 11th attacks occurred. Right,

Speaker 5:          00:28:36       for sure. I mean, it was, you know, incredibly successful. You know, when you fly in, you still see that the twin towers out there. And actually we started our peace with that because we say actually the most successful suicide bombing of all time was nine 11 suicide attack because it started the Iran Iraq war. It started Afghanistan. Um, you know, both of which are still going on and you know, completely polarized the world. And it actually, suicide attacks were, and when we did the research, it was a few months ago, and I've had a few ales, I don't quote me on the exact percentages, but the percentages are insane. It was like suicide attacks where three to 5% of all terrorism before nine 11 and now they're like 97% of all Jesus Christ because it's so successful.

Speaker 2:          00:29:29       What, what is it like as a sane, rational person traveling around to the most fucked up places on earth and seeing humanity at its worst? Wait, what the fuck does that feel like?

Speaker 5:          00:29:41       That's a hard question.

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       You're such a nice guy. You're such a jovial guy. Every time I see you're smiling and hugging people, you seem like such a, a warm and friendly person for you to get thrust constantly into these horrific situations where you get to see people just handed the shitty it's fucking hand of cards and the history of life. Like here you are, 2012 the Internet's here. The fucking, you know, the age of information is here, but you're involved in some sort of crazy religious war and people blowing themselves up when they're six. You were in the worst spot.

Speaker 5:          00:30:16       Yeah. Well, I mean you, the reason why I'm happy is because you're thankful for what you have. When you see what uh, you know, everybody else doesn't have, well you happy before you did all this, you, I'm a pretty happy guy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:30:29       So it just enhanced your happiness to see how fortunate you are and your circumstances. Yeah. Fuck man, that's a, that's a serious trip to be spending a large percentage of your time on this earth. Yeah. Seeing the, the terrible spots. Most evil like trying to fly into Hawaii for the weekend and chill and you're, you know what I mean? You're spending your, your, your job is to go to some of the scariest parts on earth.

Speaker 5:          00:30:54       Yeah. Um, yeah. It doesn't seem that freaky at the time cause you just, you want to get the story and like, yes, we got into, you know, Somalia, you know, we're going to hang out with the pirates. They're like, yes, we've been working on that for a while. Did you guys go to the Somalia and hanging out with the pirates? Oh my God. And then you, but then you get in there, you get in there and you're like, you're nervous and you know, fucking, you didn't think they would kidnap you. Well we paid them to kidnap US cause it's a, you pay the kidnapping fee. So the kidnapping 15 grants. So you pay them what they would charge for a kidnapping, but not to kidnap you. Well, yeah, which is fine. I mean it's like the same. Well, you know, grants seems pretty reasonable, but that's all it is.

Speaker 5:          00:31:38       Yeah. But isn't it more for other people? If they catch like some billion, we did it. We did a bunch of shooting. We shot a lot in Kenya with, uh, with the, uh, sort of, you know, refugees and we show it around Puntland and now we're shooting in Mogadishu to round it up. But, uh, it depends on the, on the, I want to say it, but anyway, so when you're there all you're thinking about us, you know, we've got to get the shot or we got to get this and we've got to get that. And it's only when you come back and you're sort of having dinner somewhere in there. Like, where were you? Oh, I was with the pirates in Mogadishu,

Speaker 2:          00:32:09       US waste. But you don't really think about it so much at the time when a lot of people are horrified about the Somali pirates and they're like, this is a terrible situation. But what they don't understand is that those people really got fucked into that situation where they had almost no choice. The Somali pirates started out when these Somalia soldiers would, uh, go after people who were dumping toxic waste off their shores. It was killing all their fish and poisoning their people. And these are, there were a fisherman's culture. I mean, could you imagine you're a culture of fishermen and the, you know, they don't have a history of going after people and kidnapping people. They're just trying to fucking make a living and all of a sudden some assholes are, you know, driving around their boats, floating around a couple of miles out, just dumping horrible shit into their ocean and it's fucking up the whole ocean and they get to see it right before their eyes.

Speaker 2:          00:33:04       They're the, the mother earth becoming, you know, poisoned the fish poisoning and people getting poisoned and sick. So they started kidnapping them. They started kidnapping those people and demanding ransom from these companies that had poisoned their water. And then they started saying, you know what? Fuck it. Let's just kidnap anybody drives by. That's what we do now. And that's when it became those asshole corporations that were dumping their shit off the Somalia coast. They made monsters. You know, those people should be fucking held responsible for a cleanup. Just as much as they should be responsible for a toxic cleanup. They should be responsible for cultural cleanup. You know, if they could actually find out who dumped all that shit and all the different corporations involved, it's probably a whole lot of them. They could probably get a fuck load of money out of it. If the world had any code, sort of a real court, you know.

Speaker 5:          00:33:47       Well, the problem is is a lot of it was radioactive waste. So it irradiated to see in a radiated the beaches. And before that the Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish fishing companies completely over fished it and then the radiated it. So they were totally fine. It's actually a great movie called the fishing without nets, which is about that, about like they were all fishermen and now there's no fish. So they just take the same boat out and then they, then they go, wow, we're, we're working on a story in there right now about, um, the American government is financing, sort of Islam is to extremists, you know, to fight a Al Shabaab, uh, who are, you know, the bad boys over there. And, uh, and so we're, we're trying to figure out if that's true.

Speaker 2:          00:34:34       So the stories that American government is funding, funding Muslim extremists who are going to fight these bad guys set up exactly the same as what happened in Afghanistan and Sophia. And then they became the talent. Jesus Christ. Yeah. We just don't ever learn how, but how does one fix this mess that we're in? How does, how does one put the world on its back, you know, straight on its axle or art in taxes? Or does that ever happen? Does it, it's just the way people roll. We just fucking constantly involved in, in chaos and love at the same time,

Speaker 5:          00:35:11       you know, a lot of people meddle in other people's stuff and then we would have to go in and we have to save them and you're like, you know, we have to save them from whom themselves, you know, like, oh, you know, so Diane was such a bad guy as opposed to who, you know, just like drove Dale hurt. Like, you know, so there's a lot of geopolitics and you know, sort of Geo political gamesmanship has been, you know, the, the, the cause of a lot of these problems. But now it's 99% always economics. It's so if you look at, you know, we have resource based wealth or you know there's one in one in every three countries and with resource based wealth has a civil war every four years. Whereas you know, the, the remaining countries, you know, don't have any civil wars or haven't had a civil war for a hundred years. So the, the, the, the percentages are insane. So now like Afghanistan you were just saying, but a lot of the African countries now they're like, oh, you know, rare earth metals that didn't used to be worth money or no, and you know, every cell phone so that, you know, the war in the Congo is now the 10th bloodiest war in history and it's all because of coal town, which is needed to make our iPads and iPhones.

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       It's so ironic then at the height of technology, the iPad three front facing camera, HD screen, if you follow that all the way down, there's an old African boy that's picking out this mineral out of, out of a hole in the earth. It's really, that's that spectrum. It's quite fascinating. I mean, it's almost from, I mean that spectrum goes back to just the invention of tools and you know, figuring out iron and shit and fake point pulling stuff out of the earth all the way to the height of technology. Where are weird man, we are fucking strange. Human beings are so bizarre. How much do you look at life? I mean your, your experiences are far more extreme than mine and most people on this planet, I think. How, how do you, do you look at this sometimes, like it's a big work of fiction. Do you look at life sometimes? Like this is just fucking so nutty. It doesn't seem like he can be real. I mean, if anybody has seen the nuttiest you might, you might have witnessed some of the nuttiest shit on earth and come back to talk about, I mean you've, you've got in one life, think of all the fucking places you've been.

Speaker 5:          00:37:27       Hmm. Does it feel real? But we always say, they say about vice and what's the, what's the political sort of stance of I, so I said, we don't have one. It's the modern condition is absurd. There's the, you know, the absurdity of fucking this mudder. It's crazy. Like it's fucking nuts. And then when you go out and see exactly how nuts it is, it keeps getting crazier and crazier and crazier. So these get bigger stories are more insane. You know, we were just shooting in Karachi, which is a completely failed city. They have a hundred plus kill killings a night. You can hire a killer there to kill someone for 10 bucks. Actually we rode around with one of these contract killers and uh, it was, it's just shocking. The contract killer. Yeah. What the fuck is that? Like? Well, Saroo salary and my partner did that story because I wouldn't have asked as long and doing that story in the garage. He, uh, why wouldn't you Lawson? Well, I'm karate is run by gangs by like Haqqani network who are Taliban related sort of mafia gang family. And then they have, you know, various, uh, Baluchistan gangs and then they have, you know, uh, the, the heroin trafficking gangs and they're all fighting each other continually. It's insanely violent and you know, and basically you can't, if you're Caucasian, you can't sort of, no, there's no tourists there, for example, which there's no reason for you to be there. It's just complete wild west show.

Speaker 2:          00:39:01       It's so hard for people in Pasedena to believe driving around in Pasadena that this coexist on the earth at the same departments. The after picture. It's like, yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:39:11       escape from New York, isn't it? I mean, Karachi is bigger than New York and it's just where we're part of the world. Is it against Pakistan? But it's on the, on the, on the ocean and it's, it's uh, it's, it's, it's a huge city and it's just complete fucking anarchy. Complete fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:39:28       Whoa, whoa. It's a war. It's a war zone. How many millions of people live in this area? My 18 to 20 million, but all just going crazy. 18 the 20 million people live in wild west. How do we not know about this? How do we not know about this? That's incredible. People know that crotch is bad, but not like, like you described it, you described it like a movie. Steven Spielberg decided to make a movie about that and told you that that city's going down right now on earth. You'd be like itch. It is nothing I had know about that. It isn't movie. I mean you don't, you think that that's something that would be like really, really popular if no one ever talks about that. If they made a movie right now about that part of the world described the way you describe it, like a, like some crazy horror movie about civilization gone wrong. That's what it is. A Mad Max reality that's existing coexisting right now. Just as big as New York. We'd go get no way. You know what I mean? We'd go no way.

Speaker 5:          00:40:26       Yeah. Yeah. Karachi is complete chaos. It's scary as hell. Scaries Pakistanis are like, well, no one goes there.

Speaker 2:          00:40:35       Well you go there. No one goes there, but 20 million people live there. That's crazy. Just shit burning in the streets. People pop up up, people getting killed.

Speaker 5:          00:40:45       It was like running gun battles of the streets.

Speaker 2:          00:40:49       So you, you couldn't go. So you said, uh, what is it you're your correspondent look like? Sort of, she's Pakistani, she's pack. It's he, he, oh, he is Pakistani. He's

Speaker 5:          00:40:59       also snuck into the gun markets, a Taliban gun markets. When the Americans said that the war was over and the Taliban were coming across into the Northwest Frontier province and getting a thousand handmade guns, they make their own guns by hand. That was like little kids make the guns and a thousand. We're going over every day. And we're like, well, if the war's over, why is there are a thousand girls across the border every day. And so when we broke that story, that was solution, he uh, he just went back to Pakistan and his story of Karachi is fucking insane. He's got unique access, but you know, does he have, does he have footage? Oh yeah. Yeah. When can we see this video? Uh, I think that's going to go up within the next month. I buy stuff. You got to let me know that he has a video of him with like grinding around with this contract color obviously, but he's just sort of going from thing to thing with his gun and they were these moped helmets.

Speaker 5:          00:41:52       And then so you can't see who they are and, and, uh, it's, you know, that's an insane thing to do for 10 bucks. There's, there's, uh, there's a increase or maybe it's just an increase of awareness for our awareness, but there's an increase in sort of assassination availability and sort of there's been a price decrease or whatever, you know, because now we go and we see, like in Karachi, they have contract killers everywhere. We were shooting a lot recently. And, um, whereas in, in northern Mexico, and, um, they're, uh, they have, um, scenarios that get paid 200 bucks a month. And their job is just to kill people. Like there were just the fucking muscle that's there, the assassins, you know, and, um, when we were there, Juarez is actually the most dangerous town in the world for journalists. It's the same as, so there's El Paso on the Texas side, same city, and it's one of the safest cities in America.

Speaker 5:          00:42:53       And then you go right across the border and it's one of the most dangerous cities in the world, but it's the most dangerous city in the world for journalists. Number one. Why is that? Because it's the drug cartels that run it and there are smugglers and so they don't want anyone to ever filmed their shit. So instead of like coming up to you when you have your camera and saying, hey, why are you carrying that camera? What are you shooting? They just see a camera and go bang, no point in asking you a question. And they make a lot of, if you write about something, they make a and they cut off your head and they write the story on your flesh with blood and all this stuff. And so, you know, journalists just don't go there anymore. Wow. That is kind of crazy that we're right next to a third world country involved in like the biggest drug war in the history of the world.

Speaker 5:          00:43:35       Most Americans are blissfully unaware. Well, we shot the, we shot a big piece on that. And um, of course you did. How'd you get the deed get embedded? Well, we got embedded with people who are fighting. This is a pretty freaky story though. I don't know how much of it allow it. I'm allowed to say. Oh really? But, uh, well I can say a lot more. Uh, but, uh, but it's a very complex story and we're going to, we're going to cause some waves, but, uh, basically we were down in, in, in, in Mexico. Um, we'd done some, some stuff with the cartels. Incredibly difficult, most difficult stories to get right now today are cartel story cause they just kill everybody. Um, but we started hanging out with the people who were fighting the cartels, who are Mormon colonies that's originated in America, so they could keep practicing polygamy.

Speaker 5:          00:44:34       Went to a northern Mexico and they formed polygamist, um, um, Mormon colonies there. And because of the colonies did well, the cartels started targeting them and started kidnapping them and killing them. And so the Mormon colonies started arming themselves and fighting against the, the cartels. She's, so there's been a war between the Mormon colonies and the, and the, um, and the, and the narcos. And we went down there to live in the colonies and we were hanging out with the Lebaron who, I don't know if you've ever heard of, but they have a crazy story of, they had a, one of their brethren believed that he had the power of blood atonement. So he was killing all the people in the church that we're trying to, you know, mess with them. So he had about 30 or maybe at 50 children, nearly years, nearly 50 children.

Speaker 5:          00:45:36       And he had them work as assassins for him in this, in this bloody war that they had down there. This is all happening, not in the 1880s this isn't happening in the 1980s this is happening in like Blues Brothers Eighties Oh my God. And so they have this crazy war, but they arm themselves, right, because they're all fighting it within the family. And then because of that, when the narcos attack them, they were sort of armed and ready to go and bad acid. So they started fighting them. But they're actually just one colony over from the other people that they came down with who are the Romney's. So Mitt Romney's father was born in one of these colonies of land, and then they, they, now, this is the father was born in Mexico. Mitt Romney's father was born in a polygamous colony and northern Mexico Chihuahua. She's lonely and colonials and blend.

Speaker 5:          00:46:25       And actually he ran for president and they, they said, uh, they, they, they brought up the fact that he might've been illegal, illegal immigrant and that, uh, and that, you know, he, he gave us more than a polygamous calling me and site is his presidency. Uh, presidential candidacy didn't last long, at least say that the piece, but like, but his sons, his son, well, because book, you know, but he's, he actually, we say out of all the candidates, Republican candidates, Mitt Romney had the staunchest, you know, uh, stand against immigration and, and you know, it, it's, you know, and he, he sort of ignores his roots and he never talks about it. And you say, well, I understand why it's completely logical because you know, he, he, he, he wanted to veto the dream act and he said he'd publicly to veto the dream act, although his father as the poster child for the Dream Act. But you say he, you know, he, he, he would veto the dream act because he wants to get away from these stories because of the stories. When you dig into them are fucking insane. Of course he doesn't want to talk about, because polygamy,

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       uh, not battles with drug lords, you know, and, and you know, completing and kidnapping and insanity do not a good presidential candidate make,

Speaker 2:          00:47:40       how was this not mainstream? How was this, is it going to come out during the presidential campaign here? That's going to come up? We get, we have great footage. Mitt Romney's, either the official nominee yet on the republican side. I mean the, obviously

Speaker 6:          00:47:53       he will be, he will be, but he's not official, right? Yeah. But yeah, for sure it's going to come out. I mean, the thing is, is, is you know it all right? I don't know why you can't knock them out, but when people have written a little bit about it, not very much about it.

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       When you see a guy is that flawed and it has such an obvious story that that's so beyond fucked. Hmm. Does it make you feel like this has all been set up? Does it make you feel like they put him in there because they knew he couldn't win?

Speaker 2:          00:48:26       Uh, it doesn't make sense to me that that's the best that the Republicans can do. I've met a lot of smart Republicans. I met a lot of bad motherfuckers. You would just conservative and right wing and maybe they're a little too by Billy. Right? But you know, I've met some pretty strong minded, very articulate republicans. How come they never get there? How come we're dealing with these, these like second rate hacks, these guys who just fucking changed their opinion when the wind blows. Like how does a guy like that get to a position to be running for president? Because that seems like that's a weak example of what a politician, a leader can be. We've seen the JFK is, we've seen the bill cleanse who've seen the, the people that have the strong voices. When you have a guy who was a wishy washy, has Mitt Romney, who's comes from a fucking religious cult that it was in northern Mexico. I mean, I'm like, really that's the best you can do. A multi multimillionaire who his father was from another country, but as against immigration. But

Speaker 6:          00:49:19       I mean, look, the rumor is that they knew that they, the economy's going to go keep, keep going down and you know, drops aren't going to get better, et Cetera, et cetera. So they said, okay, you know, we'll just put up and also Ryan and you know, then we'll get to the next two terms after that because the economy is going to be shit. Anyway, put Jeb Bush on tap. There you go for 2016 but I mean, Mitt Romney, you know, the, it's, it's, it's funny because they want the Anti Obama, you know, so they just want to sort of,

Speaker 2:          00:49:48       they don't understand. Uh, Obama was the first example I've ever seen in my life of it where it's pretty clear it doesn't matter anymore. Whatever it takes to get into office is, you mean once, once the, the politician gets there, that's all out the window. All, all it is about there is keeping everything moving the exact same way. It's moving right now, making sure these corporations make fucking billions of dollars, making sure that the rights of the civilians get shrunk more and more every day until it gets to this global scenario that we have where the whole world is controlled by money and money is the government and that's, that's it seems to be where we're moving towards an actual real, especially this idea of America, what it was supposed to be, you know, a a government by the people. We were going to set it up. We were going to govern ourselves. We're going to have a very strict set of laws and checks and balances in place to make sure this doesn't get out of hand and become what it used to be. It doesn't work that way. How do we fix this Shane Smith?

Speaker 5:          00:50:46       How do we fix this? You're the world traveling. It's going to get worse because actually money does rural everything. And I think that you'll probably always has. But you know, if you look at, you know, communism, the synthesis of communism is that market regulates itself. And you have a small thing for infrastructure. Same thing with capitalism. David, Ricardo, Adam Smith, you know, the, the, the free market sort of doesn't need government. Um, but I, and I believe that both were up. Apologies for what was happening. And then industrial evolution, because everyone was looking around saying this is fact. You know, there's nothing, there was, you know, every kids working in coal mines, all that shit. But the reason why I say it's going to get worse, and I'm not actually, I'm actually an optimist. I'm a certain, not a doom and gloom guy, but is that money runs everything.

Speaker 5:          00:51:32       But the problem is, is the money's running out, right? So you have kids, you know, in Spain you have a under 27 years old, 50% unemployment. So you have all these young kids and there's nothing scarier than a young kid with no future. You've just taken away his future there. You know, 17, 18, 19 year old kid. What the fuck does he have to lose? And you've seen the riots in Athens, you've seen the riots in London, you've seen the riots in Paris, you've seen the riots and I mean Tahrir Square, you've seen, they're all over those human rights in Montreal. This, there you go. And young people are getting more and more frustrated, I should say protests in Montreal, they didn't really write. The problem is that, you know, well, look to have rights here. Now they have occupied Wall Street here and it's, it's not going away.

Speaker 5:          00:52:19       It's just, you know, sort of getting more and more subversive and you know, doing their own, uh, content networks and everything now. But you know, when you have young kids rioting with nothing to lose, then you're going to look for a radical economic solutions. And radical economic solutions mean radical political parties. Radical political parties hate each other. And it's the, it's the same sort of scenario you have that started world war two, incredible depression. You know, somebody comes up with a, what seemingly is sort of fixing the depression. Oh, we're all going to do that. No, we're going to do the antithesis of that. So you have communists versus fascists, et Cetera, et cetera. And both of, you know, extreme sides of the spectrum. And then there ended up warring, you know, fighting. And what's happening now is, you know, Europe has just fucked and it's getting going to get worse and worse and worse.

Speaker 5:          00:53:12       And there's going to be more and more radical politics, more and more kids in the streets. And that's when I get worried and say, hold on a second. What are we going to do? Wait until there's, you know, militias running down Berlin main street, fighting other fucking police whatevers, civil war, uh, until we step in and say, Hey, can we not fix this? Because it's just getting fucking worse and worse and worse. And sure. You see bad shit in Afghanistan. You see bad shit. And in South America, we just saw in Caracas where it's insane, higher murder rate than America, you know, with 20 million people, population, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But Europe is about to fucking explode. It's about to explode. So this all has to do with the adoption of the euro. Is that what, fuck this whole sister situation out the, the whole, because Europe is all connected.

Speaker 5:          00:54:03       All the countries are connected now I think. I think it's, we've been in a depression because what's the difference between a recession and depression and depression goes on for it? You know, it's a cyclical economic downturn. It lasts, you know, a longer time than a recession. Well, we, because of quantitative easing, all these things I economic things, we sort of kept it at bay. But right now Europe's already back in recession. China slow down in new sod down. America's very shortly going to slow down behind them and it's no, there's no way we can. And you go, okay, well it's another five years. So that means, okay, well it started in 2008 it's going to be, you know, eight years, nine years before we get out of this. So economically we had all these things that we tried to fix it, it didn't work. So now there's just no money, no money, no jobs in the system. So young people are the ones who get forced out. The problem is, is young people are the first ones who are going to go out and get a stick and start bashing shit up because why wouldn't they?

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       Of course. Yeah. I mean, I've, I've said that's the biggest problem with this country is that, you know, everybody wants to fix everything that's happening everywhere, but they don't want to fix what's going on in, in the impoverished areas of this country. When you're there, see, there was something that was released today that a study I read today rather a study on a message. It was on my message board, but I forget what the study was, what it said. The 72% of black people in this country are born to single parents and raised by single parents. That's fucked. That's just fucked. You know, if, if we, if we want to like start fixing things and we got to fix this country too, I mean if we, we this, this, this country could fall apart just as easily. When you look at giant patches where kids are growing up without any hope and that's, that's the most fuck thing. When a child like, as you said, has no future. They feel they have no future and they're angry, they feel rob,

Speaker 5:          00:55:55       it's, you know, you're saying, well how do you, how does it feel to come back to New York from Afghanistan? You know? Well, it reminded me so much of, of nine 11, but it was like the stark thing. Whereas what, what fucked me up more was when you're in Mexico, like five miles from the, from the border and shit is fucked up. Like some of them you were just saying it, some of the craziest shit you've seen generally, you know, makes you feel better about your life feel or, you know, I, I'm happy I have all these, you know, health and things. But I went to a, uh, a church run outside of warriors by a sort of born again, pastor who was a, an ex junkie and he takes in sort of the, the refuse of, of, of, of warriors into this church. And it's like a lot of people with, with severe psychological problems, people with severe um, uh, drug addictions and a lot of, uh, there was two feral children, not children.

Speaker 5:          00:57:00       They were, and then adults now, but they had grown up funeral like on the streets sort of thing. One sort of barked like a dog and, but you go and they live in these cells cause some of them have to be locked in. And like there was, you know, people with open colostomy bags and stuff with flies buzzing around their innards and stuff and they say, and you're walking around and it was like just crazy. She's fucking just degradation, like fearful people were, you know, and, and, and, and like a nightmare. Like it was crazy, you know, and, and they, they all, he has the pastor gets them to paint and all their paintings are fucking insane. Like so heavy and depressing and a lot of them are missing limbs because of, you know, gang green and, and so when you come from shooting there and then when I was just in Vegas for the fights and you walk around and we went out like to, you know, a nightclub after the fights and it's just Chanel and Louis Vuitton and this and that.

Speaker 5:          00:57:56       And like everybody, you know, all the stores on the way to the nightclub and then get everyone dressed up whenever you're like, as human beings, we just want to forget, you know, we just want entertain TV more, just spectacular shit. Just fucking lots of stuff because it's, we like to bury our heads in the sand because that's just right here. Like, that shit is happening just fucking, you don't have to go to Afghanistan. It's five miles from our border. And so you know that that's what, what you think when you come back from, from places like that. And by the way, all the guns when we were there, it's the largest hall of ammunition was over 250,000 rounds of ammunition at some point 60 ammunition and it was coming from America. And I was like, oh, that's, you know, strangely, like, no, all the guns are coming from America. All the guns, all the ammunition coming from America, all the drugs comes up from here and I'll, excuse me. And all the money comes from America.

Speaker 2:          00:58:55       Well, what was that one crazy uh, DEA idea. They're in a sell guns. The fast and the furious. Yeah. They sold guns with, with markers. Yeah. So that they can find out who's using the guns. And those guns were directly used to kill agent. Yeah. That, well, they figured that was a scam. It was a scam. And that they just pretended it was a, a mission or the mean, just the fact that they could ever justify selling fucking guns. Lots of guns to Mexican drug dealers.

Speaker 5:          00:59:27       They had the, uh, how could they possibly think that that would, they had a killer cart with the CIA, the old director of the CIA ceremonial pistol. Wow. Like, you know, it has like director of the CIA on it. Holy Shit. So Holy Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:59:48       They're just, the fact that they can say that that was an operation and they could say, oh, this is what we're going to do. The way we're going to track the network, we have to actually sell them real guns.

Speaker 5:          00:59:58       Yeah. The Mexicans laugh at it. It's hilarious. This is what the Americans are doing. Just giving free guns to the Narcos

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       in order to find out what rapists are like, I'm going to have to go get my ducks sucked a lot. I'm going to really have to find out what did it, what it's like to rate people. So I'm gonna have to do some raping. What pop? Fuck. How has no one getting, why is no one going to jail for that?

Speaker 5:          01:00:23       Well, I mean, God knows that the whole, I mean, the majority of the police done in Mexico are corrupt. So every time the Americans tried to do something with them, like it just gets, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:00:34       well, how has no one in the American DEA going to jail for that? I Dunno. That's just seems like the most ridiculous idea of all time.

Speaker 5:          01:00:44       Yeah. The worst guy, the worst guy I've ever heard about as a guy named Eldora keen and he's a, a narco that was fighting one of the Mormon colonies, but he's famous for, uh, you know, he's obviously there were drug dealers and in, so he went into a drug rehab center or he didn't, but he had his people massacre the mall. 18 different people in a, in a drug rehab center just for being in a drug Rehab Center. You know, this is a very bad guy. Um, and he kidnapped and killed some of the, uh, the Mormon, the Lebaron family. Um, but he is famous for getting caught on the other side of the board, on the American side of the border with a Mexican military, um, convoy filled with something like 15 tons of pot and they had a firefight with the American border patrol. And then they came back into Mexico and they knew who it was. They knew that they did. They knew he had had a firefight, but he went back to where he lives, which is eight miles down the road from the Mormons. And the Mexican government didn't do anything.

Speaker 3:          01:01:55       Whoa. I got a frog in my throat. Jesus Christ. Fuck yeah. Elder keen.

Speaker 2:          01:02:08       What a ballsy move. Do you want a water or something man?

Speaker 3:          01:02:13       Yeah, maybe we reach it. There you go. You need more rehab.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       This is a fridge right behind you. I'll grab you one. All right. Get some cigarettes is, that'll help. Maybe. What a ballsy move. That guy gets in a fucking armored car. Voi with weed and tries it too. I'm asking a firefight with them. Holy Shit. Now how are these and Mormon is getting around in Mexico. They all take convoys now. I don't know. Like heavily armed and shad are heavily armed. Yeah. So did they like drive around with like tanks? Like what did they, what do they do? Cause I know a lot of the drug cartels, they have tanks now. Jay have trucks with, you know, with guns and stuff. So the Mormons drive around like they're in war. Yeah. Wow. What a nutty thing. It must be for them, Huh? Yeah. They are at war and they can't get out of there. Are they trying to plan to get out of and get out of there?

Speaker 2:          01:03:09       A lot of them have American passports, but they don't want to do it with like Mexicans. Like these are like big super tall cowboy hat wearing sort of Texas dudes, but they're in Mexico, three in Mexico, and they're going to war with these drug cartels. I would think that if you're ever in a place where you're at war with drug cartels, it's time to get the fuck out of dog asked them that. What they say. Um, this is my country. This is my home. It's hard to leave your home. Wow. Fuck out of this. That's some silly nonsense to me. Uh, you know, I think people have to get over that idea. You should live anywhere. Get your loved ones together and move where it's safe. Tough Fuck Outta here. If you have money. I mean if you have enough to do it, and I can understand if you have to fight for your property, but that that's a lost cause.

Speaker 2:          01:03:49       That place. Yeah, they don't leave. It's, I mean I had the same answer and when I was in, so the Africa where shooting and there's like a lot of violence in South Africa and I kept saying to people, why don't you leave? I said, that's our home. Those people are idiots. That's crazy. That's just, it's so ridiculous. If you know there's a better spot on earth where this kind of kind of shit doesn't happen, he can look where my home is, home invasions and and assassinations and institutionalized rapes and all these things are just part of the daily equation. Then it's, then fuck it. I'm not doing that. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. The fuck man. How do we get the rest of the world anywhere near where we are here right now? Is that possible? Can, the human condition evolves so much that we could ever get everybody on a higher level all across the world?

Speaker 2:          01:04:41       Or is this just a part of the program? The spectrum always goes from the worst case scenario to the best case scenario and every shade in between. Is that just how things keep moving? Is that just the conflict, the Yin and Yang? Is that, is that the, the, the pull and push of life? That's the best question I've heard a long time. But I think it's unanswerable. If anybody, if anybody would have seen it, the spectrum is broad as humanly possible, I would think it would be you, you are, I mean, the thing is is if you, you see some things that that are, that are great, like we did a story on these scientists who are developing,

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       um, machines that can sort of harvest the atmosphere so they can take out carbon and all the harmful things in the atmosphere and then sort of reduce it to CO2, which you can make. You can actually activate algae for biofuels or you can, uh, combine them with other elements and lots of solar to make hydrogen cells. And it might sound like we're clinging at straws here, but when you start to think, wow, you know, if we had unlimited, if we have unlimited solar power and you have unlimited carbon, a, it stops global warming would be, you can make hydrogen cells or biofuels and then you can say, wow, that would be interesting because you could actually, you could put hydrogen cells and t like every new car. So every new car had to have that. So that's a whole new industry that we would run because of the patents, the only, um, effluent that comes out of a hydrogen cells as pure h or two, which we're running out of water.

Speaker 5:          01:06:16       So you say, hey, it could build a new economy, build this new world. And so when you start talking to the scientists who are really smart guys and realizing, well, you can sort of regulate, you know, the, the amount of harmful toxins in the atmosphere. Um, there is sanity. You know, there are people coming up with ideas. This could start a whole new economy. Uh, you know, sort of set us out on this, you know, great, right track and you're like, wow, and you feel really good and maybe we are going to be smart. Maybe we aren't going to put these machines to the next every factory. Maybe we are going to do this great stuff. And then the problem is, is you go to Africa or Southeast Asia and you know, we did a story on, um, you know, a lot of people are going, Europeans and Americans are going to, uh, um, Thailand, you know, to get a medical vacations, they call them.

Speaker 5:          01:07:05       So you go there and you get a facelift and two weeks of vacation on orchitis. And so, you know, then you can get transplants. He can get this. And you know, that's a more and more people are going for, um, uh, medical procedures. So it started a war between the, uh, ambulance gangs to take bodies. Uh, you know, because let's say you hurt yourself. Well, more than often than not, you're not going to arrive alive because they want to harvest your, your pieces. So Bangkok, body snatchers. So there's, there's what like street gangs that fight each other over the sort of dead end.

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       So say if someone falls and breaks their leg, they're not going to take you to the hospital. They're going to take your organs. Well, if you're, if you're injured, they're going to make sure that you don't arrive alive. And then they harvest York so they kill you. Yes. They let you die. They'll let you die. Yeah, they don't kill you. They let it, they don't give you medical attention. We never saw anybody sort of overtly being killed. We've heard about it. But you don't want to say, yeah, okay, well they don't seem like

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       they're ethical. So I wouldn't imagine that would be outside the realm of possibility. But I understand exactly where you're going with that

Speaker 5:          01:08:23       one side. You have this sort of hope, you know what, we're going to get our shit together. We're going to have new fucking energy systems or aren't going to crazy people, all this stuff. And then, and then you go see that and you're like, wait a minute, we're parasites were bad, bad people.

Speaker 2:          01:08:39       Yeah. I, I did this thing before my, a showtime special in 2005 or I talked about human beings being a really complicated form of bacteria. So, hey, you know, I've had this idea a few times while tripping and the inside tanks and even on planes, and I've had this feeling like if you looked at the earth as a life force and you look to human beings, you would, you would say, well, that's a growth. You would say, look, if it's, it's everywhere. It's, it's, it sucks all the fish out of the ocean, it throws waste in there and kills all the rest of the life. It fucks everything. It touches it everywhere it lives. There's brown smoke, you burned down giant chunks of it. It grows right back and even gets bigger. It's like this is some crazy growth. I'm like, if you didn't understand whom, if we, you were so alien that human beings were an identifiable as an individual, you would, you would look at them as a giant, huge swarm of life on top of this other life.

Speaker 2:          01:09:37       You wouldn't see individual people. You would see it just like mold and I said that maybe we're here to eat the sandwich. Maybe we are like moldy sandwich that maybe we're just a really super complicated thing that's here to fuck things up. That's why at the pinnacle of Technology, the the best we have to do is the shit that fucks things up the most. Like nuclear power, nuclear waste, you know, and and all sorts of other crazy experiments that are probably going on right now that we're not even aware of. Anti matter type shed. They were there working on anti-matter weapons and aunt in area 51 what does that mean? I don't even know. I don't, I don't even know, but it can't be good. It's like what? Nuclear power doesn't kill everybody quick enough. You fuckhead you need to develop something that kills everyone instantaneously. We have enough bombs to blow up the whole world, like how many times over? And they'll like, yeah, but it doesn't do it quite as good as I think can be done. So they continue to make nuttier and nuttier weapons. Do you see that? Uh, the jet drone, Dave, uh, developed the go something like 18 times faster than the speed of sound. Right? Some insane amount just to get over there and fuck things up as quick as possible.

Speaker 5:          01:10:44       We don't need any better weapons. That's, you know, we have, we have weapons that we don't even have the first clue about now.

Speaker 2:          01:10:50       Well, it's what I've, but we are nature as, as animals, as an intelligent animals is to keep trying to make things better. It's like if we stopped right now with cell phones and said, we good, we good with this. We can talk, we can taxed. This is good enough. Right? Can we just stop right there? It would. No one would take that. People would go crazy. Four years from now they'd be fucking so math or iPhone, this fucking clunky old hunk of shit. Why can't they have something better than this now? People would be angry. We, we have a deep desire for technological innovation. At the end of that is destruction at the very peak of technology. The best we're capable of is blowing shit up. It makes you wonder if that's really what we're here for. It makes you wonder if we are not some weird technological caterpillar becoming a butterfly and all of our desires and ego and the need to get pussy and drive a fast car.

Speaker 2:          01:11:39       All that shit really is just pushing the society and the society is pushing technology and technology. One day someone's going to press a fucking button and the whole thing. She said, now I'm not going to be so smiley anymore. Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be though. Well, my theory is, my theory is that that's a no, that that's, that's how the universe gets born and dies with us and that the Bang Bang. It's really just a bunch of scientists with autism on anti anxiety medication and they make a big bang machine and one of them presses it and the whole universe starts all over again. And it starts again with planets forming and then life forms. And then dinosaurs. Dinosaurs get hit by an asteroid billions of years ago by the whole deal. And then one guy presses a button and a big bang machine, he rigs boom and it starts all over again.

Speaker 2:          01:12:28       Why not if the unit, if it's possible for the University of the universe, that's possible too. It's possible that it's just a bunch of scientists with autism and every 14 billion years they blow the whole fucking thing sky high and it starts from scratch. Uh, well definitely. Uh, we're going to have to eat, drink and be marry them because we're all going to, that's what I'm talking about. What do you think when you talk to these people that are like, I mean for you, you are a realist. You're a dude who's seen the dark parts of the world. When you talk to people and they, you know, they start hitting you with some fucking power of positive thinking type shit and hit you with the secret or Eckhart toll and you know, he's like, do, do you want to like when that holds the secret thing was going on, do you want to say, listen, you, you're fucking environment is real.

Speaker 2:          01:13:09       Okay. You don't create it with your mind. It's real. There really are parts of the world that sock and positive thinking he's not going to get you out of Mogadishu. Right. Well we are in Pasadena. I mean like, you know, positive thinking. Got You here. Yeah. There you go. Uh, you know, New York tends to be a bit more cynical and la tends to be a bit more, so whether, whether I'm pretty girls, that's what it does. It for real and space space. Um, the fact that it's not, you don't get rained on hardly ever and it's never cold. Right. That's huge. That east coast winter thing is, that's bullshit. That's retarded. Everybody gets angry. Yeah. Your face hurts that she has no good. He get stuck on the highway. Every gets stuck on the highway. Yeah, the whole fucking highway shutdown black ice. That's always fun.

Speaker 2:          01:13:59       That shit doesn't happen here. It doesn't have in here at all. So people were more relaxed. It really is that plus the people that landed on the east coast, we're all animals who were so fucking fed up with Europe that they on boats to get on boats and they got them when across an ocean before there was TV. Okay. And they decided to move to this new country that they didn't ever probably even have good pictures of. You know, someone just told them is a land of plenty and they decided to get in a boat and give it a shot. Those people are psycho. I mean those are some really adventuresome fucking people.

Speaker 6:          01:14:31       Well those were the, those were the first ones. Those were all adventuresome. But the ones who said, okay, you're going to go up that way. We don't know how far it is and we don't really know if you're going to get there. And by the way, there's all kinds of tribes that are going to try to scalp you and rape your daughters and all this shit as you go through there. And there's mountains that are probably impassable and you're gonna have to eat your kids, go, go west. And, and, and it was, it was, when we say frontier, it was like the frontier was, we don't know what's, what's next. We don't know what's beyond there. And so for those people to say, I'm going to leave, I'm like a Irish fucking potato picker. And I lived in New York for three years and that was no good. So I'm going to go out and I'm just going to go out into fucking absolute wilderness where everyone hates me in the animals and want to eat me and I'm just going to keep going until I hit the other ocean. That's crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:15:21       And it's amazing how quick it happened. Yeah. It was just like being know a couple hundred years, a giant fucking swarm of millions of people had completely populated this one continent that before that, you know, the last time people came across here was the ice age. There wasn't really a lot of human beings live in the air when most people don't know is in North America. Just a little over 10,000 years ago, half of it was covered by a mile of ice. I mean, wrap your head around a mile of fucking ice above your head and that covered half this country. This is the, this country that we don't understand like the history of humanity in the world. We have a very, um, patchy, sort of a knowledge of everything past the Ice Age, everything about people 10,000 plus years ago. It's a lot of, there's some bullshit, there's a lot of bullshitting because there's a lot of information they're not willing to look at.

Speaker 2:          01:16:15       Some new stuff's coming along, new construction that they've found like in Turkey, this go Becky tap lead. It's at least 14,000 years old. Massive excellently cut stone columns, civilization, clear civilization back in a time where they're attributing all that area only as hunter and gatherers, there is no civilization, there's no cities. Where's the fucking city man you're going to, you got to explain this. Not only that, it has drawings up or um, statues that are carved into it. Like these three d images of animals that don't even exist in that area, that part of the world. So it's a, it's, it's real possible that shit. Like, you know, the ice being over half of this country that's moved around for tens of thousands of years and there's probably been these pretty kind of nifty sophisticated civilizations, but maybe they get to a point, not even as far as we've gotten right now, but maybe get to some previous point and just implode like those crazy ass holes in Pakistan or implode like Nazi Germany or, or implode like a million different examples from Gingiss Khan to, to, you know, to the Catholic Church, look at all the crazy shit that's gone on in this country.

Speaker 2:          01:17:23       This, yeah. It easily could be like that always. And that we've gotten to these really amazing Atlantean type civilizations and just fucking chaos. Boom. Somebody comes in strapped up, but Dynamo, who the fuck knows and just ace is the whole thing. There's one part of the world somewhere in the Middle East, I forget where it is, where there's um, they found glass in the desert. They found like this area in a satellite image, kind of wish I had more information about this from the tip of my tip of my tongue, but the, the, it was either some sort of an asteroid will impact, or like hundreds of thousands of years ago, somebody had a fucking gigantic explosion there, right? Like if it was like some sort of civilization and they flattened that motherfucker out, that's not outside the realm of possibility that someone figured out something, some sort of massive way to fuck things up, you know, that we're the only ones that have ever figured that out throughout history.

Speaker 2:          01:18:19       It's very possible that somebody else might have time when we might've done this whole dance to the top a couple of times before tumbling. You know, this is just the highest we've ever gotten. It kept it together very good at destroying shit, that's for sure. I've got this guy coming on June 7th for those of you who, uh, been asking me about this, uh, John Anthony West and uh, he's, uh, this egyptologist who is a famous for his work is uncovering the fact that there's not just one each option civilization that they're dealing with. You're dealing with old, older and older civilizations to go back to 30 plus thousand years. There's actual hieroglyphs that show that each option civilization goes back that far. Like they even named the pharaohs, but for some reason, modern day egyptologist have looked at all this stuff and said that, well, that's a myth.

Speaker 2:          01:19:05       Like everything was real up until about 5,000 years ago and all the rest of that stuff is just, they just made that shit up because it doesn't, it doesn't coincide with our own ideas of how long civilization has been around for, you know, it just seems to me that when you look at how sophisticated we are today and how close we are to fucking it up and how badly it is fucking up and all the places in the world that you described, it seems like the odds that we haven't done this already, like it just seems really small and I think we've got a lot of Amnesia when it comes to the past of, of, of humans. And I think you also have to factor and physical things that we can't control like the earth volcanoes, earthquakes, sh asteroidal impacts shit like that. You know, when I'm driving here today, I was driving on the the one 18 and it's beautiful.

Speaker 2:          01:19:49       You're going through the hills, the mountains and I'm looking up and I'm just saying it is amazing that we are basically in the whole world is a convertible, right? There's no top and we're just, we just sort of accepted that we're just head to the universe, just nothing but space and fucking giant rocks can fall from the sky and crush your country. And we've just sort of completely forgotten about that. I mean there's, there's impact holes that you can visit. I mean, if you look at the general life of the university, you know, the university being billions of years old right now, look at all the holes on earth and then you just think, how long have we been around? 4.6 billion years. How many holes are there? This is going to happen again. You motherfucker this, we're forgetting that this shit happens. Like there's hundreds of thousands of them.

Speaker 2:          01:20:37       You know, there is biggest states and they're flying through the air and they're going to land and they're gonna fuck up everything there. You're really depressing me. You could throw that. No, it's not bad, man. I think, I think if that's, if we're going to go, that's, that's a fucking amazing way to go. That's going to be quick. It's going to be quick and it's going to be crazy. And you don't have to worry about anybody suffering. You know, it's like we're not afraid to sleep and everybody's afraid to die and both of them are inevitable. It's going to happen. You're going to die on it. It's not like we're going to live forever. If he asked her, it doesn't come, we're going to die. For sure. That might be a crazy way to do it. I'm not saying it's not saying it's good, but might not be bad. It might be the way it has to happen for the next ultra intelligent thing to come along. That wouldn't have existed before. The dinosaurs wouldn't have existed before us. I mean, that makes sense.

Speaker 5:          01:21:23       I'd rather go out by an asteroid then a series of sort of dirty bombs by some sort of cult or religious terrorism.

Speaker 2:          01:21:33       Did you see the latest footage from Syria? All the murdered children?

Speaker 5:          01:21:36       Yeah. What the fuck is going on over there? Well, it's the same thing. You know, that that happened in Libya. It's the same thing. You know, that might happen in Egypt. Um, you know when people fight, it's the years you, you know what you said about Vietnam, don't they remember Vietnam? And you know when you go to these places and you see what injuries look like, which are colostomy bags and you know, legs that are gone and our arms are gone. You say, well you know, why would you ever do this again? And then you know, generation forgets and then they go do something else. Like go, just go do it again.

Speaker 2:          01:22:13       How do we, how do we stop the cycle? Is it possible without mushrooms? I don't think so. I think it's what I'm thinking. Asked for a tap

Speaker 5:          01:22:20       doing asteroids. I'd rather have the asteroids to do it though.

Speaker 2:          01:22:24       We know the concept of asteroids coming from machines. No, excuse me. Mushrooms coming from asteroids, asteroids coming from Russia. Maybe the world comes from mushrooms. Maybe getting to be a really trippy, well this is a from Mckenna. Mckenna is theory. Well Panspermia is a real theory of life right now. The theory that amino acids and certain nutrients and things and water in fact comes from comets and asteroids and that life is transferred from planet to planet by Asteroidal impacts. This is a legit scientific theory. Well, Mckenna's theory about silicide been was that suicide, but it's completely alien to any other form of life that we have here on earth. There's nothing like it biologically are biochemically, it's, I think it's, I'm not, I'm not saying exactly right, but I believe it's like four Fox for all. Oxi Nn dimethyltryptamine. It mimics the human neurotransmitter dimethyl trip team, which is a potent psychedelic drug.

Speaker 2:          01:23:16       It mimics that, but it also has like phosphorus and the four position, which apparently no other, no, no other compound on earth does. And the idea is that spores can exist in a vacuum and that spores could easily have traveled through the vacuum and the radiation of space and landed from another planet here, created this life form that wants you to eat it so it pops up and looks like a dinner plate and it pops up all over the place. Everywhere you go. It's not hiding it all. And karmic. It's literally at the bottom of the food chain. It lives on shit. It's just a humble little thing that wants you to come along and eat it. And when you eat it, you're granted spectacular visions, spectacular visions and feelings of love and God and unity and the thoughts of the universe being entirely connected in one big mathematical equation, computations and cells and organisms and fucking all the way down to atoms and subatomic particles and then branching out again.

Speaker 2:          01:24:09       And all this shit comes from something that grows out of shit. All this shit comes from something that comes from space. And the idea is that our, our concept of life and our concept of intelligent is very narrow. And we egocentrically have assumed that all intelligence must be contained inside a brain in some sort of an intelligent upright body that we can respect, that's going to come here from another planet and show us how to use a laser gun. You know? But in fact, intelligence can exist in plant form and that intelligence in, in, in spectacular visions and, and knowledge all comes out of a dimension that you cannot access without these molecules that exist in these plants. And it opens literally chemical doorways and the mind. It's pretty fascinating idea. The fact that, you know, that is alien invasion, that mushrooms are an alien invasion.

Speaker 2:          01:25:00       I got to read this. Who's MCKENNA? Terence Mckenna. He's a w who is a crazy psychedelic chemist. Slash botanist. Slash. Uh, I think his degrees, we're all in ethnobotany. And his, I think his main study of work was the concept of the stoned ape theory, um, that and his idea of TimeWave zero, which would, the idea was that time was like a mathematical progression of waves and that like a novelty and terrible times would all just, they were all almost be predictable that you could, it was some sort of a mathematical equation or getting to infinite novelty, which was like in this year supposedly, really, which is probably horse shit. But, uh, his other, the fascinating theory was the mushroom theory, the stoned ape theory. And that was the theory that that's how human beings actually evolved from lower primates was the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and his theory, actually, I don't know if it's been supported by a lot of different scientists. I know there's some debate on whether or not as timelines are right, but it's a, based on the idea that

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       a bunch of monkeys ate some mushrooms and then help them evolve.

Speaker 6:          01:26:07       It's interesting how many theories there are about how he got from sort of that to this.

Speaker 1:          01:26:13       Yeah. Well, it's crazy. You look at it, we go to visit them in the zoo. I took my kids to the zoo the other day and I'm staring at my cousin's sure. In a cage.

Speaker 6:          01:26:20       Well here in the home of Scientology, you know, they believe that the aliens came and went into the monkeys and that's what we are. We're just vessels for alien souls.

Speaker 1:          01:26:30       Well, that's the sexiest idea. Sexiest idea is the auto knocky stuff. You know the stuff that we were created by aliens and we were a genetic engineering program and you know, you look at like stuff on the Sumerian texts from like 6,000 years ago that depicts the Annunaki coming here. And how do you not know that that's not science fiction? Maybe that's like their version of a sure outer space or the outer limits or something like that. Well it's, it's, it's insane how many people are like this was, this was how it happened. It's aliens, mushrooms, it's this, it's that. Well, the weird thing is the doubling of the human brain size. I don't know what the fuck happened, man. I think it's probably a lack of information more than it is a, I think it can't just be mushrooms that we did. We did.

Speaker 1:          01:27:15       That would be amazing. If it was like, oh you have to do is eat mushrooms, your brain would just grow. But we just got on mushrooms within a hundred years we'd look like those gray aliens. Just giant heads. We would need any muscles because we would use our minds to control matter. And we'd just be moving shit around constantly with our minds. I feel mushroom trip coming onto you think so. I think I'm ready to do it today. Or you got that. Um, you've got one over here, man. You want a cigarette? Um, that's going to fix today. I was thinking how much I love you. I hate cigarettes and I'm handing him, I'm like, I just want you to like me. I just want you to be happy. Shane 11 to you're, you're, you're blowing my mind today. A lot of people on my mind, always, a lot of people have been passing around this, uh, speech that you gave at Africa. It was some conference lately where you were talking about the future of television. Can you explain it? Because I haven't actually watched it yet, but I'm interested in what you yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:28:14       Um, it was a speech, uh, for Internet week about, you know, everyone's online versus versus cable. And you know, what I was saying was, so I didn't know what to do. I didn't have uh, uh, anything plan that was very smart. So I, I was flying back actually from Afghanistan, no, it's finding back from Afghanistan and I ducked into Pakistan to see the garage. He shoots, it was flying back from Pakistan and I was thinking about all the kids that I had seen who are going insane and who were, you know, the guys who would kill for 10 bucks and this is fucking crazy fucking dudes. And I was like, look, the youth everywhere in, in, in Asia and Africa and Europe here, everyone's fucking revolting. But what, what we making like, so when I went to do the upfront, which is where all the TV shows get sold and online shows get sold and you have like, the voice was just, which is the biggest show, which is just American idol.

Speaker 6:          01:29:11       It now TV is derivative of TV. TV is just making shittier and shittier shows based on itself. And then the on the Internet, which could be this, it could be revolutionary because it's better because you can be watching something, been text somebody and then get information than Google this and fucking what's it going on here and here. And instead of trying to be and say what the fuck is going on. And by the way, young people are revolting all around the world and they want the, this is how they get their news now. They get it through blogs and online shit here and there. They don't even watch TV anymore. But instead of doing something innovative and challenging and revolutionary, we just do shittier versions of TV shows with half the budgets. And so it's, the city sort of Google says, you know what really pisses me off is Dah, Dah, Dah.

Speaker 6:          01:29:53       It's like America's funniest home videos with a, with a sort of annoying host. And you're like, why don't we, why don't we use the internet? Why don't we use, you know, the, the, the social networks and you know, video and all this stuff we can do now to actually do something that's good and revolutionary and start changing shit. Because when he asks and says, well, how do we fucking stop all this shit? Well, the first way you stop about it is it stop. It is to find out about it. So we have to know about it and then we know about it. And then we can do shit. Like we can not buy certain things, you know, dollar advocacy. You know, consumer advocacy is the most powerful tools we have, et Cetera, et cetera. But the first of all is knowing about it. And, and so I just sort of got really pissed off that the Internet has become so derivative and so shitty and just trying to mimic TV interviews shit. So let's try to fucking make something that actually people understand where the people, like whether people use that helps people or, or, or, or they understand of shit. Like, for example, like Kony 2012 you're like, what's it shows that it's viral shows that people actually want to know this shit and shows it. But like it was, it was okay. Like it was this sort of half ass.

Speaker 2:          01:30:59       What did you think about that whole situation? I mean that, that is another example of one of the reasons why I believe that life is a work of fiction. A fucking guy decides that he's going to make this viral video against James Kone

Speaker 6:          01:31:12       whack, whack, whack in it. Oh,

Speaker 2:          01:31:14       is that his name's Charles. Connie James [inaudible]. He's going to make this viral video, expose the world to this horrible person, but they're getting a disproportionate amount of the money goes to them and then they get accused of being unscrupulous, whatever the words would use to, they didn't do anything illegal. They just did. They're a little funky with the money. Then the guy shows up naked in the streets, beating off acting gang. Did you see in the video?

Speaker 6:          01:31:39       Yeah. Uh, that's like craziness. Like, well, they didn't, I'm sure they didn't think they went through these kids that go over and they shot it Fairfox to him. You know, I've been there. It's a bad part of the world. And, and you know what, it's interesting on a few points. One because it shows that the fucking like everyone, kids don't care. People don't care about anything outside of America. Like it's a big in media that I would say don't do anything outside of America. People just don't give a shit about it. Well I think it shows that people do give a shit about it and, and these guys weren't expecting it. That become a huge thing and you know, so obviously when weird shit happens to you, you have different ways of coping. The Sky Cope by going fucking

Speaker 1:          01:32:22       go see, which actually seems appealing sometimes. Like when life's really hard, you're just say, I'm going to take off my fucking clothes. There's fucking serial killers and assassins everywhere. I've just, I'm going to get your flashlight. Fucking that guy was

Speaker 2:          01:32:39       on the street in his underwear. He got naked. He was like a flailing his arms around it. And acting like Super Gay. Yes. I wonder what he was on. What makes the act gay besides being

Speaker 1:          01:32:54       yeah, mostly Cox balls, booty hoes, red band flashlights. What is a well, yeah, Cody. I mean the thing is, is it,

Speaker 6:          01:33:04       it became huge and I think it shows that there's a massive audience anyway. So it was possible. Yeah. And the whole thing is, is let's make shit that actually isn't shit. Let's make stuff that, you know, uh, is telling the stories. And so that's what we're doing. And I said, you know, look, if, if it's vice who's doing it, then we're really in fucking trouble because I didn't come up with any sort of save the World Cup.

Speaker 2:          01:33:25       Yeah. But you're not compromised yet. And as a human being, when you gotten to the point where you see this information, you're not compromised. So you're releasing it and you're focusing on it and you have an honest died for what?

Speaker 6:          01:33:35       Well, it's also when we went around the world and expanded the company, you just see all this shit happening and you're like, what the fuck? Why isn't anybody fucking saying this shit? And then, but, but I always say that, look, if we're, if we're a new source, then it's the world's in trouble because we were a style mag, you know, we all, we gave a shit about what's fucking, you know, famously say, you know, cocaine, supermodels, rare denim and sneakers. And then when you go around the rest of the world, you're like, holy fucking shit. And you sort of, you know, come out of the pond and go, okay, well we gotta do something.

Speaker 1:          01:34:03       Well, I think that's probably, they're here to get you. You got enough. I think,

Speaker 2:          01:34:09       you know, the only way journalists ever become journalists in the first place, they feel they have something that they feel needs to be sad, right? They have this desire to, to send a message. And that comes from seeing things that are wrong. Seeing things that need to be reported on, things that you know, and, and it turned you into a journalist. I mean, essentially the reality of the world turned you into a journalist and you're the perfect example of what a journal is should be because you're not compromised because you can do these stories and you can, you can, I mean, if you had someone overseeing you, someone from NBC or CBS, do you, what do you think you could've gotten any of this stuff done?

Speaker 6:          01:34:44       Well,

Speaker 1:          01:34:46       if you said to them, Hey, I'm going to go to Pakistan and I'm gonna meet with the Taliban, I don't think, yeah, we wouldn't be allowed to, to do

Speaker 6:          01:34:52       a lot of this stuff that we do because we just, we just go in and get permits. You guys just go, don't generally don't get permits. You asked for the people, if you could put them in a movie on television, the people that they sign anything, they signed things. But people generally want to tell their stories. But I mean ask government permission or police permission or all you know, the things you're supposed to or also, um, you're generally supposed to go with security teams and we're like what do I did a security team wants, cause we were doing a show with MTV and um, they made us get one in Beirut and I'd been to Beirut like 20 times if they were, it's not that bad sometimes and parts of it are bad, but, and, and we were walking target cause you just have all these dudes like talking.

Speaker 6:          01:35:37       And so I said I'm never going to have security ever again because that's the sure way that you're not going to get a story or the real people aren't going to talk to you or everyone's going to think what, who are the fuck these guys? So we go and you just, you just, we call it immersion as them, you just go immerse yourself, you know, in, in, in the place. And then just, you know, press record, don't go in with any sort of preconceived ideas or notions or political paradigms or I'm going to prove this because generally you're not going to prove that. Like for example, if you went to Somalia and said, I'm going to prove that these guys are barbarians pirates and you know, then you're going to shut yourself off to exactly what you said, which is, well actually we illegally irradiated their whole coast and illegally over fished it so that there are starving and they're like, well, we're going to tax the, the people who did this to it.

Speaker 2:          01:36:22       Yeah. They're called the people's coast guard. That with voluntary coast guard of Somalia, they call themselves. Yeah. What the fuck man, dude, if anybody knows how to fix this, it's, you know, you see it all. I think it's the Internet. Yeah. Well he's the only hope we have the Internet and technology. The technology, like what you were saying about pulling carbon out of the atmosphere and cleaning the air and reusing the fuel they're using. That makes sense. I mean, if technology can put it out there, it seems like, you know, we should be able to harvest it. Maybe not now, maybe a hundred years from now, whenever the fuck it actually becomes viable.

Speaker 6:          01:36:53       Well, somebody asked me at Internet week, the guy said, well, what if I'm not angry? You know, I'm whatever, 22 and I'm not angry and I want to go get an Mba and make money. And I said, great. You know, I think that that there was the sort of our grandparent's generation that, that, you know, were, they didn't know better. So they were like, oh, space, age, food, you know, the TV dinners and produce all the food. Let's make it all with computers or whatever. Not Assembly lines. And so it started to be bad for us, you know, and started to, you know, all these things, Agent Orange, let's, you know, do all these terrible things. But they didn't know any better. The technology was sort of their savior. But the baby boomers, you know, they were the first generation that knew better but still became the largest energy consumers, the largest garbage producers, all this thing. Gen X has sort of slipped by. But guess what, the bills here and it's going to be Gen y like they have to pay. There is no, there is no get out of jail free card now. So as you're seeing economically and socially and culturally and politically that we're shifting and if you, if you just want to sort of say, I'm going to stick my head in the sand, which we've done for a little while, I don't think you're going to be able to anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:38:10       I agree with you. And I agree that with that things are shifting. And I also think that that's why these, uh, attacks on the constitution had been permitted in and are being pushed through. I think they've, uh, they've seen the prognosis and they've seen the future and the future is the trends that we see on the Internet. And it's a trend towards a more libertarian line of thinking. It's a trend towards a smaller government, more accountability, less bureaucracy. The idea of creating jobs doesn't mean you create some new fucking laws that you'd have to saddle everybody with and a bunch of people to enforce those laws. And that's what they, a lot of these politicians like to think of as creating jobs. You know, it's not, gee, you're creating problems and you constantly keep attacking the constitution and pulling amendments apart and, and really defacing the whole idea what this country was founded on. They're doing it just because they sensed the future and the future is not, it's not, it's not going to work the way it works now. It's just not, we're not going to deal with this whole idea of representative government and we're not going to deal with special interest groups. That shit is nonsense. That's gotta go away. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:39:08       I think if you look at, at what's happening too is if you look at Syria, for example, if you look at, at what happened in Egypt or, or Libya, you know, I spent a lot of time in those countries just before the revolution. I got arrested and in Libya. And then when I went back, you know, and I said it, you know, I would have never called this, you know, not a lot of people did. I would've, I would've said the opposite because it was so restrictive and it was so hardcore and everyone was so pro regime. But because of the Internet, because of Twitter, because of Facebook resolve these social tools, you had all these young people able to communicate and say, actually I'm pissed off too. Oh you're, oh, we're all fucking pissed off. Hey, let's change. And I think that you know that that change isn't going to be pretty in a lot of cases and it's going to be problematic.

Speaker 6:          01:39:56       But you do have young people who are taking up arms and now you also have young people who were just smashing the shit out of cities like they did in Paris and especially in London last summer. But you know what happens when, when you know, occupy Wall Street becomes Egypt, you know, to try to smash the status quo. What happens when occupy Wall Street becomes Syria or it becomes Olivia and you know, it's, it's not in the foreseeable future maybe, but I couldn't, I didn't call Libya or Egypt or Syria either. You know, there's a lot, a lot of, of, of unrest out there and there's a lot of people communicating that unrest. And in fact, if you see that in America, it's growing and that if I was, uh, you know, campaigning this summer, then I would be focusing on, oh, we have a huge fucking groundswell and a global groundswell of dissatisfaction with the only group that's actually going to get off their ass and do something about it.

Speaker 2:          01:40:53       You must have

Speaker 6:          01:40:54       at least some emotional attachment to Julian massage and the wikileaks case. Um, when you see this, uh, this case and is Bradley Manning Kid this, this, uh, who's, I believe it's still in solitary confinement. Yeah. Um, I don't even know if he, does he have a court date? I mean, I dunno, but, uh, they just lock this kid in a box, cut him off from humans until he's got, I'm sure he's completely crazy at this point. I don't think you can not go crazy in solitary confinement for five years. Yeah. Well it just shows that conspiracy theorists aren't crazy. You're not crazy at all. The majority of, of of these are, are, are proof that there are, you know, very sorted and unseemly things going on every day.

Speaker 2:          01:41:38       100%. And the, the information that that guy released alone makes him a hero. That guy release things that are anti American. He released things that are their war crimes. He saw war crimes. We're not war criminals or Americas where American, this is how I'm most proud Americans feel we're American and we're not cunt. That's it. We don't take any bullshit, but we're not cuts that, that's when you get a guy who feels that and he's an American and he's a soldier and he wants to, you know, look, he's a voluntary soldier, signed up to represent this government and he sees his government doing horrible shit that's not being reported. It's being covered up. Covering shit up when you do crimes is not how crimes get resolved. What's it not? When did tell him the truth and and um, keeping governments and big business and check become anti America.

Speaker 2:          01:42:22       The guy's a goddamn patriot patriot and he's locked in a box and then Julia Sanje gets in trouble. This wiki leaks thing is so fascinating, man. People were accusing me of getting my information wrong, but no, he's in jail. He's not even accused of rape. He's accused of having sex without a condom. I wasn't lying. He apparently, you know, they were sleeping together and he stuck it in this chick. I don't know. I don't know the fucking full story, but the bottom line is that's why they're trying to export this guy. Like if that's not the craziest thing, you were going to regulate voluntary sexual, it'd be two people are naked in bed. We're going to decide what didn't, didn't happen between a guy and a girl and you're going to spend that much fucking money to monitor this guy and make sure he checks in constantly. And this is what he's put videos online of his, his daily routine. He has to drive to the police station and check in before he can do things. He, it's under house arrest. The whole thing is madness.

Speaker 6:          01:43:12       Well the thing is is the fact that they keep going on on the story and saying, yeah, we don't want them for actually blowing the whistle on every crime that's been going on in the government. We want them for this sort of weird, you know, quasi thing that happened in Sweden that wouldn't be considered anything anywhere else.

Speaker 2:          01:43:31       Well yeah. What did I think someone described it as surprise sex. Like that's not it. It's not even rape. Technically it's like they had had consensual sex with a condom and then they were lying in bed. I don't know. The fuck really happened, so I shouldn't even be saying this, but the idea that they're, they're wasting so much resource on a sexual issue, that's even a violent one. Not even rape,

Speaker 6:          01:43:53       but it's kind of smart actually because it's, for example, it's, you know, it's the one thing that you, you know, you can't say, well they just drummed it up and it's bullshit. And another, because yeah, well rape is very serious. It's the worst of the worst. So you're in, you're in a catch 22 of saying, well they just drummed it up to get this guy for blowing the whistle. But yet at the same time they drummed up the one thing that you're sort of taboo to go again.

Speaker 2:          01:44:16       It's the number one thing. Yeah. And, but they didn't, they couldn't even get a good version of it. I mean, no, the story is so weak. If it was, you know, he roof her and he did this and he tied her up and took pictures and we have the pictures. Oh well the guy's obviously a con that released important information.

Speaker 6:          01:44:31       But I think the sad thing about it is that you look at, you know, deep throat, you know, who you know, just announced to he was and all this stuff and he did it just to save the government. And all that stuff. He's a hero. Right? Right. And, and

Speaker 2:          01:44:45       well, it depends on who won. You know, Bradley Manning could come out to be a hero. Julian Assange's can come out to be a hero if there was some crazy revolution in the future. You know, we realize that this is where the turning point of American society, when they said, we're not going to take this bullshit anymore. When they watch that collateral murder video and realize who do, what are we doing to our children? We're forcing them to even think like that. So this is it. This is acceptable. This is if this one shot at life and this is how you're going to spend some of your time shooting missiles down and innocent people wandering through the street.

Speaker 6:          01:45:12       Well, what my question is, when did it change from journalism and the fourth estate? It's job being to make sure that politicians weren't lying to make sure the corporations weren't doing these bad things and want to gate changed it. Right. Well, I think actually distribution I think changes it because for companies run all news media and they're all major global corporations at all have huge advertising. And so they're conflicted and they don't go after politicians. And I remember during the the Iraq war, you know, people knew that there were, you know, that this was all a construct. They knew that there weren't more weapons of mass destruction. They knew that everyone was used to joke. I used to hang out with other journalists and they'd say, of course, I mean alcaide is, is the opposite of, of the bath party.

Speaker 2:          01:46:02       How far do you take that? How far do you take the whole idea of conspiracy?

Speaker 6:          01:46:09       I Dunno if it's, it's, it's, it's certainly a conspiracy I think. Yeah, for sure. But that's been admitted to now. And, and I think that the, the, the, because of nine 11 the Prescott co-opted and it became an American to say anything bad about the government or the military. And I think that that is, that is, was one of the sort of turning points, a, because that's bullshit. And B, because young people got completely disenfranchised by the news media because we saw it all happens. You say, wait a minute, this doesn't sound right. And then afterwards they're like, yeah, there was no weapons of mass destruction. Yeah, there was no car of here. And you're like, well, but we knew that, but we kept saying it. The news media became part of a government propaganda program and everybody just went along with it. And that's fucking scary because no matter who's in government, you know, if they can just put together a propaganda, how is that different than, you know, than Nazi Germany? How is it that different than, than any of these totalitarian regimes where they say, yes, you know, uh, you know, Camille Song is God or whatever. Like how is that any different? Because you can use the fourth estate as you. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:47:23       Pr Agency. Well, there was, we, CIA released some sort of a state and right after the war with Iraq and started that, they were going to start releasing fake stories to throw off the enemy. And once, once he admitted to doing something like that, that's it. Incredibly slippery ground. Like that's the only way to defeat the enemy as you have to put out fake stories and lie to everyone and we're supposed to give you that power. Like what kind of checks and balances are in place before that stuff gets distributed? What do you know what the fuck is going on here?

Speaker 6:          01:47:52       Well it's also, you know, Memorial Day and you said it exactly right is that, you know, what are we doing sending, you know, going in with what's our mission to go into Afghanistan, what's our mission and what we haven't mentioned? Okay, that Taliban, Taliban, Taliban, okay, now we're letting the Taliban in because well we've lost. We're saying, okay, well we have to have power sharing with them. And so you say, well everybody knows it's going to go right back to civil war. So you're like, well why did we come here? Why did we do all this? Like what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          01:48:23       So you don't think that it's some sort of a grand conspiracy to extract minerals and all that stuff. You think it's much more of a cluster fuck shit decision by government and then being in place because of momentum and because of the fact there's contractors and they all want to keep getting paid.

Speaker 6:          01:48:37       Resource Wealth for sure. And it was the, it was the story that, you know, we broke in Sudan that time, you know, Darra for as oil and resource wealth. You know, we did it in the Congo, we've done it in a lot of stories all over the place. I wouldn't say I would say they got caught in the quagmire of Afghanistan, much like the Soviets did. They went in there, they were trying to do something and they just got sucked in and then it got worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and look it guts. It's so bad on every level. I mean America is in there trying to fight this war on drugs, war on drugs, war on drugs. They've been in there 12 years. There's never been more heroin for cheaper or higher quality ever. In fact, it's so good that they put the golden triangle out of business. It's all coming from Afghanistan. And so America is the biggest drug dealer in the world because we're just sitting there running this country that just ships out all the heroin

Speaker 2:          01:49:24       in the world. How much of a piece does the CIA have of that?

Speaker 6:          01:49:27       Who knows? I would say that, you know, look at, it's been documented that they were part of the original, uh, outflux into America from Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Um, as a way to keep urban populations sort of at bay. Um, that's,

Speaker 2:          01:49:44       that was like a real social experiment. They would bring heroin into the ghetto to real. That's, that's, that's well documented. Yeah. But is it well documented the intentions?

Speaker 6:          01:49:55       Yeah, because there was civil unrest in the major urban center, so they, they allowed heroin to go in because it took away all sort of, well, everything comes up. Heroin Addiction. So I mean, if it's been a part of their policy in the past, obviously they're going to be incredibly sensitive to it. But I don't think that you can say that they're not involved or at least the State Department is not involved because the, uh, statistics speak for themselves. There's two times more by a factor of two, so 100% more heroin addiction. Heroin addicts in America since the start of the Afghani war and heroin's never been cheaper. It's never been better quality and we've been running it so like it's, it's just flooding out to destroy the, you know Russia is now, I've got 7% in Pakistan, which is a Muslim country. Extremist Muslim country has something like 12% in, in Karachi anyway, a heroin addiction and it's just, it's flooding out of Afghanistan and that's we, we have gone in and taken all the fields that we didn't,

Speaker 2:          01:50:59       well not only did we not take the fields now we guarded them. Syria. Yeah, definitely. Most people want to come up with some sort of crazy explanation or excuse for why they did that. It's because

Speaker 6:          01:51:10       fear that they're going to, it's the only way they're really making money. They're making money two ways, which is the American government and, and heroin. And so they're like, well if we really, if we take away the heroin production, then they're really going to hate us.

Speaker 2:          01:51:22       Do they, does any of that stuff make its way in pharmaceutical grade? Uh, opiates like oxycodone, things along those lines.

Speaker 6:          01:51:28       Zero knows. I don't know. I all I know is like every time we do a story on the heroin, uh, situation in Afghanistan is fucking shocking because you're just like the Americans let them and there's actually, you know, pictures of American troops guarding poppy

Speaker 2:          01:51:41       to this is the war on drugs sort of except over there, over there were a war against the war on drugs.

Speaker 6:          01:51:51       Do you see the war on drugs in Afghanistan? And then you see the war on drugs in Mexico. You're like, wow. Well it's completely corrupt from start to finish. There is this war on drugs is completely,

Speaker 2:          01:52:02       what's the craziest slippery war ever when you use the war on drugs and then you have armed fold soldiers, gardening, hobby fields, what side are you on? And this war on drugs, cause it seems like you're on the pro drug side, you're guarding the drugs. Like, how could you have a war on drugs when you're carting, they dry and you're sending all the weapons to Mexico and they need and all the money and you don't even go to jail for it. And 90 what was the amount? 90% plus of the heroin comes out of Afghanistan. And what did you say about how much would, how much is the percentage of an increase? Since we have occupied

Speaker 6:          01:52:39       just in America it's doubled, but that's just in America. But in, in, in Russia it's gone through the roof. It's the doubled in UK, but Russia and Pakistan in the Middle East, countries like Iran, everywhere on the path has just heroin addictions or has soared. In fact, heroin addiction is so huge. And Russia, did you see the thing we did on Crockett

Speaker 2:          01:53:01       fuck man

Speaker 6:          01:53:04       to, to heroin, that if they then when they can't get it or because it got expensive now because so many people are buying it that they make their own synthetic heroin and uh, and it's called Krokodil because it makes you look like a crocodile because it makes your skin like scales. And then the scales fall off and you just have like bone there.

Speaker 2:          01:53:22       It's insane. If you haven't seen it, if you haven't seen the images online of people that are addicted, that have that, it's incredible. It's so frightening. It's frightening. It's so frightening that people would do that to themselves.

Speaker 6:          01:53:34       Literally shoot drugs that make my skin rot and fall off the bone.

Speaker 2:          01:53:39       He's not exaggerating. There's like people with big, their arms have like big gaping. See the bone, you see the bone and they can walk around. They're not even infected. Well, some of it, yeah, some of them get infected. It was weird. It looked like, like it was burnt off, like it was like fused kills all the flesh and it falls off Christ. That's insane. And what happens then? They just die. I mean, you can't just have your bones just exposed like that. Right. Does it ever fill up if you quit?

Speaker 6:          01:54:06       No. I don't know the answer. Does anybody ever get off that shit? It's, it's even more addictive than heroin. So

Speaker 2:          01:54:16       that you guys had that shit about the Colombian drug that you're blowing people's faces. Yeah. That is terrifying. Whether the free freaky

Speaker 6:          01:54:23       thing about Skubala mean is you don't believe it's true until you see it. Because the stories are, it's the Zombie drug, right? And it's, we heard stories of, you know, people coming into their apartments on the security cameras and like clearing out their whole apartments and you'd see them on security cams doing it, you know, and, and they don't have any recollection. They wake up in the morning, their bank accounts are drained, et Cetera, et cetera. And they couldn't figure it out until they, the FARC, the guys who were Colombians who are making a cocaine, we're using the same process to refine born Dango flowers to makes cupola mean. And what was happening with generally, it started out as hookers and hookers would put a condom inside their mouth right there. So we can go down and then they put a little sick Apollo mean in their lips.

Speaker 6:          01:55:10       And then when they go to like kiss you whenever they go and they would spit because Coppola Peter the, you inhale it and then you think you go, Holy Shit, that's scary. And then you go into this trance like state and then it's auto suggestion. So you, you say, okay, we're going to go down to your apartment. Yes. And we're going to go to the apartment and then we're going to clean out all your shit and we're going to go to your bank and we're going to, and they have security footage of them going to the bank and signing shit. And it's not like one or two people. This is like happens all the fuck. Oh my God. And so, uh, it's it, that's a fucking terrifying drug. Terrifying. Cause you're just gone, you're in a sort of Zombie like narcotic state and you just do what people tell you to.

Speaker 2:          01:55:49       That's the real ultimate date rape drug. Yeah. That's the real shit. So we gotta make sure people don't get ahold of that. That's a life rate dating one of those girls. Oh my God. Someone spit something in your mouth. Either Zombie, those girls have to be on date ago. There's no way you can date that guy. What a girl that would do that to somebody. Like, if you knew that's what she did as a job and then you ever got in a fight with, I get all these tricks. She was a hooker. I know. Imagine dating one of those hooker girls. That's just me. I'm silly though. Especially ones that take over your brains. Absolutely. Shit like that. Why would that exist? Why would there be something that allows you to be turned into a fucking Zombie to someone else's suggestions like that? You know, when you see the different things in nature, like different parasites to control different organisms and make them do fucked up things. And it really is kind of bizarre when you stop and think about it. I'm like, what kind of a system? What kind of a world that we live in where there's like, there's that land around a plant plant that grows and if he gets into your body, people just already around you don't have, that's crazy. You become a fucking robot. You become an automated little slave for them.

Speaker 6:          01:56:58       Drugs or drugs are crazy. We just did a story on, you probably know a lot more about it than I do, but uh, I have a game of yeah. And we were doing a story on the underground heroin clinics where, you know, people, uh, like it's actually started by a lot of ex junkies who were like 40 year junkies. I couldn't get off, tried, you know, hundreds of times to get cleaned and they would do, I have a game and then it interrupts your addiction, you know, for like two weeks or whatever. So it's long enough that you sort of get a, you know, you don't have to go cold Turkey. And uh, so we went to these clinics where they administer, I began and stuff. It was fucking fascinating. It was crazy. Did you do it? No, because I saw them do it and it's, they, they, they were taking massive doses so they were there taking like 48 hours. Lots of vomiting like

Speaker 2:          01:57:47       crazy. If I have a couple of friends that have done in one that did it recently in one that it changed his whole life. I have a buddy of mine, he got his back on injured, got hooked on pain pills, right. Pain, pain pills started, uh, taking, you know, the Nate, you name him. He was taking them and he couldn't get off them. How's it was ruining his life. Goes Down, gets an IB game, boom. Clean hundred percent. Now brings people down there, started his own center down there, brings people down there to uh, to introduce them to Mexico. But I'm like a fucking Mexico man. Mexico. Scary as fuck. Well, they, it's because it's still legal there. It's illegal here. It's a schedule one drug. Just like heroin. Well, everything in Mexico is decriminalized now. Right? They di Di. Most people don't know. They didn't, they decriminalized acid, mushrooms, pot coke, everything to fight the cartels. Correct. Exactly.

Speaker 6:          01:58:33       But yeah, I have a game that's the, yeah, that's the strongest drug I've ever seen. Like, because people under it, we're like, holy fuck. Yeah, my business partner.

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       Did it change his life? Well, he's just done a couple of times. He's done a couple of different things, right? It changes lives. Done. Iowasca know I began, he's really into going to these weird places and going on big trips.

Speaker 5:          01:58:53       But the Ibogaine is, is interesting cause we follow some junky straight through the whole process and it was pretty remarkable because it work. Like, yeah, it's nuts.

Speaker 2:          01:59:05       Yeah. Um, oh, I'll bring my friend who's done it. He, uh, you know, he described the process and I didn't want to do it even slightly. It sounded like hell yeah. Like, you know, you can, you can talk me into doing some DMT. Maybe it's 15 minutes and I'll send you

Speaker 5:          01:59:20       the piece. There's so much vomiting. It's fucking crazy. Days of vomiting

Speaker 2:          01:59:24       that cannot be good for you. Well, you gotta think don't matter if someone's hooked on heroin, anything, they'll take anything to get them out of that. I've watched people slip into addiction several times in my life and it's, it's just like being turned by a vampire. It really is. It's a feeling that you've lost someone there. They're slipping away, they're slipping away from themselves, from their family, from everybody. They're slipping away because of a compound, some sort of a chemical. It's really what a bizarre thing that we have. This, this, this addiction quality, you know, always say something.

Speaker 5:          01:59:55       The piece we say that this mother gives her son to these sort of New York fruit cakes. Nice guys. But like weird guys who do sort of west African Voodoo, uh, you know, when they, when they administer the Ibogaine and we were taking your son to Mexico, to one of these clinics because we couldn't legally do it in America. So he brought the whole crew down to Mexico to shoot it. And it was like, how bad is heroin that a mother is going to give her son to these, you know, crazy west African Voodoo shonky dudes to take off to Mexico and administer the strongest drug in the world too. So he's going to puke and fucking go nuts for two days. That's how bad heroin is. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:00:35       And that's what the government sells that, that, that uh, America, listen man, let's wrap this up and let you get some sleep. All right?
