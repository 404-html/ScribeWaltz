Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Can we go four, three, two

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       on boom, and now we're live. How are you sir? I am wonderful. We had wonderful chat. Ofsted. Yeah, you probably would love to have had that on here, but I just. No, no, no. I would never want to do that to you. Yeah, no idea. Exactly. I wouldn't want to do that too. Yeah. Yeah. So listen man, it's great to see you again. It's good to see you again. Been a while. Yeah, we, I know. We ran into each other once in a bar, men with a random eye candy and I tell her that what it's called. I turned around and you turn around and we made eye contact and eye candy. That was a long time and still have to be about 25 years ago. Four years ago now, right? I know we talked about doing a podcast back then even. Yeah. I'm glad we finally got together and do it.

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       Let me too. It's going to be fun. You did that TV show that I did a long time ago. Joe Rogan questions everything and you blew me away. You and me and Duncan and you showed us all the tricks that people use. Well you didn't. You showed us that they were tricks, but you didn't show us how to do the tricks. Broke one thing down for you, but that was about it. It was a psychological thing because here's the thing, right? It's, it's better to know that you can be fooled rather than tell you how you can be fooled and we'll. We'll get into this about with scientists and how I fold them in a little bit, but people always tell me, why don't you just teach Paris the tricks and the problem is, is for every single trick that I have, I probably have about seven or eight methods, so if I teach you one method, Joe, somebody else will come along and maybe a method had been to key.

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       They'll do it a completely different convincing way and you'll be looking for that one method and you may say because you don't have the experience, you may say, oh, this has to be real. I know how the tricks done. They're not doing that. They are actually doing something completely different. This has to be real, so it's better to get an expert. Let me ask you this one because my friend Eddie was at Venice beach and this guy was doing. He has like some save the rain forest thing and he said, if I tell you your birthday will, will you listen to me and and donate some money or something like that. Right. And he goes, okay, and he just goes May 15th. Right. Just straight out like that. Yeah. I just figured it out. I'm like, how could someone do that? I can't tell you because I wasn't there.

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       There could've been other circumstances. They could have been something you overheard. They could have been something he seen. He may have been in the store when the guy took his driver's license that they could be. There's a million things that could have happened that your friend Eddie was not aware of before that guy even walked up to him. So I can't. I really can't answer that because it's circumstantial. And here's the other thing. Does Eddie really remember everything exactly the way that it was, you know, has he forgotten something and left something out in that story because he's told it so many times. And usually here's the thing, right? When people want to convince you of something, they embellish and the more times they tell that story, that embellishment their reality,

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       they basically create a whole new reality for themselves that they forget that maybe they wrote it down, they forget that maybe they said something, they forget that the person might have asked specific questions. You might've said, yeah, I get the feeling that you're probably not born in the beginning of the year, maybe later in the year, maybe in the fall or something like that. Person says, no, but I am bought land. Even the edit now, you know, it's the winter time, so now you get within a few months right there. So there's, there are always within mentalism, which is what I am, a mentalist and we'll explain what that is in a minute. But um, there are ways to do those things and there's many ways to do those types of things. So without being there, I can't tell you exactly what your friend Eddie experience to him, it was very, very real.

Speaker 3:          00:03:40       You don't believe in any psychic power. I've started to say, okay, it's fair to say, but if you just say it that way, it sounds very cold. It kind of sounds like I'm an asshole. I'm a dick. I'm a skeptic there. Wait, wait. It can't because it means I'm not. Haven't been open minded. I am very open minded about these things and whenever I investigating new phenomena I opened, I stepped back, I put everything that I, I think that, hey, it's not real. I put that aside and go, this could be the one. I'm going to give him a chance, but I'm going to look at it. I am going to be a little bit skeptical. I am going to do a double blind test. I am going to step back and look at it from a scientific point of view. I'm not going to be stupid about this and I'm not going to let them get away with something.

Speaker 3:          00:04:22       And I also know they may be self deceived and I've seen so much of this type of phenomena that I usually know what's going on when I do see it. So I can honestly say that I've seen so much phenomena and I've looked at so much of it and I've seen the best people out there and I've tested some of the best people out there that I have not seen anything indicative. That psychic phenomena is genuine. Have you ever heard of anyone who is reasonably believable that it's seen anything that counts? I hear that all the time. Right? When you see a John Edward on tv or you hear these, these antidotes and stuff like that and it's just like you're telling me about Eddie. So you're telling me that sounds like, oh wow, that person could be really psychic, but I know that there's probably more going on when that person.

Speaker 3:          00:05:08       I'm glad you answered the way you answered because that doesn't make a lot of sense that yeah, you did tell stories and people do forget how the story actually went. The human memory is very flawed. Oh, absolutely. Why? We can change a person's memory, you know, there's been plenty of experiments that have done on that. If you take a certain group of people, I can't remember what her name is. It's just not coming to me. I'm. I have dyslexia as well, which is really weird when you see what I do on stage because I work with numbers, I work with names and they use a lot of mnemonics for these things, so I really hard time recalling names and books that I read and stuff like that. I just. It's really hard to come to me, but it takes a while for those things to your work.

Speaker 3:          00:05:45       Like what does it does? I always thought that it switched things a girl. I did it in high school at it. It does switch things around. Oh, it's one of those things like if I'm working with numbers, I can't. I don't even. I think what it is is I got so disappointed numbers when I was young. I love numbers. I love the fact that everything in the world, his numbers I. I love the idea of numbers of what they do, but I think when I was young I would get so frustrated even in high school and in middle school I would do math problems, but I would figure out a way that worked for me to do the math problem and then the teacher would come up, they say like, show your work, and I would put it down and they'd say, no, that's wrong. I've got, but I got the right answer yet, but that's not the way we do it.

Speaker 3:          00:06:26       You need to do it this way. And the normal way of doing things was extremely difficult for me to switch. It switches numbers around, you know, and if you're trying to switch the letters for me, I'll use words that are the wrong words. I could be talking to you during this podcast and then I'll listen to the podcasts and I'll go, oh my god, why did I use that word? You know, I, I had a thing where, um, I'll give you an example of the type of things that happened to me. I have a line when I say, uh, in, in some of my shows where I say, uh, I read thoughts, not minds. What do I mean by that? Husband and wife are sitting on a park bench, pretty gold goes jogging by husband, turns his head and looks wife, slaps the husband in the face.

Speaker 3:          00:07:07       We know what the husband was thinking. We know what the wife was thinking, right? We haven't read their minds but we do know what their thoughts are. So it's sort of that body language thing. And I remember one time doing this for a skeptic's group and I was on stage and I was like, husband wife is sitting on a park bench, pretty girl walks by husband slaps the wife in the face. So I said it exactly the opposite of the way. And they just thought it was a joke. Like they thought I was being stupid and just just a joke. But I do that kind of stuff consistently and I have a really hard, like if you say so a lot of people will do that, but it's really bad for me. Like I do. I do it consistently, you'll, you'll, you'll talk about things and I hear you talk about things and you'll use words that I actually know what the word means, but if I wanted to recall that word and use it, cannot remember it, but what's the mechanism like?

Speaker 3:          00:07:54       What is happening in your mind where it switches things around? I'll call it dyslexia. I don't know. For me it's just they call it with me, it's the effect and it's a really fucked up word, right? For dyslexics to use dyslexia. Like when they come up with a better word for that. It's really hard for dyslexia. That's the way it is with all that stuff. But it's like I got to list, there's an s in there. It's like, why? Why, why? That's true. Um, so, so you, is there anybody that like, I mean there's the James Randy challenge, right? Famously were which I was in charge of the million dollars and I tested many psychics, but I guess what I should do is probably we're in charge of it. How? So? Let's go back to the beginning. So you understand how I got here on this journey, if that's okay.

Speaker 3:          00:08:42       All right. And I'll talk about a couple of personal things in the very beginning. So I was born in 1960, so I'm 58 years old, you know, so yeah. Uh, and uh, I was born in England, left there and came to the United States. My mom divorced my dad in that year, went back to England and I'm giving you this so you understand where I'm coming from and how I got on this journey. Uh, she had two kids. Uh, we immigrated to South Africa in 1969. She abandoned me in South Africa that time with my two brothers a year and three years old. We had a stepfather who was an alcoholic. We saw and maybe on Sundays maybe if I drag them in from the car into the house, we would see him then. So I was changing diapers. I was taken care of my brothers and so forth. Wow. Uh, and I was there until I was 15 years old.

Speaker 3:          00:09:23       Now it was during that time that I, I heard a guy by the name of Eric [inaudible] who was a famous psychic and he's the first one to claim that he could actually been objects with his mind, like silverware and became really famous for it. He was supposedly a. They did research with him at standard, a stanford researcher at Stanford, Stanford, Stanford Research Institute, and he was using that sort of as an endorsement to say that he was genuine and one of the things that gala did was he said if you bring metalogics to the radio, you can get them to bend as well. So I mean, think about my radio on the radio. There was no talking, there was no tv there at the time. They had Springbok TV, they didn't have the actual station, but they were putting it up and they had tvs in the store at the time, but they were playing Papaya, vhs movies back then, you know, on the one.

Speaker 3:          00:10:10       However they played it back then, but no TV station. So that was the thing. Everybody there listened to the radio and he's like, if you bring it to the radio, you can do it with the unleashed powers of your mind. You can get metal, and so I went around the house. I found a little pin and my mom's old sewing kit and I held it up and I looked at it and I studied it and I concentrated on it and it bent well on a micro level. At least I thought it bends, so I convinced myself that it had been my noodly and another that years later, but in my mind I had got that to happen. From there I went to Australia to go be with my biological dad and from there to Colorado and it was while I was in Colorado that I picked up a book by James, the Amazing Randy and that book said the truth about Uri Geller.

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       And in fact the book was changed. The name was changed years later to the truth about the truth of Uri Geller from the magic of Uri Geller. And that book basically said that early was a magician posing as a psychic and no adult had ever told me that before. All the adults that I did know they believed in early. So I believe in is one I learned a valuable lesson just because people in a position of authority, because there are adults that old or new doesn't make everything they say correct. Which I learned it that way. Um, because keep in mind I was really socially inept because I was always taking care of my brothers. I had no free time, so I wasn't hanging out with other kids. I wasn't doing those things. I had a great life, don't get me wrong, I had a really great life in South Africa. I did stupid stuff like jumping off bridges into trains.

Speaker 3:          00:11:34       This will, we get apples, I have apples to eat at home and stuff like that. Jump off the train and take it home. So those were great things. Those are great times actually believe even though it sounds like it's really sad, it's not. So anyway, I read this book and in the book, uh, Randy sort of mentioned eludes to a method for bending a nail and so I picked the, I got some nails, I started creating my own ways. I'm sort of a problem solver. I can you give me something you want to do and I can go ahead and figure out a way to do it. It's why I worked for people like Chris Angel and you know, David Blaine open his second TV special with one of my effects and I'm the first person to be buried alive six feet on the ground shaman handcuffed in a coffin and dig my way to the surface, which I've done twice and almost died twice during that.

Speaker 3:          00:12:18       Um, but anyway, getting back on track here. So we'll get back to that later. Yeah. So I to hear about that. So I wrote, just gloss over that sir. I'll gloss over a whole bunch of crap. I've done crazy crazy stuff where I should be dead. I look back now and I go, I am really. I mean, even when I was a kid, I was crawling down just just, just to do it. I'd look at the top story window and I'd go, I think I follow down that drain pipe. I think I can do it upside down and I would actually climb upside down using my feet to keep myself up there and climb down the drain pipe to get down. So I did a lot of dump, dump, dump stuff. Um, so I was in high school and I started to create methods for bending silverware.

Speaker 3:          00:12:55       So much so that all the kids there went to plastics are being, their school actually went to plastic silverware because all the kids in there we'll bring in all their silverware to me. So we were getting low and silverware. Um, they went to plastic silverware. I got in trouble. You were bending the silverware with your mind, is that what you're saying? Well, I was making it. I was using tricks to make it look like I was bending it with my mind. Yeah, I was crazy. I was basically doing what Gallo is doing. Only the difference was is I didn't realize it, but until I saw yellow I was. I'd never seen Gallo work. I just heard about him on the radio and I heard you're supposed to see the metal band, so in my mind the effects that I created to bend metal, you actually saw the forks and the spoons and that bending and if you see any magician working today, more than likely they're using a couple of my techniques to make metal look like it's actually bending A.

Speaker 3:          00:13:42       I even figured a way to make the school bell go off so we can get out of school early. I got suspended for that. Why don't you do that? Because I could know how. Oh, how'd you do that? There was a, there was a wire and there was a short that goes through this one classroom that I was in and I was able to figure out how to exactly how to get that short to work with. The bell would go off and we got out of school early. It was just connecting the two and it's like you and connect. You connect and it goes off, so it was like, Whoa, okay, this is great and good that I with the clock up on the wall, if you look at a clock, I realized that as the clock hand goes around all the way around, it looks like it's slowing down when it comes back up.

Speaker 3:          00:14:16       It's not. It's just an optical illusion from one side, so I would make kids think that I was making the clock slow down and I figured a way on an old time timex watch that I used to be at a way that if I pulled the stem out and slowly turned it backwards and pushed it in, the secondhand would keep moving for about 35 seconds and then it would just start like going click, click, click, and then it would stop so I could put my watching somebody's hands. So I come up with all these different methods for accomplishing all these different feats. I started learning how to do a thing called muscle reading, which we can talk about in a little bit. Muscle reading. Yeah. It's like if it's an old, old technique that nobody uses and I was really surprised that people were not using it, but it was really, really popular back in the late 18 hundreds where if you.

Speaker 3:          00:14:59       If I take your wrist and it's based upon the idiomotor response, if I take your risks and I tell you, look at my other hand and I want you to imagine it actually touching an object. Think of one of these objects, five objects on a table. Think of my hand actually touching it and I move my left hand, which you're not holding here. Actually I'm holding who you with my right hand, but I'm moving your hand in sync with it. I will. If you're thinking, go to the left, go to the left or the left. I can actually feel the resistance when I go to the right in your arm so you give off this, this, this thing that lets me know exactly where to go and you could kreskin did it with his check. He would hide the check and and before that polgar did it with his check and I've done it with my check when I do shows in the past where they can hide your check anywhere in the theater.

Speaker 3:          00:15:45       You take somebody's head and you tell them to think of my other hand and they have to know where the objects hidden and think of that hand actually going there and touching it and you can actually find the object. So I was doing a lot of muscle reading back in those days and everybody. What about you get some stone cold psychopath? Not No. They. They have to really truly be thinking it and wanting it to happen and that's why I reframe it in the aspect of you see me do things with my mind. I want you to try and do something with your mind. Will this hand to actually touch that object so they do and they don't realize that subtly there pushing and pulling you in the right direction and you can even say them, don't pull me in the direction. Let me pull you, but you're still pulling and pushing with them and you can find the actual logic.

Speaker 3:          00:16:24       And so I wrote a book on it. It's called psychophysiological thought, reading psychophysiological physiological reading, lot reading, which is isolating. I didn't know that. What I did was we call it bustle, reading in the business and in the business. Yeah. And I started looking at some of the older terms for it and I found that term psychophysiological thought reading. I thought that's a great name for the book because every book I've written on mentalism, because I write books that teach people and video I have. They all start with a pea size series, you know, it's, it's. Yeah. So it's all I've talked to, you know, I've talked to penn about magic and about illusions and, and he's, you know, funny about it and he laughs and says it's all lies and bullshit and you know, he makes it seem fun, but the way you described it, it became a little bit more compelling because you're, you're, you're seemingly obsessed with it.

Speaker 3:          00:17:14       Like obviously to get as good as you got at becoming a mentalist like you, you had to be like, even the way that you rattle off things you, there's very little pause to you. You stop and start and I talk too fast. I know everybody says you talk. We don't talk too fast. You just talk fast. Yeah, I mean I can hear you. It's very clear. But that's also what I noticed when you were doing the reading, when we did it in front of the crowd of people and you were able to pick out certain things that didn't make the air because it didn't fit the format of the show at that time. One of the things, what, what Joe Joe's talking about is there's a part in the show where I ask people just to think of things. Um, and then I start getting initials and then I get names and then I get, um, yeah, you're, you're actually thinking about your grandmother and how you went on a bike ride with her through certain forests.

Speaker 3:          00:18:03       Then went to Lake Chelan pull pack and your birth date is this and that. And I did a birthday freaking stuff there. Yeah. Yeah. But it was the weirdest thing is like they, they're also overwhelmed by the fact that you never stopped talking like it just, it's just ready go pro. It just keeps coming like, Huh, how do you know that? And then, no, don't, don't worry about that. We'll get that to the minute, you know, where that comes from. Jail. That comes from back in my early days I, I, um, well in the very beginning. Well let's, let's get you in with the story. I'll get to, I'll get to that to where I work the places because that sort of comes from working the comedy clubs and some really Shitty shitty places and having to grab people's attention. Um, so from there I ended up writing randy and letter a just out of the blue because I was getting a little cocky I guess at young, you know, that age because I was getting away with all this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:18:49       And Randy let, I said, look, if you ever need a kid to try to convince scientists, this stuff is real, I would be happy to so long as I come out and say it's a hoax at the very end. I had a couple of hypothesis, um, and one of them was at scientists implemented for years. There's no evidence of the esp on a proper scientific controls. And this is back in the eighties because a lack of funding, it was my contention had nothing to do with funding. You have to do with the scientists were going with the pro biased opinion and they would documenting their own beliefs rather than using proper science. First of all, to find out if it was even genuine. So they were not using the proper scientific method. They would basically just saying, I believe this is real. I'm going to get it on tape or I'm going to get it to where I can document it.

Speaker 3:          00:19:30       So the rest of the world that slowly down where they biased towards believing that it was real or fake, no believing it was real. Because you don't get. Usually you don't get into Paris psychology unless you have an interest in it and usually you don't have an interest in it unless you think there's something there. Right. Do those ghost shows drive you fucking crazy? Yeah, they do. Because I know I've actually been. I've actually been called to work on a couple of them behind the scenes that I always tell them, no, I can't do it, and I have some friends that have worked on them behind the scenes to try to make some of the investigators freak and they're using magic tricks to get the investigators freak and the great thing about those kinds of shows is you only need to do one little thing, just something falling off a shelf because it just.

Speaker 3:          00:20:09       That's all you need, right? I mean it's like, yeah, there's a ghost. It fell off the shelf because they play that tape over and over and over again and they show a little shadow or something like that. There's nothing dumber on television now, now and and smarter than I know for a fact. There are people that work behind them, behind those scenes at fooling those guys. When we work, I work with Chris Angel a lot. Alright. Uh, the early days I worked with him on almost all of his EPA shows. I've done over a 100 episodes of television with Chris and we, every year we would do one episode that was a silence episode, that type of thing. And uh, we brought a group of researchers in and the moment they got off the bus, we had all this stuff set up and everything else to mess with them.

Speaker 3:          00:20:52       The moment they got off the bus, I told my guys, I said, we're not using any of that which is going to use pure psychology with these people. And that's what happened because I could tell they was, they was such believable. Anything I suggest to them they're going to go for. So let's say we have six rooms and I need this one room to be the room that is haunted because that's a story that goes on behind it with something else that's already been said and position or it's got to match up with a bunch of celebrities who feels something in the room as well. All I gotta do is once we go in to, you know, you fill anything, so yeah, I feel a little haunting. I feel this and that, you know, this room I really want you to take time with. That's all I have to say.

Speaker 3:          00:21:31       And it's the psychics getting headaches and they just, they go, they go crazy because I've already put it in their head at that point. Okay. So the stuff they come up with is going to be much more believable than any of the little tricks that we had, like hidden recordings and stuff like that. The stuff they come up with is going to be much more believable and much more of a hit. Are there any real like supernatural investigators that actually believe in ghosts or they all come? People know there's people investigators that believe in it. Yeah, absolutely. They'll show, isn't it? They must know they're fucking think. Yeah. Like, um, uh, what is it? A paranormal state was one of them, you know, and, and I, I think it's, some of them are a little abusive too because they work with little kids sometimes and they talk the kids into believing these things and, and, and it's just, some of them are a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:22:19       Yeah, there's a little creepy little creepy what they do to them and you know, they usually don't have a psychologist taking care of the people afterwards to work them through it and it's just, it's the psychologist I do is also a paranormal investigator that believes in these kinds of things and it's going to come at it a very slanted angle. So I've not seen a single one of these shows that I don't look at it and go bullshit and just end up turning it off. So yeah. Now did they, I mean, but is there anybody who like legitimately, like anybody who's a reasonable person who legitimately believes in ghosts and legitimately believes in every movie, every haunt horror movie. There's always like this one real researcher that there are people like Lloyd Lloyd, Alabama, and you know, who I know is he believes in this kind of stuff too.

Speaker 3:          00:23:06       And you have a tumor. No, it doesn't have a tumor as far as I know. He does not have it too. A nice. He's a nice guy. I respect a lot of these guys. I get along with it. I think you have to, right? Because you've got to be at a debate with these people. You got to be able to talk to them and if you show them respect, they're going to show you reason with them and sort of explain why what they're doing is faulty or we, we have, we have, we have conversations about certain things, certain type of testing, you know, and, and how, how ridiculous some of these things are. And, and, um, but you know, they're going to be convinced that there's something there. Even if it's a little little something like one little thing, you can't quite knock out a way where they can do.

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       I mean, it's like when I worked with a pat, so back then Washington University in 1979, James McDonald gave a half million dollars to washing university. All right? And that was shortly after I had wrote Randy that let him and now James Mcdonald, he was Mcdonald aircraft, uh, you know, the banshee and all those different types are all named after spirits by the way. Yeah. Yeah. So if you take, if you do your research, you'll find all these things. So he really truly believed in, in, in the afterlife. And His thinking was, look, if they can find something that's even psychic, that might be indicative that maybe there's an afterlife, you know, at least it's indicative that something supernatural paranormal. There are things we don't understand. So we gave half a million dollars washing university, the form of a laboratory called the Mcdonald Mcdonald Laboratory for psychical research short, we call it Mac lab, a Peter Phillips there had an interest in Paris psychology, but really didn't want to get involved.

Speaker 3:          00:24:36       But the university said, look, we want this money. We want this lab. Um, you believe in this kind of stuff. You know, you're interested in San and stuff and he was a physicist so they put him in charge. Uh, they had over 300 and some applicants and out of all the, I sent them a letter out of all the applicants they had. There was only two that were accepted. I mean, they did some research with other people there too that they really accepted. It was myself and another kid that I didn't know at the time by the name of Michael Edwards. Um, and uh, Michael turned out to be a magician as well. And he had also spoke to randy, so I get a call. I said that there was an associated press article that came out and that's when I wrote to them and they said, yeah, we'd like to, we'd like you to come visit.

Speaker 3:          00:25:19       I get a call from randy. He says, you know, there's this guy at Washington University, he was being given half a million dollars to study psychic phenomenon. Like, can you just think of his initials for me? I said, is a p and a p? He said, how did you know? I said, I've already been accepted, I was going to let you know, and he started telling me about Mike, that Mike had already been there. Mike had been to key in their hands. They were completely convinced that this was real psychic phenomena, but at that point Mike wasn't quite sure where to take it. And he knew randy was the expert at the bunker in the field because randy had the debunk geller and other psychic phenomenon. So he wrote, he spoke with Randy on the phone and, and I wrote to randy as well, and they had some conversations and I said to randy, I said, can I trust Mike?

Speaker 3:          00:25:57       He says, I don't know enough about him to trust him. And Mike had the same concerns about me because randy had mentioned me to him and said, you should mention, you know what my real name is Stephen Shaw. So it's Steven Shaw back then check came years later because people couldn't remember. Stephen Shaw think you remember a check because of the. I say, here's the LTV. So I, I did a corporate gig one day and um, which is good that you say that. So I did a Gig one day, uh, it was a corporate gig and the guy got up there and he's like, either I was really insecure, you know, as we already talked about. So I had my introduction, here's my introduction. And uh, he says I want to do my own introduction. You know, about you. I've seen you do different things in that. So he gets up there and he says, seen on the today show CNN live.

Speaker 3:          00:26:39       Um, he's done this, he's done that. I've seen him do this and that. Please welcome Steven. What was the last name again? Sorry. Great. So I get up, I do my Gig, I got another corporate gig that week. I get up and say the last guy, I forgot my name please. You know, remember, my name is Stephen [inaudible]. Stephen Shaw. Yeah, I got it. No problem. He's done this. He's done that. He's on that. Please welcome Steven. What was the last name again? Holy Crap. It happened to me or third time. And so I started thinking about why is this happening and how can I fix this? Well, one way to fix it probably I think back now, is just say, hey, read my thing. Don't even memorize it, just read it. But Stephen is such a common name and Shaw is such a common name. There's really no real hard syllables.

Speaker 3:          00:27:19       And then except for maybe the team at the va a little bit, but not really. It's a soft syllable so it kind of passes right through the brain. So they're thinking so much about everything else they want to say, you know, cnn live the today, show this and that. I've seen in their story that they want to tell them everything. So by the time they get to my name, they haven't really thought about my name or memorize my name. So I wanted a name that had at least two hearts syllables, something that would stick in the brain. And I wanted a one word name, not a two word name, one word name, like a rapper. Yeah, this is. But this is before I'm dating myself. This was a real wrap prepared. That's it right there. So C, c, e, k right there, and I loved that show.

Speaker 3:          00:28:00       He was at insurance, a detective and was that show on? I don't know. I think it was only one season, right? If I'm not mistaken, Jamie, I don't know if you look that up on it, but I think it was asleep. Susan right here. Season one season. That was a great show because he always had these great Polish sayings that meant absolutely nothing, but it was just. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Very charismatic in that show. But the, the way he sold it was almost like a magic trick. It was like they put the statue on the truck, the truck arrives and it goes all the way across the United States and no statue. Where did it go? It turns out that what they actually put on the truck, they thought it was a statute because it was covered and it was in this crate, but it was a block of ice.

Speaker 3:          00:28:40       So by the time it got there, it had already been switched out. By the time it got there, it had melted. So it's sort of magic in its own way as well. So I, it was sort of kindred spirits in a way to that and I love the name band check and I was like, you know what, if I use banner check the way it's spelt there, they going to say Ben Sec. And so I put B, a c, h, e k, I didn't want to put an extra seat at the end because then it becomes bounced a check or something stupid like that. So yeah, I get banana check, I get bonus check, you know, I get all these things but, but at least here's the thing, right? So the old time is back then the ceos of the company, the presidents of the company, if they remember the TV show, they may make fun of me at first, but they're going to remember the name at the end of the show. They now associate it with me because I've blown their minds. If they don't know it, they've got to come up to me and say, how do you pronounce that? So they're thinking about my name. Never had a problem since. So there's the old TV show, banner check, but the way I spell it, there was a grey hound a, there was a dog, uh, there was a band called

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       a check and there was a construction company. Now the construction company owned the bank check earl, you know, the website, but they didn't do anything with it. So. And this is back before you could do automatic payments, like it just goes every year automatically for you. So I would sit there every year just waiting on that all every day, you know, when I knew it was going to go up and I finally got it. Like I get after three years of it just sitting there, I finally was able to get it. But yeah. So anyway, that's my name, that's how I got my name. Okay. So go back to this Michael Edwards. So Mike Edwards. So I go off on these weird. I do this all the time. I go off on so many different tangents because it's so many different stories and so many different directions I can go.

Speaker 2:          00:30:24       So with Mike, um, and, and you'll find that out in my life. There is so much psychology applied to everyday life for me, like the name, why did I choose my name? There was a reason for it. They say it's not just haphazard and stuff like that, or sometimes it's just a joke. Like, you know, I get really sarcastic sense of humor. Me here. I go off on another tangent. All right, let's go back. Um, so here I am with a, uh, brandy telling me about them in it and I said, Yep, I've already been accepted. Mike and I are supposed to show up. Um, and by the way, somebody recently bought my Barry Sonnenfeld had bought my light life rights with because of this whole thing, which is called project Alpha that I'm telling you the story about now. And uh, he had bought it and wanted a Aaron Sorkin to write it, but this is way back then.

Speaker 2:          00:31:08       No, this is now like not so long. A couple of years ago, following up with your timeline, I know Aaron was. Aaron was. Aaron was busy so he couldn't do it. Uh, and, and then when he wasn't busy, Barry got busy in my life. Rights. What they had were basically, you know, ran out, so we've taken it now and I'm working with another production company to do a series on what we're talking about right now. So, but anyway, so here I am, I'm with Mike Edwards. We show up at the airport in St Louis. First Time we get to meet, we meet each other, we hit it off right away. I don't have my driver's license. I had some form informed idea. I don't want it for my id. I had some of the former Id, uh, Mike, uh, he had his and he could drive. He just got his at the time.

Speaker 2:          00:31:49       So I wonder if I use my password then. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing, you do this, this fast talking thing. This is part of the shuck and jive though. This is a little bit of me but as I understand, but it also is very effective. That's what a shuck and jive artist does. They talk very fast and they never pause, so you never get a chance to interject and they're constantly going. So if they're reading euro or saying something, you have to keep up with them and part of the keeping up with them as you get a Little Bit Wilderness and bewildered, you forget what you've said or they've said and you're trying to sort of keep pace with them and you can. And next thing you know, they're like, oh my God, I can't believe you know that. How'd you figure that out? Well, we'll get to that later and then you keep going and you keep as part of the entertainment aspect of it.

Speaker 2:          00:32:33       Yeah. It's not what I'm doing right now because they're sharp as when he was fighting, he would put a piece on you you couldn't keep with, right? Yeah. See, you always analyze it with fighting, which is great. It's kind of that thing. Vulnerabilities and exploit vulnerabilities in the human mind. They. One of them is that you talk and think faster than most people. So most people when you're talking, they don't have it. Right. You just did right there. You want to get a chance to interject because I'm gonna keep talking and as I keep talking I talk quicker and you get bewildered. That's one of the things that you do to people, whether you realize it or not, you do it because you've done it that way for a long time. It's probably become a pattern, has become a pattern to make the other person feel unsecure so you don't know what you're paying for.

Speaker 2:          00:33:14       It's a patent for me being able to think and not forget things as I'm saying them like because like as you so effective that you said that. There is another thing that popped in my. I got like all day long. I have songs in my head. It doesn't stop. Like I, I do this with my teeth all the time. Playing the music in my head like constantly. If I'm not thinking about anything else, I have songs in my head constantly and I've even. I went to the dentist and I said, Hey, I've got this thing with my teeth and I'm tapping my teeth. I'm wearing him down. You know what's going on? And he says, oh, musicians do that all the time. I go, well, I always have music 24 hours a day in my head. So wow. But now I've gone off somewhere and they would say, oh, the handwriting.

Speaker 2:          00:33:52       So if you look at my hand, look my hand writing how bad my head, right? Like it's really hard to freaking read. Right? But it's not that bad. Somebody just wrote me a letter and I read the letter. Somebody, a friend of mine sent me something. He wrote me a letter and I've read his letter. I was like, well what the fuck is that? Because it's just scribbled. Well that's me writing neat. So slow. So slow. Normally when I write I can't read it myself. I. Well that's the thing, what you just said, you, you, you, you're trying to keep up with your thoughts. Yeah. And that's one of the things about bad handwriting. They say that you're trying to keep up with what you're thinking and learning. It's always going a mile a minute. It's a thousand different ways. And I think it's part of my problem solving is like when people give me ideas that they want, okay, this is what I'd like to do as a magic effect.

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       How do I do it? I'm able to rattle off like 10, 15 different. But it's like as a mentalist that way that, that pattern of talking is so bewildering to people that they just sort of like, Huh, what? What? Huh? And you've got them on the ropes. Always is that thing of even in my state show. And you'll have to come to the state show. Something I would love. I would love you to come see the mini version of it. When you did the television show, I was blown away. I mean, the first thing I do is I come out before I don't even introduce myself. Where did you do it? So if people can what they want to see. I was just at Planet Hollywood filling Vegas. Yeah. I've got a, uh, a thing coming up, uh, at Rochester, a fringe festival in Rochester, New York. I mean, I'm at a lot of different college. You can go to my website, [inaudible] dot com and look up the dates, but the Rochester is going to be a on the 13th at 7:00 PM. 40th 5:00 PM that I'm on the 20th at 9:00 PM, 2:23 PM. I know. So you can find it on the path. You can't even help yourself. You can find it on them. You're going to find it on the website. So it is on the website yet,

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       but you're in vegas all the time. Right? I'm in Vegas a lot. Work Vegas that much. I'm busy now really until I'm beginning of November. I'm going to be like different places. Just touring, touring different places. Some of it's corporate, some of it's college, you know, it's a mixture of a mismatch of different, different things. So go back to this whole James, Randy, Uri Geller. So here I am with a Mike Edwards at the airport and we're hitting it off and everything. Peter Phillips shows up and he's the professor that I mentioned a minute ago who's going to be doing the investigating of us and he has this wristband on and I'm always asking questions. What's this, what's that? And I'm always noticing things and he said it was a wristband that he got from a witch doctor in Africa that helps protect him. So I'm starting to think this might be a little easier than I thought it was going to be going in.

Speaker 3:          00:36:24       I was like, I didn't know these guys skeptical. They give you these one way. Mirrors. Are they gonna be trying to trick us, catches. I had no clue. So we get into, uh, we were, we had Peter Phillips, his car because Mike was too young to drive a rental. Peter Phillips has at Rental Reynolds in front of us who were following him. And this is, this is how it all starts. Really. I'm sitting there and just kind like be talking all the time. I'm looking around, I'm always doing something. Always noticing something. I look in the backseat and I noticed as a briefcase I reached in the back and I kind of pull it under the Dash. It's locked into me. Like if somebody locked something, it means they don't want you inside there. Of course. Right. But why does anyone is in their old briefcase easily. You can just open the locks.

Speaker 3:          00:37:06       So I pick the locks, open it up inside. There's a whole bunch of silver. So either this guy's a Kleptomaniac or this is a civil right. He's going to be using for the experiments. So I stopped bending it all up, lock the briefcase, put it in the back, sit there for about two more minutes, open up the glove compartment, this extra keys and things in the glove compartment. I stopped bidding those up instead his fucking keys. I ha. Well I'm a psychic, right? This stuff happens to those keys and getting his house. Yeah. But I needed him to be convinced that was genuine. So I ended up looking over the car keys that are hanging out, the keys that are hanging out on the car. Key out of the ignition. I start to reach over to get them. And Mike just looks at me and says, I think you've done enough.

Speaker 3:          00:37:46       Stop. You know. So. But there's this really interesting phenomenon, right? We knew that in the laboratory, everything we did at that point was going to be on a micro level. It's going to be very small because it had to be because we couldn't make it look like it's a trick. We had to look like my newt and not just that. We didn't know if they were going to be watching it. Like I said, through one way mirrors and things like that, so this interesting phenomenon at the time that was called spontaneous pk and that is stuff that just happened. Hey Pete psychokinesis PKA shorter for the sector cases, telekinesis, psychokinesis, the whole thing. They all have the same thing, so there's these things just supposedly happened around these psychics that can bend metal stuff, moves, stuff breaks that. So those things were the things that would convince him and keep him holding on.

Speaker 3:          00:38:34       Even if we did a big band out of the laboratory but not on camera. That's the thing that would keep him going. I want to get that on film. I definitely want to get that on film. I'm going to document that someday. That's going to happen in the laboratory. When we ended up getting to the laboratory, all the students at the university were extremely skeptical, very, very skeptical, but they had heard about the spontaneous pk, so they hit things under neath, the video recorders in it. There was a separate room and they hit all kinds of things everywhere around. I noticed there was stuff hidden. I mean, why is it recorded? Had none of that VCR, you know, why is there a fork hidden behind that cupboard, you know, it doesn't belong there. So I started bending up all those things on lunchtime and that convinced all the students that we were genuine as well.

Speaker 3:          00:39:20       So this, this, this, this, this whole thing went on and on. It's a simple as. So what happened was immediately randy sent them a list of 13 caveats things that we, that they shouldn't do, and it was common sense stuff, right? It was stuff like, don't let the subjects work at the same time because they could distract you. Don't let them work with more than one object at a time because they could confuse you with those objects as to which ones you bending and there was this whole list of different things. They showed the list to me and Mike and had a good laugh about it and said, this would make you guys so uncomfortable. We want you to be comfortable where in reality they should have followed that list because one of the things randy said was mark everything on a micro micro and a macro level so they the subjects can see the macromark but won't realize as a micro mark on there as well, which would have helped because their idea of doing a macro mark was on every fork.

Speaker 3:          00:40:15       They took the fork or spoon. They measured it at both ends, like the height from the table and they measured the middle of the four from the height from the table. Then they put a label on it on a little string with a number on it and that was her idea of keeping track of if something had bent on. Not because they would measure it after we concentrated on it and they would then remeasure it again afterwards and they would say, oh, okay, this is a. This has been a millimeter or two millimeters. So we would do things like, we would say, this tags in my way. Can I take it off? Yeah, you can take it off. We put it down, concentrate on it, didn't do anything. Put it down on the table, pick up another fork or spoon. Say, do you mind if I remove this tag?

Speaker 3:          00:40:54       Take it off, put it down, concentrate on it. Nothing happens. Switched the tags around on the one that was on the first one to the second one, the second one of the first one, and then put the two folks off to the side and then wait two, three hours later, pick up one of those forks. Obviously not doing anything with it. Concentrating on it. Say, why don't you measure it, and they would measure it and the measurements had now changed not realizing because they never measured the other one again because I remembered everything consistently later on and put new tires on them. Every single time, not realizing that we just simply switched forks or as we reached across the table, we would lean on one of the forks and then ours again later we would pretend like we actually bought that for. So this went on.

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       I mean it went on for 180 hours over four years. I mean, we messed with these people bad. We did probably some things at the time that were probably illegal as well, like leaving the window unlocked at the laboratory, going off to the club across the state line, coming back like about four or 5:00 in the morning, break it into the building and bending up every single piece of metal that was in the laboratory. They had a fucking scientists. We're running this. Well, this is back in the eighties. So. Right. And they, they had, they actually had this aquarian back in the 80 scientists were like eighties TV shows. No, it's true. And here's the sad thing, right? I went into this thinking these people were going to be the enemy. It was me against them. You know, I had to do this. Turns out these are just really, really nice, nice people that are very naive when it comes to what psychic phenomena as well.

Speaker 3:          00:42:27       If you're a scientist, most likely you're not studying a whole lot of liars and mentalist magicians and psychic phenomenon and you really are probably trying to find out whether or not it's real and maybe you believe a little bit too much. You don't know enough yet when it came to this type of phenomena. Absolutely. But you gala was already doing that. Other psychics are already doing it in other countries and they will be invalidated as a genuine thing in other countries. Yeah. We brought over in France, Steven North over in England, you know, there was a lot of research going on in England at the time on this type of phenomena as well. It was a really big thing back then. It was just people hosing people. It was a little kid. So here's a weird thing, right? So over in England there were, um, I can't think of what the guy's name is now.

Speaker 3:          00:43:12       Uh, there was a scientist over there, a pair of psychologist who was working with little kids, and his thinking is that kids don't lie. Little kids don't lie. That's all they do is lie. They get to that point where they learned how to lie to get anything and everything. Kids don't lie. That's someone without kids. And these kids only got caught. The only reason they got caught, which by accident because they were the video cameras are left on and soon as the Paris psychologist left the room, the kids were taking forks and spoons and actually bending them underneath their feet and then putting them back up on the, on the table. So then they would come in. It was literally scientists went in with the premise that children don't lie. That is one of the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life. Don't disagree with you, but this is how badly people wanted to believe in this phenomenon.

Speaker 3:          00:43:53       Why do people want to believe in hidden powers? I think it's white. People want to believe in most things, right? I mean, we want to find, we want to believe there's something more than just us, like for most people we're just, we're not enough and I don't know if it's because we get so bored with our lives, we get depressed without lies, we get, you know, we're in this everyday thing of going to work, coming home. And is this all there is, is this, that, you know, is there something else that, that's a super power that I could, I could actually have. Is there something I can discover that's bigger than me? Better than me, you know, does this a units versus much bigger than just this planet right here. Right. So, I mean if you asked me, I think that

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       if you, if a Ufo is, we'll come in here. If they were coming here, let's say, I don't believe they were, but if they were coming here you don't believe they were. But I think if they, I just don't, I, I don't. I think we would really have real evidence. One hundred percent evidence of it by now. But here's the thing, right? Wouldn't it make much sense? Even like for us? Okay, let's say we start going looking at other planets, are we going to send other humans out there or are we going to go ahead and send robots or something like that? They can last much. Yeah, like in the last month and robots are getting better and better and better. So if there's an advanced civilization, civilization, surely they would also have this advancement where they don't have to send themselves out. They can send something to represent them.

Speaker 2:          00:45:13       Right. What the real hardcore believers believe those grades are gray aliens. The big black eyes. They think there's some sort of a android or something and it could be, but I don't believe. I don't believe we had him. I believed a lot more before I started doing that television show. The television show cured me of bigfoot, cured me of psychics, cured me of aliens, cured me of almost everything. Well, this is a thing with me, right? When I was a young kid, I believe in that stuff. You know, when I was a young kid, I spoke in tongues. I thought they did. Yeah. Yeah. I had the whole experience. I mean, it was like, you know, all the chemicals running through my body and me just doing the whole damn thing, you know, and go into that. And I realized later what was going on at the time I was looking for answers.

Speaker 2:          00:45:56       I was looking for answers. So you mentioned that a very disturbed life and you're probably looking for some sort of security. I got shut down every single time I would ask the questions. I was called a troublemaker, you know, oh, we're talking about darkness and evil. Oh, well how come the Bible's covered in black to shut up? Don't ask questions. You know, I've written black. What do you mean? Well, you know, the cover of most of the bibles back then we didn't have the white bibles. We all had the black bibles and it was just, I would just ask innocent questions like, okay, well how can I, if, if you're talking about darkness being, you know, an evil and you're, you know, it's all associated. Why is this Bible covered in black? You know, and I just wanted answers, was looking for answers. I would ask these questions and I do that.

Speaker 2:          00:46:33       I, I thirst knowledge, I love knowledge, you know, I read all the time. It's just I'm always looking to try to understand things. I won't always retain all that information, but it'll be in the back of my head somewhere where it will pop out at some point when I do need it. So. But it is fascinating. This desire to believe, especially the desire to believe things that don't necessarily make sense. Whether it's ghosts or it's Ufos or do you ever watch that show? Finding bigfoot? I have in the past. It's not something I sit down and binge it, but every episode is like a rock got thrown or this same as these gaucher like that every week nothing happens, but somehow they managed to keep you glued to your seat. I think you watch it. People watch it because they think, oh, this is going to be the show.

Speaker 2:          00:47:15       This is going to be the one because they tease it like that. But here's the thing, right? If it was the one we would have already heard about it before it got to air. The key is night vision. Once you have night vision, you seem legit. He looking for things in the basement. Are you looking for things in the woods? If you have night vision or thermal visions, like something. Oh, technology. They'll find it now where it's like the ghost detecting meters, so it's a little meetings. You can set them off just by hitting a walkie talkie. Oh, you can? Oh yeah. Like way across the room or in another room. You had a walkie talkie. Those things go freaking crazy. You know, in the in paranormal research. Is there like a moment? Where. Do you know that in Seti? Search for extraterrestrial intelligence. There's A. There's this one phenomena that happened.

Speaker 2:          00:47:59       I think they call it the blip or something like that. Yeah, I don't think that's the name. I think it was either. There's this one or whatever it is. There's one loud noise that came from space that they think is. They don't know what it is. They're not sure what that was, so you know what? I'm conflating it with something that happened under water. That's what I'm doing. There was something. There was an organic noise that was underwater. It wasn't the signal that's the cold, the bloop, whatever it was. There's a steady thing like that. There is a steady thing like that too, but I'm. I, I confused the two events that there was something that happened where they recorded an organic sound underwater from some sort of an animal that they don't know what it was, but they think it could be a whale or something.

Speaker 2:          00:48:42       Who knows? Just something could be something you discovered you hadn't seen yet. I mean, it's a lot of stuff under there we don't know about for sure. Big Place. Yeah. When we're talking about the desire for people, I mean this is what one of the reasons why being a mentalist works or being one of these psychic hoaxers works is because people have this overwhelming desire to believe there's something more out there and not just the powers that you and I possess the normal sense of seeing and hearing and touching and smelling and d, but there's more. Some people have more, some people knowing the phone's going to ring. Some people know things. They have an intuition. They could sense rs. Some people. No, hold on, hold my hand. Let me look in your eyes. I know things. I know. Things you don't know. It's like the creepy how you're looking at me right now.

Speaker 2:          00:49:25       Just weird. That's a weird thing, right? But that's what the desire because it gives us a white. Why would somebody be looking at me like that if there wasn't a purpose and if you believe in if there wasn't something when I perform, I don't just read minds. I, I do things like I touch their hand, I seen him look at me, see this right there, and I do certain things because it's that thing of like I've got to show a process and if I'm showing a process, why would I be showing a process if it wasn't real? Now here's the weird thing was so overwhelming them with things to think about. Yeah, to a point. I know we you touching them and moving them or looking at them as all these variables they have to take into account and they're on their map of things that they're processing. That's now some new territory. Yeah, it, it, it also. We talked about this earlier. We got to come. We've got so many stories all over the place. We stopped at that. I'll try to come back to some of them, but it's back in my comedy club days. I worked the worst and the best clubs. I mean that was at the comedy workshop in Houston, Texas. I don't know if you remember them on. Sure. Paul Solos, Sharon, and they

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       had me come and do a Christmas show because I wanted a clean show for Christmas and I came in and then they're like, all right, you're going to go out in the road and you're headlining. Like straight off headlining. No middling, no, no opening act, nothing. I went straight into headline in which a lot of comedians hated me for that because they're working so hard to get and it's like there's no place for magic in a comedy club. It's a comedy club, but I was going out. I was doing these comedy clubs, but I was doing like the best and I was also doing the worst, like I always doing comedy clubs where literally it's a kick a bar in a, uh, an oil town and there's Mesh like in blue brothers, you know, across the front because people throw beer bottles at the band and everything else and I'm performing behind that with a little gate that they have to come in for me to perform with these people with a big pole in the middle because people kick her dance around that and the bar is actually around the corner and I got to try and get people in that.

Speaker 3:          00:51:13       So I performed at the worst and the best places I performed in situations where people were just not there to see the performer there. You know, at colleges where it's a, a day show and day, a mandate shows are the worst in colleges. The worst if you've done them. Yeah. Like you come in, it's like they're sitting in the cafeteria. You are performing the cafeteria, they're trying to study for a test. They're not there for you. So I got to grab their attention. So my first thing is to come out and say, if I was to ask everyone to think of a playing card, you might think ace of spades, queen of hearts, I want everyone to think of a car. I'd get one, get one, get one, get one, stand up. And it's like Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. It where it's like, holy crap, we need to pay attention to the sky.

Speaker 3:          00:51:53       And so that's where I came in from those harsh days. Really just trying to grab their attention with comedians. Do Bar gigs. Yeah, you just got to, you got to quiet them down. You got to go to grab him. So anyway, so I'm with the scientists. Uh, we break in, in the laboratory at night. Uh, they have an aquarium, there's another psychic there that supposedly gets ghosts to come in and the ghost will write things in these coffee grounds, in this inverted aquarium, a with a padlock on it. And there's bars that go over it. My Kid, the other kid that's with it looks underneath and realizes that the, even though it's locked on top, the post that it's locked to those nuts underneath it, like bolts, he just unbolted it, lifts it up. We write stuff in the coffee grounds, we bolt it back up and you know, so it's like all these things and we bend everything.

Speaker 3:          00:52:41       Uh, we go to bed about five in the morning and uh, Peter Phillips calls and he calls it about seven in the morning. He says, how you doing? I said, oh, I didn't sleep well last night. I had a dream that we were in the laboratory, you know, trying to work and everything just bent and went crazy. He said, well, go back to sleep. I'll talk to you in a few hours. He calls me back in about another hour. He says, you did it, you did it. You did it. And I go, what did we do? He goes, you know, he says, your psychic powers when you were sleeping, bent everything in the laboratory. So it was just, we play these games. We did these live. He's still alive. I've met him since then, feel tricked him. He felt, well, here's the thing, I felt bad. So we were talking to randy at one point because, um, we did a conference and there's a kid by the name of muscle, walkie Chiodo.

Speaker 3:          00:53:27       Alright. Uh, from Japan, Masa walkie could speak English. She had a band that he was in as well. Um, so we sang English songs and everything and I'm rooming with him and I say to muscle walkie Kyoto because he's playing it up for real, like, you know, and I say, is there anytime when you can't do your psychic powers, you use a trick. And he says, oh, can't speak English, cannot speak English. All of a sudden he couldn't speak English. So with this gallows at the thing as well. Um, and the reason I mentioned muscle walk is because there was a TV producer from England that came over and he said to randy, said, randy, what would convince you that this stuff is genuine? Rainy, gave him the same 11 caveats that he gave to the scientist, the same 11 carrots. And uh, the guy followed them.

Speaker 3:          00:54:08       He sat with me. He sat with Mike, he sat with muscle walkie up the muscle walk. He had a way for twisting a spoon and basically had a thing in his shoe. He would go down and when nobody was looking, put it in there, but because this guy followed the 11 caveats, nothing happened that day. Absolutely nothing happened until the cameras went off. The moment the cameras went off, muscle walkie twist that a spoon and started getting it to twist. The producer had a complete mental breakdown. Now, to this point, I'm just thinking, this is tricks, right? It's not. It's not that big of a deal. He starts screaming, yelling that randy's evil should never have listened to randy. He would've got this on tape if it wasn't for Randy and he looks down and he's got a wet spot on the front of his pants and he looks down and he says, I just had a demonic ejaculation, like literally, and he's having his mental breakdown. I go and I have to spend the night, which was not a bad thing. She was quite pleasant to look at his his assistant. I had to spend the night with her in her room because randy was calling her. I'm not randy. I mean, uh, uh, Tony editable calling of the producer was calling her consistently screaming and yelling about randy and this scared them.

Speaker 2:          00:55:20       Hold the fuck up. You can't just gloss over the fact that guy just noted in his pants and he was yelling, you just had a mental. It's a mental breakdown, orgasm and your pants during a mental breakdown. I didn't do it. He did it that you should document that. That's more present than bending a spoon. I should've said, yeah, that's my psychic ability working right there. I mean, that doesn't make any sense. So he tells you this as an ejaculation. His pants. He in front of everybody. He says it's a demonic ejaculation. East. Straight up says I added the Arctic ejaculations. Seems like a together guy with definitely got a head on his shoulders. Was a producer for us. I think it was BBC, if I'm not mistaken. He was doing a documentary for them, so yeah. Well, he's fucking crazy. Huh? He finished. He finished a documentary, so.

Speaker 2:          00:56:02       Oh, well yeah, definitely. It wasn't crazy then. As long as you finish this documentary. Well, he believed in psychic phenomena. He believed that the demon made them come in his pants. That is true, yes. As show it to you as to whether he believed it was a demon or not. I don't know. Demons. Demonic. Ejaculate. When your parents, what do you like? Pull your shirt down. Like get out of there. I think I wouldn't dating that demon. I mean probably the price to pay that. You wouldn't want that. Don't need a girlfriend. Donate a woman at that point. Grants when disagreement and yellow. It's a good looking demon. So he was saying that randy was evil because if it wasn't for Randy's rules that he would not. He would have got this on tape. But how dumb does that guy have to be? I mean that is so silly.

Speaker 2:          00:56:46       Like this is a person that's supposed to be discovering or at least investigating psychic phenomena and he doesn't understand that investigator, right? He's a producer. He's a producer who believes in this phenomena. Hence he wants to do a documentary on psychic phenomena. Has an interest in it. He already believes in it, so he's not, he's not as bad as the, the Paris psychologists who are supposed to be using proper science because I'm often asked, is it right? Is it ethical that you full scientists in the name of science? Right? So this becomes this whole big question like, uh, we will be unethical to do that. Um, and my aunts that did that in a minute, who the fuck asked you that question? A lot of scientists say that fools. Well, and it's a thing, right? Because if you think that they do, it's like, yeah, if you ask a guy who's a thief to break into your house and then he breaks into your house in a method that with a method that you didn't anticipate, is that unethical?

Speaker 2:          00:57:39       It's no different than what you're doing. You're, you're a mentalist. You're, you're a person who is trying to trick them. They have all these rules setup to make sure that you don't trick them. So they know for a fact that what you're doing is psychic energy. But if you don't really have psychic powers and you absolutely don't, of course you're going to fucking trick them. The idea that you would trick them and that would somehow or another be unethical. No, you just played the game better than them. Well, this was, this was the point, right? It was this thing of like, uh, my thing was, should you be taking money to investigate this phenomena under false pretenses because you're not using proper science if you're using proper science. I won't get away with any of this. Had you have followed brandy's rules, we would not have got away with any of this.

Speaker 2:          00:58:18       I mean, we had very strict ethical rules. If you ask us, if we magicians, we have to say yes. If you ask us if we're working for the amazing randy with him, you have to say yes. You know, so we have all these rules. Those old TV shows where like if someone was an undercover cop and say, are you a cop? They have to tell you that they don't really have to do that, that that's they don't know. That's the only premise they use really shows a damn it. Have you asked a cop, are you a cop? And they go, no, and then you buy the heroin off him. Them still go to jail. Wow. Yeah, I remember that. I'm going to go buy heroin or anything, but you know there may be something else. I'll say something about a gun. Yeah. There's very few people that have told me a story where I go, damn, I wish I was there for that story, but the nuts and the pants and blaming a demon, I really do wish I was there. I really wish I was there for that guy. I like to be in the room and I'd be like, hold up. Everything else. Just going to get put on the back burner here. Nowadays it'd be like, hold on, let me get my smartphone out. I got to take a picture on instagram. Demon and why are you showing me? You're just so parents. How much do you have to come? And your pants were chosen. The

Speaker 3:          00:59:21       outside, Jesus Christ. We was scared though. Like kids like we will, we will kill you. So probably towards the end 19 would've been about 1981. Nineteen 82. That means I'm 21, 22, somewhere in that area. You could probably still kick [inaudible] ass. Yeah. But keep in mind I was also a kid who was very like socially and like not. I mean I'm the kid in the back of the class when the heavy coat on in the middle of winter. Was that the first time a guy that ever came in his pants and then pointed to it in front of me as well? For me? Yes. That's never happened my whole life. I can never say I've ever had that happen. Know ever. I like to go to my grave without anybody ever nothing in their parents. And then pointing down, go look at Damon made me do this.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       Or you have an excuse now if it ever happens to you. Well now the problem is millions of people have heard this and so they'll just scan me. So I'm going to run into people. Everywhere you go, you guys are going to pull their shirt. He goes to work at a comedy comedy. Be 10 guys, stand up with a puddle pointing down with a little bit. It's going to be great day. Maybe not in my pants. Did you bring nails? Man? I did. I brought Nelson. I got. I got some stuff. Maybe we might get to some of that stuff. I have it. I have stuff here in case. So you felt bad that you trick this dummy with Mike and I really like. We were scared because we realized the kind of. He was unhinged. Not that we realized the kind of power we had over these people at that point it was just them, but it's like there's another whole thing going.

Speaker 3:          01:00:51       This whole psychological thing going on here because they want to believe so badly. Really messing with people's heads, right? I mean we're really. And what's going to happen? We come out and say this is all a fraud and fake. So we sat down random. He said, look, we want to come out and we want to end it now. And he was like, you know what? We got a TV show. We're going to be coming up in a couple of months. Let's just wait and expose it then. It's not gonna make any difference. So we, we hung out until that time. I mean, there was a peripheral, you know, scientists and there was one guy with any of that birth or swartz. I didn't want to do anything with him because he kind of came into the scene at the end of working with the Mac lab, but he kept pushing and pushing and pushing and he lived in New Jersey.

Speaker 3:          01:01:29       So finally I went out there and this guy kind of believed in everything it was. It was. He wrote a whole book called the, uh, tanning, the poltergeists of the poultry taming Tammy. I mean, the guys you can find it online as well. And it was a booklet and it was a, it was for the psychosis psychosis dynamic, uh, something like as a, something of dentistry and medicine, but it was an actual medical journal and it was all about his stuff that he had done with me. Um, but this guy believed in everything. Like, he handed me a camera one time, uh, uh, a video camera and he said, look, I've, uh, I, I knew a lady that could take pictures of the sky and when I get the film and you know, I get it developed and I look at it and I play it, you can see Ufo is in the sky that you couldn't see with the naked eye.

Speaker 3:          01:02:17       Can you do that? Now? I was one of these kids that I was just like, I would say I could do anything and everything. Even in the laboratory I would say I could do anything. And um, so he hands me the camera. I start taking pictures of the parking lot in the sky and everything and I hand it back to him. So he gets it developed when he gets developed. This is vacation footage and then there's him handing me the camera. You see all of a sudden this weird kind of blog. And in the blob you see a woman's torso and thigh. You see a woman giving birth to a baby. You see Jesus Christ, you see all these images and he, uh, he, he, he, he pointed them out to me. I could see them as well when you actually pointed Aurora Shark test, that kind of thing.

Speaker 3:          01:02:57       Sort of. Yes, because this guy's affording psychologists. All right, so we'll, all I had simply done was I, I didn't know what to do. I was just making stuff up as I went along. So I spat on the front of the camera and that Blob as it changes and as it dried, almost like looking at clouds, you could see all these different shapes. And so he believed that this was psychic phenomena. This was something that was happening. Now I got to give the Mac lab credit because when Peter Phillips said, saw it, he said, yeah, it looks like a blob of water and, and, but, but, but birth always said to him, he said, yeah, but it's what's in the blog that's important. It's what you see inside that's important. He called me up one day. I lived in Pennsylvania. Then he called me up one day and said, you did it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:38       You did it. And I said, what did I do? He said, well, there's this jar, and there was this one jar that he would have silverware and things inside, and they were all sealed and he would have sitting up on a shelf and it's 7:00 every night I was supposed to concentrate and never did, but I was supposed to concentrate from Pennsylvania and get the try to get the stuff to ben long distance. And he calls me up. He said, you know that Joe, you concentrate every night. Yep, I know that you are. He said, you did it. And I'm thinking, damn, I'm good. Oh, what the hell happened here? He says, well, you actually missed it, but you hit the radiator and it's leaking all over the floor. So he believed that's how much this guy believed in all this stuff and gave me credit.

Speaker 3:          01:04:15       But when you read it, here's the interesting thing, right? You know what I mean? He stuck electrodes on my head. He did all kinds of psychological tests and the psychological tests turned out that if I wasn't psychic, I would be crazy. So those tests, his, his psychological tests for me show that if I wasn't like psychic I would be crazy, but I was asking and answering the questions like a psychic, like a psychic wooden. So Berthold Schwartz was a, another character and at the very end when we came out and said this was all a fraud, it was all a fake. Berthold was the one that said amongst a couple of other people, but he was the primary one that said, look, they say they were lying, then how do we know they're not lying now? Oh good. Which is an interesting question, right? But my answer, because I can show you how I did those things.

Speaker 3:          01:04:59       Even the Mac lab, they, we had a conference in the time life building in New York where we came clean. He said it was all a hoax we got up there and if you can ever find footage of this online, it's great because randy introduces us and it's time life building. Everybody's there. I mean, you know, discover magazine, psychology today. Uh, you know, the New York Times, everybody, everybody from all over the world there. And they think Randy's found two psychics that are genuine and we get up there and we demonstrate stuff. And then Randy's, you know, somebody asks the question, you know, how do you do it? And Randy looks at us, he says, you want to answer Mike? So Mike Edwards walks over, he says, Yep. He said, it's a hoax, it's a trick. And then I say, yeah, for the last four years we've been fooling the scientists and that's when we came out and you see that mouse open.

Speaker 3:          01:05:42       I like, oh my God, you know, it's, it's just, it's great. Great footage when you could see it because it's that moment, the scientists would not answer that phone until we spoke to them. And I have the recording, I have jay had the recording of where I ended up calling them back and I'm recording the conversation and I, he says, we've heard this rumor that you guys are working with Randy and that you're not real. And I say, what do you think? And he says to me, that can't be true. It has to be real. And I go, well, unfortunately it is true. And he starts asking, well, how did you do this? And then I tell him how did you do that? And I tell him and he's constantly asking about this and that, trying to find one thing, one thing that he could hold onto.

Speaker 3:          01:06:29       And there was some little things because a lot of times when you have real information and you know you're going to be to do something, you take chances and sometimes those chances hit as well. So you can't explain that. That's just the odds, right? Yeah. So he wanted desperately to believe. And the thought was that maybe you had psychic powers but you didn't want people to know you at psyche power so that you trick them. And then you were lying afterwards to conceal your power. Right. He also mentioned that Randy May have paid us off to life for him too. So yeah. Well he was probably devastated, right? Because as a scientist, I'm sure he was. He, he caught a guy that I knew in Washington, Pennsylvania where I lived, and I think the guys still lives there now, but it had been the name of Joe newsome and Joe was an escape artist and I knew Joe now, keep in mind when I was doing all this, I really didn't know any magicians.

Speaker 3:          01:07:20       In fact, even when I started out, I didn't know there was an area of magic call mentalism, which is doing, you know, taking your five senses to create the illusion of a sixth sense. You not a psychic, you're using tricks using psychology, verbal, nonverbal communication, but mostly magic to create these tricks. All right. I knew, I didn't know that. I just knew there were people that con people with tricks to make them think they were psychic. That's all that I knew at that time. But I met a few magicians and one of them was Joe newsome. So birth Schwartz caught up, Joe. He said, why would, why would steve do this? Why would I do this? Um, and Joe says, I don't know, but I could open the locks with my mind. Joe Proceeded, which I thought was a really asshole thing to do. Joe Proceeded to work with him for years until birth old, died and birth will believe that Joe has psychic powers and I called Joe up one time. I said, why you doing this? This guy has been through enough. You know, we've already expose it as a fraud, as a fake, you know, why are you doing this to that guy? And rather than answer the question, he pretended

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       that he was his brother that had answered the phone, but I know Joe and I knew Joe and I knew it was his brother doesn't sound anything like him. So isn't it possible that some people like, look, some people like playing tennis. Some people like fucking with people, right? He likes fucking with people that sport probably. Yeah. He probably gets a hold of a mouse, doesn't kill it, so let's it crawl away a little bit. Then swats it and brings it back and that's it. Survive. I mean that's probably what he was doing. Well sometimes a mouse likes that, right? No, I don't think the mouse over like I was talking to my friend. No, I was talking to my friend tires. Right. So there's this thing of this enzyme that cats have. I can't think of what it talks to a plasma enzyme. It's a parasite.

Speaker 2:          01:08:59       Parasites. Then that goes into some nice where they think it's okay to have fun to play with a cat or a more complicated than that, but it actually turns their sexual reward system sideways where the cat is the. When the cat urinates the smell of cat urine, gets them excited and actually makes the mouse aroused and it removes all fear of, uh, of the cat cat. Yeah. Because the only way that toxoplasmosis gone d, which is the parasite can reproduce, is inside the cat's gut. So the cat has to eat the mouse or the rat in order for this parasite to reproduce. And then the reproduction. The thing is it doesn't affect the cat's behavior, which is very strange, but it does affect people. It does affect people. And it does affect rats and mice. Yeah. Do you think that's why we have cat ladies?

Speaker 2:          01:09:51       Oh yeah. You think it affects those crazy bitches, you think? You said it doesn't affect, it doesn't affect people, but do you think it does affect? It doesn't affect. Cat's got. Gotcha. The cat's behavior seems to be the same, exactly the same, but it definitely affects people. It makes people more impulsive. There's a bunch of weird correlations. There's a recent study that showed that entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial behavior is often connected with toxoplasmosis infection. Wow. People are more risk. They're more inclined to take risks and take chances. It's also, there's a disproportionate number of motorcycle victims, uh, of crashes that have toxoplasmosis infection. Really? Yeah. This came from Robert Sapolsky, his work. He's a professor at Stanford. We had a chance to interview him. Fascinating guy. Yeah. Well, a lot of his, uh, his work he's done on toxoplasmosis. You think there's other, a lot of other things like that that we don't realize that affect human behavior?

Speaker 2:          01:10:46       There could very well be. I mean, there's a bunch of different parasites that people get and you know, there was another guy, God, what's his name? Hortense out of University of Houston. Peter Hotez dammit. Anyway, he's an infectious disease expert who specializes in same television show that I worked with you and he said that people that live in jungle, literally 100 percent percent of them, 100 percent are infected with parasites while various parasites, some documented, some undocumented. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And many of them control behavior. Yeah. It's fascinating. There's some of them that are really creepy, like there's one, there's an aquatic worm that talks at grasshopper and drowning so that it can give birth, so it literally gets into the grasshoppers brain rewires it's brain, tells the grasshopper to jump into the water so it can come out of its body and exist in the water. It's amazing when you think about that, right?

Speaker 2:          01:11:47       How those things have developed to be able to do exactly specifically what they, certain things need them to do. So that's something else can benefit from it. Is that what his name is? Because I wanted to get a benefit. What? Trying to find it out. I couldn't cut down it that way. I think it's Peter Hotez. Ortez Shit. Sorry. University of Houston. Um, I can find it pretty sure. Pretty sure anyway, so yeah, I mean your friend probably just like fucking with people and you'd probably feel like this guy's a dummy. I'm just gonna. Keep fucking with these dummies. Have you ever do it? Because I wanted to. Oh, I know you did that. I thought I was doing the right thing and I didn't realize that these people are going to become my friends. I'm eating with them every day. They've got these lives, you know, and I care about people and at some point I know that I'm going to have to come out and it's going to be devastating for them.

Speaker 2:          01:12:37       You know, he did it for years, got tenure at the university. He's going to look like an idiot at the end of this and that wasn't my purpose of doing it much bigger picture. Yes, I get it, but that is what he is. No, no, I agree. And that's what I'm saying. There's a much bigger picture. I would do the same thing again. I would just protect myself emotionally, I think more than I did then. So you went to become friends with. I would not become close friends with. I wouldn't share a lot of my life with them. I wouldn't want to learn about their life. I'd want to keep it much more maybe than you dragged it on for so long, you know? Maybe if you just did it over a couple of days, no way to do that. I mean, we would have days where we would do nothing.

Speaker 2:          01:13:18       Like we literally sat in the lab and nothing would happen for an entire. That's fucking commitment, man. Do that shit over four years. Well, here's the thing, right? It's, it's a bit misleading because it's 180 hours total and what that means is we'll coming out on holidays were coming out on weekends would coming out on that. You're extending this project for a long time and we weren't making money at it. You know, there was a podium that paid for our food, but that's about it. Yeah. You were just doing it for the procedure. I lost money because I had to take time off work. Yeah. It's, I think it's what you did as a good thing. Yeah. Document because you show that even scientists can be tricked if they're not really following the scientific method and that was the way to do it because there were even some psychologist who said, look, if you think you can infiltrate a laboratory, go ahead and do it.

Speaker 2:          01:14:04       So we were doing things in accordance with what some of the psychological as a psychologist we actually saying we should do for sure. Like that's the whole game. The game is you're supposed to be. They're supposed to try to find out if you're tricking them. So they should be assuming you're tricking them. Yep. So they're not assuming you're tricking them, they're tricking themselves and that is part of the problem with psychics. Like I had a friend of mine went to a psychic and they're like, oh my God. He knew all about my grandma. I go, don't you know about your grandma? I go, if this motherfucker really knows psychic, he really knows his psychic power. They're going to tell you some shit you don't know. Telling you things about your life. You already know I don't need anybody to tell me about my life. Now that's a good thing, right?

Speaker 2:          01:14:45       That's all they're doing and there's ways to get that info from you without you realizing what I was saying this to my friend, he did not want to listen to me. He wanted to believe so strong and he definitely didn't want to believe they got tricked. This is part of the problem with scammers. Have you ever seen some of those scammers, those Nigerian scammers, and get these poor, lonely Melina to think that women are waiting for them in Europe? There was a terrible television show. I mean terrible in that. It was so sad. This one guy flew to Europe twice to be with this woman and every time he flew there she had something come up and meet him. It was devastating. She couldn't meet him and he. He kept going back and his daughter was saying, I can't convince him that this is a scam.

Speaker 2:          01:15:27       He really believes this woman's waiting for him. He's never heard this woman's voice. She says she can't talk on the phone, but she, he, she sends pictures and he really believes strongly. You know, it's, it's really sad. I, I, that's why I find like in like Penn, Penn Jillette gave me one of the biggest compliments that I've ever had actually at one point, um, he had seen me work and his wife had seen me work. Emily had seen me work and emily came and she said, yeah, Penn said that if we didn't know you were not psychic from that demonstration from watching a show, you were the most convincing psychic we've ever seen. Well, I said to, yeah. So the same thing to Duncan when you did that performance for us on television. I'm like, that is the craziest shit if you weren't so adamant that what you were doing was a trick. Right. And Doug was like, dude, what if he's fucking with man? He really is.

Speaker 2:          01:16:21       Dunkin tends to, um, you know, he, he has a thirst for the fantastic. Yeah. So for him, which is nice that you can play off of that, that it's, it's a good thing to have. Uh, yeah. I, um, my, my house, it showed for that exact reason, the show I'm doing in Rochester, it's called telepathy and the first half usually it's gonna be, I don't actually have to hats, but normally I do. Normally it's a two hour show, but I've had to cut it down to an hour show and the first half was always me coming out talking about telepathy. What is telepathy? What did Einstein, he believed it was radio waves. Marie Curie believed that it was, telepathy was a real way that he even wrote the foreword to a book called telepathy. So yeah, yeah, he believed it was a real thing. He believed your mind give out radio waves that other people actually picked up a Sigmund Freud believed it was related, a dream state, you know, there was all these different third theories.

Speaker 2:          01:17:11       I mean, the word was coined in, I think it was 18, 42 by uh, Frederick Myers and he believes certain things about telepathy. So there was all these different things. Um, uh, I start off a Conan doyle who wrote Sherlock Holmes, you know, most rational character in literature. He believed that with spirits all around us, it could pluck a thought out of one person's mind and actually put it in another. So he believed all prognostication. All these things have to do this, had to do with spiritualism. So there's all these people. I mean the US government, you know, about Star Gate, they gave $20,000,000 in the seventies going on into the nineties to study and find out if this stuff had any practical military applications on these type of things. So remote viewing, tell it. Yeah, well that's where remote viewing came out. The other thing, stargate not cured me of that television show did try to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:17:56       You did that. I think you actually did that with the, with Dj growthy on there as well, so. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think he was part of that, but of that Dj, me and Dj both did better. Just faking it then. That's great. We just made a bunch of shit up and drew some stick figures. That's how that can be the tower. This is the tower is about. Actually it was a man, but it looks like a tower. Right? There was the one guy that's famous for remote viewing. I interviewed him as well. What is his name? Yeah, you say his name. I'll know it. I'm not bell all the time. They'll be on there for hours and hours and hours and met him and I was like, is this guy fucking with me? Yeah. And he was explaining how he worked for the US government, how they found Osama bin Ladin fucking bonkers somewhere else that, that doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          01:18:45       Fun Guy. Yeah. Was telling me about his hot Russian girlfriend. I was like, all right, tell me more about that. Let's go that direction. Can I remote viewer? I think you put it in my head right now. Can I see which. Oh, she's in the bathtub to be more having a demon ejaculation. And so anyway, since that time I've, I've gone after many different things. Um, Peter Popoff, the evangelist said he was getting the word of God. Randy came to Houston in 1986. The earpiece in? Yeah, I found the earpiece. Oh, you found that it was me. Yeah. So Randy was writing an article, I think it was Hustler magazine. It was one of those magazines on evangelists, evangelists. It was a good place to hide something. It was one of the things. It may not have been hustled, so I don't want you to quote me on that.

Speaker 2:          01:19:32       That house did a lot of those and that's what I'm saying. I didn't Penthouse, but I don't think it plays a lot. I think it was hustling, but I could be wrong is one of the ones that people actually read because the girls never take their panties off. So you get bored with just looking at now though it didn't. They go back to. Well they don't know they were. They went to looking after. They did not do it at all. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Show amazing willpower. Sorry. They went to the key needs or underwear. They stopped taking their clothes off. But then sales inexplicably tank. It's so strange. Those articles, they did have good articles in playboy,

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       had interviews. They had a lot of groundbreaking on through the years. Buddy of mine had a book of all the different playboy interviews. Over the years, and I was like, well, I have some good stuff. Yeah, so randy. Yeah, Randy for Hustler. Yeah. Writing for us though on evangelist. He said, Hey, do you want to come see this evangelists with me? I'm like, yeah, sure, I'll come. So went there and it was about 10,000 people. It's downtown, Big Auditorium, Houston, huge auditorium. You know, all these people sitting around and a pop off comes out on stage. He starts saying he's getting the word of God. He's telling people their names, information, who their doctors are, what their ailments are, and he's. He starts healing. People have cancer. He starts healing people of blindness. People walking again, and it was really, really emotionally for me. I tears in my eyes, but I knew that was all bullshit, but I had to news bullshit and crying.

Speaker 3:          01:20:57       It can you get this whole fucking life. Like when you see a little kid crying and running down the aisle, you know, you, you want to get angry, but at the same time it's like, it's just so emotional. It's just the. You get caught up in this whole thing. It's just new, so he asked for people to collect money. He's just asking random people, come up, grab a bucket, go collect money. I got down there. I remember I was like the 15th bucket. I got my bucket. I walk around, I get checks. I got probably about, I don't know how much. 10 grand, 20 grand. I don't know. You know what I've got? I mean money. First of all, getting money. Then you've got to. I'm think I'm done. He said, nope. Yeah, okay. Once you got to go back out and collect checks and now we're going out getting checks in the bucket and then it's like go out, get sealed offerings and people are dropping envelopes in there with like watches, rings and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          01:21:40       As I come back, I hand the bucket up to pop off and I look up and I noticed that he's got a piece of plastic in his ear. I go back to randy and I say, Randy, I said, look, either this man of God, God doesn't like him enough to heal him and he's got a hearing aid or something else is going on. I don't know what, but something else is going on and I think that's how he's getting information. And Randy was like, no, he's using mnemonics. Mnemonics that basically memory systems. All right. I, you, I have to use a lot of mnemonics to memorize things because otherwise I have major issues and I know a lot about mnemonics. You either memorize a lot of bad things about a few things. Oh you memorize a few things about a lot of things, but you don't memorize a lot of things about a lot of things.

Speaker 3:          01:22:20       And he was memorizing a lot of things about a lot of things. If that was the case, I said, I don't think so. So they went out to the next pet, pop off a congregation thing when she was in San Francisco, got a friend of ours from a Alec, Jason, I think his name is, uh, from a WHO's an electronics engineer and that was everything about electronics. And he brought this little scanner and dressed up as a security guard hanging out in the back. And he was scared to death he was going to get called. Nobody questioned him. He's there in a security outfit and he scans all the frequencies ahead of time and he blocks out every one of those frequencies that are known frequencies. The moment pop off hits the stage, a brand new frequency pops up and turns out, I think it was a 37 point.

Speaker 3:          01:23:05       I can tell you in just a second here. It was A. Yeah. Wait, was that the frequency that he was on was? Yep. I thought it was right. Yeah. 30 nine point seven megahertz. That's what God broadcasts on and it sounds an awful lot like Peter popoff wife. So what we did was we taped all this and went to the Johnny Carson show. This is how long ago that was. Now on this night show with Johnny Carson. Randy takes it on the tonight show and keep in mind that I'm pop off with tape every single one of his shows and sort of edit it real time as well. You put them on television. Yeah, it will put them all on television. This is how we make tons of. I mean they were. They had a, a monthly budget. I think it was like $550,000 every single month, you know, that, that, that, that, that was a working budget, that that's not the money.

Speaker 3:          01:23:49       They will actually make it. So God knows how much. So that's how much they were spending so much they were spending. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So God, what a dirty business. Yeah. It's so dirty. It's so dirty to just lie to people like that. I, if I would make a great evangelists if I wasn't ethical, there are times like, Oh God, you know, but I just couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. So on the tonight show they play, they play the footage that they have from his TV show. They play all that and then they. Oh, and this was the one time that Johnny always wanted to know everything that was going to happen. Like she didn't want any surprises, but his staff said, no, you, you want to be surprised by this, trust this. So sure enough they play that footage and then they play the footage with pop offs wife and she's saying things like pd.

Speaker 3:          01:24:31       The first thing she says, PD, nod your head if you can hear me, because if you don't, we're going to have trouble tonight. He nods his head as he's talking, you know, doing this whole event gelical thing. Um, and uh, then she starts saying, oh, there's a live one up in the back. She's got cancer in her breast and make her run up and down the island, shake those breaths, you know, it's just always like re. And there's a lot of nasty stuff. Some of that stuff we couldn't play on this night show, but we showed enough. And so just a disdain the marketing of these people. She actually had breast cancer and she's telling that these people do these real elements that all these people, well, almost real elements. I'll get to that in a second because we sent some stitches in and uh, so yeah, just nasty, nasty stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:25:13       But anyway, the stuff we showed him the tonight show, Johnny sits there and he never, he didn't like to edit it shows either, but he had to edit this because a moment that came on Johnny's like, Oh shit. And you couldn't say shit on TV back then. And so we had to edit that out at that point and he says like, do they know about this? And like, nope, they do now. And at first pop off, try to say that we, we, we, uh, we hired actors to be his wife. And then when it was obvious that we didn't, he then came out and says, I thought everybody knew that I use that to enhance the word of God. And it took a long time for him to go onto that. Here's, here's the crappy thing about this, right when I was there, he's doing stuff like telling people to throw their medications up on stage.

Speaker 3:          01:25:53       You don't need them. God's going to take care of, you know, imagine somebody throws up some digitalis pills or something they really, truly need and think God's going to heal them. So people do die from these things. And he was using a lot of other tricks. I, Oh, I'm part of the way he was getting the information was this, right? So people fill out prayer cards ahead of time and they put them in these boxes in the back of the room when nobody's really paying attention, the boxes get switched out. So all those prayer cards with all this information goes backstage. So the wife and she's able to send that information to him. Another thing, she would come out on stage, she would come out, people come to these things for hours and hours ahead of time, like literally and they leave the hospital on carts and everything else and she would walk and she said, hi, I'm Mrs Popoff go.

Speaker 3:          01:26:33       I hope my husband gets to you tonight. You know, where are you from? Oh, that's nice. Well, what's wrong with you? Oh I'm so well. I'll pray for you. And she gets all this information again. She'd go back. She had a big tape recorder in her purse and she would write that information down. Another one was what I call like the Kathryn Kuhlman trick and Catherine Coleman was an evangelist way, way back who had all these great, great little like scam trick things. And what they do is they wait for somebody to come walk in with a cane and then they can walk but not well, and they're using a cane. They walk up to them and say, you know what? Wouldn't you be much more comfortable in a wheelchair and we can put you up right up front. You'll be right next to the reverend. Who's going to say no to that?

Speaker 3:          01:27:10       So they get pushed up in the wheelchair. And as I pushed them along, they said, well, you're from WHO's your doctor? You know what's wrong with getting all this information? Go back out, write the information down and giving Mrs Popoff. So the wheelchair sitting there, reverent comes out. At some point he can look at that person. He didn't, he said so name. And he says, we've never talked before. We've never met before, have we? Because they haven't. It was the usher that was pushing him down to gut that info. He says, you know, God says you can be healed. Now. God said, I'm getting from God that you can't walk. Is that right? And the guy sitting there, he's thinking, this is a man of God, right? So I'm not contradicting him. And he must mean never be at a walk properly again. That's what he's saying.

Speaker 3:          01:27:46       He's saying that my doctor says I can never walk properly again. So he doesn't contradict him. He says, I say you can. God says you can stand up. The man stands up. Well, that's your first miracle because everybody else, their perception is this, guys in that wheelchair cannot walk. He said, take a few steps that it takes a few steps. You got that beat, it's war, right? So now you've got the emotion going even more. Because here's a man that couldn't even walk. He stood and now he walked, pop off, then goes and gets in the wheelchair and sits in it. He says, walk to the back of the wheelchair and the guy hobbles to the back of the wheelchair. He says, push me. And the guy pushes him. Real miracle, right? But think about it. That will chair is now acting like a fricken walker.

Speaker 3:          01:28:27       And then the great climax of the whole piece of this trick is he takes the wheelchair, puts it back where it is, and he says to him, now that's your wheelchair, meaning Joe, like if you got up right now, walked across the room and said, Yo, that's your chair. You'd say, yes, will it actually is your jail. You own it. But I mean in normal circumstances I say you were in my studio. You'd go, yes, doesn't mean that your chair, it just means it's where you're sitting in that moment. So the permits and sits down and you've seen this whole miracle. So he's got all these tricks like that. The old trick of one leg is longer than the other and you make them both the same size. Also, people get caught up in the moment and they're on television. They want it to be real.

Speaker 3:          01:28:59       And the good, I think an interesting. That's a lot of things, but I don't think so. In this case, I think this is more of a religious thing that people truly believe. And when you have. It's like when I was talking tongues, when I was yelling, you know, I've got all this stuff, me and I got all this adrenaline flowing through my body. When you get caught up in it, it's like when I was watching it, you know, I'm getting caught up. I'm having all this reaction in my body despite the fact I know it's all bullshit. I'm still having this, this entire reaction, you know, it's, it's, you know, mediums to me. The worst scum out there right now are the mediums and why do I say that? Because they're taking advantage of a person in a vulnerable moment in their life and they're doing it for that long game.

Speaker 3:          01:29:36       They're also doing it for money and a lot of people will say, well, then making them feel good. You know what? I can give crack to a junkie. It doesn't mean it's good for him, right? The grieving process is a natural part of the state that you have to go through to stay with the living. We had a very good friend whose son died of cancer, 10 years old, died of cancer. She's understanding he has this huge gaping hole, right, is huge, gaping hole, which she's just feeling sad. She's upset, she needs to fill it with something. Normally you turn to your family for those things, but she met. She met a medium who convinced the she could talk to her dead son, so she stopped talking to her two living daughters. She stopped talking to her husband, she started talking to the meat, even talking to her dead son, almost ended up with a divorce, almost lost her entire life as a result, and this happens all the time and it is so, so sad and dirty, very dirty people on long island medium you ever watched.

Speaker 3:          01:30:29       So Theresa Caputo and the worst part is the networks that edit the stuff to make it look even better. If they don't give a fuck, they're just trying to make money and just try to make money. That's all they don't care about. Somehow or another feel like they're not a part of the scam. I mean, they're literally committing fraud. They aren't there. No, I agree. They're perpetrating the fraud. Well, the network is not involved with what it is, is a production company. The production company is bringing it to the network, but the network should know the process and knows what's going on. They know it's bullshit, but it's like, you know what? I was going to get ratings. It's going to do this. Let's promote it, let's push it. You know, they show up on set on Psi Phi and the network. They didn't want me just debunking everything.

Speaker 3:          01:31:11       No, and I had to tell them, I said, the problem is everything's bullshit. Yeah. It's not that I'm trying to debunk everything. We're just really looking at it. Yeah, everything's bullshit. Well, it's why in my show I started to go on this a little bit ago that showed telepathy where I talk about telepathy and what it is and everything else, but as I'm doing it, I'm performing and there's a part in that show where I feel really, really dirty and I feel really, really bad, but I feel like I have to do it. And I actually talked to some people's dead relatives in that show and it's like the most despicable, horrible thing and it makes me want to cry every time I do it, but it's because in the second half of the show I go, what is telepathy? Well, I think I know what it is.

Speaker 3:          01:31:50       I think it's a, a, a subset of magic. I think it's a form of entertainment and a very cruel form of entertainment. I know I played with emotions if any of you here this, but how else can I convince you on an emotional level? And on a logical level that is bullshit. Because here's the thing, right? It's like your friend. They've had this one experience that's an emotional experience meeting the psychic and the psychic telling them, if you tell them, hey, well I got this friend band check, they could do that same thing for you. He's going, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, but this is, you know, or if I do it, say Bennett checks are real soft, they train us to meet up and then I do it. And he goes, wow, that God's real. Then now you say it's bullshit, now they'll think a little bit and go, well, you know what?

Speaker 3:          01:32:31       I had that same emotional experience. I had that same feeling. Maybe maybe I'll look at it. My job, I feel he's never to break down a person's belief systems, you know, you can believe whatever you want, you know, that's fine. So long as you're not hurting anybody else, I'm Kinda sorta okay with it. But the big thing is the problem that I have is with the people that have taken advantage of those people's beliefs, cause it's always wolves in sheep's clothing. They're taking advantage of people go down these side streets and there's these houses, there's little houses that are sided houses where people live in them and some of them do, like you look at those houses, they're like fricking like beautiful. And they look like these people must be making money like huge money somehow unless they're laundering money or something on the side as well.

Speaker 3:          01:33:11       I mean there's enough people that believe in. Unfortunately they're good at it. They just hustle people and yeah, it's a weird legal scam. I mean to, in order to like the government's constantly shutting down cults and all sorts of things that are not legit that they find to be dangerous, but they somehow or another allow people, like some of them had got arrested recently for scamming someone out of hundreds of thousands of dollars and it was the same sort of a thing. She was a psychic and she was saying that she needed all this money for. Right, for some fucking Mino about where I'll frames, right? No. So he was like, he, he, I think he like, he, he was like a multi millions and millions of dollars and there was a long scan that went on for a long time. I think it was a, what was it?

Speaker 3:          01:33:57       I think I ever down there somewhere, I don't know where. But anyway, round frames, he was, uh, he, he basically grew trees and replanted trees and old trees and everything he said made millions and millions off this. So there was this lady, uh, he got scammed for five point $5,000,000 over the course of a long period of time, but it all started out with the, he met this lady and a psychic bookstore, a, she gave him a bit of a reading and through the reading she found out that his dad wasn't well and she said that she had taken care of her dad through hospice and everything, but she had actually done it herself. She ended up moving in with him. She ended up getting him because she was doing readings, convinced him he, she was psychic. She ended up getting him buying him like at $950,000 home, uh, which will all these investments.

Speaker 3:          01:34:41       She ended up taking over all of his finances. She moved in with him romantically. No, no, this is the weird part, right. So she didn't, she was rude in as the caretaker for the, for the father. Um, but in the process of all this, she's getting, she's now taking over his finances. She's convinced that they're going bankrupt. They got to pay the taxes. That tax money is getting funneled through her, gets deeper than this. One day he's at the bus station. There's this blonde hair, beautiful girl with an English accent that comes on over and she starts giving him a reading and he ends up marrying or thinks he actually marries us. Go at some point. Turns out this goal is the daughter of the other woman. Her name is portia. And what did they call their kid? They called their kid a Giorgio Armani. Now.

Speaker 3:          01:35:28       Now, now here's the thing, right? They had a kid together, but he thought he had a kid with her. It turns out the kid was a cousin's baby that she brought in the House and acted like she had the baby. Wait a minute. No, no. You can look this all up online. It's all online. I like being. Well, she used the baby bump thing, you know, and then she acted like she had a second kid, but she lost that child and everything else. And the only way they got caught is because the boyfriend of, I think the mother, I think it was. We're now in the same day and bought these these cars for like a million but box almost close to that, you know, that he just went out and spent the money. So the US government started coming, come in and say, wait, what's going on here?

Speaker 3:          01:36:06       How is this going down? And it all came to light up, but as. Yeah, yeah, Ralph rains, so I want to believe Shit, you know, they just want to believe and it's a strange thing. I wonder what that is. Do you think that that's some sort of. There's some sort of an evolutionary aspect to thought were like to find things that are hidden or secrets is a part of our thirst for innovation or a thirst to. To invent things or to. To figure out problems more to, to, to not be deceived. I think it's part of survival, right? You're always looking for that next evolution of what, what's gonna work and if we could read minds that would help us in our lives, right? It would say it was a lot of pain. If I know that she's really cheating on me or she's lying to me or he's lying to me or, but it's not just a psychic energy that's like ghosts and all the other stuff too.

Speaker 3:          01:36:57       It all seems connected, but it, it is that almost evolutionary to say I think we always strive to better ourselves and to get that kind of knowledge and if there's a possibility, there's an afterlife. Wow, what does that really mean for me as a human being and sort of the evolutionary scale now I'm just thinking about things that I do in a very different manner. Right? It's also like this weird desire that people have to know things that are hidden. Those. One of the reasons why that's the conspiracies. Yeah. Right. I mean, that is part of survival. It's like, Hey, I wonder what's behind that cave right there. Oh, I wonder what's over the top of that mountain. Are there any animals over there that I can hunt in that field whatsoever there? Where's a better place to fish right now? Where's the better place to hunt?

Speaker 3:          01:37:40       And it's all about survival I think. I think really on some level it's a really screwed up thing that's in our head pattern that helps us sort of survived. You know, you talk about people wanting to believe things. You know, there was a guy, there was a Russian psychic. He Frankel, I think his name was. Now imagine this Joe. So you're a conductor on a train, right? And you're going down some tracks with a train and you see a guy in a white suit just looking at the side, looking down towards you, coming down the tracks, puts down a briefcase, steps right in front of the train, stares at the train, puts his hand up in sort of a stop motion, but you can't stop car. Hit Him and knock him. You killed the guy. He's in a million pieces of whatever happened to him and actual real guy.

Speaker 3:          01:38:20       They opened up the briefcase and inside there's a letter says, I stopped a bicycle. I stopped the car, I stopped a street car, and now I'm going to do the ultimate thing. I'm going to stop a train. This was a psychic who believed he had powers. Now my thinking on this, I'm going, first of all, I'm going, Yay. Probably stepped in front of a bicycle and of course it stopped. The president put the brakes on, you know, he stood in front of her car and it also stopped, of course, and the street car. I just got lucky with the train was a huge mistake. They say it can't stop in time, but this guy really truly believe he had these abilities and then I get really, really cynical and I started thinking because I think about my ex wife and stuff and crazy stuff and I go, I go, yeah, maybe had an ex wife, maybe not an ex wife, but a wife who said to him, Hey, you know, frankly, I bet you can stop a bicycle, hire some guy next door to take a bike, you know, and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          01:39:11       I bet you can stop a car. Same Guy in the car, you know, stop slams on the brake. You know, he happens also to be the street car driver as well, you know, so he stops and everything else. She says, you know what? You really have these powers and you should step in front of a train and try to stop. So, but that's just me being cynical. So. Yeah. Well, it's a good way to think, especially when you've pulled off what you've pulled off and seen what you've seen. Yeah. Yeah. You should have a show where you bust these mediums. We have a show right now. Um, but it's not really. Here's the intro. It's like you said, right? Networks don't want a debunking show. Yeah. Because that kills all their other show. We had a show years ago where we came out and said it was all an illusion, but they called it magical miracle.

Speaker 3:          01:39:53       And Gallo is on that show and they had taped blowing out of the water. Basically gallows saying stuff that he denied. He said later on, but they had the tape of it and they could have shown that, but they wanted to keep that thing of magic or miracle. And that was geller a fraud. Did girl trick you gotta be careful how you say this because he loves to sue people. Oh, okay. But he started to sell people right now that he's the world's greatest magician, but he's got to be careful with that because he sued people who said that he was a magician and everything else, it is my opinion from everything that I've seen and the Times that I've watched him, that he is cheating and he is using tricks. And I know that I know for a fact he uses some of my methods now as well.

Speaker 3:          01:40:37       I also know when I was working on the show phenomenon the first time I told this story ever, um, so on, I worked on a TV show for now phenomenon. It was finding the next year he, Gallo Criss Angel was on that show as well. And they were the judges on the show and I'm geller calls me out of the blue, which was really unexpected because I've always been on the other side of the fence of gala, you know, with Randy and the skeptical movement in that. And um, he calls me up and he says, hey, how you doing? I said, I'm doing good. He says, well, you know, you're known as the guy that creates a stuff, you know, every mentalist working today is getting a couple of your effects that you've created. Um, and he says, you know, I only have like four or five powers that I've had through the years and if anybody could come up with a new psychic ability for me, it would be you.

Speaker 3:          01:41:25       And I went, wow. How ballsy is that? Right? He's calling sort of like one of his hoping that you're hoping. No, he's hoping I can create a new trick for him that he can tell the world is psychic. Right. But he's also must be hoping that you're not going to expose them. Well, this is the great thing, right? Like even right now when I'm saying this, this is when you hang up, you know, I go, why would he do that? And I thought, well it was just a phone call between me and him. He knows I wasn't expecting it. So I'm not recording it. It's my word against his word. And he can say that I misunderstood that maybe he wanted me to need to come up with an idea of something for him to use his psychic power. So there's many ways you could spin it.

Speaker 3:          01:42:06       When we worked with Chris Angel, Chris, uh, on one of his episodes had geller on there and Chris put a spoon on the table and he said, you know, can you, can you bend that and your. He said, no. He said, well, why not? He said, well, my abilities aren't Oregon writing. So. So if you bent at right now, it would be a trick. Right? And I can't bend it right now. He says, well, if you did bend it, it would be a trick. Right? And Gallo says, well, yeah, if I bent it right now, it would be a trick. And Christmas I got him. I got him, you know, and when he walked away, I said, you don't have him. And he said, well, what do you mean? He just said it was a trick. I said, no, he never said it was a trick.

Speaker 3:          01:42:37       He said if he had to do it in that moment, it would be a trick because it's psychic abilities weren't working. He never says he knows how to do it as a trick. He just said it would have to be a trick. Sure enough, I walked up together later on, he says, you know, I didn't say that. I use tricks. Right? I go, yeah, I know, you know, he's, he's collaborative, like very, very clever and very, very slick. So, and I, you know, I think he's harmed science and took it back and it was one of these things I think why we had to do what we had to do at the time because science was going in this very weird pseudo science direction. I mean, that was back in the days when you had, um, old pyramids that would basically put a razorblade supposedly, and it would show up.

Speaker 3:          01:43:13       And so you got all the pyramids of power and you had. Yeah, I remember that stuff. That stuff was put things into pyramids that sharpened them. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't, didn't work, but it was just, it's all pseudoscience, but it was all this, you know, people wearing a tinfoil hats and just written into the whole thing. Went on and on and on and on. It was a list of just the whole litany of whatever happened to pop off, pop off. I'm just disappeared. Oh, he's back on every night now you can find him on every night. Now the differences this. Right. So he was one of the first ones to send out and you've probably seen them. He would send out these letters that look like there were handwritten. It's obvious now we look at it, we know it's

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       not handwritten, you know, that the printed. But back then people weren't aware of that and it looks like it's handwritten and personal to you. And I would get, because I just signed up when I was at were there that day. I would get an outline of a foot, wear this in your shoe and uh, you know, wrap it up with $20, $50, $100, whatever you put in, you'll get tenfold back. Hey, you know, you get this little piece of water and it came from Bethlehem and you know where that around your neck and then wrap it up with money and send that, send that back. So he was making most of his money, not at the, the events he was making it on the mailings. That's where they will making really making all their money. Took a few years for him to disappear, like about three, four years to him disappear.

Speaker 2:          01:44:34       And after this night show. Yeah. Yeah. And then he came back, but the differences, now he's not using any of those tricks. It's more of a thing that he's on the air and he's going, somebody out there has a headache right now and I'm going to help kill you. Have your migraines. You don't have to if you're just on television. Yeah. You don't have to do anything. Right? You just say that point. There was a heart attack right now. Jesus gonna. Stop at Jay's a stump. That heart attack. That's right guys. Guys on the couch. Whoa. Jesus. He's having heartburn and it goes away. It's like, oh my Gosh, God just failed me. I'm going to send them money. Liter Pepsi. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So, so that's, that's what he's doing now, which is um, I don't know, I just, I, I don't think any of these we should be tax exempt or anything like that.

Speaker 2:          01:45:16       So that's what's terrifying. It's terrifying. Is that they're tax exempt and obviously a fraud. Like how has the government so lax in that? I don't know. I don't know if it's even this whole thing of like I'm not for profit organizations, right? I mean, you know, they, most of them are just fraud. They're fakes as far as I think you should have to prove that a certain percentage is actually going to the cause, the problem with five percent whatever. And you can only have x amount of employees. The rest of the volunteers and the employees can get paid a lot of money to nonprofit will be certain amount of poise. Maybe the president this and this. They can only make x amount of dollars in a nonprofit or organization. They can't make more than that. Or You lose your nonprofit status because you're self sufficient at that point.

Speaker 2:          01:45:56       Yeah, no, I, I agree with you totally. It's very disturbing to me that, I mean, look, scientology sued and won and they became nonprofit. I mean they are. Or rather they became tax exempt because they're, what? They had so much money. They had a religion. Every member's money was pulled to be able to sue anybody to the point to where you couldn't win. Right. Well, they were suing so many people that the irs just gave it. Right. Yeah. I mean, it's really fascinating. It's fascinating how they did that. They actually fought the irs and one. Right, but they got that money from the people that they're the congregation. It's an incredible story really. It, it's just, it's incredible that it's so obvious. I mean, when you got. I mean there's, there's religions, right? That we don't know the origin of. I mean we really don't know who was the original writer of this scroll is that they're fine in Qumran we don't know who wrote is too long ago.

Speaker 2:          01:46:51       Right. But with l Ron Hubbard, they got video of, you know, they know the guy in the video, the guy saying, hey, if you want to make a lot of money, start a religion, not a religion. And he did. And and yeah, when he had the captain's outfit on with ribbons, he gave himself and metals like, what the fuck? Well, you know, that's, that's the front with this stuff is so dangerous. It's just so, so dangerous in the wrong hands. You recognize that it's dangerous because you understand how easy people are to be manipulated, right? Because you've been studying this your whole life and you and you, you know, in a form of it, you do a show. What I really genuinely appreciate is the way you and the way penn really go out of their way to say that this is a trick. This is bullshit.

Speaker 2:          01:47:32       We're bullshitting you. I'm not showing you spooky power. I got in a lot of trouble for that in my early days of performing bind reading a mentalism. The moment that I came out and I would say to p because to me, I think when you come out and you tell people it's not real and you can still do it and they want to tell you that has to be real. That means something. Right. That's. That's impressive to me. I think that's really impressive. There are a lot of performers who are not good performance. They started out not as good performance and they need the people to believe in them in order to get away with a trickery and they never lose that. They always want people to believe. It's a tricky one. So when I started coming out and I started saying, hey, it's magic. It's verbal, it's nonverbal communication.

Speaker 2:          01:48:11       It's all this stuff mixed together to create a show. I'm not a psychic. There is absolutely nothing psychic about what I do. There were quite a few mentalist and the mentalism field back then. There wasn't as many as there are now, who were upset with me dunked and said, if you are a psychic man, the best way to hide it, to say you're not a psychic, right? Yeah, no, that wouldn't be true, except that's not the case. So what's up with the nails? I don't know because we're two hours in here. Tell me what's up with these nails a nail. Okay. Alright. Alright, so this is what I want you to do. I just, you're going to have to describe what's happening. Okay. So this is one of the very first things I started doing. Joe, is this like the nail Polish and nail and I want you to watch what happens.

Speaker 2:          01:48:50       Okay? I'm watching what happens. Oh my God, you're bending it. This is incredible. Your Business, you can see the nail is actually slowly, slowly bending. Outrageous. I like it. You're shaking your hand to showing your powers and the thing about that, take a look at. It's not a trick nail. It's nothing like that. I mean everything I use from silverware to forks to anything that I do is actually just slowly do that. Yeah, no, but I was at the Va, I was at the very end, right? They're like, oh, I can't, I can't do that. So here, hold on another one maybe. Yeah, I'm going to say let's keep got some forks. Yeah, I got some forks. So I want you, I want you to point to a fork. Anyone? Um, how about this one? You want it or do you want me to have that one? I'll take that one. You'll take it. All right. So. So you've heard of people, we've talked about people actually bending silverware, but that one you can't. Yeah, that's the one I want. I'm going to use it. Give me that fucking for the time. This I know what you doing. Give me that fork a fork that's taken bullshit for. No, you can have that fork. John, let's take you a fork.

Speaker 2:          01:49:58       Joe. Try and get this Florida watching. Um, yeah. This was your four incredible. Trying to get this from the far end.

Speaker 2:          01:50:10       What kind of techniques are you using, sir? Tell me then I'll trick forks. Well, we're going to eat with these. Those are, those are actually 100 percent genuine forks. Um, but you can't tell me how you're doing it. It's sleight of hand. That's as much as I can tell you. Okay, let me do it. Do it again so I could watch one more time. You want to watch one more time? Okay. I was hoping have like a bullshit fake fork. Not legit. If I was sitting with you, I'll show you. It's actually no, it's easier if I'm sitting with you. So let's do a here. People can tell. Yep. So what's this one? Ready? Here we go. Okay. So I'm going to shake it like that. Right? You know what? Let's do it this way. Can you wait? Can I move this? Yeah. So hope both hands out like this and I'm just going to. I'm going to hold it right there. I want you to hold that in and hold that in for me. I'm gonna. Have to make it what you want to do. Hold this end as well with that. And I'm going to hold it right in the center. Right there. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:51:09       You're rubbing it. Watch. Oh, you heating it up. Wait, wait. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't force it. Don't force it. Just hold it. Can you feel that? Yeah. Because it's a different kind of metal. No, it's not. Yeah. You're, you're using some sort of fake ass metal and now it's hard again, right, because you're heating it up, right? Is that what it is? What? I'm going to actually get this one to break him, but I'm better now.

Speaker 1:          01:51:34       Chill.

Speaker 2:          01:51:36       Wow. Right? Because it's some bullshit ass metal. I promise you it's not. I have dvds out that teach musicians how to do this. Of course you got to be a magician. No where to get it and it uses any fork anywhere. Anytime. Promise you. But I got Monday. Ben. No bending it this way. If they were made out a special metal, I would never let you keep them because it would be too expensive, but this one's gonna twist all the way around and that. That one's not made a special metal. It's regular metal hold. I got to concentrate. You do use it for real. What kind of wizardry is that, sir? He spun this around and turn it into a not. The thing is he's not going to tell you how he does it. That's the real problem. No, you tell me that it's bullshit, but you won't tell me how you're doing this bullshit. It's very unfortunate that there's different techniques. That's the thing, right? I mean, and I really hope you can come see a show. Sometimes I do things like one person, another person feels it. I tell people to like, name a number, you know, any number at all. Go ahead. 13. Okay. And that would be a common number for lot of people to choose. Sure. You know, there are specific words, if I said to you, think of a number, a name, anywhere it was seven letters or less. Go ahead.

Speaker 2:          01:52:53       Okay, go ahead. Con.

Speaker 2:          01:52:56       Of course, most people wouldn't. Most people that are common words. No, that's not a common word. I had no most people to choose on love or have something like that know along those lines. Uh, you know, a dog or cat, a really common ones. Um, but, but here's, here's the interesting thing. Okay. Okay. So inside this wallet, did you give up on the word because I have chosen or there was no, no, yet inside this wallet I put it in car. I was driving, I was driving earlier on and someone cut you off and you know what doodling, doodling is when you kind of scribbled without even looking. And as you notice inside the hair, you open it up. Tell me what's on there. So I didn't want to touch it. What does it say? It's hard to read. Yeah, it's my handwriting. And doodling. This is a 13 and count. It does

Speaker 1:          01:53:48       shit.

Speaker 2:          01:53:50       Well, it's such bad handwriting that I got to think that you wrote that underneath the table. It's definitely a 13. Right? And, and yeah. Yeah. Wrote it onto the table while we're doing this. What did end up inside the wallet? Because he just shoved it in there. Oh, let's try this. What's that one?

Speaker 2:          01:54:10       All right. We'll try this. I can't promise I'm going to be able to do. Okay. You know what? I got both of you in here. Let's do this. What are we going to do? Right? He's got a bunch of cards on him and second deck of cards, right? That is great. We have 13 and current written on the piece of paper. I should have washed your hands closer. I'm a fan of cards out job. Okay. I'm not picking it now. I'm not going to actually have to pick one up. I am in sort of. I'm going to find it. I'm not going to fanning because I'm not a magician. I'm going to show you the card payment. You're not a magician. I'm a mentalist. What? I'm going to find the cards. I want you to think of any card, any card. I say you get one. Okay. You see it? Yes. Did you get a red card? Excuse me? You get a red card? Yes. Good. So she got a red card and we do. Same with you across the table. I want you to think of any call to get a black card. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:54:55       Do you get one? Yeah. All right. I'm going to ask one question because I have to ask questions sometimes. Try to figure out exactly what it is you're thinking. Okay. Did either one of you choose a high card? Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:55:06       No.

Speaker 2:          01:55:07       Okay. Hi. Cards are hard for me to get, but I will try. All right. Look at me. Don't, don't, don't. She got a red card. I'm going to say your card is probably hearts. Your card over there, Jamie. It's black. Probably. Spades.

Speaker 1:          01:55:28       Nailed it

Speaker 2:          01:55:30       for two spades.

Speaker 1:          01:55:31       Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:55:34       Hearts Klinghardt's. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let me see. That deck of cards. We only had three choices. Yeah. I had a queen of spades and eight of spades. The two of spades and

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       I switched from the queen of spades. Before you asked that question. Higher low. I went low. Low. Went low. Yeah. Why did you do that? Because I thought it was, but I was going to go. He mind fucked. You thought I was going to go high. There's a lot of these kinds of things. It's verbal. Nonverbal. Which magical psychologist. A mixture of all kinds of different things. Twisted up a spoon. It's on. That shouldn't. Yeah, I did that. I definitely want you to come. We go into the magic castle tonight, by the way. Are you? Yeah. You're welcome to come. If it to the comedy store. You're walking. Yeah, I'm working. What time you work in there rather come and see you so I'm not working. You're not going to go ahead and see some friends. My scrubs is actually a good friend of mine, Steve Valentine, I don't know if you know Steve is inactive.

Speaker 3:          01:56:23       No, I don't really graves and crossing Jordan and stuff like that and he's got an interesting story about his life and it's not that a psychological thing as well, which I'm always fascinated with where he was performing magic for years, constantly performing magic and um, he wouldn't be enacted and the magic was kind of a side thing for him, but it started getting away. He'd go on interviews and stuff and they say, you know, aren't you that guy that does kit shows, I want you to do a party for me and so forth. And he could never get the part. So he started denying that he was a, a magician. I just totally left magic completely. People say, yeah, I got your business card. No, that's not me. That wasn't me. That's when he started to be able to act and he started getting the acting jobs and everything.

Speaker 3:          01:57:01       It wasn't till years later that he could go back and be a performer. Wow. And it's a really interesting story, but he does it with magic and teaching and things and yeah. Do you ever work with comedy and Magic Club in Hermosa? No. No. I never have. No. Yeah, it's interesting because he mixes comedy and magic together. Like you'll have like a magician on the show with comedian. This was a few of those back in the days that I worked where it was comedy Magic Club type thing. So yeah, it's a good nights. Did you ever teach this stuff? I teach to other magicians. I have, I have videos of stuff. I have books. Uh, so I definitely do teach, but I don't teach one on one. I never teach it. I just don't have time to teach one on one. I'm always so busy working and trying to teach like this stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:57:43       Like how do you do these things? The metal bending have dvds out on that. The teach musicians how to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I promise you they are not trick foreclose those now. Nails not trick forks. They are. Yeah. Well, just the fact that you could spin a regular fork, right this. Well fuck. Are you doing that man? There was a way. It sort of became the holy grail for me when I can tell you how that came about for me. There was muscle walkie Kyoto I told you that he could actually put it under a chair and he would put it in something and twists that I was doing an article for the national enquirer. I don't even think I could do that with just my hands. What's confused? And a guy shows up. You. Yeah, there was a way. And the guy shows up, a photographer shows up for me and he said, I want you to bend some silverware so you know, I, I go, oh, you know, and I, you know, I go to him, you know, and I go, okay, all right, I'm going to bend something. So I take one and I go like this and next thing you know, it's bending up like that. And then I do another band for him. He says, this is going to take a while, isn't it? I go, yeah. He says, just bend them up with your hand. It's like, well that's cheating,

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       which exactly what I was doing, you know, so I would say that said to cheating. So he says, now go ahead. So I just start bending them up like crazy crazy. And next thing you know, I had a twist and I remember exactly how I got that twist. So I called Randy up on the phone because it was sort of the holy grail thing, looking for a way to actually do it. And I went in there and have one of those telephones. I had the long cord, you know, all the way to the bathroom. And I called Randy and I'm whispering now and say, Hey, I just spent a fortune, you know, with my hands and I'll put a twist in it. And he goes, yeah, so what? I go, no, no, no. And I explained exactly how to do it. Now all the mentalist used that technique. Yeah. So this was a regular fork? Yes. And you twisted that right in front of my face with one hand.

Speaker 1:          01:59:21       Hm.

Speaker 2:          01:59:23       Oh, how the fuck he did it. He not supposed to know he was supposed to enjoy the mystery, Joe. Right. Well, I'm trying. I know that you can be fooled. It's very confusing that I could be fooled so easily because this is a real fork. I know that there's a certain forks that they make out a shitty metal. It's like a nice heat it up and it becomes like Super Bendy. Yeah. That's something that's. I don't want to get too much into methods and so forth, but that's definitely not something I use or would use. Yeah, and that looks just a little weird it jerking off, but I'm trying to get a dental monic ejaculation that may or may not do it. The thing about was weird is that how easy that fork bent when I bend it when you had it, it was very strange. The one that bent really easy when I bend it and he said, Oh, you're doing it on your own. It was so easy to bend, right? Like why would it. Why was it so easy to bend now? I'm can't tell you why at that moment.

Speaker 1:          02:00:13       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          02:00:14       That if you look now, that's that fork right there and take a look at it and see if it's easy to bend. Now you'll see that it's not a heat in this. Fuck her up. I'm going to make it easy to, but it's because at that moment that's the one that I was going to break. I wanted to break that one. It's very confused and it's a job. Well, it's amazing really, because it. You'll let people actually touch the things and someone like me who knows that you're doing a trick because you told me that you're doing a trick and yet I still can't figure out how the fuck can you see me work. You'll see I throw everything across the stage and a lot of stuff. I just leave for people afterwards because I want them to interact with those things. I want them to take them home with.

Speaker 2:          02:00:49       No, I can imagine. Especially the forks. Yeah. After awhile, you know, that's just. He just sat. I mean, you just sit and look at this fork afterwards. You're like, okay, I don't think I could do that. Yeah. I mean if I just gave you a regular fork, Jane, when you think you can do that, spin that. No, I don't think I could twist that thing like that. Remember we were talking about the TV show. We were talking about the TV show earlier is I have a pitch. It's out right now for a series which it looks like it may be going somewhere so I don't wanna say too much about it, but it's bringing back the million dollar challenge and it's going out to James James, Randy million dollar challenge and it's to go out looking for psychics, testing them under proper controls. If they're trying to trick us, maybe I'll expose their methods.

Speaker 2:          02:01:32       I will demonstrate my abilities supposedly to do the exact same thing under certain conditions as and it's sort of what makes me the expert to go out and try to find these things and see what's really going on and it's sort of a brain games meets, meets the bunking meet psychic phenomena, but not every single one is going to be debunking either. It's only going to be really debunking when somebody is purposefully going out and trying to bullshit somebody in trying to fool people will take advantage of people. It's very baffling stuff, but the stuff about talking to be bold and ask them questions and reading their cues. That kind of makes sense, but this doesn't make sense at all. Fork stuff just does not make sense. It's really weird because the PK stuff is something as a mentalist, as a performer, you tend to pick your powers, right?

Speaker 2:          02:02:17       You tend to. Well you wouldn't because you're not as performance ourselves. When we performed this type of stuff, we go, okay, does that fit sort of in the repertoire of my abilities? Do I have x Ray Vision? You know, I drive cars blindfolded, you know dough in there, they put tape over, they see me do something along those lines on your show and it's this thing of like you pick your abilities and this doesn't seem to fit with anything except that your yellow did do this and also said that he could duplicate pictures and read minds once in a while as well. I didn't do too much of the mind reading, but did a little bit of it. Somebody would draw a picture, then he would draw a picture and they would match. So which is a standard mentalism magic trick anyway, but his method is will a little bit more bold.

Speaker 2:          02:02:56       A little bit more direct. Hm. Yeah. I'm still baffled. Stopped being baffled. How could I not be bent some forks? Maybe. Maybe someday I'll teach you how to do all this and I'll tell everybody know that I want that. I want to tell you, don't tell them that again. Tell you you can't tell me. I'll fucking tell everybody then nobody's going to be impressed when you do it. Well, I don't care. I just want everybody to know. Is there anything else that you could do that's fucked up? Uh, I didn't really bring a whole lot because I've kind of just wanted to talk more than anything else. I mean, what you've done as well. It's very, very impressive. Maybe I can do one thing for you. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:03:37       Alright. So see these. You know what they are, right? No. The zener cards. Basically seeing the shapes, basically five shapes that were, um, that were used at Stanford Research Institute. I Duke University, actually not Stanford. Duke University either created by causing her a simple shapes. There's a square, there's a star wavy lines plus in a circle. All right. These are the standard shapes right there. I'm going to try to get you to choose a specific one. Now, psychologically, if I asked you to choose one, which would you say like, I mean, would you even say psychological? The wavy lines that will be psychological because it's right in the middle. And that would be the one. All right, so I'm going to go with um, yeah, I'm going to go with a star. I think star, there's a circle. There's a square. Uh, the plus and the wavy lines are.

Speaker 2:          02:04:24       I'm going to mix them up so you don't know which is which. I'm going to have to look at them in just a second myself to make sure I know exactly where that is. All right. We can do this as the gambling thing or not, but I don't like to do that. She'd probably rip people off strong. I to put that in the right place. Okay, good. So this is what we're going to do. I'm going to take cards and I'm going to ask you, do you think the star is that card you? All you have to do is not choose a star. You're gonna. Choose a star. You won't know why you choose a star, but you will choose the star. All right? You, you won't have a. He just will. And it's gonna be something I do something I say or something that it's going to be something that I'm going to try to make me pick the story.

Speaker 2:          02:05:03       This may or may not work, right? But snaky. Pastor, do you think this is? Do you think I'm going to say yes, that's the star you say? Yes, that's a star uses. Okay. So you're supposed to say no, that's not the star at some point because your idea is not to pick the star. I want you to not pick this up to anyone. So if you think that's the star right, I will. Okay. So you're just gonna say, do you understand? Yes. All right, so here we go. I know you're watching me close. All right, so let's do it again. Hold already. Flipped him around. He makes them up one more time. There's this sneaky hand movements are so confusing. Watch. Okay. No sleep. Tamar, which makes me sad. These spent so much time learning how to move your hands like this. So I'm going to keep it simple. Really simple for you. My opinion. Yeah. Well I've cut it already. So because I want to do it again because I want to make, make it very, very hard. If your job is to not choose the star, right? Okay. Not Choose a star. Ready. All right. So, um, I guess I'll just ask you, do you want this card? No. All right. So you don't want that one. Don't want that one. Do you want that card?

Speaker 2:          02:06:09       Don't choose a star. Yes, I want that one. You sure? That's the one you want. That's the one I want the look. Okay. I want to look there. Look, I don't trust you. Watch my hand. Don't look. Don't look and see what you didn't choose. You didn't choose a circle. She was a plastic, didn't choose the wavy lines or the square. He chose a star. They look out of a bitch. Yeah. Yeah, but that's like sleight of hand, right? Huh? Huh? Well, what? What the hell is that what you're talking about? Which sleight of hand. I try. I try it one more time. Who knows? Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:06:47       To put in there. All right. I hate doing this stuff like this because especially with the amount of people that are listening to this podcast, what happens? Don't know about wrong. If I'm wrong, I looked like an idiot. If you're raw performance. Yeah. Somehow or another. I think you're not going to be wrong. I could be. So once again, I'm going to try and make you choose a star. Okay. Your job is to not use it. Okay. I'm not gonna. Do it again after this. This is the last time. Do you want that card? Yes.

Speaker 2:          02:07:17       That's the one you want. That's the one I want to keep in mind. You did that the first time. Yeah, right. Don't look, don't look square. Circle plus wavy lines. Stick. Look. Dammit. Start. Now. Do you realize that I'm impulsive and then I have no patience for the star immediately. He did it the first time. So you thought that by doing it again, that I would not think that you would do it a second time. Is that what you did? Does that sort of kind of. Not what I did not going to tell us so that he's getting frustrated, right? No, no, no. I'm very impressed. I'm very impressed. Well listen man, this was a lot of fun. It was fun. I enjoyed it. Thanks again for doing the TV show. That was a lot of fun too. And anytime. And thanks for being so well you've done it.

Speaker 2:          02:08:08       You've cleverly navigated the waters being so honest about it being tricks without revealing the tricks and then even doing them in front of me, which is incredibly impressive. This fourth thing, I don't know what to say. Uh, I don't know what to tell you. Thank you. This was fun. I enjoyed it. I really appreciate it for everything. But everything you do and your website is [inaudible] dot com. [inaudible] DOT com, b a c h e dot k. and people can find out all your tour dates, the dates, everything, and you got to see this in real life folks. It's going to fuck you up. Thank you sir. Appreciate it, man.
